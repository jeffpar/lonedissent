MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument next

in No. 73-6038, Drope against Missouri.
Mr. Walsh, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, this in forma pauperis case comes to this Court on
certiorari to the Missouri State court system.

This is a

State court post-conviction proceeding in which the petitioner,
James Drope, is challenging the life sentence imposed upon him
in 1969 by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis for the
somewnat bizarre and improbable crime of raping his own wife.
There are fc'wo issues presented by our petition in
this case.

First is whether the petitioner was unconstitu­

tionally denied his right to a psychiatric exam to determine
his competency to proceed with his trial, in accordance with
this Court's decision of Pate v. Robinson, particularly in
light of his mental history and his attempted suicide during
the course of the trial.
The second question is whether he was unconstitu­
tionally tried in absentia following this suicide attempt which
caused him to be hospitalized for surgery and therefore to
miss the remainder of the trial.
QUESTION:

Did the Missouri Court of Appeals front

4
which you have certiorari now regard both of those issues as
open for its consideration?
MR. WALSH;

Yes, it did, Mr. Justice, absolutely.

It is our position that to state the facts of this
case is to resolve the first issue presented.

It's unnecessary;

I think, to dwell upon the somewhat sordid details of the
crime itself.

Suffice it to say that the petitioner and

four of his so-called friends were charged with raping
petitioner's wife in January of 1969.
The record is perfectly clear that, first of all,
his wife thought that the petitioner was mentally ill and
she signed a statement to the effect that she did not want to
prosecute him and she thought he should have psychiatric
care.
QUESTION: You acknowledge, I suppose, that a person
could be mentally ill, seriously insane, whatever that term
means, and still be competent to stand trial.
MR. WALSH:

Well, the question here, your Honor, is

whether there was a reasonable doubt about the competency to
3tand trial in accordance —■
QUESTION:

I am just talking nox»? about the

distinction between the two.
MR. WALSH:

I think there is grounds fox' claiming

there is a distinction.
QUESTION;

In fact, we are not so — you would have

5
some problem about every verdict that was not guilty by reason
of insanity, because if you reasoned that way, then the
verdict would demonstrate that the person shouldn’t have been
tried in the first place.
MR. WALSH;

Tried in the first place, yes, sir.

But the question here on the first point is whether
there is a reasonable doubt under Pate v. Robinson.
Now, in addition to the wife's testimony, before the
court at the time of the trial was the report of the
psychiatrist which was made within a month of the transaction,
the occurrence which was the subject of the prosecution.
Shuman

Dr.

was the psychiatrist who was seen by the petitioner

at the suggestion of his counsel.

That report is reproduced

in the appendix at pages 8 to 13.
I think it's important to analyze what Dr. Shuman
said.

He examined the petitioner for an hour and a half, and

he found that the petitioner was markedly agitated.

He was

suffering from marked anxiety; he was having difficulty in
talking.

He told the doctor that he heard voices from time

to time, he saw visions of dead people, and he sometimes had
conversations with them.

He had a difficult time relating,

he was circumstantial and irrelevant in his speech, and he
certainly needs the aid of a psychiatrist, said Dr. Shuman.
He was found to be a very neurotic individual with a socio™
pathic personality suffering from sexual perversion, borderline

6
mental deficiency* and chronic anxiety reaction with
depression.
QUESTIONS

And what v/as the date of that examination

in relation to the trial, Mr. Walsh?
MR. WALSH;

That examination was on February 20;

the trial was in June.
This report was attached to a motion for continuance
for the purpose of obtaining a psychiatric examination under
Missouri Chapter 552.

However, when the case was assigned for

trial —• I might add the State of Missouri consented to that
motion, consented to an exam.

But when the case v/as assigned

for trial there was some misunderstanding about the trial date.
Petitioner’s counsel indicated that he thought that the motion
had been granted and the case was going to be continued to
the September term.

However, it was on the docket in June,

it was called and assigned to division, and when it was
assigned, petitioner’s counsel was not there.

He showed up

later that day, and the trial judge,who was plainly irritated
at counsel, refused at that point to grant a continuance or
a psychiatric exam and ordered the trial to begin immediately.
At that point, counsel in the record specifically
stated that he was protesting against going to trial under
those circumstances because his client was not fit to proceed
and should be given a psychiatric exam.
QUESTION;

Who was the State judge?

7
MR. WALSH:

The State judge was David McMullan of

the Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis.
And at that point a specific record was made by
counsel against proceeding, but the trial commenced at that
point.
Wow, at the trial, which started in the afternoon of
June 23rd with the swearing of the jury, the evidence was begun
on the 24th of June.

The victim, the petitioner's wife,

testified about the details of the rape, and she also
testified from the stand that she felt that her husband was
mentally sick and in need of psychiatric care.
She testified that from time to time when he didn't
get his way he would roll down the stairs to manifest his
displeasure.
The State's case was not concluded on the 24th, and
on the morning of the 25th, the next day, when court convened,
the petitioner was not there.

He was on bond, and the court

was advised, evidently by telephone, that he had been shot,
he had shot himself, with a 22 that morning and had been taken
to City Hospital in St. Louis and was undergoing surgery.

It

was called at that time a suicide attempt.
QUESTION;

Had the trial been going on a bit at

this time?
MR. WALSH;

The trial began afternoon of the 23rd

with the swearing of the jury.

Evidence had been taken on the

8
24th, and this was the morning of the 25th.

The State had not

concluded its case.
QUESTION:

This was when

he apprehended that he

might have to appear, that day, was it, or —
MR. WALSH;
to go.

Well, the State still had four witnesses

What he apprehended, I am not quite sure, Mr. Justice.

But in any event he shot himself in the morning, and was
obviously unable to attend the rest of the trial.
QUESTION;

How long was he in the hospital after

that?
MR. WALSH;

Twenty-one days, Mr. Justice.

He was

operated on twice, and he was 21 days in the hospital before
he was released.
Now, at thi3 point counsel for the petitioner moved
for a mistrial saying he had no client and he could not
continue with the trial.

But the trial judge without a hearing

or without any examination of the situation other than the
telephone call he had received summarily ruled that the
petitioner had brought this on himself and that the trial will
proceed.

And the trial did proceed over this objection.

State called four more witnesses.

The

The State put on proof of

the petitioner's prior 1958 conviction for burglary.

There

was argument, of course, and instruction of the jury,and a
finding of guilty was returned by the jury.

And subsequent

to that, under the Missouri second offender statute, the

9
court imposed a life sentence upon the petitioner.
That conviction was affirmed by the Missouri Supreme
Court on direct appeal, and then petitioner filed this
proceeding under a Missouri State post-conviction law which
is Missouri Rule 27.26, the counterpart of habeas corpus,
and counsel was appointed to represent him at that stage.
At the hearing on the 27.26 motion, we brought in
two psychiatrists to testify that a person having the
symptoms and behaving like the petitioner did was in need of
psychiatric care and that there was at least a reasonable
doubt about his ability to proceed with trial and to under­
stand the nature of the proceedings.
QUESTION:

Their examination was how long after

the trial?
MR. WALSH:

They never actually examined him.

This

was on hypothetical.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

I see.
They didn't examine him before and we

had to proceed hypothetically.
Nevertheless, in spite of this rather abundant
record, I think, of at least a doubt about his competency both
to proceed and to excuse himself from the trial, the same
trial judge who ruled on trial matters overruled the motion
under Rule 27.26 for post-conviction relief, and that decision
was affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals.

It is that

10

decision which is hare for review today»
The first point as to the reasonable doubt about
his competency to proceed, we think, is squarely ruled by
this Court*s decision in Pate v. Robinson.

As I said, if

there is a bona f-ide doubt about competency, then a hearing
must be had to determine whether he is fit to proceed,

laid

the test of competency is set forth in this Court's Dusky
opinion, Dusky v. United States, and it’s twofolds

Does he

have sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer with a
reasonable degree of understanding?

And, secondly, does he

have a rational and a factual understanding of the proceedings?
Now, this record is full of denials by the trial

He ignored

He ignored his wife’s testimony

that this man needed psychiatric help.

And finally, he ignored

the suicide attempt as it bore upon his mental state.
QUESTIONS
things separate.

Again, counsel, let's try to keep these

A person could be very much in need of

psychiatric help and still be competent to stand trial, don't
you concede that?
HR. WALSHs

I don’t think so, Mr.

Chief Justice.

If he is in need of psychiatric help, I think you have to ask
a psychiatrist to determine whether he is in fact competent
to proceed.

Whatever is wrong with him will prevent him from

understanding the nature of the proceedings and assisting

11

counsel.
QUESTION:

There are countless cases, hundreds of

them, where psychiatrists have reported in pretrial the
defendant is mentally sick, he is in need of psychiatric care,
but he is competent to stand trial.
MR. WALSH?

That may well be, your Honor, but we

should have had that opportunity here to have a psychiatrist
tell us that.
QUESTION:

I’m only going to the standard now.

Are you suggesting the wife’s view of the matter as a point
that should have alerted the court to order the examination?
MR. WALSH:

Absolutely, one of many, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Do you contend that if anyone is said

to be in need of psychiatric help, the trial can't proceed
until a psychiatrist gives his O.K.?
MR. WALSH:

Well, as a general rule I don’t know ~~

I think that is the practice in the Federal courts, if a
motion is made for a psychiatric exam, I think one is ordered
to avoid problems just like that which we have here.
On fcl*e facts of this case, there are much more than
that.

We have a psychiatrist’s report saying this man has

a difficult time relating, circumstantial and irrelevant in
his speech.

He has trouble talking.

That certainly should

have alerted the court that he’s going to have trouble

coirimunicating with, counsel and understanding what's going on.
The question again — I hate to keep harping on this
but this is the rule of Pate, it's a question whether there's
a doubt.

mentally ill and needs the help of a psychiatrist, I don't
think the trial judge himself can resolve the question of
whether the defect this man has prevents him from being able
to proceed or not.

chapter.
MR. WALSH:

That's right, Mr. Justice.

he is entitled constitutionally to that psychiatric exam.

circumstances were such as to require that hearing an
examination by a psychiatrist to determine his competency to

You don't suggest that every time someone

that in this case.

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:02 p.rn.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Counsel, you may resume.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSH
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER (Continued)
MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice.

The second issue presented by this cases arises under
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment as made
applicable to the States through the fourteenth amendment
and arises out of the problem created by the continuation of
the trial in petitioner's absence after his attempted suicide
on the morning of June 25, 1969.
The petitioner v/as on trial, as I mentioned, for
rape which is punishable by death in the State of Missouri
and was punishable by death at that time, being prior to this
Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, and the death penalty
had not been waived by the State.

Therefore, our position is

that since this was a capital case, according to the decisions
of this Court dating bade to the 1800's, the right to be
present and to confront one's witnesses in a capital case
cannot be waived and, therefore, to continue the trial in the
petitioner's absence v/as a violation of his constitutional
rights.
To my knowledge, this Court has never upheld the
conviction of a defendant who was absent in a capital case
* W4-i,

15
during a major portion of his trial.

And as it will be

recalled, here the defendant missed the testimony of four
witnesses, the proof of his prior conviction, the final
arguments, the instructions, and the verdict itself.
The rule of Diaz v. United States from 1912
recognizes the necessity of the defendant’s right to confront
his witnesses in a capital case —
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that no matter what

the circumstances, if it’s a capital case, if one leaves
the courtroom, disappears, that the trial can't go on?
MR. WALSH:

Well, I think that’s the state of the

law as I understand it today, Mr. Justice.

I recognize that

Illinois v. Allen made some inroads perhaps on that rule.
QUESTION:

Inroads or improvements?

(Laughter.)
MR. WALSHs

Well, that's a different case, actually

because you don't have a situation here where you have a
contemptable defendant —■
QUESTIONi

Of course, even in

..

there

were circumstances under which there was a presence of sorts.
He might have been in his cell on closed-circuit television.
MR. WALSH:

*•

Right.

And as your concurring opinion

*

mentioned, he had the right to reclaim his right to be press.*,
at any time he indicated his willingness.
QUESTION:

But you do go so far as to suggest that

16
our cases really held that if it's a capital crime, the

,

defendant absents himself

even though he just leaves the

courtroom and disappears, that the trial aborts until they
bring him back.
MR. WALSH:

I think that's my understanding of the
?

state of the law.

And Common Law Rule 43, I think, recognizes

that as its dictum

from Diaz, I concede that.

But the Kept

case in the 1880"g and the Lewis case of that era, i think,
stand squarely for that proposition and it has never been
overruled.
QUESTIONs

Those early cases were in a day when no

capital defendant was ever on bail, too, isn't that true?
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Well, I don't know that to be a fact.
Well, were they, until recently?
I just don't know.

But I don't think

the wording of the Diaz opinion indicates that that was the
major consideration.

There were really two cases in which

the defendant was not deemed capable of waiving his right.

One

was when he was in custody,under Diaz, and the other was whan
he was on trial for a capital crime.

And it said, I think

the language said usually in custody, but I don't know whether

Welly in those circumstances I think

if it's a capital case, there are procedures whereby the case
can be continued for a day? perhapsr to allow him to regain his
senses.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

You say "can" or "must"?
Well, I think "should," "must", under

those circumstances.
I recognize that's —
QUESTION:

Well, in any case, I'm trying to say in

this case you don’t have to go that far.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

That's correct.

I think even if --

Why bite off more than you need to?
Well, I think, even in this case, Mr.

Justice, if we assume that the right is waivable — now, I’m
not prepared to do that — and still we contend that the
petitioner here was denied his right to be present because
(a) there was no meaningful evaluation made of whether his
absence from the courtroom was voluntary or involuntary, and
(b) the Missouri State courts placed the burden on him of
proving that it was involuntary.
QUESTION:

The petition, I take it, if I understood

you earlier, you submit there had to be a determination
whether he was capable of a knowing and intelligent —
MR. WALSH:

Precisely.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The State courts presumed that his absence was

18

voluntary and held therefore that it was voluntary without
giving him — held it was voluntary because he had not sustained
the burden of showing that it wasn't»

And all this was done

without reference to his mental state and an inquiry as to
whether in fact he was capable of making a conscious, knowing,
voluntary choice not to be present and to waive his right»
QUESTION:

Do you think it would have been feasible

to continue to suspend this trial and hold the jury somewhere
for 21 days at least while he was in the hospital and probably
a longer period than that?
MR. WALSH:

Well, I think what should have been done

is a mistrial should have been declared and —
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Was it asked for?
It was asked for, yes, sir, and I think

it should have been declared under these circumstances.

All

the court did was say, well, he shot himself; he made the
choice not to be here, let’s go.
QUESTION:

I take it you might not be here either

if the court had refused the continuance, gone on with the
trial, but then immediately at the termination of the trial
just as soon as it was feasible, had the kind of a hearing
that covered the factor that you wanted, and then it was found
that he was competent to stand trial?
MR. WALSH:

I have to say I think that would be a

reasonable procedure, if the burden were appropriately placed

19

and the presumptions were correct and his mental state was
inquired into.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

But the fact is that the hearing held

after trial didn't go into that phase of the matter.
MR. WALSH:

There was no examination of his ability

to make a choice.
QUESTION:
MR. WALSH:

Yes.
But the Court did find it was voluntary,

having erroneously reversed the burden.
QUESTION:
MS. WALSH:

Yes.
We think under Schneckloth v.Bustamante

and Johnson v. Zerbsfc the Court has said that courts should
indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of
constitutional rights,and the right of confrontation, of course,
is squarely included among those.

And without a finding that

he intentionally and knowingly waived his right, it was error
to proceed to try him —•
QUESTION:
be?

What sort of a factual inquiry would that

Supposing that a man on trial for a capital offense

simply jumps

bail and absconds.

Now, will he be heard

to say when he gets back that although he knew he was leaving
the cotfrt and he wouldn't be there for trial, he really didn't
intend to waive his right of confrontation?
MR. WALSH:

Well, your Honor, I think if the

defendant just disappears from the courtroom and doesn't come

20

back, I think, the court has to take some steps to find him
before any determination can be made of whether his absence
is voluntary or involuntary.

He could have had a heart attack,

he could have been hit by a car»
QUESTION:

O.K., but how long do you hold the jury

in a case like that?
MR, WALSH:
QUESTION:

Well, that's a difficult question.
It*s a very difficult question.

I am

interested in your answer to it.
MR. WALSH:

Well, I would think that until a

determination can be made whether his absence is voluntary or
involuntary, you have to hold the jury, and if that's going
to require too much time, you have to declare a mistrial.
QUESTION:

So that simply by absconding, he can abort

the trial.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

I am talking about a capital case, now.
Yes.

In a capital case, by absconding,

he can abort the trial?
MR. WALSH:

That would be my position.

I recognise

that Taylor v. United States, in a noncapital case, said that
that's not correct.

But there it was conceded that his

absence was voluntary.

But in the absence of any determination

or any ability to make a determination whether it's voluntary
or involuntary, I don't think the trial can proceed, unless
perhaps the procedure suggested by Mr. Justice White for a

21

hearing immediately after the trial would suffice.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, all these

Federal cases, weren't they?
MR. WALSH:

..

were

Diaz and Taylor.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The Dias case arose

in the Philippines, but as I read it, it is a Federal
constitutional case.
QUESTION:

Is it clear that they were decided on

constitutional grounds?

As I read them, it is.

I think there
There is a lot of

And it's not completely

clear, frankly.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't be making this argument in

a State where there was no capital punishment?
MR. WALSH:

Not the absolute nonwaivability argument,

no, Mr. Justice,
QUESTION:

Would you be making the same argument

with respect to the necessity for a hearing as to competence?
MR. WALSH:

Yes, absolutely.

As to the question of

whether or not the right is absolutely nonwaivable, we would
not make that argument if this were not a capital —
QUESTION:

I hope your case doesn't turn on that.

MR. WALSH:

In summary, we Missourians are proud

of our Missouri State court system, and justifiably so.
in this case we think something went radically wrong with

But

22

justice.

The Missouri courts in their anxiety to keep this

petitioner off the streets, stepped on his constitutional
rights.

And we think the remedy of this Court in the Pate

case is the appropriate disposition of this matter, namely, to
reverse and remand the judgment with orders to vacate the
conviction and to discharge the petitioner unless he can be
retried within a reasonable time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGF.R:

Thank you, Mr. Walsh.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEIL MacFARLANE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MacFARLMfE;
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I believe petitioner’s counsel, Mr. Walsh, has set

forth the issues very adequately and also most of the fact
situations.
I i-zould like to address myself, first, to point
No. 1, and that, of course, is whether or not the trial court
erred in not granting petitioner a psychiatric hearing or
examination prior to trial to determine his competency.
Pate, of course, required such a hearing or examina”
tion whenever a bona fide doubt of that person's competency
exists.

I think it is necessary to determine or to define what

bona fide doubt of a parson’s competency to proceed is.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the court in Pate

when using the

word "bona fide doubt" simply referring to a provision in the

23
Illinois statute?

The; bona fide doubt wasn't imposed as a

constitutional test, was it?
MR, MacFARLANEs

I believe that's right, your Honor,

But the lower Federal courts have gone on to define it as
substantial facts challenging one's competency or also reasonable
cause to believe one might not be competent.

Reasonable cause,

incidentally, is the language used by Missouri statutes,
I think the real key here, and what I want to
emphasize on behalf of the State of Missouri, is the phrase
"competency to proceed,"

It is not a mental disease or

defect? it is whether or not the person can consult with
counsel, assist in his defense, and whether he has a rational
as well as factual understanding of the proceedings.
Having set the tone for the argument and saying that
it is simply a matter of applying the facts in this case to the
Pate test, I would like to discuss the facts relied on by the
petitioner.

First, in his brief he contends that the very

nature of the crime should point to incompetency to proceed.
And as he stated, the crime involved a rape.

At the time of

the crime, the petitioner was intoxicated or at least had been
drinking for several hours.

So you have intoxication, you

have a sexual perversion involved in the crime.

These

elements or these mental diseases are specifically exempted
under Missouri statute as being cause to believe a man is not
competent to proceed.

24
Logically, I see no reason why a man's sexual
perversion or intoxication means that he cannot consult with
his counsel in a rational manner.
Two other factors are that the petitioner's counsel,
trial counsel, secured a psychiatric examination for him, and
also the report handed down by the psychiatrist.
X would like to quote from that report,
through 12 or 13 of the appendix.
states:

on pages 8

On page 11 the psychiatrist

"There was no sign as to the presence of any delusions,

illusions, hallucinations, obsessions, ideas of reference,
compulsions or phobias."

He goes on to state that "Mr. Drops

was well oriented in all spheres."

He knew what time it was,

obviously, he knew where he was, he knev; what he was doing.
The psychiatrist went on to state that

Mr. Drops"was able,without

trouble,to answer questions testing judgment."

He also said

that he did not find any strong signs of psychosis.
QUESTION:

I don't find that on page 11.

MR. MacFARLANE:

The psychosis statement, your Honor,

is on page 12, three-fourths of the way down the page.
Slightly before the last statement in the middle of
the page the psychiatrist states that "Apparently, abnormal
sexual acts are part of Mr. Drops's own culture."

And he

concludes that Mr. Drope is a neurotic individual, he is a
Sociopath, he has sexual perversions, and that he should be
under the cara of a psychiatrist.

25

But I do want to emphasise the statements by the
psychiatrist that he was able without trouble to answer
questions testing judgment, that he was oriented in all
spheres, and that he was not under any delusions, these
factors, I believe, go to the competency of Mr. Drape to
proceed with trial, they go to the competency of him to
consult with counsel, to reason, to assist in his own defense.
I think on the whole the psychiatric report in
effect substantiates the fact that Mr. Drope was competent
rather than suggest he was incompetent.
Another factor relied on by the petitioner is that
his counsel moved for a continuance and asked for a psychiatric
examination.

The motion for the continuance is found on

page 7 of the appendix, and a close reading of that motion
indicates that he is simply asking for a psychiatric evaluation
based on the psychiatrist's report, wherein the psychiatrist
said he should be under a psychiatrist's care.
Petitioner's counsel did not state that he felt
that petitioner should have psychiatric help.

Ee did not

state anywhere in the record that he ever felt petitioner
could not communicate with him, that he could not assist
him, or that he was not assisting or consulting or helping
him in his defense.
QUESTION;

This reading of the psychiatrist's report,

it is not a typical report on an examination directed to

26

determine competency to stand trial.

It seems almost toi avoid

that issue.
MR. MacFARLANE:

Right* Mr. Chief Justice, it does

not address itself to that problem.
QUESTION:

Where is the

Do you have any specific directions

as to the scops and purpose of the examination?
MR. MacFARIAHE:

No* sir.

This examination* your

Honor* was undertaken merely by petitioner's counsel.

I don't

think the court was ever aware that the examination was being
held.
QUESTION;

I see.

And

he had no specific directions

so far as this record shows from the counsel?
MR. MacFARLANE;

No* your Honor* he did not.

And

it is quite obvious from the report that he did not proceed
under the Missouri statute which sets out certain requirements
and certain findings that must be made in a psychiatric report.
I would also like to point out that the motion for
continuance has really all the earmarks of a dilatory motion
rather than one where the counsel was truly concerned with
his client's competency to proceed.

The trial was initially

set on April — late in April and continued 'till May 26.
This motion was filed on May 27th.

The record does not

indicate why there was a one“day difference.

But the report*

at any rate* came three months after the psychiatrist had

27
handed his report to the petitioner’s counsel.

And at the

beginning of the trial, there was a colloquy between the
court and counsel wherein the court informed counsel that the
assignment division, another division of the Circuit Court
where pretrial motions are held, had advised petitioner’s
counsel that if he was truly serious about the motion, he should
file it in proper form.
Now, petitioner's counsel on this appeal or on this
certiorari has challenged that statement by saying what is
proper form?

The State contends that proper form would be a

motion stating that the man could not communicate or consult
and that he did not follow the Dusky path,

in other words,

he could not assist in his own defense.
Another fact relied on by petitioner is that the
State of Missouri acquiesced in a motion for continuance
and request for psychiatric examination.
policy.

This is simply office

There is no decision whether or not to do it; it is

simply done in all cases by the Circuit Attorney’s office.
Petitioner's wife testified that at times petitioner
would roll down a flight of stairs when he didn't get his
way.

He did this three or four times in a period of eight to

ten years.

As the Court of Appeals stated, this simply

demonstrates the childish nature of the petitioner at times,
but it does not point to any incompetency.
Also, petitioner's wife signed a statement at one

28

time saying she felt the petitioner was mentally ill, should
not go to trial.

This was refuted during the trial.

She

said she signed that statement because she wanted petitioner
to be on the street so he could help support the children.
care and concern was for her children.

Her

And in direct answer

to a question by the petitioner's trial counsel as to whether
or not she felt petitioner was mentally ill, after she had
talked to the psychiatrist, she said, no, she did not.
The most troublesome fact, of course, in this case
is the shooting incident wherein the petitioner apparently
attempted to commit suicide, or at least shot himself on the
morning of the third day of trial.

This in and of itself, of

course, does not establish incompetency to proceed.

.And I think

the facts surrounding this shooting are very important.

The

petitioner had sat through the previous day testimony by his
wife alleging, testifying to all the facts of the crime itself,
and he also heard testimony from people who were at the
police station the day following the incident in which he
confessed to the crime and contended that it had started out as
a joke.

I think at that point he was well aware that there

was overwhelming evidence against him and that he would
probably be convicted.
straits.

In such he was in quite desperate

But it does show that he was very aware of the

situation.
Petitioner has cited in a footnote several cases and

29

asked this Court to compare the fact situations therein, all
going to the question of competency to proceed, x^ith the fact
situation here.

The States also invites the Court to do this.

There is no general rule that can be garnered from those
cases, but I think if the Court will compare them, they will
find that in many of those cases the defendants had a long
history of mental illness, often coupled with violence.
one case there were five repeated acts of suicide.

In

In two

more cases there was legal adjudication of insanity at one
time or another.

In several there was incarceration in an

asylum, and in several also the counsel for those defendants
felt that the defendant could not proceed to trial and could
not assist him and consult with him in a rational manner.
I think it is also important in this case to
consider the evidence
it appeared.

appearing before the court and what time

And I say this because the trial court had the

opportunity to observe the appellant, or the petitioner,
during a day and a half of trial before the man shot himself.
The trial court had the opportunity to observe him consulting
with his counsel and to observe him as he appeared in the
courtroom.

I think at that point it would take a little bit

more evidence to suggest a bona fide doubt of incompetency.
And this, of course, occurred just before the shooting
incident.
Following the trial in a collateral attack on his

30
conviction*, the motion under Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27»26,
i

two psychiatrists testified, and in effect they ’were asked
hypothetical questions and both stated that under these facts
they felt the man should have been psychiatrically examined.
I would like to point out that 'those were"
hypothetical questions.

While one psychiatrist had examined

the petitioner about four months before trial* and that is
the examination contained in the report* neither tested him
for the purpose of competency.

I think a lay witness* if it

could be called a witness*in this case* the trial judge*was
in

a better position to observe that man and to tell whether

or not he could meet the Dusky test.
QUESTION:

What about the defense counsel?

I don't

recall whether I saw anything in the record about his views
on the matter.

Is there something here?

MR. MacFASLANE:

Mr. Chief Justice* his testimony

is conspicuous by its absence* but I think petitioner's counsel
at this stage attempted to get in touch with Mr. Watson and
was unable to do so.
Watson was quite ill.

At the time of the 27.26 hearing* Mr.
There was some suggestion that he be

deposed* but that never happened.

.And his thoughts as to

whether or not the petitioner was incompetent

or whether or

not there was a bona fide doubt as to his competency does
not appear in the record.
In summary of point one, I would like to emphasize

3.1

that, here we are concerned not with mental illness or mental
abnormalities or sexual perversions, or sociopathic tendencies?
but we are concerned with the ability of the petitioner to
understand the charge against him, the facts against him, to
understand the proceedings against him, to consult with his
counsel, to communicate, and to assist and aid in his defense»
And I think if you look through the facts brought forth by
petitioner's counsel, which at first blush might suggest a
bona fide doubt as to petitioner's competency to proceed? a
close analysis of those facts indicate -QUESTION:

Mr. MacFarlane, I suppose the easiest

thing to do would have been to give him the examination
promptly at the close of the trial, as Chief Justice White
suggests.

Then we wouldn't have a case here.
MR. MacFARLANE:

Your Honor, he was given a hearing

at the motion for new trial on his motion

which went only to absence from the ferial, did not go into
his mental competency at all.

That perhaps would have been

a better way to proceed would be to give him a mental
examination, a psychiatric examination.
QUESTION:

Did the State oppose it at that time?

The statement was made that the State was willing to have the
examination pretrial.

Has this always been the State's

position?

I

couldn't put my finger on it.
MR. MacFARLANE:

Your Honor, I think he does, and

the reason for this may be that Dr. Lum is, or was at that
time, an employee of the State vrorking at Malcolm Bliss
Hospital, and he would test people, test defendants for
competency, so he would be much more aware of the standards
to be applied.
He does say on 154 that the suicide atterapt does

QUESTIONS

Neither of those goes directly to the

competency to stand trial.
MR. MacFARLANE:

No, of course, it does not, your

Honor, and that is the point of the State of Missouri that
there is really nothing in the record that points to lack of
ability of the petitioner to assist his counsel and to proceed
in a rational manner.
And point No. 2, of course, concerns the absence
of the petitioner from the trial.

On the morning of the third

day at approximately 8 o'clock in the morning, the testimony
shows that petitioner went to his brother's house to get
some clothes and he went to the basement to get his clothing
and apparently there was a rifle there and he picked it up and

34

shot himself.
Before proceeding with trial, the court did contact
the hospital to check out the explanation of petitioner's
absence as given by his counsel.

They called the police, I

believe, and the police checked and found out he had shot
himself, apparently had attempted suicide.

The court did make

an effort —
QUESTION:

How do you know that?

Was that part of

the proceedings in open court?
MR. MacFARLANE:

On page 63, and this was during the

trial —there is very little on page 63.

It just said the court

has already decided that the matter would proceed for trial.
But then on the motion for new trial, it came out that the
court had called the police and the police had checked out the
story of petitioner's trial counsel, and they found out that
he had indeed shot himself and was in the hospital.

And one

policeman inquired of him, asked him some questions at. the
hospital, and he indicated that he said he would rather be
dead than proceed with the trial.
QUESTION:

Are the proceedings on the motion for

new trial here?

QUESTIONi

That’s all right,

MR. MacFARLANE:

At any rate , the court was aware

of the reason why the petitioner was absent from trial before
proceeding.
Now, first in this point, the question must be
answered as to whether or not a person in a capital case can
ever waive his constitutional right to foe present
QUESTION:

Define a capital case.

MR. MacFARLANE:

In this case, your Honor, because

he could have been sent to the death sentence, I think this
would be a capital offense.
QUESTION:

One where a death penalty might be

imposed under the statute.
MR. McFARLANE:
QUESTION:

Right.

The foundation case relied on by

petitioner is the Diaz case, a 1912 case from this Court.
And the rule from that case is dicta because that was not a
capital case.

It was not necessary for the court to answer

the question whether or not his absence in a capital case
would violate his constitutional rights.

There are many, many

cases interpreting Diaz, but they are all based on the dicta
from that case.

In that case, the

..

from that case

reads that a man who is in custody cannot be Held to voluntarily
absent himself from the trial.

Nor can one who is charged

with a capital offense because he is deemed to suffer the

36

constraint naturally incident to an apprehension of the awful
penalty that would follow conviction.

I am not sure what the

constraint incident to an apprehension of obviously the death
penalty is. that would prevent him from going to trial.

At

any rate, in this case 1 think if petitioner had asked his
counsel, he would have been well aware that the death penalty
while technically could have been imposed, as a practical matter
it would not be.

And I say this simply because of my experience

with the people who are on death row in the Missouri State
penitentiary prior to the Furman decision, and there were no
people on there who had not committed very atrocious acts of
homicide, killing policemen.
one time, and so on.

One person killed 12 people at

The death penalty, while a technical

possibility, was not practical, and in that respect I don't
think there was any apprehension of the death penalty.
I must admit that is pure conjecture, but I think
it is accurate conjecture.
Furthermore, there is no logical reason to differen­
tiate between the person who can absent himself during a
noncapital offense and one who does during a capital offense.
In either case the court would would be left at the whixa or.
caprice of the defendant who could simply disrupt the proceed­
ings and stop the proceedings by absencing himself from the
courtroom.
Moreover, in this case, of course, the death penalty

37
was not assessed, so if he did not ^receive a capital sentence ,
it is hard to determine why the rule of Dias should govern»
The second part of the question —
QUESTION:

Do you have any case in which life

imprisonment was given in absentia?
MR, MacFARLANE:

No, your Honor, I do not.

Well, it could have been given in the Allen case,
Illinois v. Allen.
QUESTION:

Allen was a man in the courtroom wrecking

MR. MacFARLANE:

Yes, I realise that, your Honor.

In

Allen he was charged with armed robbery which carries up to
and including a life sentence.

So life imprisonment could have

MR. MacFARLANE:
QUESTION:

He was absented by the judge.

be absent from the courtroom in a case where he could be
sentenced to life imprisonment.

that petitioner

had shot himself# and the court enlisted the

help of the police to find out if this were true and where
the mem was and what his condition was.

undoubtedly knew that the man had shot himself seriously
and could not appear.

And at that point the trial court

either had to continue with the trial or declare a mistrial.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF

THOMAS C. WALSH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALSH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First of all, with respect to the State9s argument
that the request for a psychiatric examination was not in proper
form, the fact is that there is no form as such in Missouri
law or Missouri practice.

The counsel for the petitioner

clearly stated in the record that he objected to going forward
because his man was not competent to proceed and needed a
psychiatric evaluation and a hearing.
Furthermore, in the Pate v. Robinson case, this Court
noted that a motion isn't even necessary, but if facts come
before the court which indicate a reasonable doubt, then the
court sua 3ponte must order a hearing,under Missouri law

an

examination.
QUESTION:

Very often the prosecutor initiates such

a motion just as a protective measure, does he not?
MR. WALSH:

Yes, sir.

And here they, of course, had

agreed that such an examination and hearing would be appropriate.
Yet it was denied.
Secondly, the State in its brief and the Missouri
Court of Appeals in its opinion failed to come to grips with the

either during the trial or at the motion for new trial, ever
said that the fact that he shot himself, plus all the other
evidence with respect to his mental condition, indicates that
he wasn't competent?
MR. WALSH:

The issue of competency was not presented

at the motion for new trial.
QUESTION:

So neither during the trial nor at the

motion for new trial did the defendant attempt to say that
his shooting himself changes the whole picture with respect to
his competency.
MR. WALSH:

Well, the defendant's testimony was that

he didn’t remember shooting himself.
QUESTION:

He blacked out.

His attorney was there and he made no

such contention.
MR. WALSH:

That's correct, Mr. Justice, and I might

add that that failure of his counsel was one of the grounds
on which we asserted •the incompefcency of counsel on that
matter and in the Missouri Supreme Court on direct appeal.
That point has been abandoned in this Court, but we do feel
that he seriously overlooked that point at that stage.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, if the motion for mistrial had

49

been made and granted by the court, would jeopardy have
attached?
MR. WALSH:
Mr. Justice Powell.

Hot under any rule that I am aware of,
The.Missouri Court of Appeals in its

opinion felt that might be a problem, but it relied on the
?
Jorm case which pulls apart from this case and which was a
case where the defense didn't even request a mistrial.

But

here if the mistrial was caused by the defendant's action, I
don't think he's in a very good position to argue double
jeopardy if he’s reprosecuted.
QUESTION:

Actually, the motion here was for an

acquittal rather than for mistrial, as I read the record.
MR. WALSH:

At the time the trial proceeded in his

No, I would characterise it as a motion for mistrial.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Middle of page 64.

MR. WALSH:

Page 63, Mr. Justice, at the top,

"Your Honor, at this time I am going to move for a mistrial
..i.jV;

in view of the fact that the defendant, I am informed, shot
himself this morning."
QUESTION:

Right.

But if you look over at the next

page, in the middle of the page, "Therefore, Defendant
requests the Court for a Verdict of Acquittal."
MR. WALSH:

That is a motion for a directed verdict

QUESTION:

You think that, is different than the

motion on 63?
MR, WALSH;

Yes.

There are about 30 pages of

transcript deleted there between those two passages, of
additional testimony.
One other point, if I may.

There was no evidence

in the record from which the court found or attempted to find
that the petitioner was actively cooperating with
counsel during the course of this trial.

his

The record is totally

silent on that subject, and I think Pate v, Robinson

minimises any such finding, xf one would have been ma.de anyway,

What about defense counsel' s view of the

matter?
MR. WALSH:

At the time when the 27.26 hearing was

But I am putting it back at the earlier

At the motion for new trial, did defense counsel

file an affidavit or give testimony on the subject?
MR. WALSH:
at that time.

No, sir.

That novel issue was not raised

51
QUESTIONS

He would certainly have been one of the

most competent witnesses on the subject, would he not?
MR. WALSHs

Well, presumably, and why he abandoned

the competency issue —
QUESTION:

Well he could have gone on the stand

himself at the motion for new trial and presented him as a
witness.

And you say there wasn't any evidence of cooperation.

Apparently there was at the motion for new trial.
MR. WALSH:

Not of inability to communicate or to —
Do you see inability to communicate on

It sounds to me like he 'fas

No.
Yes.

Which was —

How long was that after?
It was about three or four months, after

he had healed and was out of the hospital.
QUESTION:

But if the defense counsel had found

difficulty in communicating with him in the first three days
of trial, or in the weeks preceding the trial, preparing for
trial, isn't it reasonable to assume that he would have
filed an affidavit or taken the stand and testified to that
effect?

52
MR, WALSH:

Well, X think it is.

And I don't

understand why he didn’t do that, frankly.
QUESTION:

One explanation would ba the one which

you have abandoned, that he was ineffective.

But another

equally rational explanation would be that ha could not give
any such testimony.
MR. WALSH:

That is correct.

I think — but there

is a problem created in the record by the psychiatrist's
report which specifically talked about this man's difficulty
in communicating, having trouble when talking, being
irrelevant, and not having a good memory, and that sort of
thing.

But I do not have an answer for why counsel did not

raise it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, you appeared in this case in

the courts previously as a volunteer, and you have come here
in that capacity.

Thank you for your assistance to the Court -

and, of course, your assistance to your client.
We thank you, Mr. Attorney General.
MR. WALSH:

Our pleasure, Mr. Chief Justice.

(Whereupon, at 1:53 p.m., the oral argument in
the above-entitled matter was concluded.)
