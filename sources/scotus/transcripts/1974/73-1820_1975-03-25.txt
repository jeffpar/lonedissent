ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. KOHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF HIE APPELLEES
MR. KOHNs

Thank you, Your Honor,

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the

Court s
The issue presented by this case is whether children
were in need due to the unemployment of their fathers can be
denied assistance under the Unemployed Fathers program, solely
because their father is eligible for an amount of unemployment
compensation, no matter how small.
The district court applied the plain meaning of
Section 607Cb)(2)(C)(ii) of Title 42, and held that the statute
only applies to actual receipt, and that the father has an
option of declining to accept his unemployment compensation and
accepting ANFOUF if those benefits are higher.
Just a few days ago this Court, in the case of
Alcala vs, Burns, applied the ordinary language rule, and we
ask the Court to do that in this case and affirm the judgment
of the district court.
First of all, the language of Section 607(b)(2()(c)(ii)

26

is absolutely clear.

It refers to receipt of unemployment

compensation benefits as working the disqualification.

There

is substantial evidence in other provisions of the same
statute that if Congress wanted to say eligibility for
receipt, they knew how to do so.
In the statute — in a section of the statute
immediately preceding the one at issue here# (b)(1) <C), the
court had to — the Congress referred to eligibility
requirements for AFDC, and in the course of that statute which
is enacted on the same day a3 607(b)(2)(C)(ii) the court
used the language "qualified to receive", and refers to
another section of the statute which defines that as being
eligible for the receipt of benefits upon the filing of an
application.
So itfs perfectly clear that .if the Congress had
intended to refer to eligibility for receipt in the subsequent
section they could have done so by referring to section (b)(3),
Also, in section 602, which, as this Court knows,
from the Alcala vs. Burns case, has to do with the requirements
of State plans, which must be included if HEW approval is to
be obtained.

There’s a section 602(a)(12) which ha3 to do

with receipt of Old Age Assistance, and that provision says
that if a family receives —• or if a recipient in a household
receives Old Age Assistance,during the period that he does so
the family is disqualified, or that person cannot be included

27
within the assistance group.
The legislative history of 602(a)(12) which is found
in 1950 U»S„Code and Congressional Administrative News at page
3479 — this is not cited in my brief — indicates that with
respect to that Old Age Assistance provision/ the Congress was
clearly concerned about double benefits,, that a family should
not be able to receive both.
And since the Congress used the language "is receiving"
is that section, and "receives" in the section before the
Court, we think that that is evidence that when Congress was
concerned about double benefits, that was the language they used.
Also in section 602(a)(15), which has to do with
providing advice to recipients of AFDC about birth control, the
Court specifically — the Congress specifically used the language
"eligible for receipt or receiving".
So it's perfectly clear from related provisions of the
Act that when Congress wanted to refer to "eligibility to
receive”, they could do so and they did on several occasions,
QUESTION:

Do you have any specific legislative

history that supports your reading of the statute?
MR. KOIIM:

Your Honor, the — I f£nd the legislative

history very confusing»

I can’t say that it supports me,

can’t say that it goes against m©„

I

I think it’s silent on the

point.
The only time that the Congress referred to this, the

28

disqualification of unemp1oyment compensation benefits was in
a different context.

They were concerned about the situation

where a family was receiving unemployment compensation, it
ran out in the first week of the month or the second week of
the month, and under the 1967 statute the family was then
disqualified from receiving any AFDC for the entire month.
And that was the question that Congress addressed
in the legislative history,
I asked the Court to apply the rule that where the
legislative history would tend to confuse the issue, or sheds
no light on it, that the plain language of the statute should
be followed.
It*s important to recognize that until — from 1935
until 1961, there was no unemployed fathers program.

In 1935,

Congress created the program, it was an optional program to
be applied by the States if they desired to, and they also
made it optional in the States as to whether they wanted to
supplement inadequate unemployment compensation benefits with
AFDC payments.

And of the 22 States that had the program,

all but three permitted supplementation of benefits.
And the obvious reason for doing this was the gross
inequity of having certain children who may have received
20 or 25 dollars of unemployment compensation and then, in
comparison with other families, it could have received several
hundred dollars in terms of AFDC.

29
Now, there*s no question that in 1967 — 1 might
add that at the time the 1960 amendment was enacted, the country
x*as in an economic recession, and at the same time that Congress
enacted this provision, they also enacted the temporary extended
unemployment compensation Act.

So it's clear that while

Congress may have regard unemployment compensation as the first
line of defense, after *61 it was not the exclusive line of
defense.
And Congress recognised the unemployment compensation,
which is not designed to satisfy the needs of the family, might
be inadequate.
In 1962, Congress had the opportunity to revoke the
legislation, or not renew it, and yet they decided to continue
it for another five years,
There's no question that in 1967 Congress made a
change. They no longer provided for the supplement,

liut the

big question is whether they intended to bar all those families
that were receiving unemployment compensation from any
assistance, or whether they were going to permit the family
an option,
\

Now, we argue that the Congress must have intended an

option, not only because the plain language says so, but the
equity — equity demands it. And we argue that this is not -this doesn't undercut the unemployment compensation system,
and that it certainly is designed to make sure that all children

30

who are similarly situated are treated alike„
QUESTION:

FSr. Kohn, has there ever been a time

when the amount of unemployment compensation approximated
the amount of benefits?
MR. KOHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

There’s no question

that in — depending on a particular situation the amount of
unemployment compensation may exceed the amount of AFDC, and
in that situation —
QUESTION s
MR, KOHNt

Even now?
Yes, Your Honor»

Because unemployment

compensation depends entirely on the amount of money that the
wage earner earns, and if you have a wage earner who is making
a good income, with a small family, the amount of unemployment
compensation, which is set at one-half his average weekly
earnings, could very well exceed the amount of AFDC,
But our point is that for low income families and
for the AFDC population, it’s highly unlikely that unemployment
compensations would exceed AFDC,
Now, the State has argued that Congress may have
intended that unemployment compensation benefits in an
inadequate amount could be supplemented with general
assistance, which is a wholly State-funded program, I would
refer the Court — and that that general assistance could
bring the family up to the State needs standard.

In our —

in the Appendix, on pages 29 and 63, the Court will find

31
certain interrogatories that we served on Bert Smith, who is
the Director of AFDC in Vermont, and his answers to the
interrogatories» The answers are on page 63»
And in numbers 8 and 10 he was asked specifically
whether general assistance would bring the family up to the
State needs standard*
highly unlikely.

And he responded that it would be

General assistance is intended as a short-term

resource to deal with emergency situations, it pays the rent,
it pays the oil bill, but it’s highly unlikely that it would
bring the family up.
And as a matter of fact, each of the named plaintiffs
in our case did receive a stipend of general assistance at some
point, when they were receiving unemployment compensation»
In each of those cases the amount of the joint benefits was
below what they would have received under AFDC»
QUESTION: What would be the situation, Mr* Kohn,
hypothetically, if a man unemployed, receiving unemployment
compensation Insurance or

having taken whichever option he

wanted, then on reporting his offered employment that’s suitable
employment but refuses to accept it, would that — that would
affect his unemployment compensation payments, ,1 take it?
MR. KOHN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

What effect would it have on the welfare

MR. KOHN:

Exactly the same.

payments ?

32
QUESTIONS

The same in each case?

MR. KOHN:

Yes, Your Honor*

A recipient of AFDOTJF

is required to actively seek employment? if he refuses to take
it, the family would be disqualified.
That's my understanding.
QUESTION:

That puts a hardship on the family as a

consequence of the conduct of the father, does it not?
MR. KOHN:

That's true, Your Honor,

Rut it's my understanding that that's how the program
operates.
QUESTION: Exactly the same criteria?
MR. KOHN:

I believe so.

QUESTION:

For AFDC-UF, unemployed father,.—

MR. KOHN:

I believe so.

In other words, a

father cannot accept assistance from the State and yet refuse
to go to work if the work is offered.
Also there is a provision of the AFDC statute which
is designed to encourage the man to go to work, so that if he
works under 100 hours a month he can — the income he earns
is deducted from the AFDC grant, but his family still receives
benefits as long as his earnings are below the State needs
standard.
But I believe if he refused to accept suitable
work, there would be a disqualification.
QUESTION:

Of course if he then just left his family,

33
his children wouldn’t suffer because they would continue to get
AFDC under a different part of the program —
MR. KOHN:

That’s correct.

And, as a matter of

fact, that would be a consequence of the — of interpreting
this provision as a mandatory bar.

Fathers are actually

encouraged to leave their families so that the remnants can
receive AFDC under section 606, and the father can continue
drawing his unemployment benefits.
QUF.S TION s

Unh -h unh .

MR. KOHN:

That would be an absolutely absurd

QUESTIONS

Unh-hunh,

res ult.

MR, KOHN:

Also, the children who are hurt are

children whose fathers have been laid off for — or who are
eligible for unemployment compensation.

The paradox is that

if a father quits his job without good cause or for some reason
is ineligible for unemployment compensation, his children are
actually benefitted because they receive more money.
And that’s an incredible result.
QUESTION:

I suppose there’s some difficulty in making

comparisons because the unemployment compensation is a terminal
kind of payment and the welfare payment is open-end, is it not?
MR. KOHN:

Well, I'm not sure —

QUESTION:

Very largely open-end,

MR. KOHN:

I’m not sure that’s true with respect to

34
the UF program, Your Honor.
The UF program is designed to deal with the needs of
children who are deprived of parental care or support due to
the unemployment of the parent.

Like unemployment compensafcion,

the objective is to try to get the parent back to work»

And

if there is suitable employment available, then, once a father
goes back to work, if he's working over 100 hours a month,
the grant would cease.
And it's the same with unemployment compensation.
The big difference in the programs is that one is based on
the actual needs of the family, and the other isn't. The
father could have a marginal job, earning $100 a week, and
if he becomes unemployed, it's entitled to a maximum of $50
a week in benefits, while the family under AFDC could be
eligible,depending on its size, for many hundreds of dollars,
QUESTIONs

More than the father earned when ha was

working at $100 a weak?
MR, KOIIN»

,

Well, that would depend on the size of

the family and other factors, Your Honor,

I suppose it

could be more.
QUESTION:

Well, surely from what you've just said,

I would gather that's true*
MR. KOHN:
might be true.

I would expect in some situations it

If the family meets the eligibility criteria

for AFDC, then the amount of the grant depends on the size

35
of the family and the amount of rent they have to pay, and that
sort of tiling.
And in some cases# I suppose it could exceed his
earnings„
Now, if the Court agrees with us — it is a fact that
since 1963 when this legislation was amended, HEW, even though
its regulation says that it is the receipt of benefits that
works the disqualification, the Secretary has interpreted
this to mean eligibility for receipt,,
And the State and the HEW has argued that this
interpretation should be given great weight by the Court,
We would ask the Court, first of all, if it agrees
with our

and if it agrees with the district court that the

statutory language is plain, then, under Shea vs, Vialpando,
there would be no reason to consider the Secretary's opinion
on the matter.
At any rate, his interpretation is at clear variance
with his own regulation, which does speak in terms of receipt
of assistance.
The —- in footnote 4 of its brief, HEW has suggested
\

.........

that one reason why Congress would not have used the language
"eligibility for receipt" would be that they were concerned
about the gap between the time the father applies for unemploy»
ment compensation and the time that it is granted, with the
implication that AFDC benefits should be available to the family

36

within that period.
This may be true in some circumstances, but I think
it would be a fairly rare situation.

Unemployment compensation

benefits are available after a one-week waiting period.

This

is true in Vermont, and I believe it*s true in most other
States„
Under HEW regulations, the State has 45 days in
which to give an eligible person his AFDC money.

In Vermont

it's a 30-day waiting period, and in Vermont, if there is any
kind of gap between the time the man applies for his
unemployment benefits and the time he gets them, that is
taken care of by general assistance to tide him over.
But it's certainly not the general rule* that any
problem would be created by that hiatus in time.
Now, we have asked the Court that if it should
reverse the district court on the statutory ground, that it
should reach and decide the constitutional question? and the
~ it's true that the district court did not reach that
question»

However, it was fully briefed and argued down­

stairs *-- unlike the Alcala case, it has been briefed in this
Court, and we would argue that the exigencies of the economic
situation require the Court to go ahead and decide that issue.
The case will affect 25 States that have the UF
program, and there are many thousands of children who would be
affected.

37
We believe that the standard of review is that that
was enunciated in the Marino case.

Now, some have argued that

that is sort of a strict rationality standard, and that the
government must shov/ that whatever objective the provision
serves must be furthered by the statutory classification, and
it's our contention that this statutory classification serves
no government purpose.
It certainly doesn’t serve the purposes of -the AFDC-UF
program, which was designed to take care of needy children, and
even if you — even if one of the objectives was to try to make
parents self-supporting and get them back to work, that’s taken
care of by provisions within the AFDC statute,
The government has argued that one rational basis
would be that there has been a historic reliance on unemployment
compensation as the first line of defense for unemployment,
I would say that for purposes of this argument we
would concede that Congress does not have to enact the UF
program if they choose not to, and that there are distinctions
that could be drawn between that and the situations described
in section 606.
But once Congress has recognized the problem and
enacted an Unemployed Fathers program, it can’t then divide
that class of children into subgroups, based on whether the
father receives a source *— some income from a certain source.
And that that is as irrational if they excluded red-headed

38
families from that group.,
Also,, as the legislative history shows , while at one
time unemployment compensation vras considered the first line
of defense, it certainly could not longer be said that that
was true after 1961, when Congress specifically recognized
that unemployment compensation could be supplemented»
QUESTION:

The UP is optional for the States, is

it not?
MR. KOHN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

QUESTION?

The UP program is optional with the

MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Explicitly so.

MR, KOHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION s

How many States have it?

States?

MR. KOIINs

At the present time, 25 States, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

About half.

MR. KOHN:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Exactly half,

Unh-hunh.

While I've interrupted you, you remember yesterday
from the other end of the bench there were stirrings about the
possibility of this not being appealable, this case not being
appealable to this Court.
MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

39
QUESTION 2

Have you given that any thought?

MR. KOHN:

Yes, I have, Your Honor.

In ray judgment, the appeal is properly here on direct
appeal from the three-judge court.
Some members of the Court yesterday referred to a prior
decision of the Court involving the supremacy clause, and it was
suggested that this issue had been settled many years ago.
I think the Court was referring to the Swift vs. Wickham case.
QUESTIONS

That was the case.

MR. KOHN:

Well, a few weeks after Swift was decided,

the Court decided Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers vs. Chicago,
Rock Island, Pacific Railroad, 332 U.S. at 423, and unlike Swift,
which dealt solely with the preemption issue, the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers case involved an attack based both on a
preemption issue and a constitutional ground.
The three-judge court was convened, they did not
decide the constitutional ground, they only decided the pre­
emption issue, and an appeal was taken directly to this Court
from that judgment, and the Court held that it had jurisdiction.
And specifically distinguished the Swift case on the grounds
that in that case no constitutional issue had been presented.
QUESTION:

In the Second Circuit, we have a case —

I guess it’s going to be heard either — well, tomorrow.
Second Circuit, as you know, perhaps has dichotomised —
MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir

The

40

QUESTIONs

And if the district court decides a

case such as tills only on the statutory ground, preemption
ground, if you will, —
MR. KOHN:
QUESTIONt

Yes, sir,
-- it goes to the Court of Appeals, even

though jurisdiction of the district court is purely pendent
because of

by reason of the constitutional claim.

And if

the court decides it on constitutional grounds, it comes
directly here.

We have, as I say, a case to be argued

tomorrow involving just that kind of procedure that's been
developed in the Second Circuit.
MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

And that would suggest, I suppose, that

if this were in the Second Circuit, at least, this case, as
decided by -die district court, would have been appealable to
the Court of Appeals and only to the Court of Appeals.
MR. KOHN:

Well, —

QUESTION:

If it were heard by a single judge?

MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

The statutory issue

could be heard by,a

single judge.
MR. KOHN:

Well, I don't think there's any question

that if the three»judge court in this case had dissolved itself
and sent this back to be decided by a single judge, that the
appeal would have *—

41
QUESTION;

On the statutory grounds,

MR, KOHNs

Yes, sir.

Then the appeal would have

gone to the Court of Appeals,
QUESTIONS

Unh-hunh.

And that is the Second Circuit

premise, right?
MR, KOHNs

Yes, sir? that’s correct.

But if this Court were to decide that a direct appeal
can be taken to this Court from a three-judge court only when
the three-jxidge court has decided the constitutional issue,
that would be a radical departure from prior decisions of the
Court.
QUESTION:
MR. KOHNs

Unh-hunh.
In Hagans v. Lavine, this Court had dictum

which states precisely the contrary.

In the case of Gonsalea

vs. Automatic Employees Credit Union, which I believe was the
,

!

most recent case to deal with it, the Court expressly said —
that had to do with a case where the three-judge court had
denied injunctive relief.
QUESTION?

Yes.

MR. KOHN:

And —

QUESTIONS

On other than constitutional grounds,

MR. KOHNs

Thatfs correct.

And — but the Court expressly said that the decision
would not have an impact on cases where the Court grants an
injunctive relief.

And just as a practical matter it seems to

42

ras that the whole policy of the expedited appeal procedure is
— if a lower federal court has decided a case, issued an
injunction which arguably paralyses a federal statute and
arguably is against the expressed intent of Congress, then
it's important that the issue be resolved immediately.
Whether the Court does that on constitutional grounds
or statutory grounds, I find very — I have a difficult time
understanding why that should make a difference»
QUESTIONS

This could always be dealt with by a

stay, could it not?
MR, KOHNs

By the State?

QUESTION: By a stay of the action.
MR. KOHN:
QUESTION 5

Well, it could be, Your Honor,
And frequently is, is it not?

MR. KOHNs

Well, I'd like —

QUESTION s

Or a single judge does act and there is

no direct appeal.
MR. KOHNs

That's correct, Your Honor, but, as in

this case, where the court

the district court applied the

ordinary language rule, it seemed absolutely clear that what
Congress's intention was.

Now, under those circumstances,

why should the order be stayed pending an appeal through the
Circuit and to the Court of Appeals, which may take a year
and a half?
I might say that in our case —

43
QUESTIONj

But you have to remember that you’re sort

of in federal court at all by virtue of pendent jurisdiction»
MR, KOHNs

Yes ? sir.

QUESTION;

On that»

And that that's not a ~ the

court isn't obliged to undertake that kind of a «—
MR. KOHNs

There is a discretionary aspect? Your

Honor? I understand that»
QUESTION;

And so that you may be in federal court

by suffranc©? anyway.

Unless you can come under 1331? which

you don't say you can,
MR. KOHNs

Oh? I do? Your Honor.

I’ve alleged

Then you don’t even get into this

argument.
MR. KOHN;

Quite possibly,

alternative grounds,

Wa’ve — I’va briefed

I’ve argued jurisdiction on many

I think we can come here on 1331»

I should say? just on this point? that after the
district court made its decision in this case? which
essentially provided, the family with an option? the — on the
agreement of the partias? the State moved for a stay, as was
just suggested, the court x*as unwilling to do that and the
parties agreed that instead of the option? pending the appeal?
unemployment corap benefits would be treated like any other
resource.

And since January of ’74? in the State of Vermont?

44
if a family becomes eligible for unemployment compensation,
he goes over to the welfare office and they give him a
supplement up to the state needs standard#
If the Court had not granted a conditional stay and
just said, No, we've mad© our decision, and the option is
going to apply now? I think the government would argua that
that would be a catastrophic result»
And this is the problem when the appeal has to wend
its way through the Court of Appeals in a situation like this.
Also, there are great public-interest ramifications»
There are 25 States involved.

In every State but Vermont

right now any child whose father is eligible for unemployment
compensation is being denied benefits»

And that's an issue

that should be resolved,
QUESTION:

Has this been litigated in any other

State, this precise issue?
MR, KOHN:

There’s only one other case pending that

I know of, Your Honor, in the State of Maryland; and my
understanding is that it has been stayed pending a decision

on the merits in this Court,
QUESTION: Stayed in the district court?
MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir,

QUESTION:

No decision yet in the district court?

MR. KOHN:

No decision, and I don't know whether

injunctive relief has been granted, but I doubt it.

45
The final question that I'd like to address, if I have
a moment, is a mootness question. The class action in this case
was not certified as a formal class action by the district
court.
And when the Rranosnik case and the Jacobs case came
out, I wrote a letter to the Clerk, I advised him of this, and
also filed an affidavit by one of" our named plaintiffs, a
man named Sarazin, who is presently receiving unemployment
compensation under this so-called Glodgett plan.
I believe that that saves the case from mootness.
And I would also argue that even if it doesn't, and
even if to. Sarazin should go back to work within the next
month or so, that this is the type of problem that's capable of
repetition, yet evading review.
When a man becomes eligible for unemployment and
starts drawing it, one of two things will happen.

Either he

will go back to work, long before the issue could be resolved
in the Supreme Court, or he'll exhaust his benefits.

And, as

was brought out yesterday, with the emergency situation
because of the recession, the benefit period is 39 weeks, with
the emergency legislation passed by Congress it's up to 52,
But itTs highly unlikely that a case could come to tills Court
in that period of time»
QUESTION!

Of course, Erznoznik gives you a remedy

for that in a class action.

46

MRo KOHN:

Yes, Your Honor„

That's true»

Rut it's

my feeling that the named plaintiff has a right to vindicate
his claims, and that — I'm not sure that simply because he
is permitted to bring a class action it would affect other
people, that that would undercut the exception to the mootness
doctrine.
QUESTION:

Well, I think we said in Erznosnik that if

it wasn’t moot as to the named plaintiff, there is no problem»
But if it’s moot as to the named plaintiff, —MR* KOHN;

Well, Brznoznik only dealt with a class

action situation, Your Honor, and it didn’t get into the
exception to the mootness doctrine that this Court enunciated
in Southern Pacific vs. ICC and Moor® v, Ogilyle, where you
were dealing with a specific named plaintiff,
QUESTION:

And there was a possibility of repetition

MR. KOHN:

Yes, sir.

as to him,

And we would argue that the families that we repre­
sent are locked in a cycle of poverty.

It’s highly likely

that they will be off and on this program for the foreseeable
future, particularly with the recession.
And we have some figures which, at this time, are
not a part of the record of the Court, but I’ll be glad to
file it, showing the history of each of these families.
These are figures that were compiled by the Department of

47
Social Welfare in Vermont»

And you will see that in fact there

were periods of unemployment, they would go off unemployment,
go to work for several months, and then they would be bade on
again»
And it's certainly the situation of Mr. Sarazin, who
was unemployed from January *74 until June of *74, worked from
June of *74 until November of *74, and since that time has been
unemployed and is receiving assistance.
QUESTIONS
MR. KOHNs

What is this so-called Glodgett plan?
The Glodgett plan is a plan that was

formulated in Vermont, Your Honor, after ths district court's
decision.

Under the Glodgett plan, instead of the option taking

That’s correct.

And the effect of it is to do exactly what would have
been done had the Court resolved this case on constitutional

All they're doing is testing unemployment compensa-

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT WEINBERGER
MR, PATTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The only point I want to respond to is the question
of whether the appeal lies to this Court or the Court of
Appeals„
At the time we filed our Jurisdictional Statement,
we relied on a statement in Hagans v. Lavine which is properly
characterized as dictum, but which we believe reflected the
law as it then stood.
If the Court — and I think it's obvious — does
wish to reconsider those cases, we'd like permission to file
a supplemental brief, and we request thirty days in which to

49
file it, because it presents a number of questions of — that
are important to government's litigating policy, that I'm not
in a position, to answer at this time»
QUESTION:

Would your brief be in support of the

position that this case is appealable directly to this Court?
MR* PATTON:

I'm not sure, Mr. Justice Stewart,

because, actually, as a practical matter, we would have preferred
to go to the Court of Appeals in this case, because we think we
could have resolved the statutory problem there.

And as a

general matter, the government doesn't have a preference as to
which court to go to, as long as it knows where it's going to
go.
QUES TION:
MR. PATTON:

Unh-hunh.
Rut we do think there's some things that

we ought to consider.
For one thing, the rule ought to be the same as to
State and federal defendants? otherwise, we'll end up with a
situation where, when joined in the same action, the State
defendants go to this Court and the federal defendants go to
the Court of Appeals.
And there are questions about expedited review,
where an injunction has been granted. And those are the kinds
of things that we'd like to consider and submit in our
supplemental brief.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you need thirty days

50

for that, counsel, if you can submit it in less than printed
form, fully printed form?
MR. PATTON:

I wouldn't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

We want to confer with the States# and we also want to talk to
some of the federal agencies # to get their views on the
question.

I would think *»- well, 1 think fifteen days would

be sufficient, if we can dispense with printing.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

We'll expect

it in fifteen days, and if Mr. Kohn wishes to respond, he
may do so in that time.
QUESTION:
to you, does it?

Mr. Patton, this doesn't come as a surprise

wenow recognise the issue, and will respond to it,
