MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Ho. 73-1346, MeLucas against DeChamplain.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORE
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BORK:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This is a direct appeal from the District Court for

the District of Columbia.

The posture of the case has changed

considerably since the briefs were filed.

I believe the only

issue which is now disputed is the question of the power of
the district court to intervene in a court-martial

for the

purpose of controlling a prefiled discovery and protective
order.
The background of the case is this:

The appellee

is an Air Force Master Sergeant who is charged by the Air
Force with, first, conspiring to communicate classified
information to an agent of a foreign government, in this case
the Soviet Union, in violation of Articles 81 and 134 of the
Code of Military Justice and 50 U.S.C. 783(b); second, failing
to obey an Air Force regulation requiring the reporting of
contacts with foreign agents, in violation of Article 32 of
the Military Code; and third, violating 134, the general
Article, by copying classified documents in vio3.ation of
18 U.S.C. 793(b), and attempting to deliver such documents to

4
an unauthorised person in violation of 18 U.S.C. 793(d)»
This court-martial was about to commence when the
appellee began an action in the district court,

-find that

court preliminarily enjoined the Air Force from trying
Appellee Sergeant DeChamplain on any charges laid under
Article 134.

I think that aspect of the district court’s

order is now out of this case, as I discover from counsel’s
brief.
But, secondly, what is in this case, is the
district court’s order that the Air Force is not to try
DeCharaplain on any charges whatsoever without granting full and
unlimited access to certain classified documents.
QUESTIONS

The appealability of the district court’s

order to this court is still in the case.
MR. BORKi
address it.

That is in the case, and I intend to

It is not, however, disputed any longer.

I was

called Friday by Mr. Boudin who said that he now agrees that
this Court has appellate jurisdiction.

And I will say a word

on the subject because, of course, that is not a subject that
Mr. Boudin and I can take out of the case.

It's necessarily

in the case.
But the order which, as a background, is an order
for complete access to 15 documents from the sergeant's prior
trial which are no longer in this trial? the Government does
not intend to rely upon those documents, as well as to 9

documenta which ara in this trial.

And the military order

which the district court found inadequate contemplates that
the Sergeant DeChamplain, his military counsel, his Civilian
League counsel, one associate, one secretary, a foreign policy
expert chosen by him, and a classification expert chosen by
him shall have access to these 9 documents, may make notes, but.
the notes must be left in Air Force custody and they may be —
QUESTION:

But the disclosure is to whom?

T'hd't is,

after these people get them, make them available in the
district court or in the court-martial proceedings?
MR. BGRKs

The district court order is that they

be made available in the court-martial proceeding on —
QUESTION:

Not in the district court.

MR. BQRK:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

The dispute is

really about the degree of freedom the court-martial allows
the access to these documents.

And this appeal followed.

Now, as I say, 134 is no longer in the case, the
general Article, but the appellee did raise the question of
this Court’s appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1252,
and we believe that this Court clearly has such jurisdiction,,
This Court asked that we discuss it in the briefs and discuss
it

on the merits.
Section 1252 provides direct review from a district

court on any interlocutory order of any court in the United
States holding an act of Congress unconstitutional, and this

6

Court did hold Article 134 unconstitutionalr in any civil
action where an officer or employee of the United States is
a party.

So I think the language of section 1252 covers our

case exactly.
Now, the argument appellee made before which raised
the issue was that — he said -chat the jurisdiction of the
district court which he had invoked was in fact faulty because
a three-judge district court was required to consider the
constitutionality of Article 134.

And he then proposed this

case go forward on the merits in the Court of Appeals.

But I

should point out, of course, that if a three-judge court was
required, the Court of Appeals would not have appellate
jurisdiction either, except for the purposes the Xdlewild Bon
Voyage Liquor Corp. case cited in the brief wade clear, to
say that the three-judge court was required to send it back
with instructions to convene such a court, but it could not
hear the merits.
Now, without going into a lot of the argument we have
had on this issue, I think the central .point we agree upon,
the appellee agreed even in its prior position and we agree,
that no three-judge district court was required

if . the

constitutional question as to the Article 134 was insubstantial.
And I think that it x^as insubstantial either on the logic that
appellee was than using or on the logic that we were using.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bork, where you are appealing from a

7
judgment holding a Federal statute unconstitutional under
12521 you don’t find the counterpart of 1253Es language where
the right to appeal turns on whether or not a three-judge
district court was required? do you?
MR. BORK:

Well? no? I don!t think we find the

counterpart in the language? but I assume if there was no
jurisdiction in the district court? there might well be a
question about the jurisdiction here.

Perhaps not.

But I

think the easiest and shortest way to the resolution of this
issue is to show that no three-judge district court was
required under the most expansive reading of the substantial
question.
QUESTION:

Here the district court clearly had

jurisdiction? then the language, of 1252 allows an appeal here.
MR. BORK:

That is quite correct.

That is quite

correct.
The appellee;' s argument on this point before was
that they did not convene a three-judge district court because
the Ayreeh decision holding Article 134 unconstitutional was
a decision of the D.C. Circuit and therefore? whether it was
a three-judge court or a single-judge court? made no difference?
it must follow the Court of Appeals* opinion.
I think if that’s true? then there was no substantial
question for the district court to decide and there is no
point in convening a three-judge district court which must

8
automatically follow the Court of Appeals1 decision.
Our argument was somewhat different.

It was that

there was no substantial question because the district court
misunderstood the question before it.

It was not a question

about the first two sections of Article 134? it was simply
a question about the third section which is an assimilative
crime statute and to which nobody claims there: is a problem
of constitutionality.

So that there was no substantial question

before the district court to decide whether or not idle district
court thought so.

And I think it is indeed the nature of the

question rather than the subjective perception of the judge
that determines jurisdiction.
But perhaps we need not even go as far as that, as
your question suggests, Mr. Justice Relinquish.

But I think

if one goes that far, it is quite clear that there is appellate
jurisdiction in this Court and that, as I say, that is a
subject no longer disputed by appellee.
And the only question left, as I say, is the question
of district court control of the pretrial discovery process
of the court-martial.

And I think it's quite clear that there

is no such power in a district court to intervene at this
stage for that purpose.

I think the military justice system

has a freedom from intervention on such matters similar to
that that the State justice systems have, and that intervention
is justified only when, as Younger v. Harris would put it,

9
there is bad faith or harassment and when the party seeking
relief is threatened with irreparable injury that is both
great and immediate.
In this case the district court made no such findings
as a precondition cf its intervention? and indeed? bad faith
or harassment were not even alleged.

The fact that the

appellee might have to be confined pending the outcome of
the military prosecution and any appeals that follow does not
constitute? is not cognizable as an irreparable injury. That's
an incident of any criminal process? and if that were a grounds
for intervention? Federal courts would be intervening all of
the time in State and military justice appeals systems.
I think the decisionsof this Court rather uniformly
show that this rule against intervention by Article III courts
in military proceedings as in State proceedings rests upon
a cluster of policy factors.

I think some of them are of

constitutional dimension and they are summed up generally in
the words "exhaustion of remedies and comity."

And I think

these policies are so strong, indeed? that the appellee has
not been able to point to a single decision of this Court
sanctioning an intrusion like this one into the military
justice system.

It is an intrusion both unique and it's

continuing because the terms of the district court’s order
contain words which must be construed? and the district court
ho.Xds itself available for application to continue to supervise

10
the access to documents problem.

And all of that takes place

before the appellee has even been tried, much less exhausted
his remedies within the military justice system.
A great deal of the argument in this brief rests
upon, I think, unjustified denigration of the military justice
system.

There is much argument in the brief, the appellee’s

brief, that military tribunals do not apply all of the
procedures that civilian, tribunals do, which is quite true,
but that is not a statement that military tribunals are in any
way lax in applying those procedures which this Coxirt and
Congress has held appropriate for them.
Similarly, I think in an effort to avoid the plain
thrust of cases like Gusik v. Schilder and Younger v. Harris,
the appellee has tried to argue that any remedy he may have
in the military system will be futile.

That seems to be a

very odd claim for a man who has been convicted once by a
court-martial on an espionage charge and has appealed that
conviction and has had it reversed by the Court of Military
Review and has had that reversal sustained by the Court of
Military Appeals.
His real complaint is that he has made three
successive petitions for extraordinary relief prior to his
second trial and that the Court of Military Appeals has
denied them and said that that is extraordinary relief and is
not to be used as a substitute for appeal.

There is no reason

II
here to think that should he be convicted upon a second
court-martial that the Court of Military Appeals and? indeed,
the entire military appellate system would not be fully
sensitive to his constitutional claims.
I will discuss only briefly this Court's opinion
in Gusik v. Sehilder, which is really a much stronger case
for intervention by Article III courts because the serviceman
there had been convicted and had exhausted all of his military
remedies.

After wards a new article gave him the right to

ask for a discretionary new trial to be given by the Judge
Advocate General, and that was the only remedy available to
him and his chances didn't look very good.

But this Court

said that habeas corpus was not available to him until he had
exhausted that remedy.

It seems to me that he had a much

si aimer chance at an adequate remedy at law than does the
appellee here.
The Gusik case itself analogized the requirement
of exhaustion of military remedies to the similar requirement
of exhaustion of remedies within State court systems.

I think

Younger v. Harris, recently decided by this Court, shows the
strength of that requirement.

There it was a prosecution of

a man under the California Criminal Syndicalism Act, an act
of dubious constitutionality, and he raised a first amendment
claim.

It would seem to me much more compelling than the

appellee's claim here because his conduct alleged is espionage

12
which does not fall near any constitutionally protected area.
But I think if one analyzes Younger and this case,
you will find them parallel in many respects.

There is here

not the policy of federalism, which Younger found important,
but there is the constitutional power of Congress to make rules
for the arraed forces which are separate.

There is the same

doctrine of equity jurisprudence against restraining criminal
prosecutions; there is the same adequate remedy of law; and
there is the same absence of a showing of irreparable injury.
There the same need, I think, to avoid friction and
to avoid disruption of the court-martial.

I think in considering

this case, one ought to consider what the general principle at
stake is.

The general principle is really one that would

countenance a general removal power from court-martial for
constitutional issues, and the court below and the appellee
here say that since military courts do not have a special
expertise on such issues, there is no reason to let them
decide them without having a Federal court intervene to
decide them for them.
That would shuttle cases back and forth between the
Article III system and the military system in a way that would
be so disruptive and so costly for everybody concerned it
would be better if the Article III court simply took over
cour£-martial rather than did that.
Now, the only reply the appellee has to all of this,

13
the heart, of his reply is at page 51 of his brief where he
cites a string of cases, Billings v. Truesdale, Toth v. Quarles,
Reid v. Covert, McElroy v. Guagliardc, and he cites those with
the proposition that, this Court has repeatedly sanctioned
interference with ongoing military proceedings to correct
fundamental constitutional errors.
I think not.

I think not.

Those are all cases in

which the person seeking to have the Federal court intervene,
successfully, claimed not to be a member of the armed forces.
The integrity of the military trial process was not at stake,
and the intervention to prevent the court-martial of a person
who is not even subject to military lav/ is hardly the same
kind of disruption.

In fact, those cases can be decided by

the status of the person; he is a civilian, not a military
person.

And then the further legal question of may a court-

martial constitutionally try a civilian under these circumat
stances, which is not/all the same as taking a person who is
concadediy subject to court-martial jurisdiction, concededly
subject to trial and constantly filtering his constitutional
claim out of the military system into the Federal system
perhaps with full appeal and then back into the military system
again.
So far as I can make out, that's about all there is
to the appellee's case;

It is a constitutional issue and

therefore there is no reason why we should let the military

14

courts decide it before the civilian courts do.

Md we have

seen that the intention of Congress and all the policy
considerations underlying this Court’s decisions run to the
contrary.
There is one thing perhaps 1 should mention, and
that is that appellee’s brief mounts an extensive attack upon
the constitutionality of Article 76 of the Code which is the
finality provision and says that it’s unconstitutional if it's
interpreted to mean that the only collateral attack possible
upon a military conviction is by habeas corpus by persons in
confinement.

That gets the appellee into Martin v. Hunter’s

Lessee and Ex Parte McCardle and a very exciting group of
cases to teach, but I think not relevant t© today’s discussion.
We cite Article 76 as evidence of a congressional
intent that the court-martial system be generally free of
interference.

It clearly is that.

We have argued that habeas corpus is the only permissible
form of collateral attack, but that’s not necessary for the
decision of the present case because whatever form of collateral
attack may be available, Younger v. Harris and Gusik v. Schilder
stand for the proposition that it takes place after the
exhaustion of remedies in the military system.
QUESTIONi

Younger v. Harris, as we both know, is

premised a great deal upon what the Court opinion called in
capital letters "Our Federalism."

And that is not an

15
ingredient here.
MR. BORK;

Wo, I think there is a comparable, not as

strong, but there is a constitutional valxae which parallels
that in Congress' constitutional power to provide special
rules and hence special courts for the military.

And I think

all of the policy reasons that are mentioned in Younger v._
Harris are equally applicable here, and I think Gusik v.
Schilder tends to equate the two systems, the State system
and the military system, in terms of non-intervention,
premature intervention,by Federal courts, by Article III
courts.
So I have no doubt that the policy of Younger y.
Harris is fully applicable here and that policy, of course,
was recognized recently in Parisi v. Davidson, a case that ..
appellee cites in that string which is distinguishable and
which this Coux-t takes particular pains to point out that the
policy cited in Gusik v. Schilder is not being breached.
*

>

I might say finally about this point that the
appellee, who is in confinement, I think has no standing to
raise the issue of whether Article 76 would be unconstitutional
if it were applied to somebody who was not in confinement to
prevent him from bringing habeas corupus.

That may be an

issue in some case some day when there is such a person who
is blocked by Article 76 interpreted that way, but I think the
appellee has no standing to raise his case,for his purposes

16

in this case.
To return to the main point then, what we have before
us, as I say, is simply a question of Federal court ~~ we have
before the Supreme Court a question of pretrial discovery in
a court-martial which hasn’t taken place yet.

I think nothing

could show more clearly what a massive disruption of a
coordinate branch of justice we have here.

I think the clear

intention of Congress and the clear policy of the cases of
this Court is to let this court-martial go forward without
interruption.

There is no reason to believe the military

tribunal will be insensitive to any of the appellee's claims
and should they ultimately decide them against him and
incorrectly, he has available habeas corpus, as does anybody
wrongfully convicted in a military system of justice.
QUESTION:

General Bork, if this case were not

pursued in a military system, where would it be venued if it
were on the civilian side?
MR. BORK:

Well, I'm not quite clear where it would

be, Mr. Justice Blackmun, because the offense took place
overseas.

I don't know how we would solve the jurisdictional

problem if it were not a military -- it took place in Thailand,
and I am not sufficiently versed to say whether or not we could
solve the jurisdictional problem and get him into a civilian
Article III court.
success.

I think that’s been tried before without

17
We think for these reasons the case ought to he
reversed and the complaint dismissed.
QUESTION:
you sit down?

May I ask you one more question before

It's probably totally irrelevant.

Did anyone

formally request Judge Parker for the convening of a threejudge court?
MR. BORK:

No.

As I understand it, appellee thought

it was not necessary because the three-judge court would be
bound by the Court of Appeals decision in Avrech.

So they

would have no substantial question to decide in any event.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Boudin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. BOUDIN
OH BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. BOUDIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it p3.ease

We have agreed that the issue of this Court's

jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of it for exactly
tiie reason given by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

While the

application of Stratton and IdlewdId in principle could have
dictated a different result, it is quite true that 1252 is
unambiguous and in the thicket of three-judge court problems
ii,

that have troubled the courts for so long, at least, and we have
come to the conclusion that this is an issue which should be
resolved in favor of the Court's' jurisdiction.
We see three issues here,the second of which has
really not been touched upon by my brother.

The first issue

13
is whether the court-martial judge's refusal to give civilian
defense counsel full access to the prior trial record and to
the very documents that are the subject of these criminal
charges was a violation of the sixth amendment right to the
effective assistance of counsel going to the question of the
?

jurisdiction of the court-martial under Johnson v.

Zerps,

which we did not cite, though it seems the clearest case in
point.
The second question, which, as I say, my brother
did not develop an argument, was whether or not any collateral
review of a court martial decision of this kind, court-martial
action of this kind, other than habeas corpus, is permissible
at some stage of the proceeding.
*

And the third issue, which is rsalXy a central
issue, as we see it, is whether or not given these circumstances
in this particular case, the appropriate remedy of collateral
review was by injunction.
Now, the issues have to be decided in the reverse
order of that dealt with in our brief and in the Government’s
brief, because the question of collateral review and the nature
of it, to wit,

is an injunction needed at an early stage, is

a function of the nature of the constitutional right involved
which we discuss in point

I

orally,

III or V in our brief,

a function of that right and of what actually happened in this
case»

19
-So I turn to the first issue, namely, the effective
assistance of counsel.

This, as we know, is not an abstract

issue. It must be related to the crime charged, 18 U.S.C. 793,
and to the prior history of this case.

We must remember that

Sergeant DeChamplain was arrested in July of 1971, charged
with a violation of the espionage lav/s, among other things,
and having conspired to deliver a package of 25 documents to a
Russian agent in Indochina, and that he has been since July 3,
1971, in pretrial confinement, in post-trial confinement,
and now in pre-trial confinement.

And if the course of events

follows which is suggested by the Government here, he can verywell be in three years more confinement until this case is
finally adjudicated again by this Court.
Now, as I said, the issue in the case of the second
assistant counsel is determined by the nature of the case.
Some problems we had in Powell v. Alabama where we know the
interference that occurred there.
There are other cases such
■>
as Moore v-. -D iripsey where you have a mob scene interfering
with the effectiveness of the court.

?
in the present case, so far as the knoxving documents
ar concerned, just to take those away from the prior trial
record, we have what may appropriately be called the core or
the corpus delicti of the case.

These are the documents whose

transmittal by conspiracy or attempt is a basis of the charges
against DeChamplain.

It is these documents that, like any

20

other corpus in. a crime, whether it’s an obscenity book or
some other analogies the Court may consider, are being
restricted as far as access to me are concerned.
Wow, this would be true in any case, as I say, in
which the very core of the case is being prevented from
getting counsel full access.

We have a very special case here

and that is the complexity of IS U.S.C. 793, the espionage
law.
Your Honors touch on the problem without adequate
or virtually any briefing in several opinions of this Court,
in United States v. Hew York Times and Hew York Times v.
United States, the Pentagon Papers case.

The Supreme Court,

this Court, has passed upon the issue in Gorin where it says
that the matters must be related to national defense to be a
crime.

And in United States v. Heine, Chief Justice Leonard

Hand added another dimension to the problem, increasing the
complexity whether or not the material in those documents were
in the public domain.
How, we had a star example, a long-winded and
notorious example in the Ellsberg case before Judge Byrne
where the most elaborate briefing on the question of the •
meaning of 793 was engaged in, was the subject of a very
tentative decision by Judge Byrne and was the subject of our
being given access to the documents involved, the very top
secret documents, including many that were never given to the

21
New York Times, -chat were never published anywhere, and that
the Government consistently insisted, hence the charge of
the crime, related to the national defense.
We were given those documents, as your Honors will
see from this record here xvithout any limitation whatsoever
except the word of counsel that the following persons, not
disclosed to the Government, were entitled to examine those
papers so that they could advise us as consultants and so
many of them could testify at the trial.
Not only were some 20 consultants and experts
testifying at the trial, but some 40 people, vast numbers,
academicians, mimeograph operators, and a whole corps of
lawyers, more than probably in any other trial, were given
copies of those papers, so-called national defense documents.
In contrast, the military judge here whose decision
is final has said, first, as your Honors will see from
Appendix 61,that he doesn't third: it important that the
matters relate to national defense, and he will not consider
expert testimony on the subject, a strange ruling in light
of the decisions of this Court, and secondly, the military
judge has said that I may examine these documents only in the
presence of a person with security classification, would
include military defense counsel, assuming that S retain them,
because it may be that Mr. DeChamplain and I may decide to
proceed alone, and in which case I would have to have a

22
Government security agent watch me as I examine these papers»
I may not have a copy of them.
"secure" location.

X must examine them at a

I may not take notes — or, to be fairer,

X may take notes, but, they are to be read by the Government
security people.
Now, this is, in this day, under our system of
justice, with all due respect to the military establishment,
1 have a high regard for it, I think the U.S. Court of

Military Appeals and the Uniform System of Justice are a great
advancement over the days of Wellington when he referred to
the soldiers as scum, great advancement, but this is what we
have today,from this military judge in contrast to the whole
procedure.
Nov;, I may say, just to add something, that the
prosecution counsel are under no such limitation.
the whole record.

They have

They can examine the whole prior record,

the nine documents, without limitation, and the 15 that made
up the package of 24.

So they and the trial judges, the

Government, can see these things and 1 may not.

The

suggestion that my military counsel may have a recollection of
what they saw before or may even refresh it by looking at it
doesn't help because they are not allowed to transmit

to me

by note or verbalism the information in these top security
documents.
Nov;, I don't have to contrast this with an obscenity

23
case in which it is obvious counsel may call as many consul­
tants as he wishes to and not being restricted to two
consultants and to two lawyers.

still in my office.

And the Ellsberg files are

I have examined them and the national

security so far doesn’t seem to have been imperiled.
Now, wulth respect to the

prior trial records,

which is a separate but related point, the prior trial record,
as I said, is available to the prosecution.

We would have had

the right at one time to look at it under Article 54c

which

deals with appeals, but that right no longer exists here.
These documents, the .15 documents of the prior trial record,
have to be considered *— any lawyer would consider them in
deciding to try a second case.

The fact that the Government

decides that it will remove in order to keep me from looking
at them 15 documents hardly solves the problem, because those
documents may very well be important and the transcripts of
the earlier record may very well be important for me to decide,
not on the advice of the Government or in its judgment, for
me to decide what is exculpatory.
For example, Sergeant DeChamplain may 'say that the
24 documents, to take a hypothetical thing, 24 documents were

QUESTION:

Have I misrecollected, Mr. Boudin

—

and maybe you have mentioned it —■ that in this second proposed
trial the Government is not going to use —
MR. BOUDIN:

The Government is not going to use them.

They can .look at them.
QUESTION:

-— the documents.

MR. BOUDIN:

They may very well rely upon what was

in the prior trial recorde your Honor is quite rightf to
determine how to cross-examine DeChamplain.

He may want to

get on the witness stand and testify with respect to the 15.
These weren’t 15 separate entries, this was a package deal,
it was a conspiracy with respect to 24.

I don’t know what

the Government has expurgated from the prior record.
QUESTION:
the same charges.

Well, you do know that they are not making
They have eliminated some of their charges.,

MR. BOUDIN:

They have eliminated some of the

25
documents and they say they are no longer charging us with
respect to those 15.
QUESTIONS

Right.

MR. BOUDIN;

But the 15 were part of the original

conspiracy, and I have a right to direct myself to that
original conspiracy which was the basis of the charges and to
see what there is in the record that they have taken away.
I have to depend on them to decide whether, not only the
documents have they removed, but they deleted, they say, all
references to the documents.
As a trial lawyer, or appellate lawyer, I’m not
willing to rely on the Government's decision as to what was in
the prior records.
QUESTION;

Is the entire record of the first trial

sealed?
MR. BOUDIN;

Sealed for the Government.

My military

counsel may look at it, but they can’t tell me about it.
QUESTION:

The entire record?

MR, BOUDIN:

Yes.

I'm only entitled to look at that

part of the record which deals with the 9 documents in this
forthcoming procedure and under the limitations involved.
And, of course, I am only allowed to show it, as I indicated,
to a few people.
Now, this denial, if your Honors please, isn’t a
procedural matter.

It doesn't go to the weight of the evidence

examined very carefully by the Court of Appeals, and this
Court accepted that very careful judgment of the Court of
Appeals in reviewing the evidence.

We are dealing here with a relatively civilized society.
This becomes a mask of the trial when counsel is not permitted
to see the full record of the first trial that led to his
client's conviction and where all of these handicaps are
placed upon counsel.
Now, your Honors, as I said before at the beginning,
there is one case that I think is critical here because it
states a basic principle, and it was Mr. Justice Black's very’
early opinion in the Johnson v. Zerps case, where he said,
"We now go to the question of when you went to
court-martial.

..

A court's jurisdiction at the beginning of

trial may be lost in the course of proceedings through the
failure to complete the court, complete the court" —

for

27
QUESTION?

Johnson v. Zerps was Federal review of

Federal court.
MR. BOUDIN:

Precisely, your Honor, quite true.

—- complete the court ~~ the issue of jurisdiction seems to
be fundamental — "complete the court by providing counsel, for
an accused who was unable to obtain counsel," et cetera, et
cetera.

Repeatedly your Honors will see the words "where

counsel is limited, as handcuffed, one way or the other, or
counsel isn't supplied, then jurisdiction of the court is
affected."
Now, I will pass from this point, pass over the
question of collateral review generally, which is very
thoroughly dealt with in our brief, and turn to what is the
problem raised by the Solicitor General, namely, why injunctive
relief, and wasn't there a Younger case?
In answer to that, I call your Honors’ attentior»,
not only to the majority opinion, but to the opinion of Mr.
Justice Stewart, concurred in by another justice of the Court,
Mr. Justice Harlan,

but limiting myself to the majority

opinion for the moment.

First, the principle of federalism,

as your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, pointed out, was, I think,
central.

I think equally relevant in the case was the fact

there was a Federal statute which didn’t have to be decided
in application, which governed the question of injunctions
against State courts.

28

I think thirdly# if we take Younger *—
QUESTION:

Younger wasn't based on that statute at all.

MR. BOUDIN s

No# it was not.

The Court pointed that

out# but it did mention the statute at the beginning as an
indication of Federal policy.
QUESTION:

Mitehum v. Foster# though# held that the

Civil Rights Act was an exception to that statute# and so
nonetheless Younger applied independently of the statute and
only Younger applied in that kind of a situation.
MR. BOUDIN:

That. I can't answer, your Honor# because

I don't know the case.

But if I may pursue the Younger thing,

limiting myself for the moment to Younger # in the Younger case
the Court did# of course# leave open the question of
irreparable injury# and I do not think one can read Younger
as requiring malice on th© part of the Government to establish
irreparable injury.

The Court in Younger was concerned about

attacking a statute on its face where you are dealing with
two problems, as I pointed out# one that was a statute and
a statute of another sovereignty# the State# and# secondly#
it was attacking it on its face —~

?

QUESTION:

That was Bari v. Landrey in which it was

attacking it on its face.
MR. BOUDIN:
QUESTION:
MR. BOUDIN:

And the Younger was -—

Yes.

It was trying to enjoin a trial

on the ground that a statuta is unconstitutional,
Court said in the majority opinion.

tod this

Constitutionality of

— the combination of the relative remoteness of the controversy,
the impact on the legislative process of the relief sought,
and above all, the amorphous nature of the required line-byline analysis of the statute — I'm quoting from the words of
the Court -— and the problems of veto over legislative
process,

tod I point out we are dealing here not with the

legislative process, but with a tribunal which should not
have the same weight as a State legislature and where there is
nothing amorphous about this.

This Court knows now, as Judge

Parker did below, exactly the extent of the ineffectiveness
of counsel that is predictable in this case.

And as far as

irreparable injury is concerned, let us consider what will
really happen.

I submit, your Honors, that —
QUESTIONS

If irreparable injury is enough, then

Younger is meaningless because you have to show irreparable
injury to ever get any injunction from any court of equity
under any circumstances»
MR. BOUDIN;

I do not think so, your Honor.

I rely

on -QUESTION;
an injunction.

That's just the foundation for ever gettixig

You have to show irreparable injury and the

lack of an adequate remedy at law.
MR. BOUDIN;

But we also have here the problem of

the constitutional right of the defendant, and whether or not
he is to be tried before a tribunal.
Zerps,

Moore v. Dempsey, Johnson v,

and X suspect if Powell v, Alabama were to occur

today, this Court would recognise, I think, in any of those
situations that an injunctive relief could be issued even as
against a State court.
Your Honoris opinion, concurring opinion in Younger v.
Harris, I remind your Honor, is based upon a statute,and the
concern of attacking a statute is very different here from
our concern with respect to a military tribunal, any tribunal,
and your Honor said irreparable injury, both great and

31
immediate, if the statute were patently and flagrantly
unconstitutional on its face.

That's what your Honor said

there in your concurring opinion.
How, here we do not have the problem of a statute.
We have the problem of what a military tribunal is going to do.
This brings me to the point of the relationship between
military tribunals and Federal courts on the one hand and on
the other hand the relationship between State courts and
Federal courts.
A different approach has been taken and I think
will be taken or should be taken, since I may not predict,
by this Court when we deal with the question of military
tribunals as against State tribunals.

We have to remember

that the States, as this Court has said and others have
said, were the original basic repositories of our constitutional
rights.

With all the improvements that have occurred in

military courts, they

still have the military influence

tradition,,this Court has said several times in Paris!,
referred to by the Solicitor General, and has said it also
in ’Npyd and elsewhere and there runs right through that the
line that in terms of military expertise the courts will
defer to the military.
QUESTION;

As a matter of fact, the courts had no

jurisdiction before Burns,

did they?

32

MR. BOUDIN;
QUESTION:

Exactly.
Absolutely none.

And Burns is a recent

case.
MR. BOUDIN:

Burns was a recent case in which the

Court examined the record —
QUESTION:
MR. BOUDIN:
QUESTION:
MR. BOUDIN:

For the first time.
Yes.
In a military case.
Exactly.

Exactly.

And in that case

the Court essentially agreed that there was no merit.

I

don't think the Court was right and I stand by the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion
and by the dissenting Justices.

I refer your Honors

particularly to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion
where he adopted the view on jurisdiction that I have just
suggested to your Honors., that the denial of counsel and the
other errors Mr. Justice Frankfurther was concerned with
affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal.
QUESTION:

But the Solicitor General says habeas

corpus is just fine even in this case.
MR. BOUDIN:

Well, the Solicitor General says habeas

corpus is fine even here, but we have just gone through a
trial and I am suggesting that if collateral review is ever
proper

and I will accept his concession, such as it is,

that it is proper -- this is the time to have the collateral

33

review because our client is presently *' imprisoned .
didn’t have that in Younger v. Harris.

You

Our client has gone

through one unconstitutional deprivation of rights.

Our

client will, if your Honors agree — and I think your Honors
will on this substantive issue — we are going into a trial
knowing that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction, if you
accept my premises, and we are going to have a third trial
and we have been denied relief by the Army from imprisonment,
even pretrial imprisonment, under their system and a district
court in a case which we have appealed has affirmed the
district judge’s decision even though there is no danger of
the client disappearing.
So for these reasons I submit to your Honors that
if you agree that these limitations on counsel unknown to any
civilian court, Federal or State, without precedent at all,
dealing with the core of the case, dealing with the most
complex of statutes — weeks were spent in preparing the
proposed charges that Judge Byrne in the Sllsberg case on
17093 applies, and bearing in mind the military judge’s
statement that all of this is irrelevant despite Gorin,
despite Heine.

I submit that if there is a case in our

universe in which an injunction is the proper remedy,and
sometimes it is the proper remedy, this case against a
military judge, not a statute, not a State court, thxs
case against a military judge calls for the injunctive relief

we have sought.
I thank your Honors»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Boudin.

Do.you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BQRK
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BORK:

Just t.o make the observation. Mr. Chief

Justice, that in this case there is no charge that anything
the military has done has not been done in good, faith,, and
that what is being told to us here is that we must take this
case on

a rather hypothetical basis now and discuss the

constitutional issues

Had we followed this procedure all

the way through, Sergeant DeChamplain’s original court-martial
would have been stopped while we litigated the use of his
statements in the first court-martial up through $;hese courts,
and then went back to the court-martial.
QUESTIONS

Is the entire record of the original trial

under seal?
MR. BORIC:

I believe it is,your Honor.

It has to be

on a regional basis.
QUESTION:

Everything.

MR. BORK:

It is.

And nothing — the documents used

in that original trial, because of the access problem are not
going to be used, 15 oi them are not going to be used- in
this trial, and only 9 documents are <*oing to be used in this

35

triale
My point simply is although Mr. Boudin complains
about the necessity to go up to a court-martial and have it
appealed^ come back and have it retried.

That happens in

many systems of justice, and the alternative he offers us is
Federal court intervenfcion whenever the constitutional issue
arises in a court-martial.

So that we will have massive

disruptions and perhaps never complete these trials.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say, Mr. solicitor

General, from what has been said so far in this case that
the more sensitive the material involved in an alleged
espionage case, the less possibility there is of successful
prosecution?
MR. BORK:

Well, if the rule is, Mr. Chief Justice,

that no limitation of any sort upon the use of notes is ever
possible, then, of course, it follows that the more sensitive
the material, the less possible it is ever to prosecute anybody
because if sensible limitations can't bs used on the review
of the documents to flow through the world and on which notes
are allowed out to flow through the world, then I think
prosecution often is impossible.

I regret ,that I was not in

the Bllsberg case and cannot draw parallels between the
protective order there and the protective order here.

Perhaps

the documents were of different sensitivities.

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, what restrictions,

36

if any, were imposed with respect to the f? documents that are
to be used in the trial?
MR. BORK:

The restrictions,- as the matter stands

now, Sergeant DeChamplain — the military restrictions imposed
by ~~
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. BORIC;

Sergeant DeChamplain, his military

counsel, his civilian lead counself one associate, I believe,
one secretary, one foreign policy expert, and. one classifica­
tions systems expert may all have access to the documents.
They may not take the documents home with them.

They can

work on them under Air Force — the documents remain in Air
Force custody in that sense — they may work on the documents
there.

They may make notes.

The notes, if they are sensitive,

must foe left in Air Force custody, as I understand it.

t

don't think Mr. Boudin suggested that Air Force would foe
reading his notes.

I suppose there can be a protective order

worked out so that that doesn't happen.
But there is considerable access to these documents
by counsel, military and civilian, by the client, and by
experts.

Nov;, it may turn out ultimately, if this case is

tried and the facts are all developed, it may turn out that
some court will think that not an adequate access.

I don't

think that question can be decided on this kind of a record
at this time, and that's a very strong argument against
