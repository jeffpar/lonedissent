PROCE E DINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

VJe will hear arguments

first this morning in 73-^77, Gerstein against Pugh.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the due process
clause of the 14 th Amendment requires that every state
and every county, as well as the federal courts, establish
a system of preliminary hearings before a judicial officer
after the filing of an information by a prosecutor.
Now, while many jurisdictions require such
hearings before the filing of an information, the procedures
in many of the states are patterned after the federal rules
of criminal procedure and the Federal Magistrate’s Act,
which say that, after an information is filed, just as
after an indictment is filed, there is no longer a right to
a preliminary hearing.
The United States has filed a brief in this case
at the request of the Court because of our interest in
sustaining the constitutionality of the federal rule,
which would be unconstitutional if the court of appeals’

4
decision were upheld in this case and our particular
interest is on the impact it would have in the District of
Columbia, where about 6,500 misdemeanors are filed each
year by way of information,
Q

Are you speaking now of the local court or of

the federal district court?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I am speaking of the Superior

Court of the District of Columbia, but of course, there
the United States Attorney acts as the local prosecutor.
This case was argued last term and the Court is
familiar with the facts, but, briefly, what happened in
this case is that two prisoners originally, who had been
charged by information in Dade County, Florida, by way of
information -— one with a felony, which is permissible in
many, many of the states and the other with a misdemeanor,
they filed a class action suit in the United States District
Court and they sought and obtained an injunction and a
declaration at a preliminary hearing before a committee
magistrate was required by due process, prior to trial
and after the filing of the information.
During the course of the litigation, there was a
tremendous change in Florida procedures, which Mr. Mellon
and Mr. Marky may speak to and the Florida rules were
amended to provide that a preliminary hearing is
required in felony cases, but that if an information or

indictment was filed, that there is no longer such a. right,
so it is very similar to the

federal rules and nearly

identical to the Superior Court, of the District of Columbia
rules, which only requires preliminary hearings prior to
indictment in felony cases but not at all in misdemeanor
cases.
The district court held that there was a 14th
Amendment violation of due process violation and that by
excluding misdemeanants, there was a due process and equal
protection violation.
The court of appeals affirmed in substantial
part, but held that the requirement of preliminary hearing
after information was limited to those people in custody,
which is why we argue that really what is involved in this
case is ball, if the question is detention.
We think it is important at the beginning to
understand something which the district court and the
court of appeals did not appear to understand and that is
the difference between an initial appearance, a preliminary
hearing and an arraignment and the difference between a
complaint and indictment and an information.
Q

Mow, are you talking about Florida or the federal

system?
MR, FRIEDMAN:
quite similar.

Well, 1 think the systems are

6
Q

Similar, but as I have been a.ble to study this,

I think really you have variations —- 51 separate
variations.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

And that is one of the real

problems in this case.
Q

I know It is.

So that is the reason I xtfas

asking you, what system are you talking about?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, we were talking about the

federal system as a model In the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia, which is virtually identical to
that.

But we think that some of the principles, of

course, apply across the board, but the distinctions
between the systems would be the real problem in saying
that the Constitution requires preliminary hearings
regardless of the way that system works.
Q

Well, at least one should be very careful of his

nomenclature, I would say, because a phrase that means one
thing in one state means something quite different in
another state.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

You are absolutely correct,

Mr. Justice Stewart and one of the problems in the court
below was that they seemed to be concerned with the fact
that they said there was a statute on the books for years
which required preliminary hearing but the statute they
cited in their opinion did not require preliminary

7
hearings at all, but required an initial appearance without
undue delay and the purpose of an initial appearance in
that system, it seems, and in the federal system, is solely
to make sure that a man is brought before a magistrate
shortly after arrest without unnessary delay.
Q

There is no probable cause

determination there

at all.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No probable cause determination

at all.
Q

And of

course, opinions in both MeNabb and

Mallory were quite inaccurate, were they not?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

I believe so, your Honor, because

there is no probable cause determination.
at that point
Q

All that occurs

it is very important --

Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

-- but all that occurs at that

point is that a man is advised of his rights
Q

Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

— he is appointed counsel if he

is entitled to one, if he is an indigent, bail is set,
which is most important, and he is also advised of his right
to a preliminary hearing and the preliminary hearing is the
proceeding at which probable cause Is determined.
But under the federal rules, if an information
or indictment is filed before the date set for the

8
preliminary hearing, there is no longer that right.
Now, the reason for that, we think historically,
and even today in many jurisdictions, is that because the
document that is filed in court initially is a complaint
and a complaint is an informal charging document and some
jurisdictions still —- and I understand even in some
counties in Maryland, a citizen can come in and file a
complaint.

That causes the Sheriff to issue an arrest

warrant or cause an arrest to be made and the man is
brought in, bail is set and, that being only a citizen
or being only a police officer — as it is in many
circumstances -— properly, the rules of many states and
the federal rules say, "That is not enough to hold a man
for a lengthy period of time.

Someone whould determine

if there is enough evidence to support that complaint"
and it is our view that that someone can be any one of
three people, but not two of three, and those three people
or institutions are —
Q

Under the system of authority, can he be held

for 30 days without bail?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

My

understanding is, not any

longer, your Honor.
Q

What do you mean, "Your understanding"?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

rules,

My understanding of the federal

Florida rulesSis that they were amended during the

9
course of this very litigation and there is now a period of
48 or 96 hours on that and I think that Mr. Mellon, who is
from the State of Florida, will tell you precisely and I
cannot, I'm afraid, what it is.
He must be brought before a magistrate.

Bail

must be set and a preliminary hearing must be set, I believe
within seven days, which is in a shorter period of time
within the federal rules, in which is 10 days.
Q

The case before us, they did 30 days.

They had

30 days.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

At that time, yes, before tne

amendment to the Florida rules.
Q

Then you just shifted the rules now.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, they've accorded people

substantial rights that did not exist before by shifting
the rules.
Q

Could they shift them back tomorrow?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Could they?

I suppose that there

would be a tremendous constitutional problem if there
wasn’t at least a bail hearing shortly afterwards and if
there wasn't an initial appearance where one was advised of
his rights.

Do I don't think that they could shift them

back to the way they were before.
One has to be brought before a magistrate without
undue delay and one reason for that is so bail can be set.

10

Q

You seem to be agreeing that it was unconstitu­

tional to hold this man in this case.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think if no bail determination

was made within 30 days,, yes , and if no deter —
Q

Is that true in this case?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

My understanding is that there

was no determination made.

But our point in this —- in

terms of a constitutional rule* is that the federal rules
comply with the Constitution, if they comply with due
process, because, under the federal rules, bail is set
and if you are concerned about detention, bail is the
answer, not a preliminary hearing and under the federal
rules, within 10 days if a man is in custody, he has the
preliminary hearing.
The purpose of that preliminary hearing, though,
no longer exists after an information is filed because
some appropriate institution has determined that there is
enough evidence to file a formal charge and make the man
stand trial on that formal charge.
Q

You were about to say that there were three who

could make it and would you enlarge on that a little?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

are three possible institutions.
those institutions.

There

The prosecutor is one of

The grand jury is another of those

institutions and the magistrate is yet a third.

Someone

11
looks at the evidence behind that informal charge, behind
that complaint, and the reason for saying that a magistrate
comes Into the system at all, we think — and we think
h istory supports us in this, is because a man ought not to,
Mr. Justice Marshall, sit in jail on an Informal complaint
by a police officer or a citizen without somebody looking
at the evidence.

It is the magistrate unless either the

prosecutor or the grand jury acts in the interim.
A formal charge is very different, though.
prosecutor has an oath of office which he must uphold.
looks at the evidence.
on.

That
He

He must obtain a conviction later

He has certain duties as an officer of the court.

His

very function is to make that decision.
Indeed, when a grand jury is interposed, we
submit, the prosecutor performs a very, very important role
even there.

He is advisor to the grand jury and,

realistically, he directs the activities of the grand jury
and he must sign the indictment, at least under the Fifth
Circuit’s view in Cox.
Q

So the three institutions are prosecutor,

magistrate and what was the third?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Or grand jury.

Or grand jury.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

One of those three has to look at

what stands behind an informal complaint.

12
Q

Do you see this as a Fourth Amendment problem or

as a due process problem?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
We see it

We see it as a due process problem.

only as a due process problem because the

issuance of warrants, whether they be arrest warrants or
search warrants, is really a different situation from the
filing of an information.
The tradition has been that the magistrate makes
that judgment to cause an arrest to be made and to evaluate
probable cause for that purpose but an information is
itself a determination of probable cause which may result
in arrests it is true.

But the man must

stand trial on

the basis of that information and under decisions of this
court, even if there be an illegal arrest, if someone is
brought before the court Improperly, that still does not
mean that he doesn't have to stand trial on the charge.
If the court has jurisdiction and if the proper
authority has filed the charging document, he has got to
stand trial.

His only real remedy is if some evidence

was seized in the course of that illegal arrest or that
illegal seizure and then it Is suppressed under the
exclusionary rule.
It has nothing to do with whether the court has
jurisdiction of trial.
Q

Well, it does have something to do with whether or

not a person who is presumptively innocent

and we begin

with that —MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

We certainly do.

— can be held in custody without any determination

of probable cause to hold him in custody.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, our view on that is that the

prosecutor, in effect, makes that determination that there
is probable cause.
Q

Well, that certainly Is quite contrary to all

Fourth Amendment law, isn’t it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It Is contrary to Fourth Amendment
f

law which says that in cases where warrant is required, the
magistrate is the one that issues it but there is no Fourth
Amendment law that I know of that says that warrants are
required in all circumstances, that arrest warrants are
required in all circumstances.
Q

That Is, you are speaking now of the ordinary

street arrest in an emergency where the policeman makes
the first determination?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Either in an emergency or by statute

in most states and in the federal system of any felony arrest
can be made without a warrant.

And a misdemeanor arrest

can be made without a warrant if it occurs within the
officer’s presence.
It is only in those circumstances where statute

14
or common law, as It is developed, has said a warrant is
required that then the court has said that it is the
magistrate who determines whether there is enough for the
issuance of a warrant and so our view is that cases like
Shadwlck — well, first of all,our view is that that the
arrest and the search situation are somewhat different
under the cases of this Court and, second, the cases like
Shadwick and Coolidge go to those situations where a
warrant is required.

Then a magistrate makes a judgment.

But the filing of an information, although it
may result in a man being brought before a court, is not
an arrest and whether or not he is detained is not
decided by that prosecutor.

It is really decided by the

magistrate, who looks at the strength of the evidence
although he does not make a probable cause determination,
looks at the likelihood of flight and then, under the 8th
Amendment and under the statute, certainly the federal
statute, the presumption is release, personal recognizance
or conditional release unless there are no valid conditions
which will reasonably assure his appearance at court.
Q

But that is not probable cause determination,

nor is it the equivalent of any kind of a due process
hearing, is it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
due process hearing.

I think it is the equivalent of a

It is a probable cause hearing.

15
Q

Well, to determine — not probable cause —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

To determine likelihood of flight.

Q

Right.

Quite a different purpose.

Q

Mr. FRiedman. who issued the complaint formally?

Before you had this procedure you say you had a complaint
procedure.

Who made the complaint in Florida?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In Florida, I frankly am not

positive of the answer to

that question.

In many

jurisdictions —
Q

Well, could the prosecutor do it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The prosecutor could authorize

a police officer to file a complaint.
Q

That is usually what is done, isn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is often what is done,

although there are many, many jurisdictions —
Q.

Only now instead of issuing a complaint, he

issues an information,
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

They are very different.

And that changes the whole ball game.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It does change the whole ball

game.
Q

But

it is the same man doing it.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The same man doing it In some

jurisdictions.
Q

It is the same detached man doing it.

16
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

It is the same —

Is the prosecutor any more detached now than he

was then?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Ho vi?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

Much more so.

Because —

Assume it is the same man.

How is he more

detached now?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because when he authorizes a

police officer to file a complaint, and In many juris­
dictions he doesn’t even know that the police officer has
filed a complaint, but In those where he does, it is a
quick, perhaps hurried decision.

A man is brought in.

You got to get him before a magistrate without undue delay
and he says, okay, file the complaint and we’ll look at
it later.
But the information is different and this Court
has said that the Information is different in Ocampo and
in Lem Woon, In
Q

Hurtado and all of those cases —

Well, we are talking about Florida.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, the point that we, the

United States, as Amicus Curiae, are trying to make is
that any decision of this Court in this ease, unless very
narrowly confined, Is going to have implications throughout
the country in situations and in systems vrhlch are very

17
different, even from county to county within a particular
state and that is our primary concern.
In terms of Florida, if I am not as well-versed
in terms of Florida procedure as — as you would like to
have me, I apologize, but Mr. Mellon and Mr. Markey —
Q

Well, you are the first one arguing.

That is

why -—
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

I understand.

I’ll wait, then, if that is the way you want it.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, sir.

In terms of your question, Mr. Justice Stewart,
about whether the bail hearing itself comports with due
process, we think — first of all, you really have to look
at the whole criminal justice system from start to finish.
You shouldn't really focus in on one phase of It, that
being the charging decision and so long as there Is prompt
appearance before a magistrate, so long as there Is a bail
determination — at which the defendant has a right to be
heard, certainly, and a right to present whatever indication
he can that he is likely to appear, that he has community
ties and so on, that you have an information which gives
them notice and the information like the indictment is
sufficient to give them notice and I need not dwell, I don't
think, on all of the rights that attend a criminal trial
with the ultimate determination of guilt or innocence that

18
is made and so the prosecutor is not much different from
the grand jury in this kind of a situation and there is no
review of that grand jury decision.
Q

Well, in a few states, there is a preliminary

hearing after a grand jury indictment.
with that?

Are you familiar

Michigan and Oklahoma.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

some places.

I know that that does exist in

But the question is, does the Constitution

require it?
Q

Of course it is.

Neither one of these hearings,

either the prompt appearance before the magistrate nor the
bail hearing is directed to the question of probable cause
to hold this person in custody.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is true.

That Is correct, Is it not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is true.

It is not — let me rephrase that just a little
bit.

It. is not directed to the question of probable cause

to hold the person for the action of the grand jury or the
prosecutor and for trial in a court of competent juris­
diction.
It is directed to whether or not he ought to be
held in custody.
Q

Yes.

On those —
Well, on the bail.

possibility or the risk of flight.

That is, the

19
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Plus the gravity of the charge —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

And the weight of the evidence.

And all the various other factors.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

Yes, that Is correct.

Insofar as relates to flight.

Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Now, we submit that that is —- that

is enough in terms of what the Constitution says to consider
all those factors, to consider in an informal way.

It is

no less formal, certainly, than the procedures that normally
apply at the time of sentencing when a man's liberty is
maybe permanently deprived.
Q

Well, that is after a determination of guilt —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

This is a --

Correct.

— beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury or by a

trial judge.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It is.

That is correct and that is

an obvious distinction which does make a difference.

But

the procedures that are involved are very, very similar.
We do think, though, that the bail hearing is
important because it is not the prosecutor's judgment that
forces the man to be held in custody.

The prosecutor's

judgment that there is enough evidence to make the man
stand trial, yes.

That brings him before the court.

But

whether he stays in custody is a judgment made by a neutral,

20

detached, independent magistrate.
Q

But it is not made on the basis of whether or

not there is probable cause.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Correct?

I certainly — you know, I

certainly agree with you on that point.
Q

Okay.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The question is whether it need

be made on that basis — on that basis.

And we don't think

it does unless one is to go so far as to say that infor­
mation is no longer a permissible way to charge because,
historically —Q

There can be no question that unless Hurtado and

its successors are going to be overruled that information
is constitutionally permissible except in the federal
system to initiate a criminal proceeding.
the question here.

But that is not

The question here is holding in

custody a presumptively innocent man without a determination
of probable cause to hold, him in custody.
That is our question.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

On the basis of that information

that has been filed.
Q

Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is the question.

Whether he

is to be -- If -- but if you look at — if you look at
what is involved In the charging decision.

If you want to

21

focus on the charging decision alone., we think that there
are a number of reasons why it comports with due process
and why the bail hearing comports with due process and the
combination of those two makes it sufficient that a man be
required to stand trial on the charge against him.
The charging decision of the prosecutor has
traditionally been an executive function.
traditionally not been reviewed

It has

by the courts and by the

magistrates and, in fact, many courts have said that it is
not the kind of a decision that is really amenable to
judicial review.
The prosecutor is very much like the grand jury
and we emphasize this because the prosecutor is not
adjudicating guilt or innocence.

He is only,, by his action,

saying that a man has to stand trial and he has tradi­
tionally been permitted to do that, just as the grand jury
has, unimpeded by any procedural requirements such as those
the respondents seek here.
Secondly, while the charging decision may be made
Ex Parte, due process doesn’t always say you can’t make a
decision Ex Parte.

The arrest and search warrant situation,

which may never be reviewed, as I said before; the
determination to wiretap someone which may never be
reviewed, unless there is evidence seized which is sought
to be introduced; and the decision of the grand jury to

22
charge.
We also thinks if we focus on the due process
cases that the prosecutor is at least as independent,
probably more so, than the person permitted to make that
initial, preliminary decision in Morrissey versus Brev/er
and in Gagnon versus Scarpelli.

He is not the person that

has made the recommendation that there be a charge filed.
That is

the police officer or the citizen.

independently.

He reviews it

He is the one that has got to try it in

court, which is not a reason why he doesn't make a fair
decision, but a reason why he is very, very cautious as
to what he does.
He is the one with the limited resources that
he has got to use very sparingly and he is also the one
who has an oath of office to uphold and legal training,
which the people in Morrissey and Gagnon presumably did
not have.
Another very important point that we would like
to make is that one has to consider what happens if you
have preliminary hearings and that is something that
respondents and the courts below really never, in the
final analysis, addressed.

Is the resu.lt release on bail

or is the result release on charges?
If the result is only release on bail — if there
were a finding of no probable cause, that — in order to

23

put them in a position with those that are already out on
bond, then we still maintain that the bail hearing is
sufficient but if the result would be the

dismissal of the

charges, that is a very anomalous result and it is very
anomalous because the only one that has the right to have
his charges dismissed is the man in custody,
Whereas, the man who made bond has to stand trial
and no one is ever going to judge the sufficiency of the
evidence against him until the day of trial.
It also raises the question as to whether the
prosecutor can rebring charges if the dismissal is
entered by the magistrate.
can.

Under the federal system he

Traditionally, he can.

we just discussed he can.

Under all of those cases that

And that is as it should be

because that is an executive function.

But if the pre­

liminary hearing results in dismissal of charges, that
raises a question as to whether he can rebring the charges.
Or may he only do so by seeking grand jury
indictment, as the district court originally said?

May he

appeal the magistrate’s decision of no probable cause?
mandamus the magistrate?

Or

Or have double jeopardy and

collateral estoppel problems?
These are questions whichneither the Respondent
nor the courts below addressed and we think they didn’t
address them because logically, when one analyses what

would be the result of a no probable cause finding, the
whole system of filing information falls by the wayside and
the whole system of the prosecutor having the responsi­
bility to make the charging decision, which Respondents
say they are not attacking in this case, falls by the
wayside.
Q

So it is not the whole system of the Information

system in the 50 states because many, many states do provide
hearings for post information, do they not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Many states provide —

You are talking about the federal system and

your understanding of the Florida system.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

And there are about 9 or 10

other states.
Q

And a minority of the other states.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Q

That is correct.

Are these adversary hearings?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The hearings that Respondents are

seeking would be adversary hearings.
Q

I understand that.

1 am asking about the other

states that you mentioned.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think that in some states there

are nominal adversary hearings but, like the federal system,
the evidence may be based on hearsay, so it may be that the
police officer gets on the stand and says, "I have talked

25
;o

a witness and this is what he told me,': and the

lagistrate, on that basis, after cross-examination of that
police officer, determines probable cause.

A portion of

our brief, of course, goes to what the court — what kinds
of procedi es we suggest the Court ought to impose, if the
Court

err to require a preliminary determination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD R. MELLON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MELLON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Whatever the practice was at the time this
litigation commenced, that is, the holding for an inordinate
amount of time a suspect in jail prior to bringing him

—•

the question was raised earlier to the Solicitor General —
before a magistrate could not recur in Florida under the
present rules.
The counsel for the Respondent in his main brief,
as part of his Appendix,attached Florida’s current rule
concerning the filing of informations and the so-called
"96 hour requirement."
In

Florida at the present time a person is

ax-rested and within 24 hours after arrest must be brought
before a magistrate for a so-called "first appearance
hearing."

This is true throughout Florida by Florida’s

23
rules.
Q

What Is the purpose of that hearing?
MR. MELLON:

That is to advise him of his

constitutional rights , his right ot counsel, the right
to be provided with counsel, be he indigent and to
determine his bail.
Q

So that is very close to being equivalent with

the federal first appearance, is it?
MR. MELLON:

It is — it is modeled after the

federal rule, in effect.
Q

Right.
MR. MELLON:

In Dade County, which was the

specific area of Florida with which we are concerned since
the litigation arose out of there where the Respondents
were incarcerated, presently there are, during weekdays,
as many as four sittings of the magistrate courts on the —
for initial appearance purposes,
On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, the magis­
trate sits so that there is not any inordinate delay.

The

rule is followed very strictly as to that first appearance.
v
■ The rule, the 96 hour rule governing the filing
of informations in Florida provides that in the effect of
the 96 hours is to run after the first appearance hearing,
in the event an information is not filed within that 96
hour period, by operation of the rule, the suspect must be

29
released on his own recognizance.

This would not, of

course, allow the situation to, as I indicated earlier, to
recur in connection with the Respondents in this case where
they, to be charged with a -- arrested and incarcerated in
a Florida jail today.
96 hours.

The information would be filed within

And they would be given their liberty on their

own recognizance, pending the filing of that information
should it not be filed vrithin that period.
We subscribe completely to the

Solicitor

General’s position that the charging function belongs to the
executive, that is, to the prosecutor.
We subscribe to the position that was taken by
the American Bar Foundation in this connection.
In Frank Miller's work on prosecution, the
decision to charge a suspect with the crime, it was found
that in their survey of the states, and the specific states
that they used as laboratories for their total purpose,
that the prosecutor in most instances need not be given
the sanction of a rule to look

for — in Florida, my point

is that in Florida, the court, the Supreme Court of Florida
has indicated that in filing an information a prosecutor
should look, not to see if there would be probable cause,
but to determine if there is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.
In the Frank Miller-edited study, supervised study

by the American

Bar Foundations this was found, in fact,

to be the case generally in the United States.

The

pi*osecutor will not file a case generally, based on mere
probable cause.
He does this for a variety of reasons.
got limited resources.

He has

He has a tremendously large caseload,

many crimes more serious than other crimes, obviously.
He cannot, based on probable cause, merely file
informations in all cases so that he is looking to see if
there will be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and operating,
it is possible for a prosecutor to, in effect, compart­
mentalize.

That is, to make

a very objective deter­

mination in a given case as to whether or not the charge
and thereafter, once the charging decision has been made
and an information to file, to become an advocate in the
case.
We submit that this has been the historical
American practice and it continues to date in the States.
Q

Your argument wouldn't take you so far as to

conclude that it would be constitutional to let a
prosecutor determine whether a man Is guilty and then just
have the judge decide how long he is going to spend in
prison, would it?
MR. MELLON:

I think that would be flying in the

face of the system, Mr. Justice gtewart.

31
Q

But your argument Is

that the prosecutor

determines that there is sufficient evidence to find him
guilty,
MR. MELLON:
Q

Well —■

And, therefore, he can be held in custody without

any further determination.
MR. MELLON:

The thrust of my argument is,

Mr. Justice Stewart, is that he looks to see what kind of
a case he has.

He doesn’t make the determination

He hopes to see if he can get past the directed

verdict or the motion for the judgment of acquittal.

But

it is not he. the prosecutor, who is making that guilt
determination.

He is not usurping the function of the

petit jury in that case.
Q

It is your position, however, that that

determination is constitutionally sufficient to hold the
person in jail.
MR. MELLON:

I an saying, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that there is great pains taken by the average American
prosecutor.

Not since the court of appeals decision?
MR. MELLON:

The judicial article of the Florida

Constitution urns amended, not as a result of this par­
ticular litigation, your Honor.
Q

My question was, was it done

after, before or

after the court of appeals decision?
MR. MELLON:

The litigation was pending while

the constitutional amendment was effected in Florida.

The

rules, in direct answer to your question, the rules and
their relevance to this litigation were amended during the
time this lawsuit was pending, yes, sir.
Q

Was it argued before the court of appeals?
Well, the question is,

was

the court of

appeals given an opportunity to consider it before this
case?
MR. MELLON:

Mr. Justice Marshall, there was a

remand by the Fifth Circuit to the district court for
findings of fact in view of the new rules.
Q

That? s right.

33
MR. MELLON:
Q

That is what I was trying to get to.
MR. MELLON:

Q

Yes.

Yes, sir.

And so, as it stands now, you want us to say that

the prosecutor is a detached person?
MR. MELLON:

I argued that back in March, your

Honor and I got the same response from you at that time and
I apparently have not been any more persuasive this
morning.
However, I do submit to this Court that it is
possible for the prosecutor in America, not only in Florida,
to act in an objective fashion prior to the commencing of
a proceeding.
Q

I assumed that was a build-up for what

you

argued before.
MR. MELLON:

I have attempted to buttress it since

then, your Honor.
There is a speedy bail determination made in
Florida and, of course, Florida is certainly among the
leading states as far as speedy trials are concerned.

So

that vie do have an enterely different situation than
existed at the time this litigation was commenced and we
believe this Court should make its determination in view
of the —
Q

Who are the Plaintiffs in this action?

34
MR. MELLON:
Q

Who are the —

Who were or —
MR. MELLON:

They were a group of four who were

incarcerated in the Dade County jail awaiting trial on
informations which had been filed.
Q

Are any of them still held in jail?
MR. MELLON:

Your Honor, to the best of ray

recollection, they have all been tried and convicted and
are either — served their time or are serving time in the
state correctional system in Florida.
Q

Well, have there been any substitutions of any

other named plaintiffs in the case?
MR. MELLON:

No.

The action was commenced as a

class action, your Honor.
Q

But do any of the named plaintiffs still have any

case or controversy with —
MR. MELLON:

Not to my knowledge, no,your Honor.

All that litigation has been concluded.
Q

Would you suggest there is still a case or

controversy that we must decide in this?
MR. MELLON:

We've taken —- we took the position

at oral argument that there wasn't, your Honor.
Q

Well, do you still -MR. MELLON:

Q

We still adhere to that position.

That it was not?

35
MR. MELLON:
Q

That there was none.

MR. MELLON:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Marky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND L. MARKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FLORIDA, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. MARKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In response to the last question, we feel that
Preiser versus Rodriguez was, in fact, violated in this
case in that it was a declaratory decree rather than one
of habeas and that this has not really been answered by
counsel.
They say that this could have been treated as a
habeas by district court and it would have complied with
Preiser to which my response is, they did not request
discharge from custody and that be the end of the matter.
They went beyond.

They sought declaratory relief,

injunctive relief which raises the problem that Florida is
most concerned with and that is, the evil that brought about
this lawsuit was the delay in filing informations and the

36
failure to bring before a magistrate without unnecessary
delay.
In Florida, it was under one statute, Section 901,
one of the Florida statutes.

We -- our office, the

Attorney General’s office, kept getting complaints from
our supreme court as to why don’t you bring these people
before a magistrate?

To which we responded that it all

had to be done at one time and we couldn’t do it all at
one time, at that initial appearance.
Q

But that initial appearance was not to determine

probable cause to hold in custody.
MR. MARKY:

No.

Your Honor, not Section 90101.

Contemplated bringing him before the magistrate and holding
a preliminary nearing at once.
Q

To determine what?
MR. MARKY:

The preliminary hearing would be to

determine this probable cause situation.
Nov;, because 'we couldn't do it at once, we weren't
doing it at all and getting away with it to the detriment
of the criminal justice system.

It was at that point that

I presented to my state supreme court the option of
separating them to where there would be a time gap and they,
in fact, did this, your Honor, c.onying, essentially, Rule 5
with the exception that because we can charge by infor­
mations, we exempted it, our theory being that an

37
information is as an indictment.
Q

Tantamount to an indictment.
MR. MARKY:

Yes, your Honor and when we look at

the complaints lodged by the Respondents in this case, it
becomes clear what they are after, and it is not just
information.

Their complaint is not the good faith of the

prosecutor, not the reliability of the prosecutor.

Indeed,

their complaint is that it is secret, that they are denied
cross-examination, confrontation, the right to bring
evidence and the right to have a judicial determination.
Well, I insist that if that is the evil of which
they complain, it exists as to grand jury indictments
also and I would say, I dorit agree with the Solicitor
General and I do agree with the Respondents that if you
have to have a preliminary hearing, under due process or
Fourth Amendment, I don’t know which one it would come from,
but if either, then Rule 3 would be unconstitutional as it
pertains to misdemeanors.
I can't believe that we can say, well, on
misdemeanors, who have committed no major faction against
the public good, must sit in a jail without a hearing but,
somehow, if it is a felony, he — he gets it.

That shocks

me because the inside of the jail looks like to all people
regardless of the charge.
So I think where we have challenge before this

33
Court today Is whether there must be a hearing -- and I
mean more than a probable cause hearing in the sense of a
warrant — but a full-fledged hearing much as the final
hearing in a parole revocation.
Q

Well, but you don’t even have a probable cause

hearing in the sense of a warrant.
MR. MARKY:
Q

You don't even have that.
MR. MARKY:

Q

No, we don't, your Honor.

Because, again —

So let's take one step at a time.
MR. MARKY:

I do understand that and I — and

your Honor is absolutely correct and I do it on the premise
the same reason this Court found that an indictment
return satisfies Fourth Amendment.

And I find that

uniquely interesting to our prosecutorial scheme.
Now, if we say that we must have it across the
board, I understand.

I understand.

I'll go home and lick

my wounds and somehow we'll have to fashion a criminal
justice system designed to accommodate it, but —
Q

Many, many states have.
MR. MARKY:

Yes, your Honor*.

I understand.

And

I understand that there is a proposed constitutional
amendment to do away with indictments in the federal
system which would bring about informations and they would
be back into the same boat and I see there is very little

39
advantage to be gained.
In my main brief, I took the position that the
total system should be looked at and I still think that.

I

would not be adverse, for example, your Honor, if you said,
we must, if the man is in custody, at that bail hearing,
open It up broad enough to encompass a somewhat ex parte
or very, very brief hearing on that issue.
In other words, we think of bail tradition as
not including the weight of the evidence.

Well, if we are

going to changethe whole system, perhaps we ought not be so
quick to think of the black or the white, but perhaps, some
Intermediate position of saying, okay, you are not going to
have that requirement, but you must open your bail to take
in this inquiry.
In relationship to this, your Honor, counsel says
they are concerned with pretrial liberty.

If they are

concerned with pretrial liberty, why do they continue to
now insist -— and they do it on page 11 of their supple­
mental brief —• that it pertains whether you are in bail,
out on bail or not.
The court of appeals reversed that portion of the
district court's order that this-preliminary hearing existed
as to a bail indicti and they insist again here, your Honor.
I tell you, they are after something akin to
Ash versus Swenson, full hearing, judicial magistrate,

40

finding, no probable cause and they come to us and say,
well, if there is not even probable cause, how can you
pretend to put this man on trial?
Q

Well, if you are out on bail, you have been

deprived of your property.
MR. MARKY:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

You have either had to put up your own money or

get somebody to put it up for you and paid him money to
do it.
MR. MARKY:

But then, your Honor, it’s a differ­

ent level of —
Q

Well, if we are talking about due process, we

are on the same level.
MR. MARKEY:
Q

I think —

Liberty or property.
MR. MARK:

Well, Argerslnger made the distinction

of property because if the man is only fined, merely fined,
as opposed to being denied his liberty, counsel is not
required, so, your Honor, there is a difference.

If we

are talking about perhaps the loss of his income as
opposed to the loss of his custody and I insist, I don't
know what counsel's next step will be, but I know that he
says, as an alternative we can indict.

Whether, that

procedure would meet the demands of their due process will
have to wait another day.

Well, it is going to be

41
tomorrow if you give it to the misdemeanants and the felons
under an information, but you defer as to an indictment.
I say it is all here today.
Q

It is all now.

Well, you started out, when you got up to talk

about the question that was asked about —
MR. MARKY:
Q

I'm sorry.

And you have never gotten back to it.

about that?

Well, how

Is there anybody here who has an existing

controversy with the State' of Florida?
MR. MARKY:
Q

I don’t think so.

Any of the named Plaintiffs?
MR. MARKY:

I do not believe so because these

individuals were pursued through the system under the old
rules that don’t eve-n exist any more and there are none that
continued.

In fact, the remand should have not even gotten

into the declaratory relief because there was no person who
could complain of their injury

that was in the Plaintiffs'

class.
Q

Then these

named plaintiffs have been convicted,

is that it?
MR. MARKY:
Q

Yes.

Yes.

And they either have served or they are serving

their time?
MR. MARKY:

Yes, you see, I am disturbed because

the Florida’s new rules, which was an experiment, before

42
they were even put into operation, were cut up and
decided.

Counsel cites statistics about his preliminary

hearing produced a great result.
that order was stayed.

His preliminary hearing,

The new results, the new statistical

information, comes from our new rules, patterned after
the trial.

So the enhancement of the criminal justice

system in Florida is not the product of the due process
hearing.
Q

I take it also that,at least before the State

of Florida took the position, that the federal court
should not have intervened at all, that pending criminal
prosecutions, that the federal court shouldn’t —
MR. MARKY:
Q

Younger versus Harris, and ■—

And you still press that?
MR. MARKY:

Well, your Honor, I would like a

ruling on the merits because Florida is concerned about
where we go from here.
Q

So you are waiving your Younger against Harris,

are you not?
MR. MARKY:

I can’t waive Younger versus Harris,

your Honor.
Q

Well, you can’t have it both x-/ays.
MR. MARKY:

Then I would insist that -— that there

is no case or controversy.

companion cases.
Q

Yes, but this —

Now you are talking about something else.
MR. MARKY:

On your standing issue, I think, in

Doe, there was standing.

She had standing at that time.

These people did not have standing,
Q

The members of the class had standing because —
MR. MARKY:

Right, members of the class had

standing.
Q

Even though she had her baby or had her abortion
MR. MARKY:

We don’t have anybody in any class

represented by —
Q

You mean to tell me, there is nobody in jail in

the whole

State of Florida?
MR., MARKY:

I said, no members of that class are

with the plaintiffs also.
Q

You mean, there is nobody in jail in the whole

State of Florida against whom only an information has
been filed?
MR. MARKY:

None of the named Plaintiffs that

include -- No, I don’t know what I mean, your Honor.

your pardon.
Excuse me.

Mr. Rogow.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP RESPONDENTS
MR. ROGOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think I should begin with the question of
mootness suggested by Mr. Justice White.

Our position

here is that -—
Q

I didn't suggest it.
MR. ROGOW:

I just asked about it.

Yes, sir.

This is a capable-of-repetition-yet-evadingreview situation.
Q

That is your only answer to it, isn't it?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, it is.

This case must be viewed —
Q

What about the case of Indiana Employment

Commission against Burney?
MR, ROGOW:

Burney versus Indiana, your Honor,

dealt xtfith a situation which we think really was not a
capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review case.
We have a class action here, as there was in
Burney, but we are not hinging our argument upon the class
action aspect.

45
In Burney, there might very well have been an
opportunity for a woman who is denied unemployment security
to come to this Court seeking those benefits because she
had been denied them without a prior hearing.

So it would

not be capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review.

It could

reoccur.

There could be a person who would have been

Injured.

So Burney does not bar us in any way.
But I think

another point

regarding Burney is

that in Burney, the person could be made whole.

If

unemployment benefits xvere taken.» they could be given back,
if It was finally determined that she was entitled to them.
But when liberty is taken, there is no way to
make a person whole except to return that liberty and this
is a much more compelling kind of example of a person who
Is being deprived in the ability of the criminal process
and unless this Court finds that it is capable-of-repetitionyet-evading'-review — which, of course, we suggest it is,
there would be no way ever to challenge that taking
because we do not seek to overturn otherwise valid
convictions.

We are not saying he can’t have a fair trial

without a preliminary hearing.

Only In chat short period

of time between arrest and trial, there must be some
determination of probable cause made.
Q

VJould you say that Florida could meet all here

problems If — I take it they couldn’t —■ if Florida said

46
unless there is a preliminary hearing, a person will be
automatically granted bail pending trial?
MR. ROGOW:

That would not meet all our problems.

It might meet the problem in this case because this case
focuses on people in custody.

There might be a question

then raised* though, whether or not the person who was
released and whose custody is then conditional might, too,
have an argument that he needs a due process hearing.

But

that is another case.
Q

Authority to be put on trial?
MR. ROGOV/:

Yes, sir, but that is just another

case.
Q

Before his property can be taken away from him.
MR. ROGOW:

Q

Yes, sir.

Well, I take it that Florida,then, would solve

the entire problem if they proceeded against persons just
by summons, if an information is filed, they just issued
a summons and said we are going to put you on trial on a
certain date.

Mow you can either show up or you don’t

want to, but we are going to put you on trial.
MR. ROGOW:

In the context of this case, there

would not be the same due process kind of -Q

There would be no bail.

There would be no

flowing from the fact that they did not appear for
They then would lose their liberty and be in

violation
Q

I think there still would be a bit of

of a court order.

That is one step removed from

On that basis, you could never try anybody.

Q

ThatJ s right.

Q

Except twice.
MR. ROGOVJ:

No, sir.

No, sir.

I am not saying,

by the way, that there must be a hearing in that summons
case or that there must be hearings for the person who is
released on bail.

That is just another question.

The

balancing, the due process balancing test to be used then
would be different than that which is used here.
Here we are dealing with the taking of absolute
liberty from people who are presumed to be innocent and our
cases focuses only upon that taking and we think that the
recent due process decisions of this Court must be viewed
as a background for deciding this case.
Q

What relief did you want when you filed your

case?
HR. ROGOV/:

A preliminary hearing in state court.

That is all.
Q

Or what?
HR. ROGOV/:

is state court

Or nothing.

A preliminary hearing

48
Q

Well, you wanted release unless they dids

didn't you?
MR. ROGOW:
your Honor.

We did not ask to release In no way,

We — if they did not provide the preliminary

hearing in state court, perhaps then you are getting into
a contempt situation with the state judges not folloxving
the federal court order, but we never sought release from
the federal courts.

We asked the federal court to order

that preliminary hearings be provided in the state process.
If they were provided and if there were no probable cause,
and a state judge discharged the person, that would be the
end of the prosecution.
But the federal courts are not interfering in
any way, neither to release a person from custody nor to
interfere with pending state court prosecutions.
Q

And you think the new rule does not take care

of you?
MR. ROGOV/:

It does nothing, your Honor.

situation in Florida is exactly the same.

The

The state

attorney can obviate the right to a preliminary hearing
by filing an information.

If there is a preliminary

hearing held, he can overturn the preliminary hearing by
filing an information.
The information process operates only at the
tolerance of the state attorney.

The state attorney is the

49
key to this case,

He has the unfettered discretion to

determine if a person is going to be held in custody
pending trial.
Q

What is — it's a limited time.

How about the

92 hours?
MR. ROGOW:
96 hours.

He must file an information within

Actually, it is five days, because 96 hours runs

after the initial appearance, which is 24 hours.
Q

Well, how about bail?

He has to have a hearing

MR. ROGOV/:
hearing.

Yes, sir.

There would be a bail

But the bail hearing, if a person is not released

from custody on bail, as were not the Plaintiffs in this
case, the bail hearing is meaningless.

Certainly, there

is an opportunity to test probable cause.
The real question, I think, may even be asked --Q

You lost me some place.

If in 92 hours he gets

a bail hearing and he is let out on bail, that is
different.

He would not have the situation that we present

to the Court today.
If the person cannot make bail, then we do come
into the situation we have in the Court today and also I
may add that Pugh, for instance —
Q

Wouldn’t that be the same with an indictment?
MR. ROGOtl:

an indictment.

Yes, sir, it would be the same with

But this case does not focus at all upon

indictment.
I should add, regarding the bail situation,
Mr. Justice Marshall, Pugh, and the class he represents,
not only are denied preliminary hearings by an information,
they are denied bail because in the Florida system, when a
person is charged with an offense which carries with it the
punishment of life imprisonment, the information denies
him. a preliminary hearing and it denies him the right to
bail.

He is not entitled to bail unless he shows that the

proof of guilt is not evident nor the presumption great.
So the burden shifts to him, in effect, to have to
show no probable cause.

It is certainly a radical rever­

sal of what we usually assume the burden to be.
Q

That is a very common provision.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, I think it is, but it just

underlines the fact that the bail hearing is no answer at

51
all for a person charged with this kind of offense.
Q

Wells when you say a radical reversal, from

what my understanding is, it is certainly not a radical
departure from the almost literal statutory language in
many states when you do have what is formerly a capital
offense and is now a life imprisonment offense.
HR. ROGOW:

No, sir.

It is only a radical

departure from the arguments advanced that due process is
met in any way by the bail hearing.

The burden is

completely shifted in those capital offense bail hearings.
When one looks at the recent due process
decisions —
Q

Mr. Rogov;?
MR. ROGOW:

Q

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell?

Before you p;o on, Mr. Rogow, you asked for a

judicial hearing.

Will you describe exactly what you

contemplate by judicial hearing?
Your brief refers to the right to counsel, to the
right to cross-examination.

Would it also include the right

to call witnesses by the party being held?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, it would.

The Florida rule

already provides for that in its preliminary hearing rule.
Q

Right.

I am speaking now as to what you consider

the Constitution requires.
MR. ROGOW:

We would look to a case like

52
Morrissey versus Brewer, talking about the preliminary
probable cause hearing in the parole revocation situation,
the opportunity to present evidence, the opportunity to
have the decision made by a neutral, detached person which
would be a judge, we submit in this ca.se and the opportunity
to confront and cross-examine.
The question of the right to counsel has been
decided in Coleman versus Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 and there
would be a right to counsel.
Q

But in Morrissey there was no right to counsel.
MR. ROQOWi

No, sir, there was no right to

But Morrissey was dealing with someone already

adjudicated to be guilty and sentenced by a court.

Here

we are dealing with presumably Innocent people and their
liberty being taken for the very first time and being placed
in jail.
Q

Well, there are at least two areas where you

don't get anything like this before your liberty is taken
away.

One is before a grand jury.

You don't even have a

right to appear and you don't have a right to counsel.
don't have a right to cross-examine.
right to anything.

You

You don't have a

And yet, on indictment by a grand jury

a person is held in custody subject to making bail prior to
trial,
Also, upon an arrest, under an arrest warrant

53
issued by a magistrate, upon probable cause, you stay in
jail without any such rights as you are talking about of
counsel or of adversary hearing of any kind or to present
evidence.

That is all Ex Parte.
Nov/, how many have distinguished those situations,

which are very well-settled in our lav/, at least
historically.
MR. ROGOW:

The indictment situation was dis­

tinguished by saying that in order to make the argument
we are making towards indictments, one would have to do
away with the historic respect which exists for the indict­
ment process and the fact that independent people from the
community are making the determination.
Now, that respect may no longer be proper today
but I can’t say that.

That can’t be said unless it is said

upon a proper record that proves that point.

This case

certainly may spawn litigation directed to that question,
but this case does not come anywhere near, presenting that
question.
As to the person who is —
Q

Well, I suggest that it does come quits near

presenting that question.
MR. ROGOW:

To the extent that a decision of this

Court may have a future impact upon a factual situation
making that same argument towards indictment, it would

54
come close but I don't think the Court can accept3 nor
do we accept the characterization made by the government —
made by the attorney for the State of Florida that this
Court should accept the invitation to now say that indict­
ments require preliminary hearings afterwards.

It just

doesn’t focus upon that issue.
Q

But — excuse me.

I don't think he had finished

ans;tfering.
MR. ROC-OW:
arrest warrant.

But as to the person held upon the

Wes of course9 are not saying that a per­

son must be granted a hearing prior to the issuance of the
arrest warrant.

To say that would be to say that you

should invite a person in for his preliminary hearing to
say if he is going to be arrested.

That, of course,

would not be very workable.
Once jurisdiction has been asserted and the
court may then try the person because they have the body
of the person before it, there is nothing being lost by
providing a preliminary hearing after the arrest warrant
has been issued and a person has been taken into custody.
So we submit that in that situation we are
asking for a due process -Q

Even after there has been a determination by

a neutral magistrate of probable cause to arrest and hold
somebody in custody under a warrant that he has issued?

55
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, because it is an Ex Parte,

non-adversary —
Q

I know and so is a grand jury indictment an Ex

Parte proceedings.
MR. ROGOV/:
Q

I understand that.

They both are and they both

have been accepted

historically as sufficient grounds for holding people in
jail prior to trial.
MR. ROGOW:
Q

You would agree with that?
I would.

I would.

So your response to Justice Stewards question

about the grand jury says it is distinguishable because
there you have 23 presumably representatives of the
community and then not people who are prosecuted.

I can

see how that would satisfy the neutral magistrate require­
ment, but you ar asking not just for a neutral magistrate,
but for the right to counsel, the rip;ht to be present, the
right to present evidence.
None of those are distinguishable in a grand jury
situation.
MR. ROGOW:

They are not and all I can say is,

that the historical respect given to the grand jury process
makes it a much different situation.
As I say, I am not disagreeing with you,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that there is not a similarity, an
argument that could be made based upon ours attacking the

56
grand jury process too, but I am reminded historically of
the fact that when John Peter Zenger was sought to be
prosecuted by the Crown , I think I mentioned this last time
in my original argument, twice the Crown sought to indict
him and twice

the grand jury refused to indict him and

finally the Crown proceeded against him by information
and prosecuted him.
All I am saying is, is that if that historical
respect is no longer here, then perhaps what I say here
today may have equal

application to a grand jury case but

it is not — it is just not the case before the Court today.

Mr. Rogow, does Florida allow pretrial

that he should not have been In there in the first place.
When one views this case against the conditionallyheld property and conditionally-held liberty which was at
issue in Morrissey! Gagnon, Fuentes, Mitphell versus W. T.
Grant and Sniadach, and one recognizes that in those cases
the court held that there must be a preliminary hearing
before or shortly after a conditionally-held liberty or
property was taken, then we submit that dealing here with
absolute liberty, it must be clear that there must be a
preliminary hearing shortly after the absolute right to
liberty is being taken and that hearing includes the right
to be heard, to confront and cross-examine and have a
neutral and detached person make the decision.
It is against that background, the absolute
right to liberty of a presumably innocent person and the
prior due process decions of the Court, that I think we
then have to judge the government’s arguments, the
information process, the prosecutorial screening process.
Even if a prosecutor is disinclined to file a
bad charge, assuming that to be true, he can only file what
he gets from the police officer or the complaining party
and all he gets is one side of the case.

He hears what

the police officer tells him and the record in this case
reflects that exactly, at page 45, I believe, in the
Appendix, an assistant state attorney evaluates the

58
evidence given to him by a prosecutor and then determines
xvhether or not he is going to file an information.

It is

not even due process -Q

Aren't there instances where the prosecutor and

the police investigate independently the information that is
given to them?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, they do and there are

situations —
Q

Well, I thought you said it was just what the

police said.
MR. ROGOW:

In most cases.

In most mine-run

offenses, it is that.

You assume that.

Yes, a police officer coming in,

MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, I assume it from my

But I think that what you have said,

Mr. Justice Marshall, there are situations in which a
prosecutor investigates without police officers and begins
a whole inquiry which then results in his filing of the
charge.
Q

There is no way one can say a prosecutor —
Well, aren't there cases where he investigates

and decides not to file a charge?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, there are.

And your point., then5 is what?
MR. ROGOW:

My point then is that he still,

under our argument, may do that.
prosecute a charge, that is fine.

If he decides not to
If he hears a police

officer’s story or goes and checks it with another person,
say, and says, this case is so weak and he decides not to
prosecute, we would not interfere with that at all, nor
would the decision that we seek interfere with that at all.
But when he hears both of those stories, it is
still a one-sided story.
Q

You’ve got to upset a whole lot of law to say you

can make a prosecutor prosecute when he doesn’t want to.
MR. ROGOW:
Q

We are not seeking that, Mr. Justice.

You could wreck all of it.
MR. ROGOW:

Mr. Justice Marshall.

We are not seeking that in any way,
We are not saying that he cannot

prosecute or that he must prosecute.

We are saying that

when he decides that he is going to charge and files that
information, he has done it in an Ex Parte, nonadversarial,
one-sided kind of a fashion and all we are saying is, is
that this undermines this whole argument.
Q

You do contemplate a hearing that would require

the weighing of evidence, then, from decisions on
credibility?
MR. ROGOW:

Certainly.

60
Q

And it just isn’t enough if the

state presents

sworn testimony which, taken alone, would be sufficient to
amount to probable cause?
MR. ROGOW:
Q

No, sir.

No, sir.

You do — you insist that before the person can

be held that the judge must be exposed to any contrary
evidence and decide and weigh the evidence and, perhaps,
decide who might be lying or who might not be lying.
MR. ROGOW:

The only difficulty I have with that

question is, when you say, "Before the person can be held."
We are saying he can be held for a short time because —
Q

Well, I understand that but he can’t be held

very long.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

And then shortly after

that, there must be that kind of adversarial hearing.

So it is a sort of a mini —- it is a mini trial

when the prosecutor files —

Yes, in Florida he can be held 90

it is a 60-day limit for both felonies and misdemeanors.

system, discovery of state’s evidence is meaningless
because he could get that anyway, but in terms of —

Because why should you have to post bail if,

Indeed, there is no probable cause to hold you for trial?
But as a practical matter, bail hearings do come
first.

People do secure their release from custody.

This

case only focuses upon those who have been unfortunate
enough not to be able to secure their release from custody.
q

Mr. Rogow, I think you just said that under the

present rules one may be confined 90 or l80 days?

How is

that?
MR. ROGOW:

90 days for misdemeanors -— under the

Florida speedy trial rule, Mr. Justice Brennan, one must
be tried within 90 days of arrest in a misdemeanor case or
180 days of arrest in a felony case.

If a demand is made,

then the time Is shortened to 60 days from the date of the
demand.
Q

But the 96-hour rule, I gather, goes only to

whether he shall be released on ball and if he Is not, then
he may be confined up to 90 days?
MR. ROGOW:

No, the 24-hour rule deals with the

65
initial appearance, which would be a determination of bailj
96 hours after the 2k hours would be his right to a pre­
liminary hearing, which could be done away with if the
information is filed.
Q

I see.

In other words, even if —

I see.

And then, if the information is

filed, then he is confined up to 90 days or 180, unless
he demands a speedy trial?
MR. ROGOV/:
Q

Yes, sir.

And then he must be tried within 60 days.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, from the date of the

demand,
I think that one other thing that must be
considered is this argument regarding Morrissey versus
Brewer and the fact that the state attorney is playing the

same role

as the other parole officer.
The state attorney, in his office, after they

determine probable cause, are an integral part of the
prosecutorial scheme.

They are then committed to trans­

posing that probable cause into guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt.

There is no way that one can equate them to the

other parole officer

who does not then become an advocate

after he determines there is probable cause to hold this
person for final parole revocation proceedings.
The other parole officer nor the one who initiated
the process are

in the same kind of situation as a state

66
attorney is, who is an advocate and whose job is to
convince this person.
The government

has said, in its brief, that

misdemeanants should be excluded from any preliminary
hearing requirements.
The State of Florida seems to agree with us that
if there is a right to a preliminary hearing, a person held
in jail, be he held upon a misdemeanor or a felony, is
using the same right to absolute liberty and both should
be provided preliminary hearings.
And I think it is interesting to note that in the
District of Columbia, people are held in jail for over 90
days, about 14 percent, according to the Solicitor General’s
brief, about 14 percent of the incarcerated misdemeanants
who are unable to make bail, don’t get tried until sometime
after 90 days of their arrest and the Solicitor General is
saying that there is no need for those people to have a
preliminary hearing, that the information process is
sufficient.
Our position, of course, is that it is const!™
tutionally incongruous to permit those people to remain
incarcerated for 90 days but say that a felony defendant
sitting in the same jail cell would be provided a pre­
liminary hearing and Argersinger, we think, is instructive
on this and Argersinger, the court said, you can’t take away

67
a misdemeananfc’s liberty for one day absent a lawyer or
proper waiver of a lawyer after trial.
The government is suggesting you can take away
that liberty for more than 90 days without even a hearing.
Q

The U3e throughout the briefs and oral argument

in this case of the phrase "preliminary hearing" throws me
off a little bit because I think you are not contending
that there must be a hearing preliminary to any custody
whatsoever.

Are you?

IiR. ROGOW:

No, we are not.

We are not.

I think those cases, Hurtado, Lem Woon, Ocampo3
which you alluded to before, do not need to be overruled
to come to the conclusion we ask for.
Q

Yes.

So you are asking for a hearing not pre­

liminary to any custody whatsoever?
MR. ROGOW:
Q

No.

But a hearing when?
MR. ROGOW:

Q

Are you?

Shortly after custody has been taken

And by shortly you mean?
MR. ROGOW:

Well, the Fifth Circuit seemed to

tolerate a four to seven day time period which was the
Florida provision then —
Q

And all this time you were objecting to 96 hours
MR. ROGOW:

No, it was four to seven days where

the question was posed.

I am contending that affirmance -

Mr. Justice Brennan asked me that and I am contending
affirmance 3 although I think there is a strong argument to
be made that four to seven days is an awful long time to
have a person’s liberty being taken

wife, family, perhaps losing a job, whatever may flow from
it and, again, Argersinger is instructive there, that if

Q

away for a day.after trial, how can you —

Let me be clear, Mr. Rogow,

if within 96 hours

you must either get a preliminary hearing or —
MR. ROGOW:
Q

A hearing within 96 hours.
MR. ROGOW:

Q

A hearing.
Is that it?

Yes.

Unless that is made unnecessary because information

is filed within that period.
MR. ROGOW:
Q

Is that it?
MR. ROGOW:

Q

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Now, what is the nature of the hearing if one is

given within the 96 hours?
MR. ROGOW:

A preliminary hearing with the right

to confrontation and cross-examination and the right to
present evidence.
Q

Is there any disagreement between you and Florida

counsel?
MR. ROGOW:

I don't think there can be there

69
because the rule provides that.
Q

I see.
MR. ROGOW:

Q

But let me add that if the —

But then the information can be filed thereafter,

can it not?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

Even if the person is

discharged at that preliminary hearing, the information
can then be filed, which then puts the person back in
custody and overrules the magisterial determination.
Q

And in that event, the preliminary hearing will

have had no effect.
MR. ROGOW:

None at all.

None at all.

The

prosecutor absolutely controls the process.
Q

Well, vrhat is happening in practice, under that

rule?
MR. ROGOW:

In practice, the prosecuting attorney

generally regards the determination made by the magistrate
as a final binding one and —
Q

And doesn’t, in fact, later file an information?
MR. ROGOW:

Well, sir, in some cases he does, but

generally , he does not.
Q

Well, does he often short-circuit the preliminary

hearing or most of the time?
MR. ROGOW:

In Dade County, as I understand it,

about 15 percent of the time he short-circuits the

TO
preliminary hearing.

Throughout the state, it is done much

more often.
What happened, of course, in this case is after
the district court decision, the local judiciary responded
by providing a preliminary hearing system with the same
defect that the state attorney could obviate it, but
because it does work so well, because we do have a reduction
in the felony court caseload, it has been found that it is
an efficient way to administer criminal justice in Dade
County.
Q

And what is your argument that Younger against

Harris has no application here or is no problem to you?
MR. ROGOV/:

Our answer is this.

First of all,

this case did not seek to interfere in any way
pending state court prosecutions.

with the

It did not stifle the

pending state court prosecutions.
Nov;, all it means to say is that you must have a
preliminary hearing.

If a state judge decided there was no

probable cause, that would then end the case, but

it would

be a state judge’s determination.

Sc there is no interthe
ference, as is witnessed in this case because/people were
obviously tried in this case.
Our fallback argument is that even if Younger is
applicable — and we strongly submit it is not —- this is an

exception to the Younger doctrine.

You have irreparable

71
injurys the loss of liberty.

You have no way of raising

this in the Florida courts because the Florida law is
adamant, there is no right to a preliminary hearing, and
there is no way to effectively combat the loss of liberty
after conviction.
So, in those two ways, we submit that Younger
is no barrier.
Over a long period of time, the preliminary
hearing in the role of the judiciary in determining whether
or not a person should be held for trial has grown and it
has been recognized that this is a very important kind of
procedure and we submit that history, reason3 fairness,
which are the things that Justice Frankfurter said due
process is compounded of, we submit that history, reason
and fairness require that there be an opportunity for a
hearing subsequent to the taking of liberty by a person
held in jail upon a prosecutor’s information.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Friedman, you have a few minutes left there.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just very briefly, I want to point out again that
in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, where we
have these 6,500 misdemeanors, there are no preliminary

72
hearings on misdemeanors at all by virtue of the rules and,
in fact, most cases have begun by information.
office comes in.

The police

There is no — there is a complaint filed,

yes and the Information is filed the morning after arrest
at the initial appearance, so there is a sort of a combin­
ation of procedures.
Q

The complaint is generally filed by a police

officer but sometimes by a citizen.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In the District of Columbia, not

by a citizen.
Q

It is usually by the victim to the police officer.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

And in those cases where

the police don’t want to deal with the case or don’t feel it
is appropriate, no formal complaint as we know it is filed.
Instead, the citizen comes down to a citizens complaint
center and it is dealt with usually in a noncriminal setting.
The kind of hearing that he is talking about with
from four to seven days, we suggest, first of all, one
question that has to be addressed is whether or not hearsay
is permitted, as it is in the federal rules and we suggest
that the kinds of hearings, maybe 25 or 30 a day before a
single magistrate, really may not give as much protection
as does the determination made by the prosecutor.
We also want to suggest that one ought to
consider —

73
Q

Well, you are not talking about alternatives,

either/or, are you?

You are talking about both.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I’m talking about both.

That’s

true.
Q

So maybe it wouldn't give as much protection as

if you just had to take one or the other, but —
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

The combination —

■— presumably if you take the combination it will

give you a little more than if you had only one, wouldn't
it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, again, in the District of

Columbia at that initial judgment stage, the prosecutor
declines prosecution In 23 percent of the cases brought to
him by the police and just from my own experience, for
whatever it is worth, the amount of hours that 1 spent as
a prosecutor in conferences debating whether to charge
or not to charge or is it a close case or not, I have
great faith, which I don't expect everyone to share, in
the decision-making processes of the prosecutor and I
think it is entitled to equal dignity with the grand jury
as a matter of judgment.
Two implications that I think the — two things
that I think the Court ought to consider if it rules
against us:

One, tell us what the result of the pre­

liminary hearing is.

Is it dismissal or is it release on

74
bond?

Can the prosecutor rebring that charge and under

what circumstances?
Two, the analogy to the Fourth Amendment cases
wins out.

We suggest that the answer ought to be, and

nothing more, the filing of an affidavit with the infor­
mation, and that should satisfy the problem raised by this
case.
Thank you.
Q

By filing an affidavit where and with whom?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

With the court or the magistrate

at the time that the information is filed.

He would then

look at that affidavit, determine if there is probable
cause to support the information.

There wou3.d be no hearing,

as Mr. Rogow urges.
Q

It would be the equivalent of an application for

an arrest warrant?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Exactly.

And we think that if the

Court disagrees with us on our other points, that by analogy
to the Fourth Amendment cases, that should be enough to
satisfy the Fourth Amendment and due process, given what the
implications of the information are.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:24 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
