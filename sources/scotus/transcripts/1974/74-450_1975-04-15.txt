ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court :
Exemption three to the Freedom of Information Act
covers matters that are specifically exempted from dis­
closure by statute.
The question in this case, which is here on a writ
of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, is whether, by this provision, Congress
intended to continue in effect the large number of prior and
existing federal statutes which provided for non-disclosure
of government material on various terms and conditions
rather than, as the Court of Appeals held, is limited to
particular statutes that specify the particular material
involved and which provide a more specific standard for non­
disclosure than the public Interest.
The case involves certain documents produced by the
Federal Aviation Administration which It does pursuant to its

4
systems worthiness analysis program which I shall refer to
by its commonly-accepted acronym of SCRAP.
What these reports are, are the result of a program
that the Federal Aviation Administration conducts Involving
a detailed study and analysis of air carrier systems.

They

study —
QUESTION:

It is SWAP, not SCRAP, isn't it?

HR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, SWAP.

I

apologize.
QUESTION:

SCRAP is something else that we have had

to deal with in the past here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
SWAP.

SCRAP is another case, yes.

It involves a detailed study and analysis

of the operations and the maintenance

programs of the

carriers to ascertain whether the carriers’ own programs are
functioning properly.
The purpose of the program is to try to uncover,
before they mature, anything that might lead to an unsafe
operation.
A major aspect of this program is free and frank
discussion betx^een the team of SOA people, the SWAP team
that conducts the investigation, and the management of the
carrier.

They discuss the thing; they analyze the problem;

they point out the difficulties.
In an affidavit on file in this case that is

5
uncontroverted by Mr. Shaffer,

the Administrator of FAA,

which is set forth at pages 40 to 42 of the record, he
explains how this thing operates and the importance of the
informal, frank discussion.

He said the — this is page 40,

paragraph six, "A SWAP investigative team works in close
cooperation with airline management to find any area of
maintenance operations, management or overall performance
which needs improvement.
"The system depends upon the frank and full
disclosure of the airline."
It also points out that information investigated
includes financial and operational matters which would not
customarily be released to the public and that much of the
material is of the nature which would not be disclosed to
competitors.
and then in paragraph number 12 on page 41, he
says, "The SWAP Program operates with the understanding
between the airlines and the FAA that the information will
not be disclosed to the public."
At the end of the SWAP investigation, which may
take anywhere from two weeks to much longer and is conducted
by

teams of four or five people, a final report is made in

whicn detailed findings are made, the problems of the carrier
analyzed and recommendations are proposed.
Now, neither the report nor the informational

6
findings in it is made available to the public although,, as
Mr. Shaffer

said at page 42 of the record in his affidavit,

“The findings made by the SCRAP

team are frequently dis­

closed to the carrier management in order to enable there to
be the kind of frank discussions necessary and to enable the
carrier to take corrective action.'1
The Respondent in this case, Mr. Robertson, is
connected with the Center for the Study of Responsive Law
and is director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project.
' In the summer of 1970, this group was conducting a
study of airline safety and they requested the Federal
Aviation Administration to make available to them all of the
SWAP reports in 1969.
The Administration

refused to do this and they

filed a petition for rehearing and while the petition for
rehearing was pending, the air carrier industry, appearing
through the Air Transport Association, its trade association,
requested the

Administrator, under Section 1104 of the

Federal Aviation Act, not to disclose this material.
Section 1104, which is set out at pages three to
four of our brief, provides that, in response to a written
objection to disclosure of either information contained in
an application report or document filed with either the
Civil Aeronautics Board or the Federal Aviation Administra­
tion, and I refer in this case only to the Administration,

7
or information that the Administration has obtained pursuant
to the Act, when such a written objection is made, the
Administrator shall order the Information withheld from
public disclosure when, In his judgment, a disclosure of the
information will adversely affect the interest of the person
seeking non-disclosure and is not required in the public
interest.
The letter by which the Air Transport Association
requested the Administration to keep this information
confidential is set forth at pages 112 to 113 of the record
and in that letter, they point out that the information
which they give to the SWAP team during the Investigation
voluntarily is now required

be disclosed by any regulation

of the Federal Aviation Administration and they said, "If
pub .Lie disclosure of the SWAP reports were made, the interest
of aviation safety would be in danger of being subordinated
:m some degree to legal considerations in the presentation
of information to the FAA.”
They also pointed out that the present informal
practice of frank and free discussion that encourages a
opirit oi openness on the part of ARI management, which is
vital to the promotion of aviation safety.
On the basis following thi3 submission, the
Administrator made a determination under Section 1104, which
is set forth at page 115 of the record, deciding not to make

8
public the SWAP reports.

He made the determination in the

language of the statute that disclosure of the information
in the reports would adversely affect the interest of the
airline being investigated and is not required in the public
interest.
Following this determination, the FAA denied
reconsideration of the Respondents 8 request for the SWAP
reports.

The suit was brought.

The District Court ordered

disclosure of the SWAP reports and a divided Court of
Appeals affirmed.
The majority held two things.

First, it held that

the reference to Section 1104, the material specifically
exempted from disclosure by statute, was only applicable
if the statute itself specified the documents or categories
of documents it authorizes to be

withheld and it said that

1104 didn't come within this because it didn’t specify any
particular class of documents.
Secondly, it said that the standard in Section 1104
of the public interest was not a specific exemption by
statute within the meaning of Exemption three.
There was a dissenting opinion by Judge Robb in
which he referred to the legislative history which I will
.
,
there is
allude to shortly, pointing out that / strong Congressional
intent in Exemption three to continue the effectiveness of
this large number of statutes and he said he didn't beliove

9
in the light of that that Exemption three could be viewed
as repealing by implication the specific provisions of
Section 1104.
Now, the Freedom of Information Act was enacted
because of dissatisfaction with the way the old Public
Information section of the Administrative Procedure Act had
worked.
There was considerable feeling in Congress and
elsewhere that under this statute, the public was not being
furnished with the information it was entitled to receive
and one serious flaw, as this Court pointed out In its
Mink opinion two terms ago, was one of the provisions of
that statute which permitted to the withholding from
disclosure of material relating to any function of the United
States requiring secrecy in the public interest.
And It was felt that this standard, which was a
general standard covering the whole gamut of Government
operations, just

didn’t provlde ^ guldellnes that

Government officials could easily say, we think it is not
in the public interest to disclose it and keep

secret.

The respnse Congress gave in the Freedom of
Information Act was generally — generally to open up all
identifiable Government records to disclosure but subject
to nine specific exemptions and of course, the nine specific
exemptions dealing with various areas reflected a

10
recognition that the effective operation of Government
requires, in some instances, that material be kept confi­
dential in order to permit the Government to function pro­
perly .
QUESTION:

We have here only Exemption three under

consideration.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Only Exemption three, Mr. Justice.

And if you should not prevail on that

one, you still may win your case under one or the other of
the exemptions.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We may, Mr. Justice, because the

exemptions sometimes overlap but we think on this issue, we
think that we are entitled to prevail under Exemption six.
Now, of the nine exemptions that Congress created,
seven of them contain their own standards.
however, do not.

Two of them,

Exemption three and Exemption one, which

this Court had before it in che Mink case which referred to
matter specifically required by Executive order to be kept
confidential.
T3ie two provisions — Exemption three and Exemption
one in effect incorporate by reference other standards of
confidentiality which reflected in the one case an Executive
order and in the other case a statute.
Now, at the time that the Freedom of Information
Act was enacted in 1966, there were in existence a large

11
number of Government statutes.

The number is uncertain.

There is some reference in the legislative history to 80,
78, almost 100.
But these are all statutes in which Congress,
specifically dealing with a particular problem, had concluded
that Government information should be kept confidential.
The terms of these statutes varied.

In some

instances, they provided generally that the material was to
be made public unless It wa3 determined by the

administra­

tive agency or the Government officials, it should be kept
confidential in this case.
In other instances there are situations in which
the statute provided that the material was to be generally
kept confidential unless the Government official decided that
it should be made public.
The terms varied also, x^hether it dealt with the
general categories of material or dealt with specific
material and it also varied with respect to the basis upon
which the Government official would act.
Now, we think the legislative history shows, and
ohe background of the Freedom of Information Act shows that
when Congress, in Exemption three referred to material
specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, what it
meant to do was to preserve intact all of these existing
statutes.

12

It used, we think, the word ’’specifically exempted,”
not in terms that the statute specified the particular
documents to be withheld, as the Court of Appeals held, as
our opponents argue, but that the statute

was the statute

that specified nondisclosure in terms rather than merely
implying it.
That is, a statute which would be relied upon
because of the public policy reflected in the statute and
by implication sanctioning nondisclosure.
The purpose of Exemption three and the purpose of
the whole Freedome of Information Act was to eliminate the
prior practice under the Administrative Procedure Act by
which al'l Government officials could ju.3t keep anything
they wanted secret on a simple decision that it was recuired
in the public interest.
We have set forth in considerable detail in our
brief the legislative history of Exemption three and it
shows that over a period of eight years, during which
Congress considered a number of bills containing this
identical language, that the Congress was aware that there
are a large number of these statutes and that Congress
intended not to change them, keep them intact, to leave
them as they were.
uet me just refer to two
vhis rather clearly.

items which I think show

In the 1966 House Committee Report

which we have quoted at page 18 of our brief, which was the
report on the bill actually enacted, the Committee stated
that there are nearly 100 statutes or parts of statutes
which were strict public access to specific government
records.

These would not be modified by the public records

provision of Sll60 which is the bill ultimately enacted.
Then over on page 19 is a statement by Senator
Hruska during the 1963 hearings at an earlier phase of the
consideration of this litigation.
I'm sorry, Senator Long.

I stand corrected.

He

was one of the sponsors and proponents of the bill and what
he said was,"Statutes which curtail the availability of
information to the public are not intended to be affected
by the enactment of this bill," and, two sentences after
that, "It should be made clear that this bill in no way
limits statutes specifically written with the Congressional
intent of curtailing the flow of information as a supplement
necessary to the proper functioning of certain agencies."
In other words, what Congress was doing here was,
it was deferring to the judgment of earlier legislative
bodies made as a result of specific consideration of the
particular problem, it was deferring to their judgment that
certain situation that was to be non-disclosure.
It did not intend, we think, very clearly, by
Exemption three, to appeal by Implication any of the

14
existing statutes.
We think the case thus closely parallels the Mink
case where in the Mink case it was argued that because the
Executive order that was relied on as the basis for
classifying the material secret and top secret did not Itself
refer to the particular documents.
The claim
one.

was, They are not covered by Exemption

This Court rejected it.
Similarly, it seems to us here the fact that the

particular statute may not have been as detailed and the
specificity may vary considerably, that is no basis for
saying that Congress did not intend them to be‘covered or
that Congress intended in each instance for the Court
considering this and, I add, for the Administrative official
having to make the decision whether to disclose, for him
to try to figure out whether the particular statute was
specific enough to to bring it within the coverage of
Exemption three.
Congress was not making that kind of a determination.
Congress was adopting all of these many, many statutes that
had previously been enacted and was leaving them as they
were.
It said, in effect, "We will accept what other
Congresses have concluded when they specifically dealt with
a particular problem."

15
Now, our opponents tell us It is inconsistent with
the determination that Congress made in the Freedom of
Information Act to eliminate the old public interest stan­
dards under the Administrative Procedure Act while at the
same time to have intended to permit the nondisclosure of
material under the Standard in Section 1104 which refers to
the public interest.
Now, we think there is a very significant
difference between it because In 1104, Congress made a
specific determination with respect to the circumstances
under which the material of the Federal Aviation Administration was to be disclosed.
So we are saying this was not part of a program
under which everybody could disclose.
Congress made a determination way back in 1938 when
it first enacted the Civil Aeronautics Act that when there
was a protest to material In the hands of the Federal
Aviation Administration, that it was up to the Administrator
with his expert judgment to balance on the one hand the
injury that would result to the people protesting the
documents.
That is, the adverse effect upon the people who
were protesting.
And on the other hand, the public interest in
disclosure.

And It left it to the Administrator to make that

16
balance.

That is Congress.
And in this statute, it specifically focused on

this problem and we —
QUESTION:

Well, prior to the Freedom of Information

Act of 1966, the Federal Aviation Administrator could have
withheld, either under the standard of the old Freedom of
Information Act or under the 1933 statute.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

Is that correct?
He may have had to

make a somewhat different determination under the old Free­
dom of Information Act — I’m sorry, under the old Adminis­
trative Procedure Act.

But he certainly — and he could

have withheld under this statute and there would have been
no basis on which I don’t think that could have been obtained
prior to the Freedom of Information Act.
So the basic argument, of course, is that somehow
in Exemption three, when they spoke of a meterial specifi­
cally exempted from disclosure in statute, they somehow, by
implication, repealed the provision of HO1! and that is —
we don’t think that is what Congress intended.
We think that Congress intended to continue all of
these statutes.
QUESTION:

Well, I think you are twisting your

opponent’s argument a little bit.

The argument is that the

enactment of the Freedom of Information Act served to repeal
1104 and that Exemption three doesn’t cover it.

17
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I don’t think so, Mr. Justice.

I don’t understand him to say that the enactment of the
entire statute will repeal 1104.
QUESTION:

Well, that 1104 is not under any of the

exemptions and explicitly not under Exemption three because,
well, you know the arguments.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, it’s not —

It is not a statute that Is specific in

saying what shall —
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, my only point is, Mr. Justice,

if 1104 is not under Exemption three

and if we don’t know

whether it would be covered by the other exemptions, the
practical effect of that is that, at least as far as 1104
is concerned, the Administrator can no longer rely on that
provision, it seems to me, as a

basis for keeping it

confidential and that is the provision that Congress
provided almost 40 years ago and we therefore think that
the Administrator correctly — or did in this case — that
the SWAP reports are materials specifically exempted from
disclosure under Exemption three and that therefore, the
Respondents are not entitled to obtain.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr, Morrison.

Very well, Mr. Friedman.

18
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ALAN 3. MORRISON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OP RESPONDENTS
MR. MORRISON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
MR. MORRISON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
This matter began in the summer of 1970, when the
Respondents and others sought to learn more about aviation
safety in this country and they sought access to a number of
documents under the Freedom of Information Act, including
the SWAP reports, which are the only documents still at
i

issue in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, was this Inquiry prompted

by some formal study of some sort?

I couldn’t quite glean

that.
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, Mr. Robertson and

Mr. Simandle were both engaged in an ongoing study at the
Aviation [Administration].

Mr. Simandle is a student now

and has left that particular study which he was just working
on that particular summer.

But they are engaged in a con­

tinuing on-going surveillance through the Aviation Consumer
Action Project of trying to find out whether all aspects of
the aviation industry, that is, the safety aspects which are
handled by the FAA, which is before us and whether the
economic aspects handled by the CAB are designed in a way

19

and operated in a way to benefit the public, and the consumers
at large.
QUESTION:

They are acting in private capacity

entirely.
MR. MORRISON:

That Is correct, your Honor.

That

is correct.
QUESTION:

Would any citizen have the same right to

bring their suit?
MR. MORRISON:

Absolutely, your Honor.

And that is

one of the important aspects of the Freedom of Information
Act and why it is different from the law before 1966 xfhich
Justice Rehnquist mentioned just a minute ago that, regard­
less of whatever test it was, your Honor, it would, not have
ma.de any difference what test applied because a citizen
had to be properly and directly concerned with the informa­
tion before he could pry it loose from the Government and
there was no way that an ordinary citizen, Just simply
wants ng to find out whether airlines are operating prop>erly,
could have gotten this information regardless of whether
HCMl was an actual barrier.
QUESTION:
weren't there?

Well, there were two changes, really,

Probably more than that.

But one was to do

away with the so-called "standing requirement."
show an interest in the thing.
MR. MORRISON:

Absolutely correct.

You had to

20

QUESTION:

And the second, was to do away with the

general right of a Government official to say that public
interest requires this to be classified In secret.
MR. MORRISON:

That is right.

But Congress made the

legislative judgments in 1966 as to what ought to be withheld
as being in the public interest and everything else had to
be disclosed.
specific

Everything had to be disclosed but for the

exemptions.
So the Respondents wanted these documents for two

reasons.

One, to check on the airlines themselves to see

whether the airlines were doing what they could to prevent
accidents from taking place before they took place.
And, second3 to see whether the PAA was doing Its
job keeping an eye

on the airlines.

Now, while their request was administratively
pending, the ATA — Air Transport Association, on behalf of
28 airlines, unbeknownst to Respondent, sent a two-page
letter to the PAA which is reproduced at pages 112 and 113
of the Appendix and they simply said, we invoke. 1104 and ask
you to Invoke 1104 to prohibit these documents from being
disclosed.
Section 1104 permits two agencies and only two
agencies of the' Government, the PAA for safety and the GAB
for economic regulation matters relating to the airlines, to
withhold from the public any document that those agencies see

21
fit, if they make the determination that to release the
documents

is not required in the public: interest.
Now3 without the knowledge of the Respondents and

without asking for their position, the PAA simply,

based on

this two-page conclusiory letter, ruled that all past,
present and future SWAP reports that might be prepared by
any Administrator, or under his direction, of the FAA from now
or hereafter xvere to be exempt as not in the public Interest
regardless of the special need, regardless of the special
circumstances or anything whatsoever.
It was almost a rule, wherever —
QUESTION:

Would your client have had a right to

appeal that under the Administrative Procedure Act?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, your Honor, the Government

says that we could take an appeal on that order under M9
USC, Section 1*186.

The CAB and the PAA have jurisdictional

appeals to the Court of Appeals as opposed to the District
Court.

I don't know what the test for standing is going to

be under that provision.

I would think that the Government

would assert, may well assert that we have to have a
specialized interest on it.
QUESTION:

But if your quarrel is with the propriety

of that particular determination rather than with the fact
that however

sound that determination Is, It can’t prevail

over the Freedom of Information Act.

22

I should think your remedy would he by appeal of
that determination.
MR. MORRISON:

That is right.

My point is not

specifically that that determination was wrong, although I
believe it to be wrong and we so urge it, your Honor.

Eut I

believe that the problem is created by the fact that if, for
instance, the Government is correct that we do have a remedy
and assuming that they don't argue standing and that we can
get into Court, we then go to the Court of Appeals for the
.

District of Columbia Circuit, for instance.
d

Well, there we are in the Court of Appeals with our
1104 Issue but meanwhile, the Government: has said, oh, you
can’t get these documents for three other reasons.
Exemption four says they are confidential commercial
financial information.
Exemption five says these are Intraagency memoranda,
all of which, of course, were prepared by the FAA although, of
c ourse, given to the airlines and then they also said, well,
they are investigatory files,
QUESTION:

Well, nobody promised you a rose garden.

MR. MORRISON:

No, your Honor, but I would at least

like to know where I can take my client to court.
to the Court of Appeals with all the claims?

Do we go

And if we go

there with all the claims, are the busy judges of the United
States Court of Appeals going to try the factual questions

23
arising under these exemptions?

What about other rights,

rights to expedition, rights to standing, rights to
attorneys’ fees, all of these are special rights created
under the Freedom of Information Act.
Do we take them all with us to the Court of Appeals
as we go under i486?

Well, I don't know what the ansxirer to

that question is but if we don’t go there, do we go to the
District Court and do we have a bifurcated

proceeding of

some kind with one proceeding in one court and one in the
other?
These problems, your Honor, are not insoluble.

They

could be worked out if it were necessary but we suggest that
the very practical reasons counsel

against having

this

kind of a situation where we end up in one Court with one
issue, one with another issue and create a procedural quag­
mire whicil Congress surely never could have intended and
can readily be averted by simply saying to the FAA and the
CAB, look, you are just like everybody else. You have got all
the rest of your defenses under the Freedom of Information
Act.

Don't look for a home run with Section 1104 because

that is what it is.

It takes us right out of tkhe ball park.

Any document whatsoever in the possession of the
Administrator or the CAB, it is out.

We can’t get it unless

we can convince the Court of Appeals, according to the
Government, that it is not in the public interest.

24
What is the standard of review?
Under the Freedom of Information Act, we are
entitled to a trial de novo.
de novo on this?

Are we going to have a trial

No, I don’t think so.

I am sure the Government would not argue that we are
entitled to it so there we are, back with a very limited
scope of review based upon the kind of record we have here,
which is almost nonreviewable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, coming

back to the ques­

tion I asked you, you responded that any citizen would have
the same right to sue.

Let's assume you win this case.

Would any citizen have to make any showing to be
entitled to the documents arid reports that you desire?

Or

would It suffice if you merely wrote a letter to the FAA
and said, "Please put me on your

mailing list.

From now on,

I want every one of these reports, othervrise, I am going to
sue. "
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, In most cases the

Government agencies, once a final, authoritative ruling by
either this Court or appropriate Court of Appeals has been
issued, has been lollowing the Freedom of Information Act
and has been adhering to the rule — the rule that has been
enunciated and we would expect, as It happened in this case,
y°ar U°nor, once we were judged to be entitled to the MRR’s,
those mechanical reliability reports that were not appealed

25
by the Government, we got those reports.

We were put on the

mailing list and it is my understanding that anyone now can
go in and ask for the same reports and get them just as we
do so I would assume that the good faith of the Government
would be such that no one would have to sue the PAA again to
get these particular reports.
We would be more than glad to furnish them to any­
one who is prepared to pay the cost to us.
QUESTION:

You are offering to pay the costs your­

self, aren't you?
MR. MORRISON:

For copies, yes, your Honor.

There

are provisions in the statute that permit the waiving of fees.
We may, in some of these cases, not want to actually copy the
document's.
The Act provides for two means of access.
access.

One is

That is, you can go over and look at the documents

and inspect them.

If you decide you want them, you can

have them.
It also provides for copies at cost and there are
provisions of waivers for cost.

Whether we would want all

of the documents all of the time, I couldn't say, your Honor,
but we do want the access to them so we can start to look at
them and see what is really in them.
Incidentally, there is a portion of one of these
SWAP reports which is reproduced in the Joint Appendix that I

26
commerui to your examination.
QUESTION:

Do you remember what page?

MR. MORRISON:

I think it is about page 40 but I

am not positive — 34 to 36.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. MORRISON:

So, based upon the determination by

the —
QUESTION:

How did this get into the record,

incidentally?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, a copy of that was

attached — that was attached to the affidavit of the
Plaintiff, Mr. Robertson.

He obtained a copy of it and that

was put in the record to give the District Court an Idea —
QUESTION:

Of what kind of an animal we are talking

ab out.
MR. MORRISON:

That is exactly right, your Honor.

That is exactly right.
QUESTION:

How did he obtain this?

MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I was not counsel at the

time that that was put in and I do not know, your Honor.
These doucments are

not classified in the sense

that a top secret document would be classified.

They are

available and around and, while it was on the understanding
between the Agency and the air carrier that the documents
are not to be — are not generally made available to the

27
the public and it so stated in the handbook which is pre­
pared that they are not generally made available to the
public, there was no formal ruling and, indeed, the specific
request of the ATA in this case to hold these things confi­
dential belies the notion that it was a generally-accepted
practice that even — that notwithstanding the Freedom of
Information Act, it could be withheld.
Incidentally, in that regard, I may point out that
the fact that a particular individual may have expected the
Government to keep a document confidential is, of course, no
defense to a request under the Freedom of- Information Act.'
Now, the Congress has overridden that and a private
agreement between a particular individual and the Government
is noo Itself a reason unless the document otherwise comes
within one of the exemptions to the Act.
Based upon the determination by the FAA that 1104
applied and that it ought to be Invoked, the Respondents'
request was denied and based upon the three other exemptions
I mentioned earlier, the Respondents' final administrative
remedies were exhausted and this action thereafter ensued.
jae

District Court rejected all of the defenses

raised by the Petitioners and the Court of Appeals ruled
solely on the Exemption three claim and therefore that is the
only issue we have before this Court.
It remanded the matter for further proceedings with

28
respect to the other defenses raised by the Government.
Nows Exemption three permits the withholding of
documents which are, in the language of that provision,
specifically exempted from disclosure by statute and the
question presented is, are the SWAP reports specifically
exempted from disclosure by Section 1104, aa the Petitioners
urge, even though these reports are not mentioned in Section
1104 and the basis for withholding them is the determination
by the head of the PAA that the public interest does not
require their disclosure.
Now, we suggest that if the position of the
Government is indeed adopted he^,e9 the result would be a
creation of a wholesale exception to the Freedom of Informa­
tion Act for these two agencies, the PAA for safety and the
CAB for economics.
They could simply decide for themselves where the
public interest lies and

hold or release documents

accordingly.
Now, we believe that that was not Congressional
intent.
Moreover, the result in this situation

that the

Government urges here is inconsistent with the intent in
Congress in repealing former Section three of the APA and
enacting the Freedom of Information Act.

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Morrison, you may

continue.
MR. MORRISON:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The result that the Plaintiff and Respondents are
urging in this case is supported amply by an examination of
the overall Congressional purpose in enacting the Freedom
of Information Act.
Nov/, this purpose was plainly to replace the vast
administrative discretion that was available under the old
APA Section three to withhold and which ran rampant under
that statute so that, as this Court said in Mink, the
statute became more of a withholding than a disclosing
statute.

And Congress decided that it, rather than the

Agency, should decide what documents ought to be disclosed
and where the public interest lay in specific situations
and it did this in the following way:
a'

It said that all documents were to be disclosed
except for those specifically exempted.
specific exemptions in Section 552B.

It set up nine

Now, for eiCht of

these, Congress, that wrote the Freedom of Information Act

30

in 1966s set forth those standards and I include in those
eight, Exemption one because the important thing about
Exemption one is, although it may reference to an executive
order, it was an executive order which permitted withholding
only in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
And that, in our view, readily distinguishes it
from the kind of open-ended statute we have here.

It makes

the national defense standard of exemption one similar to
other kind of standards that are set forth in the other
provision of the Freedom of Information Act although, in
fact, the mechanism for bringing it about is somewhat
different.
But, basically, there Is a Congressional imposition
of a standard there, just as there was a Congressional
imposition of a standed rep;arding the other substantive
exemption.
Now, with respect to the last exemption, Exemption
number three, the one we have before this Court, the Court
decided that, rather than striking a new balance between
where the public interest lay, where Congress had previously
spoken, It decided to defer to the judgment of prior
Congresses and that is by going back and saying, we'll
continue, in effect, prior statutory exemptions.

V/e won't

second-guess the determinations, specific judgments made by
the prior Congress.

31
Indeed., the Government’s reply brief in this Court
said that what Congress was really doing was that it
decided it would not attempt to reexamine or distingujsh
prior legislative judgments.
The

question we have to ask here is, was there the

kind of legislative judgment in Section 1104, given the
fact that it is qo open-ended, both with respect to the kind
of documents and the standards for disclosure.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t 1104, though, rest on some

additional finding about an adverse effect upon the
Interests of private parties?
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, there is that —

And it Isn’t that the public interest

requires — that the public interest requires it to remain
secret, but that the interest — and that disclosure Is not
required in the public interest.
MR. MORRISON:

Both phrases are in there, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But they must find that private interests

would be adversely affected.
MR. MORRISON:

Whatever the interest is of the

requesting party and your Honor, as

we read

the statute,

indeed, even another PAA official could make the request that
the information not be disclosed.
person may make a request."

It simply says, "Any

There is nothing specifically

32

limited in that.
But confining it specifically to the question that
your Honor asked, we view the adversely affected simply as
another side of the same public interest determination that,
really, once someone has requested that a document be made
available, it is, after all, a Government document, that it
ought in the general course to be made available as being
in the public interest for the public to know what is going
on, unless there is some kind of adverse Interest.
We suggested in our- brief at footnote seven on
page 13 that, indeed, the adversely-affected standard was
subsumed in, as part of the same public interest standard.
We don't understand —
QUESTION:

Well, I would think you would argue

that the Board doesn't even have to find that the public
interest requires that it be kept secret, that it is a much
even a lesser standard than that.
All that it requires is —
QUESTION:

It is conjunctive.

MR. MORRISON:

It is conjunctive, yes, sir.

I

believe they must find it as adversely —
QUESTION:

That is right. I .know,'but it doesn't —

but all they have to find is that the public interest, that
it doesn't require the disclosure.

It doesn't have to find

that the public interest requires non-disclosure.

33
MR. MORRISON:
pointy I think.

That is right.

I understand your

I adopt it and do so vigorously, that it is

an even less-restricted standard.

That is, the burden is

almost on the public rather than on the withholding, rather
than the other way around.

We don't have to find that the

secrecy is required as the old APA did, but merely that the
public interest doesn't require that the document be
released.
QUESTION:

If it adversely affects that.

MR. MORRISON:

That's right.

And we say that that

Is all really partially subsumed in the same standard.
QUESTION:

But that does narrow the area, it seems

to me, in terms of whether it is open-ended or not.

Some­

body has to file something and say, here is why, and the
board has to find it adversely affects the interest of
somebody.
Now, that certainly just isn't an open-ended
Invitation to the agency.
i‘IR. MORRISON:
make that determination.

Well, there is somebody that has to
I don’t know whether the Board or

one FAA could do it on their own.

We

believe they could.

Indeed, in a case — in a couple of cases we cited
in our brief —
QUESTION:

Well, it didn’t here, anyway.

MR. MORRISON:

No, your Honor, it did not here.

34
That Is correct, at least as far as the record discloses.
QUESTION:

Well, for example, under 1104A, suppose

one of these SWAP reports spoke disparagingly of a particu­
lar mechanic.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

By name.

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is right.

Yes, sir.

Now, under 1104A, could he come in and

ask that that SWAP report could not be published because,
he says, that is going to affect me personally.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

He could.

And then, I gather, the board has to

make the further Inquiry whether nevertheless the interest
of the public would require it.
MR. MORRISON:

But more importantly, your Honor,

for the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, that
mechanic would — may well be protected under the Sixth
Exemption which prevents clearly unwarranted Invasions of
personal' privacy.
The important thing about 1104, it is not either/or
or nothing.

The sole defense does not become 1104 or nothing,

it is 1104 or whatever else every other agency has.
QUESTION:

But you would — in Mr. Justice Brennan's

example you would say that that document is not exempt under
this particular section.

35
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Despite this exemption.

Despite the

adverse effect on them that 1104 just has no application
whatsoever.
MR. MORRISON:

That is right.

That is precisely

our position.
QUESTION:

But it has been,, in effect, repealed.

MR. MORRISON:

Except — except, your Honor, to

this limited area it provides a mechanism for persons who
wish to have documents that are otherwise — that the
Agency might release If it chose.
For instance, in this mechanic’s report, the Sixth
Exemption is discretionary.,

The Agency need not withhold

documents imply because it might withhold the document.
QUESTION:

Weli# i gather what you are saying is,

to have something xvhich would protect the mechanic, you
would have to be, under three, that is, there would have to
be an explicit statute which said "And no SWAP reports that
involve a mechanic and they adversely affect him, shall be
published."
MR. MORRISON:

I think we can go — make it a

broader statute than that, your Honor.
QUESTION:

How much broader?

For in tance —

36
MR. MORRISON:

Well, let's take the area of the

Veterans' Administration which would be not dissimilar.
QUESTION:

Anybody named Jones, huh?

MR. MORRISON:

Anybody named Jones or mechanics —

the Veterans' Administration has a statute, Title 38, Section
3301, which says that any matter relating to any claim of a
veteran under this chapter may be — shall be withheld unless
one of the following conditions.

No question in our mind

about that.
QUESTION:

No, I mean any matter involving any

mechanic.
MR. MORRISON:

That's right.

If that is what the

statute said, we don't have any problems with that.

If the

problem here is —
QUESTION:

But unless it is like that you say it

doesn't come within -MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Exemption three.

Exemption three.

MR. MORRISON:

some
Because Exemption three uses/words

that we believe are fairly narrow words.

They are not the

clearest words that I have ever seen written and I couldn't
say that they are, but they do suggest a narrow construction,
specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.
The "by statute —"
QUESTION:

I know, but if they are that ambiguous,

37
I

take it then, the legislative history becomes quite

important, doesn’t it?
MR.MORRISON:
yes, your Honor.

The general legislative history does,

We don't think that — we think that they

suggest and strongly infer that it is the statute that must
have a major important role in making the exemption rather
than the Administrator.
Here, everything is on the Administrator.

There is

nothing that the statute commands to do except set the most
general terms of the exemption.

It does not constitute, in

our view, a legislative judgment.
Congress did not sit down and say, well, now, what
are we going to do about this kind of problem?

It didn’t

focus in as it did on, for instance, tax returns and said,
across-the-board tax returns shall not be disclosed except in
certain circumstances.
We think that is what Congress did with the other
exemptions and chat it simply, in the third Exemption,
adopted prior legislative judgments that were similar in
kind to the kind it was making in 1966 with regard to all of
the exemptions except number three.
QUESTION:

What is it that is protected If it Is

specifically exempted from disclosure by statute"?
It is not documents, is it?
MR. MORRISON:

That is right.

It is matters.
And that, I think,

38
your Honor, means that portions of documents can be withheld
whereas the entire document may not be.

And that is as I

interpret it.
Originally;, when the statute was written, it
referred to particularized records of the statutes9 were
rearranged and shuffled around but .1 don't think anyone
believes that there is any difference between the particu­
larized records that could be withheld and the matters that
are now focused on.
This has even been made very clear in. the recent
amendments to the Freedom of Information Act where they
specifically spell out that certain parts of documents can't
be made available, a practice which had been followed before,
even though other parts might have to be disclosed.
QUESTION:

But the fact that the phrase is matters

rather that documents may conceivably shed some light on the
meaning oi specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,
may it not?
MR. MORRISON:

It might, your Honor, but there is

no legislative history, and we have gone over every bit
of it that we could.
QUESTION:

Well, I was just thinking of the

legislative language, rather than the legislative history.
MR. MORRISON:

Well, I would say this, your Honor.

There is no indication that any place in the Congress anyone

39
focused on the words "matters” as opposed to "documents"
or

"particularized records."

There doesn’t seem to be any

precise focus on these matters, as we suggest there was no
focus on the language, for instance, comparing
Exemption or the Third Exemption.

the First

They just were treated

differently and I don’t think that there has been any
evidence of any focus —QUESTION:

But surely, "matters" has a broader

connotation than the word "document."
MR. MORRISON:

Doesn’t it?

QUESTION:

Well, I —

I would say —

I mean, literally.

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, that is right.

the context, matters in general might.

But I mean, in

But in the context

of the Freedom of Information Act where we are, after all,
only talking about documents — records is the

precise

term the Act has.
QUESTION:

But neither is there any suggestion in

legislative history that any of these statutes such as .1104
were intended to be repealed.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

And —

MR. MORRISON:

We don’t believe it was repealed.

OUr question really is, did Congress intend to encompass

40

within Exemption three, an open-ended statute like 1104?
QUESTION:

Would your argument be the same If

Congress today passed a statute like 1104?
MR. MORRISON:

YOur Honor, I was thinking about that

before I came here today.
QUESTION:

Well, I would think you would, yes.

MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

And the answer is, I would

suggest, yes, to your HOnor, the answer is yes.
QUESTION:

Well, you would have to, wouldn’t you?

MR. MORRISON:

Well, I would suppose you would have

a little legislative history at that point, your Honor, and
I think it probably could be —
QUESTION:

Well, ’were any of the 100 statutes that —

or, has Congress passed any statutes such as this since the
Freedom of Information Act?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, they have passed statutes

that have, in some respects, restricted access to documents
but all of them have had either a standard as to the type
of documents, for instance, the Transportation Board statute
last year -QUESTION:

The mechanic’s-type document.

MR. MORRISON:
that, your Honor.

Well, I would say much broader than

I would say, it was documents in connec­

tion with the safety investigation shall not be disclosed or
may not be disclosed except in certain circumstances.

They

41
either tell us what kind of documents we are dealing with.
They are in some sense specific.

Indeed, the House

report speaks about specific records which are withheld by
these statutes, the very House report relied on by the
Government and we suggest that in this exemption that
Congress was talking about specific records and not merely
the kind of general open-ended application to any documents
in the files of CAB or the PAA.

The Government says those

can be withheld under 1104.
QUESTION:

Wien was the compilation of 100 statutes

made?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I can't tell you when it

was because I don't think there was one.

There was a I960

compilation prepared by the Library of Congress.
back

We went

and tallied those yesterday, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Was it ever done by a legislative

committee or by —
MR. MORRISON:

No, that was referred to by ■— it

was actually put into a legislative form by a committee of
the House of Representatives in I960,

But that particular-

document has far more than 100 statutes in it.
QUESTION:

When was the FBderal Aviation Act passed?

MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

193$ and then it was —

Was It reenacted?

MR. MORRISON:

It was reenacted in 1953»

QUESTION:

With this section in it.

MR. MORRISON:

That is correct.

It was the Civil

Aeronautics Act in 1938, and then 1953 and there have been
some changes and codifications but, essentially, 1104 has
remained practically unchanged and for these purposes,
unchanged since then.
The I960 compilation has, under the list of
disclosure discretionary statutes, it has 79.

National

Security disclosure prohibited 26 and the general confi­
dentiality, 68.

I don't know quite what that totals up to,

but that's far more than 100 and I might also point out,
your Honor, that 1104, the statute relied upon by the
Government, is not in that list of 100 any place.
The only time it ever appears any place Is as an
exhibit to a 1958 hearing that was closed before the exhibit
got there and the same organization, the Library of Congress,
which prepared that exhibit in 1958, also prepared this
document here two years later and did not include it.
So I think that our search for a single touchstone
is bound to fail.
QUESTION:

Is there anything illogical or extra­

ordinary about the fact that Congress, In passing an Act
in such sweeping terms, would not pause to try to Identify
all of the specific statutes which they had previously
passed granting nondisclosure?

The acts of Congress, now,

il3

not by some administrative decision.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Yes. sir.

Is there anything unusual about their

saying, ’Jte to all the matters on which we, previously, made
a legislative judgment,

we are going to preserve that

privilege of nondisclosure"?
MR. MORRISON:
necessarily illogical.

No, I don’t think there is anything
We would simply say, your Honor,

that 1104 doesn't represent the kind of legislative judgment
that we think is required before the statute comes within
Exemption three.
After all, the real import of the Freedom of
Information Act was that Congress was taking control of
itself.

it

It was taking it away from the administration.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish between — you

lost me there, Mr. Morrison, as to different kinds of
legislative judgment.
MR. MORRISON:
QUESTION:

Well, we —

I thought they were all about the same,

althogh some good, some bad, but they are all on the same
level in terms of how they do it, aren't they?
MR. MORRISON:

In terms of how they do it, your

Honor, but the question of whether Congress has made a
determination as to what lies in the public interest in
terms of disclosure, the legislative judgment in this sense.

We say a legislative judgment is reflected by one
of three characteristics, either the particular document
that is to be withheld is to be described in the legislation,
tax returns, for example.
document may not be

Or

Congress has said, the

disclosed — as it said — for tax

returns, materials from the CIA — shall not be disclosed —
atomic energy information.
Or, third, It has proscribed some standards under
which the Administrator may exercise Its discretion.
In other words, we view it as a kind of a reduction
in the amount of delegation.
Previously, the administrative agencies had a lot of
delegation and we think Congress intended very narrowly to
reduce that delegation to a much lower level than had
previously existed.
That is why we believe that 1104, which Is far
broader than any other statute, does not apply here.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
rebuttal.

I’d just like to say one thing in

As we read the statute and the history of it and

the language of it, there is nothing in the history or the
language of Exemption three

suggesting that Congress

intended to limit the applicability of the statutes that it
was continuing to ones that reflected a particular type of

47
legislative judgment.

We think the Congress speaks — we

don't know how many are there, 70, 80, 90, 100, but Congress
intended to keep all of them in existence.

That is what

the legislation —
QUESTION:

As I gather, Mr. Friedman, that Is

really that If the subject is non-disclosure, no matter
what form it takes, that is within Exemption three.
MR. MORRISON:

That is precisely it, Mr, Justice

and the reason, the reason for this we think is that when
Congress came to deal with the problem of what to do with
prior statutes that provided for non-disclosure, it decided
to leave the situation as it was and this statute, 1104,
represents a particularized Congressional treatment of this
problem.
Congress decided in this area it was going to
leave it to

the informed discretion of the Administrator-

reflecting on the one hand, injury to the

people who were

protesting it and, second, on the other hand, whether,
despite this injury, it was required in the public interest
and we think Congress, In Exemption three, intended to defer
to that judgment and as in this case, when the Administratormade that judgment, Exemption three requires that this
material not be disclosed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
