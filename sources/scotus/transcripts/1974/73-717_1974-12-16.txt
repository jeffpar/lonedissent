We will hear arguments

Washington.
Mr1. Morisset, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MASON D. MORISSET ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MORISSET:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Antoine v. State of Washington is here on appeal

from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and involves
the hunting rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville
Indian Reservation on hand which was sold by them to the United
States Government in 1891, having been, prior to that time,
a part of their reservation as set aside by the President in
1872.
The facts are fairly simple.

Mr. Antoine and his

wife Irene shot a deer in the fall of 1971 on this land during
a time in which hunting was closed by the laws of the State of
Washington.

The Colville Confederated Tribes and Mr. Antoine

are of the opinion that their rights to hunt on that land were
guaranteed by the 1391 sales agreement as ratified by the
Congress and that the State of Washington has no right to stop
them from hunting there whatsoever, or in the alternative, if
some right is found, the State can do so only upon a prior
showing of necessity for conservation.

4
Let, T3 trace the chronology briefly of what
happened on what we call the "old north half'1 cf the Colville
Reservation»

This was the aboriginal horae of various tribes

and bands which now make up the Confederated Colville Tribes,
There was no treaty signed with these groups and bands but
finally in 1072 the President set aside approximately 3 million
acres of land as a reservation.
Order,

This is the 1872 Executive

Thereafter the State of Washington, or what was then

the Territory of Washington,

was admitted to the Union in

1389,
In 1891 the Congress formed a commission to go and,
in the words of the Act, meet and treat with the Indians to
buy and purchase whatever land they might wish to sell.

An

agreement was reached to sell the north half of the reserva­
tion, approximately 1,5 million acres, running up to the
Canadian border and between the Okanagan and Columbia Rivers.
That agreement was not immediately ratified by the
Congress.

Rather, in 1892, the Congress passed an Act which

unilaterally took the land back.

Subsequently, the Indians

agitated and lobbied for the ratification of their agreement
and the payment of the money.

This was ultimately accomplished

in 1906 by an appropriation Act whereby the Congress, to
carry into effect the agreement, authorized the payment of
money and thereafter in subsequent appropriation Acts
actually authorized the payment in $300,000 increments of the

money.
Now,

1872, than, finds the vesting of hunting

and fishing rights in this land in question bv the Federal
Government.f was an Indian reservation with all the rights that
go along with that,- the right to exclude non-Indians from that
land- the right to fish and hunt without control, by the
territorial or State government and the many other rights
which this Court knows attend a reservation status.
In 1831, the Indians agreed to surrender and relinquish
all rights and title to the land, but they reserved nany rights.
They reserved, for example, allotments in this area, and to
this day many members of the tribe still live? on their allotment
on this sold land.

They reserved the right to the use of the

water and water courses attendant to those allotments, and
they reserved, in section 6 of the agreement that the right to
fish and hunt shall not be taken away or in any vise abridged.
QUESTION:

These lands, Mr. Morisset, are they

subject to taxation?
MR. MORISS.ET:

The allotted lands are net, your Honor,

they are trust land held by the United States..
QUESTION:

The State of Washington makes no point

about it, they are just tax free, property taxes.
MR., MORIS SET:

That's correct.

That's correct.

This incident, however, did not occur cv, trust land,
your Honor.

I vmnt to make that clear.

It did not occur on

6
trust land.
QUESTIONS

It occurred on what kind of land?

MR. MORISSET:

As far as we know, this is fee

simple land held probably by an individual.

None of the maps

that I have seen, and it was not submitted at trial, indicate
who exactly owns the land.

It is open, not posted or fenced,

as far as we know, is not State land as far as I know, is
not Federal forest land.
QUESTION:

This.'

the land on which .it occurred

is subject to State taxation?
MR. MORISSET:
individual in fee.
QUESTION:

It probably is if it’s held by an

I think we can assume that it is.
I take it your answer to my question

about taxability is based on the trust land aspect rather
than on the agreement which provided for tax exemption.
MR. MORISSET:

That's partly correct, your Honor,

but the agreement, by setting up the allotment, would be the
document from which that non-taxability flows.

It was the

agreement that said the Indians may reserve some allotted
land on that north half.

But it is the status of the land

itself rather than the agreement that leads to the non­
taxability, that's true.
QUESTION:

Focusing on the land where this hunting

occurred, are other people, other than members of this tribe,
permitted to hunt there?

/

MR. MORISSET:

Non-Indians who are citizens of the

State would certainly be allowed to hunt there, yes.

It is

not a closed area per se, it's not posted or fenced off or
posted as no hunting.
QUESTION:

There is no question about the State's

right to require licenses or any other restriction with respect
to others than members of this tribe.
MR. MORISSET:

That is correct, your Honor, there is

no question about that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morisset, during my brief tenure on

the Court I have heard the terra "allotted lands" used in a
number of arguments involving Indian cases.

that terras means.

Can you define it?

MR. MORISSETs

Certainly, your Honor.

The United States generally holds land as a fee

Now, that land

An individual receives a
You give it to him, fcha

individual Indian has a right of usage of the land, ha has a
right to devise it by will, and in the state of intestacy it
would pass to his heirs under special Federal statute.

But

the Indian does not have a right to mortgage or alienate, that

0

land without the permission of the Secretary of the Interior,
because the Secretary, as the Government's agent, is the owner.
He has the fee.
QUESTION;

And the record title than is in the

United States.
MR. MORISSET:

United States Government.

A regular

title report would show fee in the United States of America,
in trust for, and then either the tribe as a whole or an
individual in it.
QUESTION;

That's the way the record would read.
If it is an individual Indian, then that

means it's allotted land.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Otherwise it's an ordinary part of a

reservation.
MR. MORISSET;

It would be non-aiiotted land.

Right.

Mon-allotted trust land.
QUESTION:

Is there some cut-off date in the statute,

or v/asn't there, or has it been indefinitely extended?
MR. MORISSET:

There is a variety of allotment

The general allotment Act had a cut-off date which

has been constantly and consistently continued by Congress.
QUESTION:

end at some time.
MR. MORISSET:

agreement.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Morisset. while we have you

interrupted, let me ask you another question or two.
Mrs. Antoine was also convicted.
MR, MORISSET:
QUESTION;

And she is a full-blooded Indian?

MR. MORISSET;
QUESTION;

She is Okanogan, yes,

But not an enrolled member of

MR. MORISSET;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Not enrolled in this country, no.

Do you raise any question about her

conviction, as such, at all?
MR. MORISSET;

I have not raised any question

because the facts which don’t appear in the record, because
they were not deemed to be material, I believe,» -are that she
could be no more than an aider and abetter, and. my position
would be, as a matter of criminal law, Mr. Antoine committed
no crime and she couldn’t very well have aided and abetted
him in such a non-act,
QUESTION:

There may" he something in the record,

as distinguished from the printed appendix, but I look at the

10
findings on page 12 of the appendix, findings entered byJudge Ennis, the only place in those findings that I find a
reference to Irene Antoine is in the title»

All the way down

through the rest of it, the reference is only to Alexander
Antoine.

So I ask what the situation is as to Irene.
Maybe I should ask the State this.

<

MR. MORIS SET r,

I don’t want to hedge the question,

but I suppose you could, your Honor.

My position is that she

can't have aided and abetted her husband if he did nothing
wrong.

There is nothing wrong for her —
QUESTION:

I find no findings or conclusions that

in effect —
MR. MORISSET:

That's correct, there are none.

QUESTION': — find her guilty.
MR. MORISSET:

There are no more findings on the

record Other than are printed in the appendix as to her, as
to Mrs» Antoine.
QUESTION:

But you are making no point of this.

MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

No.

Why?

Specifically, finding 4 refers to

Defendant, Alexander Antoine,and conclusion of law 2 and 3
speak of defendant in the singular.
well make a point of it.

I should think you might

This, of course, is my point

throughout-, I find no reference whatsoever to Irene.

And I'm

curious as to why you don't read this as a point of deficiency

11
in the judgment of conviction.
MR. MORISSET:

Well, I think it is a deficiency, but

I think the more central and more important point is that
Alex Antoine committed no crime and when his conviction falls,
Mrs. Antoine will, of necessity fall.

She could not have

done anything other than be along —
QUESTION:

But if you lose that, she is stuck if

you don't raise the secondary point.
MR. MORISSET;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

Well, in your questions presented on

page 4 of the jurisdictional statement, you certainly didn't
raise any question like that, did you?

And that's all that is

before the Court.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.

In any event, my question shall be

regarded as also asked of State counsel, and perhaps he can
explain it.
QUESTION:

Before you leave the question of these

allotted lands that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was pnasled about,
when the land is allotted, will you clarify for ma, is that
allotted the way conveyance of farm land, a piece of farm land,
is allotted by Meachenbaum's description or other specific
description?
MR. MORIS SET:

That’s a diff.1.c\ilt fact question

because it differs from reservation to .reservation.

But in

12
most cases the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or in the early years
the War Department, carried out some kind of survey, and many
of these reservation lands have special Government plats
that only exist in the archives,because I have tried to dig
them up, and they will be allotted by a lot number and they
will have an allotment number 141, and you have to go to an
original Government plat to find what that means, and sometimes
that will be a map or will be meets and bounds on some
occasions.

It differs greatly.
Now, I was, I believe, discussing the 1891 agreement

and noting that the Indians had to lobby for some time before
the agreement was carried into effect, approximately 15 years.
In 1906 the Congress did ratify the agreement, appropriate the
money to carry it into effect, and the money-was gradually paid
out over the years.
Now, the effecting agreement gives to appellants
that their hunting and fishing rights are guaranteed by
supreme Federal law.

The State seems to argue that this

agreement is not supreme Federal law and the State court in
Washington seemed to hold that.

I find no support for that

in any of the learning and teachings of this Court.

Certainly

Congress has plenary power over Indian tribes and has exercised
that power through the years.

Certainly at the time that the

promise was made, this was Federal land.

In fact, the whole

area was a territory, the whole area was Federal land, and the

13
particular area in question, the north half of the reservation,
was even more Federal than the 'whole territory, if that's
possible, because, it was an Indian reservation, and the
Federal Government had full authority and control over that
land as trustee for the.Indians.

So the two owners of the land,

the Government as the fee owner, and the Indians as the
beneficial owner, agreed as to how it would be sold and what
the terns would be.

And the Federal Government promised that

hunting and fishing rights would continue.
Now, the Federal Government has done this before in
other cases that have coma before this Court.

Dick v. U.S.,

for example, involved the sale of land by a tribe of their
reservation back to the Government, and the Government agreed
in the document that Federal liquor laws would continue to
aPPiy# notwithstanding incorporation of those areas into the
State thereafter.

And this Court held that, of course, the

Federal Government could do that.

It could take land back from

the Indians and apply conditions to it.
Our position, then, is that the Indians and the
Federal Government agreed as to what the terms would be of
ceding

the land back to the United States Government and that

the State of Washington had to take whatever power or jurisdiction or authority they have over that land, subject to
outstanding Federal promises, just the same as when they
became a State in 1889 most of the land at that time was tied

14
up in some sort of Federal ownership.
How, getting to the words of the agreement itself
as ratified by the Congress, it is our position that the words
"shall not be taken a\*ay or any wise be abridged," mean that
the State has no authority whatsoever to regulate Indians
hunting and fishing on that north half.

They took, or became

a State subject to the outstanding promise of the Federal
Government, and it is for the Federal Government and the
Indians to decide how hunting and fishing rights will be
exercised.
We believe that this case is unlike the Puyallup
litigation that this Court has had to struggle with, as has
the State courts in Washington, for many years now.

Unlike

it because the words of the agreement read as an absolute
promise.

Theyare much stronger than the Stevens treaties.

This Court has had to struggle with the Stevens treaties
which promise the right to hunt and fish in common with other
citizens of the territory.

And that's all the treaties say.

In this situation, the Federal agreement, the supreme law of
the land, says the right to hunt and fish in common with other
citizens of the United States shall not be taken away or in
any wise abridged.

And we feel it is an abridgement, an

impairment and abrogation of those rights if the State is
allowed any jurisdiction or authority whatsoever to regulate
Indian hunting and fishing.

15
We believe that a holding would be consistent with
this Court’s teaching as to the need for Indian tribes to
govern themselves.

This Court has held that hunting and fishing

rights are a tribal right to be exercised by individual
Indians, and we believe that
the Colville Confederated Tribes
.
can and will regulate this tribal right.
QUESTION:

I gather you have to ba a member of the

tribe, an enrolled member.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION;

That's correct.

I notice as to the wife, as you discussed

with Mr. Justice Blackmun earlier, you have a footnote in
your jurisdictional statement that she is an Indian but not
an enrolled member of the tribe.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

That’3 correct.

IIovj does that place her position as to

the defense?
MR. MORISSET:

Our position on that would be the same

as.it has been in fishing litigation in the State of Washington,
that spouses and immediate families should be allowed to
participate at least as helpers in the right.
QUESTION:

They have the benefit of the reservation,

than, would they?
MR, MORISSET:

Yes, of the reservational rights.

It really makes no practical sense to say that an
Indian has a hunting right which it can go slap his wife in

16
jail if she accompanies him, or if he catches a fish and takes
it home to feed his wife and children —
QUESTION:

If she were on her own?

Suppose she

was hunting on her own?
MR. MORISSET:

I still think the spouse should be

allowed to exercise the right. It is not practical in the
sense of Indian rights to not allow the immediate family, •
the spouse and children, to participate -QUESTION:

What has the law been where the reservation

applies?
MR. MORISSET:

There has been no holding by this

Court —
QUESTION:

Haw about the Washington courts?

MR. MORISSET: The only holding that I know of is
?
the holding of Judge Bolt in U.S. v. Washington in which he
held that — I don’t know if he .held it in the original
decision or subsequently — that the spouses should be allowed
to participate in the treaty right, in that case.
Our position here is basically the same, the spouse
should definitely he allowed to participate.
a policy argument.

That is purely

It makes sense in terms of how Indian

tribes operate, how Indian families operate, how they go
together to get their food, and so on.

No particular strict

reason in the law why that should be, but there is a reason
in equity.

1?
Wow, why don't we want any State power here?

We

feel that State regulation of Indian hunting and fishing rights
is and always has been a complicated procedure of allocating
the resource to user groups, a complicated procedure involving
political pressure, a complicated procedure involving many
competing groups in which the Indian interests get kind of
left to the bottom of the heap.

We further feel that it is

an impairment of tribal government.

This is a tribal right

guaranteed by Federal law, but the tribe doesn’t have anything
to say about it.

It can't take care of the resource, it

can't allocate the resource to its members, it can’t have any
kind of lottery system or permit system to allow the deer in
this

case to go to the most useful place, because the State

is controlling them.
QUESTIONj

But it's not on tribal land, is it?

MR. MQRISSET:

No, but it’s a tribal right, it's

a tribal right, as is all off-reservation, usual and
accustomed, hunting and fishing rights.

It’s a tribal resource,

it seems to.me, your Honor, just as important as the land that's
on the reservation.

This is a resource.

It is a right,

property right, if you want to call it that, of the tribe,
something they should be allowed to control for their members.
And Judge Bolt in U.S. v. Washington has so held
that the Indian tribes can regulate that right and the Ninth
Circuit has just recently held about two weeks ago that the

18
Indian tribes should have the right to regulate hunting and
fishing, not on the reservation, but in areas that are usual
and accustomed places, and we agree with those decisions and
think they make good sense.

They allow the tribes to take care

of their own, to take care of what rights are theirs under
Federal law.
QUESTIONS

I take it non-Indians could hunt in this

sane area consistent with the treaty, couldn’t they?
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

This isn’t a treaty, though.

MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

Subject to State law, yes.

No, this is not —

It was not a treaty after 1871*

This was

a sale.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION;

Act of Congress.

Well, the Act of Congress simply

appropriated money.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

And ratified the agreement of 1391.

In haeo verba?

MR. MORISSET:

Ye s.

QUESTIONS

Indian terms.

QUESTION:

Now, this is the first time you have

made reference to ratification, and you are relying on that?
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:
appropriations.

Yes.

Well, —

Before you made reference only to the

19
MR. MORIS SET:

I thought I said in my opening

remarks that it was ratified in 1906 by the Appropriation let,
I believe I made that statement.
I want to make it clear, however,- that these rights,
these hunting and fishing rights, attached when the reservation
was established, and it. has been the teaching of this Court,
that such rights do not fly away or disappear by implication,
by some strange metaphysical happening in an Act of Congiress.
And the only Act of Congress or only action of Congress which
refers to the rights at all is the 189.1 agreement, and that
agreement, of course, preserves the rights,it does not take
them away.

The 1892 Act makes no mention of the rights

whatsoever.

I believe it's the teaching of this Court in

Menominee, for example, that if no mention is made of hunting
and fishing rights, which are vested in the tribe, then they
are not impaired or abrogated or taken away.

And that’s good

teaching, and I would hope that we can stand by that.
So our position, to summarise, is that the promise
was absolute in its terms, does not give the State any power
or control whatsoever.
In the alternative, arguendo, if there is any State
power following a Puyallup kind of reasoning that the State
has some authority to regulate, as necessary for conservation —
I want to make it clear we don’t accept that in this- case ~~
nevertheless, they have made no case for conservation.

They

20
have done none of the steps that the trial courts, which have
had to try to implement your decisions in Puyallup have come
up with, such as looking into the regulation ahead of time,
considering the Indian needs as a special need and making
special provision for that.

The State has done nothing of

that kind in this case and, I think

it would be clear that

this particular regulation which Alex Antoine is considered
to have violated was not done as necessary for conservation,
as that term has come to mean in terms of Indian rights, but
was done as a total State political allocation regulation.
I wish to .reserve the rest of my time, Mr. Chief
Justice, for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Morisret.

Mr. Coniff.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH LAWRENCE CONIFF, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. CONIFF:
Court:

Mr. Chief Ju3ti.ce, and Members of the

I wish to first advise the Court that I ara appearing

here today on behalf of the prosecuting attorney of Ferry
County; inasmuch as Mr. Morisset and I tried the case, I was
appointed as a special deputy prosecuting attorney to handle
the matter.
There was a question raised by Justice Blackmun, I
believe, regarding the status of Mrs. Irene Antoine, and I
think it should be pointed out to the Court that at the trial

21
of the case, as was reflected in the statement of facts, page 5 ,
that only Hr. Alexander Antoine was present at the trial.
Now, the findings, the argument and the findings referred to
by Justice Blackrnun would therefore indicate that Mrs. Antoine
is not a party to the case.

I cannot comment upon the reason

why she has been added in this appeal, inasmuch as the
appellants have done so.
QUESTION:

Perhaps '

because she was referred to

in the judgment that followed the findings of fact-

and

conclusions of law.
MR, CONIFP:
the judgment.

Yes, I presume so.

I did not prepare

You will note the prosecuting attorney prepared

the judgment, and I was simply sent a copy.

I was unaware

until the court had signed the order —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Coniff, if he could not be

prosecuted, could she, not an enrolled member of the tribe?
MR. CONIFF:

In my opinion, a non-euroIled member

of an- Indian tribe in this particular case, a Canadian Indian,
is fully amenable to State law in exactly the same way as any
other non-member or non-Indian.
QUESTION:

So that a reversal here, if there were

one, would not mean that she would be — no. An affirment
here would not mean necessarily that she couldn’t be
prosecuted.
MR. CONIFF:

I believe that would logically follow,

assuming her status is as is stated in the United States
memorandum as amicus curaie, that is, a non-enrolled member.
QUESTION:

Well, that is stated, too, in her

jurisdictional statement.
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:
MR. CONIFF:

That she is a non-onrclled member.
Was a charge filed against her?
The original charges were filed against

both Fir. and Mrs. Antoine.
QUESTION s
MR. CONIFF:

What did it allege about her?
That she was aiding and abetting —

there were originally two charges filed, one was dismissed.
QUESTION:

So really they would have to prosecute

her -- file another charge if they wanted to prosecute her
because she is charged just as an aider and abetter,
MR. CONIFF:

Yes, inasmuch as these matters are

misdemeanors under the lavs of the State of Washington, the
statute limitations would have run.

So as a matter of

reality —
QUESTION:

If he is found — if he wins here, she

is out of trouble.
MR. CONIFF; She is out of trouble as far as I can
of
see because/the statute of limitations in any event.
QUESTION:

But if ha doesn’t win here, what happens

to her?
MR. CONIFF:

If he does not win here, as far as I

23
can see, she was not present in the judgment entered in the
lower court, could be reopened, I believe, on that ground.
However, again, I would reiterate that I did not prepare or
enter the judgment which is found in the appendix.
QUESTION:

So I take it from your remarks that you

are doubtful on the part of the State as to the integrity of
this judgment against her.
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:
MR. C0N3IFF:

As:to Mrs. Antoine, yes.
This judgment anyway.
Yes, because the statement of facts

does reflect that she was not present at the trial.
QUESTION:

This record would suggest at least the

possibility that that's a jurisdictional matter and that
whether it was raised or not the Court could take notice of
tne absence of jurisdiction over her, could they not?
MR. CONIFF:

Yes, I would submit that would

be the case, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:
' MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:
the

...

a matter of State law?

With regard to my response to —
...

Mrs. Antoine.

With regard to the statute of limitations
Yes.

Also, with regard to the effect of

judgment on her and with respect to whether she would have

to be reprosecuted as an aider and abetter.
MR. CONIFF:

Yes,,

First of all, I would question

24

the jurisdiction of the trial court in the first instance to
render any sort, of a judgment and sentence upon an individual
who is not present.

The appropriate remedy would be, under

those circumstances, I believe, to issue a bench warrant in
the event the person did not appear at the trial,

unless

her attorney might have waived her presence, as is reflected
apparently by stipulation of Mr. Morisset and the local
prosecuting attorney, Mr. Granville Egan.
Again, I am somewhat handicapped on these detail
questions with regard to the entry of the judgment sentence
inasmuch as I was not present at that time and did not draft
them.
QUESTION:

But in any event, I take it you share

in my concern, anyway, about the integrity of the judgment
against her and almost concede that so far as she is
concerned, a reversal is indicated.
MU. CONIFF;

Inasmuch as the court in the first

instance might well lack jurisdiction because of her failure
to appear in the case.
QUESTION:

You are also here, are you not, to

defend the judgment that has been entered by the Supreme Court
of Washington which affirmed the judgment conviction against
her?
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You can leave it to the other side

25

presumably co attack tne judgment,
MR. COMIFF:

Yes.

I would presume that v/ould be true.

However, I was of the impression that Mr. Justice Blackmun
wanted to have whatever information — my comments and whatever
information was available from the record directed to his
attention, and it was for that reason that I shifted gears,
so to speak, and attempted to address myself to that problem.
QUESTION:

Was this point argued to the Supreme

Court of Washington?
MR. CONIFF:

The status of Mrs. Antoine?

Ho, it

was not.
QUESTION:
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:

So they didn't pass on it, did they?
No, they did not, your Honor.
This is unbelievable.

There's a conviction

in absentia approved by the court, approved by the Supreme
Court, and brought here and nobody raised a point about it.
MR. CONIFF:

The appellants did not raise the

question and it was not argued by appellants, and I believe
counsel for appellants has so indicated.

I am simply trying

to be candid with the Court and advise the Court of the
exact record that is before it.
I would point out in further response to the question.
Justice Marshall, that in the single appendix printed by
appellants, page 1G, wherein

the findings are set forth,

it is recited that each defendant personally, their attorney,

26

Mason

Dc

Morisset, and the Assistant Attorney General and the

Prosecuting Attorney all have stipulated,

and &c forth, that

the sentence of the district court, the lower court, below
the superior court, was reasonable, and so forth.

I am not

sure that adds or subtracts to her absence at the trial.
X would like to emphasize to the Court, as has been
referred to by Mr. Morisset, that the status of the lands
upon which the arrest occurred was that of nonallotted lands,
they were not Indian lands, they were in non-Indian ownership.
Tijey are fully subject to State taxation.

And even if the

owner of those lands would engage in the activity of hunting,
he would be required to possess a State hunting license.
So as I understand —
QUESTION:

The question isn't unlicensed hunting,

it's hunting out of season, isn't it?
MR. CONIFF:

Yes, that is correct.

And the owner

of the land would likewise have to comply with that hunting
season regulation, which was promulgated by the Game Commission
of the State of Washington pursuant to statutory delegation
by the legislature.
The first point that I believe should be briefly
discussed involves the 1S71 statute prohibiting the execution
of further treaties.

And in light of this statute, I believe

that the Court must examine very carefully the legal consequences
which might arguably flow from the 1891 agreement with the

27
■tribes and bands of Colville Indian Reservation.

I would

first point, out to the Court that, as was pointed out by the
court below, a plausible interpretation of the exact language
before the Court in articles 1, 5, and 6 of the 1891 agreement
is that article G was intended to secure to the Indian
allottees in the northern half the rights to go upon the
Indian reservation and hunt in common with the Indians on the
diminished or south half of the reservation.

This is further

borne out by the exact language used by the Commissioners who
represented the United Statas in entering into these negotia­
tions in article 1, whereby the Indians "do hereby surrender
and relinquish to the United States all their right, titles,
claim, and interest in and to and over the following described
tract of land."
Secondly, as pointed out in the briefs filed by the
United States as amicus curiae and in the statutes pointed out
by tlie appellants in their brief, there is no showing in tills
record that the Commissioners of the United States had any
authority to enter into a treaty or even that that was what
they intended to accomplish.

Rather, the statute authorizing

the Commissioners to enter into these negotiations indicate
that their purpose was to acquire the land

so that it might

be open for public settlement.
Tliis matter was further brought to the attention of
Congress, as pointed out in the memorandums, which ultimately

28
culminated in the 1392 statute which is found at 27 Stat» 62
and following.

It is the State's position that the 1892 statute

confers jurisdiction upon the State and that it expressly
purports to do so.
In this connection, I vzould further point out to
the Court that the legislative history surrounding the
enactment of the 1892 statute clearly demonstrates that
Congress had before it the precise question of whether or not
to ratify the 1391 agreement.
Representatives did so.

In fact, the House of

The Senate did not concur, and the

matter finally culminated in the exact language of the 1892
statute which, because the critical nature of the State's
position and the reliance upon this statute, I would like to
just very briefly read the precise language employed by
Congress, remembering that the proposed inclusion of a
reservation of fishing and hunting rights, the House version
was rejected by the Senate in favor of this language which
finally did pass Congress.
The statute provides that the northern half be and
is hereby vacated and restored to the public domain, notwith­
standing any executive order or other proceeding whereby the
same was set apart as a reservation for any Indians or bands
of Indians and the same shall be open to settlement and entry
by proclamation of the President of the United States and
shall be disposed of under the general laws applicable to the

29

disposition of public lands in the State of Washington.
QUESTION:

Where in the briefs or record is that,

passage you are reading from.
MR. CONIFF:

I am reading from page 12 of the brief

of appellee, the blue brief.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Coniff, as I understand it, the

agreement of 1091, and then legislation in 1892 which almost
rejected the agreement, or implicitly sc.

At least one

House of Congress thought that the land hadn’t been the
Indians'to sell.

And then a 15-year lobbying effort by the

Indians culminating in the legislation of .1906, is that it?
MR, CONIFF:
QUESTION:

That is my understanding of it.
1391 agreement, 1892 legislation which

was inconsistent with the agreement, and then a 1906 law which
was consistent with the agreement and purported to ratify it.
Is that it?
MR. CONIFF:

A caveat purported to ratify, which

leads to the next leg of my argument.
It is that even if we assume that the 1871 statute
is to be given no effect, which, of course, we do not agree
with that —
QUESTION:

That is the 1371 statute that said no more

treaties with the Indians.
MR. CONIFF:

Prohibited further —■ they said no more

30

treaties.

And if we assume for purposes of argument that the

Commissioners who executed the treaty, purported to execute
the treaty,, the question is whether or not under the
Constitution of the United States, Article IX, section 2,
clause 2, which requires ratification by two-thirds of the
Senators present, whether or not in fact there was a ratifica­
tion legally and constitutionally of the 1G91 agreement.
QUESTION:

Well, an agreement need not be a treaty.

The Government can make an agreement with you; it’s not a
treaty, it’s vis-a-vis your land, and in that agreement for
the purchase of your land, it can give you certain remaining
rights in it, like the right to hunt or fish, even though it
will now belong to the Government,

That's not a treaty.

That's just a purchase.
MR. CONIFF:

It could be — I think we must be

careful to distinguish between the question of dealing with
the police powers of the State, the State of Washington being
admitted into the Union in 1889, presumably coming into the
Union on an equal footing with sister States, and to distinguish
between the rights of government or reserved police power, if
you will, the right to regulate the hunting activities over
the land in question, and the right in the nature of an easement,
the right to go upon other's land and hunt does not deal with
the subject matter of the right of the State to govern or
the right of the State to apply the laws in question to the

31

Indians in the extinguished northern half.
QUESTIONi
the Government

1 suppose vour position would be that if

(inaudible)

State had allowed homesteading

of certain lands that it owns and ultimately passed it into
private hands through a patent, that the Federal Government
couldn’t accompany that patent by a guarantee to the homesteaders
that they would never be subject to the police powers of the
State of Washington.
HR. CONIFF;

That is correct, Mr. Justice Relinquish,,

that is my position.
I would further, in support, while we are on this
subject generally of ratification, Mr, Justice Stewart, I would
like to further respond to your query by pointing out that the
precise language employed by Congress in the 1906 Appropriation
Act itself states that its purpose v;as to authorize payment
to the Indians in order to carry into effect the agreement of
1831.

And the exact language employed by Congress, I would

submit, would support the conclusion that it demonstrates
Congressional intention simply to pay for the lands acquired.
(

I would further submit that the language cited by the Federal
Government in their amicus brief, the comments of Justice
Fullerton, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the
who
State of Washington,/was one of the Commissioners who dealt
with the Colville Indians, dealt solely with the question of
obtaining compensation from Congress for the payment for the

32
taking, if you will, or 'the opening of the northern half lands.
It is our position that the subsequent 1906 and
following Appropriation Acts which are set forth in our
memorandum, our brief, do not purport* to ratify in a constitu­
tional sense of ratification the 1891 agreement.

It is our

position that similar to the position, intarestly, taken by
the Department of the Interior when these matters were called
to Congress' attention in 1906, that the Indians simply had
— that the Indians did have a possessory right to the northern
half and that they should be compensated for it.

The reason,

apparently, that Congress was dragging its feet was that they
weren't sure as to whether the Indians even had a possessory
interest in the northern half of the reservation due to the
fact it was created pursuant to an executive order and not
pursuant to treaty.
QUESTION:

That had divided the two Houses of

Congress, I think, in 1892.
MR. CONIFP;

Yes.

The reading of the legislative

history in that regard, it seemed to me, could lead to that
conclusion.
I would further point out that the 1832 statute
which ceded jurisdiction clearly in our view to the State of
Washington has never been: modified or repealed.

And in this

connection, I would point out that the Constitution of the
United States, Article I, section 8, clause 16, provides that

33

the jurisdiction of a State once acquired can only be retro­
ceded with the consent of the State legislature.

And there is

no showing in this record, and in fact the legislature has not
purported to retrocede to the Federal Government jurisdiction
over the northern half.

In fact, what appellants seem to be

arguing is that the State should be deprived of the jurisdiction
which it acquired in 1892 by implication from an agreement
executed for the purchase of the land from the Indian tribes
in 1891.

We would submit that a State should not be deprived

of its jurisdiction to enfox'ca its laws upon all citizens
equally upon the land in question, i.e., the former northern
half, upon such a showing.

The prior decisions of this Court

appear to be quite uniform in articulating this rationale.
I would further point out that the suggestion which
is made in both the Federal Government's amicus brief and in
the brief of appellants, that Public Law 280 somehow comes into
play in this case,is spurious

—

QUESTION: What comes into play?
MR. CONIFF:

Public Lav/ 200, which is the State’s

assumption of jurisdiction over Indian reservations as was
enacted by Congress in 1953 and became effective in August 1953.
Our position simply is that Public Law 280 does not
apply because the northern half was not an Indian reservation,
quote unquote, as of the date of the enactment.

Therefore, by

its terms it does not apply to the northern, the extinguished

34
northern, half of the Colville Indian Reservation-

And there­

fore , the Menominee decision of this Court, the companion case
to Puyallup I,simply does not apply, Menominee, of course,
dealt with the express termination of a treaty tribe, and, of
course, the situation is dramatically different here where, in
other words, the Indian country concept — in this opinion
written by Justice Douglas, the Indian country concept was
clearly set forth, that the lands must occupy their unique
status as Indian country, an Indian reservation, in order at
the time of the enactment of Public Law 380 in order for its
terms to be applicable.

And the Court in a unanimous opinion

was very careful to make that distinction.
I would like to further point out that in subsequent
congressional treatment of the northern half, the extinguished
northern half, of the Colville Indian Reservation, has uniformly
dealt with it as if it were extinguished.

The precise

congressional statutes are set forth in our memorandum.

This

subsequent congressional treatment is reflected in several
opinions of this Court.

X specifically refer the Court to

United States v. Pelican, which is found at 232 U.S. and I'm
reading at page 446, a very short sentence, which I believe
is on this points
"In dealing with the question of the Northern Half,
the evident purpose of Congress was to carve out of the portion
of the reservation restored to the public domain the lands to

35
be allotted and reserved as stated and to make the restoration
effective only as to the residue.

The.vacation and restoration

which the statute accomplished, section 1, was thus", and so
forth,"made subject to the reservation and allotments of land
in severalty."
Now, as I’ve mentioned, the stipulated facts, the
facts that were stipulated by Mr, Morisset and I at the original
?
trial of this matter in Republic, Washington, indicate that
the offense occurred on non-allotted, non-Indian land.

So that

we are not dealing with an allotment remaining in the Northern
Half in this case.
QUESTION:

The provision of the Federal Constitution

you referred to which you said limited the right

of Congress

to impair any right of the State after 1839.
MR. CONIFF:

With regard to the jurisdictional

argument, it was article I, section 8, clause 16, and I submitted
to the Court that the decisions of this Court construing this
constitutional provision make it clear that once the jurisdiction
of a State vests or is acquired, that it can only be retroceded
to the United States with the express consent of the State
legislature.

The cases referred to are James v. Dravis Construc­

tion Company and Fort Leavenworth Railway v. Lowe, which are
cited in the brief of appellants.
There are two other decisions of this Court subsequent
to the Pelican decision which expressly recognized the diminishment

36
if you will, and the ex t ingu i shirtent of the Northern half and
the diminisAuuent of the size of the Colville Indian Reservation
to its present size, which is approximately one-half of its
original size»

As. the Court is aware the original boundaries

extended to the 49th parallel and bounded with the nation of
Canada.

Thi3 is, by the way, reflected by State*s Exhibit No.. lf

a copy of which is in the record and is available for the
Court's inspection.

State's Exhibit No. 1 likewise, by a

red X, locates the precise location of the offense as being
on non-Indian, non-allotted land again and not within the
boundaries of a national forest.
QUESTION:

Privately owned by a non-Indian presumably»

Is that right?
MR. CQNIFF:

Yes, it is.

Privately owned, non-

allotted, non-Indian land, and the raap, State's Exhibit No. 1,
indicates that the locus delicti is not within the boundaries
of a national forest.
Now, I've gone a little further than that,as the
Court is aware, in terms of the motion to strike and further
reply brief to this new issue which was interjected three or
four weeks ago when I received a copy of the Federal Govern­
ment's brief as amicus.
to their argument.

I could respond just very briefly

Their position appears to be that to

the extent that the extinguished northern half is a national
forest, the Indians at least have this much room, or this much

37
at least free from any State jurisdiction or State authority
to apply the hunting laws in question.

And I would 3ubmit

that this position is erroneous for several reasons.
First of all* as X have previously indicated, the
locus delicti is not within national forest boundaries.
Secondly, the establishment of local forests occurred
after the acceptance of jurisdiction by the State.

As pointed

out the Colville National Forest was established by
Presidential proclamation in 1907.

And, further, the statutes

by which the national forests of the United States are
established, as set forth in page 3 of the orange reply brief,
indicate that the jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, over
persons within such national forests shall not be affected or
changed by reason of the existence of such reservation, and so
on.

It says the State wherein any such national forest is

situated shall not,by reason of the establishment thereof,
lose its jurisdiction, nor the inhabitants thereof their rights
and privileges as citizens of the State, which is
presently codified in 16 U.S.C. 430 and has been construed
definitively by this Court in Wilson v. Cook , as set forth
in the brief.
The Federal Government .likewise appears to argue,
as do the appellants, that somehow the Indians were nearby
a national forest and were somehow acting pursuant to some
sort of Federal statutory authority

enjoyed by representatives

38

of the Department of the Interior or the National Forest
Service.

The case authority cited for this proposition# in

our view# does not apply to the. case at bar. We do net have,
a situation present in this case as was presented to this
Court in Hunt \y. United States wherein Federal officials were
killing deer contrary to State lav; where there was a showing
that the deer were in fact doing damage to publicly owned
lands5. in that case a national park.
QUESTION;

So in sum the facts of this indicate clearly that

the Indians were not acting here as agents of the Federal
Government, nor that their activities in killing the deer out
of season were necessary for the protection of

boundaries of a national forest.

proceeding by the amicus brief of the United States.

It's in a rather cryptic form, I gather.
MR. CONIFF:
QUESTION:

I didn't really understand it to be

making the argument.
MR. CONIFF:

Finally, just to summarise, I would like

to further point out that this Court subsequent to the Pelican
decision in Seymour v. Superintendent

has expressly recognised

the legal effect of the 1892 statute I referred to with the
following language.
"In

I'ra reading from 368 U.S. at page 354.

1892 the size of this reservation was diminished when

Congress passed an Act providing that, subject to reservations
and allotments made to individual Colville Indians, about one-

40

half of the original Colville Reservation,since commonly
referred to as the North. Half, should be vacated and restored
to the public domain."
The Court goes on to observe this Act did not,
however, purport to affect the status of the remaining part of
the reservation since known as the South Half.
Finally, in this same vein, I'd like to refer to
the Matts v. Arnett decision which was written by Justice
Blackanun on October 10, 1972, read very briefly from page 412
U.S. at page 504, footnote 22.

Here the Court unanimously was
?

?

reaching a conclusion that the Hoopa and Urark Indians of
California, that their reservations in the corridor along the
river between the two had never been expressly dealt with or
terminated by Congress.

And in reaching this conclusion, the

Court contrasted, made the point that where Congress desired to
specifically extinguish or to terminate an Indian reservation,
it clearly was capable of doing so with ..express language.

And

in support of that proposition, the Court states unanimously
that Congress has used clear language of express termination
when that result is desired.

See, for example, 27 Stat. 63

(1892), the 1392 statute adopted just two weeks after the
1392 with which this case is concerned, providing that the
North Half of the Colville Indian Reservation, "the same being
a portion of the Colville Indian Reservation be

and is hereby

vacated and restored to the public domain," and citing with

41

approval the Seymour v. Superintendent

MR. CONIFF:

MR. CONIFF:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

And if you've looked at

I think without exception, are all wrong.

So that the index,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Morisset, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MASON D. MORISSET
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

Just briefly.

Mr. Morisset, before you get started,

is it agreed that this offense occurred on privately owned
land?
MR. MORISSET:

We are not sure if it is privately

owned, but it certainly is not State land nor Federal land nor

42
an Indian allotment of any kind,
QUESTION:

Right.

MR, MORISSET:

That probably leaves only privately

owned land.
QUESTION:

But if it. were privately owned, your

position would be the same.
MR, MORISSET:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now, there is a statement in the Supreme

Court of Washington's opinion to the effect that if privately
owned land had been fenced, then there would have been no
question of the right of that private owner to forbid Indians
from hunting on it.
United States?

Is that the lav/ of Washington and the

Do you agree with that?

MR. MORISSET:

I think that's dicta in the State

court's opinion, and I disagree completely.

This Court held

in Wlnans that when a Federa3. law of some kind guaranteed
hunting and fishing rights to Indians, they at least in that
case had a right of entry across a patented

.u property,

a fee piece of property, to get to their usual and accustomed
place.
QUESTION;

Well, that was fishing, that was to get

The stream didn't belong to the private owner.

But here the land on which the deer was shot and killed did
belong to the private owner, it was on his land, and certainly
is it your submission that the State of Washington can't

43
even enforce its ordinary trespass laws against Indians?
MR, MORISSET:

Well, that's a different case, of

course.
QUESTION:

Well, that is this case, isn’t it?

MR. MORISSET:

Well, it could be this case*

That

And ray answer would be

that it could not if the facts were somewhat similar to
VJinana.

That is, an Indian was not disturbing the peace, was

not endangering a farmer’s crop or his wife and children or his
cows, was simply trying to get across the land or was in an
open field —
QUESTION:
somewhere else.

We are not crossing the land to get to

He is hunting a deer on this land and killing

it on the land and he is shooting off a gun in the land and
therefore presumably at least hypothetically, he may be
endangering other people.
MR.

MORISSET:

two answers to that.

That’s possible.

I think there are

One, I don't think that the Confederated

Tribes will exercise this right in that way.

I think that we

have to, of course, be concerned with the outer reaches of
any behavior.

But I don't think as a practical matter the

Indians are going to exercise a right to endanger others.
Secondly,

if it should come to that, I think there

is a point at which the Indian is not1 engaged in hunting as it
was contemplated by the agreement, and as is contemplated today

,

by hunting statutes.

44

A person, a white man, can be hunting,

have a license, be within State law, bat if he goes too far
and runs into sortie other police power law, he can still be
found guilty of that.

And I thin): the same principle would

apply here.
QUESTION:
that?

Going too far?

What kind of crime is

What specifically?
MR. M.OFISSBT;

No, of departing from hunting and

engaging in some activity which endangers the public peace.
Let me give a simple example.

I third-, that an

Indian would be bound not to shoot across a public highway
in the exercise of his hunting rights, because the State there
is not trying to stop him from hunting per se, is not allocating
the resource as it is trying to do here, it’s trying to
preserve the public peace.

And if he insists on shooting

across a public highway, that really isn’t hunting as it was
guaranteed by this agreement.

It’s something else.

And I

don’t think that any responsible Indian tribe would try to
defend that kind of behavior.
QUESTION:

Most States that I am familiar with, Mr.

Mcriseit, allow posting, that is a private landowner can
say, even though you’ve got a hunting license, even though
it’s hunting season, you can’t hunt, on the land that I
privately own.

Now, would you say that this private landowner,

if that is in fact where this took place, can’t say that to a

Colville tribe?

QUESTION”.

X think if the facts were similar ■—

Yes or no.

MR. MORISSET:

I can't answer it yes or no, because

it's a difficult fact law question, as it was in Winans.

If

that barred every member of the tribe from getting to an
aboriginal and usual and accustomed hunting place, if there
were no way to get up the valley other than to cross that
farmer's land, I would say that farmer does not have that
right.

He took the fee patent subject to the rights of the

Indians to cross his land.

lie doesn't have a right on his way to

Am I right?

QUESTION;

He shoots the deer on this land, not to

be passed over it.
MR. MORISSET:

I understand that.

He would have a

right to pass over certainly, and I think he would have a right
to shoot the deer if he did not endanger that person's property
or life.
QUESTION;

Even though it was posted.

MR. MORISSET:

Yes.

Yes,

There is nothing in the

agreement or in the Federal lav/ that says that the patents will
be issued not subject to this agreement.
QUESTION:

Suppose it was fenced arid posted,"

the

private land, you could still climb over the fence and shoot

46
a deer.
MR. MORISSET:

Nothing in the agreement says that

this will apply only to unclaimed, or unposted lands.

It says

all usual and accustomed places.

It was not on forest land, Mr. Justice

Douglas, as far as we know, no.

It does not appear that way

in the maps.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record that shown

what the deer population in this area is?
MR. MORISSET:

No, there is nothing.

My own personal

knowledge is that it varies greatly from year to year.

Some

years it’s down, some years it's up.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MR. MORISSET:

And the Indians themselves are concerned,

of course, about the resource.
QUESTION:

Has there been a case before involving

this kind of language in anything other than a treaty?
other cases all involve treaties.

The

Nov;, it’s common ground, I

gather, that this, whatever it is, is not a treaty.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:
before involving —

That’s correct, your Honor.

Now, has there been a case in this Court

47
HR. MORISSET:

To my knowledge , there is no case

involving an Act of Congress as to this particular point,, this
particular kind of right.

I may be incorrect in that, I'm not

really sure..
QUESTION:

It's not this particular kind of right.

The same language, or similar language, might purportedly
create the same right in a treaty, but this is not a treaty.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And my question is has any previous case

in this Court dealt with some such language in a —
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

Act of Congress,

Or in a purchase and sale agreement.

MR. MORISSET:

Not that I am aware of, although

there have been other purchases and sales subsequent to 1871,
and those purchases and sales have reserved rights and there
may ba similar cases.

But I don't know them.

I see my time is up.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is that an Indian

in the category of Ms;. Antoine has a greater right to hunt in
this area than a non-Indian citizen of the State of Washington
with a license.
MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

lie derives that right because it in fact

existed before the Government ever issued a patent on that
land to anyone.

48

MR. MORI3SET;
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Exactly right.

Well, that alone you are not relying on.

You have to rely on the language, don't you,of the 1889
MR. MORISSETs

I am relying on the reservation of

the right in 1872 and the fact it has never been taken away,
has never been mentioned except in the 1891 agreement, and there
it is reserved, not taken away.
QUESTION:

Aren't you relying on the language of the

1891 agreement?
MR. MORISSETs

Yes, but I want to make it clear the

right does not fall completely if we completely take away the
1891 agreement, because it pre-existed that agreement.

It was

simply reserved by that agreement.
QUESTION:

If there hadn't been any such language

and if there had been simply the 1906 legislation, would you
have the same case?
MR. MORISSETs

The 1906 legislation refers only to

the 189.1 agreement.
QUESTION:

Right,

tod if there had been no such

language in the agreement, would you have the same case or any
kind of a case at all?
MR. MORISSETs
QUESTION:

We would certainly —

All the 1906 legislation did was to

authorize installments of $300,000 each.
MR. MORISSETs

1906 authorized the appropriation.

The

49
1907 Act authorised $300,000 apiece.
Assume there is no 1891 agreement at all, we still
have the problem that the rights were vested in the trite by
the establishment of a reservation, and we find nowhere that
the rights have been taken away.
QUESTION:

So my position —•

When they sold the land, didn't they sell

everything that went with it in the absence of the language
on which you rely?
MR. MORISSET:

Wall, that goes more to the

disestablishment question, and this Court has held that in
many cases where tribes have been terminated, reservations
have been terminated, that the hunting and fishing rights
continues unless the Congress explicitly says, "We take that
away."

And I, of course, agree with those rulings of the

Court.

I think they are valid.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
