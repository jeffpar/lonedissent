P R O C E E n I N G S
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Me will hear arguments

next in 73-776, Schlesinger against Ballard,,
Mrs, Shapiro, yon nay proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S, SIIAPIRO ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on direct appeal by the government
from the judgment of a three-judge district court in the
Southern District of California.

The court enjoined the

Navy's discharge of Lieutenant Ballard, and declared the
statute requiring his discharge unconstitutional.
Lieutenant Ballard claims, and the court below found,
that the Navy’s basic separation statute discriminates against
men in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
That statute requires Lieutenant Ballard's discharge
because he was twice passed over for promotion, although he
had less than ten full years of commissioned service.
A special statute, applicable to certain v/omen
lieutenants, provides for their discharge after thirteen
years of service if they’re not selected for promotion.
This three-year difference is the basis of the
claim of discrimination,
I think it's important to point out in the first

A

place that the different treatment doesn't turn simply on sex.
In the

Corps where women and men fill substantially the same

types of jobs, for instance, the Judqe Advocate General Corps,
the Medical Corps, and the Dental Corps, all officers are
subject to the basic statute requiring separation if they are
twice passed over for promotion.
Similarly, nurses, men and women, are subject to a
thirteen-year statute similar to the one that applies to the
line lieutenants.
The special tinirteen-year statute applies to women
line lieutenants and certain staff women.

These women are

competing for jobs against men line lieutenants, but the
statute provides that women may not serve on naval vessels,
except hospital ships and transport ships»
Therefore, the jobs that the women are subject to a
special statute may fill are significantly different than the
jobs that are filled

many of the jobs that are filled by

the men line lieutenants,
QUESTIONS

I take it, we judge this case assuming

the validity of that statutory restriction?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Yes.

I believe that's — that is

not basically in this case.
Both the special thirteen-year statute and the basic
statute providing for separation after being twice passed over
reflect the special military philosophy.

5

In civilian life, if you’re reasonably good at
your job, you can normally expect to keep it even if you're
not promoted.

But in the military, that sort of competence

is not enough.
Instead, in the military, every officer is periodically
compared with his peers*

Those best qualified are promoted,

the others are separated.
This is a very tough system, but it was developed
after World War II to meet the special military need to have
the best possible officers available for command.
QUESTION:

Mrs, Shapiro, are some male officers

ineligible for sea duty?
MRS, SHAPIROs
QUESTION:

Mo, —

And not eligible for other things?

MRS, SHAPIRO:

— there are limited-service

officers, limited-duty officers who are not eligible for
command at sea.
QUESTION: So they are disadvantaged by the existing
system, then?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Not necessarily.

They can serve on

board ships, but they can't command ships.
On the other hand, women can't serve on board ships
at all.

Except hospital or transport ships, yes.
QUESTION:

Would you have felt any differently if

the court below had declared 6401 unconstitutional instead of

6

the general statute?
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

As a —

Would you be here today?

MRS» SHAPIRO;

As a practical matter, I am not sure

that the Navy would have felt nearly as upset about it.

For

one thing, the Navy has proposed to Congress that the special
6401 statute is no longer necessary, in light of current
conditions, under —
QUESTION:

Is that the younger of the two statutes,

the most recent, more recent?
MRS. SII7\.PIRO:

Yes.

Not by very much, but slightly.

Lieutenant Ballard claims that he is not challenging
the basic up or out procedures, but, in attacking the Navy's
authority to discharge him after he has been passed over tv/ice,
he is attacking the procedures, since prompt separation is
important to the effective functioning of the procedures,
And this is no less true because a different rule applies to
a particular small group of officers whose special circumstances
justify this different treatment.
QUESTION;

Why isn't the up or out rule good for

the women?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the up or out rule does apply

to certain women, and it applies — the up or out rule does
apply to women.

The only difference is that out doesn't

occur after two pass-overs, it occurs after thirteen years.

7

It's basically the sane —
QUESTION;

Why isn’t the out rule good for women,

too?
MRS. SIIAPIRO;

Well, the out rule applies to women,

it just doesn't apply as rapidly —
QUESTION;

Hut it doesn't apply to the other.

MRS. SIIAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Pardon?

Why do you have to — you say that this

is a very good rule for the men.
"as good a rule" for women?
MRS, SIIAPIRO:

Well, why isn't it, quote,

Unquote,
Well, there are several reasons.

One of the reasons is that these women — the women that are
affected by it are a relatively small group. They are at a
disadvantage in competing with men in the group for sea duty,
QUESTION:

And that disadvantage is brought about

by the Navy, the same group that made the up and out rule.
MRS; SIIAPIRO:

Well, it's brought about by the

statute, which prohibits them from serving on ships, on
combat ships.
QUESTION:

The same thing»

You can't separate the

Navy from — Congress controls the Navy,
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Well, that's true, but the -- as I

say, I don't believe that the statute prohibiting women from
serving on combat ships is really in this case,
QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't you put the out —

8

what is it — the up or out rule on women?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Well, you could.

Congress doesn't prohibit that.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, Congress says that no -- that

women shall not be discharged until after thirteen years of
service, if they're not on a promotion list*
QUESTION: Well, in order to conform to Congress, why
didn't you say that Navy people who are subject to sea duty
shall up or out?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

You mean why doesn’t the Navy say

that?
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh,

Instead of making it male and female,
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the Congress lias said that

the —
QUESTION:

I don't think that — couldn't the Navy

say that all people subject to sea duty shall either qualify
twice or get out?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

I don't believe the Navy could say

that in light of the current statutes,.

Congress could say

that.
QUESTION:

You don't think the Navy could?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

QUESTION: Why not?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, because Section 6382

9
QUESTION:

Well, the Havy has said it, so far as

the women are concerned,
I think I'm arguing just words, I think that's my
only point.
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

The problem in the case, Mr. Justice

Marshall, is that 0382(a) provides that male officers and
women -- well, actually, it provides that all officers
except women appointed under Section 5590, —
QUESTION s Right.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

— are — must be separated after

they have twice failed of selection.
QUESTIONS
around that.

There's nothing the Navy could do to get

That's the only point I'm trying to get.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTIOHs

Ho.

That’s — that system ~

So the only way that can be corrected

is to go against the statute itself.
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

That's what I was trying to get at.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes,

Sorry.

The basic procedures are those designed by Congress
to assure the selection of the best-qualified officers for
military command.

This is exactly the kind of congressional

choice that is entitled to great deference, since it is so
closely related to the Navy's ability to fight effectively.
The basic rule requiring the separation of officers

10

who have been twice passed over for pronotion is not, as the
court below believed, basically a fiscal or administrative
provision.

Instead, it’s a means of assuring the high quality

of the pool from which eligible officers are chosen.
All officers eligible for promotion are annually
evaluated against their peers.

The best are promoted, but the

quality of the pool from which future officers must be
selected must also be protected.
Therefore, those officers who have served long enough
to show that they are not qualified for promotion must be
weeded out.

In that way there's additional space in the pool

for new officers to enter.

They replace not only the best,

but also the least qualified.
In other words, the effect of the true pass-over
procedure, or the prompt separation of those not selected for
promotion, is that you don't just skim the cream off of the
eligible pool, but you also take off the bottom layer, so
that the quality of the pool remains constant*
Congress has defined the point at which this weeding
out —
QUESTION;

Mrs, Shapiro, —

MRS* SIIAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Yes?

— what percentage of lieutenants are

passed over twice these days, and come out as lieutenants?
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, approximately 15 to 30 percent.

11

The promotion rate is about 85, 70 to 85 percent.
QUESTION:

Up to lieutenant commander.

MRS . SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

P ardon ?

To lieutenant commander.

MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Yes, this is from lieutenant to

lieutenant commander.
The point at which the weeding out occurs is defined
in two different ways.

The basic provision applies to most

officers, including unrestricted line officers, and to men
and women in most of the staff corps.

It requires separation

after the officer has been twice passed over.
That's not a statute that operates as the district
court believed on the turn of the calendar.

The determina­

tion of when an officer has been passed over involves the
exercise of a very substantial military judgment, since
being passed over does not mean simply that an officer was
eligible for promotion, but was not selected; instead, it
means that he's served long enough so that the fact that he
is not selected should be counted against him.
The determination of when that point occurs is a
very complex one.

It requires balancing the varying needs

of the service for officers, the manpower needs from year to
year, and the desirability of having a large enough group
from which to select the officers against the need to treat
the — what people — equally from year to year.

12

Thera really are two important points in this
procedure»

As the need for combat officers increases in

national emergencies, the length of service before promotion
decreases.

That length is currently about nine years as

opposed to the peacetime goal of twelve years.
Secondly, the increased need for officers places a
heavier drain on the pool of officers eligible for promotion,
and makes it increasingly important to assure the high quality
of the pool.

One way of doing that is by the prompt separation

of those passed over.
Since the current promotion rate is 70 to 85 percent,
those who, like Lieutenant Ballard, are passed over twice are
less qualified than 70 to 85 percent of their peers.

Their

separation improves the quality of the pool by making spaces
in the pool available to others who have not yet been
evaluated*'
The effect of the decision below is to delay the
separation of these least qualified officers for about three
years*

Since about two hundred lieutenants, subject to the

basic rule, are passed over for the second time each year, the
potential effect of the decision, under current conditions,
would be that about six hundred such officers would have to be
retained in the pool of eligible lieutenants*
That means, again, that about nineteen hundred
officers in the lower grades, who have not been evaluated,

13

would have to be separated.
Of course, if the conditions change so that the
length of -- the normal length of service is shorter, or
that the promotion rates drop, then the number of officers,
and the deleterious effect on the pool, would be increased.
In any event, the pool of eligible officers is
permanently degraded, and the caliber of officers at all
higher levels inevitably suffers.
The thirteen~year rule which is, as I have noted,
applicable to certain women officers, was intended to provide
for them lengths of service roughly equivalent to those
anticipated for the vast majority of officers under peacetime
conditions.
QUESTION:

Nov/, when you're talking about

officers, are you talking about lieutenants, or all
commissioned officers?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Lieutenants.

MRS* SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I'm talking about lieutenants, yes.

Navy lieutenants*

MRS. SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Lieutenants, yes, I'm sorry.

Navy lieutenants, that's right.

Incidentally, is the ratio of the female

lieutenants to female lieutenant commanders about the same
as male to male in both those categories?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

There are less women lieutenant

14

commanders — the ratio is lower# yes.
The thirteen-year rule does interfere with the
operation of the basic system# since it requires the retention
of a few officers who would otherwise be separated.

But the

effect is not as serious in the female line officer category
as it would be if it were applied to all naval lieutenants
now subject to the basic rule.
First# the absolute numbers involved are far smaller.
In 1972# the year in which Lieutenant Ballard was passed over
for the second time# fourteen women officers wexe held over
simply because of the special thirteen-year statute#
QUESTION:

Even though they had been passed over —

MBS* SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Passed over twice# yes#

— for promotion twice?

MRS, SHAPIRO:

That's right.

And# in comparison, 230 — well# 238 male lieutenants
were passed over for the second time# except for a few of those
who were retained because they were close to retirement# were
separated out.
QUESTION:

But in peacetime they# too# would have

stayed on for almost thirteen years?
MRS* SHAPIRO:

Yes*

If this —

QUESTION: Well# that would have been predicted
average.
MRS# SHAPIRO:

That's the normal peacetime --

15

QUESTION :

There's nothing statutory about that,

that was just the predicted average time.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the statute says that the

normal length of service should be twelve years, and this
is the peacetime goal,
QUESTION; Well, actually, is that the statute that's
been suspended by the Executive Order?
MRS» SHAPIRO;

The eligibility statute has been

suspended by the Executive Order,
QUESTION;

Well, does that have a relation to this

problem?
MRS« SHAPIRO;

Yes,

Yes.

QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION;

How could a lieutenant be so close to

retirement?

Well, he would have been a mustang,

MRS. SHAPIRO;

I guess.

Well, as a matter of fact,

Lieutenant Ballard, the real — I think the real reason that
Lieutenant Ballard is so anxious to remain in service —
QUESTION;

Is to get his retirement.

MRS» SHAPIRO;

■— is because he was -- did have

enlisted service.
QUESTION;

He had enlisted service.

MRS, SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Unh-hunh.
Does the Army and the Air Force have

16

similar differences in their selection out procedures as
between male and female?
MRS* SIIAPIROj

No, they don't.

On the other hand,

their selection out procedures are somewhat different, because
both the Army and the Air Force operate on a two-level system.
That is, you're promoted in temporary grades, and if you’re
selected out in the temporary grade, then you revert to the
permanent grade and you're not separated until you have been
separated and — passed over in the permanent grade.
So that you ~~ if Lieutenant Rallard were in the Army
or the Air Force, he would still be in service.

He would

revert to his permanent grade rather than to his temporary
grade.
There are justifications for permitting these female
officers to serve a few years longer than their male
counterparts who have been twice passed over.
First, the special thirteen-year rule permits the
retention for a few years of women who would otherwise be
separated.

It thus helps to improve the proportion offwomen

officers in the Havy; since there are over twenty times as
many male officers as female officers, this serves a
reasonable legislative purpose.
QUESTION:

You're not arguing that their retention,

however, should be subject to any different rules than men,
should they?

Other than this one,

I mean, in terms of quality.

17

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTIONs

No, this — at least this *—

You could just quit passing them over,

you could always keep

them.

MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Yes.

I'm not sure that that would

be a wise policy.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it that your goals — that

all the Navy's goals but one could be accomplished by saying
women are subject to the same rule as men; namely, out if
you're passed over twice.

And to save one is that you want

to increase the number of women in the -MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

Well, as far as the Navy's

goals, perhaps, the other —
QUESTION:

Well, you could solve the fact of having

an over-supply of lieutenants by simply making the women and
the men subject to the same rule.
MRS, SHAPIRO;
solve that problem.
QUESTION:

Yes, that's right.

That would

But —
And that would put that part of the

argument all aside.
But that would still leave the question of whether
— of whether it's a justification for the difference to want
more women in the Navy.
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Well, the other justification relates

to considerations of fairness to the women involved.

They've

-— promotion rates for women have been significantly slower

18

than for men, and promotion opportunities more limited.
This was the case until — certainly until 1967*
At that time, many of the statutory restraints applicable to
women were removed.

The Navy has since then speeded up

promotions for women, and finally, in 1972, the length of
service before promotion of women line lieutenants equaled
those of their male counterparts for the very first time.
Nevertheless, the records of the women x^ho x*ere being
retained in 1972, because of the thirteen-year provisions,
made —■ x*ere made while the slox-zer rates prevailed,
QUESTION*

Mrs, Shapiro, —

MRS„ SIIAPIROs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir?

-- x-zhen the thirteen-year statute was

first enacted, was it at that time fairly close to the length
of time that a man had to go to be passed over twice?
MRS, SHAPIRO:

The statute was designed to be

equivalent to the peacetime goals for rtien.

The actual length

of service for men at that time, I don't -- was about the same
as it is now*
QUESTION:

Why was the statute ever passed, then?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, Title 10 includes — when it

was codified in 1947, it included one section that v/as
permanent *— designed for the permanent peacetime military
provisions, and then there are other sections that are
temporary, national emergency type sections. The permanent

19

provisions have never corns into effect. They come into
effect when there are no more reserves in the military.
Finally, the women subject to the thirteen-year
provision still suffer a disadvantage in competition with the
men for the available jobs in the line category.
About forty percent of all the jobs in that category
involve shipboard duty, and women, by statute, can’t fill
these jobs.

Moreover, they compete for the jobs for which

they are qualified with men, and in that competition they
are disadvantaged because their records reflect the lack of
seaboard duty.

And the thirteen-year rule serves to counter­

act these disadvantages to some extent by giving the women
somewhat more job security.
As a matter of policy, the Navy has concluded that
the tliirteen-year rule for women is no longer necessary,
since promotion rates are now equal, and therefore they have
suggested to the Congress that the special rule, 6401, be
eliminated as part of the over-all revision of the military
promotion and separation provisions, which are currently
before Congress.
QUESTION:

Is there any statutory limitation now on

promotions for women in the Navy?

There used to be, back a

generation go, for example, that the -- even the head of the
WAVES was a captain, she didn’t have flag rank, and that was
a matter of statute.

20
MRS. SIIAPIROs

Until 1967,, the highest rank that a

woman could have, I believe, was captain.
QUESTION*

As a matter of statute.

MRS# SHAPIRO:

As a matter of statute.

QUESTION: The highest rank to which a woman could —
which a woman could achieve in the Navy, —
MRS* SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

— was captain.

MRS* SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, that’s no longer true»

There are no limitations?

That is, no

sex limitations*
MRS* SHAPIRO?
QUESTION:

Ho, the only limitation --

Just the limitation on the over-all

number of flag officers, I guess*
MRS, SHAPIRO:

Yes, that’s right*

And of course there

is this limitation on service aboard ship*
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Right.
X'Jhat was that you said about a proposed

new statute?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:
summer*

Hearings were held on it over the

It’s part of an over-all provision — an over-all

revision of the entire military promotion and retirement
provision.
QUESTION: For all services, or just for the Navy?
MRS* SIIAPIRO:

All services.

21

Nevertheless, the difference in treatment of which
Lieutenant Ballard complains may no longer be necessary, and
it may soon be eliminated as a matter of legislative
judgment.
QUESTION; When you say "soon be eliminated", that’s
rather optimistic, isn't it?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Nell, it -— it's probably not this

year.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MRS. SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

The —

Mrs. Shapiro, I think you covered it,

but in your figures on the women, do they include the Medical
and the Nurse Corps?
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

No — the fourteen-year figure -—

the fourteen figure?
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MRS. SIIAPIRO:

No, that includes only the women

that are subject to this special provision.

And it doesn't

include the Nurse Corps, which has got another thirteen-year
provision.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

And in the Nurse Corps — excuse me.
How about the Medical Corps?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

The Medical Corps, the women are

subject to the same two-passover rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES R. KHOURY, JR., ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

MR* KHOURY:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I am Charles Khoxiry, and several years ago when
Lieutenant Ballard came to my office and asked me for help
in this situation, I knew it was a unique case and I was able
to discern, after a short time, that it involved the issue
which is before the Court now:

sex discrimination.

He sought me out because I had been in the Navy for
eleven years, and he knew that.

I graduated from the Naval

23

Academy, that accounts for four of those eleven years, and I
was familiar with the problems that are involved in promotion.
I was familiar with the problems of mustang, and having an
individual who walks into your office and has seventeen years
of active duty, which is creditable towards a twenty-year
retirement, and is about —* and if he were a woman, he would
have ™“ he would be over the top, he’d be able to retire.
And of course this was the overriding issue, this
is the overriding concern, as Mrs, Shapiro stated, for
Lieutenant Ballard.

And it was as simple as that, and is as

simple as that,
QUESTION:

About how many years has he had?

MR, KIIOURY;

Well, right now, at this instant, he

will retire in February of 1975, which is about four months
from not/.
QUESTION:
MR. KIIOURY:

So he will have —
I mean, he would —• and that's

another issue that I x*ant to talk about, as mootness of this
case? but I'm saving that for the end,
QUESTION:

Well, let me see if I get it:

What he

was after was that he be eligible for retirement.
MR. KIIOURY:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And if he were —

And now this lawsuit has accomplished

that for him, or will by February, is that it?
MR, KIIOURY:

Exactly.

Exactly, Your Honor.

24

But let me state what I'm going to talk about,
briefly outline.

I'm going to talk about the rational basis •—

QUESTION;

Mrs. Shapiro tells us the statute is

going to be repealed, you tell us he gets everything he wants;
what are we dealing with here?
MR* KIIOURY;

Sounds like DeFunis, doesn't it?

But, at any rate, —
QUESTION:

I hope not!

[Laughter*]
MR* KIIOURY:

— the relief — I’m going to talk

about whether there is any rational basis to support this
particular statute, and what relief should be granted, and
then, if I'm ready to talk about,why this appeal might be
dismissed*
QUESTION:

Is it your view that the rational basis

test applies?
MR, KIIOURY:

Your Honor, I feel that the compelling

interest test would apply here.

However, we're talking about,

if the Court were to find a rational basis, I feel that that
would also be a compelling interest in this particular
situation,
I feel that there's no reason not to apply a
compelling interest here, because this is not a Kahn vs, Shevin
situation, namely, protective legislation being involved.
QUESTION:

That’s what Kahn v, Shevin was, wasn't it?

25

MR„ KIIOTJRY s

That’s right.

And so I'm not at

all saying — I'm responding to what Mrs. Shapiro said about
a rational basis.
In our brief I talk about compelling interest.
QUESTION:

It’s not a Florida type case, either»

Which is what that was.
MR. KHOURYs

But, at any rate, I agree

I agree

that Kahn is not applicable here.
But, basically, what Mrs. Shapiro is saying is
that because this is going to cause a great problem, there's
a military necessity for doing this.

In other words, it's

the reasoning backward problem.
And this Court has been faced before with situations
where attorneys have said that the courts ~~ if the Court
I

implements this decision

in other words, if the Court finds

something unconstitutional, it’s going to cause a great
problem.

In integration cases, I'm sure that was argued

to the Court, that a great problem would occur in the
implementation of a decision by the Court, namely, that
integration must occur.
And i/hat Mrs. Shapiro is doing is talking about the
relief aspect and then using that -— the difficulty, saying
that there’s going to be difficult relief, and then using
that to say that there’s a compelling military necessity to
continue the same scheme; namely, a separate system for women.

26

and a separate system for men, as far as selection out is
concerned*
And I submit to the Court that we should not confuse
that.

And I also want to talk about the figures that are being

talked about here, is, namely, in the court below the only
people who had the same amount of years as Hr. Ballard did,
or more, were nine; nine people.

That was an affidavit that

was filed by Admiral Forbes, and it's in the Appendix.
So as I —- and of course the court below -QUESTION*

Since you want to talk about figures,

what's your basis of nine based on the number, the total number
of years he was in the Navy?
MR. KIIOURY:

QUESTION: Well, what has that got to do with the
issue in this case?

Honor, —

that right?
MR. KIIOIJRY:

The statute talks —

MR. KIIOURY:

No.

They don't talk about that,
MR. KIIOURY:

No.

Now, —
QUESTION:
me,

I don’t know.
MR. KIIOURY:

You are alleging the class, you tell
How many in that class?
Okay.

The point is that she is trying

to state —
QUESTION: Well, how many are in your class?
MR. KHOURY:

One person,

One person, it's not a

class action.
QUESTION*

Well, how does that become a class?

That’s an awful large person!
MR. KHOURY:

That's exactly right, and that's the

point I'm trying to make, is that we're talking about one
person here, and the government is arguing that we’re going
to bring the, you know, have a whole lot of people, six
hundred people over a period of three years.
QUESTION:

Can you take care of just one without

taking care of the others?
MR. KIIOURY:

Well, that's what I suggest that the

Court do here, is worry about the cases, the class action,
when it comes up.
QUESTION:
one or all?

getting at?
QUESTION!
MR. KIIOURY s

Oh.
In other words, it would be only

those — what the Court did — since the government is talking
about the effect of this, let me talk about what happened
after this.

In other words, a class action was filed, and

the court, the three-judge court below allowed individuals
to opt whether or not to stay in as if

the point I'm trying to make.

That's

And that's

We shouldn't be talking about

figures that have not been subject to trial»
Nov/, ITm going to get to that when I talk about an
improperly presented federal question, because I really
believe that this question has been improperly presented to
this Court.

Last-minute affidavits.

But I want to go on and talk about this idea of
the rationale that the government has put up, saying that they

30

need this statute, this 10 USC 6382, as opposed from 10 -- and
the 10 USC — there's a rational basis for having the different
treatment»

That's what I'm talking about.
We're not questioning the selection out procedures.

I'm talking about the situation where there's a rational basis,
or a compelling interest, to have different treatment for
women as opposed to men.
And they talk about a combat need, in other words, a
tremendous increase of combat individuals.
Well, from my own experience, that whenever you have
an increase — a necessity of getting combat individuals,
the support people are needed.

For every combat individual,

there are three or four individuals who have to support that
individual.

And so this need of — this expanding of the

service cuts across just the males, it cuts across that and
into the women, also.
And, of course, basically all the government is
arguing here is that because this may cause some fiscal
inconvenience to the Navy, some fiscal inconvenience to the
Navy, then that makes it a military necessity, and there is
a compelling interest to have disparate treatment between men
and women.
I want to — we can't argue backwards and say
because it's hard, and it may be hard — and I'm not even
conceding that it is, because, as I was talking to Justice

31

Marshall, we don’t know exactly how many people would opt to
take advantage of the statute that the wonen have, the extra
— the thirteen years.
Lieutenant Dallard obviously is opting to take
advantage of that, because he can retire„

But it's going to

be really a very small number of — and generally mustangs,
as Justice Stewart says, and that's the name that the Navy
uses, individuals who have been enlisted men and then go
into the officer ranks.
And again ~ and I want to respond to this ~~ it

And

And during the period

of the time of the temporary restraining order, he did very
well, and there were additional fitness reports which were
submitted by his command, showing that they recommended him
for promotion every time,
And so it is —
QUESTION;

Does this tie in to your constitutional

argument at all?
MR. KIIOURY:

It talks about the turn of the calendar.

In other words,that this is only a turn of the calendar.
And I'm responding to the government's statement about a lessqualified individual.

But it's correct*

In other words, the

32

constitutional issue is i^hether or not similarly situated
people, whether or not a similarly situated woman has the
better of a situation, and whether a similarly situated man
is discriminated against by a statutory scheme.
QUESTIONs

That's the basis the court below went on.

MR. KIIOURY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And another point that I'm talking about •— that I
want to talk about, that has to do with this constitutional
issue, is the assertion that women are also subject to the
same statute I'm complaining is applied to my man.

And that

was discussed below and evidence was taken below on that
issue, and the court found that no woman had been discharged
under 10 USC 6332.

That's in the court's, the three-judge

court's opinion.
And I wanted to make that perfectly clear, that they
found that in fact no woman had been discharged under this
statute, which the government is saying, well, it really does
apply to some women.

MR. KHOUKY:

That's a possible interpretation.

But getting on to the relief now.

In other words,

we've talked about the fact that there are — there's a
disparate treatment here of men and women similarly situated.
Now, what is the relief?

And that's really what the govern­

ment is complaining about.

That's really what is hurting

the government here, is that they're worried about the
relief.

Not whether or not there is a constitutional

deprivation, because that really has to be clear from the
record, especially when it v/as clear at the time Congress
enacted this thirteen-year statute, that they were just
trying to make it be the same time as men.
clear from the record.

And that's very

That there was never -— that Congress

wasn't attempting any protective legislation or anything of
that nature when they enacted this thirteen-year protective
statute to women.
QUESTION: Why did the custom change with respect to
men, Mr. Khoury?

I take it, it hasn't been a result of

statute, but simply as a result of practice, that gradually

34

the period for men has gone down from thirteen years.
HR, KJIOURY s

Basically, what happened is that a

restriction on time and grade was lifted by an executive
order, a presidential order, and the latest one was signed by
President Johnson in I960, which took away the restriction
that before you used"to have' to be an ensign a certain amount
of time, and then a Lieutenant j » g. a certain amount of time,
before you were even eligible for promotion.
QUESTION;

Was this accurate in the government’s

reply brief, that that suspension was made because suspension
of normal tine and grade provision was *— of these officers
was required in times of national emergency,, and an Executive
Order suspended them as in a time of national emergency? is
that right?
MR# KHOURY?

Basically it says — the suspension

order says this is a national emergency.

One of the affidavits

provided by the government says that we’ve been in a state of
national emergency for some many, many years right now, and
that’s true#
QUESTIONS

Of course, in the Second World War you

had 21-year-old colonels#

They did away with all sorts of time

and grade procedures.
MR# KIIOURY:

And they did away with also the up or

out procedure, too, during that period of time.
Nobody was ratting kicked out during that period of

35

time, due to passovers f because the President has the
authority to suspend all of that.
QUESTION:

But if he does in fact suspend it, so

that you don't have to spend as much tine in grade, doesn’t
it follow, the natural consequence of that, that the
opportunity to judge the man may come up more frequently?
MR, KIIOURY:

The opportunity to judge the man,

he’s still going to he subject to two passovers.

It means

it will come faster, and his total time in service will be
less, maybe by three years, and if he’s like Lieutenant
Ballard, he may, you know, he may not be able to retire.
That's the operative effect of it.

Not necessarily that

he’s going to be observed more at all.
I mean, in the Navy you’re observed once a year,
no matter what, on your fitness reports.

Unless you've

been transferred, and then you may have multiple observations.
QUESTION:

But that your chance to be promoted

from lieutenant would come at a sooner date, by reason of
the Executive Order.
HR, KIIOURY:

That’s right.

And that's what

that's exactly right.
But we must look at what Congress intended, and
we can’t at all say that Congress did not — Congress would
not intend the benefit of the women not be applied to
Lieutenant Ballard in this case,

I mean, how can it be

36

asserted that it would be — that in any way, shape or form
that the court below was wrong in applying the 10 use 6401 to
Lieutenant Ballard to cure the ~~ to grant the relief
requested.
QUESTION: Well, if you're right, the court below
was wrong.

If Congress wouldn't have intended this to apply

to Lieutenant Ballard, they should have enforced the
congressional intent and not declared the statute unconstitu­
tional,
MR. KIIOURY:

Oh, I'm not -— I never said *— I never

asserted, and didn’t mean to give the Court the impression
that it was Congress's intent not to apply 6401 to Lieutenant
Ballard,
In fact, it's very possible that Congress — in
fact, the record shows that it was Congress's intent to
equalize the two services, the two — the male and the female,
when it said thirteen years»

That's conceded by the govern­

ment.
So, in no way, shape or form do I want to state
that it was

that it could be Congress's intent not to give

that benefit.

Because that's — I mean, that's the relief

that was sought, that's the relief that was granted and there’s
nothing in the record that would indicate that Congress's
intent would be other than to have this man get the same
benefit as a woman

37

QUESTION: Nell, but, why on earth do they have to
declare a statute unconstitutional, if you’re right about
Congress’s intent?
MR» KIIOURYs

Well, that's an Executive — that was

an Executive Order in 1960, and the —
QUESTION? Why wouldn't they just hold the Executive
Order was inconsistent with this intent of Congress that you
discussed?
MR» KIIOURY:

No*

I wouldn't say that the Executive

because here's the thing, can we say that Congress would
realize that this same statute, or that the suspension of time
and grade, or that the President would realize that this
suspension of time and grade, which causes the rapid promotion,
would also push out a bunch of well-qualified people?
Do you see what I'm getting at?
what the effect is.

I mean, that's really

You want to increase the size of the military, but,

at the same time, because yoii're suspending the time and grade,

QUESTION:

Well, I'm still worried about your

statement that this one man, Lieutenant Ballard, Congress meant
to give him the same relief he gave women*

to deny Lieutenant Ballard of these extra three years.
That's the assumption that we can't make.
QUESTION:

Well, I just can't think of Lieutenant

well-qualified people.

It's bound to be so when you move

out of the Vietnam war or any other war into a peacetime
period that you begin to tune down your military establish­
ment.

And this is a part of that process, isn't it?
MR* KIIOURY:

Hut what if you inject sex into that

our problem is*

And that's really what

Because we have no quarrel with the

MR* KIIOURY:

Well, I have a hard time with that.

I couldn't find any intent of Congress to that effect, and
I'm vjondering about justifying a discriminatory scheme by
saying that it’s to make up for another discrimination, and
we're not in a tax situation like Kahn vs. Shevin.

And it's on that basis that you're

MR. KIIOURY:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the reason it’s

such a late suggestion on my part is that it was -- I just
came across Odegaard in that logic, and Odegaard •— DePunis

I must bring that up to the Court.
Also the idea of dismissing this appeal on the idea
of the — that the fact that the federal question hasn’t been
properly presented,

Ho rmch of what I’ve been talking about

here has been affidavits, and what the government has been
putting forth were presented in affidavits which were pre­
sented after the trial in this case, in a notion for new
trial.

And they have never been responded to by Lieutenant

Ballard, because the trial was over.
And that's not a proper way to bring a federal
question before this Court, as I said in my brief, and I did
raise this in my brief:

that the federal question is not

And it would be best for the Court, if

the Court isn't going to rule in favor of me and my client

have the question properly presented.

favor of my client on the merits in this case, and find, Ho.

QUESTION:

If the rational basis is applied, Hr.

Khoury, does it make much difference whether the arguments
are put in the form of an affidavit by an Admiral or whether
they're put in the form of an attorney's brief, saying
rational people could argue that such-and-such would serve a
purpose?

I mean, one way you're confronted with it as a

statement of fact, another way you're confronted with a
legal argument; but it's pretty much the same argument.
MR, KIIOURYj

Your Honor,

the whole point of their

affidavits is the Pandora's box argument that I alluded to
before? namely, v/ords to the effect that the Havy is going to
come to a screeching halt if the Court implements this relief.
Not that there is any discrimination, but that the relief is
going to be very hard on the Navy,

And that's what I'm

contesting —• that I have never had a chance to contest by
way of interrogatories.

It's never stood the test of trial.

Because, let me say this, that there are actually,
in my experience — and here I'm doing the same thing that I'm
saying the. government is doing, and I don't want to be
testifying; but there are very few people who are going to
take advantage of this, so it can't bring the Navy to a
screeching halt,
QUESTION: ' But is this really the way we're trying
constitutional cases now?

What I'm saying is addressed,

perhaps, more to the government than to yous

that instead of

44

making arguments as lawyers as to supporting justifications,
you take people's depositions and put them on the witness
stand to see what they were thinking when they promulgated
a particular regulation?
MR, KIIOURY:

There are a lot of facts which have

been spoken to by the government, which — in an attempt to
support a rational basis, which were never raised before.
And that's the — and I contest their accuracy.

Uell, does that meet the rational basis

45

MR. K1IOURY:

ITo.

I don't think that nests the

rational basis test at all.
QUESTION: Mr. Khoury, let rae go back to where I
started.

Did this statute precede the admission of women

into the Wavy?
MR. KIIOURY:
QUESTION:
MR, KIIOURY:
QUESTION:

10 USC G302?
Yes.
Did it precede the admission —
Was it on the books?

Was it a practice

before the formation of the WAVES?
MR. KIIOURY:

I -— I can't answer that, Your Honor,

in all honesty.
QUESTION:

If it were, I suppose, at that time,

there isn't any constitutional argument.

And the constitution

al argument arises only because of the presence of 6401.
MR, KIIOURY:

That's true.

QUESTION: Then, why isn't 6401 the unconstitutional
statute?
MR, KIIOURY:

Well, the scheme is unconstitutional,

and the point is, in the two ways that we approach this, the
court below had the decision:

what were they going to do;

what relief were they going to grant?
And then that's the decision that they had to make,
as to try to figure out what Congress intended.
In other words, when you say which statute, I don't

46
like to say that one or the other is unconstitutional.

To

argue -— because, for one tiling, 10 UEC 6302 did not just -did not combine women in it.

So I had to argue that two

statutes in the same section, 10 United States Code,
operating together, as a whole, were unconstitutional.
Does the Court see what I’m getting at?

And that’s

what my argument was below.
QUESTION s

My problem is that I think we had a

constitutional system before 6401 was enacted, and because of
its enactment, all of a sudden, you’re here claiming
unconstitutionality of the other statute.
I just wondered if chronology had anything to do
with it at all,
MR. KIIOURY:

I think the chronology would help in

figuring out what the intent of Congress is, Your Honor, and
that’s what the Court lias to do when they are granting relief.
In other words, we can conclude on the merits that
there's an unconstitutional discrimination.
what to do about it.

The question is

And the court below took the action

that they did, and I'm talking about the fact here now that
there is ample justification to support their assumption
that this is what Congress would do.
Now, unless there are any further questions, I -QUESTIONs

I just want to be sure I understand your

suggestion that this case may be moot.

47

HR, KHOURY:

Yes, Your Honor, because of the fact

that at the time the lawsuit was filed, he did not come within
the relief established in this — and I’m referring — let
me just refer the Court specifically to the brief —* and the
government alluded to it in oral argument.

Hut basically,

in the government’s brief, at page 5, footnote 6, there is a
statement about this long-standing policy of the Navy to
retire individuals when they've gotten within two years of
retirement.
And then there's the Forbes affidavit, which is in
Appendix 9a, and then there's also an affidavit, which is
not in the Appendix, but is in the record in this case, which
was filed by the government, which stated that, yes, in fact,
the Navy does have this long-standing policy to retire
individuals when they get within two years of retirement.
And it's supported by statute, and that's
statute, 10 TJSC 1006(e).

— and I cited the

And that he is now within that, and

it's my understanding that he's going to he retired on that,
that they really — based on the Navy's long-standing policy,
what is there to exempt him from that long-standing policy?
QUESTION:

And he's now within •— what *— five

months or so?
HR, ilTTOTJRY:
QUJiSj'lOIJ:

Right.

Well, February 19 75.

Whatever that is, next January or

MR. KIIOURY;

Right.

QUESTION:

Yes , but —

QUESTION:

It’s not mandatory, is it?

MR» KIIOURY;

Let me state what that situation is.

It is not — it is the long-standing policy, all nine of the
officers who were in Lieutenant Ballard's class* in this
group of people who v/ere two years, within two years, they
were all retired.

In the new bill that becomes mandatory.

Let me say something further, that in the new bill
that the government was talking about, he has no problem»
Not -- none of these people have any problem in this new bill.
They all have equity, they get large equity payments, a lot
of this — this is taken care of.
But it's true, Your Honor, it's this 10 —
QUESTION:

Yes, but the policy involved v/ill reserve

appointment according to that —
MR. KIIOURY;

That's right.

In other words, -~

QUESTION:

So your thought is that under this

at this juncture, however this case comes out, he'd probably
get a reserve appointment, —
MR. KIIOURY;
QUESTION:
MR. KIIOURY:

Exactly.
— so that he could retire in February.
Exactly.

Thank you, Your Honor.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have any tiling

49
further, Mrs. Shapiro?
QUESTION:

I just have one other question on that.

If he gets the reserve appointment, will that entitle him to
stay in a total of thirteen years after having been passed
over twice?
MR. KirotJRY:
OURS 11ON:

Oh, well, it will just —
Mill that equalize him with a woman —

a woman similarly situated?
MR„ KilOURY:
Honor.

Right.

As a practical — yes, Your

As a practical matter, he'll be able to stay in until

retirement, whici his retirement is — well, his retirement
actually — even if he stays in until February 16th, 1975,
that's retirement

what's nineteen and a half years.

He'll

be in nineteen ant. a half years February 16th, 1975,
QUESTION:

iut that still doesn't give him what a

woman would have, I think, does it?

Thirteen years,

As a lieutenant.
MR* KIIOURY:
QUESTION;

MR. KIIOFRY:

Very close to it,
As a lieutenant.

It will be very close to it, very

close to it, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Khoury, I :>el~v/e our practice in

cases where we find the case is moot is tw vacate the judgment
below and direct the action be dismissed.

So -jiat yOU wouid,

in effect, lose the benefit of your district coui

judgment

50

if we, as I understand it, if we concluded it was moot.
Is that agreeable to you?
MR# KIIOURY:

Hell, Your Honor, I v/as — in dismissing

-- I'm talking about that in the context of dismissing the
appeal.
QUESTION:
MR. KIIOURY:

Well, but —
I thought if the Court would dismiss

the appeal on the grounds of. Ho. 1, if the *— if, for
example, it was an improperly presented federal question —
QURSTIOH:

If a case is moot, though, under our

Munsingwear case, we vacate the judgment below and direct
tliat the action be dismissed#
QUnSTIOH:

That’s different from a dismissal of

the appeal if it’s improperly brought.
A judgment in the latter case stands, but in the
former, a dismissal is moot, vacation it doesn’t.
MR. KIIOURY:
the Court, then?

Well, I — may I suggest something to

Because this is a very important point, and

I'm only raising it for the first time.
I would'like to submit a brief on this, an additional
brief on this issue, because it is so important.

And, obviously.

I don’t want, in any way, shape or form, to be asking the
Court to do something that will undercut the victory that was
won below, and so I \;ould ask to be able to submit a brief.
QUKSTIOH:

Suppose the government were to say to us

51

today, We're going to apply this policy, put him on a reserve
appointment status, so that then he can be retired in
February.

Would you still object to a vacation and dismissal

of the action as moot?
MR. KHOURY s

The Court puts me in a tough position*

I don't see how, if the — if my client is going to
be, is to get this retirement which was really the ultimate
of the lawsuit, I don't see how I could object*
Thank you,
QUESTION;

What about that, Mrs, Shapiro?

Mrs. Shapiro,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLANTS
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION;

Yes.

The —

Well, what about that, is it true?

As your footnote 5 says, circumstances like this, that within
two years of retirement, as he now is, if you follow the
practice, whether you have to do it or not, is to give him a
reserve appointment and let him finish out for .retirement*
MRS* SHAPIRO:

That is the policy.

certainly a special situation*

But this is

The only reason that he is

still in service is because the Navy has been enjoined from
discharging him.

And that is not the sane kind of a situation*

If this Court should decide that the injunction was
properly issued, the Secretary of the Navy has not made up his

52

mind what he would do.

As a matter of fact, he's waiting to

see how this case comes out.
QUESTION: Well, you could still win the case, and
the injunction could still have been properly issued,
couldn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

I ~

QUESTION: Well, what about — I suppose until an
appeal was finally over, \mtil the case was finally over,
an injunction could have been outstanding,
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, the injunction against dis­

charging him, I believe is based on the conclusion that the
statute was —
QUESTION:

Final conclusion on the merits?

MRS* SHAPIRO:

Yes, there's a permanent injunction

that we're under, that *— the reason for the injunction —
QUESTION: Was there a preliminary injunction
issued?
HRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, there was.

Of course, if there's an affirmance,

then what's your situation?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

If there's — yes, if there's

affirmance •— the Secretary of the Navy hasn't decided.

He

doesn't — I mean, he —
QUESTION:
can’t discharge him

Well, if the injunction remains, you

MRS. SHAPIRO:

That’s true.

Yes — oh, I see —

yes, that’s true.
QUESTION:

That's right, and in February he may

retire»
MRS. SHAPIRO:

That’s right.

Well, we can’t

discharge him until — for thirteen years»
QUESTION:

And you can’t even discharge him in

February, you have to hold him —
MRS* SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

We have to hold him for —

— prior to the expiration — you can’t

discharge him prior to the expiration of thirteen years of
commissioned service.
MRS. SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes» This is —

Making the same, equivalent, as though

he were a female.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

We would hope that if the Court found

that there was an unconstitutional discrimination, it would
— we would have the — the relief would indicate that if the
special statute were repealed, why, he wouldn’t have to fee
kept for the thirteen years.
QUESTION:
repealed,

That, you know, the —

Well, I would suppose, if it were

you would go back to the district court and tell

them so, and let them decide in the first instance what happened.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

Yes.

We wouldn't decide that on an iffy basis

lio.

Ho.

Who knows.

MRS. SHAPIROThe only other point I wanted to
make was that the class actions that Mr. Khoury referred to
are pending in the district court, and, as a matter of fact,
we're under injunctions prohibiting the discharge of the
people that are involved in those cases.

Lieutenant Ballard
There's one case

involving lieutenants who would have been discharged in
June of '73, and the other in June of '74.

And those cases

are being held, pending the outcome of this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mrs* Shapiro,

and Mr. Khoury.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
