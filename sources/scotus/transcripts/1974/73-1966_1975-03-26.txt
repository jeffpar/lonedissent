REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF:

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1966, Aberdeen and Rcckfish Railroad Company
et al against Students Challenging Regulatory Agency
Procedures, et al consolidated with No. 73-1971, United
States against Students Challenging Regulatory Agency
Procedures.
Mr. Horsky, I think you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. HORSKY, ESQ.
MR. HORSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and >ray it please

the Court,
This, I think, is the third time this proceeding
has been before this Court.

I hope I can persuade you that

it should be the last.
The present posture of it involves basically two
questions, the Jurisdiction of the lower court to enter an
order on the merits, whether the order was correct.
Because it has been the position of the Inter­
vening railroads, whom I represent, that the lower court
lacked jurisdiction and we have urged that, I am seeking
first and I will try and confine myself to the jurisdic­
tional issue.
Mr. Randolph will deal with the merits should
the Court reach them.

4
QUESTION:

Mr. Horsky, are you going to cover the

jurisdiction of this Court as well as
MR. HORSKY:

of the District Court?

I had hoped that I could rely on our

briefs for that, but I'll be glad to comment on it If you
like.
Let me put this case in context.

This proceeding

began in 1972 and the course of events at the courts and at
the Commission since that time is set out in our briefs In
detail.

I think 1 can make our present posture of it clear

in a very few words.
At the 1972 term, this Court dealt with the problem
of a temporary emergency surcharge which had been proposed
by the railroads in early 1972.

As the

Court is aivare, as

vhe Chief Justice indicated in the preceding argument, in the
railroad industry, tariff changes are made by the railroads
and subject only to a power in the Commission to suspend for
a period of seven months, the rates proposed by the railroads
;-(o into el feet as a matter of law and they remain in effect
unless and until the Commission itself finds them unlawful.
In 1972, when the Commission declined to suspend the
temporary emergency surcharge, this District Court, the same
District Court we have now, enjoined the Commission to do so.
This Court reversed that decision on the ground of
ArgQIf.Transportatlon Company, that the Court had no jurisdiction
to deal with suspension orders.

5
In the meantime, the railroads had replaced 2.5
percent surcharge with a general 4 percent rate increase
which became generally effective in October of 1972 with
one exception.

As applied to recyclables, the Commission

did suspend the increase until June 1973 while it undertook
a rather elaborate effort to further

explore the environ­

mental problems.
Shortly before June 1973, when that 4 percent
increase was to take effect on recyclables, the Respondents
here sought an Injunction and the District

Court again

enjoined the rates.
Again, this Court reversed.
While that appeal by our side from that Injunction
was pending, the Appellees, the Respondents here, sought
declaratory judgment in the lower courts.

They sought two

things; they sought, first, a declaration that the environ­
mental impact statement prepared by the Interstate Commerce
Commission was Inadequate and that therefore, Its order
allowing the rate increase to go into effect was invalid and
that the Commission should be directed to prepare a new
environmental Impact statement and, second, that the rates
should be enjoined.
A divided District Court this time concluded that
it had jurisdiction to review the general revenue

orders

by reason of a supposed NEPA exception — the National

6
Environmental Protection Act — it is too hard to say, so,
NEPA, if I may and on the merits, the environmental impact
statement as applied to recyclables was inadequate and must
be redone by the Commission.
It declined, however, to enjoin the collection of
the rates and they are now being collected.
Now, that is the posture of the case as it is now
before you.
The Respondents do urge, Mr. Justice, that there
■ is no jurisdiction in this Court on two grounds, that the
- order of the Commission was phrased in terms of "setting
aside" rather than "enjoining the Commission," and the case
may be

moot.
QUESTION:

The order of the Court?

MR. HORSKY:

MR. HORSKY:

Setting aside rather than enjoining.

We have dealt wit.h that, Mr. Justice in our reply brief at
some length, both the Government and ourselves and in the
interests of time I don't think the arguments are meritorious
and I would prefer

not to take my time on them, but I will

If you like.
I'd like to deal with the jurisdiction of the
District Court, which is terribly Important and I'd like
to persuade you, if I can, that the dissenting judge below
reached the correct result when he said they did not have
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Did I misunderstand you?

Did you say

you didn't think the arguments were meritorious?
MR. HORSXY:

I thought they were not meritorious.

The argument as to the jurisdiction of this
Court, to review this appeal -- I don't believe they are
very substantial.

In the Electronic Industries case, the same

point was briefed and argued to this Court and the Court
went ahead and decided it.
In our motion — they made a motiong to dismiss
the appeal on this ground and you did not reserve a question
of jurisdiction of the merits.

I think there is not very

much reason why I should be worried about those arguments
at this point.

8
The question of jurisdiction of the District
Court, as I say, is really a very important question and I
do want to talk about that.

I can state it very simply.

For about 40 years, since a decision by Judge
Chestnut in Baltimore in the Algoma case, the district courts,
the federal district courts, have declined jurisdiction when
asked to review general resolute orders of the Commission.
That is, orders which are so-called "ex parte"
in
orders/which the railroads propose a general across-the-board
; rate increase and in which the decision of the Commission as
• to whether or not to suspend the orders, suspend the increases

not; the railroads need additional
revenue.

It has nothing to do with whether the rates are

In such

cases and in this case, the

commission makes very clear that the rates which have been

is
Chestnut pointed out, the consequence/ that challenging them
in the general revenue proceedings is premature and that these
people are properly remitted to the procedure where the rates,
the actual legality of the rates can properly be tested.
QUESTION:

What if one wanted to challenge the
•

•

9
Commission’s determination that the railroad, in fact,
needed more revenue?
MR. HORSKY:

That would be open if the commission

had relied on It in its determination.
In other words, you file a Section XIII proceed­
ings — I mean, a Section XIII complete against recyclable
rates.

The commission has a hearing.

have an Investigation.

It is mandated to

It is not optional.

It mu3t do it.

And it must come out with a decision as to whether or not
the rates are just and reasonable.
If the commission’s decision is bottomed on the
needs of the railroads, that is reviewable by the courts,
just like anything else.
If the commission does not rely on that, that
isn’t at issue as to justness and reasonableness, then it
need not be reviewed because it isn't relevant any more.
QUESTION:

So that wouldn’t be a reason for

revievrlng a general rate?
’at. RORSKY:

I should think no.

No, that is not

any reason why yon would need to review a, general revenue
order because if it becomes a matter of issue in a particu­
lar case where the real issue is presented, that is, is this
a lawful rate?

To the extent that the needs of the rail­

roads for revenues enter into that determination, it is
reviewable just like any other consideration is entered into.

10
The Algoma rule really is very similar to the more
familiar rule in the Arrotf Transportation

case which this

Court accepted and applied In the previous decision in
case, in the earlier S.C.R.A.P. case.

this

That decision was, as

I say, that the Arrow decision, that courts will not review
suspension orders of the commission.
Because the ICC has no general power to get to give
prior approval to the rates» these ex part© proceedings, the
general revenue proceedings are handled essentially the same
way as through the suspension power.
General revenue orders don’t determine whether the
rate is just and reasonable.

They leave that, as does the

suspension order, to a further administrative remedy.
i

Now, in this case. Judge Wright, -writing for himself
and Judge Ritchie, concluded not to follow the Algoma rule.
He had, in fact, in 1970, dissented from his application in
a case that I'll come to in a moment that reached this Court
in the District — from the District of Columbia, but in this
case, he did not dissent from the Algoma rule, he found what
he said was a NEPA exception to it.
That is, that under —• if the challenges under
Environmental Protection Act, the court has jurisdiction to
review notwithstanding the Algoma rule.
j.s

We believe that that

directly in the teeth of prior decision of this Court in

the earlier case, your earlier hearing in this case.

11
Let me refresh your recollection.

In that case

the lower court, the same district judge, concluded that
although under the Arrow Transportation Company rule,
district courts did not have the power to interfere with the
exercise of the commission’s suspension order.
Nonetheless, because this was a NEPA case, they
could go ahead and do it.

This Court reversed and it said

in its opinion that NEPA did not contemplate any wholesale
overruling of prior loss.
QUESTION:

But, of course, Arrow Is dependent

upon a particular provision of statutory law and its general
rate order is kind of judicially carved out —
MR. HORSKY:

Well, I think that is a distinction,

really, that's — I don’t think that is quite true, your
Honor.

You did refer to Section XV(7) and to the history

but I believe that the analysis In Arrow and the analysis
in the Aigorna case are practically the same.
to the statute.

They look to the statute.

They go back
What does the

statute contemplate?
You have a very nicely balanced system created
after a great deal of experimentation by Congress using
railroad initiative to create the rates, a certain amount
of commission power to suspend them for awhile and an
adequate remedy with reparation, if necessary, for anyone
who is injured by this process and the District Court

decision in Algoma, just like the Arrow Transportation.
decision and the previous decision in S.C.R.A.P. are all
part of that statutory system which has been worked out over
the years.

Yes.
Let me talk about the Electronic

case because I think you don't need to reach,

really,» the Algoma rule in this case because I think the
Electronic Industries case applies here.
”

In the other two cases, in Atlantic City and

Alabama Power, the challenge was, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist
has suggested» to the — whether the commission was right in
its determination that revenue needs warranted the increase.
That cut across all the rates.
In Electronic Industries» the challenge was

to particular rates, on television sets, radio sets, com­
ponents of those sets, Just as here the challenge Is to
recycle commodities and we submit that the unanimous decision
of this Court in Electronic Industries means that certainly
you will not permit a challenge to particular commodities In
the general revenue order proceedings, which is what this
■'case is."
The Government, I am unhappy to say, agrees
partially with that but not wholly with it.
that the

They agree

Electronic Industries case means what I have just

said It means but they don’t agree that this Is such a case.
They say, and I am quoting from their brief, the
Respondents broadly attacked the commission’s general
revenue order.
I don’t think that is correct.
that is dead wrong.

In fact, I think

The general revenue order here decided

essentially that the railroad’s need for revenue permitted the
commission to terminate the suspension which it had originally
ordered prior to the expiration of this suspension date.
That determination isn't challenged by the
Respondents.

They zeroed in on

a

fev; specific rates, on a

dozen or so recyclable commodities.
They say that those are the ones that are bad and
that seems to

me to be just like the Electronic Industries

and if, as I suggested, Electronic Industries means that you

15
can't take particular rates and challenge them In a general
revenue proceedings, 1 think that would dispose of this
case but if the Court were to agree with the Government that
this is not an Electronic Industries,, if you were back to
Algoma and the problem that divided the Court in 1969» I
would like to take a moment or two to urge as strongly as
I can that you do affirm the Algoma doctrine.
Tiie basic point in that doctrine is that nobody
is entitled to a rate which is less than just and reason­
able and that there can be no resolution of that questions
no definitive resolution of what that questions the answer
to that question, except in a Section XIII or Section XV
proceeding.

You can’t settle it in a general revenue pro­

ceedings.
In a Section XIII proceedings, the commission can
and It does take into account all factors which go into the
reasonableness of the rate, including, of course,
environmental factors.
Allowing a review of it in a general revenue order
Is really no different than reviewing a suspension order and
it really is no different than reviewing any kind of
interlocutory order before there has really beep a decision.
But it has been — it is more than that.

This

would certainly encourage objections to all general
revenue orders.

Under our new legislation effective this

year, those objections now go not to district courts, but to
courts of appeals, but I would venture to say we would have an
appeal in each of the 11 circuit courts from every general
revenue order by somebody.
QUESTION:

Then that summary as to

action is

brought after a certain date, isn't it?
MR. HORSKY:
QUESTION:

Yes, at any time in the future.
It will be a couple of years before w®

get to that, I guess.
MR. HORSKY:

Well, if a new order comes up.

If the railroads ask for a new general rate increase
we are going to have objections.

We are going to

have

injunctions with possibility of discriminatory decisions,
different decisions and different circuits and any decision
that they make, as this Court Indicated in the previous
reversal of the District Court in this case, would have an
impact, a premature impact on the administrative procedure
and would violate what you had said should not be done under
; Wichita Grain case.
Moreover, it seems to me that because one would
expect these attacks and one would expect, as we have had in
this case, injunctions after injunctions which have to be
appealed to be reversed, the effect on the railroad revenues
where these orders are based on revenue needs would be
substantial.

The railroads Ere in need of revenue

17
I don’t mean that is a reason why the Court should
have Jurisdiction, but it does seem to me that that is a
factor to be taken into consideration by this Court in
determining whether a rule which has been in effect for *10
years, which is part of the framework of this nicelybalanced system which has worked out, as 1 say, in the
statute between the rights of the railroads to propose
rates, the rights of the commission to suspend them, the
rights of the shippers and others to protest them, to be
protected and get rebates or reimbursement if the rates are
vrrong, whether any change in a 40-year-old system should be
made by this Court or, if it is to be changed at all,
should not be made by Congress.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Hr. Horsky,

Mr. Randolph.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In the time remaining to Appellants, I would like
to devote my attention to the merits of the case, as
Mr. Horsky said.
Our position on the jurisdictional issue is set
forth in our reply brief on page 2 to 4.

The ICC and the

United States have not taken any position against or

13
argued against the exercise of jurisdiction by the District
Court since Appelleeslnvoked the District Court’s jurisdiction
we are sure that they will devote substantial

attention to it.

The issue on the merits in this case is whether the
Interstate Commerce Commission adequately complied ifith the
National Environmental Protection Act, NEPA.

That is» did

the ICC3 in its final environmental impact statement in this
case» adequately consider the environmental impact of its
action?
In the first opinion that the Court rendered In
this case in 1973» the Court remarked that the ICC, the
Interstate Commerce Commission» had issued a report in October
of 1972 which

ran approximately 300 pages in length and

gave extensive — and I quote the Court —-’'consideration to
environmental factors."
The commission at that time did not issue an
environmental impact statement» as NEPA requires for signifi­
cant federal actions affecting the environment because the
commission believed that the action that they were then
taking» ’which was allowing a rate increase to go into effect»
would not affect the environment.
However» as Mr. Horsky has described» when the
Commission’s report was issued» there were a number of protests
a number of critical comments.
As a result» the commission reopened the proceedings

19
In regard to one particular class of items, recyclables and
I think it is well to define what we mean by recyclables
here.

It sounds like one small group or class of commodi­

ties.

In fact, it is a huge class of commodities.
On page 13 of the Appendix, the commission drops
\

a footnote and defines what is meant by recyclables.

They

list a number of classifications of different commodities.
Now, I emphasize the word “classifications."

In

other 'words —QUESTION:

On page 13, is it, of the brown —

MR. RANDOLPH:

Page 13 of the Appendix,

It is

the last footnote on the page.
They may be confusing because in the upper righthand comer there are numbers that say 91 — it says "photo-

offset" anci I think
QUESTION:

that

is

the reason.

You want us to look at the bottom

number?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

On page 13, the footnote.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Umn hmn.

The footnote describes and defines

what is meant by "recyclables" and

then lists, by number

and by description, various classifications of commodities.
However, it is misleading to think that these are
the only commodities, that we are only talking about a
dozen or so commodities because within each one of these

20

transportation classifications are hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of different commodities.
Por example, I had xeroxed before the argument, the,
all of the commodities comprised in the last two Items, that
is, 4l, ashes and l\2 waste or scrap.
Now, this is from the tariff that is issued by the
American Association of railroads and it runs page after
page after page.
QUESTION:

A good many of these commodities I have

never heard of before, like noils, rovings, cullets —
QUESTION:

That is nails.

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

They are noils.

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Mo, they are noils.

They are noils.

They are —

And then there are rovings —

MR. RANDOLPH:

They are rovings.

They are

basically —
QUESTION:

And then there is cullet.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Cullet.

That is glass scrap and

noils are basically filings.
QUESTION:

These are goods and chattels of which I

have never heard in my life.
MR. RANDOLPH:

And they move on the nation’s rail­

roads every day, Mr. Justice.

And they all have different

tariff rates and I think I have heard it estimated and I don’t

21
think anyone really knows how many different rates there
are throughout the United States.

Someone estimated a

trillion.
I think a billion is certainly a very conservative
estimate of the number of rates and all one has to do is to
think of the fact that for any given commodity such as
potatoes moving between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. will
have one rate and if it move3 between Washington, D.C. and
some other city so for the tens of thousands of commodities
that move on the natioris railroads every day, between
hundreds of thousands of points of origins and destinations,
you have different rates.
We are dealing here with a group of commodities,
recyclables.

It is a large

group of commodities and for

every place, destination, origin, there are different rates
that are applicable.
The ICC, the commission, in trying to determine
what environmental Impact a rate increase would have on
these recyclable commodities, took a very general

view.

dealt with eight specific broad classifications
of commodities and it dealt in general terms with recy­
clables and having reopened the proceedings to deal with
recyclables and having Issued a bibliography that it
distributed to all the interested parties of 500 different
sources setting forth what effect could be expected on the -

of the rate increase and contacting by telephone, by mall,
compiling, analysing, the commission finally issued a 20Q“page
draft impact statement, a copy of which is reprinted in the
Appendix.
After the commission issued that draft impact
statement, they received comments from various federal
agencies.

They received comments from the parties to this

case.
To give the Court an idea of how generally general
revenue proceedings really is. Just consider the fact that
469 attorneys entered appearances in this proceedings, 469.
The proceeding is very general.
asked for comments.

The commission

It received comments.

The final report, which runs nearly 200 pages and
is printed in the front of the Appendix — for example, went
into great detail about the general classes that the
commission decided to consider.
Let me take steel, for example.
a section, scrap steel.

The commission has

What effect will a 4.1 or a 6 percent

increase on the transportation rate for scrap steel have on
the environment?
To consider that, the commission Went through a
review of the steelmaking industry at large.

It reviewed the

steelmaking technology, how steel is made, what kind of
furnaces are used.

It took a look at the steel foundry

23
systems throughout the United States.

It considered the

scrap industry structure , the various different kinds of
scrap that are used and then ferrous scrap technology.
As a result, 200 pages of very, very detailed and
complex analysis, the commission came to a conclusion and
the conclusion was that perhaps this whole impact statement
x*as mistitled.

Maybe it should have been called an

environmental non-impact statement because the commission’s
conclusion was that this rate increase would have no
significant effect vdiatever on the environment.
If the commission’s consideration of environmental
factors in October '72 was expensive, as this Court said,
by the spring of 1973 it was tenfold more.

It pervaded

this entire proceedings.
Since this Impact statement was issued, there have
been five more genera?- revenue proceedings.

They are coining

now at the rate of on© every six or seven months as the
railroad’s revenues decline, as costs go up and the rail­
roads need more money.
The environmental impact statement issued in
ex parte 295 which came after this proceedings was filed
with this Court, lodged with the Court.
Also, an environmental impact statement was
issued in a general overall investigation of the underlying
i

rate structure of the railroads in this country, ex parte

zn
270.

That was lodged In this Court.
If one reads the brief filed by S.C.R.A.P.

in

this case and, particularly, the factual statement, one will
come away with the conclusion, particularly on pages 10 to 11
of the sort of green-colored brief, that everything the
Commission has done since this proceedings, since this
impact statement, has contradicted itself.
That, although it found no significant environ­
mental impact here, in later proceedings, it was using more
r.

sophisticated analysis and greater study and so on and so
forth.

It came to a different conclusion.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
On page 10, for example, in the S.C.R.A.P. brief,

appellees state,''rather than having no significant environ­
mental impact as claimed in the commission’s previous boiler­
plate findings —" referring to this case, "that the
commission found In ex parte 295 that the following would
occur with respect to nonforrous metals."

And then there is

a quotation.
Let me read to the Court exactly what precedes that
quotation.

The commision said, and
QUESTION:

MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

I

Thank you.

25
MR. RANDOLPH:

The commission said, and I'll

read right up to the beginning of that quotation, "However,
the quantitative effects of the three percent rate increase
will be very small.

In all cases, only a fraction of one

percent of the presently recycled volume of any commodity.
As a result, the environmental impacts in terms of the
Increased consumption of resources including energy and of
pollution are expected to be insignificant."
And now we reach the quotation.

"Specifically,

in regard to nonferrous metals, the decrease in scrap
consumption is expected to be two-one hundredths of one
percent of the present volume as a result pf ’which —" and
then the quotation picks up ~ "'An estimated 3,000 tons of
metal will be annually required,'"
The same is true for the quotation on page 11.
What the Appellees have set forth as seeming to be a great
environmental impact actually, according to this commission’s
later environmental impact study is a decrease In recycled
scrap of .18 of one percent, as a result of the 3 percent
rate increase.
And I might add, too — 3ir?
QUESTION:

You lost me, at least as to what you

were reading from when you added the

omitted parts on

page 10.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I'm reading from — yes, sir.

I am

26
reading from a final environmental impact statement in a
later general revenue proceedings.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. RANDOLPH:
the

Court.

This has been filed and lodged with

It is ex parte 295«

I might say also that this minimum impact that the
which
commission found/confirms everything that it said in this
case, which involves ex parte 23l is on a worst ease basl3.
This is worst that could be expected, a two-100ths
effect.
The District Court held here that the commission
failed to give adequate consideration to the environment and
must

begin its proceeding all over again.

Why?

Because

the commission failed to issue an environmental impact
statement?

Hardly.

Because the commission did not comply

with the NEPA'a five requirements of what the commission must
look at?'

Ho, the District Court said the commission did.

comply with NEPA as to form.
Because the ICG’s consideration of environmental
Impact was not expensive?

It could hardly claim that.

Because the commission’s conclusion of no signifi­
cant effect from the rate Increases was mistaken?
Curiously, there’s no one in this' case yet that
says the commission was wrong back in 1973 when it issued
this impact statement, that that 4.1 rate increase would

27
affect the environment.
Nobody said that, no.
What the District Court held is that the commission
didn’t do enough.

That it should have studied some more.

That maybe it was right here.

Maybe it was wrong.

But it

had to, and I quote, "Not limit its analysis,” as it did
here, to the "marginal impact of the most recent rate
increase with no discussion whatever of the underlying
rate structure itself as that significantly affects the
environment."
X

pause at this point and present to the Court

that everything I have said so far in regard to analysis
on this and also in regard to what the District Court held
has very little to do directly with the environment.
Of the questions that 1 have talked about, you
could, have a team of the greatest environmental scientists
in the world sitting in a room with all the books.

They

could never solve any of these questions.
Why not?
Because what we are really talking about here is
economic forecasting, not — and only derivatively the
environment.
That is, if recyclables do not move on the nation's
railroads, then as a result more virgin ore will have to be
consumed to produce the final end product.

28
But what we are engaged in here and what the
commission was engaged in is really economic forecasting.
This is not a case, for example, like — where the question
was, what effect will thermal pol3.ution have on the flora and
fauna of the tidal estuary?
That is not the question here.

The question here

is what effect on the movement of goods on the natioris rail­
ways will a three percent 02' four percent rate increase have?
Once we recognize that, we must recognise as 'well
that any investigation into that kind of a question can
mushroom into — it is open-ended.

It can mushroom into the

And once you reach that point, you have to go

What is the public demand?

Will people buy?

What will the state of the economy be?
And so on until you have analyzed the entire
American economy to determine what effect a certain rate
increase could have on the movement of steel scraps through
out the nation's railroads?
And remember, we are not talking about just one
commodity.

We are talking about, literally, under these

classifications, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
commodities and having dons all that, if it takes you six
months or seven months or a year or two years and so on
and so forth, by the time the ink is dry and the thing is
printed up it is probably out of date because there has
been a tax cut, an oil crisis, the prime interest rates
have changed.
The District Court’s critique, we

submit, of the

commission’s environmental impact, comes down to simply
this, that the commission could have done more.
But that, we submit, is a standardless inquiry,
we submit, as well [as] that the commission could always
do more when it is engaged in environmental forecasts,
which brings us to what we think is the basic proposition
in this case.

While we believe ~~ and we have said in our brief,
that every agency must take a hard look at the environmental
consequences of what it proposes to do, that, nevertheless,
the nature of the inquiry depends on the nature of the
function performed by the agency.

under NEPA what Congress wanted an agency to do was answer

Not answer the question, did that action have an
effect on the environment?
Ahd the- reason I say'that is because if the
commission does not act Within seven months, then the rates
go into effect under Section XV(7) of the Interstate
Commerce Act.
Let me emphasize this again.
t

The Interstate Commerce Commission cannot revise
the entire underlying rate structure in a general revenue

proceeding.

It can only consider the question whether the

increase In rate Is Justified by the railroad*s needs.
We submitj in that situations the only thing the
commission has to analyze is whether that increase in rate
will have an adverse effect on the environment.
QUESTION:

The assumption is that the existing

rate structure is satisfactory and the only question is
whether you want to or need to Increase it across the
board.
MR. RANDOLPH:

In a general revenue proceeding9

that is correct.
Now, the commission did not say that, well, we
are going to take the underlying rate structure as a given
and we are going to ignore whether that has environmental
effect.
The commission said that we are studying that In
ex parte 270.

We have hired a special counsel.

We have

these proceedings going on.
To consider the entire rate structure of the
/

United States i3 no small task.

This is only the second

time in the commission's history that it has hired a special
counsel and the Court, of course, knows who the first one
was, Mr. Justice Brandeis.
But I just want to say one more thing about the
question of looking into the underlying rate structure.

32

The District Court relied upon comments from other
agencies and you have to read the District Court's opinion
very carefully in this regard because the Court did not say
that the commission failed to respond to comments of other
agencies when It issued its Impact statement.
On page 31-A, what the Court said Is, !iThe commission
did not order its conclusions in response to comments of
other agencies."
Well, the other agencies, for example ■— on page
706 of the Appendix, the' Council on Environmental Quality
gave a comment to the commission when it issued its impact
statement*

It said, "We are aware of the difficulties in

accomplishing everything that we think you should do in a
^short time and therefore, what we suggest is that you postpone
any rate increases on recyclables pending completion of
.......ex pari^f 270, the separate proceedings."
The commission's response to that suggestion was,
"You are right, we are going to go ahead with ex parte 270."
We can't postpone increases on recyclables.
Of course, under XV(7) of the Act, we can't say that,
well, we are not going to allow this increase to go into
effect after seven months because we are not sure what
effect it is going to have.
Under XV(7) of the Act, the commission has to say,
"We are going to allow the increase to go into effect unless

33
we have solid evidence that it would be unjust and un­
reasonable.

Therefore, the commission had to allow the

Increase to go into effect.
There are a number of other comments that were
made.

I submit that the comments of other agencies here

vrere answered, vrere responded to.
If you read through the impact statement, it is
it,
replete with responses to/comments of other agencies and
so on and so forth.
Ifd like to conclude by just saying one word
about the hearing requirement.

The District Court said that

when this goes back, the ICC has to conduct an oral hearing.
NEPA does not require oral hearing.

XV(7) of the

Interstate Commerce Act does not require oral hearing.
Somehow, the District Court put those two statutes together

and came up with a requirement of oral hearing.

I am not

entirely clear why and we don't think that kind of analysis
'should be affirmed by this Court.
Therefore, we ask for reversal.

' ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F, HELLEGERS, ESQ.
MR. HELLEGERS:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

34
I respectfully submit that this is a case in which
this Court lacks jurisdiction.
appeals under 28 IT.

The

case is here on direct

S. Code Section 1253 from the grant of a

13-month-old declaratory judgment that the Interstate
Commerce Commission is obliged to prepare an adequate
environmental impact statement in ex parte 281, this general
revenue proceedings and that it did not, in fact, do so.
Mow, if I had to depend for my information on this
case on the jurisdictional statements and the briefs of the
Appellants, I would have thought that this declaration had
deprived the Appellant Railroads of millions of dollars in
lost revenues and paralyzed the commission's ability to
conduct general revenue proceedings and that this was why the
Judgment was appealed.
But on closer examination,
simply is not so.

it turns out that this

It tas left to us to bring it to the

attention of the Court that the ICC has issued a whole series
of general revenue orders In the last 13 months, probably
more so than In any other .year In recent history.
This includes one that was served just yesterday
which

vt&s

lodged with the Court end, also something that I

would never have guessed from reading the Appellant's papers,
was that if we take the rates, the actual rail rates that are
allowed by the commission in effect just prior to ex parte
28l — this proceeding as being 100 —■ then it turns out that

35
now the rates on primary commodities — defined as all
those that are not recyclables— would he in the neighbor­
hood of 140 and those unrecyclables would be in the neigh­
borhood of 120.
Nows I submit that the judgment from which these
appeals were taken is certainly not an injunction and 1
would also point out that nobody claims that it is.
Rather, the claim is that there is an unwritten
exception to Section 1253 which authorizes direct appeals
to this Court, not only from the grant or denial of an
Injunction — what 1253 requires — but also from certain
noninjunctions and I would point out that the Appellants
do not rely on any currently effective statutory language
for that proposition.
What they rely on is ghost language which was
deleted from the traditional code 27 years ago in 1948.
QUESTION:

If a case identical to this had been

here in 1947, would you say that we had no jurisdiction
over it?
MR. HELLEGERS:

I was just about to answer your

Honor's question.
The answer to that is that if this case had come
up under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, on the surface of it,
it might appear that the

Urgent Deficiencies Act would

confer jurisdiction but I think that there is some

36
considerable doubt about that under the peculiar circum­
stances of this case.
The Urgent Deficiencies Act allowed appeals not
only from the grant or denial of an injunction but also from
the final hearing in any case that was brought to suspend or
set aside an ICC order.
Now, I'd like to call the Court's attention very
particularly in that context to a case that was cited to us
by the railroads and which I regret that we did not pick Up in
our brief, but I certainly would if the brief were being
written today.
That is the case of the United States versus
Griffin which is in 303 U.S. 226 and in Griffin, the Supreme
Court in a unanimous opinion — or a unanimous judgment in an
opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis — construed the Urgent
Deficiencies Act and held that its grant of extraordinary
jurisdiction — three-judge courts and direct appeals to the
Supreme Court — was not to be read even as broadly as its
literal language when the result of that would be to authorise
jurisdiction which had no substantial policy justification.
Specifically in Griffin, the Issue was that the
Urgent Deficiencies Act, on its face, authorized three-judge
court jurisdiction In any suit brought to spend, set aside,
enjoin or annul any order of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the Court held that the words "any order" did

37
not mean literally "any order," because there are some
orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which, said
Mr. Justice Brandeis, are manifestly not of such public
importance as to require this jurisdiction and the extra­
ordinary procedure of a three-judge court and direct appeals
to the Supreme Court.
So on the construction that the Court put on the
Urgent Deficiencies Act in Griffin, I would say that it is
doubtful whether, even had that statute been in effect,
whether a case as highly unusual as this would warrant
direct review by the Supreme Court and, a fortiorari, there
is certainly nothing in the Urgent Deficiencies Act which
requires the — or certainly on the current statutes which
requires the Court to give literal construction to a
statute which has been dead for 27 years in order to author­
ize an appeal here which has no substantial policy justifi­
cation.
QUESTION:
dead for 27 years.

Well, you cite a statute that has been
Are you arguing, then, that the revisers

of 19^8 intended to change?
MR. ESLLEGERS:

Well, I am arguing, certainly,

that they took out the language on which the Appellants
relied for jurisdiction in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, but then you argue that the

revisers did intend to change?

38
MR. HELLEGERS:

Well, X am arguing, your Honor,

that the jurisdiction in this Court, It seems to me, is a
matter that is governed by statutes and is governed by
currently existing statutes and the rule for many years has
been one of strict construction of jurisdictional statutes
and the -- I think a fair paraphrase of that rule is that
if Congress wants to confer extraordinary jurisdiction on
this Court for direct appeal, that it has to do so specifi­
cally in terms and in literal statutory language and just
last December, the Court

had a case, the Gonzalez case, in

which it was held that 1253a which is the statute under which
this purportedly comes up, is not to be given the full breadth
its
that/literal language might imply, if this leads to un­
desirable results.
QUESTION:

Well, it is one thing, I think, for

this Court to say something like that but I think quite
another to say that Congress, when

it adopted a revision

of the entire judicial code and one section was put in some­
what different form, intended a substantive change.
MR. HELLEGERS:

Well, the case on this that is cited

to us your Honors is the Rider case, which goes back to 1884
for
and the proposition/which Rider is cited is that in this
kind of revision that Congress has not intended to make
changes.

But I have looked into this,

I have shepherdized

case and none has been cited to us by the Appellants., in
which the Rider rule was used to create direct appeal
Jurisdiction in this Court, for that was in derogation of
the then currently-existing statutory language, so -QUESTION:

Well, xvhat is the deficiency?

This

order of the three-Judge "vacated” the orders of the
commission and "ordered" the commission to conduct "further
proceedings."
Now, what is the deficiency in that, in 1253

terras?
. • '* ■

MR, HELLEGERS:

Well, 1 think that, as your Honor

read that order, it is in two parts.

One purports to vacate

th© Interstate Commerce Commission!-? orders in ex parte 28l
and the other remands the ease to the Interstate Commerce
Commission for further proceedings in accordance with the
opinion.
QUESTION:

Well, and ordered the commission to

conduct further proceedings,
MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

All right, fine.

Yes.

MR. HELLEGERS:

I think that we have to look at

those parts on©-by-one and on the first part, the words
"vacate" and "void," which the Court also used sound,
certainly, as if they ought to mean something but when we

look more closely at this, we find that they mean almost
nothing, even potentially; perhaps literally nothing.
We assumed in writing the brief that the lower court
was correct in Its characterization of the effect of vacating
the commissiones orders when it said, "The only effect of our
vacating the commission’s orders is that the railroads may
not rely in certain hypothetical subsequent proceedings on a
commission finding that the proposed rates in 28l x*rere Just
and reasonable and we took that at face value.
The Appellants said nothing, which tended to suggest
that that was wrong.
I have since been persuaded that the lower court’s
"vacating" of the Commerce Commission's orders doesn’t even
have that effect and the reason is that the Interstate
Commerce Commission specifically declined to make an^’
finding that these rates were Just and reasonable and there is
also some ambiguity in the Government’s brief whicb. we picked
up in ours about whether the vacating of the commission’s
orders is going to have an effect on the burden of proof in
hypothetical subsequent reparation proceedings, should any
occur and the way that x?q picked it up from the Government’s
brief was that the vacating of the commission’s orders would
have the effect of shifting the burden of proof.
I have since been persuaded that that is not corrects
either, that the burden of proof in a XIII(1) proceeding is

41
always on the complainant and that nothing that happens by
ttfay of voiding or vacating a general revenue order.
QUESTION:

Well, now, what about the word

"ordered?"
MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

Well, I think that —

That is sort of injunctive, isn't it?

MR, HELLEGERS:

Well, I think for that we would

rely on the Taylor versus Board of Education case, Judge
Friendly's opinion in that in which he says that not every
order that has words of command is an injunction, just as
not every order that has words of prohibition is an
injunction on that side, either.
But, certainly, what the Court did did not meet
the requirements, say, of Rule 65 for an injunction as to
form.

It ’was not counched in language of injunction and,

indeed, none of the Appellants here —
QUESTION:

Do you think "injunction" in 1253

means only that which satisfies Rule 55?
MR. HELLEGERS:

Well, "injunction, " under 1253 is

a word to be construed very narrowly, as your Honor will
recall from eases like Mitchell

versus Donovan and Gunn

versus University Committee to End the War.

The

word

"injunction" as it appears in 1253 has always been subject
to this canon of very narrow construction.

It is not a

catch-all term which encompasses everything that doesn’t fit

42
neatly Into some other category.
So our contention on that is that this order comes
in two distinct parts and neither one of them satisfies the
test for injunction so the question is, why are we here and
why does this Court have jurisdiction?
Now, in talking about United States versus Griffin,
again, I brought out the point the test there wa3 whether
the order which was sought to be brought here was of a kind
of public importance that would tfarrant that.
Here, of course, the order is 13 months old.

It

has never had any practical effect in the real world so far
'

• >*V

as I can determine on any rate charge.
It has had no practical effect whatever in impeding
the commission in approving subsequent general revenue
orders and, indeed, they have had more in these 13 months
than I think they have had in any other 13-month period in
recent history.

here.
MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

Umn hron.

What do you have to say about the

Wichita holding?
MR. HELLEGERS:

Well, I would treat Wichita

along the —
QUESTION:

In terms of our Jurisdiction?

I®. HELLEGERS:

Yes, sir.

I would treat Wichita

along with all of the other cases which the Appellants
cite for the proposition that there is no practical
distinction between enjoining and setting aside an ICG
order and that that distinction has been blurred in previous
cases and I think the reason that that has been blurrad is
that in those cases there was no practical distinction.
In all of these, including Wichita, so far as I
can resaXl,there was some direct8 immediate, practical
effect from the lower court’s order.

Somebody either could

do something or he could not do something or he was enjoined
to do something or — but it had an effect on what people

could do In the real world and here we don't.

We have had

13 months and it has had no effect.
Notv, I’d like to pass very briefly to the issue of
the lower court's jurisdiction and on that I'd like to leave
my argument principally to the briefs and specifically to
some briefs that were not in this case, but to the Government
briefs in the Alabama Power and Atlantic City cases that were
before this Court five years ago, in which the commission
took a long, hard look, as they say, at the jurisdictional
Issue of the lower court and came out to a conclusion that
was

squarely in favor of us and the Government has reaffirmed

that conclusion here, saying that the Alabama Power and
Atlantic City argument that It

made is fully applicable In

this case.
The only thing that I would like to aay on that
issue in addition to that is that it seems to me that the
heart of Mr, Horsky's argument is that this suit is really
just a backdoor effort to get rate reparations without going
through the administrative procedure that i3 set up for rat®
reparations, a XIXI(l) proceeding.
That, I would submit, Is simply incorrect.
Nobody in this case has asserted that he has any
absolute right not to pay the rates as raised.

What the

argument is, is that if the commission wants to raise these
rates, and we concede that it is its discretion to do so,

that the commission has to comply with its statutory
procedural mandates and we claim that that is not the
case

here and that therefore we are entitled to have

judicial review of our claim that it is not and I would
puts
submit that that / the case on all fours with the Overton
Park case that was here four years ago where the Plaintiffs
in that case did not assert any absolute right not to have
a highway built through their park, they simply claimed
that if the Secretary of Transportation was going to approve
such a highway, he had to follow the proper procedure and
the Court, of course, held that they were entitled to
judicial review of their claim but that that did not happen
there.
Now, I’d like to move, finally, to the merits.
The central contention, it seems to me, on the
merits is that it is beyond the power of the lower court
or of any court to tell the Interstate Commerce Commission
that it has prepared an inadequate environmental impact
statement in the general revenue proceeding and that is so
even when the clear consensus of comments from sister
agencies with environmental expertise — which the Interstate
Commerce Commission Is specifically required by statute to
consult and obtain the comments from in preparing its
environmental impact statement, from the consensus of these
other agencies, this is a sadly deficient statement.

In fact, I think w® can fairly and conservatively
characterize those comments as being scathing and I'd like
to call the Court's particular attention to something that
was filed yesterday by Mr» Merrlgan which I just saw yester­
day noon for the first time.
Thi3 is Mr. Merrlgan's supplemental brief for
Appellees

National Association of Recycling Industries et al.

Unfortunately, it is in the same shade of green, or almost,
as our brief In chief but at Appendix D, which Is pages 9A

QUESTION:

MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

That's right.

All right.

MR. HELLEGERS:

On page 9A we have a letter to

Mr. Merrlgan from a deputy assistant administrator for solid
waste management programs of EPA and then we have some
correspondence between the Environmental Protection Agency
and the office of the Solicitor General in which EPA
requested permission to file a brief In this case and the

47
letter in which they requested leave to file was a fairljT
good precis, I would imagine, of what they intended to file
and when I say "scathing comments," I refer, for example,
to what is at the top of page 12A, where the Environmental
Protection Agency actually calls into question whether the
look

that the commission took at environmental effects in

this case was made in good faith.

They actually used those

words, which are words that go beyond anything that we have
said or felt that we had to say.
There are many other comments.that were made by
other environmentally expert agencies and I emphasize
again that the Commission was required to solicit their
opinions in this case and consult with them.
They are extensively cited in our brief.
QUESTION;

What is this letter we have from the

Solicitor General that we just got this morning?
MR. HELIiEGERS:

Well, I just got that this

morning, too.
QUESTION:

That refers to this supplemental brief?

MR. HELLEGERS:

It refers to this and, as I recall

it, the substance of that letter is directed to Mr. Merrigan's
allegation that C.E.Q., the Council on Environmental
Quality also sought leave to file a similar brief.

Court by the E.P.A. itself.

It had to come through

Mr. Merrigan.
Now, these comments here that I am directing the
Court’s attention to right now come from the Environmental
Protection Agency which, through its office of solid waste
management is also very actively and expertly involved in
questions of recycling of commodities and the effect of rail
rates there.
Nov/, I’d like to call the Court’s attention to
something else that was just lodged yesterday because we got
it only yesterday.
This is the Interstate Commerce Commission’s order

49
In ex parte number 310,

The service date is March 25th,

1975, which was yesterday and I'd like to call the Court’s
particular attention to page 39.
QUESTION:

Now, ’what does that one look like?

MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

It came in yesterday.

MR. HELLEGERS:
QUESTION:

It looks like this.

It came in yesterday.

Yes, sir.

39?

MR. HELLEGERS:

Page 39 of that.

And there ‘he Interstate Commerce Commission
makes the statement that it remains a basic economic fact —
this is, oh, maybe 10 or 15 lines down in the second para­
graph, right after footnote 4 — it remains a basic
economic fact

that not granting a proposed rate increase
/

for recyclables will generate a degree of positive
environmental benefit and then if you read down to footnote
five,

you find that their expert authority for the effect

of rate increases on the environment is the U. S. Environ­
mental Protection Agency, 1974.
Now, also this proposition that the — that it
lies beyond the Court’s power to tell the Commission that
its impact statement is inadequate would require the Court
in this case to disregard the history of the case which is
the history of the ICC using the word "insignificant’' like a
rubber stamp to characterise the environmental impact of

50
raising freight rates.
As we point out in our brief, the prior history
prior to this impact statement is that the ICC had never
prepared an impact statement on any rate regulation
activity of its and its device for avoiding this was that it
made a boiler plate finding in each of a great number of
cases that the proposed action would haVe no environmental
impact and the lower court found that this was "glorified
boiler plate, a mere strategem " and words to that effect and
that, of. course, is not challenged in this Court.
But the point of this is that the ICC kept using
' this word "insignificant" and so we come to the present
impact statement and lo and behold, we find a

very prolex

document and after each section the ICC tells us that the
'i

!

environmental impact of what it proposes to do -will be
"insignificant."

There is that word again.

And it doesn't give any figures to tell vrtmt it
means by "insignificant."
Now, there has been criticism of our use of the
impact statement In ex parte 295 but in ex parte 295, the
ICC finally got around to saying what it meant by "insigni­
ficant" and. it turns out that what they mean by "insignifi­
cant" is that a three percent rate increase on metal scrap
alone, not counting any other kind, will have the effect of
requiring increased consumption of electric power sufficient

51
to supply a residential city of 130,000 people or 43,000
households, assuming about three persons to a household,
according to the current census data and it turns out that
the fuel cost of generating that electricity alone is going
to be in excess of $6 million which is a figure that no one
has contested since we have used it in our briefs.
It turns out that the capital costs of creating
the generating capacity for that is in excess of $39 million.
Now, the point of these uncontested figures is
that maybe you think that
Maybe you don’t.

these figures are insignificant.

But it is a point on which there can be

disagreement and there is nothing — and I emphasize that —
there is nothing in the historical expertise of the ICC
which automatically validates its characterization of an
Insult to tjie environment or costs as being insignificant
so we have to know what they mean by insignificant.
Now, it is argued that the 295 and following
impact statements merely reaffirmed the Interstate Commerce
Commission's finding in ex parte 28l that the impacts x^ere
insignificant but the difference is that we know what
"insificant" means now and we didn't know then and, as I
said, you can differ as to whether that word ought to be
applied and other agencies have differed.
On the last page of the ex parte 295 impact
statement — I’m afraid there is only one copy, I think,

with the Court but the Department of the Interior quite
gently points out that the assumption that a change of less
than one percent in metals consumption is insignificant can
be questioned.

I think that Is a very conservative statement

and EPA, in this material that is filed at the rear of
Mr. Merrlgan’s brief, on page 14A, looks at those figures
and looks at the conclusion "insignificant" and it says that
in ex parte 295, which is certain scrap commodities, the
commission has reached conclusions contrary to those of its
cursory analysis in ex parte 28l„
Now, in conclusion, I5d like to point to

something

that has; greatly struck me about the briefs in this case that
we have gotten from Appellants and that is the distance
travelled in those briefs between the jurisdictional statements
in the original briefs

the reply briefs.

I thought that the reason that this case was
brought to this Court when I read the jurisdictional state­
ments in the opening briefs was that the lower court's
judgment was going to require things that were literally
impossible.
Now, in the reply briefs, we find that, well, they
are arguing that not only are these things not impossible
but the deficiencies have been cured since and these
supposedly impossible things have been done.
We found it argued in the opening brief that this

53

would bring general revenue proceedings to a screecning
halt.

We were not told that — there have been four or

five, depending on how you count, since that — we were not
told that the rates had gone up by 40 percent on virgin
materials and 20 percent on scrap.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

That — yes, sir?
Mr. Hellegers, I was reading over this

United States against Griffin that you cited to the Court
and that seems to go to a limited construction of the
District Courts jurisdiction rather than to a limited
construction of this Court’s jurisdiction.
I would think that would enter into the proposi­
tion that perhaps the District Court didn’t have juris­
diction, not that we don't have it.
MR. HELLEGERS:

Well, it seems to me, your Honor,

that what it is doing is taking jurisdictional language
from the Urgent Deficiencies Act which, as the Court says,
creates extraordinary jurisdiction and the words "extra­
ordinary jurisdiction" can obviously be applied as well to
this Court's jurisdiction, perhaps more so, as to the lower
courts and it is saying thrt when that language literally
followed, or blindly followed is going to lead to a result
which has no policy justification, then it will not be
followed and it seems to me that that is equally as
applicable to the question of direct appeal jurisdiction in

this Court which has always been most narrowly confined.
QUESTION:

Do you say then it is quite conceixmble

that even though Congress wanted a case to be heard by three
Judges rather than one in the District Court, it might not
have wanted it appealed directly to this Court?
MR. HELLEGERS:

Your Honor, the answer to that is

that this case was brought before a three-judge court because
we asked for an Injunction.

We asked for an injunction

against the collection of certain rates pending the com­
pletion of an adequate environmental impact statement.
Had we asked only for the relief that was, in fact,
granted, I would submit that that would have been proper to
bring before a single judge and that that would have gone to
the Court of Appeals.
Now, I would call your Honors* attention also to
the Branhoar ease which we cite in which it is held obviously
that not everything that is heard, before a three-,judge court
by virtue of that alone qualifies for direct appeal to this
Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Merrigail.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD L. KERRIGAN* ESQ.
MR. KERRIGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
X appear here today for the National Association of
Recycling Industries, your Honors.

35
This industry

represents — the trade association

represents all the processors, collectors and manufacturers
who utilize waste paper, textile wastes and nonferrous
metal scraps such as copper, lead, aluminum and so forth
in manufacturing processes,

NARI, of course, has been a party to the 28l proceedings before the commission and Intervened in the case
before the District Court and has participated in all those
proceedings since before —• I think before this case was
last before this Court*
X want to say from the very outset,your Honors,
that this case clearly does not Involve any complicated
abstract environmental issues such as Mr. Randolph seemed
to try to indicate to this Court today.
He — I think that his description of the
situation Is pretty much the same type of approach the
commission has taken.

They really simply can’t see the

forest for the trees and they haven’t tried to see the
forest.

They have been climbing over tree after tree.
There are three statutes that this Court really

has to look at when you approach this case to understand
what Congress has been trying to get this commission to do.
First is NEPA

itself.

NEPA says in the very

opening section, 4331(b) that it is the duty of the
Federal Government to u$ all practicable means consistent

56
with other essential considerations of national policy to
enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the
maximum obtainable recycling of depietable resources.
That is statute number one.
Statute number two is the Resource Recovery Act
of 1970 whereinCongress directe d

the Government to study

the transportation rate situation and the picture covering
recyclable commodities and to correct it where it dis­
criminated against recyclable5.
And then Just recently, when Congress had before
it the Railroad Reorganization Act of 1973 which was
dealing with the failing railroads in the east, it again
concluded a section 603 which directly pointed to the
Interstate Commerce Commission and directed the commission
to adopt appropriate rules to eliminate discrimination
against the shipment of recyclable materials in rate
structures where such discrimination exists.
So we start

this case with an understanding that

the commission has been clearly directed by Congress and
this

Court has a legal basis to proceed from, not a

complicated, abstract environmental basis, you have a legal
basis to proceed from to understand that the commission
simply has not been doing its job in this area and that is
what this is all about.
Now, the history in this case is that right on

57
through the rendition of its final order in ex parte 28l,
the commission plainly refused to file any impact statement
whatsoever — any impact statement that could be called an
Impact statement.

And they approved the increase on

recyclable commodities without filing anything under NEPA.
It was only when an injunction was there and then
threatened — because they would have been clearly beyond the
pale of the law

that they then reopened the case at that

point and five months later, after they had approved the
rates on recyclables already, they issued a draft statement
and seven months later, without holding any hearing whatever,
they issued the final statement which is of course before the
Court today.
Now, your Honors, to understand the real essence of
this case, I ask you pleas® to look at pages six to seven of
our main brief before this Court which is the green original
brief.

It ssts forth what the real rate picture is and what

Congress has been trying to get at with its coramission and
what this commission has been refusing to do.
In 1959, the —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll resume there

after lunch, and I think your five minutes is consumed,
Mr. Kerrigan.
[Whereupon a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o'clock noon

until 1:01 o'clock p.m.3

58
AFTERNOON SESSION
WE. CHIEF JUSTICE BUHGER:

Mr. Merrigan, you have

a minute.
MR. MERRIGAN:

Thank you very much9 your Honor.

I was directing the Court’s attention to pages
six and seven of NARI’s main brief In this case and with
the limited time I have left I can only ask your Honors to
look at those rates which are taken from the commission’s
files.
Those are the net average rates for the trans­
portation of competing recyclable waste paper and wood
pulp and competing metal scrap and ores to show how the
annual rate increases by their steady application alone can
continue to exascerbate the discrimination in those rates
year by year by year.
I also dust want to briefly say, your Honor, that
when Mr. RAndolph for the Solicitor General said that
section under — there are really different rates in these
ex parte proceedings, I would ask your Honors to look at
23 of our supplemental brief and understand that that makes
the section XIII complaint procedure absolutely no remedy
whatever because that means that the shipper in a case of
this kind must challenge rate after rate after rate and we
estimate on the basis of the railroad’s own figures that it
would take 1,000 to 3»000 ease years to challenge Just the

59
rates In the eastern district alone.

That is in our

supplemental brief.
In his closings the Solicitor General stateds "When
Congress passed NEPA, it intended to say* well, this Courts
what impact will an increase have?”

Not, did it have an

impact.
In this case we say that this is the nub of

this

casea that the impact statement was not made until after the
commission had approved the Increase and then for the first
time had looked at the impact.
Thank you.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Merrigan, does it make any difference

in the applicability of NEFA to this case that the rates are
set by the carriers rather than by the commission?
MR. KERRIGAN:

No, your Honor, we say not because

under X¥(7) the statutory scheme is that they file the rate
then it is subject to commission approval and in answer to
what Mr. Hersky said in his argument, the commission passes
not only on the — the- commission passes In a XV(7) pro­
ceedings on the lawfulness of the rates and that is what is
involved here.
We say these rates are unlawful because of the
violation of NEPA.
QUESTION:
violation of NEPA

But there has presumably been no
by the railroads.

6o
MR. MERRIGAN:

Well —

QUESTION: Because they are not subject to It.

C?3
MR. MERRIGAN:

Well, NEPA Is a draft of the

federal agency, the commission and the commission has its
statutory duty under the Interstate Commerce

Act and, of

course, unde3? NEPA, too, to perform, its function under NEPA
and this act and I don’t understand the Government to argue,
either the Government or the railroads to argue that the
commission does not have the duty to prepare an impact
statement,
That seems to be out of the question any more
that they would argue that.
They do have the obligation under NEPA and since
this is a proceeding under the Section XV(?) of the Inter­
state Commerce Act, this is a major federal action which
has to be supported by a NEPA statement because of the
Government1s involvement.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Butler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BRUCE BUTLER, ESQ.
MR. BUTLER:

Mr Chief Justice and may it please

the Court,
I’d like to summarize to the Court what we feel to
be the basic inadequacies with this statement.
These are essentially that the commission failed

61
to come to grips with central issues posed by other federal
agencies.
QUESTION:

Could you preface that by a statement

of what you understand to be the role of the Court in this
area with respect to the subject matter you Just spoke of?

MR. BUTLER:

We would suggest that the courts —

the lower courts — have an obligation to look first at
whether there .has been procedural compliance with the specific
statutory requirements of NEPA, namely, whether the commission
in this case has filed an impact statement discussing the
points outlined —QUESTION:
has complied.

Well, assume procedurally the commission

Beyond that, what is this Court supposed to

do?
MR. BUTLER:

Well, I think that that; is the real

question here, what — where does procedure end
begin?

and substance

And we would suggest that, certainlys at the bottom

end. the’ underlying rate action is clearly a substantive
matter. '
The conclusion of the commission as to whether —
is there an environmental impact?

That, *?e would also suggest,

is a eonclusionary.
Those, we would also agree that [they] should be
tested by the arbitrary and capricious standard.
The question, did the commission come to grips with

62
central Issues? we believe is a procedural matter and there­
fore, tested under the rule of reasonableness, we suggest in
our brief.
And looking at that in that manner, we feel that
the lower court was entirely correct in concluding that the
commission did not come to grips with the central issues.
CEQ —
QUESTION;

What doss that mean, "Come to grips

with the central issues"?
MR. BUTLER:
QUESTION;

Well, CEQ —
You mean, Just Ignored issues or they

dealt with them but you don’t like the way they dealt with
them?
MR. BUTLER:
QUESTION:

The- former, clearly.
And both, I gather.

MR. BUTLER;

And obviously th© second but that

is not what we are hare arguing.
We are suggesting that CEQ and EPA made numerous
comments to the federal agencies suggesting that various
matters be considered.

What is the impact on long-term

What is the impact of the underlying rate

structure?
Some of these issues such as the underlying rate
structure clearly, ty’ae commission offers a conclusion.

It

offers no supporting- data., another issue which simply does

not address the subject matter and, as evidence for this,
we would cite the comments of these five agencies.

earlier, the comments are scathing and they continue till
today.
QUESTION:

You

No, a —
That covers all the points you think

Otherwise, there has been a procedural

MR. BUTLER:

No, I think — and this was not

something that was an after-the-fact suggestion by these

various agencies♦

These are comments that were

early in the proceeding by all the — not only agencies but
the parties involved.
QUESTION:

Well, if they omit to discuss and

dispose of a suggestion by an agency expressly, you take it
there has been a procedural default?
MR. BUTLER:

Well, it is the rule of reason, I

would suggest, that you have to look at it in its
totality, how many various —
QUESTION:

Well, your answer is yes, with some

64
issues that is true.

If they don’t expressly say something

about it9 there has been a default,
MR. BUTLER:
QUESTION:

That is clear, yes.
Even if you are convinced that the

agency knew about it and rejected it, and had to reject it
in order to —
MR. BUTLER:

I think the purpose of NEPA is that

In the environmental impact statement, the commission is
to set forth what its reasoning is so that not only the
courts can judge what the issues are but NEPA is also for
the benefit of Congress and the President so that they can
judge what the basic environmental issues are and take future
actions depending on that.
If there are no further questions, I thank the
Court for its indulgence.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, RAndolph.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, ESQ.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please tha Court:
Justice White, I’d like to pick up with a question
that you just ended with.
The fact of the matter is, in this case the
District Court did not charge the commission with failing to
respond to the comments of other agencies.

What the District

65
Court said, precisely ~ on page 31A of Its opinion — is
that the commission responded but it failed to alter its
conclusions, not that it didn’t respond.
It simply failed to alter its conclusions because
the fact of the matter is that throughout this entire
impact statement, the commission responded again and again
and again to the various comments of the federal agencies.
For example, EPA, CEQ, Department of Commerce
thought that the commission should engage in a study
regarding whether increases or costs justified for each
recyclable commodity.
On page 1*19 of the Appendix, the commission
responded.

It said that burden would thrust upon the

railroads to cost-justify increased rates on each of tens
of thousands of commodities between hundreds of thousands
of points and "could ensnare the railroads in a morass of
calculations from which they would never be able to extract
themselves."
GSA said that the ICC should keep transportation
of recyclable commodities under continued surveillance.
At page 158 of the Appendix, the ICC responded
"will do so."

It is doing so in ex parte 270.

The Commerce Department, EPA and CEQ all said,
examine the present rat® structure.

At pages 2*4 to 58 of

the commission’s environmental Impact statement, the

66
commission said, "Whether the increases In rates over the
years have caused a misalignment or discrimination against
certain commodities is a matter we are studying in ex parte
270,” which is an ongoing investigation of the entire rate
structure.
Interior Department suggested that the IOC include
a table of contents in Its impact statement.

You'll see

at

Appendix page 199the ICC did so.
The Interior Department — or the CEQ said that
the ICC failed to analyse the effect on investment decisions.
The ICC responded to that at page 157*
On and on and on, this whole impact statement but
curiously enough, the ICC has responded to all these
comments.

The curious thing is the other agencies haven’t

responded to the ICG’s response.
off this dialog back

I don’t know where one cuts

and forth but it seems to me that, as

X stated originally, that the point that the District Court
made and said was the fundamental defect In the IOC’s Impact
statement — on page 3^A of the decision of the District
Court — was its failure to discuss the underlying rate
structure and CEQ said to the ICC, you ought to do that.
Now, we understand your time constraint, so do it.
What you should do is, hold down the rates on recyclablea and
continue your investigation in this other proceeding, ex
parte 270.

67
The ICC said, we don't have any power to do that
under the Interstate Commerce Act.
I take It the ICC, out of all these agencies, was
the expert on that question.
I would also like, in the Ima remaining, to bring
to the Court's attention — there has been a great deal of
talk about the supplemental brief that was filed yesterday.
The supplemental brief was filed by counsel for
MARI and it is a green— sort of an off-green color and I
would direct the Court’s attention to pages 14A to 15A of
that supplemental brief.

It is kind of buff-green in oolor.

That contains the letter from EPA that was
the
is
directed to the Solicitor General, / letter/dated, I believe,
February the *fth.

If you take that letter and compare it

to pages 10 to 11 of the SCRAP brief, you'll notice some­
thing quite peculiar.
Beginning at the bottom of page 10 of the SCRAP
brief — which is the large green copy — and carrying over
to page 12 of the SCRAP brief, there is a whole series of
quotations that I pointed out originally in my opening
argument which we think were taken completely out of context
and distorted what the commission found in later proceedings.
The exact same quotations appear in exactly the
same form in the EPA letter to the Solicitor General.
think the EPA — and I might add that we think the EPA

We

68
letter carae to the Solicitor General’s office one week before
the SCRAP brief was filed.
1 don’t think I have to say much more about that.
The other point Is that there has been a great deal
of talk about what

significance ex parte 295 has here.

The SCRAP people tell you that the commission has now
quantified its findings.

It is giving you numbers.

What they fail to point out is that, just last
week, Mr. Merrigan filed a suit — almost the same as this —
challenging ex parte 295, the commission’s later findings.
Why?

Because in ex parte 295? as in ex parte 281,

as in every general revenue proceeding the commission has
had, it has not been able to examine the underlying rate
structure which is supposedly the fundamental defect that
the District Court found.
It would be Impossible for the commission to
examine the underlying rate structure in a proceeding which
is coming now at the rate of every six months.
The District Court said that that wan the funda­
mental deficiency In the commission's decision, failure to
examine the underlying rate structure.
I repeat that the point that we want to get across
to you most emphatically is that In a general revenue pro­
ceeding, the commission cannot alter the underlying rate
structure.

All it can simply do Is look at whether the

69
increases are cost-justified, whether the revenues that the
railroads are bringing in as opposed, to their costs justify
an increase.
The ex parte 310 that was served on the Court this
morning shows that the commission's findings are clearly
correct.

The railroads suffered the greatest losses since

the Depression in the first quarter of this year.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:14 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
