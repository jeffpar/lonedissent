PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Number 73-1380 and 1666, 1667*
Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians against the Federal Power
Commission and related cases.
Mr. Wallace, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. V7ALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the Complainants, who are two
Indian Tribes, two environmental organizations and several
individuals have brought a proceeding in the Federal Power
Commission seeking to require the intervening companies to
apply for> licenses for six existing and planned thermo­
electric facilities in the so-called "Four Corners" area
of the Southwest, all of which draw their cooling waters
from various places in the Colorado River system but none
of which draw their cooling waters from any project licensed
by the Federal Power Commission.
The claim was made that the Commission has
jurisdiction, licensing jurisdiction over these plants,
both under the so-called "project works clause" and because
the plants use surplus water from government dams or at
least, arguably, some of them do.
The Commission dismissed the complaint or. the

4
basis of its long-standing interpretation that Part I of the
Act gives it jurisdiction to license only hydroelectric
facilities and not thermoelectric facilities, whether they
are fossil fuel burning facilities or atomic facilities,
that the jurisdiction under both clauses of the Act. is
limited to the licensing of project works or the use of
surplus water by hydroelectric facilities which use water
power for the generation of electricity, the power of falling
water.
On review, the Court of Appeals agreed with the
Commission in rejecting the principal contention that was
being made in the case under the project works clause, but
held that the Commission does have licensing authority with
respect to the use of surplus water by thermal electric
plants and ordered the case remanded to the Commission to
determine whether surplus water within the meaning of the
statute was being used by these facilities and the relation­
ship between the Commission's jurisdiction and the jurisdiction
of other federal agencies who have the authority over the
disposition of the water at the various projects involved in
the Colorado system.
This Court granted cross-petitions for certiorari
and by agreement of the parties, the opening briefs on all
issues were filed by the Power Commission and the intervenor
companies and I will be speaking for 20 minutes for the

5
Power Commission and Mr. Ely will be speaking for 10 minutes
for the intervenor companies.
At the outset — now, the issue, while it has not
been contested in this Court before, is not a new issue in
this Court.

In 1965, in a case entitled Federal Power

Commission against Union Electric Company9 Volume 38l U.S.,
all nine Justices addressed the issue in the context of
determining whether there was jurisdiction on the Commission
to license a pump storage plant and the case was decided on
the premise that the Commission has no licensing jurisdiction
with respect to the thermal electric facilities, a premise
that was accepted by all parties in that case.
And, previously, as the Court of Appeals pointed
out , an opinion of this Court in 1953, United States
against Public Utilities Commission — and this is
explained in the Appendix on page 89-a in footnote 123,
that opinion of this Court by Mr. Justice Reed was written
on the assumption that the Commission had no licensing
jurisdiction with respect to thermal electric facilities.
Nonetheless, at the outset9

the Complainants’

argue in this Court that the plain meaning of the statute
precludes the interpretation of the Act to which all nine
Justices subscribe in the Union Electric ease and which was
also reflected In the opinions in the Public Utilities
Commission case of Mr. Justice Reed.

6
This, obviously, is a difficult argument to make
but it is being made in the context of the statute in which
the legislative history is quite devastating to the position
that they are espousing.
Now, in our brief and, more elaborately in the
intervenors’ brief, i-/e have addressed the problems with the
language of the Act and why the language can be construed and
perhaps more reasonably should be construed on its face in
favor of our interpretation of the Act and the interpretation
previously reflected in the Court’s opinions.
I don’t propose to rehearse that during the
argument because it seems to us too late in the day after
5^ years of interpretation by the Commission after pro­
nouncements and opinions of this Court, after a major
reenactment by Congress in 1935 in light of the Commission’s
interpretations for us to think that this issue can be
decided on the bare words of the statute without looking
beyond them.
And I might say after widespread reliance during
those 5years by not only the industry but by all consumers
of electric power.
And so I think the Court of Appeals was quite right
in examining the legislative history in detail as it did with
respect to the contention under the Project Works clause and
basically, we are in agreement with that aspect of the

7
Court of Appeals' opinion and analysis which showed that
the original Part I of the Federal Power Act which i\ras
called the "Federal Water Power Act" was in its antecedents
and in its enactment concerned exclusively with giving
federal licensing authority over the development of hydro­
electric power.
The dominant concern in the enactment of that
legislation was to foster the maximum development and
utilization of hydroelectric power so as to minimise the
extent to which fossil fuels would have to be consumed in
the production of power and pollution would occur from the
burning of fossil fuels.
It was assumed by everyone that the need was to
give the regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the hydro­
electric facilities to assure that the potential of the
waters wouldn’t be wasted by shortsighted development, by
development at one point, it wouldn’t enable maximum
utilization at other points in the river system and there
were also concerns that excessive profits might be made by
the utilization of the hydroelectric sites because it was
cheaper to produce the electric power by this method and
there was also the possibility of making excessive profits
at the time the licenses expired and the facilities were
converted and so safeguards were placed in the law with
respect to that aspect of it as well.

8
And to just cite the highlights from subsequent
developments starting in 1921 in its first annual report to
Congress and repeatedly through the series of annual reports
the Commission., the Federal Power Commission indicated that
its jurisdiction under the Act — not merely under the
Project 'Works Clause, I should say, but under the Act, was
limited to hydroelectric facilities and there was indication
that Congress was well-aware of this when they reenacted the
Federal Water Power Act as the Part I of the Federal Power
Act in 1935 and that Congress deliberately decided not to
expand Commission licensing jurisdiction at that time.
This is recounted in some detail, this portion of
the legislative history on page 8 of the reply brief filed
by the intervenor companies.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Commission, in 1962, try to

get from Congress the jurisdiction that you are asserting?
MR. WALLACE:

They did in 1935 as well, your Honor,

which is recounted there and again in 1962 they sought
jurisdiction which is slightly different from what is at
issue here but it is basically jurisdiction over the
licensing of plant sites for thermal power plants —
QUESTION:

Along the river.

MR. WALLACE:

Along the river and Congress has not

yet seen fit to enact this legislation.
QUESTION:

Is that still the Commission’s policy or

9
desire?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Commission hasnft, as a

body, taken a position on that in the last few years
although there is still very considerable opinion on the
Commission that either the Federal Power Commission or some­
body should have this kind of authority to decide on the
siting for thermal electric plants.
QUESTION:

It is the view of some of the parties

here, as I understand It, at least, of some of the amici,
that with respect to this particular river the Secretary
has a great deal of authority.
Do you agree with that?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Commission — the Council

did point out in a petition for rehearing that it thought
that with respect to the use of surplus water in this case
there was no need for the Court of Appeals to reach that
that
because any authorization/might be relevant had already been
given in this case.
QUESTION:

To the Interior Department.

MR. WALLACE:
reached that issue.

But the Commission itself has not

That was something that was supposed to

under the Court of Appeals order to be decided on remand.
QUESTION:

To be considered, right.

MR. WALLACE;

That is correct.

So I am In an

ambivalent position as the Commission^ counsel as to taking

10
a position on this.
QUESTION:

That is the whole thrust of the matter,

as I remember it.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it is.

It Is not anything we

have presented in our petition for certiorari because the
jurisdictional question is what we thought was worthy of
this Court’s review rather than the particular situation on
this one river.
The jurisdictional question affects a large number of
existing and planned power facilities throughout the country
and that is what the Commission thought needed resolution in
this court.
QUESTION:

Well, the authority over the siting of

thermal electric plants that the Commission has sought i^ould
be quite independent of the existence
wouldn't it?

of surplus water,

I mean, it would be a much more generalised

authority.
MR. WALLACE:

It is quite independent of the

jurisdiction they have sought and it is quite different in its
thrust from the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals how
that the Commission has, under the Surplus Water Clause —
QUESTION:

It Is closer to the Project Works.

MR. WALLACE:

It is much closer to the Project

Works jurisdiction and the basic motivation for it as power
consumption and power needs are expanding so rapidly Is a

11
concern on the part of the Commission for adequacy and
reliability of power service.
At present, there is no agency which has cen­
tralized authority to consider alternative sites for new
thermal plants and to

authorize a particular site to the

exclusion of any other regulatory jurisdiction.

As a result,

you get serriatim litigation about the siting of thermal
projects which can result in considerable delay in the
construction of needed facilities with the risk of brown­
outs and black-outs.
Under the Court of Appeals holding, the Commission
would not have authority in authorising the use of surplus
water, to preempt other regulatory agencies, state or
federal, from the siting question.

It would merely be an

additional obstacle that would have to be overcome to the
resolution of where a particular plant that is needed can
be built so we wouldn't be having a resolution of itfhat the
Commission sees as needed under the Surplus Water Clause.
Now, I should turn, since I think the legislative
history is quite clear with respect to the first part of the
Court of Appeals opinion, I should turn to their holding on
the Surplus Water Clause.
The first thing to be said about it is that most
of the legislative history applies equally to the Surplus
Water Clause, which was in the Act from the outset and which

12
was .Included in the Commission’s generic reports that lack
jurisdiction over thermal electric facilities.

Sometimes

the reports would specify under Part I of the Federal Power
Act, which obviously included the Surplus Water Clause.
Indeed, if — and the Court of Appeals, of course,
did not have the benefit of the very compendious history of
that particular clause which the intervenors have compiled
in their supplemental brief which is very helpful in showing
the antecedents of the clause which indicate that it was
tied in very specifically with hydro-electric development.
The other thing that, in our view, may have misled
the Court of Appeals on this question is the fact that the
litigation focused so much on Section 4(E).
In the Appendix in our brief on page 63 we have set
forth Section 23(B) of the Act which probably is the section
that the complaint should have been brought under because that
is the section that says who is required to get a license.
Section 4(E) simply says what authority the
Commission has to issue a license.

Obviously the two have to

be read together.
But Section 23(B) on page 63 indicates quite clearly
on the face of the Act that there is very little warrant for
reading the two clauses differently since it says "It shall
be unlawful for any person, state or municipality for the
purpose of developing electric power to construct project

13
work or to use surplus water/5

it is rather hard to see

why the words "For the purpose of developing electric
power" would not be read the same with respect to both
clauses.'

It is the operational words that, in light of the

legislative background, indicate a limitation of the
Commission’s Jurisdiction to hydro-electric facilities.
Mow, the argument is made that under this reading
of Section 23(B) and of the similar authority in Section
4(B), the Surplus Water Clause becomes redundant and
superfluous and loses any function.
In reflecting on this matter in preparing the
argument, it seems to us that the most apparent function of
the Surplus Water Clause on the face of the Act again is
reflected in Section 23(B) on which the litigation did not
focus and I am sorry this point was not made in the briefs
but it is there on the face of the Act and that is the fact
that Section 23(B) has a grandfathering provision for any
facilities that were built under a grant prior to June 10th,
1920 that would be, by and large, statutory grants, special
statutory grants for existing facilities and the Commission's
long-standing position endorsed by the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit in a case called

Northwest

Paper Company against the Power Commission 344 F. 2nd 47,
is that the grandfathering clause is an authorization for
facilities existing at that date to continue operation

without a license from the Commission so long as none of the
project works are replaced, without a license under the
Project Works Clause.
But then, in the event — and the Commission has
not had occasion to actually apply this — in the event a
dam would be built subsequently upstream from which surplus
water would flow to this project, there would be Commission
jurisdiction only under the Surplus Water Clause so that the
entire river system would be brought under regulation to
maximize the hydro-electric potential of the entire system
because, obviously, the flow has to be regulated from one
project to another to maximize the utilization of all of
them.
And, similarly, the

surplus water or water power

seems to us just to refer to either the use of the surplus
water doivnstream or to the surplus water poorer site where it
is falling at the dam itself.
QUESTION:

Where its use is for cooling purposes and

is the water consumed or is it all returned at a higher
temperature to the —
MR. WALLACE:

It is consumed.

Some water is

consumed by thermal plants and this is the basic difference
between the use of the water by thermal plants and by hydro­
electric plants.

Hydro-electric use is basically a non­

consumptive use and the Commission has not been in the

15

business of being the arbiter between competing demands for
consumption of water in the river system.
QUESTION:

But this is cooling water, isn’t it?

MR. WALLACE:

It Is cooling water but it is

consumed in the process.
QUESTION:

Some of it at least is returned to

the river.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

At a higher temperature,

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Some of it is returned.

Yes and some of it is consumed.

Notv, how is it consumed?

MR. WALLACE:

Through evaporation, the heating

of it.
QUESTION:

Maybe it is heat loss.

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

My time has expired.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. WALLACE:

I don’t want to take his.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ely.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTHCUTT ELY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
MR. ELY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
QUESTION:

Mr. Ely, before you commence, would

you inform us as to the status of these plants?

At the

16
time the suit was brought, my understanding is that two oi
them were operational.
MR. ELY:

They are all operational except for the

Kaiparowits Plant, which is still in the planning stage,
your Honor.
QUESTION:

An injunction is sought, what would

he the consequences of an injunction?
MR. ELY:

The injunction vfhich was sought, the

order asked for in the Federal Power Commission was to halt
their operation or construction until the license should be
obtained and pending the determination of this case.
QUESTION:

How long does it normally take to obtain

a license?
MR. ELY:

These

SOme 23 percent of the

total power supply for 19 million people in the Southwestern
states.
The alternative use of the — have I answered your
question, sir?

17
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes, you have.
The alternative use of the 250,000 acre

feet which would be consumed by these plants in the cooling
process evaporation, if used In agriculture, which the
states of the Colorado River Basin have a right to do in
perpetuity if it is not used in industry here, that 250,000
acre feet would support the land limitation laws something
under 200 farm families.
The judgment decision rests with the Secretary of
the Interior and x»d.th the states as to whether the water
resources shall be used for agriculture or industry,
whether some 19 million people shall be protected against
black-outs and brown-outs by the utilization of this coal
of the Indian reservations to generate power and to use the
waters of the Colorado River In the cooling process.
That decision is entrusted to the Secretary of
the Interior and the water is apportioned to the states by
compacts to which he is subject.
The Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction
to overrule this value judgment.

If it were to grant a

surplus water license, it x^ould be a nullity because these
plants have, as the statutes require, four statutes,
contracts with the Secretary of the Interior for the use of
the water from the government dams involved here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ely, I am not — I think you said —

18
maybe I missed it, but it seemed to me you said two somewhat
inconsistent things, A) that the decision was up to the states
is how the water* was to be used that was allocated to them
and then I think you said it was up, the decision was up to
the Secretary of the Interior.
MR. ELY:

Well, this is understandable that there

would be confusion, your Honor.

The Colorado River Compact,

as you may recall, apportions in perpetuity the water for
consumptive use to the upper basin and the lower basin.
The statutes under which the dams are built,
Hoover Dam, Glen Canyon, the Navajo, are the three involved
here,

prescribe that no person shall have the right to the

use of the stored water except by contract with the Secretary
of the Interior and he, of course, is subject to the

compact

that I have mentioned on the other law of the river.
QUESTION:

But as to the — let's assume that the —

a certain amount of water is allocated to the state.

Then is

it up to the — is the state free to decide how that water is
going to be used?
MR. ELY:

Yes, the states prepare plans which are

submitted to the Secretary and as a practical matter, these
are worked out in concert.

The statute says, designated to

the Secretary superceding any authority the Commission may
have once had for comprehensive planning, the job of preparing
comprehensive plans for utilization of these water resources

19
but in concert with the states.
QUESTION:

So your point is that whatever

jurisdiction the Commission may or may not have in this
area on other rivers, at least with respect to water from
the Colorado River it has none because It has been superceded.
MR. ELY:

Precisely, your Honor, superceded both

with respect to the function of the surplus water license
that is held now by the water contract vrith the Secretary,
superceded as to the planning function of the Commission.
QUESTION:

But it is possible, I suppose, to say

that whatever the powers of the Secretary might be, they
don’t reach licensing a steam plant.
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:

I think — yes.
And that hoitfever much the Secretary or

the state might want to have a steam plant built, perhaps
che Power Commission can say, we don’t want a steam plant
there.
MR. ELY:
correct.

Yes.

Your Honor, I think you are

The project — the decision on the Project Works

Clause in our view ends this case.

If you decide that a

steam plant does indeed constitute project vrork, then It
would require a license.
'

QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes.
It would get its water by contract \vith

20
the Secretary of the Interior for cooling and. not by surplus
water license.
If, however, you decide that a steam plant is not
in the category of project works, this case ends because the
Surplus Water Clause is not an alternative ground for
licensing in this Colorado River case, whatever it may be
elsewhere.
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:

Because of the powers of the Secretary.
Correct.

Exactly, sir.

Well, it isnJt just the powers of the

Secretary, it is also a matter of state law and it may
depend on a law of the state, I take it, as to whether a
particular plan can be approved.
MR. ELY:
Rehnquist.

This is correct in a sense, Mr. Justice

If there is a competing claim for water for

industry, steam plants, water for breaking up slag in a
copper smelter, whatever, as against agriculture, the state,
in the first instance, would approve or disapprove this
appropriation or this request for water.

But neither

competitor could get the water out of a government dam witho ut a contract with the Secretary and —
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Because of the compact.
The compact reserves to the states the

apportionment, the decision how to use the water.
they want

But if

water out of the government dam, then, as this

21
Court held in Arizona versus California, as you will recall
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes.
— the Secretary has a final power to

say which user within each state shall get water from that
dam by contract.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And the power to allocate shortages.

MR. ELY:

And the power — well, the Congress may

overrule that.
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

It hasn't yet.
Well, vie think it has.

MR. ELY:

MR. ELY:

Exactly.

It has addressed itself to it.
Yes.
Well, it certainly doesn't mean that

the Secretary owns the water.
MR. ELY:

No.

This is — this is correct.

The

stored water, the Court says — this was in an earlier
Arizona versus California case, says in effect, Congress has
in effect, appropriated the — unappropriated the surplus
water, impounded it and directed that no person may use it
save by contract.

This is with respect to water in excess

of that which has been appropriated, as we read it.
In

any event, no matter what — may I say that

22
before I — I'd like to reserve a few minutes, if l may, for
rebuttal.
We are in total accord with what the Solicitor
General has said about the Project Works Clause and about the
Surplus Water Clause and the merits.

My point is, you won't

reach the Surplus Water issue if you decide the private
court below was right on the Project Works on the Colorado.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Ely.

Mr. Brecher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. BRECHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF CHEMEHUEVI TRIBE OF INDIANS ET AL
MR. BRECHER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
My name is Joe Brecher, representing the Chemehuevi,,
Cocopah Tribe of Indians, the Sierra Club, several individual
Navahoes and the Committee to Save Black Mesa.
This case involves perhaps the quintessential
environmental nightmare that this country has experienced
in the Four Comers poxtfer plants in the Black Mesa stripmining operation and it involves also a context of one of the
most blatant calls for judicial legislation I have ever
witnessed on the part of the power companies and the
government.
The language of the statute involved here could

23
be no more clear that the facilities involved in this case
are covered by

Section 4(E) of the Federal Power Act.

There can be no doubt that they are utilizing
surplus water from the

government dam for the purpose of

producing electric power.
I would like to emphasize this point at the outset
that this is not merely cooling water in the same sense
that water in an automobile radiator cools the engine-

The

water that is used in an electric power plant is an essential
part of the power production process itself.

Without the

cooling water* power production at these points would go
down 20 or more percent* the plants would be inefficient
and they could not be built.
So the water used in the thermal plants involved
in this case is an inherent part of the production process
and therefore, in a very real sense, this water is being
used to produce electric power rather than to cool machines
which are producing power by other means.
just
QUESTION: Will you/summarize that again as to the
difference of how they are used other than in cooling?
MR. BRECHER:

Yes.

Although it is used for cooling*

the cooling process itself actually results in more megawatts
QUESTION:
MR. BRECHER:

Yes.
— being produced because it makes the

turbines turn — spin faster and —

24
QUESTION:

Yes, more efficient.

MR. BRECHER:

— more megawatts come out and you

could not have a thermal plant in this day and age without
cooling water.
QUESTION:

How much water of the cooling water is

consumed?
MR. BRECHER:

All of it, your Honor, and that is

an important part —
QUESTION:

None is returned to the river?

MR. BRECHER:

Yes, except for the Four Corners

plant, all of these plants will evaporate all the water
that is withdrawn from the river and that is why the Court
of Appeals found below that thermal plants will have more
of an effect on the navigable capacity and the hydro
potential of a stream than would a hydro plant.
QUESTION:

A hydro doesn’t, ultimately, use any

water.
MR. BRECHER:

That is correct so in terms of the

power potential in a stream, the operations of thermal
plants

actually would have much more of an effect and would

actually deplete the amount of water available for down­
stream hydro production.
This would not be true for a hydro plant.
QUESTION:

It uses it but it doesn’t consume it.

MR. BRECHER:

Yes.

That is correct.

25
QUESTION:
Surplus

You are directing yourself now to the

Water Clause?
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes, as well as the —

Not the work projects?

MR. BRECHER:

Yes, I think that they are — I am

addressing myself to both.
QUESTION:

But at this point in your argument to the

Surplus Water Clause, as I understand you.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, your Honor.

Yes.

Now, we have seen — not in this Court

but in other courts there has been litigation about the use
of the water for cooling purposes and one of the major com­
plaints was that it raised the temperature, I think in one
case, of the river 20 percent because the water returned to
the river from which it was taken for the cooling process at
a much higher temperature.
Now, are you sure that you are correct when you
say that none of the water is returned after the cooling
process?
MR. BRECHER:

Yes.

Yes, your Honor.

In western

rivers, especially the Colorado, which has a high salinity
problem, the water, when it is used for cooling, the salts
that are already in the water become more

concentrated said

if that water were to be released to the stream in addition
to the thermal problem, which you have recognized, there

26
would also be a problem of increased salinity in the river
and since salinity levels in the Colorado River are already
at a very high level, none of these plants are permitted by
the Secretary of the Interior under his water service
contracts to return this water to the river.
Thus, the Colorado River, which is the most overallocated river in the world, is further depleted by the
activities in these plants.
QUESTION:

Well, what do they do with the water

if they don't — with the excess if they don't return it to
the river?
MR. BRECHER:

They evaporate it in large cooling

ponds which are located adjacent to the plants and it is
evaporated by sunlight and that is a major portion of the
plants' sites are devoted to cooling ponds.
QUESTION:

Evaporating tanks.

MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And is that only to deal with the

salinity problem?
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, your Honor, that is the main

purpose of that.
QUESTION:

So that in a river — dealing with

rivers where there is no such salinity problem, there is no
barrier, chemically or otherwise, to putting the water
back in and that is done, is it not, generally?

27
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, it is.

That is general —

however, I think that this type of situation wefll see
accelerated because many of the large new thermal power
plants and the new phenomenon, the energy complex with which
we are dealing here exists only in the west and

salinity

in rivers is a western water problem which is becoming more
and more apparent and this is true not only on the Colorado
but on the Yellowstone River in Montana which is another
major energy complex source which wlll soon have problems
very similar to the Colorado River and although the Northern
Great Plains coal development situation has not reached the
epic proportions of the Colorado River situation, it will
soon if plans that are now afoot go into effect so that we
will be seeing this type of operation, thermal plants which
deplete water resources.
This will become much more common as western coal
and energy is developed further.

This problem is in its

infancy and we are seeing the first blush of it now.
Now, I mentioned the fact that the power companies
and the government are arguing flagrantly for judicial
legislation and this is what they argue:
Although the literal language of the statute quite
obviously covers the facilities involved here, there should
be read into the statute a proviso that says, none of

this

language shall apply to steam or thermal electric power plants.

28
What is the basis for this additional language
which they claim should be involved here?
No canon of statutory construction that I know of
allows it and, in fact, several important

canons to which

this Court has long adhered would militate against the
addition of this language.
First there is the plain meaning rule.

Now, the

plain meaning rule is based on very sound traditions of the
judicial construction.
First, the language of a statute should be
understandable to and accessible by the common man and the
common lawyer, I may add.

The material which is relied on

here to vary that meaning, as Mr. Justice Jackson pointed
out eloquently throughout his career in this Court, is
available only to a few legal specialists located in the
larger cities.
I myself had a very difficult time working in
Denver of getting my hands on the material which is cited
in the supplement and what — if the plain meaning rule is
varied in this way, it means that only a few specialists
are going to be able to interpret the statute which
originally was designed to aid the public,to be understan­
dable by the public and we — we don't claim that the plain
meaning rule should govern over all sense.
Obviously, if the literal language of the statute

29

is completely at variance with what the framers of the
statute had in mind, or if it would lead to absurd or
impractical consequences, then x^e must explicate the statute,
we must go behind it to see what Congress had in mind and,
indeed, this Court has recognised that.
But that is a very narrow exception to the very
well-established rule and we maintain that in this present
case there is no reason for applying that exception.
Obviously we don't have an absurd or Impractical
consequence by giving the Federal Power Commission juris­
diction, either under the Surplus Water Clause or under the
Projects Work Clause over steam power plants.
In fact, the Commission itself has asked for this
jurisdiction repeatedly so it certainly would not be absurd
and it certainly would not be impractical and, indeed, the
Commission has stated that, based on what it conceives as
its

present statutory mandate, this additional activity,

would fit in well, would complement itself well with the
statutory mandate as it now exists.
Now, do we have — if steam plant licensing were
allowed, do we have a situation where the purposes of the
Act would be violated or violence would be done to them?
Again, no, because one of the — perhaps the pri­
mary purpose of the Act, as is mentioned by the power companies
and the government, was to promote hydroelectric development

30

and v;e don’t quarrel with that.
We do believe that hydroelectric development was
uppermost in the minds of Congress when they enacted the
Federal Power Act.
But there were other social phenomena that they
attempted to take care of in the very same legislation.
Several threads of thought, that conservationists in the
early 1900’s had been working on came together in the
Federal Power Act and two other purposes should be borne in
mind.
First was the general purpose to achieve compre­
hensive development of the nation’s waterways.

Indeed,

one of the immediate statutory antecedents of the Federal
Power Act was an act

creating a Waterways Commission to

unify the development of our rivers for purposes having
nothing to do with povrer, having to do with irrigation and
other uses and although we do not contend that the Federal
Power Act deals with the use of water for other than power
production purposes, definitely it was the sense of
Congress that unified development of the nation’s waterways
was an important purpose of the Federal Power Act.
A second important purpose was to make sure that
private power companies were not allowed to appropriate for
themselves without the government’s supervision and, in
appropriate cases, without appropriate charges, the

31
power potential in navigable streams.
In the present case, in order to effectuate those
two purposes behind the Federal Power Act, that is, compre­
hensive development of waterways and making sure that the
public’s property \^as protected, regulation of thermal power
plants is absolutely essential.
There is going to be no more hydroelectric
development in this country of any consequence and the
waterways of this country used in connection with power will
be used only in connection with thermal plants.
-

If the construction argued for

by the power compan­

ies and the government is allowed to continue, the power
companies will have achieved by the back door what the
Congress had set out to stop them from doing in 1920.
That is, appropriate for themselves without any
government supervision or control the hydro potential in
navigable streams.

They will do that by sucking all of the

water out of the river and not making it available for down­
stream dams.
QUESTION:

Now, where a government dam isn’t

Involved, where there isn’t a surplus water issue, you would
think that the — you would say that the Secretary of
Interior has no jurisdiction either.
MR. BRECHER:

No, sir, we recognize fully the

Secretary’s jurisdiction, but we do not think It precludes

32

the procedures.
QUESTION:

I understand that, but what if there

isn't a dam involved?
MR. BRECHER:
below was wrong.

Then we believe that the court

We believe that the Project Works Clause

would still govern and the literal language of that clause
would require —
QUESTION:

Yes, but how about your statement

that there is no government regulation interposed between
a power company and the use of the water in the navigable
streams.
MR. BRECHER:

That is generally true.

Except for

the limit of exception for the Colorado River and a few
other rivers where there is special legislation dealing
with it,

there is no legislation and, indeed, that was

recognized.
QUESTION:

So that’s what my question was then,

except in those special — in those circumstances, does the
Secretary of the Interior have any power?
MR. BRECHER:

No, your Honor, he has that power

only —
QUESTION:

That was my question.

MR. BRECHER:

I'm sorry.

He has that power only

because of the Law of the Colorado River as it is developed
but that is not the usual case.

33
QUESTION:

Well, suppose you have water stored

behind a dam and in the western states that isn’t In the
Colorado system?

Don’t you have to at least have a contract

with the Bureau of Reclamation or approval of the Bureau to
take water out from behind that dam?
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, you do, in most cases, either

from the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps of Engineers or
whatever the governing agency is.
QUESTION:

So there is federal regulation of some

sort of removal from water behind a dam, quite apart from
whether it is the Colorado River or not.
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, your Honor, but xve believe that

that type of regulation — there are two types of regulations
which have been recognized by the courts and I would call
the type of regulation you are speaking of political regulation
as opposed to Agency regulation.
The consequences are quite different.
There is no public participation, for example, in
a decision by the Secretary to allocate water.
cannot present witnesses.

The public

It cannot cross-examine.

cannot participate in proceedings.

It

There is no Judicial

review and it is virtually unfettered discretion on the part
of the federal agency.
In contrast, before the Federal Power Commission,
the public has very well-defined rights to participate in

34
the proceedings and, in fact, if those rights had been
exercised in this case, we wouldn’t have the terrible Pour
Corners situation we have where the siting of these plants
was done on a helter-skelter basis without considerations
of national policy which the Federal Power Commission under
the dictates of this Court in the High Mountain Sheep case
has said is so important so that, although it is regulation
and there is some government participation, there is no
public participation and one of the main thrusts of the
Federal Power Act was to make sure that the public, not
just the government j had participated — was able to
participate in the decision-making as to how our water
would be used.
QUESTION:

Well, what about — now, what about on

the Colorado or some other place in the west, if the
Secretary is going to make a decision, does he have to
comply with the Environmental Protection Act?
MR, BRECHER:

Yes, he does.

He has to comply

with the National Environmental Policy Act but the pro­
tections

available to the public under that Act are far

different from those under the Federal Power Commission and
they are —
QUESTION:

Well, they are different but it

doesn’t mean that the public has no participation.
MR. BRECHER:

Well, they have after-the-fact

35
participation only.

They may comment on an environmental

Impact statement but they can have no substantive change.
There is no substantive input from that.
All that is required is that an impact statement
be filed under NEPA but once the statement details the
environmental disaster, the Secretary is free to go ahead
regardless of the consequences under NEPA and that is an
important distinction.
QUESTION:

What was the timing with respect to the

bringing of this suit in relation to the building of the
plants?
MR. BRECHER:

When the suit was filed, one plant

was in full operation.

Pour of the other plants were just

beginning construction and that is why we asked for an
injunction originally.
Obviously, at this point, we are not going to ask
that these power plants that are so important in producing
power for the west be shut down.
QUESTION:

What are you asking?

MR. BRECHER:

At this point we would ask that the

Kaiparowits plant, which is in the planning stage, should be
held up until a license is granted and that operatiora of the
other plants could go on while the licensing proceedings took
place.
You see, under the Federal Power Act —

36
QUESTION:

But you would oppose the granting of

the licenses?
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, we would, or at least vie

would — we would advocate that conditions be attached to
the license to clean up some of the environmental mess
which has been associated with these plants and which the
so-called "regulation" of the other federal agencies has
not obtained at all.

The Environmental Protection Agency

has found at one time or another that every single one of
these plants is violating clean air statutes.
There have been massive outcries by virtually
every government agency about one or another environmental
defect.
Nonetheless, the plants go forward and this shows
the difference in quality between the so-called ’'regulation"
of the Secretary under his contract authority and the kind
of regulation one would have if the Federal Power Commission
were involved because there are sub —
QUESTION:

Well, if the plants violate clean air

statutes, can’t they be prosecuted under those statutes?
MR. BRECHER:

Well, they have been but the

go on, the plants continue violating the standards and so
far there has been remarkably little action.

The Mojave

plant, for example, has been given four or five variances
so far and the end of that process is nowhere in sighto

37
It is being contested but nothing is being done.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no question about what

the construction of the act has been insofar as the
Federal Power Commission is concerned up to this date.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.

And if somebody applied to them for a

license, they wouldn't give them a license because they said
we have no power to give a license.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And people go forward on that

assumption and would you suggest the plant could then be
required to get a license and then, perhaps, it be denied
and the plant closed down?
MR. BRECHER:

I think that is a theoretical

possibility, your Honor but very unlikely under the circum­
stances of these cases.
QUESTION:
unlikely.

Well,

I didn’t ask whether it was

I asked whether that was your contention, that it

could be closed down without some kind of compensation or
something.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.

What is correct?

MR. BRECHER:

The assumption that you stated that

the plants could be closed down If the Commission found that
a license should not be granted under the Federal Power Act.

38
However, we have many

this Court has come up

with many situations where the law changed and retroactive
licensing was reauired and we believe that this would be just
another case of the same kind.
A private Individual is not allowed to rely on a
misconstruction of the statute by an agency and if that
misconstruction is corrected, then it must abide by the law
regardless of whatever reliance it placed in the law if it
was wrong.
QUESTION:

Even to the point of dismantling the

plant, to get down to the hard realities?
Or terminating its use?
MR. BRECHER:

I suppose so, your Honor, although,

frankly, I don't think any of the parties in this particular
case would argue for that result.

Obviously, we are

realists here, too and we are not out to disappoint the
Southwest.
QUESTION:
principles here.

Well, but you are arguing some legal

We have to deal with it on that basis,

don't we, not on the basis of ivhat some people might do.
MR. BRECHER:

Yes, I think that is correct; that

legal principle, although It sounds hard,

that is the

correct one to be argued here, that, even though they had
this reliance on this improper Interpretation of the law,
they would be liable, in any event, to have their plants

39
dismantled if that were required.
Nov/, when we turn to the legislative history which
is supposed to preclude the plain meaning of the statute, we
find that that history consists of a negative rather than a.
positive.

Nowhere have they pointed to a single instance in

which any member of Congress

said that steam plants are not

to be licensed.
Instead, they point to the fact that steam plants
were not mentioned or, if they were, they v/ere mentioned in
other contexts and they draw from that the Inference that *
therefore, steam plants are not to be licensed under the Act.
We believe that this violates a premise that
Chief Justice Marshall stated way back in the 1830*s which is
that, if you have a situation that appears to be covered by
statutory language and that particular situation was not
mentioned by Congress, it is not enough to say that it was
not mentioned.
There must be an affirmative showing that Congress,
had it been confronted with the facts involved in the case,
would have said, no, we do not want to regulate.
Now, I would lake to ask this Court to imagine the
Conservationists’ Congress of 1919 and 1920 being confronted
with the Kaiparowits power plant using 102,000 acre feet of
scarce Colorado River water, water which would then not be
available at four downstream federal hydroelectric projects,

40
water which would be depleted forever from the river
system, water which would be necessary for the intelligent
planning of that system and ask whether, in view of the
purpose of Congress to promote comprehensive development of
waterways and to assure that private power interests do not
appropriate public resources, whether the Congress would
have said — whether we can say with assurance, Congress
would have said no, we do not want to regulate this power
plant.
And I maintain that we cannot say that on the
strength of the legislative history that has been offered
to us.
Now, it is argued that the Secretary’s power on
the Colorado River supercedes any power that the Federal
Power Commission could have.

We believe that this is the

weakest 'argument that has been advanced by the power
companies for a number of reasons.
One, the two main statutes relied.on by them,
the Boulder Canyon Project Act and the Colorado River
Storage Project Act both take away FPC jurisdiction, either
for a limited time on the Colorado or for limited space on
the Colorado but, by implication would retain jurisdiction
on the rest of the river.
The Boulder Canyon Project Act says that the
Commission's jurisdiction on the Colorado shall temporarily

41
cease until the Act shall have been ratified.
That Acts of courses was ratified in 1921 and so
by implications FPC jurisdiction continues.
In the Colorado Storage Project Act, the Congress
went to the trouble of excluding FPC

jurisdiction on the

short stretch of the river between the Grand Canyon and Lake
Mead.

If there were no jurisdiction there originally, why

would it be necessary to take the jurisdiction away in the
statutory context?
Furthermore» the Commission itself has held
hearings, licensing hearings and those hearings have been
participated in by the Secretary concerning this very
portion of the Colorado River involved here.
The proposed Marble Canyon Dam in 1962 was on this
very stretch of the river.
QUESTION:

That was a hydroelectric proposal.

MR, BRECHER:

Yes, but their contention, your

Honor, is that there is no FPC jurisdiction, period and,
obviously, there is because both of the parties involved
have, in fact, participated in that kind of proceeding.
Furthermore, even if we are to accept this
argument, two of the power plants involved in this case, the
Four Corners

and Huntington Canyon plants are not covered

by the contract with the Secretary.
service contracts with the Secretary.

They do not have water
They have obtained

their water by the usual methods from the states involved so
that the Secretary’s jurisdiction, even if it existed,
could not supercede FPC jurisdiction as to those two power
plants.
In short, there is very — and, finally, I may
add, if this

Court will accept the Nantahala Power case

which involved the TVA and the Federal Power Commission,
we have had a situation very similar.
As you are aware, the Tennessee Valley Authority
has very, very broad authority over the allocation and
distribution of water in the Tennessee VAlley, far more
power than the Secretary of Interior exercises in the
Colorado.
Nonetheless, it was held in the Nantahala Power
case that the Federal Power Commission still had a voice in
deciding the allocation of that water,

at least as far as

power plants were concerned.
Even more important, the type of regulation being
done by the Secretary, the scope and concerns the Secretary
has, is different from that of the Federal Power Commission.
For one thing, the Commission is a national
commission and it can take into account and, indeed, is
required to take into account, more than the Secretary is
in awarding his contracts.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t the Secretary a National

43
Secretary, too?
MR. BRECKER:

Yes, he is, your Honor, but he hasn’t

acted as one in the context of these cases because he is
allowed — he hasn’t, for example, ever done what the
Commission could do, namely saying, yes, you may have the
water but don’t locate the plants at this particular spot.
Move them some place where the area is less scenic.
QUESTION:

But that is j'usfc a complaint about the

way the authority has been exercised.

I don’t see how that

bears on the existence of the authority.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Well —

I mean, to say that one is national

and the other isn't, you have gcc a Secretary appointed by
the President.

You have got Federal Power Commissioners

appointed by the President.
MR. BRECHER:

Well, the difference is that the

Secretary’s authority is confined to the Colorado River Basin
whereas the Federal Power Commission oversees the entire
power industry throughout the nation and the Federal Power
Commission may well say, for example, yes, we should mine
western coal, we should use it for producing electric power
but let’s not put it in the Colorado River system, let’s use
some other river system which isn't so badly overburdened
and —
QUESTION:

What river system would you use, other

44
than the Colorado to supply the people in the Southwestern
states?
MR. BRECHER:

There are a number of alternative

sources such as using seawater, for example or using the
Great Salt Lake or, as a matter of fact, there are several
power plants now being planned in southeastern Utah which
will use ground water and agricultural run-off rather than
water from the mainstream of the Colorado River.
And these are alternatives that could have been
applied back in the 1960’s when the Secretary was making
his decision as to these power plants and if there had
been an PPC proceeding, those alternatives could have been
developed by public intervenors such as we are and perhaps
a system that was —
QUESTION:

How exactly do you return waters that

weren’t used in the river — in the plant?
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

The return water?

Prom irrigation.

MR. BRECHER:

A lot of it goes back into the

river and contributes to the salinity problem and now it is3
under the plans that are now being formulated, it will be
evaporated and so salinity will be decreased.
QUESTION:

But the water is still used up.

MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

What authority is there that precludes

45
the return of that cooling water to the Colorado River?

Is

it state, federal. Secretary of the Interior, Federal Power
Commission?
'

Who stops them from returning it?

MR. BRECHER:

Well, for these particular plants,

it is a condition of the Water Service contracts that the
Secretary entered into with the power plants.
Presumably, the Environmental Protection Agency
would have adopted similar regulations under its general
water pollution control authority, under the Water Pollution
Control Act.
QUESTION:

The return of this water, which you have

said is a matter peculiar to the Colorado River, the return of
it would not impair its function for producing new power
downstream, would it?
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BRECHER:
were returned.

If the water were returned?

That would depend on how or where it

For example, if the water by-passed the

government dam, which is a conceivable situation, and that
water were not allowed to floitf over in an intermediate dam,
yes, it would — it would —
QUESTION:

Well, the salinity problem is — is it

not entirely a pollution problem?
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, the salinity problem is basically

46
not pollution in the ordinary sense but it is the obligation
of the United States to deliver a certain amount of water to
Mexico of a certain standard and because of all the salinity,
the Mexicans complain that the water isn't up to standard.
MR. BRECHER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but our clients are also —

It isn't aesthetic.

Water that is

too saline is no good for irrigation.
MR. BRECHER:

That's right and, in fact, our

clients are vitally affected by that.

The Cocopah Tribe is

located just above the Mexican border and the water that they
receive down the river, by the time it gets to them is so
saline that a lot of crops are already precluded from growth
there so they have a vital interest in that, too.
I think it is a particularly deadly kind of
pollution in the southwest.

It is the most deadly kind

because other types of pollution can be dealt with by
treatment but dealing with salinity is a very difficult
and expensive problem, almost insurmountable.
QUESTION:

Yet, It doesn't affect the drinking

quality of the water.

People drink saline water.

MR. BRECHER:

Well, if you have ever tasted Los

Angeles water, you know that it is —
QUESTION:

Well, there are 20 million of them

drinking it.
QUESTION:

A lot of people do taste it every day.

47
MR. BRECHER:

That is true for the Colorado River

water probably above the Parker Dam, but below the Parker Dam,
you can’t drink it.

I don’t think anybody drinks it there

and bottled water is — in Yuma, bottled water is the rule
rather than the exception.

I know my clients rarely drink

that stuff.
QUESTION:

Yuma has a city waterworks that

certainly takes water out of the river.
MR. BRECHER:

But I think it is treated for

salinity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ely, you have about

three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORTHCUTT ELY, ESQ.
MR. ELY:

Your Honor, to dispose first of some of

the questions last asked about salinity, I will ask your
attention to page 114s of the supplement to our brief which
quotes from the findings of fact in the case called Jicarl11a.
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Well, give us a little time to find it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ely, 114?
ll4s of the Supplement to the brief.
Yes.
This quote from the findings of fact

of the District Court in a case in which all of the
Complainants here were were parties except the two Indian

48
tribes and it points out that the effect on salinity of the
Colorado River by the small quantities of water which will
be consumed here is not measurable.
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

What paragraph?
It starts at the top of the page, 114s.

All of the water consumed here will affect
salinity at the Imperial Dam, the lower end of the river,
by .8 to 1.2 percent.

It will be nearly if not impossible

to detect these increments with standard measurements of
chemical water quality.
The quality of water there now is low.

It has

869 parts per million.
QUESTION:

This is because the water is not going

to be returned to the river, isn’t it?
MR. ELY:

Yes.

Let me clear that up, your Honor.

The quantity —
QUESTION:

I would think if water is taken out and

not returned, then I don’t see hox* anybody could possibly
conjecture that the salinity would be increased.
MR. ELY:

Exactly.

The burning up of the water

in the evaporating process in the cooling toilers doesn’t
add any salt to the river.
QUESTION:

It just takes the water out of the

river.
MR. ELY:

It takes it out of the river and leaves

ii 9
it in the evaporating ponds as salt calce.

It is taken out

of the river but the water is taken out, too and so there is
less fluid to dilute the salt that comes into the river down­
stream from the irrigation projects.
QUESTION:

Well, that is self-evident; I would

think,, Mr. Ely.
MR. ELY:

Yes.

I mean, there is nothing to argue

about and besides, if you are really going to determine the
right —
QUESTION:

What would be the effect on salinity

if the water was returned to the stream and not evaporated?
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:

Virtually the same, your Honor.
Well, then, what underlies the condition

in the Secretary's contract?
MR. ELY:

Because the environmentalists were

concerned about the heating effect of the water that would
come back from the cooling towers.
QUESTION:

So you say it is not a chemical problem

at all, it is just a heat problem.
MR. ELY:

Exactly so.

in the Environmental Act.

Heat is named as a contaminant

They didn't want the water heated

up and at Navajo we spent $5 million to avoid returning this
water to the stream, which is the cheapest thing to do.
Our reply brief points out that the cooling water
used in the United States, the greater part of it still is a

50
once-through flow as it goes back to the stream so in 1971,
the last year for which the Commission published data, over
99*2 percent of the water diverted for cooling was returned
to the stream9 but heated up.
In some areas, they don't want this hot water and
the pressure Is put on the power plants to build cooling
towers.

At great expense, we have done that.
So this is, if I may say so, a rabbit trail.

If

you were going to truly litigate quality of water here, the
right of a user in the Lower Basin to complain of uses by
these five power plants in the Upper Basin, even though the
five plants were within the apportionments made by the
Colorado River Compact,

you xvould have to have the states

that are parties to that Compact here to respond to the
charge that even though you are within your quantities, you
are affecting our quality.

You can't have what was

apportioned to you.
QUESTION:

All this is very far afield from the

issues in this case.
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:

Oh, it is.
And I grant you that the —
It is, indeed.
— Bench here has invited this detour

and frolic.
MR. ELY:

Yes, it Is, your Honor.

51
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes,
The -- let me come to another point., on

the literal wording matter.
We3 in our briefs, we have traced some 16 places
in the statute where the language selected relates only too
obviously to hydroelectric projects, totally inappropriate
for steam plants.
The definition of project works, you'd have to
include references to ash handling plants, coal pipelines and
so on.

None of it is there.

Everything is for hydro.

There

is, in their legislative history, at least one statement by
Congressman Taylor, later chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, that, "Of course, we are not including steam
plants in this Bill, are we?"

and the answer was, "You are

right. "
This is discredited because the man answering was
a utility executive but what of it?
In 1920, when this Act was passed, virtually all
of the —■ the greater part of the power production was by
steam, as it is noif.
By the time the 1935 Congress rejected the
Commission’s request for authority to license steam plants,
there were mors than four times the capacity there was in
1920.
In 1972, when Congress last rejected Chairman

52

Oseka's request for this very authority, capacity of steam
plants had groiw by 35 times what it was in 1920.

Everybody

knows they use cooling water.
Now, the cooling water that is used from the sea,
it was referred here, obviously wouldn’t be —■ put the plant
within the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission.
If it was used from wells you don't get under the
authority of the Federal Water Power Act and consequently
the fact that the cooling water is taken here from the
navigable streams, it is a farfetched detour to say that
this tiny use of cooling water somehow four miles — by a
plant four miles from the stream somehow brings that by the
intent of Congress into the scope of an act intended to
regulate water power as this — both the majority and the
minority pointed out in the Tom Saw case, you are dealing
with the Federal Power Act with the hydroelectric potential
in falling water and the teaching of the Tom Saw case is it
makes no difference whether the water comes to the head of
the pen stocks by nature or by act of man through a pump.
It Is the falling water.
QUESTION:

Is this case the same as the Union

Electric case?
MR. ELY:
QUESTION:
MR. ELY:

Yes, yes, Union Electric.
Union Electric case.
We think, your Honor, that that case

53
controls this.

You cannot reach a contrary conclusion here

on the licensing of steam plants without abandoning the
rationale of the majority opinion written by Mr. Justice
White nor the minority opinion of Mr. Justice Goldberg in
which Mr. Justice Stewart joined.
There is a logical difference between the two.
Congress legislated in one field but not the other and the
arguments made here might very appropriately be made to
Congress.

Opinion might well differ and many parties should

be heard there who are not here in this Court.
One final point.
The point was made that in 1968, Congress, in
enacting the Colorado River Project Act, placed an embargo
upon the licensing of projects between the Glen Canyon Dam
and Hoover

Dam.
So

it did, but these were hydroelectric projects.

The projects at Bridge Canyon or Marble Canyon that had been
intended to provide power for the central Arizona project
and cash registers to help finance it and that the Sierra
Club and other conservationists opposed and said, no, use
thermal power for this pumping.
Whereupon, Congress put into the 1968 Act authority
for the Secretary to buy an interest in the plant attacked
here, the Navajo plant on Lake Paul and the United States
has appropriated some $200 million to buy a 24 percent

54
interest in that plant to pump water into the Central
Arizona Acqueduct.
That is one of the plants that

our opponents now

say would have to be licensed, not withstanding this Act of
Congress.
As to the Pour Corners plant, it is below the
Navajo dam on the San Juan.

An Act of Congress in 1962

said not only that you must have a contract to take water
from that dam, but if yours is a long-term contract, it must
be validated by special act of Congress.
Consequently, one plant below the Navajo dam
does have such a contract.

It was validated.

If the Pour

Corners plant is found, indeed, to be using water out of
that stream Instead of under state law appropriations, it
must get a contract which must go to Congress for approval
and the Federal Power Commission can’t grant it by a surplus
water license.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr. Ely.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:10 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
