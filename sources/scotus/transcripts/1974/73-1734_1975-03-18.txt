PRECEDING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-173*1* Gurley against Rhoden.
Counsel, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES R. DAVIS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
My name is Charles Davis of Jackson, Mississippi,
along with Mr. Waiter Armstrong, Mr. Hubert McBride of
Mempnis and Mr. Tom Tai'dy, also of Jackson, I represent the
Petitioner In this case, W. M'. Gurley, doing business as
Gurley Oil Company.
This action was brought by Mr. Gurley for the
recovery or refund of sales taxes imposed by the State of
Mississippi.
The Trial Court and the Supreme Court of
Mississippi denied Mr. GurleyJs claim.

This Court granted

certiorari on November 18, 1974.
The issue on this appeal and in the proceedings
below was stipulated by the parties and that is contained
at page 36 of the tan Appendix and that issue Is, whether or
no., federaa. and state gasoline excise taxes are properly or
legally includable in gross proceeds of sale or in the sales
price of gasoline under the Mississippi sales Tax Act.

Now, Mr. Gurley's contention is that he collects
these two excise taxes, that is, federal excise tax on
gasoline and the state excise tax on gasoline and that he
makes this collection as the agent of the United States and
of the State of Mississippi,
QUESTION:

If I get your- argument correctly in

your briefs, Mr. Davis, you are saying the state has no more
right to tax him for being this conduit than they could tax
an internal revenue agent who collects the money and passes
it on, the collector in Mississippi.
Is that about it?
MR. DAVIS:

That is correct,'Mr. Chief Justice.

We are saying that he merely acts as an agent
because of the point in the process of distribution that he
happens to fall.
He is the closest to the consumer of the gasoline
and logically and practically,' the tax scheme of both statute
imposes this duty of collection, reporting and payment to the
tax authorities on him.
QUESTION:

There is something of a difference,

though, in your case insofar as it turns on a federal statute
and in that part of your case where it turns on two state
statutes.
I take it in the latter case, the Supreme Court
Mississippi is free to decide who the tax is imposed on

5
and what role the tax collector has and the way that It
Isn't inhere you have got a federal statute.
MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Justice, it is our contention

that this Court, under the circumstances of this case, may
disregard the characterization of the Mississippi excise
tax by the Supreme Court of Mississippi and

the designation

of the tax as a privilege tax by the legislature.
QUESTION:

And —•

What authority would we have for

doing that?
MR. DAVIS:

Well, we have cited authorities in

our brief which we believe indicate that where constitu­
tional questions are presented such as we have here, where
if Mr. Gurley is taxed, a sales tax by the State of
Mississippi Is imposed upon Mississippi gasoline excise
taxes in his hands, that that Is to take his property with­
out due process of law and therefore we submit' that this
Court may look to the operation and effect of the Mississippi
statute and determine that, despite the ruling by the
Mississippi Supreme Court, tha.t it is a tax on the consumer
of gasoline.
QUESTION:

But that construction is the

construction by the highest court of the state, Is it not,
of a state statute?
MR. DAVIS:

That is correct.

Now, this Court,

in several cases, which we have cited in our brief, has

6
disregarded state court characterizations in similar
statutes involving gasoline excise taxes and we submit that
under the circumstances here, that you may do so.
Of course, there is no contention, as you point
out, Mr. Justice, that this Court does not have authority to
determine the incidence of the federal excise tax on
gasoline.
QUESTION:

You are — in this point that we have

been discussing, you are relying on that part of your brief
that begins on — point VI beginning on page '14 of your reply
brief, are you not?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, your Honor.
That portion of your reply brief.
And the cases cited there.
And the cases there cited.
So, we are asking this Court to

determine 'the incidence of these three gasoline excise taxes
and, secondly, we are saying that the Court may — in the
case of Mr. Gurley, who is actually a retailer of gasoline,
that it may determine that even though the incidence is on
the seller, that if the taxes accrue at the time of sale,
that it is impossible for these taxes to be included in
gross proceeds or as a part of the sales price and, there­
fore, the State ol Mississippi cannot impose a sales tax on
it at that juncture.

7
The sales tax accruing at that time, simultane­
ously on the retail sale

of the gasoline.

I would like to briefly state to the Court a
little bit about Mr. Gurley's operation.

The amount of the

taxes here was actually stipulated and a summary of that is
found at page 36 of the tan Appendix.
Mr. Gurley protested vigorously the payment of
these taxes.

He refused to pay the taxes and additional

assessments were rendered by the State of Mississippi. at
which time he did pay them but throughout the period
involved in the case at bar, he bore himself the burden of
all these taxes that he seeks the refund for.
/

Mr. Gurley is a small, Independent gasoline
operator.

He is located in West Memphis, Arkansas and he

has a number of retail outlets in the northern portion of
the State of Mississippi.
He purchases his product there in the Memphis
area and transports it by his trucks to the retail outlets
where the product is sold directly to the ultimate retail
consumer of the gasoline to be used on the highways.
QUESTION:

Does he have any connection with

Phillips?
MR. DAVIS:

Not that I am aware of, your Honor.

That, however, is a similar operation in the State of
Mississippi.

8
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Right.
So there is no middleman or wholesaler

or distributor Involved here In the case of Mr. Gurley.
Mow, the Mississippi Sales Tax Act Imposes a
five percent tax on the gross proceeds of any retail sale of
tangible personal property.
'Now, this sales tax is computed by Mr. Gurley and
we have summarized that computation at page 12 of our grey —
Petitioner’s main brief.
As I indicated, he purchases the product over
around Memphis for approximately — well, at the time of
the trial ■—
QUESTION:

These prices are a little out of date

n ow, aren’t they?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Justice, absolutely correct —
These figures.
— but at that time, back in 1971,

he bought the gasoline at about 1;4 cents per gallon and pushed
his mark-up to a retail price of the actual gasoline of 20
cents per gallon and at that point, Mr. Gurley imposed the
5 percent Mississippi sales tax on the 20 cents.
Mow, he separately — he contends — collects the
federal excise tax on gasoline and the state excise tax on
gasoline and during all of this period, he did not impose
or pass on any five percent sales tax on the two excise taxes.

9
QUESTION:

When does Mr. Gurley pay the federal

tax?
MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Gurley pays the federal tax —-

he actually makes remittances to federal depositories in
much the same manner as social security and withholding
remittances are made on — first, within three days after
the first and 15th of each month.
However, he files a quarterly return which
actually determines the final amount of his payment and we
submit that
QUESTION:

There is no issue here about that one

cent sales tax, is there?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

No.

That is right, your Honor.

That is not in this case at all.
That

is not in issue.

We are

attempting to get a refund of additional sales taxes above
that one cent.
QUESTION:

But the general one cent sales tax is

not here in issue at all.
MR. DAVIS:

That is correct.

I wish to point out that Mississippi is one of
the fevr states that actually Imposes a sales tax on
gasoline at all.
In addition —* right.
MR. DAVIS:

On any part of the price of gasoline.

10
QUESTION:

In Mississippi is the sales tax

required to be passed on to the buyer and stated separately?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honors it is.
But how about -- but there is no

requirement that an excise tax, federal excise tax be passed
onto anybody.
MR. DAVIS:
ment, that is correct.

There is no express statutory require­
But we submit

that a view of the

entire operation and effect of both statutes compels the
conclusion that these taxes be collected from the ultimate
consumer on the actual number of gallons ~
QUESTION;
once?

Is the federal excise tax paid only

How about a sale to Mr. Gurley?
MR. DAVIS:

It is only

paid once, your Honor.

It is — the statute provides in 26 USC 4083 that the sale
to a bonded producer is a tax-free sale so that the tax is
only collected at the point closest to the ultimate retail
sale of the gasoline.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

So you mean to Mr. Gurley.
In Mr. Gurley's case, there is only

one case where it can be collected because he buys it from
the manufacturer or supplier and makes the direct sale to
the ultimate consumer.

Now, another —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
after lunch.

We'll resume there

11
MR. DAVIS:

Thank you, your Honor.

[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o’clock noon to 1:01 o’clock p.m.'J
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Davis, you may

continue.
QUESTION:

Mr. DAvls, just before lunch you were

asked, I believe, by Justice White whether the Mississippi
sales tax or the federal gas tax had provisions for passing
on or for separate statement.
Let me ask you the same question about the
Mississippi gasoline tax.

Is there any provision in the

statute which imposes that tax that

either requires it being

passed on or prohibits it being passed on or requires it to
be separately stated?
MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, at the time of — at the

time period of the case at bar, from 1968 through sometime
in 1971, for approximately three-fourths of that time, there
was a provision in the Mississippi gasoline excise tax
statutes that provided that the seller could pass on to the
ultimate consumer the amount of the Mississippi gasoline
excise tax.
The Mississippi legislature repealed that provi­
sion in 1970 but for most of the period of time in question,
v/e did have that provision.

12
QUESTION:
ME. DAVIS:

What was the effect of repeal?
It simply repealed, your Honor, the

provision allowing or expressly allowing the passing on of
the tax and we submit that in practice there has been no
change in the operation and effect of the statute.
QUESTION:

You mean, Gurley still charges the

same price after the repeal as he did before?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Ybs, sir.
The price that included the tax.
That is correct.
Well, before, did he have a sign which

indicated that the tax was being charged to consumers
separately from the rest of the price?
MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, there is some evidence

in the record to the effect that decals were posted at most
of the retail locations. ' There is no statutory requirement
to that ‘effect but this was done by Mr. Gurley*
QUESTION:

This was done now before the repealor.
:• ;

MR. DAVIS:

Yes, sir.

i

QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

And after the repealor, what then?
The same practice applies.
So that th© decal actually says what?

"Added to the price is —whatever that’number of cents is.
MR. DAVIS:

Seven cents per gallon at that time.

It Is now nine cents per gallon.

13
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

But that Is what appeared,
Yes.
And included In the price is seven

cents per gallon, now nine cents per gallon, representing
the Mississippi franchise tax.
MR. DAVIS:

Is that it?

Or excise tax.

Excise tax on gasoline and four cents

per gallon for the federal excise tax on gasoline.
QUESTION:

Mr. Davis, Mr. Gurley is a retailer,

isn’t he?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
How does he come within the terms of

26 USC 4Q8l on page 3 of your brief?
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, your Honor.

A later section

of 26 USC provides a definition of the term producer under
the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

That Is 4082.
Yes.
And how does the

retailer fit ’within

that definition?
MR. DAVIS:

I believe that it provides that any

purchaser of gasoline tax-free is considered to be a producer
under the federal statute.
QUESTION:

Oh, and so Gurley didn't pay the

wholesaler or the producer any tax.
MR. DAVIS:

That Is correct.

That purchase waa

14
tax-free and the tax does not come into play In the case of
Gurley, particularly, until the time of the retail sale to
the ultimate consumer.
QUESTION:

Is that the way the oil business i3

normally conducted or Is this unusual?
MR. DAVIS:

Well, It is certainly not unusual In

the case of those operators similarly situated to Mr. Gurley
and the scheme of the statute Is that the tax be collected
at the source closest to the ultimate retail sale.
QUESTION:

How do you derive that from this

language?
MR, DAVIS:

The language does not expressly state

that but suppose there Were a series of sales to various
wholesalers or producers in a chain of distribution?
Those sales are tax-free because a sale to another
producer under the statute does not give rise to the tax
liability.
It only arises at the end of the chain of
distribution or at the point closest to the ultimate retail
sale.
QUESTION:

If Gurley had bought from a wholesaler,

would the wholesaler have been obligated to pay any tax?
MR. DAVIS:

No, your Honor, because of the fact

that Mr. Gurley Is a producer under the statute and is
properly qualified.

That would be a tax-free transaction.

15
QUESTION1:

Suppose he just owned the one filling

station and were a retailer and nothing else, if he bought
from a wholesaler, who would pay the tax?
T4R. DAVIS:

If he was qualified under the federal

statute and it is possible, I think, for him to be so
qualified, then he ’would pay it but if he were not, then
the tax would be remitted by the wholesaler.
Now, we cite in our brief a reference to the
revenue ruling which indicates that it is the intent of
the statute to impose the tax at tho latest point of
distribution and that the liability of the producer that is
responsible for emitting and reporting does not accrue until
there has been an ultimate retail sale.
QUESTION:

Was that partially — is that partly

because tht would be one way to separate tax resales from
other sales?
Mii. DAVIS:

I am not sure I understand your

question.
QUESTION;

Certain purchasers of gasoline

purchase tax-free, do they not?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Depending on the use.

Now is this

statute geared to that proposition?
If it were taxed

back at an earlier point, you’d

have no way of — at least, it would be very difficult to

separate them* would it not’?
Mr*. DAVIS:

Well, I think perhaps that is one

QUESTION;
argument.

Umri hmn.

Well, go on with your

I just wanted to locate that point.
MR. DAVIS:

So we submit, if it please the

Court, that the resolution of this basic issue of the
validity of the inclusion of state and federal gasoline
excise taxes in the sales tax base is to be determined by
this Court looking at the actual effect and operation of the
two gasoline excise tax statutes.
The purpose of both of these statutes is un­
questionably to raise funds to finance and construct highways
on the state and federal level.
The intent of Congress is obviously to impose that
tax upon the persons who use these highways and to measure
the tax in proportion to the use of the highways by the
ultimate consumer of the gasoline.
And the operation and effect of the statutes is
c learly one that measures the tax on that sale of each gallon
that goes into the car on the highway.

17
Thera is no tax ever paid for non-highway use of
any sort.

If it is used for fanning purposes or local

transit systems or if it is spilled out on the ground or if
it is destroyed in a fire —
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Or for lawnmowers.
Or for lawnmowers or whatever, unless

.and the state gasoline excise taxes in question.
QUESTION:

How about the federal tax?

Does it

Or does it exempt only farm,

agricultural use?
MR. DAVIS:

yes, it does, your Honor.

have the same broad exemption for nonhighway use.

They both
'They

break it down into different categories of refunds but
basically it has that exemption of nonhighway use.
QUESTION:

Well, where do you go from here?

Suppose it Is on the consumer?
MR. DAVIS:
White.

It is on the consumer, Mr. Justice

We submit that it is impossible for the Mississippi

sales tax to be imposed on that portion of the price that
Mr. Gurley collects from the consumer.
This is not a part of his price.

It is not a

part of his gross proceeds of the retail sale.
QUESTION:

Well, it is part of the money and part

18
of the price he takes from the consumer in the sense that
he collects that money from him.

MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

It is.

And if he didn't collect it from him,

he would have to pay it anyway.

MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

That is right.
So he does collect It from the

consumer for a reason and that is to keep it from coming out
of his own pocket.

a'

Now, why can't the state put a sales tax on that
part of It?

Because of immunity or what?
MR. DAVIS:

Well, that is one reason.

In the

case of the federal tax, this is money that he holds in his
hands that belongs to the United States

Government and to

tax that would be to tax the Federal Government.
In the case of the state tax, again, it is
monies that belongs to the state government and to tax those
state taxes would be to take hurley’s property without due
process of law.
And we submit that this is an unconstitutional
exercise of the taxing power of the State of Mississippi, to
make those Impositions
QUESTION:

of a sales tax.
I suppose in both these cases, once

the — if this case were decided against you, Gurley would
never suffer any loss In the future.

19
He would Just collect whatever it was,
tax load, from the consumer.

the total

What he would lose is, maybe,

if you go by supply and demands you might say, I'd sell
less gasoline.

Because the price —

MR. DAVIS:

Well, that is correct.

That aspect

of it is very real in the State of Mississippi where all of
the bordering states, because of this sales tax, have a
price of three or four cents per gallon less than we do in
Mississippi.
QUESTION:

Now, on the federal statutes relating

to withholding taxes — and I suspect cn social security
t axe3 — there are some special sanctions for failing to
deliver them.

That is, they are constituted a trust fund,

are they not?
MR. DAVTS:

Yes, your Honor, and that i3 true

in the case of —~
QUESTION:

Do you have a parallel?

An exact

parallel here?
MR. DAVIS:
nearly

I would think that it would be very

exact.

f

QUESTION:

Well, you have an exact parallel in

terms of sanctions for not paying it other than just the
normal penalties for not paying the tax.
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
What are they?

20
ME. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

Well, there are criminal penalties.
That is what I am talking about.

Explain that a little, will you?

What is before

you.
MR. DAVIS:

The federal statute and the state

statute both provide that it is the absolute liability of
the seller to collect and report this money.
QUESTION:

I think in both cases they are a trust

fund concept.
MR. DAVIS:
your
to

We submit that that is the case,

Honor and that on failure to do so, he is liable for —
criminal penalties in the statutes.
QUESTION:

It is five percent cn 11 cents.

That

is about a half-cent a gallon, isn't it?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

Yes.
How much money are we talking about?
In this case we are talking about

approximately -$100,000 over a period of about six years and
as indicated in our brief, we have filed for a later period
that involves about — [inaudible]
QUESTION:

So that is about eight, nine cents.

It used to be eight and now it Is nine cents.
MR. DAVIS:

It was originally seven and now It Is

nine.
QUESTION!

Mr. Davis, was the constitutional

Issue raised before the Supreme Court of Mississippi?
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, your Honor, it was.

We did not

brief it and discuss it as thoroughly as we have In this
Court.
QUESTION:

It wasn’t addressed by the Mississippi

Supreme Court, was it?
MR. DAVIS:
QUESTION:

No, it was not.
And was it raised in the complaint?

Relied upon?
MR. DAVIS:

I believe that it was pleaded and

if you read the context of the factual allegations and the
quotation of our statutes in their, I think it Is inescapable
that the constitutional issue is there, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Mr. DAvis, do I oversimplify in

describing your argument as one that this, in effect, is a
tax on a tax?
MR. DAVIS:
the concept

Well, your Honor, we do not condemn

of a tax on a tax as such.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVTS:

You think that is all right?
But in this case, we think it is not

all right for the reasons that we stated.
QUESTION:
MR. DAVIS:

When would it ever b© all right?
Well, In almost every retail sale of

any product, you have built into the price taxes that
accrued back up the line.

22

QUESTION:

Directly?

MR. DAVIS:

Well, we are submitting that that is

the difference.
Here, the time of accrual here Is different.
QUESTION:

But on the state tax it seems to me

that there is nothing

if the state wants to tax Its own

property, there is nothing wrong with that like there is the
state trying to tax what you say is federal property.
MR. DAVIS:

Your Honor, I think it is, because

on the state tax, they would be extracting from Mr. Gurley.
QUESTION:

Well, not in the future.

He could just

add it on to the price.
MR. DAVIS:

Well, but at the time of the collection,

they would'be extracting a sales tax.
QUESTION:

They are not extracting it.

He is

charging the buyer for it.
MR. DAVIS:

That is true.

QUESTION:

Like he has to.

MR. DAVIS:

He does pass it on.

But he makes the payment —
i

QUESTION:

I know,but as long as he passes it on,

it doesn't come out of his pocket.
And you have another ground on the federal side
that you just can’t tax the Federal Government.
MR. DAVIS:

That's right.

23
QUESTION:

Would you say that the State of

Mississippi couldn’t measure its sales tax on the gross
business done by a retailer, even though some of the
retailer’s sales were on a credit basis and the people —
the purchasers defaulted?
MR. DAVIS:

I am not sure I understand your

question, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing you have a two percent

sales tax on a druggist and it is on the gross business he
does and his gross business is $2 million during a particular
tax period but In fact $100,000 of those sales were for
credit.

He never got the cash and a certain number of those

default so they are bad debts.
Would you say that the state had to constitu­
tionally recognize an allowance for a bad debt there?
MR. DAVIS:

There is the liability here in our

case for collection and payment, clearly, by the seller.
If he does not make that collection, he is liable
for the payment.

But we submit that that situation must be

distinguished from the actual legal incidence of the tax and
that it is no more than a case of an agent having the duty
to make this selection.
We have not covered the point of credit sale In
our discussion of this case.

Normally, of course, the retail

sale of gasoline is not done on a credit basis.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. DAVIS:

Very well, Mr. Davis.

Thank you, your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gholson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUNTER M. GHOLSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GHOLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At the outset of the argument for the Respondent,
I want to confess and apologize for two factual errors which
appear in the Respondent's brief.
I do not think that either of them go to the
merits of the argument, but I do apologize for them.
Although the Mississippi Supreme Court very
clearly

based its decision which is here under consideration

on a treatment of the Panhandle Oil Company case decided by
this Court, with respect to its dealing with Mississippi
gasoline excise taxes a3 they existed at the time of that
decision, we have incorrectly categorized those taxes as sales
taxes in cur brief.
They were excise taxes, as Mr. Davis points out
In his brief.
QUESTION:

specific
Are there any/corrections you want us

to make on particular pages?

or are you just calling this

to our attention?
MR. GHOLSON:

I just want to apologize for having

25
referred to that as a sale3 tax.
QUESTION:

Very well.

MR. GHOLSON:

All right.

With respect to our argument on the

fact that the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court is
not subject to review by federal courts with respect to the
incidence of the Mississippi tax which is in point IV of
our brief, we have cited two cases and quoted from one of
them.
We cite Society for Savings versus Bowers and
Agricultural National Bank versus State Tax Commission.
We have attributed the quotation to the Bowers
case that actually comes from

Agricultural National

Bank case at the point xvhere Bowers Is cited.
And Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, you have
been furnished with a copy of the first brief before it
was reprinted and it is not in the proper form.

This brief

has been reprinted and I believe the other Justices have —
QUESTION:

This Is properly printed.

MR. GHOLSON:

Yes, sir, it is properly printed.

The other one was not.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. GHOLSON:

With respect to the constitutional

arSument that has been made here, I can find3 in answer to
Mr. Justice Powell’s question — I can find no reference in
the original complaint to the Constitution of the United

26
States.
The statutes are cited and it is alleged in the
complaint that Mr. Gurley is entitled to a refund by reason
of those statutes.
I believe it would be fair to argue on behalf of
the Respondent that for this Court to determine tha t

the

Mississippi case must be reversed would require this Court
to rule that the Mississippi sales tax laws are unconstitu­
tional or violative of the United States Constitution.
Section 27.65 (3) of the Mississippi Code of 1972
provides that gross proceeds of sale shall include, among
other things, all taxes except those which are specifically
exempt by a subsequent section.

\

The brief for the Petitioner on page 15 makes
reference to this problem.

The federal diesel fuel tax is

specifically exempt because it is a part of Chapter 32 of
26 Unite,d States Code — a part of Chapter 31 which is
entitled "Retailers’ Excise Taxes" and the diesel tax is a
part of that.

The diesel taxes are exempt.

On the contrary, the gasoline excise tax of the
United States is not included in that chapter, but is in
Chapter 32, entitled "Manufacturers’ Excise Taxes" and it is
for that reason that under the sales tax statute of
Mississippi, Mr. Gurley is not entitled to deduct the
federal gasoline excise tax as he is not entitled to deduct

27
the Mississippi gasoline excise tax.
QUESTION:

Can we get back a moments Mr. Gholson,

to the suggestion that

the complaint did not allege any

federal constitutional defects?
MR. GHOLSON: I believe that Is correct,
Mr. Justice Brennan,
QUESTION: Then may I ask you a question?

What

did, as regards your state tax, the Mississippi Supreme
Court address and decide that federal constitutional claim
in respect to that tax?
MR. GHOLSON:

The Mississippi Supreme Court

decided that under their understanding of the prevailing
rules of this Court, that the federal excise tax is legally
an incident placed upon the wholesaler, Mr. Gurley and not
upon the consumer and for that reason, is not — is a part
of the gross sales price.
QUESTION:

So that federal question, clearly

MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

— your court decided.

MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Now, how about the attack upon the

u.nclusj.oh ox the state franchise tax, the seven cents?
MR. GHOLSON:

The state franchise tax has been

determined by the State Supreme Court to be illegally upon
the wholesaler because it is Imposed at the moment that the
tax is brought Into the state and I think this gets us —

28
QUESTION:

But what I am trying to get to Is,

in sustaining it, did they sustain It against the claim that
it violated the federal Constitution?
MR. GHOLSON:

I find nothing In the complaint that

alleges that.
QUESTION:

No, in the opinion.

MR. GHOLSON:

No, sir, no, sir, I do not believe

they addressed themselves to that question.
QUESTION:

But your court felt that it must

decide the federal question as to where the federal excise
tax has its burden or Its incidence?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And you agree \*ith that.

I mean, you

do agree with the way they decided that?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Sc that the federal — you are not

suggesting that this Court has no jurisdiction here because
the federal question wasn’t decided by the highest court of
your state?
MR. GHOLSON:

No, sir, we are not arguing that at

all.
I simply —• I recognize that this Court has the
duty to review the decision —
QUESTION:

Suppose we disagreed with the

Mississippi Supreme Court that the incidence of the federal

29
tax is on the consumer?
MR. GHOLSON:

Then I think it would be the duty

of this Court to reverse as to the federal tax but I do not
think it would be —
QUESTION:

What if we just said, we reverse, the

tax is on the consumer and we reversed?

What would the

Supreme Court of Mississippi do then under its tax laws?
Because this isn't a constitutional question.
This question we are just talking about.

It

isn't a constitutional question, it is just an interpretation of the federal statute erroneously end if we decided
against you and so,what would the Mississippi court do if
that is all we said?
MR. GHOLSON:

I believe that is a sort/ of two­

pronged question, Mr. Justice White.
First, the sales tax statute of Mississippi, by
its term, includes the federal excise tax In the base for
sale —
QUESTION:

No matter what.

MR. GHOLSON:

No matter whether it is an incident

placed on the consumer or the,wholesaler.
QUESTION:

Well, why, then, did the Mississippi

Supreme Court go to such great pains to look at where the
incidence of the federal tax was?
MR. GHOLSON:

They decided it on the theory that

30

the Incidence of the federal tax was on the wholesaler.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it is Irrelevant under your

statute, you are suggesting.
MR. GHOLSON:

I am suggesting that one can make a

strong argument to the fact that in order to reverse as to
the federal tax, this Court would have to declare that sales
tax provision unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Well, you just told me no.

You just

said no, that If we disagreed with you as to the Incidence
of federal tax, we should reverse.
MR. GHOLSON :

Then I would like to change my

answer to your question because unless you find that the
sales tax provision as Interpreted by the Supreme Court of
Mississippi is unconstitutional federally, then it would be
Irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Well, I suggest that you are suggesting

that your court went through a wholly

unnecessary useless

procedure and — in deciding where the incidence of federal
tax was.

And I suggest they felt it was essential to

decide it,
MR, GHOLSON:
first statement.

I would never be quoted as making the

I think that they could have decided it as

they decided it or on the second theory which we discussed.
QUESTION:

What about the language of 27.55(11)?

Maybe you have gone over that, but it went over my head if

31
you did.
The language is, "Shall- pay for the privilege of
engaging in such business,"a tax

equal to eight cents a

gallon.
Is that just the new statute?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

That Is the new statute.

NOW, is that the same language?

MR. GHOLSON:

But it Is not different from the

language — the material language, Mr. Chief Justice, has
existed since 1928, when Mississippi amended its statute
in response to the Panhandle decision.
QUESTION:

Well, to itfhat extent did the Supreme

Court of Mississippi rely on that language that it is a tax
on the privilege of doing business rather than a tax on
the consumer per gallon?
MR. GHOLSON:

That is the Gravelman Mississippi

opinion.
QUESTION:

Well, then, that is why I got lost on

some of the colloquy.

I thought that this statute was an

explicit effort to separate this from the normal tax which
Is placed on the consumer, a sales tax on a commodity, and
here it is a tax on the privilege.
MR. GHOLSON:

We are speaking now of the

Mississippi excise tax?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Right.

32
MR. GHGLSON:

And it clearly is that.

It attaches

when the commodity comes into the state and payment must be
remitted by the 20th of the

following month3 irrespective of

any date of sale or incident of sale.
Now, with respect to Mr. Justice White's questions,
I had understood they referred to the federal excise tax and
its inclusion in the sales tax has?- by virtue of this
Mississippi decision which was made on the basis of the fact
that as a matter of federal law that is an incident, a legal
incident placed upon the wholesaler and not upon tho
consumer.
I think that It is rather central to the issue here
to get down to something that was asked by Mr. Justice Powell
and that is, whether Mr. Gurley is a wholesaler or a retailer,
I think he is, in fact, both because under the
definition of producer or distributor, he is that and becomes
liable for the tax when he brings it into Mississippi.
The fact that he chooses to sell it directly to
the ultimate consumer does not prevent hir,\ from being under
\

the language of the statute, a producer or distributor.
The effect of Mr. Gurley's position being sustained
would be that all those retailers who purchase from wholesalers Would have to include the excise tax in the sales tax
base but Mr. Gurley would be excused from including it and
therefore, we would argue that if there are any federal

33
constitutional issues here, they mitigate in favor of the
system that the Respondent has urged and that the Mississippi
court has adopted.
QUESTION:

Mr. Davis, I thought, said — on the

question of where this tax fell, that it was limited to tax
on gasoline used on the highway.
Do you agree with that?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

No, sir, I do not.

The statute seems to be pretty clear

in saying, "For sale or — for sale, usevon the highways,
storage, distribution or for any other purpose."
Now, does that mean lawnmower gasoline is subject
to the tax?
MR. GHOLSON:

Any provision for relief to people

who bear the economic burden of this tax and who are not
highway users come from other statutes, other sections
giving rights of credit or refund.
I do not believe —
\

QUESTION:

The farmer who uses it on his tractor

can keep a record and go and get a refund?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And I suppose, then, the lawnmower

fellow, if it was worth his trouble, could do the same, under
your statute?

Is that right?

MR.' GHOLSON:

That is my understanding.

The

Illinois court, in its decision in the Martin ca3es very
similar to this case under consideration, addressed Itself to
that point and said that these are not technically refund
statutes.

They are really credits given to people who bear

an economic burden contrary to the intention of the statute.
Mr. Davis has argued that it is the intention of
the Congress to tax the users of the highways to pay for
highways by such taxes.
I think it could be as logically argued that it
is the intention of the excise statutes to tax the people
who engage in the business of selling gasoline for use on
such highways.

Certainly, the language of the statute itself

as pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice, says that it is a
privilege tax placed upon doing that business.
I would like to mention that with respect to
state court interpretations of the legal incidence of the
United States excise tax, PennsyIvania, Michigan, North
Dakota and lower courts of New

York have taken the view that

that federal tax is o consumer or user tax.
Illinois, New Jersey, Indiana, Alabama and Georgia
as well as Mississippi have taken the vievr which we espouse
her-e „
Now, In the reply brief for the Respondent, a
considerable attack is made upon the citation of the Ferrara
case from Nei? Jersey saying that that is only a Tax

35
Commission case.
That case has since been affirmed by the New
Jersey Superior Court and reported and a certification has
been denied by the New Jersey Supreme Court.
That brings us to the point where the highest
court of New Jersey has acted on that case and I have those
citations, if it would be proper to give them.
The 127 New Jersey Supreme Court, 240.317
Atlantic 2nd 80 is the opinion.

The subsequent denial of

certification is without opinion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gholson, could I make sure, did

the State Supreme Court construe the state excise tax on
gasoline to be a tax on the seller?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

That is correcti

Now,that is a 3tate law question,

isn't it?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Now, assuming that is correct, do

you understand there to be any challenge then to the
collection of a sales tax on the total sales price including
the tax?
MR. GHOLSON:

I understand that the Petitioner

here is challenging the validity of that determination by
the Missislppi Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but that is just a state

36
law question.
MR. GHOLSON:

That is our position entirely,

Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

And if he gets to his constitutional

question — only if the tax is on the consumer.

If you

construed the excise tax to be on the consumer.
MR. GHOLSON:

We believe that the earlier

precedents of this Court would say that the state’s
determination of that state statute as to Its legal
incidence is final.
QUESTION:

Different from the federal question.

MR. GHOLSON:

Yes, sir.

I think that if this case is — if this Court
affirms the position of the Mississippi Supreme Court as to
the federal statute, then there would be no question about
the state statute.
It could affirm as to the state statute but not
as to the federal.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the federal question

involving the Imposition of the sales tax oh the state
franchise tax?
MR. GHOLSON:

I do not believe there is a federal

question on the imposition of the state tax.
QUESTION:

Then, is this to suggest that at least

as to the sales tax as imposed on the state franchise tax of

seven cents, we have no jurisdiction?
MR. GHOLSON:

It is our position that this Court

is bound by Its earlier precedents to honor the state
determination

of the state tax.

QUESTION:

But you do agree that the Imposition
the
of sales tax on the federal excise tax,/four cents, is here?
MR. GHOLSON:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And that because of the conflict among the states
interpreting the legal incidence of the federal tax, that'
this Court must determine that question,,
I would like to point out some distinction in
our situation and that of the trustee theory of tax
collection advanced by the Petitioner, page 36 of his brief.
The Petitioner cites the number of cases in which the
merchant or some other person has been held to be a trustee
for the Federal Government in the collection of certain
federal taxes.
In the principal case cited in the body

of the

brief, Paisner versus 0!Connell, the jewelry excise tax, as
I understand the statute, was placed upon the retail sale
to the customer and that made the jeweler a collector or
trustee.
Likewise, the toll bridge tax in the United
States versus Washington Toll Bridge cited in the footnote
was imposed on the person who was paying for the use of the

38
toll bridge by statute, again a trustee.
The United States versus First Capital National
Bank was' a tax imposed upon the price of admission to
collegiate athletic functions by the United States and, again,
as a trustee situation.
We submit that that is entirely distinct from
the instant case in which both the federal and state statutes
are imposed upon the producer or wholesaler.
We

would submit that there is nothing in the

cases which have been decided by this Court sines the Panhandle
Oil Company decision which give credence to the argument of
the Petitioner that this Court has determined that the
federal gasoline excise tax is placed upon the consumer.
In the King and Booser decision, which we think
specifically overrules in part the Panhandle decision, the
i:

opinion of the Court stated to the extent that this Court
had adopted a doctrine of economic burden as determining
legal incidence.

That doctrine was repealed.

In the subsequent case, Kern-Limerick, cited
the Petitioner, no modification of

by

King and Booser was done

by this Court, but there was simply a finding that as a matter
of fact, the United States Navy was the purchaser of tractors
and therefore was immune from.the placement of the Arkansas
sales uax, wnich was placed on the consumer.
We would submit that the language of the Illinois

39
court

in the Martin case, its rationale as adopted by the

Mississippi court in this case is persuasive of the fact that
the federal tax is not a tax placed upon the ultimate
consumer, that it is a tax placed upon the wholesaler.
The question was asked by Mr. Justice Stewart
as to v/hether or not the Mississippi sales tax is in issue
and I

understood counsel to say that the validity of

Mississippi sales tax i3 not in issue.
We would submit, again, that if the language of
the Mississippi sales tax law is accepted as constitutional
and valid, that that language itself includes both of these
excise taxes in the tax base from which the sales taxes
are computed.
The question has been asked several times as to
whether or not the Mississippi law requires that the excise
tax

be passe d

on to the consumer.

The answer to that question is, definitely no.
In the statute before its last amendment in 1970,
there was a provision that the tax could be passed along to
the consumer and that provision was eliminated.
There has never been a provision that the tax
must be passed along to the consumer and this question was
addressed by the Georgia Supreme Court in the Thoni Oil
cases in which the Georgia court held that the federal tax
was includable because it did not have to be passed on except

as an economic burden at the discretion or the payer of
the tax while, on the other hand, the Georgia statute was so
written that the Georgia tax would be passed on.
We believe that this is & valla distinction and
an additional basis under which the position of the
Mississippi and Illinois and New Jersey courts should be
sustained.
QUESTION:

What is the Mississippi situation now?

That the state tax cannot be passed on?
MR. GHOLSOM:

The authority to pass it on has been

eliminated fyom the statute.
QUESTION:

Expressly.

MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But what is the situation?

May it be

passed on or not?
MR. GHOLSON:

As an economic burden, as this

Court and others have said, all cost3 of doing; business are,
; £
in effect, passed on.
••

QUESTION:

And this, in practice, is passed on, is

it not?
MR. GHOLSON:
QUESTION:

As an economic burden, yes, sir.

Well, as a tax.

MR. GHOLSOM:

But the question that has bean asked

about whether or not the price specifically showed that the
tax was excluded, the price on the pump itselft did not.

It

41
included the excise taxes in the price.
QUESTION:

Without separate specification.

MR. GHOLSON:

That is correct.

But there were

decal3 which Mr. Gurley in his testimony alleged that he
had at his service station which showed the taxes broken
out.
QUESTION:

So much per gallon and so much state

tax and so much federal tax.
MR. GHOLSON:

Yes, sir.

If there are no further questions, this concludes
the argument for the Respondent.
