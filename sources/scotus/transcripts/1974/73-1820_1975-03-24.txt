proceedings
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1820, Philbrook against Glodgett, and 74-132,
Weinberger against Glodgett, consolidated cases*
Mr. Patton*, you may proceed whenever you’re ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L„ PATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT WEINBERGER
MR* PATTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These cases are here on direct appeal from the
judgment of a three-judge court in the District of Vermont*
The cases involve the relationship between the Aid
to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC, Unemployed
Father Program, and Unemployment Compensation benefits.
b) (2)
ii)
sic/

The principal statute involved is Section 607(c)
(2)(ii), which I shall refer to in argument as the mandatory
bar.

That provision appears on page 3 of our brief.
As this Court knows, the AFDC program is a program

of cooperative federalism, funded by a system of matching
State and federal grants.
The federal statute sets out certain conditions that
State plans must satisfy in order to receive federal funding.
And the mandatory bar provision provides that State plans must
provide for the denial of AFDC benefits with respect to any
week for which such child's father receives unemployment

4
compensation under an Unemployment Compensation law of a State
or the United States.
Now, the plaintiffs in this case were all families
which were eligible for AFDC benefits but for the fact that in
each case the unemployed father received unemployment compensa­
tion under State law.
And in each case the amount of unemployment compensa­
tion received was considerably less than the AFDC benefits for
which the family would have been eligible.
QUESTION s

Does the record show whether they are

still unemployed, Hr. Patton?
MR* PATTON:

Hr* Justice Blackmun, it does not show

the status of things as of this moment. We do know that Mr.
Sarazin, who is an intervenor, continues to be unemployed and
continues to receive unemployment compensation.
At the bottom of page 6 of our brief there is a table
which shows the differences in benefit levels, and I want to
call the Court’s attention to the fact that there is one error
in that table.

The Dsrosia family was eligible for #94 a

month in AFDC, and rather than $56 in unemployment compensation
that figure should be $224.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Sorry, what page is that?
Page S of our brief.

There is a table

at the bottom, which shows the difference in benefits.
QUESTION:

And would you male© the

tell us the

correction again?
MR. PATTON:

Instead of $56 in the righthand

column —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

— tliat should be $224,
Unh-hunh*

MR. PATTON:

That's the Derosia family.

Yes, sir.

Now, we can’t assume that this table is necessarily
representative, for a number of reasons,. First of all, of
course, AFDC benefits depend on a number of variables, the
extent

other resources available to the family and

primarily on the number of dependents.
Unemployment compensation is generally 50 percent
of the previous salary.
QUESTION:

In any event, it doesn't have anything

to dp with how large the family is or —
MR* PATTON:

rt does not.

Well, —

QUESTION: Does it?
MR, PATTON:

there may be some relation, Mr.

Justice Stewart, in that some State Unemployment Programs
have higher maximums depending on the number of dependents.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

I didn't know that.,
But to that — only to that limited

extent.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh

6

QUESTION:

Well, is it likely, in that case, Mr.

Patton, that the highest may be as high as the AFDC benefits
for the same family?
HR. PATTON:

Certainly in the case of lov7™income

people, it is not likely»
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. PATTON:

However, there is one additional factor

and that is that Vermont, like most States, has a general
assistant program.

And the record does not show the extent

of benefits that were received in this case, but we do know
that at l&aart- the Percy family received general assistance.
As I understand the Vermont general assistance program,
it is basically an itenv“by“*item need program.

If the family

finds that it can’t pay its rent, for example, it can apply for
general assistance for the amount of the rent,
QUESTION:
MR, PATTON:
on a Statewide basis„

Is this administered through the counties?
In Vermont, I believe it’s administered
But in many States it i3 administered

through counties,

MR, PATTON: And it’s wholly State funded,

QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
Mr, Patton, may I be

clear?

Of the

AFDC figures in this column on page 6, your position is what,
as respects how much of that they lose if the father receives

MR, PATTONs

They lose all of it, Mr. Justice

Brennan.
QUESTIONS

All Of it?

QUES TION:

Unh-hunh,

QUESTIONs

And I gather that what's happened here

is they waived their unemployment compensation, is that right?
And the question is whether the word "receives" in the
statute, section (ii) —
QUESTION:

That's what it comes down to as a matter

of statutory language.
QUESTION:

—• "for which such child's father receives

unemployment corapensation" means actual receipt?
MR. PATTON:

Yes, sir, that's the statutory

ques tion,
QUESTION:

And he waives it, then he doesn't

actually receive it?
MR. PATTON:
court

That's correct.

The district

originally the statute was challenged on constitu~

tional grounds.

The district court decided it could avoid

the question by holding that fathers have an option:

they

can turn down unemployment compensation.
Now, Mr, —
QUESTION:
question, isn't it?

But that's another way of putting the
That whether they have an option to take

MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That's — we believe that —

They pay —• the unemployment scheme is

something for which they pay, isn't it?
MR. PATTONs

Well, private employers make contribu-

tions to the unemployment compensation scheme.

I’m not sure

— I believe that employees do make contributions,
QUESTION:
MR, PATTON:

Oh, yasa
The district court construction, we

believe, is contrary to the legislative history and structure
of the Act and administrative construction, and those sources
will be discussed in more detail by Mr, Kalib for the State of
Vermont.
QUESTION t

In other vrords, you would — this is the

result of congressional carelessness, the statute?
MR. PATTON:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I’m not

sure — we do know that in I960- — perhaps if I just went into
briefly the history of the unemployed father program, we carsee how this provision came into the law.
Up until 1961, AFDC did not extend to families with

j
an unemployed father, and in that year it was so extended on an
experimental basis.
Now, at that time the law provided that States had
an option, they could deny AFDC if the father received unemploy­
ment compensation, or not.

Some States did deny.

I think

9

only three»

The other States supplemented.

Howf in '67 and '68, when the unemployed father
program was made permanent, the Senate wanted to continue that
optional system, but the House bill provided for the mandatory
bar.
The difficulty with giving fathers an option is
really threefold.
First of all, it makes the mandatory bar a nullity.
There would simply be no reason to have a provision requiring
a termination if it could be circumvented by an option.
And secondly, it operates on an assumption that
Congress wanted to encourage the unemployed to turn down
unemployment benefits.
And finally, in operation, it shifts significant
i

costs from the Unemployment Compensation Program that is
funded by private employers to AFDC, which is of course funded
by State and general revenues.
QUESTION;

Hr. Patton, —

MR. PATTON:

Yes, sir?

QUESTION;

the three-judge district court didn’t

decide this case on a constitutional basis, did it?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

It did not.
Are you sure that the appeal should come

here rather than to the Court of Appeals?
MR. PATTON:

Well, it did enter an injunction —

10

QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

But it didn’t —
It construed the statute and then

ordered the Secretary of HEW to approve the plan in accordance
with its decision.
Now, perhaps I — as I read Hagans v. Lavine, the
three-judge court was convened here because of the constitutional
challenge, and we don’t think it can be said that the constitu­
tional claim was fictitious or frivolous on the face of the
complaint.

And having jurisdiction, it could then consider

the statutory claim.
QUESTION:
the question is:

It certainly had jurisdiction, but then

Who has jurisdiction over the appeal, if it

decides it only on the statutory claim?
QUESTION: Right.

Suppose a single judge, when the

complaint had been filed, had said to counsel: Well, I'm
supposed to hear the •— the statutory issue is supposed to be
heard first, and that's just a single-judge issue.
required to be heard by a three-judge court.

It's not

Therefore, I'm

going to hear it.
And suppose he had done that and he had decided
against you?

Now, you would have gone to the Court of Appeals,

wouldn't you?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

I believe we would have, on that.
Well,

then, why can you come here now,

because it's not an issue that's required to be heard by a

11
three-judge court.
QUESTION:

Even if a three-judge court decided it.

MR. PATTONj

It’s not an issue that's required to be

heard by a three-judge court, but the three-judge court can
hear it if —
QUESTION: Well, but -- how does that make it
appealable here?

Merely because the three-judge court

hears it, if it’s not a constitutional issue,
QUESTION;

Don't you have to argue, in response to

Mr. Justice Brennan, that the supremacy clause determination
is a constitutional determination for purposes of our appellate
jurisdiction?
QUESTION;
MR. PATTON;

But we’ve rejected that.
Well, it may have been rejected, but

then in Hagans v. Lavine, I thought that it was again
reconsidered, though not adopted.
Now, at least -QUESTION;

I thought Hagans v„ Lavine looked just

the other direction»
QUESTION;
536 to 543?

Did you read all seven pages, from

They added, up to that?

MR„ PATTON:

No, no»

I don't suggest that Hacjans v,

Lavine resolves the question,
QUESTION:

Well, we've got to decide in this case,

don't we, whether you’re properly here?

12

MR, PATTON:

You do, Mr. Justice Brennan, and I —

if it
QUESTION:

And I gather the same applies, doesn't it,

to the State of Vermont's appeal in the other case?
QUESTION:
MR, PATTON:

It's no different, is it, in that respect?
Well, there is a jurisdictional question

with respect to the United STates, which is quite a bit
different from the one with respect to the State.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

Well, that's with respect to 1343.
That's right.
No, but I mean on this question of whether

this is a proper direct appeal.

I gather Vermont cams here

from the same judgment, didn't they?
MR. PATTON:
QUESTION:

They did.
Yes. And so whether that's a proper appeal

here is the same question in that case as it is in this one,
isn't it?
MR. PATTON:

It would be the same question, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Except that Vermont might be able to

rely on the supremacy clause as a constitutional basis, but
certainly the federal government in no event can rely on the
supremacy clause, since you're talking about the construction
of a federal statute.
MR. PATTON:

That's correct.

We're not concerned

13
with the conflict, the supremacy issue.
Now, assuming that

if we assume that there is

jurisdiction for the appeal, and frankly it’s something that,
if the Court is concerned, we'd like to submit a supplemental
brief on, and I think our opponent would concur in that.
QUESTIONS

You mean on this issue of the right to

appeal?
MR, PATTON:

On the issue of the appealability of

the order.
Now, assuming for the moment that the case is
properly here, and assuming that the Court agrees with our
construction of the statute, there then is a further question
concerning the constitutional challenge,

I don't know there’s

any doubt but that the Court can reach the constitutional
question in this case if it wishes to.

But it need not»

And we have suggested that it be remanded.

And one of the

reasons we’ve suggested that it be remanded is because the AFDC
program is so complex that we thought the Court might benefit
from the district court's decision of the issue in light of
correct instruction of the statute.
And it's also true that the record could be supple­
mented, particularly concerning

general assistance benefits.

But we do not contend that it's absolutely necessary to remand.
There is sufficient material in the record to consider the
constitutional question

14
And as to the constitutional claim, appellees * claim
is basically that the mandatory bar operates to exclude children
solely on the ground that their father receives unemployment
compensation, even though they may be in need.
And it does operate that way, but implicit in
appellees* claim is the assumption that the AFDC program is in
fact a comprehensive public assistance program, or that it is
constitutionally required to be, and we think either assumption
is correct.
Need is the primary goal of the AFDC program, but
Congress is operating within a framework of the limited amount
of funds.

And given that context, it has chosen to provide

assistance to those x-fho are least able to change their circum••
stances.
And fathers — unemployment compensation may be less
than AFDC benefits, but it may be supplemented by general
assistance.
States may be stimulated to upgrade their programs,
and there’s some indication that that is in fact occurring.
In addition, the unemployment compensation benefits
promote an attachment to the work force.

It*s a weekly benefit,

Vermont recipients are required to go down to the Public
Employment Office to get their checks and fill out certain
forms.
QUESTIONS

You suggest that some States are upgrading

15
their unemployment compensation benefits so that they in fact
reach nearly what the AFDC is?
MRa PATTON*

Well, I -- Mr» Justice Brennan, I’m

not prepared to guarantee that that occurs.
them,

They are upgrading

I know, for example, in — 1 understand that when this

case started in Vermont the maximum benefit was 50 percent of
the previous salary.

It's now 60 percent of the previous

salary.
In conjunction with minimum wage law, there is some
upward movement, but I think it is true that people in the
low-income groups are going to have lower benefits,
QUESTION*
HR, PATTON*

Yes,
Now, since this is a divided argument,

I've used up my time and I want to stop, but I want to
reiterate

one point that we made in our rap3.y brief .
We don't contend that the mandatory bar is the wisest

or the most socially desirable policy that could be devised,
but we do contend that it is the policy that Congress adopted,
and that rejection on constitutional grounds vrould involve
the Court in factors which it has repeatedly rejected as
inappropriate for judicial resolution.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr, Kalib

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP DAVID L„ KALIB, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT PHILBROOK
MR» KALIBs

Mr. Chief Jusfcice, may it please the

Court s
My name is David Kalib, and I represent Appellant
Philbrook and the State of Vermont in this action#
Vermont’s position is that an unemployed father is
excluded from receiving public assistance benefits under the
Unemployed Father segment of the AFDC program if he’s either
eligible to receive or is currently receiving unemployment
compensation benefits.
And this position is primarily based upon our
understanding of congressional intent that was incorporated
into the January 1968 amendments to the Social Security Act.
The House Ways and Means Committee in 1967 considered
a vast number of amendments to that Act, and they expressed an
intent in the Committee Report to cut federal spending by
reducing the public assistance rolls#
In addition to cutting the federal spending, they
wished to get public assistance recipients back into the labor
force.
The 1967 House-Senate Conference Committee also
considered the same vast number of amendments to the Social
Security Act.

They looked at two versions of how to treat

unemployment compensation in relationship to public assistance

17
benefits.
First, there was the Senate version, which retained
the option of allowing States to supplement unemployment com­
pensation benefits.
The House version, on the other hand, denied assistance
to any unemployed father who was receiving unemployment compen­
sation.
This

House-Senate Conference Committee recommended

to the Congress the adoption of the version formulated by the
House Ways and Means Committee; namely, the version that
denied benefits to any unemployed father who was receiving
unemployment compensation.
Thus it's pretty clear the intent of Congress was to
enact a version to reduce federal spending, and at the same
time cut the welfare rolls.
And in addition this Conference Committee report
recognized that the word "received" was either equivalent to
or equated with the term "qualified to receive".
Since 1968, —
QUESTION:

Could this probably be solved by having

the State provide in its statute that in no event shall the
AFDC benefits exceed the amount of unemployment compensation
insurance, or would you run into other problems there?
MR. KALIB:
problems.

I think you would run into other

18
It would still go against the mandatory bar in
Section 607^ if you established that»
And I think we'd be in trouble with federal matching
fundsf in violation of the AFDC program.
Since 1968, the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, along with the State of Vermont, — and I can’t speak
for any of the other States? but on the best information I have,
th©y*ve all been interpreting this congressional intent to
exclude a father who has not developed and exhausted his
unemployment compensation benefits.
In other words, if he is eligible for those unemploy­
ment compensation benefits, he must go there first and exhaust
those benefits prior to any application for public assistance.
The district court decision, which formulated an
option plan of allowing the recipient equally eligible for
both programs to reject the lower benefit.

I think, in terms

of the district court decision, it was phrased that if his
AFDC benefit is higher, he can reject the unemployment
compensation benefit, and vice versa.
This goes against and completely contrary to the
congressional intent of reducing federal spending.

It even

goes beyond the Senate version of restoring the option of
allowing States to supplement.
And the Senate version was ultimately rejected by
Congress

19

Ilie district court plan also establishes an eifcher~or
alternative, and that is the unemployed father can completely
reject his unemployment compensation and rely 100 percent on
public assistance to meet the needs of his children.

And

there is nothing that we can find in legislative intent to
create that scheme.
We think that Congress would realise that this
purpose, the mandatory bar provision, could be accomplished
by a joint reading of Section 402 and Section 407 of the
Social Security Act.
Section 402 mandates each State to require each
applicant for public assistance to develop, utilize and
exhaust all his benefits — excuse me, all his income and
resources that are available.
If we start with that premise and say that an
individual who is eligible for unemployment compensation must
go down and develop and utilise those benefits, and he does
so, Section 407 of the Social Security Act precludes him from
receipt, of any public assistance benefits under the Unemployed
Fathers section.
In addition, adoption of the district court option
plan, which shifts the burden of providing aid to children of
unemployed fathers from the unemployment compensation
insurance trust funds, funded totally from the private sector,
namely, the employers, to the public treasury, and increase

20

the public assistance rolls, again contrary to Congresses
intent back in 1967»
In effect, what the district court option plan does
is legislate an income floor for all unemployed fathers, and
that income floor is based upon the State's standard of need.
Therefore, any unemployed father can forego these
unemployment compensation benefits and get public assistance
up to that State standard of need.
Historically, these programs have been treated as two
separate and distinct programs.

Unemployment compensation has

always been the first line of defense for a temporarily unem­
ployed worker.
This stems back from the initial creation of the Act
in 1935, arid we think this is true today.

We see, just last

year, Federal Unemployment Act extended benefits for those
unemployed who exhausted their normal State benefits.
On the other hand, public assistance benefits have
always been treated as a last resort.

You rely on relief after
$

you've exhausted everything else, and I think this Court
recognized these two principles in the Java case.
As harsh a3 this all seems, particularly with respect
to the plaintiffs in this case, who have received a substantially
less amount of money from unemployment compensation than they
have from public — would have from public assistance, had they
been eligible.

21
Vermont has tried to mitigate or alleviate that
hardship to some extent* and that is by supplementing unem­
ployment compensation through its general assistance program.
Now, I have to admit, however, that the supplement
is not necessarily going to be equal to the difference between
the unemployment compensation benefit and the State standard
of need*
This depends on a host of factors.

One being the

individual’s income, within a prior calendar period? another
being his need»
The State program is entirely State funded,,

It’s

based upon an emergency grant provision, and the individual
applicant must have no other resources available.

If h©

does have resources available, h© has to exhaust those other
resources,
So in some cases the individual will get nothing
from general assistance? in some cases he’ll get an amount
which his total income will be less than the State standard
of need? and in other cases he could conceivably get a grant
which would make his total total income exceed the State
standard of need for a thirty-day pariod.

But it is

available to that applicant*
QUESTION;

How long does unemployment compensation

run in Vermont, 52 weeks?
MR. KALIB:

Well, there is an initial benefit

22
period of 26 weeks.

There is a 13-week extension period under

Vermont statute, for a total of 39 weeks.
As I understand the program now, under the new
Federal Unemployment Act of 1974, there are 13 more weeks
additional benefits that an individual can get, and that I
understand is totally federally funded? and does not come out
of the private trust fund,
QUESTIONs

Well, in this pending tax program, there's

still another 13 weeks, isn't there?
MR, KALIBs
QUESTIONs

That's correct —
It’s 65 weeks or something,

MR. KALIBs

That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

In the Senate version of the new tax bill, the Javits amendment
does tag on another 13 weeks to that.
QUESTIONS But that’s all,you think, fully federally
funded? *
QUESTIONS The final 13 weeks,
MR. KALIBs

The final 13 weeks, as provided for under

the *74 Federal Unemployment Act, is federally funded.

And it

does come out of the —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KALIBs

•— the employmenttrust fund.

QUESTION s
MR. KALIBs

Yes„
As I understand the Senate proposal,

it will be another 13 weeks, again federally funded, and not

23
out of the trust fund.
QUESTION;
HR. KMiIB:
QUESTION:

But so far that's just a —
A proposal, as I -— Senate bill, and it’s going into

conference this week,
MR. KALIB:

That's correct„

As I understand it.

To summarize, our position is very simplistic, with
a very complicated program.

If you are eligible to receive

unemployment compensation, traditionally you have to go and
exhaust that benefit before you can come on the welfare rolls.
Unemployment has been treated differently than any other
available resource, and I think there is specific congressional
intent to treat that resource differently.
And we urge this Court to reverse and remand.
We would like to, if there is time, reserve it for
tomorrow, Your Honor, for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll have to check your

time in the morning, but we'll not take up your case, Mr. Kohn,
we will have only one minute now.

We'll take you up first

thing in the morning.
^ MR. KOHN:

Thank you, Your Honor.
