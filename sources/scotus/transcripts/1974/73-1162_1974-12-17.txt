MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument

next in No. 73-1162, United States against Thomas Joseph Wilson
and Bobby Antonio Bryan.
Mr. Norton, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NORTON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to
review the judgment of that court

reversing the convictions

of respondents Wilson and Bryan for criminal contempt of court
in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York.

Each was provisionally sentenced to serve six

months in prison.
The question presented is whether a trial witness
who refuses to obey a court order to testify may be held in
criminal contempt pursuant to the summary procedures of
Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, rather
than the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 42(b).
Our primary submission is that the district courts
have the authority and the discretion to use summary contempt
proceedings in those circumstances.

We also contend that in

any event in the particular facts of this case, summary
contempt procedures were, properly used.

4
Aespohclenfcs Wilson and Bryan both refused to obey
the orders of the district court that they testify at the
trial of nnp Robert Anderson on charges involving two baric
robberies.

One of them the Mamiet Bank and the other the

Empire Bank.
Prior to the trial Bryan had been indicted for
robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon concerning the
Nanuefc robbery.

Wilson had been similarly indicted concerning

the Empire robbery.

Bryan had pled guilty to the assault

charge and Wilson to the robbery charges against him, and in
both cases the other charges were dismissed.
Shortly before the Anderson trial was to begin,
Bryan had been sentenced by Judge Cooper, 10 U.S. Code 4208(b),
which provides for a study of the defendants and a resentencing
after a period of three months, but which requires initialiv
the maximum sentence be imposed, in this case 25 years.
Before the trial began, Judge Lasker, who was
assigned the Anderson case, had been told that it would probably
take about two and a half days.
eventually Bryan

In the course of the trial,

was called as a Government witness to testify

concerning the Nanuet robbery, and Wilson was called to testify
concerning the Empire robbery.
incarcerated, Bryan

At this time both were

on his sentence on the assault conviction,

Wilson awaiting sentence on his robbery conviction.
Now, there is a common pattern of events concerning

5

both contempts.

First, all proceedings occurred in open court

with the jury absent.

Each one was asked questions by the

prosecutor concerning Anderson and the respective robberies
beginning with did they know Anderson.

f

They refused to answer

any questions.
The district court granted them immunity pursuant
to .18 U.S. Code 6003 and explained the consequences of that
grant of immunity.

He 3aid that he would hold them in contempt

if they refused to answer.
Each again refused.

The district judge directed

them to answer and said he would hold them in contempt if they
refused. They again refused

e

and he held them in contempt.

The court had already received arguments from the
attorneys for Wilson and Bryan as to their grounds for refusing
to testify.

At this time the court heard additional arguments

concerning the sentencing of both Wilson and Bryan

,

what

alternatives the court could consider and what their motivations
and reasoning might have been.
Wilson's attorney specifically acknowledged that his
motivation was to save a friend.
The court then gave Wilson and Bryan each the
opportunity to be heard and each declined to speak.

Judge

Lasker then sentenced each of them to six months at this time,
as he put it, but he made it clear that this was a provisional
sentence subject to revision and that he would consider an

6

application for reduction.

He made it consecutive to the

sentences they were or would be serving for their other
convictions in order to give the sentence reality and said
otherwise there would be no point to it.

And he specifically

noted in sentencing Bryan, whc was the first of the two to be
sentenced, that a purpose of the sentence was to persuade
Bryan to change his mind and to testify.

And he said he would

reduce the sentence to nothing if he did.
Later the same day both sides rested the case against
Anderson.
There are certain facts before I go into the consequences
of their refusals that are peculiar to each of the respondents,
and I will note them briefly, although we don't believe they
are material to the central question presented.
Though notice of the Government's intention to call
Bryan as a witness, Bryan's original attorney had been unable
to attend the Anderson trial.

He did submit a document setting

forth some arguments as to why he thought Bryan should not be
required to testify.

At the court’s request,Wilson*s attorney,

who was in court prepared to address a similar problem concerning
Wilson, agreed to represent Bryan.
In the course of the proceedings against Bryan it had
been argued that one reason they declined to testify was a
fear that it might affect their sentencing, in Bryan's case
his eventual resentencing by Judge Cooper.

Now, this is a baseless

7
fear in this case because in pleading guilty and in discussing
the case with the probation officer in connection with the
presentence investigation, they had already been required to
snake and did make admissions concerning their involvement,
although in the course of that Wilson declined to identify his
accomplice.
In a*»y event, in order to avoid any basis for such
a claim of possible effect on sentencing, in Wilson's case
Judge Lasker decided he would try to sentence him then before
he testified.

The court heard the probation officer report on

what he 'would have included in his presentence investigation
report, which included an admission of Wilson's involvement in
the robbery,and also heard a presentation by Wilson's attorney
as to Wilson’s background, his family problems, and the
substance of the report by a doctor in which the doctor referred
to Wilson as having an adolescent loyalty to defendant Anderson.
Now, in making this effort to sentence Wilson the
judge stressed that he thought that a delay in Anderson's trial
and others scheduled to follow it was undesirable and ha noted
particularly the fact that Anderson was in jail.
Finally, however, Judge Lasker concluded that he
would rather defer the sentencing of Wilson who was, after all,
facing the potential sentence of 20 years on a very serious
charge, and at a later time he sentenced him to treatment under
the Youth Corrections Act.

8

Neither Wilson nor Bryan took advantage of the
opportunity to reconsider their refusal and to testify,
although it was admittedly a limited opportunity of several
hours that day before the Government rested, its case.
As a direct result of their disobedience of the
court orders that they testify, the administration of justice
was seriously obstructed in this case.

Acknowledging that

the Government's case against Anderson concerning the Nanuet
robbery had been substantially weakened by Bryan's refusal
to testify, Judge Lasker granted Anderson's motion for
judgment of acquittal at the end of the Government's case.
That case was irrevocably lost.
Now, as to the Empire robbery, Judge Lasker noted
that while Wilson's testimony was not perhaps essential in
the sense that it was a priroa facie sufficient to send the
case to the jury, it was not cumulative either.

So the case

went to the jury, the jury disagreed, and as a result of. fcha hung jury, there had to be a second trial with consequent
cost to judicial and other resources.

At that second trial

as it turned out Anderson vras convicted concerning the Empire
robbery, but ono can safely assume that if Wilson had
testified at the first trial, we might never have had a
second trial.
On appeals by Wilson and Bryan, the Court of Appeals
reversed.
/i
t

•

)

/

-

It held first that neither one of them had any

9
legal basis for refusing to testify once they had been granted
immunity.

And the court noted

in passing that if they had

been simply concerned about the effect of their testimony on
sentencing, there were other and better remedies to deal with
that problem such as sealing the transcript or asking that they
be sentenced by a different judge.

Their remedy of ref vising

to obey the court's order to testify, the court of appeals
said was a wholly improper approach to that problem.
The ground for the reversal of the convictions was
that the Court of Appeals concluded that the use of summary
procedure of Rule 42 (a) is improper in the case of an orderly
refusal of the witness to comply with a court order that they
testify even if the witness is represented by counsel and
even if the witness has an opportunity to be beard.

The court

felt that this result was compelled by its decision ir. an
earlier case, the Marra case,in which it had said that if it
were looking at the question on a clean slate, it would uphold
the use of summary procedure in those circumstances, but it
felt disabled to do so by what it thought was the teaching of
this Court's decision in Harris v. United States, to which I
will return shortly.
As we note1 in our brief at page 23, other courts
of appeals have sustained convictions pursuant to Rule 42(a)
in similar circumstances, and it disagreed in effect with the
Second Circuit’s analysis in this case.

10

Now, criminal contempt comprehends a spectrum of
offenses of varied types and degrees of seriousness»

Therefore,

it is important to focus precisely on the question here.
This case presents no claim of abuse of the summary contempt
power by a judge embroiled in a heated controversy with a
witness or a party or an attorney.

Nor is there any claim

of a right to a jury trial since the sentence in this case,
the maximum sentence here being six months.

Nor do we have

here a staged recreation in the presence of the court- of a
contempt that was actually or originally committed elsewhere.
The question here is simply whether a so-called
respectful refusal of a witness to obey the Court's order
to testify or to give evidence at trial can be punished
summarily as a criminal contempt.
QUESTION:

Mr. Norton, was there any formal

objection to the use of the summary procedure?
MR. NORTON:

There was not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Before the court had granted immunity to the witnesses there
was a passing comment by Wilson's attorney to the effect
that she wanted more time to consider or research the
privilege question which.they were then discussing.

But that

issue evaporated from the case once the court granted the
witnesses immunity, and there was no objection raised to the
summary procedure as to either witness.
Now, the question — this Court has not previously

Xi
directly resolved the question in. this case, although it did
in dictum in the Yates case approve the procedure that was
followed by Judge Lasker here.

Mow, 18 U.S. Code 401 authorises

Federal courts tc punish by imprisonment various contempts,
one of which is disobedience of its lawful orders.

It's

not disputed here that the refusals of Wilson and Bryan to
obey Judge Lasker’s order that they testify constitutes
criminal contempt punishable under 401.

Incidentally, I

should note that although the district court docket entries
recite conviction under 13 U.S.C. 402, it is olear that the
court intended and the parties here understood that it was
a conviction under 18

401.

Section 402 is by its terms

plainly inapplicable.
Now, that a refusal to testify may be punishable
under these circumstances as criminal contempt is clear from
this Court’s decision in Harris and other cases.

It is

also clear that disobedience of a court order to testify is
a serious type of contempt.

This Court said in the Shillitani

case that the power of a court to compel a witness to testify
is essential to the administration of justice.

In Caiandra

it noted that every citisen owes his Government the basic
obligation to testify when so ordered.
Now, the reason that the public has a right to every
man’s evidence, as the Court said in the Nixon case is that
the integrity of the judicial system depends upon full

12
disclosure so that innocent persons do not suffer nor the
guilty escape.
It is important to note in this regard that the
principle we contend for her is inherently mutual in operation.
It does not necessarily favor the prosecution, although in
this case it might.

The same question would arise if a

defense witness refused to testify when ordered to do so by
the court.

In such circumstances the consequence of

recalcitrance might not be limited to the extended incarceration
of a defendant, but rather could result in a conviction of
an innocent person.
The central issue here is whether the summary
procedures of Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure were properly used in this case.

The case is squarely

within the terms of Rule 42(a) in that Judge Lasker saw and
heard the contemptuous conduct and it occurred in the actual
presence of the court.

Moreover, summary disposition in this

case is consistent with the purpose of Rule 42 in distinguishing
between those contempts which should be subject to the notice
and hearing requirements of Rule 42(b) and those covered by
42(a) where summary disposition is appropriate.
The use of the summary contempt power is justified
in part by the fact that contemptuous conduct often disrupts
ongoing proceedings.

There is therefore a need for swift

adjudication of wfoether the conduct is justified and lawful

13
and whether it should be punished so as to end the disruption.
The need for dispatch is perhaps especially great with a
recalcitrant witness, trial witness, in a criminal case,
particularly a jury trial, whether it’s a prosecution witness
or a defense witness.
trial.

The defendant has a right to a speedy

The courts and prosecutors have obligations to proceed

promptly.

Defendant may well be incarcerated,so that any

delay in the trial for a side excursion on the contempt
proceedings^

as in this case, for retrial because of a

hung jury, puts a penalty on the defendant.

If a defendant

is ultimately acquitted there is no 'way to recoup that lost
liberty.

Also, where a jury trial is involved a suspension

of the proceedings to comply with the notice and hearing
requirements of 42(b) creates additional difficulties and
expense.
Wow, where the contempt consists of refusal in the
court’s presence to obey an order to give evidence at trial,
there is no need for a formal hearing required by 42(b), the
primary purpose of which is to gain facts and to resolve
factual disputes.

The essential facts are known to the judge.

In many such cases, as here, the reasonsfor the contempt will
also be known, the circumstances leading up to the original
refusal to give evidence and the order to testify.

If there

are relevant facts which are not known to the judge or other
matters that might bear on whether the defendant or the witness

14
should be held in contempt or the question of sentencing, they
can be brought to the court’s attention afterwards.

As the

Court noted in Groppi and again in Taylor v. Hayes, courts
commonly modify contempt judgments on the basis of subsequent
presentations or developments.

In this case, Wilson and Bryan

had more than Rule 42(a) would entitle them to.

They had

opportunities to explain their positions before they were
ordered to testify and before and after they were held in
contempt.

They had counsel to advise and assist them and

they had the substance of a hearing.
Moreover, since conviction, neither one has made any
effort to make any presentation to the district court of any
matter that might have borne on whether they should be held in
contempt or whether the provisional six months sentence was
appropriate.

They have not sought any kind of reconsideration

or additional hearing or tendered any matters of any kind,
beyond offering speculations as to what might have happened
had there been a fuller hearing than they in fact had.
In cases that are indisputably subject to the summary
contempt power, there is likely to be a greater basis for
speculating that a hearing might have been useful.

In such

cases there has been no prior opportunity, as here, to make
some explanation of why you are doing what you are doing, and
in many of those cases the conduct where the witness or the
defendant throws a chair or somehow is abusive to the court

15
there is greater reason for thinking that there is some
background causative factor that deserves some further
exploration, yet summary contempt is properly upheld. And if
the mere speculative possibility of seme kind of extenuating
circumstances were to be accepted as sufficient reason not to
use summary contempt,

there might never be a case where a

court could safely exercise the power that all concede it has.
Now, the summary imposition of the contempt in this
case is consistent with the propositions that the court should, in
the contempt area, use the least power adequate to the needs of
the occasion and should resort to criminal contempt only if
civil contempt would not be efficacious.

As Judge Lasker

knew, civil contempt in this case could be effective only for
a brief period.
in the trial.

There were only a matter of hours remaining
One could reasonably assume that Wilson and Bryan

would be willing to spend those hours to save a friend.
QUESTION:

Were they then incarcerated or —-

MR. NORTON:

They were, and that’s my next observation

that — first, in any trial there is not likely to be a long
period of potential coercive confinement.

But in this case,

in addition, they were both incarcerated already so that any
additional incarceration or confinement in civil contempt would
have been superfluous.
QUESTION;
different place.

It would have been just confinement in a

16
MR. NORTON:

That’s true.

That'a true.

As Judge

Lasker recognized in making the contempt sentence run consecu­
tively to their sentences on their convictions, this he could
not do with civil contempt.
Now, in a case where civil contempt might be
appropriate because there is a sufficiently long period of
confinement, a grand jury witness would be a good example,
and the witness is already incarcerated, you might have a
different situation because in some such cases, at least if
it was a prisoner serving an adult sentence imposed by the
same court, it might be possible for the district court to
suspend the execution of that ongoing sentence for the period
of the confinement on civil contempt.

This is a novel approach

recently sustained by the D.C. Circuit Liddy case and by the
Seventh Circuit in Anklin case.
However, this was not an option that was a feasible
one in this case because there were only a couple of hours
left in the last day of the trial.
On the other hand, the deferral of contempt
proceedings required by 42(b) is not entirely satisfactory
here either.

That approach tends to forego the opportunity to

coerce compliance during the period that might be meaningful.
It's almost totally punitive.

Judge Lasker recognized here

that summary imposition of criminal contempt had a possibility
of coercing these people to change their minds and testify.

JL i

They had to face the likelihood not only that if they had not
been in jail they would have to serve some time, but if they
didn't purge their contempt, they would have to serve whatever
full sentence was imposed.
Let me turn now to the question whether the
district court's approach in this case is foreclosed by this
Court's decision in Harris.

The question presented in Harris

is whether a grand jury witness disobeyed a court order to
testify was properly held in criminal contempt pursuant to the
summary procedures in 42(a) where the original refusal occurred
in the grand jury room out of the presence of the court and it
was recreated in the presence of the court.

Also, unlike this

case, the witness had unsuccessfully requested an adjournment
and opportunity to present witnesses,

in a five to four

decision reversing its earlier decision in the Brown case this
Court held that although the refusal constituted criminal
contempt, it should have been proceeded against under the
notice of hearing at^d requirements of Rule 42 (b) since the
real contempt was not in the presence of the court.
The dicta relied upon by respondents in the court of
appeals, the majority indicated that Rule 42(a) was reserved
for exceptional cases involving this behavior of various
sorts.

Even so, the Court indicated that it was not holding

42(a) inapplicable to a case like this because it's expressly
assumed that 42(a) may at times apply to testimonial episodes.

We have addressed in our brief the historical
argument as to whether summary contempt power can ever be
applied to disobedience of court orders as distinguished from
misbehavior, and X will not address that further here.

I note

simply 'that a witness* refusal to obey a court order to testify
or to give evidence is likely to create, as her®, a far
greater obstruction to court proceedings than many of the types
of misbehavior for which summary contempt power is unquestioned.
Now, the contempt in Harris involved a grand jury
witness, and here we have witnesses at a trial.

There is

far greater need for speedy action at a trial because a grand
jury can last 18 months or mors and civil contempt may be.
summarily imposed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Norton, don't you think the court

that decided Karris would probably decide this case against
you?
MR. NORTON:

I would not think 30.

It's not

necessarily compelled by Harris. We don't have here the problem
of kind of staging the contempt, in the presence of the court
in order to come within the terms of Rule 42(a).
QUESTION:' On the other hand, the court that decided
•>
Brown a plesheri, would decide this case in your favor.
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:

No question.
Well, the difference in Harris was that

you don't have 12 jurors and witnesses and the whole mechanism

19
of the Court standing by waiting.

As you pointed out, a grand

jury could take the matter up 30 days or 60 days later.

But

a petit jury would be difficult to hold -- a petit jury trial
would be difficult to hold intact.
MR. NORTON:
few days.

That’s right.

Most trials only take a

The statistics for 1974 in the administrative office

of the U.S. Court show that 84 percent of all cases take 3
days or less, and even 73 percent of criminal jury trials take
3 days or less.

And indeed, more than 50 percent of all trials

take one day or less.

So that summary -- the interruption or

delay of proceedings to comply with Rule 42(b) would have no
coercive possibilities.
In short, we don't believe that Harris compels this
reversal of the convictions in this case and that if it is
regarded as barring those convictions, it should be limited
or overruled as necessary.
I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Vary well.

Miss Ginsberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA M. GINSBERG
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT THOMAS JOSEPH WILSON
MISS GINSBERG:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

In this case, without valid justification therefor

the Government asks this Court to approve a criminal convection
and six months sentence without an opportunity to defend

20
against that imposition.
There are a few facts surrounding the contonat in this
case that I would like to emphasize.

First, that the contempt

— forgive me, the refusal to testify at all times was orderly
and respectful.

The witness was called to testify before the

same judge —■ this is respondent Wilson — was called to testify
before the same judge who was to eventually sentence him on the
underlying bank robbery charge.
QUESTIONs

Weil, on the question of his being

respectful or disrespectful or otherwise, what difference does
that make in terras of holding up a trial of a jury case where
you have 12 or possibly 14 jurors, with alternates standing by
and witnesses standing by and approaching the end?
MISS GINSBERG:

Well, your Honor, I believe the

distinction is that the purpose of summary power is not just
to move the trial along, but to preserve the authority and the
dignity of the court.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the tttfo?

You think

the two are not linked together?
MISS GINSBERG;

Well, there may be some links, but

I might add that precipitous summary action may well do more
to infringe upon the authority and dignity of the court than
the short adjournment of perhaps 24 hours so that a hearing
can be held to allow the accused condemner an opportunity to
defend.

I mean, in answer to what 1 perceive to be your Honor's

21
concerns during the assistant's argument, trials are
frequently adjourned for short periods of time without the
calamity befalling the system that the Government now suggests.
Adjournments are granted in criminal trials for much less
f.

consequential reasons.
The point is that in fact adjudications of criminal
contempt are not exempt from procedural due process and in
this case there was no reason, no valid reason for not affording
respondent Wilson the opportunity to defend against the charge.
Now* when respondent refused to testify, he did so
on the grounds that even the grant of immunity would not protect
him from use of his testimony against him at the time of
sentence.
I would like to point out at this juncture that there
was other liability within the context of this testimony,
because had ha testified, he would have been subject to crossexamination by defense counsel.

And he was just not subject

to liability as to th© facts of this crime, but there were other
areas perhaps- and 1 don't suggest that they definitely exit
here, but there is a possibility that he would be subjected to
greater liability
QUESTION:
to2

by

the cross-examination of defense counsel.
What kind of liability are you referring

I'm not quite clear.
MISS GINSBERG:

Well, on cross-examination, for

example, the defense counsel would ask Mr-. Wilson to impeach

22

his credibility about the commission of other crimes.
QUESTIONS

How would that injure him?

He could only

impeach him with convictions that were of record, as a matter
of public;record, isn't that so?
MISS GINSBERG: Well, that is so, but whether or not
they were known to the probation department withoug Mr.
Wilson's testimony is another question.

I have to hasten.to

add that I don't suggest that there were those other crimes
committed here, but there is that possibility.
QUESTION:

Miss Ginsberg, I asked Government counsel

as to whether there was an objection made to the summary
procedure here.

Was there?

Do you feel there was sufficient

objection there?
MISS GINSBERG:

Yes, your Honor, I feel there was

and the Second Circuit specifically held that there was.
Counsel not only objected — or requested, rather, continuance
to enable time to research the legal issues.

She specifically,

and I believe it's at page 5 of the appendix, specifically
objected to the hasty determination of this issue which subjected
respondent Wilson to heavy criminal penalty.
QUESTION :

Let me ask you another question now that

I have you interrupted.

Are you here, are you bottoming your

position in the case on due process on the constitutional ground
or on the supervisory power of this Court?
MISS GINSBERG:

Well, your Honor, I argue, of course,

23
that there is a due process right to a hearing and I would
also rely on the supervisory powers of the court to preclude
from the ambit of Rule 42(a) an orderly, respectful refusal
to testify.
QUESTION;

This is a Federal case.

The next one

might be a State case and our supervisory power might not exist
in the State case.

Hence, I was wondering whether you were

reaching for a constitutional ground.
MISS GINSBERG;
QUESTION:

Well, as I said —

Don't you think Harris was just a construe

tion of a rule?
MISS GINSBERG;
QUESTION;

That's all you need, isn’t it?

MISS GINSBERG:
QUESTION;

Well —

It's all that I need, yes, sir.

But it isn't all that the next case

needs coming out from the State side.
MISS GINSBERG;

No, that's true.

In any case, Judge Lasker,recognising the viability
of respondent’s claims attempted to sentence him before
acquiring his testimony.

However, after hearing the probation

officer and defense counsel, the judge concluded that he did
not have sufficient information, particularly of a psychiatric
nature, to adequately sentence the respondent on the bank
robbery.

He then determined that respondent’s Fifth Amendment

rights did not extend to protect him from use of his testimony

24
at the time of sentence for the bank robbery , and he ordered
respondent

to testify.

When he refused, he immediately held

him in contempt and sentenced him to six months in prison.
We contend clearly that this was error.

The

adjudication of criminal contempt is not exempt from due
process considerations of notice and a hearing.

In Harris

this Court specifically held that Rule 42(b) and the notice
and hearing provision therein provided the general or the
normal procedure for dealing with contempt in the Federal
regime.

Harris went on to say that this would give the

accused condemner an opportunity to present legal defenses to
the charge of contempt and also to present facts in litigation
of 'the charge or the penalty.
Now , in this case had counsel been given that
opportunity, there was much that she could have done by way
of defense for Wilson.

In the first instance, as I just noted,

there was some indication in the record of psychiatric problems.
Now, the Government tries to dismiss this as of little
consequence, but the fact remains that Judge Lasker was
convinced that there was some need for psychiatric

treatment

and he specifically indicated his intent to incorporate that
psychiatric treatment within the sentence for the bank robbery.
Clearly psychiatric problems are relevant to determining
Wilson’s responsibility for refusing to testify, and if not
that far, they certainly are relevant in mitigation of the

25
sentence.
Moreover , there was a real —■

in which there was a lot of

It was suggested that he might have been insane,

require men3 rea, because if it were only the objective
conduct, then I suppose an insane person could have been

QUESTION:
of contempt citation'

Aren't you aware that the vast majority
penalties are reduced after their

original imposition?
MISS GINSBERG:

Well, that may well be, your Honor,

but I think that as a general principle of law and as it
applies in this case, a Rule 35 motion is insufficient to
compensate for the deficiencies of this procedure.

Firstly,

a Rule 35 motion does not go to the imposition of the criminal
conviction.

And, secondly, I think that what that procedure

countenances is the imposition of a final sentence based on
inadequate information.

It places the respondent in a position

of coming into court and convincing the judge that his
initial decision was incorrect.
QUESTION:

I can understand your position about his

possible mental condition if he had engaged in disruptive
conduct, as in the case that Mr. Justice Stewart referred to.
Here he was casting his refusal on strictly legal grounds, x-zas
he not?

And there was no disruption of the courtroom.
MISS GINSBERG:

True, there was no disruption of the

courtroom, but ~QUESTION:

No misconduct of any kind.

MISS GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

None.

No misbehavior.

Except the refusal in itself.

flISS GINSBERG:

But clearly there are levels of or

brands of incompetence which go to the witness: inability to

27
comprehend the obligation to testify that would seem —* and
in fact, the per curiam that I was thinking of, if my memory
serves me correctly, deals with a refusal to testify, of
testimony before a grand jury in any case.
It would seem to me that there are certain varieties
of incompetence that would certainly go to that.
There were other facts here which clearly counsel
could have presented at a hearing had she been given the
opportunity.

First of all, there was a confusion as to the

extent of Wilson's Fifth Amendment privilege, how far it would
protect him.

Judge Lasker and the prosecutor were both

laboring under the misconception that his Fifth Amendment
privilege did not extend to the sentence.

Judge Lasker

believed that, there was no way to protect Wilson from
having a sentence and the judge use his testimony.

And in

fact he didn't have the right to protect the sentencing
judge from doing that.

The Second Circuit, in fact, in its

opinion set forth the procedure whereby Wilson could have been
protected;had counsel been given the opportunity she requested
of a continuance.

It's entirely possible that she would have

come up with this procedure and thereby obviated the whole
need for the hearing.
QUESTION:

Is that a statutory procedure or one

worked out in the Second Circuit?
MISS GINSBERG:

I believe it was one worked out in

28

the Second Circuit, but not just on this appeal.

They rely

in their opinion on United States y. Goldberg which was the
case the prosecutor handed up to the judge during this hearing.
But everything was done with such haste and, with all due
respect to Judge Lasker, in such a cursory fashion that it was
never — the procedure was never thought through and nobody
ever realized, or at least articulated at the hearing, that
Wilson could be protected by testifying, having the record
sealed, and then having his sentence transferred to another
judge.
QUESTION:

And that protection is not against self-

incrimination but against reprisals in the penitentiary and
so on, isn’t it?
MISS GINSBERG; No, your Honor, it's a Fifth
Amendment —
QUESTION s

But I am talking about the protection

procedure that's been worked out.
MISS GINSBERG;

Well, no, it's to insure protection

or to insure that the sentencing judge does not use the
substance of the testimony to increase the underlying sentence,
in tills case for the bank robbery.
QUESTION t

To insure you get a neutral judge in

the sentencing, isn't that the theory of it?
MISS GINSBERG;
QUESTION;

Exactly.

And the sealed testimony also serves

29
the same function, doe» it?
KISS GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The sealing of the. testimony.

MISS GINSBERG:

Exactly.

I would like to quickly get to the Government’s
justification for the summary proceeding.

They claim that,

despite the language of Harris, which makes it very clear
that summary proceedings under Rule 42(a) are only to be
used in exceptional circumstances.

And Harris defines

those exceptional circumstances as acts in court, acts of
misbehavior which threaten the judge or obstruct the proceeding
or the courtroom, obstruct the courtroom.
The Government argues that the justification in this
case was to compel testimony.

Now, first of all, I must

point out that if the record is clear about anything, it
is clear about the fact that Judge Lasker did not intend to
coerce Mr. Wilson's testimony by sentencing him for
criminal contempt.
QUESTION:

It was punishing him for his refusal

to answer, wasn't it?
MISS GINSBERG:

That’s correct.

But it was not

intended to coerce the testimony, this punishment.

The

judge stayed the sentence pending appeal, and he specifically
told Mr. Wilson that there was no need for him to concern
himself about the sentence at this time.

30

QUESTI QjN;

Isn’t part of it the deterrence of that

kind of conduct witn respect to other witnesses in other
cases?
MISS GINSBERG:

Kell, if in fact that is one of

the purposest it doesn't seem that purpose would he thwarted
by notice of ?A hours and a short hearing.
I would also like to say that the use of criminal
contempt to coerce testimony in violative of the whole concept
of criminal contempt.

Criminal contempt, as your Honor

points out, is to punish, not to coerce.

It's the civil

contempt sanction —•
QUESTION:

You are taking issue with Rule 42(a)

are you?
MISS GINSBERG;

No, air.

No, I'm not.

I'sa just

saying that criminal contempt should not, was not intended
to have as its primary purpose coercion.but punishment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Martin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN 3. MARTIN, JR.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BOBBY ANTONIO BRYAN
MR. MARTIN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think that the issue nosed in this case is one

that is fundamental to our system of justice.

That is, what

rights, procedural rights, do wo give a citizen of this
country before we sentence him to serve six months in jail.
I think that the issue is muddied somewhat by the

31
procedural context in which this case arises, and I think gives
rise to some of the questions which Mr. Justice Blackmun raised
as to whether this is a due process requirement or rather a
requirement of Rule 42.

It seems to me that the respondents

here were afforded a hearing that was not a Rule 42(a) hearing,
but at the same time they were not given a 42(b) hearing.
And I would suggest very respectfully that in determining
whether or not summary contempt power may be used in the case
of a witness who respectfully refuses to testify, we have to
look at the summary contempt power that is contempated in
Ex Parte Terry.

Summary contempt power authorises the

district judge or the trial judge to impose a sentence of
imprisonment without affording the respondent the right to
counsel or the right to say anything in his own defense.

And

it seems to me that the consistent teaching of this Court is
that that type of deviation from what vre normally consider the
due process rights of a criminal defendant can only ba
justified by the most extraordinary need to protect the
dignity of the Court.

And it seems to me that in this case

that great need to protect the dignity of the court is not
present to justify a departure from the more traditional
procedures which due process encompasses.
It seams to me we have a case where these two man,
for different reasons perhaps and in different circumstances,
refused to testify.

I think one of the compelling facts

32
concerning the client I represent, Mr. Bryan, in this procedure
is that he was forced to go forward in the absence of his own
counsel.

Counsel was simply assigned to him on that morning.

That may not seem like a terribly significant fact, but it
seems to me my experience in representing assigned counsel,
representing assigned defendants, is that it takes some time
for a lawyer assigned by the court to develop a rapport with
his client. The rapport that comes naturally if a man has
sought you out to be his counsel does not exist when you are
suddenly thrust upon a defendant.

And it seems to me that

fact here takes away the ability of the counsel to on the
spur of the moment really meaningfully advise the client of
his rights.

And it seems to me the issue here is whether or

not these respondents should have had the right to counsel
before geing sentenced to the maximum sentence possible in the
circumstances, a sentence of more than six months could not
have been imposed.
QUESTION:

One of the consequences of this conduct

was quite serious, was it not, in terms of the results of
one of the trials?
MR. MARTIN:

It certainly was, Mr. Chief Justice,

and all I am suggesting is not that the punishment was not
proper, and indeed I think an argument could be made by the
Government at some future time that in a situation like this
it might be appropriate to impanel a jury so that a more severe

33

It seems to me that once the sentence is imposed# "Well# that*3
what I’ve got to serve#" and

...

A witness who is

confronted with a situation where he is told that# "I am
sentencing you — I am letting the marshal take you into
custody and holding you in civil contempt.

I'm going to set

this matter down for a hearing to determine if you should be
held in criminal contempt and a sentence to be imposed at
that time," a witness in that situation is more likely to come
back the following day and say# "I've thought about it and I
will testify#" than one who has had the final sentence imposed
on him.

So that I don’t think that the remedy that the

Government suggests is the most effective way to bring about
the testimony that they seek to compel here.
It seems to me that the consistent teaching of this
Court has been that summary contempt power is reserved for the
very

extreme case# and it is our submission here that this is

not that extreme a case.

There was no disrespect manifest

to the court that called for the court to vindicate its
authority right then without waiting for a moment so that
people would know that the court's authority exists.

This

is not the situation such as existed in Terry where there was
a violent outburst in the courtroom and the court there set
fine.

There the dignity of the court was affronted and it

must be able to control the procedures in its own courtroom.
And that was, I think# the rationale set forth in Cooke v.

34
United States those outburst distinctions quite clearly.
QUESTION:

There is, Mr. Martin, for me at least

one difficulty that we are dealing here really with the
specific language of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
are we not?

Unless you are suggesting that there is something

constitutionally deficient about the language of 42(a).
MR. MARTIN:

I am.

I am suggesting, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that it is constitutionally deficient, it is a
violation of due process to use summary contempt power in
the situation before the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

I see.
What I am suggesting is that —
But you do concede that the language of

42(a) would permit summary contempt power in the; circumstances
of this case.
MR. MARTIN:

I do, and this is really what I am

addressing myself to at the outset, the fact that really
you have the procedure used here was not 42(a), it was not
42(b).

It was something in the middle.

And I think it was

something in the middle because the district judge recognized
that there were certain limited due process rights that should
attach before you send a man to jail for six months.
QUESTION:

The judge was well aware, was he not,

that the trial was virtually coming to a close very shortly?
MR. MARTIN:

I think that that is true.

It was clearly

35
going -to be a very short trial, and he was aware of that.
But as Miss Ginsberg pointed out, there is nothing in the
court's action — indeed, the court's action totally
contradicts the fact that he was seeking by his order to
compel testimony right then and there, because
the effectiveness.

he stayed

He said, "Listen, X will consider this

again after the appellate courts have passed on it."

So there

is no element here of using this criminal contempt power to
force right then and there the witness to change his mind about
the testimony.
QUESTION:

Your submission requires you, I take it,

to either say that 42(a) is constitutionally flawed or else
this is not a 42(a) case.
MR. MARTIN:

I think it requires the Court to say

that 42(a) is constitutionally flawed in the circumstances of
this case.

I think Terry

indicates that obviously there are

situations where you can impose contempt without giving the
respondent any right to reply.

But I think what the Court

has consistently held from the time Terry was decided to date
is that to justify that radical departure from due process,
you need very strong and compelling reasons showing that the
demoralisation of the court's authority would occur.

And what

I am really submitting is that our system of justice is not
so fragile that it would collapse if people like —
QUESTION:

I go back to the consequences on the other

36
trial.

They were rather ■—
Mil. MARTIN:

the trial.

I think it is true that it disrupts

It has consequences.

Rut those consequences

followed even though criminal contempt was imposed here.
QUESTION:

I am speaking also of the suggestion of

the Solicitor General that there was a serious miscarriage of
justice by the directed acquittal.
MR. MARTIN:

It was directed —-

That’s right.

They dismissed the

three counts involving the bank robbery in which my client
was involved.
of that.

And I don't mean to denigrate the seriousness

And as I said before, I might, if I were back in

the Solicitor General’s office, be prepared to argue that
you could impanel a jury and impose a substantial sentence
more than is imposed here.
All I am suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that
when you impose a sentence as much as six months on an
individual, that you have to afford him some basic due process
rights, a right to notice, an opportunity to present, as
the Court said in Cooke, evidence in either exculpation or
mitigation.
QUESTION:

And was the sentence imposed on the one

defendant who was found guilty — v/as it a new trial?
MR. MARTIN:

Anderson?

Ultimate sentence?

I must

say I just don’t know, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. MARTIN:

A bank robbery so it can be seen it’s

37

a very substantial sentence»
MR* MARTIN;

Most serious.

to ten years for the bank robbery.

My client was sentenced
It's a substantial crime.

And as I say, I don't denigrate the seriousness of what was
dene here.

I'm just simply suggesting that given the

substantial sentence — six months is a substantial sentence.
I have seen men cry when they have been sentenced to three
months in jail.
QUESTION;

But conduct that leads to the acquittal

of a man guilty apparently of a 10-year offense?
MR. MARTIN;

No, sir, I'm not saying it is out of

order with the magnitude of the disruption.

All I am saying

is that before you impose a sentence of that magnitude, you
should give certain minimal due process rights to allow the
respondent to have an opportunity to present to the Court any
facts in mitigation and exculpation.

Having had that right,

I am not saying it would have been inappropriate to sentence
him to six months —
QUESTION;

it
Your alternative argument was that/should

give him — or perhaps it was your colleague's argument — give
him time to think it over until the next day and he might
change his mind.

Does that mean that every time a court is

confronted with a recalcitrant witness, you step all the
proceedings and give him 24 hours to think it over to see if
he is going to —

38
MR. MARTIN:

Well, I think in most instances that

probably is not going to be necessary.

Mr. Morton's statistics

certainly are not in conformity with my experience in the
Southern District of New York where practice primarily, it
seems to me in most cases, you are going to be able to
proceed with other witnesses or other aspects of the trial.
But adjournments of 24 hours ar© not unusual.

If

you have a juzor with the flu,we adjourn cases for 24 hours.
So that I don't see it as a disruption.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

What did he need a lawyer for?
What did he need a lawyer for?

I think

he needed a lawyer, one, to advise him of the serious nature
of the charges, to present to the court — take

the litigation

here, Mr. Justice White, factors concerning the defendant
himself, also factors as to perhaps even introduce evidence
to show that the refusal to testify was not one that was
simply based on a greater loyalty to a friend, but a real
belief that the constitutional grant of immunity was not
coextensive with the privilege.
It seems to me if a man refuses to answer because
he really believes the district court's rule is in error,
that that is a relevant factor to be considered in imposing
sentence.

It seems to me a manwho believes that the court is

wrong, that his constitutional rights, he wants to protect
them, doesn't deserve the maximum sentence possible.

39
QUESTIONS

Ycur point is that the constitutional

privilege against compxalsory self-incrimination has got
subtleties and nuances that a person can’t decide upon by
himself but needs a lawyer to help him decide.
MR. MARTIN:

That’s correct.

Is that it?

And also whether or

not to go forward and testify is a decision in those
circumstances where — this is the point I was trying to make
before — that the witness has to have some faith in the lawyer.
And I think that’s one of the things that bothers me here is
thet my client was asked to make all these decisions and go
forward with a brand new lawyer assigned to him that morning.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

You have about five minutes left, if you have
anything further.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NORTON:

The suggestion that there was no

intention here to give Mr. Bryan and Mr. Wilson an opportunity
to purjure their contempt I think is rebutted by the statement
of Judge Lasker, at page 32 of the appendix, where he
specifically referred to imposing a sentence for a period of
time subject to elimination or reduction of it to nothing
should Mr. Bryan care to testify and answer the questions.
That was plainly his intention and everyone understood it.

40
They chose not to do so.
As for the possibility *—
QUESTION; Where are you reading from?
MR. NORTON:

Rage 32 of the appendix, the middle

of the page.
QUESTIONS

Beginning, "My suggestion is that 1 ara" —

MR. NORTONs

Yes.

a
At other points he said he was making this/provisional
sentence in both cases subject to reduction or reconsideration.
Now, the suggestion that Mr. Wilson's refusal was
based on soma legal issue as to the effectiveness of the
immunity to protect him, X think is also rebutted by the fact
that when counsel said, to consider the motivation for what
*

Mr. Wilson has done, Judge Lasker said, "To save a friend,"
Counsel: “Yes."

It is very clear what was happening here.

This was not someone standing on some legal principle to
preserve the issue.

This was someone who simply didn't want

to talk to save a friend.
QUESTION:

That's all there was to it.

It wasn't clear to him what immunity he

was getting, was it?
MR. NORTON:

It was.

Judge Lasker explained that

and explained that the consequences of immunity, what he
said could not be used against him and that he had to answer
questions put to him.
QUESTION:

And did he say that it couldn't be used

41
by the sentencing judge?
MR, NORTON:

I don’t believe he specifically said

that.

I’m talking about the grant of immunity,

Could lie possibly understand it without getting

MR. NORTON:

Mr. Wilson had his attorney present

and Mr. Bryan was represented by Mr. Wilson’s attorney.
QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

He had somebody else’s

MR. NORTON,:

Yes.

That’s right.

Someone else

whose client had the .identical problem and was prepared to
address it that day.
QUESTION:

Witness the fact that they are so identical

that one of them said that lawyer couldn't represent him in
this Court.

That's hot; identical they are.

Until tills day

they are not identical.
MR. NORTON:
QUESTION:

Well, I can't speak to the —
That's what the record shews in this

42
Court.
MR. NORTON:

Well, they have different factual

situations and they prefer to make different arguments.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

So they are not identical.
Well, they were identical as far as the

question of whether they could be held in contempt when they
refused to obey a court order, they were in the identical
situation.
QUESTION:

I am not — did they have an identical

situation as to immunity?

Did the fact that one and his

lawyer understood immunity mean that the other one understood
the full parameters of the immunity?
MR. NORTON:

If fir. Bryan's refusal to testify was

based on some misapprehension as to the scope of the immunity,
then that is a fact that could have been presented to Judge
Lasker at any time in the 20 months or so since these
confictions were entered.
QUESTION:

I would assume that anybody convicted

for murder can bring habeas corpus 50 years later.

But

that doesn't make the original conviction legal.
MR. NORTON: Contempt is an unusual creature in that
regard and the Chief Justice indicated criminal contempts
are frequently revised after further presentation.
On the question of notice, counsel seemed to assume
that one day would be sufficient.

Now, whether that’s so or

43
not is an open question.

Some courts of appeals have said

that five days notice is required where notice is necessary.
A five-day interruption of the trial would he something very
different indeed and that would be longer than the trial
itself took.
The question of whether sentence under 42(a) has
any coercive effect,. I think is clear that the summary exercise
of the contempt power is inherently coercive.
courts are permitted to exercise it.

That is why the

It is to address

immediately some conduct which obstructs or casts in a bad
light the administration of justice.

If the only purpose

ware punishment, 42(b) would be sufficient.

It is the need

to deal immediately that justifies a summary disposition.
And finally on the

mens rea

question., I note

simply that first yuj. xa not required, that the action be
willful as 402 does, and that in this case the defendant
had entered his guilty plea with no suggestion that he was
not competent to stand trial.

The difficulties in sentencing

a youthful offender on a 20-year maximum burglary count are
very different indeed from determining whether he has
legitimately refused to answer a question.
