MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1742, Train against Natural Resources.
Mr. Norton, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is hers on writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to review the
judgment of that Court reversing the Environmental Protection
Agency’s approval of a implementation plan submitted by the
State of Georgia, pursuant to the Clean Air Act.
The case was before the Court of Appeals on a
petition for review, direct review, pursuant to that Act,
filed by Natural Resources Defense Council, NRDC, and others.
The Court of Appeals set aside the approval on
several grounds, only one of which is before the Court today.
That ruling concerns the substantive standards and the
procedural requirements governing EPA's consideration of a
variance from a requirement of a State implementation plan.
The Court of Appeals accepted NRDC's argument that
all variances, regardless of circumstances, must be treated as
involving postponements of plan requirements, and therefore
are subject to the provisions of Section 110(f) of the Act.

4
EPA disagrees and has, from the outset, construed
the Act as authorizing it to approve variances in at least
some circumstances without reference to Section 110(f).
EPA's position has been upheld by the other four
Courts of Appeals to consider the question.
QUESTION:

You're going to tell us what those

circumstances are?
MR. NORTON:

That's right.

The — both the circumstances and the distinctions,
the differences that follow from these two approaches, because
they are substantial.
The case arises under the 1970 Amendments to the
Act, which substantially rewrote the Act,.and established a
very wide-ranging, complex and innovative program, to try to
deal with air pollution.
It imposes on newly created EPA and the States a
variety of new duties to be satisfied within a fairly
unusual system of statutory deadlines.
Now, before discussing the particular facts
concerning the Georgia plan, I think it will be useful if I
review the statutory provisions involved here with some care.
The case is principally concerned with the program
under the Act to try to deal, control and reduce air
pollution resulting from emissions from existing stationary
sources, not dealing with motor vehicles or other matters.

5
Section 109 of the Act required that EPA promulgate
what are called National Air Quality Standards for certain
pollutants.

The so-called primary standards under the Act,

which are the ones most pertinent today, were to be set by
EPA at a level requisite to protect the public health with
an adequate margin of safety

I'll refer to these as the

national standards.
These standards had to be issued by EPA after rulemaking proceedings within 120 days from enactment of the Act
in December 1970,
They are subject to judicial review, and are also
subject to revision by EPA,
At the same time, Section 10 7 of the Act required.
EPA, within ninety days of enactment, to consult with the
States and to designate air quality control regions, covering
the entire country.
These could be either entirely within a State or
they would cross State lines.
Now, the States also have important obligations and
responsibilities under the Act, consistent with the findings
of Congress that it was a primary responsibility of State
and local governments to deal with air pollution at its source.
Section 107 provides that each State shall have
the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within
the State, by submitting an implementation plan which v/ould

6

show how that State would attain and maintain the national
standards within each region, air quality region, in the
State»
More specifically, Section 110(a) requires that
each State, within nine months of EPA's promulgation of a
national standard., hold public hearings, adopt and submit
to EPA such an implementation plan.
Under Section 110(a), EPA is required to approve
that plan within four months, upon determining that it
satisfies eight tests set forth in the Act.
One is of principal interest here.

And that is

that the plan must provide for the attainment of national
standards as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later
than three years from EPA"s approval of the plan.

Me refer

to this as the attainment date.
QUESTION; As the what?
MR. NORTON;

Atainment date.

The date of attain»

ment of national standards.
QUESTION;
MR. NORTON;

Attainment date.
The plan is also to include emission

limitations, compliance schedules, and other measures
necessary to attain and thereafter maintain national standards.
Congress anticipated that one approach a State could
take in its plan was to include emission limitations which
would be effective at or near the attainment date, which would

7
give ‘the sources affected a lead tine within which to try to
comply with them.
As the effective date neared, if it seemed that a
source might still not be able to comply, a remedy was provided
under Section 110(f), one of the provisions involved here.
That section provides fchats

Prior to the date that

a source of emissions is required to comply with any require­
ment of a plan, the Governor of the State can submit to EPA
a request for a postponement of -die applicability of that
requirement to that source for one year.
EPA is required to approve such a request if it
makes four determinations;
First, that good»faith efforts have been made to
comply.
Second, that the inability to do so was because the
necessary technology or methods were unavailable.
Third, that interim measures have been taken to
reduce the impact of the source on public health.
And fourth, that the continued operation of the
source is essential to national security or to public health
and welfare.
Such a determination by EPA ~QUESTION:
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION:

Is that to be made on a hearing?
Exactly.
Oh.

I just —

0

f!R. NORTON:

Must be made after a formal public

hearing held by EPA itself, and must be accompanied by
detailed findings and reasons -QUESTION:
MR, MORTON:

Hade on that record?
Hade on the record, subject to the

adjudicative proceedings of the EPA,
QUESTION:
HR, NORTON:

That's a postponement?
That's just for a postponement.

And it's subject to judicial review,
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

Unh-hunh.
Now, Congress recognised that the

available knowledge of air pollution problems and resources
of State and federal agencies in 1970 were not necessarily
equal to the task of striking the most refined balance in the
formulation of these plans , and accordingly provided for
research, training, and funding programs.
In addition, lest these initial hastily reached
judgments, or possibly mis judgments, be immutably cast in
steel, the Act also provides for revision of the State plans.
In Section 110(a).
A revision could be approved by EPA only if the State
has held a public hearing on it, and if the revision, like the
original plan itself, complies with the requirements of
Section 110(a) for plans.
Most significantly, the revision, like the plan,

9
must provide for attainment of national standards within the
three-year period.
If it does so, EPA must approve it.
Upon approval by EPA, the State plan becomes the
applicable plan for the purposes of the Act.

The requirements

of the plan are then enforcible not only by the States but
also by EPA and through citizen suits.
And without a revision of the plan or a postponement,
a source that does not comply with the requirement of a plan
once it becomes effective would be subject to an enforcement
action.
To assist the States in this ambitious and cooperative
Federal-Sfcate venture, EPA promulgated detailed guidelines for
the States to use in formulating their plans, covering both
technical and procedural matters, set forth in 40 CFR Part 51.
Now, EPA recognised that many States were not
prepared at that point to engage in the sophisticated tailoring
of the requirements of their plans to the variety of situations
presented in the various regions within the State.
Therefore, the States were initially permitted to
develop emission limitations and other requirements, more like
a butcher than a surgeon, if you will.
For example, a State could determine what was
needed to bring the i^orst source in a region into compliance,
or to permit attainment of national standards in view of that

10

source.

And then to generalize those requirements and apply

tiem to all sources within that region, or to other regions.
Such approaches ~ and this is not the only one —*
bd.lt into plans a degree of overkill, in that many sources
would be required to comply with the requirements which were
not necessary to attainment of national standards.
Now, if the national standard were not being met,
ir a region in 1972, the practicability of attainment within
the three “-year period or sooner might well be governed by
the ability to reduce or control emissions from a single
scarce or a limited number of sources

a power plant or a

stael mill or smelter, refinery, whatever.
And a period of up to the full three years might be
required in order to develop the necessary technology, acquire
th? equipment, install it, and so forth, obtain regulatory
approvals.
If such sources could not attain, or could not
coiiply and attain the national standards prior to the threeyeir period, then that became the attainment date for those
Sfcctes.

This is mid-1975.
There is also a provision for extension of those

daies in some circumstances, but they're not presently of
great moment.
Now, where attainment prior to 1975 was not feasible
fox these reasons, a State still had some choice, as to when

11

to make the requirements of its plan generally effective.
It could make them effective near the attainment date# or
sooner# or perhaps immediately.
As it might well be feasible for many sources to
comply in a shorter period of time# even though such compliance
was not necessary in order to attain national standards.
There's no dispute that the Act permits# and indeed
encourages# these efforts

which go beyond the minimum

requirements to attain standards.
Nov/# EPA anticipated that there would be# inevitably#
a need for some provision for variances# exemptions or
deferrals.

Either because a State adopted plan requirements

that were effective too soon or overly strict# unrealistically
ambitious# or for other reasons#

or because of problems that

were simply not anticipated in 1370# *71# *72, when the plans
were developed.
The energy crisis# the unavailability of equipment#
and the capital problems of various companies being good
examples.
Therefore# EPA concluded that where a variance would
not interfere with the timely attainment or the maintenance of
national standards# it need not be subject to the postponement
procedures of 110(f)# and instead could be treated as a
revision of a plan.
EPA included this interpretation in its proposed

12

guidelines, which were.published, and after receiving comments
by NRDC and hundreds of others, none of which criticized
this interpretation, EPA included this interpretation in its
final guidelines.
Now, while EPA was considering the plans submitted
by the States on the basis of these guidelines, NRDC even
agreed in congressional hearings that this interpretation was
correct, as we've noted at page 31 of our brief.
Having no reason to question its interpretation,
EPA went ahead and approved the plans containing variance
procedures which did not necessarily require resort to the
postponement procedures, and this —
QUESTION;

Those approvals were on the assumption

that none of the variances would take the State or any
stationary source beyond the attainment date?
MR. NORTON; Well, it would not interfere with either
attainment of those standards or maintenance of them after
the attainment date.
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON;

Yes.
NRDC then changed its position and

challenged several of those approvals.

Let me say, this

problem arises —
QUESTION;

Well, it's a postponement of the —

under the State plan, not a postponement of the attainment
date, such as 110(f) would still permit?

13
MR. NORTONs Well, 110(f) would permit the postpone­
ment of the applicability of a requirement of a State plan
to a source.

It might well, as a result, make attainment or

maintenance of national standards impossible, if this were
the worst source in a region and it got a one-year postpone­
ment, it might mean that attainment was not feasible.
QUESTION:

But 110(f), I take it, would, if you

go through the 110(f) procedures, permit the State to postpone
compliance beyond the attainment date.
MR. NORTON;
QUESTION s
MR» NORTON;

As to particular sources.
Yes.

Yes.

It doesn't postpone the attainment date

itself.
QUESTION;

But your — the agency's interpretation

would not — unless you comply with 110(f), you couldn't go
beyond the attainment date?
MR. NORTON; Well, the original interpretation was
not limited to the period prior to attainment.

If a variance

would not result in, or interfere with maintenance of a
national standard, after it had been attained, it could
still be treated under the revision procedures.
QUESTION;

Even though it carried it beyond the

attainment date?
MR, NORTON;
interfering with --

That's right, because it wasn't

14
QUESTIONS

Well, but then —» then you changed your

mind because of the courts, I take it?
MR. NORTON: Well, I'll get to that.
QUESTION;
MR. NORTON;

All right.
There was a change.

By the tine NRDC changed its position, however,
EPA's interpretation had been relied on by the States in
developing their plans, by EPA in approving them, and by
the various sources in determining whether to challenge the
State plans or to seek variances.
Now, with this background, I’ll turn to the specific
facts.
In April 1971, EPA promulgated national standards
for some six pollutants.
Georgia submitted its implementation plan in January
1972, having developed it in the intervening nine months.
In Georgia, like all but five States, there was at
least one air quality region in which the national standards
for one or more of the pollutants was not being met, as of
1972.
And like all but three of the States, where at least
some of the standards were not being met in some region,
Georgia concluded that it was not practicable to attain those
national standards until the end of the three-year period,
mi d-19 75 o

15
I should not that since EPA has approved those
attainment dates, we must accept here the fact that it was
simply not practicable to attain national standards any sooner.
Now, like the majority of States, Georgia made many
of its emission limitations effective immediately or much
sooner than the actual attainment date.

It either gave no

leadtime or a limited leadtime»
As a result, compliance problems were inevitable,
and Georgia adopted the variance statute which is in issue
here»
EPA approved the Georgia plan, including the variance
statute, in mid-172.
Now, as I mentioned, Section 110(a)

contemplated

that the plans submitted by the States would include compliance
schedules, which would be adopted to assure that sources
which in 1972 were not in compliance with the requirements
needed for attainment of national standards, would be by the
attainment date.
This is whether or not the requirements ware immedi­
ately effective or not, and they could either cover categories
of sources or individual sources.
If they had been submitted as part of the original
plans, they would have been subject to approval without
reference to 110(f), and subject only to the standards of
110(a) .

16
However, because of the enormous demands imposed
upon most States by the task of preparing the implementation
plan, Georgia, like most States, simply was unable to complete
the work of developing compliance schedules completely, and
submitting to EPA with its plan a full array of such
schedules.
As a result, after these States submitted their
plans, and indeed after EPA had approved them, they continued
working on the development of compliance schedules and
submitted them to EPA.
They submitted them as revisions of the plans that
had already been approved, not as postponement requests.
There are some 300 of these in Georgia. There are
a total of 3,000 in the States in the Fifth Circuit, and
many more in the other States.
Many of these variance requests or compliance
schedules have already been approved by EPA.
I should note, there's no reason to believe that
this process has resulted in any abuse or undermining of the
purpose of the Act, because they would not be approved
unless they would not interfere with timely attainment of
national standards.

And many are limited periods of time

which have already elapsed»
So, in practical effect, the basic question here
is whether such schedules and variances could only be approved

1?
by EPA in accordance with the procedures of Section 110(f),
or whether EPA properly construed its Act as permitting them
to treat them as plan revisions.
And it's important to emphasise, in view of NRDC's
claims, that the case does not involve merely attempts to
extend the deadlines of previously negotiated compliance
schedules? with possible rare exceptions, these variances
and compliance schedules are the initial submissions, they
are not kind of going around for a second bite at the apple.
NRDC claims, and the Court of Appeals held, that the
only procedure available for EPA's consideration of these
belatedly submitted compliance schedules and variances is
the postponement procedure of Section 110(f),
And they would apparently require a compliance with
110(f), even if the variance would not interfere with timely
attainment of national standards, and even if the problems
calling for the compliance resulted in mechanical breakdowns
or tornadoes, or whatever.
Now, they assume that 110(f) is always an available
alternative.

But, as I noted earlier, by its terms, it’s

available only prior to the time that a source is required
to comply with the requirement of a State plan.
And the States that imposed immediately effective
requirements, without a revision of those requirements, 110(f)
would not appear to be available at all.

18
Evan if compliance was unreasonable, unnecessary,
or a severe hardship or would require closing a plant down.
How, the Fifth Circuit’s position has been
decisively rejected by the other Courts of Appeals, in the
cases we've cited in our brief.

The First Circuit, followed,

by the Eighth and the Second, held that 110(f)

is the

exclusive procedure for considering variances only in the
period subsequent to attainment of national standards.

And

even then, the First Circuit held, that limited variances
could be granted without reference to 110(f), to account for
mechanical breakdowns, acts of God, and the like.
As for the pre-attainment period of principal
concern here, these Courts held that compliance with 110(f)
was not necessary, unless a variance would interfere with
timely attainment of national statndards.
Of course, only rarely in the pre-attainment period
would a variance threaten national standards, because it's
going to run out before the deadline comes, and since air
even .if a source were producing emissions above the standards,
once it stops, in compliance, the air disperses, and by the
compliance date it would be at national standards.
Nov;, these Courts found such authority for variances
without reference to 110(f)

implicit in the very structure of

the Act, in the essential need for flexibility.
Having had its authority sustained as to the most

19

important period, the pre-attainment period, EPA did not seek
revisit by this Court of the limited adverse aspects of those
rulings.
Then, in September 1974, EPA revised its regulations
to accord with the First Circuit ruling, so as to disapprove
all State plans in so far as they authorize variances,
including Georgia's, in the post-attainment period beyond
the limited range permitted by the First Circuit.
Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit held that EPA
could approve what it called the minor variances, those which
would not interfere with timely attainment or maintenance of
national standards at any time, even after the attainment
date, without reference to Section 110(f).
They found this authority necessarily implicit in
the Act, and, like the First Circuit, but,unlike the First,
saw no reason for curtailing that essential flexibility of
the attainment date.
QUESTION:

Does the government show a preference for

the First Circuit or the Ninth Circuit's?
MR. NORTON:

Well, we show a preference for EPA's

original interpretation, which is to root this flexibility
in the explicit revision procedures of the Act.

We don't have

any fundamental disagreement with the Ninth Circuit's approach,
or as suggested by some of the amici that this flexibility,
this provision is implicit in the Act.

20

But as between the First Circuit and the Fifth,
we prefer the Fifth, as we’ve indicated in our reply
brief.
QUESTION;

What about the Ninth?

MR. NORTON:

Well, as between the Ninth and the

Fifth or the First, we prefer the Ninth.
The case is here only as to the pre-attainment
period, so there’s no significant difference between the
Ninth and the First in that regard.
QUESTION:

Do you say you prefer the Fifth to the

First?
MR. NORTON:
choice.

No, the First to the Fifth, given that

'".or'
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Right.
Yeah, the Fifth is the one you don’t

want? that’s what brings you here.
MR. NORTON: We don’t like that one at all.
That’s right.
We contend that EPA’s interpretation of the Act
was reasonable and should be sustained.

As the briefs and

the amici show, that that interpretation has been heavily
relied upon by the States and by the sources of emissions ~~
QUESTION:

I suppose you would just as soon like

to know, also, now as well as any time, whether the revision
can extend beyond the attainment date?

21

MR. NORTON; Well# I’m not going to# you know# play
Brer Rabbit.

Of course# we'd like to know that now. The

case — the question may come up in the Ninth Circuit case.
QUESTION;

Because that's now going to be# I take it#

prospectively your position?
MR. NORTON;

Well# the agency hasn't formally

reacted to the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION;

Well# you're going to have to agree with

some — one court or the other.

[Laughing.]

MRo NORTON; But we —
QUESTION;

You have to wait on the agency pretty

much # don11 you?
MR» NORTON;

Yes.

So far as I know# the agency

does not plan to seek this Court's review of the Ninth Circuit
decision.

The other side may well# if that question is not

resolved in this case.
We think that our rationale for sustaining the
agency’s interpretation as to the pre-attainment period would
equally apply to the post-attainment period.

So if the

Court accepts our rationale# that may foreshadow this»
QUESTION: And if it doesn't cover the post­
attainment period# it shouldn't cover the pre-attainment
period# either?
MR» NORTON:

No.

QUESTION: What?

22
MR» NORTON;

We would there agree with the First

Circuit, that you can distinguish between the pre-attainment
and the post-attainment —
QUESTION; Well, it isn't the same rationale, then?
MR. NORTON;

No, it's not the same rationale? the

same result.
If EPA had adopted the Fifth Circuit’s approach
at the outset, I think it would have been an unreasonable
interpretation which would have disserved the purposes of
the Act, some of the reasons that we've

indicated in our

brief, imposed tremendous burdens and delays, because EPA
itself would have had to hold all the hearings on variances
that the Fifty States held.
The States might have adopted less strict standards
as a result, or made them effective closer to the attainment
date, rather than sooner.
And if presented with the problems of compliance,
they might have revised the entire standard, rather than
grant an exception for the few who have a difficulty,
Nov?, EPA's interpretation is consistent with the
legislative history, limited though it is, as we have
indicated in our brief.

That interpretation was brought to

Congress's attention explicitly without any sign of dis­
approval.

It's in accord with the premise of the Act, that

States have substantial responsibilities.

As we have indicated

23
in our reply brief,, it will not threaten public health, as
EPA suggests, and we believe it's a classic interpretation
of a specialized agency’s reasonable interpretation of its
own statute, in an effort to make its pieces work and set
tine programs in motion.
It’s entitled to the traditional great deference,
particularly where it's been so heavily relied upon? and we
think the Court of Appeals’ judgment should be reversed.
I’d like to reserve the balance of my time,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well, Mr, Morton.

Mr, Ayres,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD E„ AYRES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. AYRES:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
My name is Richard Ayres, and I represent respondents
here.
This case involves the interpretation of the
language of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, a statute which
was passed to expand markedly the government's program to
control air pollution.
The question presented is whether the Act requires
individual sources of pollution, who seek more time to comply
with the requirements of State plans, to seek a federal post­
ponement, and when, if ever, they may approach the State

governments for State lav; variances.
In other words, the question iss

When does the

federal procedure pre-empt the State lav; procedure?
We believe the statute is clear on its face.

The

federal pre-emption occurs as of the time certain, and the
time certain is the date that the State plans were approved.
EPA, on the other hand, has argued that pre-emption
occurs or is triggered only by its own judgment that there
would be a violation of air quality standards,
Now, I think it’s important at the outset to under­
stand why petitioners, or respondents before the Court here,
object to the EPA proposal.
What EPA proposes to do, whenever a source comes
forward asking for additional time to meet a compliance
schedule, is to go through an entire analysis of the impact
of that source on the air quality, that is, the air generally
at ground level, as it would be affected by that variance.
In practice, the way this is done is by feeding
data concerning the given source into a computer model, which
is a very complex set of assumptions, essentially in
mathematical form, about what will happen in the air under
certain conditions, cranking this through the model and then
coming to a prediction on the basis of the model on what
the impact would be on air quality,,
just thats

a prediction

In most cases it is

25
Now, that prediction is subject to a great deal of
error, as you might imagine, and EPA has said, as we have
indicated in our brief, that it may be subject to error of
as much as 100 percent.
At the same time it also means that there is fruitful
ground for objection to any conclusion EPA draws on the part of
any source.

The source may come forward with its own data

from monitors, and say the prediction was wrong; or it may
come forward and say it's the wrong model or the wrong factor
was put into it.
Whatever these possibilities are, there is a fruitful
opportunity there for dispute over whether or not the Air
Quality Standards would be violated.
The second reason why this approach, it seems to us,
is one that should not — should not and was not chosen by
Congress is because it violates the fundamental scheme of the
Act.

The Act is built on the premise that the State plan

begins with an evaluation of Air Quality throughout the State.
The State does that on an aggregate basis, on the basis of
monitors throughout the State.
The second stage is that the State then detemines
how much reduction is necessary in the emissions, that is,
the pollution coming out of the stacks, in order to meet those
Air Quality Standards.
State as a whole.

Again, a general judgment for the

26

It then applies to each individual polluter a
formula to require reductions in emissions from that
individual» and essentially» as you can see, the idea is to
spread the burden of reducing pollution across sources all
over the State.
Now, if you go about looking at each individual
polluter’s effect on air quality» when he comes in to request
a variance, you are then re-examining these general decisions»
but on an individual basis.

And the result will be that if

you hand out a lot of variances, you will end up with a very
unequal burden being placed on the polluters.
Those who have not received variances will be left
with complying, and they will have to pay the cost of that?
those that receive variances, because they've been able to
convince EPA that they won’t violate ambient air quality
standards, will be left with no requirement to reduce
emissions.
The result, we think, would be fundamentally
unfair.
Nov/, these, I think, are the reasons why Congress
chose, in the first place, to require any individual change,
any change in an individual compliance schedule or any other
requirement of the wtate plan with respect to an individual
source, to go through the postponement procedure and not to
be judged on the basis of its effect on air quality.

27
That was too iffy a judgment, and it was too unfair
to go about it that way.
I think we have shown in our brief that the language
of the statute is totally unambiguous.

It states that any

source that seeks a change in any requirement that applies to
it must go through the postponement procedure.
In fact, the importance of going through this
procedure, the importance of the strictness of the procedure
is demonstrated over and over in the legislative history.
As you may have noticed in reading in the Appendix, Congress
originally considered requiring sources fco go to a Federal
District Court to obtain this kind of postponement.
Ultimately they left it to an administrative adjudicative
hearing, as in the final Act.
But this does re-emphasize the importance in
Congress's mind of this procedure as a way to prevent easyescape from the requirements of State plans.
Now, EPA has put forth an alternative interpretation,
which is that somehow through the revision authority of the
law it has the authority to allow States to grant variances
rather than having sources go through this procedure.
We have canvassed this issue rather thoroughly in
our brief, but I think it can be summed up in a rather simple
way.

Revisions clearly are — I think it's clear in the

statute -- something which is set up to allow general changes

28
in a State plan.

If the State, for example, should determine

that it had required stiffer requirements than it really
needs to meet the ambient air quality standards, it would be
free to go to EPA in a general way and ask for a general change
in its plan.

But the burdens of that change would have to be

distributed equally.
It can't go to EPA and ask for individual changes
which would unequally distribute the burdens of meeting the
national ambient Air Quality Standards.
The primary purpose of the revision authority, I
think it's clear in the statute, was to allow for situations
where changes had been made or could be made that would allow
for earlier compliance rather than later compliance„
But, in any case, the revision authority is some­
thing which is to be used to make general changes in the
State plan, not changes applicable to specific sources.
And the distinction, we think, is very clear.
Nov/, this distinction has also been agreed to by
five Courts of Appeals that have reviewed the issue.

All

five of those Courts of Appeals rejected EPA's claim that
it had authority under the revision authority to allow specific
sources of pollution to have more time.
Pour of those five Courts of Appeals agreed with us,
that the trigger, after which the postponement procedure
became applicable, was a date certain, not a judgment about

29
air quality.
The Fifth Circuit chose what we think is the
correct interpretation/ that the date certain was the elate of
approval of the State plan, which of course was 1972 in most
cases.

QUESTION;

That's your position now, it wasn't

always, was it?
MR, AYRES;

No, that’s always been our position.

QUESTION:

Has it?

MRa AYRESs

Unless you're referring to the statement

before Congress that I made, in which case all I can say is
that that was a statement made in the context of a general
attack on the State variance laws6

We believed at the time

that those were too lax, and it was also made in the context
when we really hadn't looked at the lav; closely.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, one Court has

agreed with you as to the time, as to the time of the trigger.
MR, AYRES:
QUESTION:
MR, AYRES:
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

That's right,

Three --

Three have not.
Three,

others —

Four others now.
Well, four others have not.

The three

Courts, the First, Second and Eighth Circuits, agree with us
as to the concept, that is, it's the date certain that
triggers the postponement procedure, not an air quality judg-

30
merit.

But they chose to set that date as the date, the
attainment date specified in the State plan for meeting Air
Quality Standards,
This is confusing.

I think the crucial thing to

notice is that it’s the date set for attainment, it’s not a
question of whether an individual source will affect attain­
ment, that’s the government's position,,

The other three

Courts said it's date certain, it's the date certain that
the States chose to attain the national standard, which in
most cases is mid-1975; although there are some cases where
later dates were chosen through another procedure which is
not at issue before the Court here,
I think it's important also to look at the sugges­
tion EPA has made, that strict construction of 110(f) as it's
written would be burdensome, because I think that's a false
argument,
110(f) does not always require a hearing? 110(f)
requires an opportunity for a hearing.

It requires that there

be findings in an adjudicative proceeding, and that those
findings relate to the availability of technology, the uses
of all the available alternative measures in order to reduce
the effects of the continued pollution during the interim
period, and a judgment about v/hether the source is sufficiently
valuable so that it's continued pollution, at those levels,

31
is cognizable.
EPA has, in effect, admitted that this is not a
terribly burdensome procedure by promulgating the September 26
regulations.

Those regulations require that in the post-*

attainment period the only means for obtaining more time is
through the federal postponement procedure.

And, obviously,

if that procedure were as burdensome as the agency has made
out before this Court, it would not have been willing to
publish those regulations.
In fact, the scheme that EPA proposes, the revision
authority is more burdensome, it involves the States making
an original judgment on the requested variance, a judgment
which includes additional factors besides the ones that are
included under 110(f), such as the question of the effect on
air quality, which is a difficult and expensive determination
to make.
These proposed variances then go to EPA, which goes
over the same set of information, comes to another judgment
on air quality as well as other issues, and if it disagrees
with the State and decides that the air quality impact would
result in a violation of ambient Air Quality Standards, sends
the proposed variance back to the State, where the State begins,
at that point, through the postponement procedure„
This, in our view, is a recipe for delay, it's much
more burdensome than the 110(f) procedure, which is a single

32

procedure with a smaller number of issues to deal with»
In our view, basically, the difference between the
two schemes, with respect to burden, is that the revision
procedure suggested by EPA shifts some of the burden to the
States.

That may be in EPA’s bureaucratic self-interest, but

it's not necessarily in the public interest.
And finally, I think it's important to realize
that EPA's statements about the burden of this 110(f)
procedure ignore the whole purpose of the 110(f) procedure, of
making it a stringent procedure, which was to discourage
sources from seeking additional time rather than compliance.
And if the 110(f) procedure works as it was intended, there
will be fewer requests than there will be if you use the
revision procedure.

In that case, the burden on the agency

will, if anything, be reduced.
I think it’s important to realise that EPA has
brought this case before the Court because, essentially, of
an error that was made in 1972 by the agency $ when the States
first adopted their plans, EPA consented to a confusion in
some State laws between what a compliance schedule was and
what a variance was,

Compliance schedule being a schedule

set at the time emission limitations were adopted, which
gave the source time to comply with those emission limitations
as opposed to a variance, which adds more time on the end.
As a result, EPA now has several thousand in the

33

Fifth Circuit, State law variances which are, in effect,
compliance schedules under federal law.,
Now, this obviously creates a burden if you continue
to operate on the preraise that these will continue to be dealt
with as variances.
In our view, we have no interest or desire in forcing
tire agency to go back through a whole process, which amounts to,
essentially, changing the name of what was called a State
variance and calling it something else.
The Court stayed the order of the Fifth Circuit,
knowing at that time that it would result in EPA’s approving
several thousand variances in tire Fifth Circuit»

Those

variances are approved, and in our —
QUESTION;

Did we stay it or did the Fifth Circuit

stay it?
MR» AYRESs

The Fifth Circuit refused — denied a

request for stay, and the Court —
QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit denied the stay, and

then did we do anything or not?
MR, AYRES;
it was granted.

Yes, the stay request was made here, and

And during that period EPA promulgated

approval of these several thousand variances.
Now, as to those variances, we’re perfectly happy
to leave them where they are.

We believe that, in effect,

they are compliance schedules, and it seems to add nothing to

34

go back and fco try to reclassify those.
In fact, the Fifth Circuit’s order was not one that
would require retrospective application.

The Fifth Circuit

ordered FPA to disapprove the State of Georgia's variance
statute, and it said nothing about retrospective application,
it talked in terms of future application.
So we think that, although we've suggested one
alternative for how to deal with these variances in our brief,
perhaps an equally good or better alternative is

simply to

make — to affirm the lox*er court’s ruling, which would
have prospective effect, and leave the variances, as they
were called before, in place,
QUESTION;

So you would enjoin the agency from

acting in accordance with this ~~ with a contrary view?
For the future.
MR. AYRES:

For the future, we would - we would

have the agency under order to — not to approve any such
State variance, and to order —
QUESTION;
MR, AYRES;

Except as a postponement?
Well, yes, such a procedure would go

through the postponement procedure.
Disapproval of the State variance law would leave
only the procedure of the postponements to go through.
With respect to those future requests for more
time, EPA's September 26 regulation disapproved the State

35

variance statutes, so one stage of what we believe was the
proper interpretation of the Fifth Circuit's decision, and
what this Court should uphold, has already taken places

EPA

has disapproved all the State variance statutes.
EPA also proposed a replacement federal regulation —
QUESTION:

But EPA is not in compliance with the

Fifth Circuit order.
MR. AYRES:

EPA

well, they disapproved all

State variance statutes in compliance with the First, Second,
Fifth and Eighth.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. AYRES;

They then proposed an alternative

federal regulation to replace those, which was in compliance
with the First Circuit.
We believe that proposed regulation should have been
one that was in compliance with the Fifth Circuit, and the
agency would of course be free, in compliance with a ruling
from this Court, to promulgate a regulation that properly
implements the Fifth Circuit rather than the First Circuit
ruling.

I don’t know for sure whether

they live in an area where the source has sought a variance.
QUESTION:

Does the record shed light on this?

MR„ AYRES;

I don't believe it does, no.

The organizational plaintiffs or petitioners, I
think in both cases, sue on behalf of their members, which
obviously is one of the crucial tests, is that there be members
involved in those areas, would be affected by the action? and
I think in both cases the organizational petitioners below
do have members there who would be affected by continued
pollution in those areas.
QUESTION:

Does the record show the number of

members in Georgia?

MR, AYRES:

There is a separate — what it says is:

a petition for review of the Administrator’s action in
approving or promulgating a plan may be filed only in the
United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.
There is a separate section which provides for
citizen suit in certain circumstances, which states that any
person may bring suit.

And 1 think it’s pretty clear in the

legislative history of this section, that the intent was
quite the same in both sections.
QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

So that any citizen can bring suit?
Yes,

Within the constitutional limits,

one must presume.
QUESTION:

I would be interested in a little

canvassing of this question:

Mr. Ayres, take a look at 63a, if you

have it there, of the government’s petition, which sets forth
some of the statutory language.

And I can’t keep all these

sections straight, but in subparagraph capital B that
begins about the middle of 63a:
"Any determination made pursuant to this paragraph
shall be subject to judicial review by the United States
Court of Appeals for the circuit which includes such State
upon the filing in such court within 30 days from the date
of such decision of a petition by any interested person ..."

46
Now, does that govern this particular action that's
here before us now?
MR. AYRES;

No, this ■»- this has to do with the

review of the Administrator's action in granting a postpone­
ment.

1 take it it has only to do with that.
QUESTION:

And what is the section, then, that

authorizes review of the Administrator's action which you
sought to have reviewed in the Fifth Circuit?
MR. AYRES;

That is Section 307 of the Act, which

is Section 1857h~5.

QUESTION:
MR. AYRES:

Right; thank you.
Well, to summarize very quickly,

the — we feel that the issue before the Court is one which
involves the interpretation of the statute, which is very
clear, unambiguous on its face.

And this Court should, in

line with its traditional function, interpret that statute

47
as it reads, and that the agency should, if it believes this
interpretation of the lew as it’s written is incorrect,
take that controversy to a forum which can consider it in
full; which would be, in this case, the Congress»
Thank you very much.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Norton, do you

have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P* NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NORTON;

Very briefly, if I may respond just

to the standing question first, that's been raised.
I think the statutory problems here demonstrate
why the agency’s interpretation should be entitled to great
deference.

The Act is not a really cohesive piece.

There

are different wordings and a different standing, whereas the
judicial review provisions,
I don't know whether the briefs in the lower court
include all of the cases that have been decided on this
question; but we'll see what they do say and submit something
appropriate,
EPA's position, as I understand it, comes down to
the proposition that if a State failed by one day to submit
a compliance schedule as part of its implementation plan,
it would be completely out of the picture.
His concept of federal pre-emption would totally

4B
take over? and there would be nothing left for the State to
do.
We don't see the Act as reading that way.

It would

stand the principle of cooperative federalism on its head
to do so.
On the question of the efficacy of the analysis
of — the effect of a particular source on air quality in a
region:
First, that comes up only in the post-attainment
period.

A pre-attainment variance is not going to have any

effect on the attainment of air standards.
As to the post-attainment period, we've indicated
in our reply .brief, at page 4 that the other side is failing
to distinguish between analyzing the effect of an existing
source and analyzing and predicting the effect of a future
source.
And, finally, on the question ~ the suggestion
that somehow the case is no longer alive because of what has
happened:
First of all, we don't know the consequences of
the Fifth Circuit's ruling on variances which were granted
pursuant to EPA's long-standing interpretation,
I don't suggest the Court has to resolve those
issues, but it does present a live issue for the sources
in the States in question.

49
And notices of citizen suits have been filed in
at least some States.
In addition, some attainment dates extend as late
as 1977.
Thirdly,, the cycle that we’ve gone through here,
of pre-attainment period and attainment date, can be
repeated, because the statute provides for the possibility
of the promulgation of new national Mr Quality Standards,
when EPA determines that there are additional pollutants
that need this treatment.
In addition, they can revise the existing standards,
which would again set in motion the same cycle.
Then, finally, the decision as to the pre-attainment
period does have bearing on what the law is for the post­
attainment period, as I've indicated.
Thank you.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:21 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
