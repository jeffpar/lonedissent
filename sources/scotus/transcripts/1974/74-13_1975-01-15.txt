PROCEEDINGS
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

next in Mullaney against Wilbur, 74-13»
You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Arey „
Do you pronounce it "r-e" or "air-e"?
MR. AREYs

"Air-e'*, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

"Air-e",» all right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERNON I. AREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. AREYs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Vernon Arey, and I represent the
petitioners in the instant case:

Warden Garrell S» Mullaney

of the Maine State Prison, and the State of Maine,
The facts of this case are briefly as follows:
At the trial of the State's case against the respondent
in this case — whom I shall refer to throughout my
discussion as the defendant, since he appeared in that
posture below, and I refer to him as such in my brief — the
State of Maine alleged that Mr» Wilbur had inflicted such
severe injuries upon the victim, Claude Hebert,with his
fists and a blunt instrument that Mr, Hebert died shortly
after receiving this beating.
The theory of the defense was that though this
beating had been inflicted, the actions had been generated

4
by the heat of passion on sudden provocation, because of an
indecent homosexual overture made by Mr, Hebert,
The jury rejected this contention and convicted the
defendant of murder,
QUESTION:

Well, you can hardly call that a

contention in the traditional sense, can you, since he didn’t
take the stand, and it got into the record sort of backward,
didn’t it?
MR, AREYs

Well, Your Honor, I think that depends

upon that tactics of counsel.

Counsel, whether wisely or

unwisely, apparently made the decision that he did not have
to place the defendant on the stand, and chose to do it
through failure to object to the entrance into evidence of
the statements of the defendant as to what happened at that
time, and then relied upon his opening argument to point out
to the jury how he had felt he had met his burden as it was
imposed by the State of Maine.
After a complex procedural history, which need not
concern us here, the defendant in 1971 appealed this case to
the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
Essentially he argued at that time, and in substance,
that the Presiding Justice at

his trial had committed error

when it charged that once the State had proven beyond a
reasonable doubt an intentional and an unlawful killing, that
malice aforethought would be presumed, and that the burden

5
would be on the defendant to mitigate the crime thus proved to
manslaughter of the voluntary type, unless he, the defendant,
established by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime
was committed upon heat of passion upon sudden adequate
provocation.
This has generated essentially one issue in this
case, and that issue is:
Whether, in placing the burden upon the defendant to
show, even by a preponderance of the evidence, the absence of
malice aforethought, the Court has denied the defendant in
this case due process of law under the rationale of In re
Winshipo
The Maine Court rejected any possible Winship
violation on two essential grounds;
First, it recognized that the Maine law establishes
as part of its fundamental system the single generic
concept of felonious homicide? and that once a felonious
homicide is proved, criminality is established.
But more than that in this case, and when I get to
the law of felonious homicide I will again be emphasizing
this, the Maine lav; requires not only the mere establishment
of a felonious homicide with its constitutent elements to
erect the presumption of malice, but a felonious homicide of
a particular type.

And that is a felonious homicide which

is either intentional or which is characterized by acts which,

6

when objectively evaluated, have a very high death “-producing
potential.
If those are proved, the State of Maine establishes
as its policy, the crime is murder, definitionally proved.
The process by which we define this is called the
presumption of malice.
The Maine Court in Wilbur traced the history of
the single generic concept of felonious homicide, as it has
existed in Maine for a hundred years, arid said:
In viewing Winship, we find that the case of In re
Winship is confined to its facts, which essentially is
talking about elements of criminality.

When we are making

the decision in the first instant, whether it be to brand
a juvenile with the label of delinquent, or a man with the
label of criminal, that different factors are involved in
making a determination as to what due process rosans, given
that context.
In Maine, x^e are not doing this in the first instance,
x^e are making a determination as to what the appropriate
penalty shall be for a felonious homicide.
QUESTION:

Mr. Arey, am I correct, your statute

doesn't speak in so many words, "a felonious homicide"?
MR. AREY:

That is correct, Your Honor,

And, as

far as I know, the statutes of Maine have never spoken of
felonious homicide

7
But tracing through the history of this case, I
think it will become clear that this is deemed of no
significance by the courts and has been acquiesced in by the
First Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision.,
The second ground that the Maine Law Court denied
the defendant's appeal on was essentially that the case of
kinship, even if extended, in the view of the Maine Court,
would not be retroactive.

And of course it's conceded by all

that that is not the case, the case of In re Winship has been
made retroactive by Ivan V» v> City of Mew York.
The defendant in this case then petitioned the
District Court for the Southern Division of the District of
Maine — petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging the
same material that he has alleged here, and we are arguing
about before this Court, that he argued before the Maine Law
Court,
Petition was granted with reference to that one issue.
The opinion and order of the honorable Justice Gignoux being
that there is no such thing in the State of Maine, as the
crime of felonious homicide, that the Maine statutes do not
spealc of the crime of felonious homicide, and that the State
of Maine is, in effect, misapplying its own law*
The State timely appealed from that decision of
the District Court, and went to the First Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston

8

Pending the State's appeal to the First Circuit
Court in Boston, the State case of State v„ Rollins, which is
found at 295 A. 2nd 914, and is cited in the brief, is an
important case in establishing what the concept of felonious
homicide is in Maine, was decided by the lower court.
It fully reaffirms the principles which were announced by
Justice Webber in the original decision in Mr* Wilbur's appeal
to that Court.
The case was briefed and argued before the First
Circuit, and the decision of the District Court was affirmed.
The State of Maine then petitioned this honorable
Court for a writ of certiorari.

During the pendency of tie

writ of certiorari, the case of State v. Lafferty was decided
by the Maine Law Court.
And State y. Lafferty is found at 309 A.2d 647,
And the case of State v, Lafferty expressly rejected the
right of either the First Circuit Court of Appeals or of the
Federal District Court to indicate and dictate to the State of
Maine what its law was, and that the State of Maine was proper
in deciding its law; and went on further to reaffirm the
principle of the concept of felonious homicide as announced
in the original Wilbur decision.
This Court granted petition for writ of certiorari,
summarily vacated the First Circuit decision, remanded the
case to the First Circuit Court in Boston for a consideration

9
in light of the ease of State v. Lafferty.
Upon reconsideration,, we finally were postured with
the position of the case,, as it is before this honorable Court
today.

Because on remand the First Circuit acceded to the fact

that the law of Maine recognized the concept of a single
generic offense within which the penalty category designations
of murder and manslaughter operated

„

not as elements of

criminality but as elements of factors bearing upon the
punishment of an individual who has had the determination made
beyond a reasonable doubt that he is a criminal»
However, the Court went on, despite this fact, the
case of In re Winship, as it is announced as a matter of
policy, should apply to this situation because of the potential
stigma which an individual faces when he is faced with the
difference between life imprisonment and twenty years for
manslaughter, or the possibility of probations and the
possibility of the man's loss of liberty is as great

in a

situation where you are determining punishment as it is when
you are making the decision in the first instance of
criminality.
The State respectfully suggests that that is an
unwarranted extension of the case of In re Winship, beyond
the facts and limitations to which it spoke.
The State further suggests that in the instant —
that there are cases in this Court which have indicated,

10
anu which are relied upon by the State of Maine in the
original WiIbur decision, that factors bearing upon
punishment have been treated differently.
ourselves, why?

And we ask

And as we go through the concept of

felonious homicide, 1 hope that I can explain that to the
Court,
It is critical that this Court understand what the
State of Maine is talking about when it talks about the
concept of a single generic offense, as it is- designated
in the common law of the State of Maine.
Essentially, the concept is:
offense:

there is one generic

an unlawful or felonious homicide.
And that this unlawful or felonious homicide

consists of degrees, and that these degrees consist of
murder and manslaughter.
into two degrees:

Manslaughter being again divided

common law manslaughter and voluntary

manslaughter.
And these degrees are nothing more, nor less,
than punishment categories which society has designated in
advance for actions which have certain results attributed
to them.
Now, what are the elements of felonious homicide?
The elements -QUESTION:

Do you have any other crime in Maine,

Mr. Arey, where this is also true?

11
MR. AREY:

The single generic concept, Your Honor?

Yes, I believe arguably in the situation of assault, that
assault is recognized as the underlying crime, and the
in
element of high/aggravation is recognized as only going to
in
punishment.
High/aggravation is not recognized as being a
criminal element.
Now, the State of Maine does require that the
in
element of high/aggravation be decided by a jury, and it
also requires that it be decided beyond a reasonable doubt,
I am not sure that that decision would come about
the same way, nor am I sure that the Ferris case, and that's
the case I'm referring to, is analogous to this one.
And why do I say that?
I say that because there is no middle ground in
assault by which we’re going to put any burden upon the
defendant to disprove or prove anything.
There is either simple assault, which is the criminal
act in itself, or the element of high in aggravation.
There is no middle ground by which it can drop
back into.

In other words, if, in the State of Maine, there

were only manslaughter and murder, you would have an analogous
situation, there would be no reason for a presumption, because
there is nothing to mitigate.
You're talking about either criminality or noncriminality, the minute you drop back to the lower designation.

12

Secondly# I would argue that on the facts of the
case, as we posture it# on felonious homicide# punishable
as murder# the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
Because# unlike the original common law presumption# which
required only the showing of an unlawful killing# and which
required the defendant to establish factors in excuse and
justification# as well as in palliation# the Maine
presumption does not arise until the State has proven an
intentional and an unlawful killing# and the definition of
"unlawful" is a killing which is not justified nor excused,,
The State bearing the burden upon the factors or criminality#
the defendant bearing the burden only upon the elements of
palliationNow# the elements of felonious homicide in the
first instance are that the victim is dead# and it must be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
Second# that the defendant killed the victim,
Third# that the killing was voluntary? that is#
that it was an act of his will#
And lastly# that the killing is unlawful? that is#
that it*s not justified nor excused.
Felonious homicide# punishable as murder# has
precisely the same four elements# with one additional? and
that is# that the killing# in addition to all these other
things# be intentional.

13
If that is the ease., the law of Maine says that
constitutes murder in the lav/, by definition.

The process by

which we do this is a presumption, so-called presumption of
malice.
Malice —~
QUESTION:

Mr. Arey, as I understand, one of your

opponent's contentions is that taking the Maine Court at its
word as to — and your explanation of how the criminal
statute is to be construed, and perhaps conceding, for the
sake of argument, that if that had taken place in this case
there would be no violation of Winship, that the trial judge
did charge the jury at that place, I guess page 40 of the
Appendix, where he says:
"The words 'malice aforethought' are most important,
because malice aforethought is an essential and indispensable
element of the crime of murder,"
Is that an inconsistency between the trial judge's
treatment of the case the Supreme Court of Maine's treatment?
MR. AREY:
would have to say yes.

To the extent that it says that, I
There is no question, Your Honor, but

what this is not the best charge for which —* that we wish to
be ~ I would point out, however, that when we talk about
crimes, even when we are known to be talking about degrees,
we sometimes use the word "crime".
For example, we speak about the crime of first-degree

14
murder, and yet we know that first-degree murder is nothing
more than a degree of a crime, to wit;

murder.

I would suggest that the language of the Court, if
read in context — the context within which the charge is
given, fairly supports the rationale of the Maine Lav; Court
as announced in Wilbur, Rollins, and Lafferfcy„
I would suggest that you do not start in the middle
of the charge, where the judge is talking about palliation
and ass-ming that the State has proven an intentional and
unlawful killing, but that you start at the beginning of the
charge and read it from beginning to end, given all of the
assumptions,, that must come from what is fairly read in the
charge,
I further would cite the fact that not only did
the Maine Law

Court say precisely that this is what they

had done, and, according to the language of Justice Webber
in the original WiIbur appeal, the quoted instruction was
predicated by the Court — and this is the instruction about
the use of the language to which Your Honor is referring?
language which is inconsistent, perhaps, with the position of
the Maine Lav; Court,
The quoted instruction was predicated by the Court
upon the assumption that the jury had first been satisfied —
and Your Honors will find this language on page 85 of the
printed Appendix? and I'm sorry I didn't direct your attention

15
to that —"that the jury had first been satisfied that the
State had proven a voluntary and an intentional killing
beynd a reasonable doubt."
That is the assumption that has been throughout this
case at the time that the judge is talking about mitigation.
It's not only the assumption of the Maine Lav; Court* it’s
the assumption of the Federal District Court in its opinion,
first opinion, and it's the decision of the First Circuit
after the remand of State v. Lafferty;

that the jury had

first been instructed that there was ah intentional and an
unlawful killing proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the
presumption arose.
Now, malice aforethought, as Maine views it, as I
have indicated, is nothing more than a term of art, having
no independent meaning of viability apart from the context
out of which it arose, and that is that felonious homicides
which are intentional shall have attributed to them the
highest degree of blame when it's for punishment purposes.
For, in the game, we call this policy the so-called presumption
of malice.
Now, what is voluntary manslaughter within the
concept of felonious homicide?
The punishment category of voluntary manslaughter
has precisely the same elements that murder does, an
intentional and unlawful killing? but the unlawful killing

16

must have been generated by heat of passion on. sudden,
adequate provocation.
It constitutes nothing more than a mitigating
factor to the charge of felonious homicide punishable as
murder.
To explain this further, in a charge for manslaughter,
the State would not necessarily bear the burden on the issue
of heat of passion

on sudden, adequate provocation,

QUESTION:

Well, I take it that it can’t be both,

that if there is premediated — if there is provocation, it
can’t be murder?
MR, AREY;

That's correct.

And the reason it

cannot be, Your Honor, is because —
QUESTION:

And so that — so that if there is

provocation, you cannot find a felonious — a murder, you
can’t find murder?
MR. AREY:
QUESTION;
that makes it murder.
MR. AREY:
QUESTION:
MR, AREY:

You cannot find a murder,
You cannot find whatever element it is
What is it?
That is the —
Malice aforethought.
— aspect of the maliciousness, yes.

To that extent, what we are talking is merely a matter of
mitigation.
to

We’re saying, as a matter of policy we’re going

say that this particular

crime will be punished.

How

17

will it be punished?

It will be punished by whatever the

penalty is for murder, but if you can convince us that,in spite
of the fact that it is intentional and in spite of the fact
that it’s unlawful, it should be punished as manslaughter,
by establishing —
QUESTION;

Well, let's assume you as a juryman,

sitting in the jury, and you thought the evidence on
provocation was absolutely evenly balanced, and you thought
that, Well, I've been instructed not to find this man guilty
of murder, except beyond a reasonable doubt, unless I’m
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt,,

But under these

instructions, apparently I can’t let this evenly balanced
evidence on provocation create a reasonable doubt in my mind,
because the defendant has the burden of proof to convince me
by a preponderance.
MR. AREY;

That's correct.

That’s precisely the

way it works.
QUESTION;

Well, —

MR. AREY;

And the reason we say that that is —

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that a fairly — isn’t

arguably that's an — isn't that an invasion of the reasonable
doubt standard?

Wouldn’t you say that if the evidence is

evenly balanced on provocation, but if it were proved beyond
— by a preponderance, that he wouldn't be guilty of murder?
Wouldn’t you say evenly balanced evidence would create

18

a reasonable — should create a reasonable doubt?
MR, AREY:

I would say no to that — I’d say yes,

evenly balanced evidence creates a reasonable doubt.

But

when you're talking within the concept of a punishment
category, instead of the concept as to whether or not the
verdict is going to be guilty or not guilty ■—
QUESTION:

No, but you still have to find him

guilty of murder,
MR, AREY:

And you do that quite apart from the

fact that he still has to fashion —

MR. AREY:

As far as double jeopardy provisions are

concerned, yes.
QUESTION;

MR. AREY:

If the

Depends upon what the evidence in the
if, in fact, the issue of voluntary

manslaughter is in the case, the verdict form would be:
guilty of murder? guilty of manslaughter? not guilty.
QUESTION:

What about this case?

Were there three

20

fontis submitted?
MR„ AREY:

That's correct:

murder? manslaughter?

not guilty.
Now, it must be remembered that again that we're
talking about an intention and an unlawful killing.

And

therefore the only branch of felonious homicide punishable
as manslaughter which was given to the jury was voluntary
manslaughter.

There does exist a felonious homicide which

is involuntary manslaughter, and that is essentially, speaking
in terms of what it takes to arrive at criminality, bears the
same elements as we have in discussing what a felonious
homicide is in the first instance.
If the State proves a mere unlawful homicide, and
does not carry the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
as to intent, then the verdict could very properly be guilty
of involuntary manslaughter.
QUESTION:

Which is simply an unlawful killing?

MR, AREY:

An unlawful killing.

QUESTION: Right.
MR, AREY:

Nothing more.

QUESTION: But the jury is never given a verdict
form that talks about felonious homicide, is it?
MR, AREY:
not.

No, it is not, Your Honor.

In any case.
No, it is

That is not to say the jury could not be, it is simply

to say that —

21

QUESTION:

It’s not the practice.

MR. AREY:

And I think the reason for it is because

it’s easier to talk to a jury and have them comprehend in
traditional terms, such as you and I talk about the crime,
perhaps, of first-degree murder, knowing full well that
murder is divided into first and second degree is really one
crime:

murder.
QUESTION:

But in those traditional terms, coming

down to that common-sense language, this charge put upon the
defendant the burden of proof.
MR. AREYs

We maintain that it did not.

We maintain

it put the burden of proof upon him to reduce the crime from
murder to manslaughter.

And we say that because the presence

or absence of heat of passion on sudden, adequate provocation
is irrelevant to an establishment of murder, either as a
punishment category — as a punishment category, and it's
also irrelevant to the establishment of a crime.
Whether heat of passion is present or absent in the
case has no bearing whatsoever on whether the crime is lawful
or unlawful in the first instance, and whether it will be
punished as murder or manslaughter in trie first instance when
the jury is viewing the evidence that has been presented by
the State's case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Arey, I could understand that better

if this were a bifurgated trial, but this is all one trial.

22

MR. AREY:
QUESTIONS

That's correct»
And the judge had to sort all of this

out»
MR. AREYs

That's correct, Your Honor.

Much the

same as they have to sort out the dimension of ~~
QUESTIONS

And in the sorting out, in a criminal

trial, there is a burden of preponderance of evidence»
MR* AREY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And that doesn't get you in any

MR* AREY:

We say no.

trouble?
And we say no, first of all,

because the case of In re Winship has been defined, as we
see it, as bearing upon punishment elements? and, second,
even if the same crimes could be said to accrue, at the
time that the jury is considering the question as to whether
or not to mitigate the homicide we are no longer dealing
with a man who is innocent in the eyes of the law, and who
is no longer shielded and protected by the presumption of
innocence, because we have a man whom the jury had to find,
by definition, committed an intentional and an unlawful
killing of another human being, in a State which has
defined those actions as constituting murder.
QUESTION:

You're saying, then, in effect, this

element is like the defense of insanity in heland v. Oregon,
where it ~

23
MR0 AREYs

Precisely,,

That the same analysis

could apply.
And that we're dealing with the matter of definition
of the State's internal law, as to what does or what does not
constitute a crime, and that the facts of this case, as it
is viewed by the Maine Law

Court, does not come out -» that

due process is not violated.
We are not saying that fairness doesn't apply,
we're not saying that soma of the same harms may not flow;
but we're saying you view due process differently when you're
dealing with a man who is guilty and who has been found to be
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, than you do a man with whom
you are taking in and trying to make a determination in the
first instance, that

that deals with the preponderance of the evidence is defined.
And when we tell the jury that he has to bear the burden
of the defense, in some States, of insanity, or the defense,
in some States, of what constitutes self-defense by a
preponderance? we have different burdens given on different
issues in jury trials all the time.

in fact finds him guilty of manslaughter* that the State* as
a matter of simple —* call it procedural fairness of due
process* without any reference to double jeopardy concepts*
will not allow the State to retry him for murder.
And that analysis would follow.

like this, finds him guilty of manslaughter.

Now, the issue has never been presented.
QUESTION:

Well, that would only be because they

found him innocent once of murder.
MR, AREY;

If it could not be.

Now, this is not a unique approach.

I would invite

the Court's attention to the statutory scheme of the States of
Oregon, Louisiana, the proposed Criminal Code in Michigan,
and,most notably, the State of New York, which, to our view,
treats the proposition exactly the same as we do.

They

define and take the concept of a single generic offense,
they define what they mean by murder and manslaughter, and
they say specifically, in talking about murder, that when a
person causes the death of another with the intent to cause
the death of another person, but he maintains that he does not
commit murder because he acted under the influence of
extreme emotional disturbance, this constitutes a mitigating
circumstance reducing murder to manslaughter in the first
degree.
However, this need not be proved by the prosecution,
initiated by the prosecution in any prosecution initiated
under the manslaughter provision.
QUESTION:
Maine.

Well, this is still different from

New York had Murder I, Murder II — you have about

four of them up there

23

HR. AREY;

I mean, I’m just citing that for the

proposition that the concept of felonious homicide and of
voluntary manslaughter as being only a mitigating factor,
it’s not unique.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

The other States were Oregon, Louisiana,

and proposed in Michigan; is that it?
MR. AREY:

I believe they are proposed in Michigan,

the ALI Model Penal Code; they’re all in my brief, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Right.
Well, don't almost -- don't a large

majority of the States, when you're talking not about mitiga­
tion but about self-defense, put the burden on the defendant
to prove justification in that sense?
MR. AREY:

A great number do, but Maine does not,

and that’s why we say we're consistent with the theory,
because self-defense goes to criminality.

We require the

State to negative.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

In all States it’s an affirmative

offense.
MR. AREY:

I'm not sure it's in most, but I know in

a great many, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
of guilt or innocence

Which just goes, again, to the question

29

MR. AREY:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

As they view it.

We don’t view it — vre don’t

view heat of passion on sudden provocation is going to guilt
or innocence? we do self-defense.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: But your point on that is that this Court
has approved,Oregon specifically, submitting to the jury two
different elements of the case, I won’t say of the crime,
of the case? two different standards:

one, beyond a reason­

able doubt? and one by preponderance of the evidence.
MR. AREY:

No, I can’t say that.

Oregon has not done that.

Leland

I wouldn't —

— the problem in Leiand

was that the defendant had to bear the burden beyond a
reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

Well, but they changed the statute right

after Leland.
MR. AREY:
QUESTION:

Subsequently, yes.
Yes,

The statute today in Oregon is

exactly the way you postulate the Maine law, they must treat
it as —
MR. AREY:

Right.

I?m not sure that their analysis

is the same, Your Honor? but clearly the burdens are.
QUESTION:

I suppose you — you really should, I

would think, say that Maine could also put the burden on the
prosecution to prove the absence of provocation by a preponder-

30

ancs of the evidence?
MR. AREY:

I suppose that under the theory the

State could do that.

Because the absence — presence or

absence of heat of passion is not an element of anything.
QUESTION:

Except for — just for penalty, you say?

MR. AREY:

For penalty.

QUESTION:

Yeah.

MR. AREY:

Unh-hunh.

Thank you-

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,, Mr. Arey.

Mr. Rubin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUBIN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Peter Rubin, and I represent the
respondent in this matter.
The first issue which I would like to discuss
relates to the history in Maine of this concept of
felonious homicide.
As Mr. Arey pointed out, the District Court did
reject that concept, and the First Circuit court of Appeals,
in its first decision, also rejected that concept," the
Maine Court then came forward with some subsequent decisions
in which it delineated the rationale behind that particular
concept

31
However, I would submit to this Court that the
concept lias no basis in the history of Maine, that the ~~ in
Maine, the crimes have always been murder and manslaughter»
The cases support it, the State refers to one case, State v,
Conley, which talks about, in terms of double jeopardy, the
underlying felony being the same»
But even in the context of that case, the Court
refers to the crime of murder and the crime of manslaughter,
the statutes refer to murder and manslaughter, they don111
refer to felonious homicide»

And although, perhaps ordinarily,

it is true that a federal court is bound to accept the law of
the State as it is enunciated by that State, I think that this
interpretation -- and perhaps one reason that the charge here
is so much in conflict with the concept of felonious
homicide is that the charge itself does reflect accurately
the law in Maine as it had been given by numerous judges in
the past; and then the Maine LawCourt came forward with
its new concept of felonious homicide, and that’s why the
conflicts appear, I believe, between the trial judge's charge
and the concepts in Laffertv and Rollins»
I think a review of the common law of other States
also will show that there is no other State which has ever
developed this concept of felonious homicide being the
underlying single crime at common law»
And that other States recognize the crime of murder

32

and manslaughter to be separate and distinct crimes.
QUESTION: Well, are you saying that the State of
Maine cannot construe its own law in that way?
MR. RUBlil*

I — certainly the State of Maine

*

could construe its law that way, I think, perhaps prospectively.
I’m not sure that in the context of this case, where, I
believe, historically the law of Maine was never -- never
utilized this concept of felonious homicide, that it would
be proper to do it in the context of this case and cases
prior to this case.
No, I don't take the position that the State of
Maine couldnft do it for the future.
I just don't think there's any support in the Maine
law for it*

I think that on that basis the First Circuit

ami Judge Gignoux were correct, First Circuit the first time
around, and Judge Gignoux in his opinion, that a federal
court should not be bound to accept the law of Maine in this
context, but should be free to examine the law itself and to
come to a conclusion that malice aforethought is an essential
element of the crime.
State v. Merry, in 1936, said that malice afore­
thought is an essential element, and that it's a fact.
But getting to —
QUESTION:

Well, the courts you won in below have

really repudiated that type of analysis now, haven't they?

33
MR. RUBIN;

Judge Oignoux never has, because he's

probably never been given the opportunity to,
QUESTION;
MR. RUBIN;

Never had a chance, did he I
The First Circuit, yes, but I don't

read anything in that second decision, which says;

we now

agree with the Maine court if we were free to interpret the
law.

I think the First Circuit came to the conclusion, after

the remand by this Court, that it should accept the Maine
law as enunciated, and go from there to the merits of the
issue.
But I don't read anything in the second First Circuit
decision, which says;

In re-reading Maine law, we now agree

that the Maine Court's interpretation is correct, if we were
free to interpret the law ourself,
QUESTION;

Do you read anything in the remand of

this Court?
MR. RUBIN;

Well, I took the position with the First

Circuit that all the remand said was reconsideration — I'm
sorry, further consideration.

It did not say reconsideration,

And I took the position that there was a distinction
there, that this Court was remanding it because an intervening
case had come down, and that it wanted to give the First
Circuit an opportunity to review its decision in light of
that intervening decision.
Obviously the First Circuit did not accept that

34
argument, and went on to decide the case on the merits
rather than sticking to its original decision, as to its
obligation to accept the lav; of Maine as enunciated by the
Maine Court.
The concept of malice aforethought itself, let's
assume for a moment there is — there was and

always has been

a concept of felonious homicide in Maine; there is absolutely
no support for the proposition that malice aforethought is
not a fact.

Even in State v. Conley, which is again the case,

the major case, on which the State relies, the Court said;
the State must affirmatively show malice aforethought.
It talks about it as if it were a fact.
So that if, even accepting the concept of
felonious homicide, malice aforethought itself is not a public
policy statement; never has been in Maine, it’s always been
a fact which the State — which has been one of the elements
for the State to prove, which they have traditionally proved
by a presumption.
I think there's ample evidence here, historically
in the law of Maine, which is directly inconsistent with this
concept.

I don't believe that a federal court should be

foreclosed from protecting the Federal Constitution in a
case, merely because a State Court comes up with an interpreta­
tion which is new and sudden.

And I recognize that this is

not identical to the Bouie case, in terms of the situation

35

there, in that there was prejudice to the defendant when he
went into the —* and sat down at the counter, he wasn't
dicin't have notice of the charges.
But, nevertheless, if, in this charge, the whole
trial proceeded on the basis of malice aforethought was an
essential element and was a fact, and then the Maine Court
came forward with its interpretation which removes that»
QUESTIONS

Not as a fact, Mr. Rubin, as an

essential element?
MR. RUBIN s
QUESTION j
MR. RUBIN:

Yes.
Yes.
Yes,

And the Maine Court then removes

that constitutional issue by the way it defines its law, and
then if this Court is foreclosed from — or has to accept
that interpretation, we have — or Mr, Wilbur has been
deprived of his right by fiat, almost, in terms of the
interpretation.
. QUESTION:

In response to a question from Mr,

Justice White, Mr, Arey said that if there was provocation
shown, then there could never be a murder.

At least that's the

way I understood him.
Now, does Maine law not recognize that there can be
what we call an over-reaction, that is, that the response to
the provocation was more than an unjustified, more than
necessary, and unjustified?

36

MR- RUBIN:

It has to be —» yes, I think it has to

be a reasonable response to the provocation.
QUESTION:

Suppose there was a provocation, and

the man provoked, who is on trial, is shown then to have
gone back into his house and got a shotgun and come outand
shot the provoking party dead?
Now, could that not be murder in Maine?
MR. RUBIN:

I believe, on the facts, that it could

QUESTION:

On that, the ones I’ve postulated?

be.

MR. RUBIN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

So the fact he wasn't — you may clear

that up later.

I would —

I certainly would think that that would not

be manslaughter any longer.
MR. R: UBIN:
QUESTION:
MR. RUBIN:
QUESTION:
MR. RUBIN:

Right.
And you agree?
I agree with that, yes.
Unh~hunhP
So that I’ve come to the conclusion

that, in reviewing Maine law, that this interpretation of
felonious homicide has never been the law of Maine, and
shouldn’t — this Court should not be bound.

And if this

Court isn’t bound, then I think it’s quite clear that the
trial judge did accurately state the law as it has always been
in Maine, that malice aforethought is an essential

37

element and is a fact, that is, factual in nature.
Really, otherwise there would have been no reason for
malice aforethought to ever have been developed, because the
court, in its charge, could have just said;

Once the State

has proved an intentional and unlawful killing, there arises
a presumption of murder.

You wouldn't have to get into this

concept of presumption of malice aforethought if it's not a
fact, if it's only a public policy statement.
QUESTION;

Mr, Rubin, on your thesis, do you think

the trial tactics would have been any different had the defense
known of the development of this felonious homicide concept?
MR. RUBIN;

I’m not sure.

respondent at the trial level.

I did not represent the

That's the item I tried to

think about, to make it analogous to the Bouie case, in terms
of actual prejudice to the defendant during the jcrial stage,
whereas similarly in Bouie there was prejudice to the
defendant when he walked into the restaurant.
I don't know,

I think perhaps it could, but I'm

not sure that I can exactly articulate the thought processes
that perhaps a defense attorney would go through in that
situation, in terms of the burden of proof.

Certainly if

the State had the burden of proving malice aforethought and
disproving the provocation, showing that there was no adequate
provocation, maybe defense counsel in that case would have
objected to the ...introduction of the statements, rather than

38

making a decision to rely on those statements as the method
of proving his defense„
QUESTION;

But the Court of Appeals finally got

around to accepting the lav/ of Maine the way the Supreme
Court of Maine interpreted it.
MR. RUBIN;

Again, I don't know if I'm making a

distinction without a difference; but I would submit that the
First Circuit merely said, We understand that we are
obligated to accept that lav/, but we do not necessarily
agree that that would be our interpretation of it if we were
free to do so*
QUESTION;

Well, we — but you're suggesting that

we should take a different view of the Maine law?
MR. RUBIN;
QUESTION;

Yes, that's right.
But neither the Supreme Court of Maine

nor the Court of Appeals —
MR« RUBIN;

No, I would suggest that the first

decision by the First Circuit Court of Appeals is the correct
one on this particular issue.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but that's different from

the Supreme Court of Maine.
MR„ RUBIN;
QUESTION;
MR» RUBIN;
QUESTION;

Yes, that's right.
About Maine lav/.
Yes, that's correct.
Well now, let's assume that the Maine --

39

that we accept the Maine law as the Supreme Court of Maine
ultimately found it to be, and that the Court of Appeals
recognized, then what fault do you find with the Court of
Appeals?
MR* RUBIN:

I find no fault with the Court of

Appeals on — if — excepting that.
However, I do think there's a —
QUESTION:
this, then:

Well, I don't — well, let me ask you

Suppose that Maine, in order to implement this

view of a single — of a single crime but with different
punishments for different degrees, had a separate penalty
trial,

And at the first trial it was simply an issue of

finding guilty or not of felonious homicide.
And then, with a separate jury, you tried the, what
degree it was, which really determined the punishment, and you
put the burden on the defendant to prove provocation by a
preonderance of the evidence,
Now, would you — would you object to that?
MR0 RUBIN:

Yes, I would.

And I think the

QUESTION:

Well then, I would think you would find

MR, RUBIN:

I believe the First Circuit said that

it —

that is impermissible, at least in the context of a single
trial, and I would expect the rationale of the First Circuit
would apply equally to a separate bifurgated trial on that

40

issue.

I believe «—
QUESTION:

And that takes away sons of the reason

for having bifurgated trials, doesn't it?
MR. RUBIN:
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand.
Well, if you must do it exactly the same

way on the second, on the penalty trial as you do in the
trial on the issue of guilt, then —
MR, RUBIN;

Well, certainly there are other

reasons, for instance, in the insanity area, to have a
bifurgated trial, other than merely the questions of burden
of proof.
In this context it seems to me that really gets
into the third issue on the merits in this case, as I see it,
which is:

does In re Winship, the rationale of In re Winshijs

apply to penalty categorizations?
If I could hold that in abeyance just for a minute,
I will respond to it,
I think there's an intermediate issue which is much
narrower, and which I think it's important for this Court to
consider.
And that is that if you review the charge in this
case, it is quite clear that the judge did not charge that
the jury had to prove an intentional and unlawful killing,
he only charged that the State must prove an unlawful killing,
and then malice aforethought is presumed.

41

And if you look at the Court’s definition of malice
aforethought, it is quite clear that that definition comprises
the concept of intentional.
So what the trial judge was saying to the jury was:
once the State proves an unlawful killing, which, in essence,
was that the defendant killed the victim, there arises a
presumption of malice aforethought, presumption of intent,
either a subjective intent to kill or the implied malice,
and then the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to dis­
prove the intent.
And I itfould refer to — it’s intexesting to note
that the jury did come back for further instructions, and at
that time the trial judge says;

All unlawful killings are

presumed to be with malice aforethought.
QUESTION:
MR. RUBIN:

What page is that?
It's page 61, Your Honor, and also on

page 62j he also says:
"Wien the jury is satisfied that the killing was an
unlawful killing, then the defendant in such a case has the
burden of satisfying the jury by a fair preponderance of the
evidence that the killing was not with malice aforethought,"
What did he mean by malice aforethought?
He meant that it was not intentional.
So that I think there’s an intermediate issue in
this case, which is much narrower than the third issue to

42
which Mr. Justice Uhifce referred# which is that under —
clearly under In re Winship the State has to prove that it
was intentional# and notwithstanding the fact that the law
of Maine requires the State to prove intent# in fact in this
case the judge erroneously charged the jury that malice
aforethought# i.e,# intent# was to be presumed until the
defendant came forward with evidence# by a preponderance of
the evidence, and disproved intent»
I think that's a fairly — at one point in the
beginning of the charge he says the State must prove intent. ■—
that the killing was intentional.
He then says# "And I will be back to that element
at a further time,"
I submit that in reading the charge as a whole# when
he came back to the element of intent# he is saying to the
jury that the State satisfies that burden by a presumption;
it satisfies its burden as to intent by the presumption of
malice aforethought,
QUESTION;

Of course# there's something to what

your opposing counsel says# that you don't simply seize one
instruction out of context# and the question is whether the
instruction as a whole fairly charged the jury.
MR. RUBIN:

And I wholeheartedly agree with that#

and I believe that in reviewing the charge there is only
one instance, right at the

very beginning# on page 20# I

43
believe, of the Appendix -- 19 and 20, where the Court — no,
I'm sorry.
Where the Court refers to proving that the State has
the obligation to prove intent, and then, from that point
onward, throughout the rest of the trial, he talks about
malice aforethought, and the presumption of malice aforethought,
defines malice aforethought to include intent —
QUESTION 2
MR. RUBIN:

Was exception taken?
I don’t believe that there was.

I'm sorry, it's pages 37 and 38, where the judge,
for the first time, refers to the element of intent; then on
the top of page 38 of the Appendix, he says, "I am going to
leave for now my suggestion

my language concerning what

the jury finding of what the defendant intended."
Then, I would submit, from that point on there was
never a reference again to the fact that the defendant — the
State must prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt.

It was

always in terras of the presumption of malice aforethought,
the presumption of intent, once the State had proved an
unlawfull killing; and the defendant must disprove intent.
So that I think even reading the charge in its
entirety, it's quite clear that the judge proceeded on the
basis that the State satisfies its burden of proof on intent
by a presumption of intent, after it has proven certain other
facts.

44
QUESTION;

Well, you're saying that it's conflicting,

that the charge says one thing at one point and another thing
at another point.
MR. RUBIN;

Well, I'm saying that it says ~ no, I

— well, yes, in one sense.

It says one thing at one point,

and then many other times it says the completely opposite
thing, so that —
QUESTION;

But isn't there some obligation on the

defendant to except, if he feels that way about the charge?
MR. RUBIN;

The Maine Law

Court accepted this

issue under Maine law, even though there was no -- I don't
believe there was an exception, because it presented a
serious issue, and under the Maine rules, the court itself
could recognize and decide an issue which it felt raised
serious constitutional questions, even though objection had
not been raised.

And I think it did so in this case, so I

would submit that perhaps — yes, there is an ordinary
obligation.
But the Maine rules provide for a consideration of
issues such as this, when they are -- the court considers
them to be very important; and they did so in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, and then too, isn't it true that

as of the time of this trial, there really wasn't much to
except, no basis on whichtt^o except?
MR. RUBIN;

That's correct also, Your Honor, yes.

45

I’d now like to move on to the third issue to which
Mr. Justice White referred, and I would submit that the
rationale, the underlying rationale of In re Winship applies
equally, even when you're considering factual matters which
go to punishment.
Clearly, if you accept the concept of felonious
homicide as enunciated by the Maine Court, then heat of
passion on sudden provocation, which relates to voluntary
manslaughter, is a fact which merely distinguishes punishment
categories.
Certainly, though, in the context of Winship, the
difference between life imprisonment and a maximum of twenty
years is quite substantialCertainly, also, the difference between a conviction
of murder and manslaughter in terms of the stigma that's
attached, is quite different.

I think in Lafferty the Maine

Court recognizes that murder has this high degree of blame­
worthiness, whereas manslaughter is mitigated and isn't
considered quite so blameworthy.
QUESTION:

Of course in Leiand v, Oregon, it's the

difference between guilty and not guilty.

Hew do you

distinguish Leiand?
MR. RUBIN:

Well, I think that gets into the third

consideration for the Court, which is whether or not there are
any counterbalancing factors which do not warrant shifting the

46

burden of proof, or putting the burden of proof on the State,
I would say that in this situation, when you’re
talking about heat of passion on sudden provocation, the
facts which prove the killing by the State, which the State
obviously has to prove, also go a long ways to resolving the
factual issue of heat of passion on sudden provocation.
It will show, perhaps, the difference in time, that between
the provocation, if there was some, and the killing, it will
show just how the killing occurred, perhaps.

These are

objective factors which I think are equally available to
the State as they are to the defendant.
Whereas, when you're talking about insanity, I
think you're much more severely limited to a state of mind
which is not shown by objective factors, it's shown by
subjective — more by subjective factors; perhaps it's more
difficult in that situation for the State to come up with
evidence, and that would be a reason, when you're balancing
the difficulties of proof in this situation, to say, to
distinguish the question of insanity from the question of —
present in this case —■ of heat of passion on sudden
provocation,
I think that clearly there is much evidence that's
equally available to the State as to the defendant,
Furthermore, I think the issue in Winship revolves
-

~mwjuwt-jwa

around whether or not, when the Court said at the beginning of

47
the, of its holding, that the State must prove every factor
essential to the crime, whether — when referring to crime,
the Court was really focusing in on the word "crime" or the
word, the facts that are essential to the over-all determination
of what the defendant is guilty of; whether it's, whether
you're talking about the crime or you're talking about the
punishment category.
Certainly, the facts of that case, in a strict
legal sense, were not criminal? they were a juvenile delinquency
case.
Furthermore, at the end of the case, there's a
reference and an adoption of language by Justice Fuld of the
New York Court, where he talked about proving the case against
the defendant, rather than the crime,
I think it's so important — one of the other under­
lying factors in Winship was the intent to minimize the chances
of error in a criminal trial, because of the fact that a
defendant could be — lose his liberty, and because of the
stigma that attaches to a defendant.
Certainly that has application, whether you're
talking about an element of the crime or whether you're
talking about something so important, even though it only
goes to punishment, which distinguishes between the ultimate
categorization of what the defendant will be punished for.
And here in this case the sole distinguishing factor between

49

assume there probably are some States which continue to place
the burden of proof on the defendant.
QUESTION: Do you think those rules are all invalidated by Uinship?
MR» RUBIIJ:

I think that certainly the question of

self-defense, a holding in this case that Winship is applicable
to the question of heat of passion on sudden provocation,
certainly would have applicability to tie rule of self-defense.
QUESTION:

But isn’t self-defense the type of thing,

just like you say insanity is, that the defendant is much
more capable of coming up with evidence of than the State?
MR, RUBIN:

No, because I think self-defense is

again a question where there are objective facts,

Because if

you — for instance, you may have the victim charging at the
defendant, and self-defense is not —
QUESTION: Well, the victim isn’t there to testify&
MR, RUBIN:

No, but if there are other witnesses.

So the State certainly has the burden of showing that the
defendant killed the victim, and, in the process of doing so,
would presumably show some of the facts that surround it,
I think that there is more apt to be objective
facts available on the question of self-defense and heat of
passion than there are when you're talking about the question
of insanity.
There may be cases, very truly, that the State has

50
no facts, which it could introduce? but I would submit that
probably in a great majority of cases the State has ample
evidence available to it, objective evidence, so that —
QUESTION;

Then, in your view, a defendant in every

criminal case is entitled to a charge from the trial judge
that unless the State has proved the absence of self-defense
beyond a reasonable doubt, he's entitled to a judgment of
acquittal?
MR„ RUBIN;

Only if there has been some evidence

introduced into the case which raises the issue of selfdefense .
Certainly, if there's no evidence in the case which
would raise that issue, no, I don’t think that the State has
to disprove it.
But once either the State or the defendant has
introduced some evidence of that, then I think that a decision,
applying Winship to the facts of this case, could very
easily —■
QUESTION;

Well, but then you don’t treat self-

defense exactly as you do the proof of the killing, where,
presumably, you don’t say that — you say the State has to
prove the evidence of the killing beyond a reasonable doubt,
not — if there’s some evidence of a killing, the State has
to go ahead and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR, RUBIN;

I think that's true,

But I believe that

51

the question of self-defense can very easily go to one of
the elements of the crime, in terms of the intent, the
unlawfulness of the killing.
One of the definitions of "unlawful" is that it's
not excusable or justifiable? and the definition, in Maine
anyway, of — I'm not sure I'm getting the right one — of
"justifiable", I guess it would be, is that it was done in
self-defense.
So that it seems to me that if that, the question of
self-defense does go to an element of the crime, i.e., that
the killing was unlawful, and once there5s some evidence into
the case of self-defense, there"s a question of whether or
not the killing was unlawful.

And it would seem to me that

it would be the obligation of the State, at that point, to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was unlawful, i.e,,
that it was not in self-defense.
So that I think that it could very well go strictly
to the element of the crime of unlawfulness of the killing.
I think, though, that the Court could avoid all those
issues, and avoid all the issues of the applicability of
Winship to in heat of passion on sudden provocation by
deciding this case on the intermediary or second issue which
I discussed, which is that the State, in this case, or the
trial judge in this case placed the burden of proof as to
intent on the defendant, to disprove intent once the State had

52
proved an unlawful killing.
And, as such, the — it seems to me that everybody
agrees that intent is an element of the crime of felonious
homicide? if that's the crime, it's an element of the crime
of murder? if murder is the crime? and I believe that the
defendant was required to disprove it.

I believe that that

would fall right squarely within Winship without any
extension of Winship or elaboration on it.
Thank you very much.
