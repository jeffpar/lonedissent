P ROCESDIKG S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

next in Bigelow against Virginia.
Mr. Wulf, you may proceed.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WULF, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WULF-:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on appeal from -the Virginia
Supreme Court following remand from this Court after the
decisions here in Doe v. Bolton and Roe v. Wade.
The question, the principal issue that the Court
has to decide, in broad terms, is whether the First Amendment,
which extends a special and explicit protection to the press,
allows a newspaper editor to be held criminally responsible
for publishing in his newspaper an advertisement for lawful
abortion services.
The facts are straightforward and were submitted by
agreement on stipulation.
The appellant, Mr. Bigelow, is — was a. director,
managing editor and responsible officer of a newspaper
called the Virginia Weekly.
QUESTION: Would it make any difference, Mr. Wulf,
to your, the position you've asserted in your brief if it
were explicitly an ad which solicited, actively solicited,

4
— you said this is just an announcement of services.

But

suppose they solicited and fixed prices and said credit terms
can foe arranged, an extensive treatment that's usually
associated with the solicitation of business.
Would it make any difference?
MR, WULP:

No, sir, I don't think it would make any

difference at all, for the purpose of this case.
QUESTIONS

Then, it follows from that —

MR. WOLF:

I think it's purely —

QUESTION;

— a State has no power to regulate the

advertising of professional services?
MR. WULF;

Well, these were not directly professional

services that were being regulated, in any case, these were
referral services.

This is not an advertisement by the

physician who was performing the abortion.

This was an

advertisement by an independent institution organization which
referred patients who came to them for the medical services.
QUESTION:
services, isn't it?
MR. V7ULF:

That's a conduit to the professional
Directly.
Sure, it is.

No, I don't say at all that the State cannot
regulate professional conduct — if that was your question.
I say that this was not that one.
Two, that it can't do it in this case because they
can't act against the press in this situation.

And three, they can't do it in this case because
the service that was to be performed was outside the
territorial power of the State, because the advertisement was
for a service, to be performed in New York, where Virginia has
no power over medical services.

And it was lawful? lawful

in Mew York.
As I say, the facts consisted, in this case, of
the advertisement, which is on page 4 of our brief, which
announces that abortions are legal in New York, that there
are no residency requirements there, that the agency will
provide placement service, quote, at low cost; and provides
a Haw York address and two New York phone numbers, where the
services can — where the information about the services can
be provided.
Defendant — appellant went to trial on those facts
and was convicted under Section 18.1-63 of the Code of
Virginia, which is also on pages 4 and 5 of our brief, which
states that:
"If any person by publication, lecture, advertise­
ment, or by the sale or circulation of any publication, or
in any other manner, encourage or prompt the procuring of
abortion or miacarriage he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."
He was convicted, fined $500; $350 of that was
suspended, on the condition that he not violate the statute
again.

6
The Virginia Supreme Court, in its decision, held
tliat the ad satisfied the terms of the statute because it
amounted to the encouraging or prompting of the procurement
it
of an abortion, and that/was not merely informational; and
then went on to say that in addition it was a commercial
advertisement offering services for a fee, relying on
Valentine v. Chrestensen and the Fourth Circuit decision in
Hunter vs. United States very generally, and went further and,
in particular, said that where the regulation of medical
health practice is concerned, the public should be free of
commercial practices and pressures.
And also finally held that the appellant had no
standing to raise the overbreadth argument, because appellant’s
conduct was in the commercial zone.
I shall address myself to the first two issues?
my co-counsel, Mr. Lowe, will address the ovarbreadth
argument in his portion of the argument.
QUESTION?

I suppose it follows from your position.

Mr. Wulf, that a State would be constitutionally prohibited
from telling newspapers they could not. advertise cigarettes?
MR. WULF:

Yes.

Yes.

I don't think that cigarette-

advertisers are immune from prohibitions on advertising.
I think newspapers are immune from such regulation.
QUESTION:

What about the Virginia newspaper carrying

an ad for a Maryland lottery, assuming the lottery is illegal

7
in Virginia but legal in Maryland?
MR. WULFs

I think that's lawful, too, because 1

don't think that that would be any different than the facts
in the case here.
Yes, Your Honor?
QUESTION: What do you do with Pittsburgh Press?
MR. WOLF:
QUESTION:

I disagree with it, Your Honor.
Well, you've got five people that are

still here, though, that joined it.

You've got to get at

least one of them, I take it.
MR. WULF:

Well, what I do with Pittsburgh Press

is to try to persuade at least one of the members of that
majority that this is not commercial speech that's involved
in my case,

tod I will deal with that, because I think it’s

pretty clearly not.
Before getting to the commercial speech question,
though, this statute — the first argument is that the
statute has to be struck down on its face and, as construed
in this case by the Virginia Supreme Court, because it does
not ban any of those categories of speech which this Court
has held are prohibitable, nor does it require the — nor
in this case was there any clear and present danger that any
evil which the State might prohibit would in fact be met.
We also argue that, as far as the Virginia Supreme
Court's medical health interest, assarted interest goes, that

8
in so far as that invites the application of the balancing
test here, that in the balance the appellant must prevail;
and we also argue that the statute is overbroad.
But arching over all of those arguments which I
make is the fact that the appellant here was a newspaper
editor convicted solely because of

words printed in his

publication, his newspaper.
And the specific protection extended to the press by
the First Amendment and the construction application of the
free press provision by this Court, at least since Grosjean
and on through Mills, New York Times v. Sullivan, Pentagon
Papers case and Tornillo, requires that the conviction in this
case be reversed and that the appellant not be allowed to be
convicted of a crime merely for printing material in his
newspaper.
And, indeed, even Pittsburgh Press assured us that the
First Amendment protection of the free press would not go so
far as to allow the appellant here to be convicted, because
Pittsburgh Press, the majority opinion distinguished between
the material involved there in the advertisements, and
advertisements which express a position on matters of social
policy, and also distinguish between the situation regarding
tha classified ads in the Pittsburgh Press case, and the
exercise — distinguishing it from the exercise of editorial
judgmental discretion in the content of advertisements.

9

And the Pittsburgh Press majority indeed promised,
and I quote, "that we reaffirm unequivocally the protection
afforded to editorial judgment and to the free expression of
views on these and other issues, however controversial."
This speech cannot be banned because it does not
fall into any of the standard categories which this Court has
allowed to be prohibited, namely, it's not obscene, it's
not libelous, nor does the advertisement constitute
fighting words.
Nor does it present, assuming that the

State may

prohibit this, prohibit abortions, this statute doe3 not
require that advertisements for abortions satisfy the clear
and present danger test.
And the fact is clear that the mere advertisement
allows ample time, and Mr. Justice Brandeis's words, "for a
full discussion of the question whether the woman, citizen
of Virginia, will in fact undergo the abortion."
But that rests — even that argument rests on the
dubious assumption that the State of Virginia has any power
at all to prohibit Virginia residents from being informed
of the availability of lawful abortions outside the State.
There is a District Court, three-judge District
Court case in Georgia, the Atlanta Cooperative News case,
cited in our brief, which in fact struck down what is the
federal equivalent of the Virginia statute in 1972, precisely

10

on the grounds which X advance here in our argument.
And another District Court case in Michigan that
supports the application of clear and present danger test to
abortion advertisements, in that case it was a ban oh billboard
advertisements of lawful abortions -— of abortions lawful in
New York«
As far as the regulation of the medical health field
interest of the State is concerned, it has no merit.

The

Virginia Supreme Court put forward the reason, describing its
interest in terms of assuring the pregnant citizens of
Virginia receive proper medical care.

But that, in this case,

although generally of course a fair interest of the State
where medical care is concerned, doesn’t apply here.
First, the First Amendment is involved in this case,
on behalf of the appellant, who is an editor of a newspaper,
and for the reasons I've already briefly canvassed, that is
one of the other ingredients that has to go into the balance
here.
There is the correlative First Amendment right of
readers of the newspapers to receive the information about the
availability of lawful abortions in New York and on a subject
which concesms the right, held by this Court to be fundamental,
to choose whether to

the right that women have to choose

whether or not to bear a child.
There is, in addition, the balance, in the

11
constitutionally protected right to travel across State
borders, there is a constitutionally protected right to privacy,
which I5ve alluded to? and there is, finally, the absence of
power in the State of Virginia at all to regulate the —
or in any State, the absence of power in any state to regulate
the conduct of its citizens out of State in ways that have no
contact with Virginia at all, except the fortuditous fact of
residency„
And I think in fact that the last reason is
virtually dispositive of this case, because it seems to me
unarguable that the States cannot forbid its citizens from
engaging in acts which are lawful outside the State.
And if it cannot forbid that, then it cannot forbid
the advertising of those activities.
QUESTION:

Do I correctly understand you to concede

that the State of Virginia or any State could forbid members
of the medical profession from advertising to perform any
kind of services, including abortion?
MR. WULF:

No, I didn't —

QUESTION:

Specifically abortion.

MR. WULF:

No, I didn't concede that, Your Honor.

I conceded there is great power in the State to regulate the
delivery of medical services.
QUESTION: Well, I thought you said they could forbid
the doctor, but they couldn't forbid the newspaper from taking

12

the ad.
MR. WULF:

I said more generally that, producers of

— I think what I said, at least what I intended to say was
that producers of goods and services could be prohibited from
advertising in some cases, which I don't have to define, that
there was a difference between prohibiting them from
advertising and prohibiting and penalising newspapers for
running the advertisements.
No, 1 did not — I did not concede that physicians
could be prohibited from advertising,
QUESTION: Soma of the members of the Court in the
Pittsburgh Press case thought that employers might bs prohibited
from specifying certain factors in employment ads, but that the
newspapers could not,

I think there was some concession

working in the. case.
MR. WULF:

Yes.

Yes.

No, I say in general I agree with the minority’s
view in Pittsburgh Press, about how to deal with that problem.
Prohibit the advertiser and not the newspaper.
Your question was specifically whether the States
could totally ban physicians from advertising their services.
QUESTION:
MR. WULF:

Yes.
The Court has never decided that.

It

has come close to it, perhaps, in the Head case, although that
~~ there were no First Amendment issues raised there.

13
I suppose I’m affected by our culture in thinking
perhaps that States can prohibit physicians from doing it,
because they do; but I don’t know that there has ever been a
serious First Amendment objection to that presented to this
Court or any other court.
QUESTION:

Isn't it true that the pressure is

usually put on the doctor, who does the advertising, not
on the paper for carrying it?
MR. WULF:

I beg your pardon?

QUESTION:

Isn't the usual pressure on the doctor

not to use the newspaper, rather than the newspaper publishing
it?
MR. WULF:

Well, sure; surely, I think the pressure

is the threat of being disbarred — unfrocked.

Yes.

Yes, and net on the newspaper, because I think in
practical terms doctors — I don’t recall ever seeing an
advertisement by a physician.for standard medical services.
QUESTION:
MR. WULF:
QUESTION:
MR. WULF;

Only there have been dental cases.
I’m sorry?
Thera have been dental cases.
Yes. There was a case, a similar case

here, of course upheld the power to prohibit that.

But again

there wasn’t any First Amendment issue raised there.
QUESTION;

That was the Head case, wasn't it?

least that was one case.

That was an oculist, I think.

At

14
MR, WULF:

That was an oculist, an optometrist.

QUESTION:
MR. WULF:

An optometrist perhaps.
Yes.

Yes.

Again no First Amendment claim —
QUESTION:

No, it wasn't raised.

MR. WULF:

— raised there.

There is, of course,

the related interesting case — not cited in our brief, but
in the brief of -the amicus curiae — the Virginia Consumer
Council case, brought by consumers rather than pharmacists,
attacking a prohibition against pharmacists advertising prices
of prescription drugs.
And I would think that perhaps the same constitutional
approach might successfully be taken with respect to advertising
by physicians, where it's a consumer issue.
Indeed, as to advertising by attorneys as well.
QUESTION: Well, you pointed out that this advertisement
related to abortions in New York, where they were perfectly
legal.
MR. WULF:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Suppose you had an advertisement for

narcotics in Virginia, the ad indicating that if you got in
touch with a certain individual he could direct you to a place
where narcotics could be obtained?
MR. WULF:

I think that could be prohibited.

I don't know that that’s speech, I think that's probably

Indeed,

15
criminal solicitation, assuming that the — particularly
narcotics was forbidden validly by the statutes of Virginia
or whatever State.
QUESTION: Would your ansx^er be the same if five
years ago, before tills Court’s decision on abortions, this
ad had related to abortions in Virginia, where, at that
time, they were illegal except under certain circumstances?
MR. WULFs

I don't think so, Your Honor, because

I think that ws must look not only at the question of whether
a particular service or goods is prohibited, but we also have
to look at the nature of the service or the goods.
And I think that, whereas an abortion, there was
even then — where it was then a very controversial issue,
there was very substantial constitutional argument to be
made out on behalf of the constitutional right of women
to have abortions, which vras of course the ultimate result
in tills Court; and that there were the very substantial
privacy claims on behalf of abortions, that it would be a
different case than the prohibition against adve-tisements
for narcotics or for an assassin, for example, things of
that sort.

Where there was not the counterveiling claims

available on behalf of the consumer of the particular banned
products.
QUESTION:

I thought you would say you'd make the

same argument based on imminence or danger, clear and present

16
clanger, just from an ad?
MR, WULF:

I wouldn't, Your Honor, where — no, I

didn’t say — X don't think X said -chat.

If I did I didn’t

intend to.
What I was saying was that —
QUESTION:

But I think you would make the same

arguments then,
MR, WULF:

Well, X might make it, but I would have

the additional argument -that it could be prohibited because it
was solicitation of a criminal offense.
But I don't

you5re asking me whether I would argue

•that if there were an advertisement for an assassin in a
newspaper, whether the —
QUESTION:

Yes, assassinations for hire

assassins

for hire, and a certain phone number.
MR, WULF:

Yes.

I might make it, but I wouldn't

make it very confidently.

Although I might argue that you

couldn’t proceed against the newspaper, that you would have to
proceed against the advertiser,

I might make that argument in

tliat case also.
Or, the question ~~ Mr. Lowe has his ten minutes due
right this minute.
We spell out in our brief why the advertisement
isn’t purely commercial, which is the words used in Valentine,
and I -would ask the Court to examine our reasons there in the

toriaf.

It surely is not a purely commercial advertisement

in the circumstances of the subject being advertised.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lowe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. LOWE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LOWE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Wulf has addressed the question of the First
Amendment protections involved here, and I will speak to the
issue of the overbreadth doctrine relating to First Amendment
issues on this advertisement that was placed here.
First, we certainly contend that this advertisement
was not pure commercial advertising, and I will address that
specifically in a moment.
We believe that there is ample evidence in the
record of editorial position being taken within the
advertisement, and that this is a part of the editorial
position of this paper.
The overbreadth question, of course, —
QUESTION:

Do newspaper ordinarily accept pay

for exercising their editorial function?

Are you suggesting

this paper accepts — will publish editorials for pay?
MR. LOWE:

Your Honor, I am most certainly

suggesting that in the context, particularly of an underground

/

in
newspaper,- where. it5s a hand-to-mouth operation, where a
do-lar here and there helps to keep the paper going, that they
do accept funds from whatever source, including accepting
advertisement which follows their editorial policy and
supports it, but which will provide some revenues.
fact this i3 the case here.

And in

And I think that one of the points

that has been raised is that this was a paid advertisement
for a commercial profit organization.
Not*, the fact that it wa3 paid has been disposed of
in New York Times v, Sullivan, that clearly does not remove the
First Amendment protection.
The fact that it was allegedly a profit-making
organization is only in the record because of the May-June
issue of the Virginia Weekly, which is in the record in kind,
relating to an acknowledgement by the. weekly staff, on page 5,
where it states, and I quote:

"The weekly collective has

since learned that this abortion agency, as well as a number
of other commercial groups, are charging women a fee for a
service which is done free by Women’s Liberation Planned
Parenthood."
In other words, this — -and this was submitted by
the Commonwealth, and does support factually the contention
that at the time this ad was inserted, at the time the offense
took place, the staff of this newspaper thought that they were
simply one more group of the radical left wing, or whoever it

19

ia that is urging the editorial policy of this newspaper,
which was supporting it and was doing a free service to
people that they genuinely felt needed abortion counseling.
Only later did they find that these abortion
advertisement services. Women’s Pavilion, was actually making
money on it.

And, to their great chagrin, they announced it

here with some anger.
I think that points out graphically that tills was
not a commercial advertisement in the sense that they knew
this was a profit-making venture, but rather it was a part
and extension of their editorial policy.
QUESTION;

If an editor is so enthusiastic about

a particular activity, he can promote that in his editorial
columns and in his news columns without calling on ads,
can’t he?
MR. LOWE:

He can and he does.

In fact, in the

May-June issixe, there is editorial writing.

And I might point

out, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Attorney General of Virginia
has stated that this is not an underground newspaper, or
at least that there’s nothing in the record.
I think within the limits of the English language
in the minds of men to create an underground newspaper, the
May-June 1971 issue is such a newspaper, if there are any at
all.

It has all the revolutionary rhetoric, all of the anti­

establishment epithets, the whole spectrum of underground

20

newspapership.
And in fact it has,, in many issues# and I believe in
this one also, little boxes of information:

If you want

abortion counseling# contact Diane at a certain number; or
that, type of information.
QUESTION: Are these newspapers in the record?
HR. LOWE: The ocher ones are not# no# Your Honor.
And one of the reasons — and again I have to state that in the
trial court# in the initial two trial courts, we have a twotier system in Virginia# of course — the issue of
commercialism was never raised by the Commonwealth, never
raised by the court and did not come up.
And there was no record made on it# other than these
two issues, idle issue which is in in whole and of course the
advertisement itself.
But, in fact# the editorial policy is supported by
advertisements# by notices which you might call advertisements#
but which are really insertions of little boxes of information#
where you go for certain types of information if you want it.
Now, in the context of the case of Broadrick v,
Oklahoma# which we have cited in our brief# this Court
discussed the overbreadth doctrine# but in fact I think
Broadrick really related more to a changing view where the
First Amendment activity was conduct rather than speech.
There, of course# the Court stated that conduct would

have to be real and substantial overbreadth, if it were
going to be overruled, rather than in pure speech where a
defendant or an appellant could assert hypothetical rights
of others in overturning a statute,
Now, the Attorney General in this case does not
really contest the idea that this might be overbroad if it
is a First Amendment issue, but merely contests the standing
and says there is no First Amendment issue here.
We have, of course, a pure speech question here.
I don't think there's much question -that we're not involved
in conduct; this is an advertisement, it’s a mere advocacy
in so far as it had its editorial content, and vre believe
that the, as I!ve mentioned before, the commercialism does
not really get in the way of the fact that it is pure speech.
We believe that the record itself shows that there
is an editorial policy which is supported by the advertise­
ment .
Now, in the context of Broadrick, we do have a
very substantial overbreadth here.

The hypothetical situations

we have outlined in our brief are very substantial.
Under the Virginia lav/ a doctor could not advise
his patient to have an abortion; a husband could not urge his
wife to have an abortion, if they had an unwanted pregnancy.
And an editorial in a newspaper could net urge abortions, to
cut down on population explosion.

Speeches, the Zero

22
Population Group, all of these groups would be illegal if
they so much as urged abortions.
This was a very burning social issue, particularly
before the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions, and it is
still a very burning issue.
Wow, the fact that there is a substantial chill on
First Amendment activity is pointed out by the Commonwealth
Exhibit No. 3 in the record, which is a Cavalier Daily,
University of Virginia newspaper, of 1970, in which there
was an article attributing to the Attorney general of Virginia
a warning to the Virginia Commonwealth University School
newspaper that they better not publish any abortion
advertisements, for abortion referrals»
I think that clearly when the Attorney General of
Virginia issues warnings, you must have chilling effects on
rights.
How, again following the Broadrick type of
analysis, we do not have here an ordinary criminal law.

This

is a law which is specifically designed arid aimed at abortion
advertisements and not illegal advertisements in general;
and in response to your — further response to your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, as to whether a State, for example, could
prohibit absolutely advertisements with rates listed in there,
I think that Pittsburgh Press teaches us that if the advertised
information is itself illegal, such as discriminatory sex

hiring, then that is a different category entirely, and if
the State, for example, prohibited physicians from advertising
rates or from posting rates or from telling people rates of
abortions, then I think clearly they could, then, under
Pittsburgh Press, find the advertisement to be an illegal
one.
Now, we disagree with Pittsburgh Press, but that I
think I have to concede if I concede that the Court is talking
about Pittsburgh Press.
In addition, I think the real danger there is that
the State would come up with a law that says it shall be
unlawful for a newspaper to publish an ad which is illegal,
and leave it up to the press to worry in advance of every
advertisement it put in whether it might violate some hiring
law, or some housing law, or some professional law, at the
risk of publishing at all, to where newspapers perhaps would
have to restrict greatly the type of ads that it took.
Again I would emphasize that abortions were legal
in Virginia when 'this case came down, when the charge was
made.
True, there were certain types of abortions which
were not legal, but there were legal abortions; so that this
was not an advertisement for an illegal activity even in
Virginia.
And following the Fifth Circuit case, which this

24
Court denied certiorari to, the Hiett v. United States, which
we have cited in our brief? in Hiett there was an anti-divorce
advertising statute, and the Fifth Circuit specifically said
it would be one thing if you prohibited advertisements of
divorces which were fraudulent or somehow illegei!, and in
this context if this were a well-drawn statute, narrowly
drawn to prohibit illegal abortions in 'Virginia, those which
were illegal under Roe v„ Wade —
QUESTIONs

What about a law that said doctors may not

advertise and newspapers may not carry their ads?
MR. LOWE:

I think that, first of all, Mr. Justice

White, that that is —
QUESTION:

That’s rather narrow, isn’t it?

That's

narrow enough, isn't it?
MR. LOWE:

not be prooer,

MR. LOWE:
QUESTIONS

All right.

Of course I —

May the press be forbidden to carry

MR. LOWE:

I would have to first answer somewhat

as Mr. Karpatkin had just answered, that I must answer that
in the context of the First Amendment as this Court has handed
it down through decisions.
And I believe that this Court's decision would say
that a State could do that.

I don't happen to personally

agree with it, but I believe that I would have to interpret
it in that context, given the decisions which this Court has
handed down.

Yes, I think the State could do that.

QUESTION:

Pittsburgh is the one that you would

I think I would center on Pittsburgh,

Because it’s the most recent, or the

most definitive?

No, I think it -- it's the most definitive

on point there, and again I have not — we have dealt in the

different than a professional, a doctor»

Here they’re

offering information, they5re offering perhaps a call to
conduit, but they’re offering directions, they're not
offering a specific service that’s performed on the patient.
QUESTION: Well, wasn't there some flavor of this
in the Virginia court's opinion in this case?
MR. LOWEs

Ohe I think that there was such a flavor,

QUESTION;

That doctors shouldn't advertise and

newspapers shouldn't carry their ads?
MR. LOWE:

I believe that that is part of the basis

of it, yes.
Mr. Chief Justice, I see that my time is up, and I
accordingly will have to sit down.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lacy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF D, PATRICK LACY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. LACY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The question in this case is not whether 18,1-63
denies a woman a right to have an abortion or interferes with,
the right of a woman to have an abortion.

Clearly it does not.

This is not an abortion case, it is a First Amendment
case.
It's important to note at the outset, however, that

27
the appellant does not contend that the statute was passed

,

with the intent to muzzle or curb the press or that the
statute has the effect of -threatening the financial viability
of the newspaper, or that the statute impairs in any
significant way the newspaper's ability to be published or
distributed, or that the statute infringes upon the layout
or organizational decisions of the newspaper.
Nor will the record support any such contentions.
The appellant was convicted for running in his
newspaper a purely commercial advertisement for a commercial
abortion referral agency.
The question in this case, then, is whether the
State is barred from prohibiting purely commercial advertisements for the sale of medical services.
Hie Supreme Court of Virginia found the advertise­
ment to be purely commercial.

Thi3 finding is amply supported

by a fair reading of the advertisement itself.
As stated by the Court below,the advertisement
constituted an active offer to perform a service.

It clearly

does not have the attributes, nor does it serve the vital
function of constitutionally protected speech.
The Court below correctly recognized the fact that
the ad clearly exceeded an informational status.
Where the appellant would have this Court extract
a few lines here and there from the advertisement, and be

23

blinded to the remainder, this cannot bs done.
The advertisement is a single document, contained
within four corners.

It appeals on page 3 of our brief.

Each line, each statement is geared to making the offer
sufficiently attractive to entice would-be purchasers of the
service.
QUESTION:

Do you find any evidence that the

statute was based on anything other than an assumption that
newspapers shouldn't advertise for services that were illegal?
MR. LACY:

No, sir, the underlying — as stated by

the Supreme Court of Virginia, and given the construction of
the statute, the underlying basis of the statute is that
there should be no advertising, commercial advertising of
medical services, there should be no commercial pressure or
practices through the use of commercial advertising.
The case, as it was decided by the Supreme Court of
Virginia, was not decided on the basis of whether abortion
was or was not illegal.
There * s a •—
QUESTION:

Do you think that it was just a

specialised application of a general prohibition against
advertising by doctors?
MR. LACY:

That certainly was the holding of the

Supreme Court of Virginia.

They didn't state it in those

words, but they said this is a prohibition against commercial

29

practices and pressures directed to free the medical health
field of commercialism.

And it cited Semlar vs. Dental

Examiners and Williamson vs. Lea Optical Company standing
for that proposition.
QUESTION;

Well, what business is it of Virginia

what happens in New York, medically?
MR. LACY;

Well, the business of it in Virginia,

obviously we cannot tell New York what its lav/s should be,
we cannot prosecute a woman who goes from Virginia to New
York — at that time — to obtain an abortion.

But we can

say that if you come to Virginia and you want to advertise
medical services in Virginia, we have the —
QUESTION; But they're not advertising medical
services in Virginia.
MR. LACY;
QUESTION;

They're advertising —
They're advertising medical services in

New York.
MR. LACY; But the advertisement is in Virginia.
The actual advertisement of medical services is in Virginia.
Although the medical services are going to be performed in
New York, the advertisement for those medical services is in
Virginia.
QUESTION:

How does that injure the Commonwealth of

MR. LACY;

Well, the same way an advertisement for

Virginia?

30

medical services that would be performed in Virginia could
harm a woman.
QUESTION:

Really?

MR. LACY:

That is, it

QUESTION;

You're talking about, quote, "medical

services in New York City" — or, rather, quote, "medical
services outside of the Commonwealth of Virginia", end quote.
That’s what you’re seeking to regulate.
MR, LACY:

The statute ■—

QUESTION:

You're seeking to prohibit it.

MR. LACY:

We’re not seeking to prohibit it.

This

statute is not a statute prohibiting abortion, no, sir.
QUESTION: Well, it’s prohibiting people from traveling
to New York to get one.
MR. LACY:

No, sir, it is not.

There is no —

QUESTION:

Well, what is it?

MR. LACY:

There is no statutory prohibition against

a woman leaving --QUESTION:

Well, what is it?

It’s just penalizing

the newspaper for publishing it?
MR. LACY:

No, sir, it’s a statute intended to keep

commercial, purely commercial advertising out of the medical
health field.

There would be no difference between this

statute if -—
QUESTION: Well, could you prohibit them from

31

advertising Alka-Seltzer?
MR. LACY:

Well, Alka-Seltzer, 1 don't think is

within that frame of medical health.

It's a non-prescription

QUESTION; Well, aspirin?
MR. LACY;

I think they could prohibit —

QUESTION;

Aspirin is slightly medical.

MR. LACY;
drugs.

I think they could prohibit prescription

Then you get into —
QUESTION;

Could they prohibit the advertising to

people of Virginia that you can buy aspirin in New York?
MR. LACY:
QUESTION:

No, sir, but not for the reason —
And the difference between that and this

case is just what?
MR. LACY:

The difference between that case and

this case is the fact that abortion is a medical procedure.
This Court has so held.

In Roe v. Wade and Dos v, Bolton,

this Cotirt held that an abortion is a medical procedure.
It struck down the statutes before it in Roe v. Wacle and Doe
v. Bolton precisely because the States in those particular
instances refused to recognize the fact that it was a medical
procedure.
And those cases extolled the virtues of profession­
alism. in the abortion decision in the first trimester.

Those

cases extolled the virtues of the physician-patient relation-

32
ship in the first trimester.
To strike this statute down would be totally
inconsistent with Roe v. Wade and Doe v, Bolton.

The purpose

of the statute is to promote professionalism, to keep, to
make sure that persons —
QUESTION;
MR. LACY;

Professionalism in Mew York?
Professionalism —■ anybody that wants

to render medical services to individuals in Virginia.
QUESTION:

In New York?

MR. LACY:

We have the right to make sure —

QUESTION;

To make sure that New York does its

medical job properly?
MR. LACY;

Make sure that anybody who comes down to

Virginia and advertises in 'Virginia.

A doctor from New York

who came down, who had come down and advertised —
QUESTION;
MR. LACY:
QUESTION;

Well, we don’t have this.
— and then goes back.
I don’t think you had anything to do with

this, if this was an advertisement that was mailed down to
them through the mail, you don't have a blame thing to do
with that, because that’s interstate commerce.
And they sent it down, they sent a check, and they
then published it.
And now how did that injure Virginia?
MR. LACY;

It’s not a question of — you can’t point

33

to the injury right there.
QUESTION:

Could you pass a statute to say that

no woman in Virginia can go to New York and get an abortion?
MR. LACY:

Absolutely not.

Absolutely not.
QUESTION:

They seem to put. it on the basis of

Virginia’s sovereign power to protect its citizens, did it
not?
MR. LACY:

Precisely, sir.

The police power to

protect the health and welfare of its citizens,

obviously,

it could not pass a statute saying that if you advertise
medical services in New York you can be convicted, that's
not the case at all.

The case is here, that a Virginia

doctor who advertises can be regulated, an out-of-State
doctor who advertises can be regulated, because the purpose
— the purpose is to make sure that the person who is
rendering the services is interested in the welfare of the
patient and not in financial gain.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lacy.

MR. LACY:

Yes, sir?

QUESTION:

Suppose the advertisement had advised

readers where they could get the best appendectomy in
Virginia.

Is there any statute in Virginia that would

proscribe that type of advertisement?
MR. LACY:

Am I to understand, Your Honor, from

34
the hypothetical, that it would he no profit, it’s just an
informational bulletin?
QUESTION?

So.

Let5 s assume it's a commercial ad.

You have pointed out that this case does not turn on whether
or not abortions are legal or illegal, you are emphasizing,
as I understand your argument, that Virginia has the right to
proscribe advertisements of medical services whether they are
legal or illegal.
I was just wondering, I don’t know, whether there
is a statute in Virginia

that would prevent somebody

advertising what is a perfectly normal legal service in
Virginia; and I'm not, talking about medical ethics at the
moment, I'm talking about (1) is there a statute, and, if
there is, would that statute withstand a First Amendment
attack?
MR. LACY;

Well, to answer your first question —

your second question first, Your Honor;
withstand.

I believe it would

I believe the State has a valid interest in

seeing that medical services, medical procedures are not
advertised, seeing that doctors don't say:

I perform or I

specialize in hemorrhoidectomies, or whatever it may be called,
and my price is thus-and-so; or something of this sort.
I think the State has a valid interest.
Secondly, there is a statute in Virginia, Mr. Justice
Powell, 18.1-417.2, if my memory serves me correctly, that

35

addresses itself: to medical referral agencies.
passed subsequent to this case even

It was

• well, it was passed

just recently.
But I do not believe it reaches directly the
advertising question.

But, of course/ advertising could, I

think, come within its penumbra there.
But to answer your second question firsts
definitely, that's the very point we're making.

Very

It's not

the question of whether the services are legal or illegal,
it's the fact that the State of Virginia, the General Assembly
of Virginia has the authority to determine that the
advertisement of medical services, the advertisements of
doctors' services, would be —
QUESTION:

I wonder how far this goes.

Suppose

this ad, instead of appearing in this newspaper published in
Virginia had appeared in the New York Times; could this
statute be applied to a distributor of the New York Times in
the State of Virginia?
MR. LACY:

Well, the statute itself only pertains

to the people who publish it or cause it to be published.
Now, whether it could be — I really don't think it would be
enforced as to the newsboy who might deliver it.
QUESTION:

Whether it's enforced or not, if the

statute reaches the distributor of the newspaper, it did,
could the -

Well# first of all, I don't think it

would apply to the distributor.

Yes, I'm wondering how far you carry your

power of the State argument.
MR. LACY: As to who can be prohibited?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LACY :

Well, we

QUESTION:

And the advertisement appeared not in

this paper but in the New York Times, and the New York Times,
I gather, is sold in Virginia, isn't it?
MR. LACY:
QUESTION:

It is sold in Virginia, yes, sir.
Could its distributor be

MR. LACY:

No, sir.,

QUESTION:

-— prosecuted under this?

MR. LACY:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Why not?

What's the difference between

the distributor of the New York Times and the publisher of
this little paper?
MR. LACY;

Well, on© big factual difference is that

tills person, the appellant in this particular case is the
person who actually published it.

The distributor, the poor

newsboy out on the corner.
QUESTION: Well, I'm assuming a statute which reached

37

also the distributor.
MR. LACY:

Oh* I'm sorry* sir.

Without any scienter or anything involved in —
QUESTION:

Nothing except what ~~ you had this

advertisement in the New York Times instead of in this paper
distributed in Virginia.
MR. LACY:

I think so.

I think so for this reason

QUESTION:

It could?

MR. LACY:

Yes, sir, I think so for this reason:

let’s assume that a doctor works up a handbill, setting
forth that he specializes in tonsillectomies, and he has
specials on every Wednesday and Friday in a certain hospital,
if you care to come by.

He prints them up, and he gives

them to people, friends of his, and says, How about handing
them out?
I think we could stop those people from handing
those things out.
QUESTION: And from putting the ad in the New York
Times?

Or in a newspaper.

Advertising in a newspaper.

MR. LACY:

Precisely, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Unh-hunts.

QUESTION: And do you think your statute 18.1-63,
as it existed, went that far?
MR. LACY:

No, sir.

Oh, no.

I’m not —

38
QUESTION;

Well, it says if any person, by publica­

tion, lecture, advertisement, or by the sale or circulation
of any publication.
Wouldn't that cover Mr, Justice Brennan's hypo­
thetical?
MR. LACY;

The sale or circulation, I think is the

economic activity, obviously it probably would in that particu­
lar instance. Had it —
QUESTION:

So the New York -Times is in trouble if

it carries these ads, isn’t it, in Virginia?
MR. LACY:

No, sir, it's not in trouble now.

This

Statute is no longer here; we3re talking about a statute that
has been effectively repealed by amendment over two and a half
years ago now, in essence.
We will never know.

The statute was in existence

from 1877, and this is the first —QUESTION;
does that mean?
MR. LACYs
was amended.

You say "effectively repealed", what
Has been repealed or -—
Well, no, sir, what I mean is that it

I said effectively repealed by amendment.

What I mean it's been changed, now to refer to abortions which
are intended to be performed in this State, which are illegal
in the State,
QUESTION:
MR. LACY:

I see.
And there are no illegal abortions in

39

Virginia.
QUESTION:

In other words, that would be pro­

cedures by other than a licensed physician; is that —
MR. LACY:
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir, I didn't — I’m sorry.
Well, if I understood your last

statement, it was limited to abortions that were illegal
in Virginia.
MR. LACY:

That’s the amended version of the

statute.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LACY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Well, that simply means that it’s one.
that’s performed by someone other than a physician, then.
MR. LACY:

Precisely.

We had — we have to follow

the decisions of this Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton.
QUESTION:

But they had nothing to do with

advertising of medical services, as I think Mr. Justice
Powell pointed out.
I think your friends agreed with that, by
implication.
MR. LACY:

I'm sorry?

QUESTION:

This is a case involving advertising,

not illegal conduct.
MR. LACY:

Precisely, but what the General Assembly

did, Your Honor, after this, after the appellant's conviction,

40

and there's nothing in. the record to show they did it with
regard to this case and net just — it was done.
a cold, hard fact that the statute was amended.

It's just
They just

changed the terms of the statute —
QUESTIONs Did you tell us that this was the first
prosecution under this statuta in modern times?
MR. LACY:

The best information I have —

the

best information I have is not only in modern times, but at
any time.
I think the statute was passed in 1878, if my memory
serves me correctly, and this has been the only -- I would
also draw the Court's attention to the fact that when Mr. Lowe
was up, he called the Court’s attention to an editorial on
abortion, which appeared in a subsequent issue of this very
paper published by the appellant.

And for which the appellant

was never arrested or convicted, of any sort.
The statute is not meant to address itself to
editorials.

It’s not meant to address itself to informational

bulletins.

It's meant

the Supreme Court of Virginia has

construed the statute to pertain only to commercial advertising
of these abortion services.
The advertisement does not express a position
whether a woman should bear a child, nor does it criticize
Virginia's abortion laws or their enforcement.
Now, the appellant doss contend that the mere running

of the advertisement constitutes an implicit editorial
opinion on the subject matter of the ad.

Such a. contention

however is totally lacking of support in

he record.

There is no evidence in this record that the
newspaper had a publicly acknowledged policy of accepting
certain advertisements and rejecting others.
To be sure, the concept that the mere running of an
advertisement constitutes an editorial endorsement of the
subject matter of the adf would undoubtedly appal the
editorial staffs of the nation's newspapers.
The fact that they ran an ad in their newspaper
and the mere running of that advertisement constitutes an
editorial opinion would undoubtedly appal them.
In short, the commercial advertising in this case
is not stripped of its commercial character in any wav,
shape, or form by editorial judgment.
The advertisement published by the appellant does
nothing more than pose a commercial transaction, and because
it is pure commercial speech, it is unprotected by the First
Amendment.
Unlike the commercial advertisement -—

excuse me,

unlike the non-commercial advertisement in New York Times vs.
Sullivan, this advertisement did not express opinion,
recite grievances, protest claimed abuses, or seek financial
support on behalf of any movement.

42
Pure commercial speech is neither intended to be,
nor does it have the effect of contributing to public debate.
Like the ad in question here, its intent and effect is simply
to propose a business transaction,,
Because we are dealing with pure commercial speech
unprotected by the First Amendment, we turn then to what is
the interest of the Commonwealth.
The interest of the Commonwealth, as I related
earlier to Mr. Justice Marshall, is that the Commonwealth
has a right, a valid interest in seeing that people who
render these important services are not motivated by pure
financial gain.

They do not get into unseemly cut-rate

actions. That they are interested in the welfare of the
patient.
If my reading of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton is
correct, this Court bottomed its decisions on the professional­
ism, on the professional judgment of the doctor in the first
trimester.
This statute, like Roe v. Wade and Doe v, Bolton,
vindicates that professional judgment.
The Supreme Court of Virginia found that this
statute was directed to commercial advertising, and was
directed to the purpose of keeping these commercial practices
and pressures out of this field.
I would call the attention of the Court to the

43
New York cases cited by the Supreme Court of Virginia in
its decisions, cases in which it was found that abortion
referral agencies, the for-profit abortion referral agencies
were doing substantial amount of advertising, were acting as
middlemen for doctors, were soliciting for and splitting
fees with doctors? and, most importantly, those cases
disclosed that these abortion referral agencies had no
follow-up procedures after abortions, that the women were
cast off after the service had been performed.
QUESTION:
in 1872?

How does that interpret an Act passed

As to what New York is doing now?
MR. LACY s

Well, the Supreme Court of Virginia

interpreted the Act,
QUESTION:

On the basis of what8s going on now,

compared to 1872.
MR. LACY:

It could have just as easily gone on

then, Your Honor, but, I submit — but the Supreme Court of
Virginia spoke.

We have no legislative history.

As you

may know, in Virginia very seldom do we have legislative
history.
QUESTION:

Neither you nor the Supreme Court of

Virginia know one single thing about what goes on in the
medical profession in the State of New York; am I correct?
MR. LACY:

We know from the New York cases that —

the Supreme Court of Virginia cited the New York cases.

QUESTION: That's all you know.

Because you don't

know how it — does the Commonwealth of Virginia take the
position that the. medical profession in New York is wrong
or —
ME. LACY:

NO, Sir,

QUESTION; You don't mean that, of course,
MR. LACY;

No, sir.

But the thing is •— the point is, Your Honor, that
we don’t have to wait.

We’re not saying that all physicians

in New York, Wisconsin, or Texas, we're not saying that at
all.
QUESTION;

You just decided in Virginia that to

. i

advertise in New York is wrong? that's the way you handle it.
MR. LACY;
QUESTION:
QUESTION :

Well,'we —
Just tell the people don’t go.
Mr. Lacy, do you have —■ is there before

us, in the briefs or anywhere, the new statute in Virginia?
The text, of it?
MR. LACY:

Yes, sir, very definitely.

Page 4 of

our brief, in the footnote, if Your Honor please, footnote 2
on page 4.
QUESTION: And you — oh, yes.

That is the effective

statute?
MR. LACY:

Yes,

QUESTION:

Nov/, is it your position that if there

45
was any overbreadth problem,, it's cured by that statute?
MR. LACY:

If the rationale — .if ----- our rationale

is underlying the overbreadth doctrine's chilling effect on
First Amendment rights, or maybe possibly selective enforce­
ment of the statute; if the statute is unenforcible, those
things cannot even exist.
QUESTION:

So you're saying that the present

statute merely prohibits advertisings about illegal
abortions?
MR, LACY:

Well, that's what the statute says.

QUESTION:

Well, the present statute wouldn't

reach this advertisement now.
MR. LACY:

Precisely.

Precisely.

Nor would it reach — nor would it reach anybody.
QUESTION:

It wouldn’t reach anything except

promoting what would be an illegal abortion,
MR. LACY:
QUESTION:

Precisely.
Well, there are still illegal abortions

aren't there, by people who aren't doctors, I suppose?
MR. LACY:

Oh, excuse me.

You’re precisely correct

There would be in instances.
QUESTION:

Tliere are still soma abortions that

are illegal, are there not?
MR. LACY:

I'm talking in terms — we had a

statute in Virginia almost identical to the Georgia statute

46
in Doe v. Bolton, as referring to that.
Because the overbreadth doctrine represents an
exception to the traditional rule of standing, that people
cannot raise the hypothetical cases of others, it should
be used only sparingly and as a last resort.

As 1 just

mentioned just then, application of the overbreadth
doctrine in this case would strike down a statute which is
unenforcible.
Secondly, I would like to point out that the appellant
has raised this morning the hypothetical cases of a doctor,
the hypothetical cases of a lecturer, and the hypothetical
cases of a woman and her husband, and of an editorial writer.
First of all, we knew that the appellant in this case
has written editorials, which have not been prosecuted.
But also the Supreme Court of Virginia expressly rejected
those hypothetical cases, it expressly rejected them.
Now, the appellant says it's dictum.
But, if the Court please, when the Supreme Court of
Virginia says we do not consider this statute to encompass
those cases, we read that to mean that's precisely what
they mean, that it does not encompass those cases.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Virginia has
authoritatively construed this statute to prohibit only
commercial advertising.

So, therefore, it would not even

reach a husband and wife discussing it, or a doctor and a

4.7

patient discussing it.
It's our position that an application of the over­
breadth doctrine in this case would simply result in a
windfall for the appellant.
QUESTION:

What do you think, the -- if the over­

breadth — let's assume the overbreadth argument is, for
all practical purposes, out of the case? what do you think
the issue is with respect to — that it’s left in this
case — this — there was a criminal prosecution?
MR. LACY;

'

Precisely, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And a conviction?
MR. LACY:
QUESTION:

A conviction, yes, sir.
For doing what?

For carrying an advertisement about an abortion
or an illegal abortion or a legal abortion?
MR. LACY:

For carrying an advertisement about a

medical service, to wit, abortion.

Abortion services.

Not illegal abortion services.
QUESTION:

And, in your view, it doesn't make any

difference whether legal or illegal?
MR. LACY:

Precisely — it's the same point about

dental services, and Semler vs. Dental Examiners, the service
were not legal or — you know, it could have been legal or
illegal, it was still proscribed.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather your whol point, Mr

48

Lacy, is that your Supreme Court has said this reaches only
commercial ads, this is a commercial ad, ergo the First
Amendment argument fails.
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

Yes, well, 'that —
Is that it?

That’s your argument?
MR. LACY;

Purely commercial, right.

QUESTION; ‘That may be right about the old statute,
but the conduct for which this defendant was convicted
wouldn’t violate this new statute?
MR. LACY;

No, sir, because it would have to *— well,

it would have to be *— you gave me one example.

soon when I said, you know, that there are no illegal
abortions in Virginia, and you corrected me.
QUESTION; Well, there are.
MR. LACY;

to the local —
QUESTION;

Is there some — there isn’t some

general statute that prevents doctors from advertising in -MR. LACY:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes, sir, there is.

Is there any general statute that says

newspapers can’t publish doctor's ads for their services?
MR. LACY:

Ho, but they could be subject to aiding

and abetting doctors who do publish ads —
QUESTION:

Well, then, why did you tell me carrying

49

an ad, that the ad that’s involved in this case wouldn't
be illegal in Virginia?
HR. LACY:

Oh -- this is not an ad by a doctor.

QUESTIONs

Well, it's an ad about a medical service,

MR. LACY;

Well, you asked me whether we had a

isn't it?

statute specifically drawn to doctors, and I'm —
QUESTION: Well, do you?
MR. LACY:

Do you or not?

Yes, sir, we do.

Specifically drawn

to doctors.
QUESTION:

If the doctor had his nurse, his

receptionist put the ad in the paper, just simply giving it
a name, such as this one —
MR. LACY;
QUESTION;
MR. LACY:

Could we prohibit —
— Reliable Medical Referral Service.
Could we prohibit that, sir, is that

your question?
QUESTION: Does the present statute of Virginia
prohibit that?

I'm not talking about this new statute

on advertising.

You said Virginia has a statute prohibiting

doctors from advertising medical services.
MR. LACY;

It's section 54-317.

paragraph 13, and says:
indirectly.

54-317, sub-

any doctor, either directly or

So, if it were proven that he told his nurse to

go do it, that’s precisely correct.
