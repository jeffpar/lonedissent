H£°ceedings

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

next in Cantrell against Forest City Publishing, No. 73-5520.
Mr. Sherman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY ALAN SHERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHERMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the

Court;
May I address myself as quickly as possible to the
nature of the case.

This is an invasion of privacy, and

may I respectfully suggest that it's an invasion of all four
types of privacy in one continuous event, or series of
events.
Although this is contradicted by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, I believe I will point out that they are in error,
and by the brief of my distinguished and. friendly opponent.
The facts in this case are briefly these:
The Silver Bridge, which was a span crossing the
Ohio River from Point Pleasant, West Virginia, to Kanauga,
Ohio, and owned by the State of West Virginia, collapsed on
December the 15th [sic], 1967, and 46 persons lost their
lives in that disaster.
One of the people that was a victim of the collapse
was Melvin Aaron Cantrell,

the deceased husband of Margaret

Mae Cantrell, the widow, who brings this action.

4
None of the seven children of the Cantrells was anywhere
near the collapse of the bridge, and was not involved in any
of the news story that naturally followed tJhat disaster.
The period of time between the collapse and the
publication of the story, feature article, not a news story,
was about eight months, just a little short of eight months.
A reporter of the Plain Dealer,.

Forest City

Publishing Company's paper, and a young photographer came to
the premises, which, incidentally,were seven miles off a
highway, off a main highway; they had to cross a quarter of
a mile of private land to get to the residence on the day
of their visit. They were not invited.

They were not — they

did not notify anyone that they were going to come onto the
premises.
They walked into the living room door*, w^en the
young fellow, 13 years old, saw a man walking across their
land, opened the door to look out to see, and they walked
right in.

This is the testimony of our plaintiff's witnesses.

That is, David Cantrell.
And the photographer, Conway, one of the defendants,
admittedly took fifty pictures.

Now, in an hour to an hour

and a half — now, he took more that didn't cone out, but
fifty that came out.

This is admitted.

So he was very busy taking pictures.
Eszterhas, the reporter, supposedly talked to the

5
older of the children in the house.

’[•'That he said, nobody

knows, because he never showed up at depositions, although
he was noticed twice; he was not at the trial, and did not
testify.
Conway testified that he did not ask any questions,
and he said the arrangements for him being in this private
residence, he presumed, were made by the city desk or the
reporter.

He had nothing to do with that.
So that we have nobody from the defense

testifying

as to the contents of the story, which was a feature story.
Admittedly, several pages of a Sunday supplement, magazine
section of the paper, with a little over 400,000 circulation.
Several of these photographs that were taken by
Conway on the visit xirere rather large, they are in Exhibit 2,
accompanied the article and showed the children, all in a very,
very pathetic light, all barefoot, all dirty, bedraggled,
all at home. The mother wasn't there.
The mother had not known that anyone was to come to
their premises; did not invite anybody; did not agree to any
interview of her children, aged two to sixteen at the time.
And they were told immediately, that is, the reporter and
photographer, as they walked into the living room, that "mother
wasn’t there; they didn't know when she would be back."
And the story was written as if on interviewing
Mrs. Cantrell, even describing her pathetic appearance, which

6

is completely fictionalized.
There were a great number of false statements in
the article.
Now, of course, it so aroused the community that
there was an article printed in a Dayton publication exposing
the fallacies, the falseness of the article that was printed
in the Plain Dealer.
QUESTION: Dayton, Ohio?
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
That was hardly the community.

MR, SHERMAN:

No, no — I beg your pardon.

It

was a Dayton paper, however, that wrote this —
QUESTION:

Story from West Virginia.

MR. SHERMAN:

— story about the community’s

reaction to the article.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. SHERMAN:

And that's in evidence, if Your Honor

please, in Volume 2.
So that the suit was brought as an invasion of
privacy action, and of course the issues presented briefly
are these — I set them forth in more detail in my brief;
but, first, when we went into trial, it was to make clear that
we were not trying a defamation or a libel suit, we were
trying an invasion of privacy, which, incidentally, involved
also a publication.

7
And Judge Krupansky made it very clear that it was
not only the false-light publication which was the basis of
this action, at page 99 of the Volume 1 of the Appendix, at
the top of the page — District Judge Krupansky said, "It is
the conduct of the parties prior to and at the time of the
incident that gives rise to the issues in this case."
QUESTION:

But he said that Time v. Hill elements

had to be established, didn't he?
MR. SHERMAN:

Your Honor, he was really, not so

sure as to what law he had to apply until —
QUESTION:

I know, but right following —

HR. SHERMAN:

But he did apply Time vs. Hill,

because —
QUESTION:

And there was no objection to that,

was there?
MR. SHERMAN:

As long as I got to the jury in that

court, I didn't object to anything.
QUESTION:

Yes. But you prevailed before the jury.

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, we —
All right.
— on special verdict, suggested by

Mr. Warder, I wasn't even present —
QUESTION:

I mean but even under the Time v. Hill

test, you prevailed on the evidence?
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes.

Yes, reckless disregard as to the

3

truth or falsity, as the only basis for our recovery, and the
jury found that it was so.
Now, Your Honor, that’s very important —in the
first place, I wanted to tell you the issues first and then
come back, if you don't mind, Mr. Justice Brennan.
The second issue is this —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sherman, before you do, may I ask -

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

There was a directed verdict as to a

number of the minor plaintiffs.
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes.

QUESTION: And why did they go out and one remain in
MR. SHERMAN: Well, Your Honor, Judge Krupansky
found that, as a matter of law, these children were too
young to know whether they were hurt, whether they had any
inter-personal feelings about the invasion of their privacy,
and therefore, since we —
QUESTION:

Well, he left William in, didn't he?

MR. SHERMAN: William, David William was thirteen
at the time, and he testified how he was hurt, Your Honor.
The others were too young to testify.

So he was actually a

witness in the case, and I think a critical witness.
QUESTION: Well, Lolita Sue was 17.
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes, she was 17, and he just — he

was — he left them out and I was afraid to argue and carry

9
that point up because, on the question of damages, it would
be strictly a real serious legal question in our minds ; I
discussed it with Margaret Cantrell.

We decided to let well

enough alone, without clouding the record, the issue, on
any other aspect of the case.
We were not allowed to go to the jury on punitive
damages, which I felt we might well go, on the basis of the
trespass preceding the publication.
However, in view of the judge's strong feelings,
that Me\ir York Times vs. Sullivan, and all the other cases that
came down since then, that once it's published we're running
into freedom of the press, as expanded by the Supreme Court's
decisions, and there was — he was wary of allowing us to
go into any punitive damages.
So we were confined to actual damages, and the jury
verdict was $60,000; 45 for the mother, 15 for the boy.
The next issue that I5m raising is;

in such a case

where we are really basing our concept of the case on the
Supreme Court decisions, especially in Katz vs. United States,
where it says we have the evolving law of privacy at the
State level, and we're on a diversity basis; aren't we
entitled to a Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, to make
a determination of the issues of fact?

And that's one of the

issues that I raise on the appeal.
And the last one — and this one, I think, is

10

devastating when the Sixth Circuit says that when there is a
conflict between the right of privacy admittedly, and the
freedom of the press? the right of privacy must give way to
freedom of the press.

Because right of privacy isn’t

mentioned in the Constitution, and freedom of the press is.
This is the wording of the Court.
So that that's another issue that I raise, and I
believe, in all fairness to my opponent, I should tell you
the issues as the respondents have raised them.
First of all, in their brief in opposition to the
grant of certiorari, they raise one question: Should
certiorari be granted in an action for invasion of privacy
based upon the publication of an article concerning a matter
of public interest, where the loiter courts correctly applied
the constitutional standard in accordance with the controlling
cases of this Court, and where the lower courts found no
evidence of known falsity or reckless disregard of the truth?
Now, that’s not exactly what the court found. The
court found no malice, period.

The jury found that there was

a reckless disregard.
But then, in their brief, they say, very simply:
Does the First Amendment protect publication of a non-defamatory,
newsworthy article from a claim for false-light invasion of
privacy, absent proof of calculated falsehood?
Now, Your Honors, I’ll point out that no one decided

11
that there was any newsworthy article here,

Although the

Sixth Circuit points out that the difficulty for courts in
deciding what's newsworthy, Sciying that the editors, the
publishers, should primarily be the judges as to what's
newsworthy.
But the editors and publishers in this case, not
one word was spoken in evidence, or anywhere in pleadings,
that this was newsworthy.

It wasn’t newsworthy, there was

no news article, no news event.

They admitted it was a

creative feature article written by a smart young writer, who
made good copy; and that's all there was to it.
QUESTION: Well, that concept is almost selfdefining, isn't it?
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

If it's printed in the newspaper, some

editor has decided that it's newsworthy, —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:
that judgment.

May I respectfully —

— and it's not for the courts to review

It's a self-defining concept, isn't it?

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice —
If it's in the newspaper, it's news­

worthy, because —
MR. SHERMAN:

I was a newspaperman and an editor

for sixteen years, and may I respectfully say, sir, that that
is just r.ot the way they look at it.

12

Feature articles are conrolefcely one category of
publication, with all the protection of the First Amendment
rights to feature articles, and the creative literature.
There’s no question about that.
But, newsworthy?

No, Your Honor.

There is a

definition of news and there's a definition of newsworthiness,
and the Supreme Court of the United States has made that
definition very clear, as I pointed out in my Reply Brief,
if Your Honor ple<ise, in the classical — in a case that was
decided here between International News Service and Associated
Press, there was a definition:

news belongs to the public;

news is not the property of anyone.

And feature articles are

protected, literary writings are protected, copyright laws,
and all the other things that go along with it.
We have a very definite distinction in the field of
journalism, as between editorials, news, feature articles,
so that — and entertainment and other features of a
publication.
Now, Your Honor, I'm not saying that the broad —
that the broad basic constitutional right does not apply to
all; but, as far as news is concerned, I think that the
primary purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the
public's right to know events, and shape their thinkings and
judgments in accordance with the events that shape the nev/s,
so to speak,

13
Now, with —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sherman, —

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

— did you file a Reply Brief?

MR. SIIERMAN:
a — I*m sorry.

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Yes, Your Honor.

Oh, yes.

Yes, there's

There's a reply brief, Mr. Justice Biackmun.

QUESTION:

Filed on September 6.

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Immediately —
Thank you.

I don't have one, but I'll

have to get it.
MR. SHERMAN:

— about a week after I got their

brief.
QUESTION:

While you're stopped, supposing here for

a moment —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor?

— is there not some kind of a — or is

there some kind of a public interest in the consequences of a
great tragedy of this kind, 46 people killed, that might in
turn have an impact on the Legislatures, Governors, Mayors,
everyone else, to see that old bridges are replaced, for
example, or kept in repair so that these tragedies aren't
repeated?
Is that in here somewhere?
MR. SHERMAN:
should be.

Ideally.

Mr. Chief Justice, ideally it certainly
Practically, I'm the attorney also that's

14
trying the Silver Bridge death cases in the State of West
Virginia; and they’ve got a new bridge.

But that's over the

hill, and now they're just on regular business.

They don't —

these things are not remembered.
The rights, if any, must be intact in the judicial
process, or they're forgotten until another tragedy occurs.
QUESTION:

Would they not remember perhaps a little

more if someone writes about them?
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. SHERMAN:
fellows did, no.

If they write this way —
Dramatizes them.
— if they write the way these

Because they're calling them "hill billies",

people that had "nothing to live for anyway"; "they had
wives and whildren, but that's all they had."

That’s quotes

from the article.
"Hill billies bury their dead; the hill folk bury
their dead."

To a Cleveland audience, to a metropolitan

audience outside the hills of West Virginia, no, Your Honor,
I respectfully say that the history of these things show that
interest is personal and interest is in the curiosity of the
satisfying of one's own reading appetites, but not in
doing anything to protect the poor folk that were the
victims of a tragedy of this sort.
We have to depend on justice, not history, to
correct its own errors, and especially when we have to look

15
to political changes in order to effect such history.

We

can't wait for the democratic process to enlighten all our
populace that serves on juries, for example.
But, Your Honor, I'm sorry, I went perhaps beyond,
in my philosophical statement, your question.
Nothing of that sort specifically was brought into
the case as such, except in the Answer, where they did
raise public interest as one of the privilege bases for
printing.
Okay.

Now, there's no question that there could be

a legitimate public interest in the truth.

And I i^ould

subscribe to that, of course.
There might be a very, very definite way of actually

q
interviewing Mrs. Cantrell.
The interesting thing in this case is that the
reporter, who never showed up to ex jlain why he went there
uninvited, and a new theory was interjected on the trial,
this absent report, all of a sudden, becomes a man who is
free-lancing.

Now, there was no affirmative defense that

there was no employment.

There was an admission that there

was an employment in the Answer.
Then, all of a sudden, on trial he's free-lancing,
to separate the publication and the publisher from the illegiti­
mate trespass of the reporter.
QUESTION:

Well, that defense, if you can call it

16
that, didn't seem to have much impact

on the jury, so it

isn't a factor in the case.
HR. SHERMAN:

Because, Your Honor — because, Your

Honor, I happen to have takenttie deposition of Conway, who
clearly — well, he talked one way in court, but the
deposition just destroyed his credibility, because he said
he got authority from the City Desk, and he was working as -~
he wag taking pictures, not for Eszterhas but as a photographer
for the Plain Dealer.

That's what he was doing there.

And, therefore, Your Honor, credibility was an
important element in the determination of the jury.

And

that's, of course, I think, fact-finding as to — is for the
jury, as my very strong and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sherman, if I don't interrupt you —

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Of course, Your Honor.

— would you help me with something?

In the Court of Appeals opinion, at page 125 —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Notwithstanding what we saw earlier as

to the instructions that were given at page 99, —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

— there is this statement at tile bottom

of the page:
"In the present case the District Judge made a
finding that there was no evidence to support the claim that

17
an

invasion of privacy was done maliciously 'within the legal

definition of that term'."
And over on the next page:
"Having correctly determined that there was no
evidence of known falsity or reckless disregard of the truth,
the District Court should have granted the motion for a
directed verdict as to all defendants."
Now, where — I can’t seem to find in this record —
where is there any District Court finding that there was no
evidence?
MR. SHERMAN: There was a District Court denial of
our right to punitive damages on the basis of no malice, and
I'll — that is —
QUESTION: Why type of malice?

New York Times malice

or State —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Or was that State malice?

State malice.

MR. SHERMAN:

No, it didn't say.

QUESTION: Well, I think it makes a lot of difference.
QUESTION:

I should think your case here would be,

Mr. Sherman, that the trial court instructed the jury precisely
in terms of Time vs. Hill, and that the jury brought in its
verdict, and that's the end of the matter.
QUESTION:

Unless there was no evidence to support

18

a finding of Time v. Hill malice.
MR. SHERMAN:

Except, in Time vs. Hill, you had

only the publication, had no invasion, no trespass, no —
nothing like that —
QUESTION:

That's not my point, Mr. Sherman.

The point is, I just don't know where there is any finding
that there was no evidence.

And it seems —

QUESTION: Well, where is it in the record?
MR. SHERMAN:

No, he doesn't make such a finding.

QUESTION: Well, where is it in the record that he
denied your right to punitive damages?

Where is that?

I don't find it in the printed record, it must be
in the transcript.
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it's in the printed record.

It’s there, but there's no finding.

I found it a minute ago.
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Page 117.

MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, I —

A hundred and —

Let me ask you.

In your State, doesn't

punitive damages depend upon the traditional kind of malice
of ill will and intent to do wrong, do harm?

Isn't that

what malice usually is meant in libel cases?
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's exactly it.

In other words, whether it does harm or not is —

19
QUESTION: Where there's ill will —
MR. SIIERMAN:

Unless you can prove that there was

some motivation to do harm, no malice, as such.
QUESTION: Well, that's different, that's a different
kind of malice than New York Times kind of malice.
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And you have to prove New York — or Time

v. Hill, same thing, kind of malice even to get a compensatory
judgment, irrespective of punitive damages.
MR. SHERMAN:

And you got one.

Yes.

QUESTION: And he refused to set it aside, which
certainly implies that he thought there was evidence enough
to support the finding that he told the jury they must find.
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes.

QUESTION: And yet the Court of Appeals says that he
made a finding there was no evidence.
MR. SHERMAN: Well, there is no such finding, and
may I, at this point —
QUESTION:

Well, it's in quotation marks on page 125.

QUESTION:

That’s right.

QUESTION:
MR. SHERMAN:

I can't find it, either.
"Within the legal definition of that

term,"
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SHERMAN: Well now, —

20
QUESTIONi

~ is gone, I guess.

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, that's about the extent of

the quotation, "within the legal definition of that term."
QUESTION:

No.

He imputes at the top of page 126,

"Having correctly determined that there was no evidence of
known falsity or reckless disregard of the truth," ~ that's
the Time v. Hill standard —
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— "the District Court should have

granted the motion for a directed verdict."
MR. SHERMAN:

It made no such finding, Your Honor.

There's absolutely no such finding.
QUESTION: Well, I can't find it,
QUESTION: Well, maybe your colleague will tell us
where it is.
MR. SHERMAN:

And I'm sorry they can’t — I vras

sure I had it, everything cataloged, but I just can't find
it quickly enough.
r

QUESTION:

I suppose the transcript is here, isn't

it?
MR. SHERMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, this is — the total

trial is in Volume 1.
QUESTION: There's no other — these are the entire
proceedings?
MR. SHERMAN:

Except Volume 2 is exhibits; that’s

21

right.

This is —
QUESTION:

You mean this is all the evidence?

MR, SHERMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And there's —■ you'll find that this was a case that
was right down to the bone, it was -- there was no fat on it,
it simply had, we had to avoid arguments on what —* ttfhen the
Judge said, this is it, this is how I'm letting it go to the
jury, and only this. All right.

What am I going to do?

Anyway, Your Honors, I feel that there is one thing
that really has to be aired, and that is this:
The second issue that is raised by the opponent,
that Mrs. Cantrell, in effect, waived the trespass. There is
no such thing.

She was asked a specific question by my

distinguished friend here, at page 35 of the record.

In

cross-examination he said — the Sixth Circuit says that she
said these things, but it isn't, it's in the question, it's
a double question.

And this is a woman remote in the hills of

West Virginia, without any education:
"So isn't it fair to say, Mrs. Cantrell, that you
objected to the Plain Dealer article not because of the
publicity but because of what it said?
"Answer:

Yes, sir."

Now, which question is she saying "yes, sir" to?
There is only one — the publicity is the article, and what is
says is "the article", "yes, sir"; and they say because she —

22

he implies that she didn’t object to the publicity as
distinguished from the article, that therefore that was somehow
a waiver of the trespass.
And the Sixth Circuit says specifically that the men
might have been guilty of a trespass, but the case went to the
jury only as a flase-light trespass on the publication.
Did not.

Page 102-103, as well as 99, which I pointed out

to Your Honors before.
The case went to the jury as a total package, all
the evidence went in on the basis of the intrusion of these
young men into the home, without any explanation or justifica­
tion.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sherman, —

MR. SHERMAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

QUESTION: —this was a diversity case.
MR. SHERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Were you proceeding under Oahio law

privacy or West Virginia law?
MR. SHERMAN:

Both. They are the same.

QUESTION: They're the same?
MR. SHERMAN:

It's admitted that they were the same.

And, of course, now, there is at this point it was
— especially since Your Honors have decided the Gertz case,
and I studied that in its totality, because I am learning, as
everybody else is learning in the United States, and

23
especially your lower court judges, as to where we go from
here on some of these cases, which the common law has always
made rather solid.
I want you to know that we got exactly and only
what was granted as compensatory award for pain and suffering.
Here we have three years after the event, Mrs. Cantrell is
•v

in the courtroom and she's asked about the effect on the
children. They come home crying and so forth. And she's
embarrassed everywhere she turns,
go on?"

"And how long did that

"It still goes on", three years later.
Now, 400-and-some thousand publication of a newspaper

and these resn-jtc.: people — y

wt get any more private than

the Gallipolis hills of West Virginia, if Your Honors please
— and here's a family that had enough tragedy in its life,
and she has problems raising seven children, and she's doing
well, very, very proud lady, a lady, and working as a
waitress in a restaurant and doing well; asking nothing of
anybody, refusing welfare and so forth.
And while she's away at work, her family is intruded
upon and is exposed, hung up to dry, because some young
enterprising, creative fiction writer decided to make a
microcosm out of the Cantrell family's experience for all the
world to believe that all of the families had the same result.
Now, may I, in closing, just call Your Honors'
attention to the very important case, Stanford vs. State of

24
Texas, where the Supreme Court points out very definitely the
history of how we got personal liberty, before the
Constitution, how we got privacy before the Constitution,
and the two English cases, which wiped out writs of assistance
and similar warrants that gave broad authority to the agents
to go into anybody's home and search for evidence and to
deny any privacy to anybody; and here we are with a Sixth
Circuit Court, in 1974, cowed by what the law had. become
under the confusion following New York Times vs. Sullivan,
and I respectfully say that it was only that,granting a
license to private reporter-s and photographers — the
second word is even more ominous than the first — to do the
same tiling that was wiped out 200 years ago, before we
became a nation, and let them have any access without any
answerability in damages in a court of law in the United
States.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Mr. Warder.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SMITH WARDER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WARDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I think the passage that the Court wants is found on
page 60 of the Appendix, where the trial court finds -there

25
has been no evidence in support of the charges that the
invasion of privacy, if in fact an invasion of privacy occurred,
was done maliciously within the legal definition of that term.
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Now, where is that?
Page 60 of the Appendix.
Yes. All right.

That's at the close of the plaintiffs' case?
MR. WARDER:

At the close of the plaintiffs' case,

yes, sir, and that's where the court threw out the claim of
punitive or exemplary damages, because of the absence of
malice under the Time, Inc, standard, but erroneously sent
it to the jury on compensatory damages.
QUESTION:

Well now, he said under the — he said

lack of malice, what do you suppose he — you say he meant
the Time, Inc. —
MR. WARDER:

In the context, if you read the record,

this is the only malice we were discussing.

We never even

discussed the common law standard of malice.
All we discussed was Time, Inc.
QUESTION:

Well, the common law standard of malice

has always had to do with the punitive damages; that's what
this was about:

punitive damages. And that depends, as I

understand it, under West Virginia and Ohio lav;, upon proving
conventional malice, i.e., ill will.

Which is quite a

different thing from New York Times or Time v. Hill kind of

26

malice,
MR. WARDER:

You Honor, if you will compare the

court's definition of malice in the charge he gave the jury
with this statement, I think it will become apparent that he
was not talking common-law malice.
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

He just wasn’t.
Why, then, did it go to the jury?
He mistakenly -thought —
Why did he require you to go on with

your defense?
MR, WARDER: I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
QUESTION:
your defense?

Why did he require you to go on with

Because if this were related to Time v. Hill

malice, that’s the end of the case.
MR. WARDER:

It should have been, and that’s what

the court —
QUESTION: But I don’t see any objection to going
on with the defense.

You went on with it.

MR. WARDER: We moved for a directed verdict, and
we renewed it.
QUESTION:

I know, but he said, "With that ruling,

gentlemen, Mr. Warder, you may proceed with your defense."
And you did.
Now, if you’re right in what you tell us is the

27
interpretation of that, you should have —
MR. WARDER:

I should have —

QUESTION: Furthermore, after trial he denied your
— he granted in part your motion NOV and denied it in part.
MR. WARDER:

No.

He overruled it in its entirety,

Your Honor.
Remember, Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

All right, then that's even more clear

that he thought there was enough evidence for the jury.
And this was after the verdict.
MR. WARDER:

On compensatory damages.

Of course he

did.
QUESTION:

Well, but that depended on so-called

New York Times malice.
MR. WARDER: But this is the confusion that was in
the trial court’s mind.
Now, if I can get back to Your Honor’s question.
I am a trial advocate, I am faced ifith the proposition that
the court says, I am going to the jury on compensatory
damages? I submit, it is most dangerous not to put in a defense,
because I'm going to that jury anyway.
QUESTION: Do you think the District Court may have
foreseen our Gertz case before it was handed down?
MR. WARDER:
fairness.

I don’t think so, Your Honor, in all

28

QUESTION:
to do with this case?
MR. WARDER:

Nell, does Gertz really have anything
This is a privacy case.
Tangentially yes, Your Honor, as I

shall come to.
Remember, despite the protestations of my learned
opponent, this is a false-light privacy case.

On page 35

of the record, the petitioner admitted that she was not
offended by the existence of publicity but by its nature.
And if you i^ill read the question preceding the excerpt
which my opponent read, this becomes perfectly clear.
Now, —
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:

Well, that’s parsing it pretty finely.
No, there are —

QUESTION: When you’re talking to a lay person who
is not well educated, and I submit that it's pretty difficult
for me to understand your —
MR. WARDER:

Well, let's approach it from the other

way, Your Honor.
It's not a commercial exploitation case.

It is not

a case of the disclosure of embarrassing private facts.
Neither is it a case of an unwanted intrusion.
Now, there are only four types of privacy, and this
is all that remains.

It has to be.

For that matter, commercial exoloitation, as I
understand it, was laid to rest by this Court's decision in

29

the Pittsburgh Press case.
But this is a privacy case which, had it bean brought
as a libel case, would not have gone to the jury, because it
is not libelous, per se, and there is no proof of special
damages as is required in a libel case.
Now, Your Honor, I would like to compare the state
of the law in right of privacy and in libel and slander.
In a right of privacy case, truth is not a defense.

In a

libel case, it is.
At common law, in a privacy case, it is a complete
defense at common law, if the matter is one of public
interest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Warder, I-notice..in the'complaints, in a

action for malicious and defamatory libel. What happened to that
aspect of it?
MR. WARDER:

That was dismissed and abandoned.

It just never went to the jury', it was tried on a simple
privacy theory and counsel admitted that in his opening
argument.
QUESTION:

Was there an amended complaint, or is

that the only complaint?
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:
MR, WARDER:
QUESTION:

That’s the only one.
I see.
Now, —
But everybody seems to agree that the

30

complaint was, perhaps implicitly amended to —
HR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Right.
And I notice, incidentally, in the

complaint, that on punitive damages, the allegation is, "The
said publication ... maliciously, falsely, wantonly and
scandalously portrays plaintiffs’ decedent" — that’s a
different kind of malice, isn’t it, than Time v. Hill malice?
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
What page is that on?

QUESTION; That's at page 4, paragraph six.
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:

Thank you.
Now, in a libel case, in the light of

Gerta, I have some doubts and so does the bar at large and
the courts as to whether being a matter of public interest
is any longer a defense, when we axe discussing private
persons.
Nov;, let's see where this diagrams out.

As to

privacy and libel, if there is a matter of public interest
involved, and if it be true, plaintiff can recover under either
of these; but if it is not a matter of public interest, and
if it is false, if it's de famatory, then you can recover in
libel.

If it is nondefamatory, then you can still recover

in a privacy action.
Nov;, somehow here it seems to me that in this
narrow context, freedom of press just does not exist.

31

Going further, if it's a matter of public interest
and false, you can recover in libel, but as I understand
Gertz, only if it is defamatory on its face.
And, finally, if it's not a matter of public interest,
and if it’s true, you can still recover in a privacy action.
Now, there is something wrong here, and it seems to
me the touchstone, if I am sitting at the editor's desk, if
there is something in this article that rings the alarm that
tells me this article has a propensity to offend, then perhaps
I publish at my peril, and I think I should.
But if I read an article that rings no alarm, that
carries with it no warning, if thereafter some jury is to tell
me I owe damages, I have become liable without fault.
QUESTION:

But you postulated a subjective test

there, some things would ring a bell with some editors and
other editors wouldn't hear any bell at all.
MR. WARDER:
better hear the bell.

Well, if the alarm is there, he had
I think it's an objective test.

It

would be tested in the court by the judge that reads it and
tells him that there’s an alarm in it.
That you can't get away from.
QUESTION:

Then that's what you meant when you said

the editor reads it at his peril.
HR. WARDER:

Right.

QUESTION: Because he's got to wait and see what a

32
jury and what ultimately this Court does here.
MR. WARDER:

No.

No, I said he publishes at his

peril, if the alarm is there. And I do not think it would be
a defense to the paper if the editor was deaf and couldn't
hear the alarm.
I think, so long as the alarm is there, then
perhaps liability is warranted.

But absent an alarm, when

you are publishing, you read this article, you do not see
any propensity to defame or to offend, and you publish, and
after the fact you get caught.

This is hardly consistent —

QUESTION: Well, are you suggesting, then, that
even a right of privacy consistent with the opinion in Time v„
Hill violates the First Amendment?
MR. WARDER:

I am contending that in a false-light

case, — well, what I'm really coming to, Your Honor, is I
think the Constitution prohibits a false-light privacy case,
per se.
QUESTION: That itfould certainly go further than
Time v. Hill, wouldn't it?
MR. WARDER:

It would go a little further.

Here —
QUESTION;
MR. WARDER:

It would overrule Time v. Hill.
No.

Time v. Hill was under — was

decided under a special statute, whereunder truth was a
defense.

You see, I'm dealing with common-lav/ privacy, where

33

truth is not a defense.
QUESTION; Well, that’s not very clear to me about
your argument.

As you’re parsing this down, I’m not clear

whether you're talking about the common law of defamation —
ii

•

MR. WARDER:
QUESTION;

I'm talking common law.
— or are you talking about the

constitutional limitations upon the common law of defamation?
MR. WARDER:

I'm talking the common law of

defamation and the constitutional limitations, as I understand
them, on the cause of action for libel.
And, Your Honor, to develop the thought:

as I

understand it, in a false-light privacy case, there is never
an alarm bell.

If there were, it would be a cause of action

for libel.
This

whole concept of a false~light privacy is a

concept designed by the common law courts to give a plaintiff
a cause of action who could not win his case if it vrare
brought in libel.
QUESTION:

Well, let me — I think you're talking —

we might be talking about two different things, without
distinguishing them.
You're suggesting that perhaps an editor wouldn't
have an alarm bell in terms of whether this might embarrass
a person, but if you — there's another aspect to it:

whether

or not there might be an alarm bell as to whether the statement

34

is false.
Now, it might — there might be an alarm bell if
it's false, but no alarm bell that it would make any difference
even if it was.
MR. WARDER:

I want to make myself clear, Your

Honor, —
QUESTION:

Now, Time v. Hill said there had to be

— at least recklessness with respect to truth or falsity.
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Right.
Now, this jury found, as it had to under

its instruction, that there was at least recklessness in
terms of truth or falsity.
MR. WARDER: Right.
QUESTION:

Now, you could be absolutely right in

what you've said so far, but you haven’t gotten to whether or
not there's an alarm bell with respect to truths or falsity.
MR. WARDER:
only.

I am speaking as to truth or falsity

I do not think it matters whether there is an alarm

bell as to the propensity to offend.

If an editor never

published anything offensive, he would have a namby-pamby
paper.
I submit that the original Watergate story was
offensive to many, and still is to some, but wouldn't it have
been horrible had it not been published?
You have to publish offensive things.

35
No, I'm speaking strictly of whether it's —
QUESTION: Well, I don’t understand how you
distinguish between libel and false-light cases in terms of
the constitutional protection.
MR. WARDER:
Honor.

I am trying to make it the same, Your

I'm not distinguishing in terms of their constitutional

protection, I am distinguishing in terms of the old common lav;.
This is — what I am urging is that the constitu­
tional protection in a false-light privacy case should be as
broad as it is in a libel case.
QUESTIONs

Didn't you get the protection of those

kinds of instructions here?
MR. WARDER:
jury licked us.

Your Honor, of course I did.

And the

And the Sixth Circuit held that there was

no evidence upon v/hich the jury could base their verdict.
QUESTION:

I think if the Court of Appeals was

right, you win; but what if they're wrong about the evidence?
MR. WARDER: That is a question, you review the
record, if the evidence is there —
QUESTION: Do you lose, then?
MR. WARDER:

I think we would, Your Honor; but I

don't think the evidence is there.
A reckless disregard or knowledge of the falsity.
QUESTION:

Are you saying, Mr. Warder, that we

abandon the issue in this case as to whether or not there was

36

sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict?
MR. WARDER:

I think that we have to come to it.

We think it's a matter of law that under the Time-Hill
standard there was no evidence of malice.
QUESTION:

We think that —

You do not object to the instruction

given by the court, as I understand it.
MR. WARDER:

No.

We took no exception to the

instructions.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. WARDER:

That is correct.

You know, Your Honor, in reflecting on this matter,
there's another anomaly here.

Somehow the law is wrong.

If Eszterhas had stood on the street corner in Gallipolis
and said orally what he wrote for the paper, there would have
been no cause of action for privacy, and no cause of action
for slander.

The words are not slanderous, per se, there are

no special damages.
Also there would have been no cause of action
because Eszterhas is protected by the freedom of speech clause
of the First Amendment.
Somehow you put it in the paper, you remember that
the newspaper has two defenses:

one, freedom of speech;

second, its own special freedom of the press.
And to get an opposite result from the printed word
rather than the oral statement, to me makes no sense.

37
Now, I submit, I don’t have all the answers.
QUESTION:

A good many decisions in this Court,

I think, that properly analyzed, to indicate that the two
guarantees are not cognate, that you might very well get a
different result under a Free Press case than you would under
a Free Speech case.
And isn’t it true that invasion of privacy
generally is something to which only media, publishers, are
liable.
MR. WARDER:

Generally, yes.

QUESTION: 3y definition.

Because it involves

publicizing rather than merely an individual speaking.
MR. WARDER:

Professor Heckman even makes that

flat statement in his book on Torts.
I don't think it's any longer true.

I have in

mind the electronic devices which might now constitute an
invasion of privacy, but which are beyond the scope of this
case, in which we need not consider.
QUESTION:

Mr. Warder, I have problem with "this

material was gained by trespass".
MR. WARDER:

Is that right?

No, Your Honor, there —

QUESTION: There wasn't a trespass?
MR. WARDER:

No, Your Honor, had this been an

action in trespass, there wouldn't have been the jurisdictional
malice for a diversity case.

38

Thesegentlemen were seen approaching here.
QUESTION: Well, was this a State trespass case?
MR. WARDER:

There's no trespass case at all.

A man is not a trespasser until it is made known to him that
his presence is unwanted.

Up till that point he is at worst

a licensee.
These people are no more trespassers than the book
salesman —
QUESTION:

How can he be a licensee when the

mother wasn't there?
MR. WARDER:

The children were there. They were

in charge.
QUESTION: Well,, they couldn't give license.
MR. WARDER:

They were in charge of the property,

of course they could.
QUESTION:

They couldn't give — children could

give license?
MR, WARDER:
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:
MR. WARDER:

Certainly, Your Honor.
The two-year-old?
No, but the seventeen-year-old.
Is that the law of Kentucky?
Well, I don't know what the law of

Kentucky is, but I know that if I leave my children with a
seventeen-year-old baby sitter, she's in charge of that house
till I get back.

39

QUESTION: And she can give license?
MR. WARDER:

I would think so. She is the possessor

of the real estate until my return.
QUESTION:

But I thought the child said deliberately

"Mother is not here".
MR. WARDER:

He said "mother was not here",, yes, but

QUESTION:

Well, I interpret that as saying the

whole license is not here.
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

No, they didn’t say. Don’t come in.
The licensor is not here.

MR. WARDER: They didn’t say, Don’t come in.
They didn't say, Please get off the property.
QUESTION: They just said —- well, why did they say,
Mdther was not here?
MR. WARDER:

Because they asked for her, the

reporters asked for Mrs. Cantrell.
QUESTION: And you don't think that was a trespass?
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Not at all.
Isn’t a case sounding in violation of

privacy in the nature of trespass concept?
MR. WARDER:

Oh, of the old common —

QUESTION:

Trespass on the person's privacy, as

those —
MR. WARDER:

The old common lav? concept, of course;

I was thinking of terms of trespass to real property, and I

40
think that’s what has been argued to Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Her whole complaint here is that the

— your client trespassed on her privacy and her household
and her family and her tragedy.

That's the essence of it,

isn't it?
MR. WARDER:

No.

Her complaint is that we

published false statements concerning her. That’s her complaint,
QUESTION: Well, you trespassed and then published —
MR. WARDER:
QUESTION:

Right.
— the results of what you found.

Or thought you found.
MR. WARDER:

Well, Your Honors, I see I have some

time left, but I have nothing to add to these remarks.
And if there are no further questions, I'll waive nr/ right
to proceed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Sherman, you have used all your time.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY ALAN SHERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHERMAN:

Mr. Justice, if Your Honor please,

I want to point out that my friend — ray friend's statement
on the alarm situation:
the falsity.

First of all, there is no denial of

Our plaintiffs' case went down the line to

prove that the articles, thct the contents of the article were
false, absolutely false.

41
There was no denial of anything that we said was
false.
Secondly, on page 102 and 103 —
QUESTION: Well, does that become important after the
jury has returned a verdict under these instructions?
MR. SHERMAN:

No, Your Honor, as far as I’m

concerned? but when he argued that, somehow or other, that
if they publish a story, the editor can't be held for falsity.
They didn't deny it was false.
Secondly, that the — Judge Krupansky told the jury
that if they found — they had to find that the trespass and
ths actions of Conx^ay and Eszterhas were x^ithin the scope of
their employment, that they were sent there, rather than they
did it on their own.

At page 102 and 103.

So I wanted to just point that out, Your Honor.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:45 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
