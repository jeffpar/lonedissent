ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Courts
This case is her© on the government's petition for
certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit*
Tins sol© question presented by the petition was
whether the admiralty rule applied in mutual*»fault collision
cases of dividing damages equally should be replaced by a
rule apportioning damages in proportion to fault.
The facts necessary to provide a context for con­
sideration of this question are few, and are rather fully
set forth in the government*s brief on the merits.
Briefly, on the evening of December 23rd, 1968,
respondent’s tanker, -the MARY A. WHALEN, left Constable Hook,
New Jersey, in. heavy winds and high seas bound for Island Park,
Ne York, with a load of fuel oil.
During the course of th® passage, the vessel became
stranded to the west of an. inoperative breakwater light on a
promontory known as Rode away Point.

4
After a trial that lasted for several days, the
district court held that although the Coast Guard had been at
fault in failing to complete repairs on tha breakwater light,
earlier, the fault of the captain and crew of the MARY A,
WHALEN, respondent*s vessel, had been far more egregious»
Specifically, the court found that the stranding was
due 25 percent to the negligence of tha Coast Guard, to the
fault of the Coast Guard, and 75 percent to the negligence of
the captain and crew of the WHALEN,
Despite 'the fact that the court found the respective
faults of -tii© parties to have been disparate, and after having
observed that while a division of damages in proportion to
fault might be more equitable in this case, the court,
nevertheless, applied the divided damages rule, or ordered that
a. damage hearing be held in which the divided damages rule
would be applied,
Tha Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that so far
as negligence was concerned, the vessel's claim that it was
not at fault borders on the frivolous and, with respect to
remedy, that it was powerless to divide tha damages other
than equally, even though it. recognized the fore® of the
argument that in a case of this sort an unequal proportional
division of damages would fc© more equitable,
Although respondent chose not to file a crosspetition in this case, it nonetheless sought, in its opposition
e

(

5
to the government’s petition for certiorari, and in its brief
on the merits to raise an issue entirely separate from the issue
of divided damages , with respect to which the government
petitioned.
That issue is whether the courts below correctly
apportioned fault between the parties.
In its brief in opposition, the thrust of the
arguments made by respondent were that

were to the offset

that this case is an inappropriate vehicle for reconsideration
by this Court of the divided-damages rule.
In its brief on the merits, the argument appears to
be -chat the courts below, the factual findings of the courts
below found by the district court and affirmed by the Court of
Appealst were incorrect. They are seeking a da novo reweighing
of those findings by this Court ultimately for a vacating of
the judge below and a remand to the court with instructions to
direct an increase in the judgment in its favor,
The contention that respondent need not crosspetition on an issue such as this, I think the cases of this
Court relatively clearly answer,
The general rule was perhaps most clearly stated, I
think, in Lang va» Green, and -the holding in that case has
been approved and extended, to some extent., in a number of
recent cases, including this Court’s recent decision in ITT vs.
Continental Baking.

s
I should bote additionally, sine® there appears to
be a misapprehension on this point, on the part of respondent,
that the present case is very much unlike Onion Oil Company
vsA The

JACINWO, the case which this Court took a couple

of years ago to consider the continuing vitality of the
divided-damages rule,
In -chat case, petitioner both petitioned, presented
the question of whether the finding of fault below was proper?
and, secondly, so far’as the respective negligence of the
parties, was concerned, the disputa there involved the dispute
over a question of law, and not an issue of fact which is
involved in this case.
Unlike the situation with which this Court was
presented in the SAN . JACINTO, then, this case presents is?,
clear and uncomplicated form the continuing vitality of the
divided-damages rule.
In our brief on the merits we attempted to set out
in some detail the historical antecedents of the divideddamages rule.

As noted there, the rule can b© traced with

spine assurance to rules of admiralty which one© prevailed in
England and Franc® and in roost other major maritime nations«
Originally, the rule was primarily — or rather exclusively a
risk-sharing device,
In the middle- of the Sixteenth Century, however, with
the development of negligence concepts, particularly in

7
English jurisprudence, the rationale of the rule began to
undergo a continuing process of erosion, & process which, 1
would suggest, has continued to this day.
By the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century,
application of the rule was restricted to cases in England, tc
cases of sole fault, and was expressly inapplicable pursuant
to -the decision of the House of Lords in Hay vs - LeR’eve,
inapplicable to cases of sol© fault, to cases of inevitable
accident, and to cases of inscrutable fault.

Inevitable

accident, -that is 'those cases of collisions., resulting from
such things as acts of God? and inscrutable fault, where fault
could not be •*« precise locus of fault could, not be determined.
The first case decided by this Court applying the
divided»damages rule, that is, the first case in which the
issue was squarely presented for decision was the SCHOONER
CATHARINE, which was decided by this Court in 1854,
From the opinion in that case and in subsequent
cases,

it's relatively clear -that the rule was adopted by

this Court for at least three reltively distinct reasons.
First, because of the assumed difficulty of courts in appor­
tioning damages other than equal in mutual-fault collision
cases? secondly, because it was hoped that the rule would
induce a greater degree of care in navigation? and, finally,
because of this Court’s abhorrence in applying a doctrine of
& bar of contributory negligence in cases of this sort.

8
We submit that none of these considerations carries
much weight today, but the latter rational© is particularly
instructive.

That is, that 'the divided damages rule represents

an improvement over the common law bar of contributory
negligence,
This Court*s refusal to import into admiralty law
the common law principle of contributory negligence is a
reflection of this Court’s inherent power, often affirmed,
to give or withhold damages in admiralty cases upon enlarged
principles of equity.
Perhaps nowhere in admiralty law has this principle
been more uniformly followed than in cases involving personal
injury or death,

Evan before this Court's decision Ln the

MAX MORRIS, in 1890, lower courts were apportioning damages
in collision »- in accidents subject to admiralty law,
accidents involving personal injury proportionally.
The Court in the MAX MORRIS, did not specifically
address that issue or did not decido that issue, although
decision, in -that case speeded that development.

Over time

the remedy of proportional damages has become co~terminus with
t.h substantive rights of people to maintain causes of action
in admiralty, personal injury and death.
That development has been specifically approved, by
Congress, of course, in the Jones Act *— implemented by
Congress in the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act,

9
as well as others.
So far as property damage is ornicernod, however# a

number of commentators, notably among them Gilmore and Black,
have suggested that it is far from clear that replacing a bar
of contributory negligence in mutual-fault collision eases
represents an improvement over the bar of contributory
negligence.
■The capacity of the rule to produce inequitable
results is, I think, amply demonstrated by th© facts of the
present case.
'The government in this case was found to have been
25 percent at fault, because of its failure to repair Rockaway
Point breakwater light more speedily*
Yet, under th© divided«damages rule, it is liable

for fifty percent of the total damages suffered in th®
»

stranding of the WHALEN6
Under the doctrine ©f contributory negligence, th©
government would be immune from any liability in this case,
even though it was found to .have bean 25 percent at fault*
In tlie first case under the divided^damagea rule
the windfall is in th® favor of respondento

Was there any damage to the light or was

QUESTIONS
it just to the tanker?
MR. RUPP;

2 think there was no damage to -the light.

l think all of the damage in the case, occasioned by th®

.10

stranding, was caused to the vessel and its cargo*
In the one case, the windfall is 25 pereant in
respondent’s favor*

If & contributory negligence doctrine

were applied in this area, the windfall would fo© 25 percent
in the government's favor.
The gap between what 1b

equitable in cases of this

sort, and the result produced by application of 'the divided**1
damages rule, I think becomes clearest in cases which involve
statutory fault.

Arid -the doctrine of statutory fault, of

course, emanates from this Court’s decision in THS PENNSYLVANIA*
The rule of THE PENNSY£,V&NX£ is that the party to a
collision guilty of a statory violation must prove not merely
that its fault might not have been on© of the causes- of the
collision or that it probably was not, but that it could not
have been.
This is a burden seldom carried in practice»

With

the- result that parties guilty of simply a technical violation
often find themselves condemned to pay fifty percent of the
damage by virtue of the joint operation of th® rule of Tha
PENNSYLVANIA and tli© divided-damages rule»
Not surprisingly, the number of such cases of widsly
disparate fault covered by th® divided-damages rule has
increased in rough proportion to th© proliferation of rules
of navigation»
Presently there are four sets of rules of navigation

11
provided by federal statutes

the International rules, the

Great Lakes rules, the Inland rules, and the Western'river
ruleso
As well as -three sets of pilot rules, regulations
issued by ■the Coast Guard and Stats and local .statutes and
regulations„
At pages 17 and 18 of our brief we sketch the
procedures generally applicable to admiralty cases involving
collisions, procedures which. I think put in some perspective
the scop© and the intensity of the criticism that over time
has been directed at application of the divided-damages rule
.in mutual-fault collisions.
M we indicated there, while the inequity of the
divided damages rule is often shielded to some efctent from
public scrutiny, there has been an increasing and substantial
amount of public criticism, particularly in recant years,
concerning application of -the rule.
Indeed, our research in this case has not turned
up a single commentator who has approved continued application
of the divided-damages rule, and I hasten to add that does not
mean -there are none; 1 simply haven’t found on©»
Perhaps the most telling criticism of the rule, and
the principal reason that -the government is her® today requesting
that it be abrogated in favor of a proportional-fault rule,
is that the United Status today stands alone among the major

12
maritime nations of the world in applying a divided-damages
rule in mutual-fault collision cases.
This fact, I think, is significant for several
reasons s
First, it provides rather conclusive support from the
view — for the view, rather, that there is a readily avail­
able and workable alternative to the rule of divided damages;
namely, the proportional-fault rule.
Second, the isolated maintenance of the divideddamage rule in this country has the inevitable effect of
encouraging transoceanic forum shopping, a point which is made,
I think most clearly, in Gilmore and Black's treatise.
Third, the fact that the United States alone applies
a rule of divided damages introduces into international
maritime commerce a good deal of unpredictability, and I
think an unnecessary amount of unpredictability.
This Court, v/@ submit, has already recognized the
~ implicitly recognized the unfairness of the divided-damages
rule, at least in the most extreme cases of disparate fault,
by creationg of a so-called major-minor fault exception.
The major-minor fault rule stems from this Court's
decision in THE CITY OF NEW YORK and THE UMBRIA.

The rule

was stated in THE CITY OF MEW YORK as follows;
"Where fault on the part of one vessel is ... of
itself, sufficient to account for the disaster ... any reason-

13
abla doubt with regard to the propriety of the conduct of such
other vessel should be resolved in the other vessel’s favor,”
As noted at pages 24 and 25 of our brief, the majorminor fault rule has proven extremely difficult to apply in
practice.
One of the problems of the rule is that it encourages
courts to avoid a full and fair consideration of cases on its
merits, in cases where the fault is obviously disparate.
More importantly, I think, however, is the fact
that the major-minor fault rule itself involves an inequity;
that is, it absolves parties from fault even though — excuse
me — it absolves parties from liability, from paying damages,
even though found to have been at fault.
The rule is, I think, then, to that extent, but a
variation of the contributory negligence doctrine.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the divided-damages rule

at least make it easier to settle these cases, so there's less
judicial time taken up with trying to figure out whether he
was 65 percent at fault or 35 percent at fault?
MR. RUPPt

That was a point which was discussed at

some length, 1 recall, in the briefs filed in THE SAN JACINTO.
I think that’s not the case.
If a party is involved in a collision in which his
fault is minor, and the lion's share of the damage occurs to
the other vessel, there is every motivation not to settle.

Because not to settle both gives the relatively lees negligent,
party a 3hot at the major-minor fault rule, and also stays
the day at which there is going to have to be a substantial
payment to the more negligent, relatively greater damaged
vessel.
I think the best -- the most that can be said 13 that
whether damages would be encouraged or discouraged, relatively,
by moving to a proportional fault rule, is speculative.
I can conceive — and I gave you an example of a
case In which the opposite would be the ease.

My opponent,

I am sure, can suggest an equal number of cases in which the
divided-damages rule would encourage settlement.
But I think that — my own view is that this Court
ought not to approve a rule which encourages settlements
which are unfair, wbioh is something that the divided-damages
rule does; that is, if —
QUESTION:

When you say unfair, you mean unfair

because of the rule?
MR. RUPP:

That's right.

Thatf s right.

Now, while the court reed not necessarily reach the
issue in this case, we would suggest that the major-minor
fault rule is itself badly in need of reconsideration.
If the rule of proportional f; ult is adopted, as we suggested,
I see little residual need left for the major-minor fault rule.

And that rule has masqueraded under various other names as
veil? itfs called wglo2ingM in seme courts; other courts
analyze fault in terms of their active or passive character­
istics in cases in which the fault is obviously disparate*
The opportunity to move away from the major-minor
fault rule, I think represents a major advantage of a
proportional fault rule, and people like Black and Gilmore and
Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit agree»
It is important that it be clearly understood that
the government is not, in this case, asking the Court to do
Congress's work, and to ratify the Brussels Convention of 1912»
It is true that part of the ercplanation for the
failure of the Convention to be ratified is the fact that
various of its provisions have been opposed by specific interest
groups.
That opposition has not, however, been directed at
the proportional fault rule, which appears in paragraph 1 of
Article IV of the Convention.

It has instead boon directed

at other provisions of the Convention which are severable»
Cargo interests, for example, have vigorously
opposed the elimination in paragraph 2 of Article IV of the
Convention of joint end several liability in. the event of a
collision? contending, X think with acme justification, that
such a change in their substantive right to recover should be
affectad, if at all, by the legislative process rather than

16

by treaty ratification.
A number of other groups have opposed Article VI,
which eliminates the legal presumptions of £&ult«
Congress's failure to replace the di\^id@d“damag0s
rule with a proportional fault rule, in the fac© of "the amcsfc
unanimous support for that course , evidenced during the hearings
on the Brussels Convention, simply means, we would suggest,
that the responsibility for the rule has remained where it
began:

with this Court#
As this Court stated in a not dissimilar context in

Moragne vs. States Lines, wa do not think that Congrss3ls
failure to take action on the pending bill or to pass a
similar measure over the years, as the law or deaths on
territorial waters became more incongrous, provides guidance
for the course that

wq

should take in this case#

To conclude that Congress, by not legislating on
this subject, has in effect foreclosed by negative legisla­
tion, as it.were, recsnsideration of prior judicial doctrine
would fee to disregard the fact that Congress has already left
in this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling
rules cf admiralty law#
I -think that applies with equal force here#
We arc satisfied, moreover, that there are no
impediments to adoption of the proportional fault rule by
this Court in -this case#

Although the rule of divided damages

17
has been applied in this country for over a hundred years,
it has become increasingly anomalous over time.

And the

reasons originally invoked in support o£ it have become
increasingly unpersuasive, I would suggest*
It seems a little late to argue, for example, that
courts will prove incapable of applying a doctrine of compara­
tive negligence.

The contrary has proven to have been the

case in all other places in the world, where the proportional
fault rule has been adopted by treaty, or by judicial
decisions, and courts in this country have long become
accustomed to applying proportional fault rules as well.
And it has proven capable of doing so more
particularly in admiralty, where personal injuries have been
involved.
If mathematical certitude is not possible, Gilmore
and Black are, nevertheless, surely correct in suggesting that
the porportional fault rule would at least not be designed to
go wrong in as many cases as the divided-damages rule.
It bears repeating in addition, I think, that we
are not asking in this case for the abrogation of the divideddamages — of divided damages, or a fifty-fifty division of
damages? in casas where the locus of fault, the precise locus
of fault or the percentage of contribution of fault cannot
be determined, or in cases in which fault is relatively equally
born® by both parties

.15

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose all we could decide in

this case, if we follov?ed your suggestion, is that 75/25
fault means 75/25 division of damages.
MR» RUPP:
QUESTION:
MR, RUPP:

That's right.

That's the —

We wouldn’t write a statute, I suppose.
No, that’s right, and that'3 precisely

what we’re asking for.
To the extent that it’s contended that the divideddamages rule is mor© likely to induce care in navigation than
a proportional fault rule, which was one of the principal
motivations for the decision in the SCHOONER CATHARINE, I
would suggest that the contention, at this point at least,
runs directly counter to logic and experience.
The divided-damages rule lumps the egregiously
negligent with the party guilty of only minor fault. The
result is to make the degree of respective fault irrelevant,
is to remove any inducement to the practice of greater and
greater degrees of care.
Finally, X should like to address myself briefly
to another point discussed at soma length in the merits
briefs in the SAN JACINTO case, but not touched upon to this
point by respondent in this case.
That is, that for this Court at this point to adopt
& proportional fault rule would be inconsistent with the

policies expressed by Congress in the Harter Act and the

IS
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act*
I think that that argument fails for several reasons.
One is that the only problem in that respect, if it
is a problem and we contend that it is not, steins from this
Court's decision in THE CHATTAHOOCHEE in 1899.

The Harter Act

was passed in 1893.
The Harter Act generally, with a number of exceptions,
relieves from direct suit the carrying vessel for damage to
cargo.
in THE CHATTAHOOCHEE, this Court decided that
Congress did not mean by the Harter Act to affect the
relationship between on© vessel and another, or, in a case of
this sort, between the United £Tates and the carrying vessel,
Arsd I think -the same result — I think that decision
was correct, and the Court has, I should point out, reached
the saif.e result in cases arising under the Workers and Long­
shoremen's Compensation Act in Armidalty, as well as undear
other statutes, Workmen’s Compensation type statutes.
There is no evidence in the legislative history of either
the Harter Act or the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act that
Congress meant to remove from this Court its historical
discretion to enforce rules which go to remedy in admiralty.
I see no inconsistency with the Harter Act, and the
course that the government is asking this Court to take in
this case

20
QUESTIONS Weil, does overruling THE HARRISBURG
automatically mean that, in addition to overruling the divided2*
damages — equal division of damages rule in cases of mutual
fault, does it also mean imposing the rule of proportional
damages, or division of damages in accordance with fault?
Or would — the alternative is, I suppose, to say well just
ordinary rules of contributory negligence would apply.

QUESTION:

MR, RUPP:

In part because

23
we felt it. wasn’t a matter for cart relief? and consequently
I don’t press it here,
QUESTION:

There’s a good deal of equity in it,

though, isn't there?
MR. RUPP:
QUESTION:

There may well be, yes.
Mr. Rupp, I couldn't hear Mr. Justice

Powell's question, and I hope this isn't repatative.
Is the government's position here consistent, in
your estimation, with the trend toward no-fault insurance?
MR. RUPP:

Well, I'm not as conversant on no-fault

insurance as I might be.

I think probably not.

We're not here concerned about the speediest, most
expeditious resolution of these disputes, although, in my
answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think there’s no reason to
believe that the approval by this.Court of a proportional fault
rule would lead to any less expedition.
The rule which we’re asking the Court to adopt here
is consistent with the normal rules of negligence, negligence
particularly as applied in th© area of personal injury in
admiralty law.
QUESTIONs

I notice there are no amicus briefs filed.

Does this indicate, in your view, that the insurance industry
is not vary concerned about the present state of affairs?
MR, RUPP:

It do®3, indeed.

I think that's particularly so, given the fact that

24
two years ago this Court gave very clear indication that it
w£s prepared to consider, again on the merits, the vitality
of the divided-damages rule.
In THE SAN JACINTO you got no merits briefs from
insurance companies or any other group.

I think that that's

explicable because, if one reads the hearings which have been
held on the Brussels Convention, it's apparent that no one
opposes this.

You've gotten no amicus briefs here, and I

think again it suggests that there is no real opposition,
other than the party standing to lose first by application of
a proportional fault rule.
QUESTION?

MR. RUPP:

No, there is absolutely not.
That’s all I meant.
Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rupp.

Mr. Mints.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF COPAL MINTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MINTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think the United States stands alone, as stated by
my friend here, because Congress has chosen to retain the
rule as is.

It’s an ample opportunity to either confirm the

Brussels Convention or to adopt a statute which would
incorporate the rul© in respect tc divided damages.
QUESTION:

You don't think it’s just legislative

inertia?
MR. MINTS:

I doubt it very much because Congress

has been very active in legislating in this area of
admiralty.

It's

hdoptad any number of statutes, and to

assume that Congress has not taken up this out of lethargy
seen® to roe is being unfair to Congress.
Now, I think it's more fair to say that Congress

26

has decided the rule as is is better than the proposed one»
I would like now to go to my argument»

Contrary to

the contentions that have been made by my friend, I think the
issues here still are:

one, is this case an appropriate

basis for the reconsideration of the divided-damage rule?
X will elaborate on that in just a minute.

;<In the

meantime I want to set forth the other merits — issues.
Two, is this Court the appropriate forum or body
to consider changing the rule, or should it be left to
Congress ?
And three, are the merits of the rule and of the
alternative urged by petitioner, is the latter equitable,
more ligical, more practical, and thus more desirable than
the present rule?
I must suggest that the government must prevail on
J

each of these issues in order to be entitled to a judgment in
its favor from this Court.
Now, on the first issue, there is no finding, really,
of 25 percent and 75 parcent? that's an adjudication, it's a
judgment, so expressed by Judge Dudd.

He said, it's difficult

to arrive at mathematical determinations and, under all the
evidence, I conclude that the 25 and 75 is fair.
QUESTION: Well, you would agree, I take it, that in
some cases it's more readily done than in others?
MR. MINTZ:

Yes.

And. in those cas©3 where it's

27
evident that one is very slightly at fault, then you don’t
give them a recovery, and you don't hold them liable.
I should say don’t hold them liable.
But where you come to — how does one say it.fs 25,
not 30, not 35; 75, not 65?

What basis is there to make

those determinations, as far as fault is concerned?
Beyond that, I suggest that’s irrelevant.
where you have a situation where, but

Because

for the negligence of

both, there would be no accidents, that is irrelevant,
whether a contribution of one or the other is 25 or 75, or
whatever the ratio may be, if he hadn't been at fault there
would have been no accident.
Therefore, why should he not share in the damage
that is the result of the co-negligence of both parties?
Now, moreover, the government has been guilty of a
/

statutory violation:fox- over 24 hours it left that light
unlit.

It knew it.

It had notice of it.

And under the rules

that my friend has cited, this Court has several times decided
that where the cause of a disaster or accident is a violation
of a statutory duty, that then it bears the entire liability
unless it’s conclusively demonstrated that it wasn’t the sole
cause.
Noxtf, so we have here a prima facie case where the
sole cause was the government’s.

Yet Judge Dudd, finding

that the accident would not have occurred — that is the finding

28

of fact, that the accidant would not have occurred, and the
damages would not have baan sustained if the light had not
been not burning.
So we have here a straightforward finding which brings
into play the rule that I have just adverted to, and that my
friend adverted to, ..that where the negligence consists of
violation of a statutory duty, the violator bears the entire
brunt of the damage.
So that here we have a case which, under normal
rules, would have resulted -- by application of normal rules,
would have resulted in a finding that the government is liable
for the entire damage.
And yet wa are asked hare to — the Court is asked
her® to male© a determination, nevertheless, that damages
dhould remain apportioned, or should be apportioned 75 to the
government and — I mean 25 to the government and 75 to the
vessel? which I think is a gross injustice and which I think
illustrates that the rule for which the government is now
asking, is really an unfair rule,
And I •»«*
QUESTIONS

You think fifty/fifty is unjust, too,

MR, MINTS:

In a case like this where the damage —

don’t you?

where the negligence was entirely the government's, or whoever
.it may be, in such a case, the damage, the entire damage

29
should bo born© by the person who is thus negligent#
And that was the determination in several casos by this Court,
where they held that violation of a duty cast upon the
violator was a complete responsibility for the consequences»
QUESTION:

But you would still want to get off with

fifty percent — you're willing to get off with fifty
percent?
MR» MINTZ:
But that is

No,

not our desire.

I'm not,

I'm not.

We may have to.

We were cross-appellants in the

Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

But you're not cross-appallants here.

QUESTION:

You're not a cross-petitioner here.

MR. MXNTZ;

We couldn't have been a cros3**petitioner

here, because I don't think, under Rule 19, because —
responsibly petition this Court to consider this case under
the determination of the fact of who is more liable than the
other.

That's a question that arises in normal cases, and

this Court takes cases only when there's a rule of law
involved, and not when it’s an issue of fact.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mints, 3id I understand you to say

that the fault was entirely that of the Coast Guard?
MR. MINTS:

Yas.

QUESTION: But the district judge found to the contrary,
didn't he?

MR. MXNTZ;

No, he didn't.

30
QUESTION:

But he says that —»

MR. MINT2:

He's inconsistent.

He says:

But

for

the negligence of the government, this accident would not have
happened.
That's a finding of fact.

The rest is a conclusion

of law.
QUESTION:

You think this is a conclusions

The

fault of the vessel was more egregious than the fault of the
Coast Guard?
MR. MINTS:

Yes, I think it is where the basic

finding — evidentiary finding is, that but for the fault of
the government this would not have happened.
That's his evidentiary finding.
QUESTION:

Where is that?

MR. MINTZ:

In his decision.

It's repeated twice.
said it's common sense.
determination:

And the Court of Appeals

The Court of Appeals agreed with that

that but for the negligence of the government,

this case would — this fault would not have happened.
QUESTION:

Well, any time you have a finding of

negligence plus proximate cause on the part of two parties
to an accident —
QUESTION:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

“» they’re both responsible to a degree,

aren’t they?

31
HR. HINT3s

Wall* what I'm saying* Your Honor* is

that where the judge determines that but for the negligence
of the government there would have keen no accident, then
there is no causative negligence on the part of the one who's.,
been hurt.
questions

all.

Well, I just don't follow you on that at

Surely he could find, with more reason on this record

that had it not been for your master's fault there would have
been no accident.
MR. MINT^s

No, because the master's fault was

occasioned by the absence of the light.
QUESTION* Well, he —
MR. M1NTZ:

He would not have been -- that’s what

the finding isy he would not have made the maneuver ha did if
he had known where he was, and he would have known where he
was if he had tha light.
If Your Honors will read the decision of Judge Judd,
you will find those are his basic findings, and those were
confirmed by the Court of Appeals„
QUESTION!

But that's kind of a "but for" causation

type of thing, that even though it's a fairly minor fault,
if he had Stdd s,but for the government's fault it wouldn't
have happened", even though your man was very far afield from
normal care after he acted on his own.
MR. MINTZ i

But why was he where he was?

Not by

32

reason of poor navigation, he was

where he was beeuase ha was

misled by the absence of the light.
QUESTION*

But that "but for" type of causation is

a final conclusion that has been rejected in almost every branch
of jurisprudence, hasn't it?
MR. MINTZs

Well, I'm not — I don't know of that

at all, and I don't see that if you say that's not a finding
of fact, I think the 75 and 25 are not findings of fact,
either.
QUESTION*

Mr. Mintz, may I read from the Court of

Appeals opinion?
"We hold that the court was not clearly erroneous
in finding that the negligence of both parties, in the
proportion stated, caused the strahding.o

The vessel’s claim

that it was not at fault borders on the frivolous."
MR. MINTZ:

Yes, I —

QUESTION: And you say that's a finding of the Court
that you were right.

Is that your position?

MR. MINTZ* . No, the Court —
QUESTION: Well, what language do you rely on?
MR. MINTZ:

I rely on the findings of Judge Judd

that "but for the negligence of the government this accident
would not have happened."
QUESTION: And you say the Court of Appeals approved
that?

33
MR. MINTS: And the Court of Appeals said yes, it’s
a matter of common sense.
QUESTION: Where does it say that?
Oh, never mind, I’ll find it.

Like I found this

other one.
MR. MINTZ*

It's there.

The Court found —* here’s the Court of Appeals —
the Court found -QUESTION: Where are you reading from?
MR. MINTZ:

I’m reading from page 4 of my brief —

QUESTION:

Oh, well, I’ll get the opinion itself.

MR. MINTZ:

No, you will find it on page 10 of

the Appendix.
QUESTION:
MR. MINTZ:

Right.
The Court found, as common sense would

dictate, that if the breakwater light had been operating, the
\

captain

would not have stranded the vessel.
QUESTION:

That’s in the next paragraph after

3aying what you said was frivolous.
MR. MINTZ:

That’s correct.

Those again are

inconsistent.
And Judge Judd said:

If the breakwater light had

been flashing, the captain would doubtless hav© been able to
change his course in time to avoid stranding.
QUESTION: What was he talking about there?

34
The last clear-chance doctrine is what he was
talking about.

Which is not her©»

MR, MINTZ:

Well, I don’t know what hers talking

about, the last clear chance —
QUESTION: Well, if you go further down in the para­
graph you’ll see it.
"We refuse to apply here the doctrine o£ last clear
chance, which has been given only limited application in
admiralty,"
QUESTION:

Isn't there some Internal inconsistency

in Judge Judd’s findings and statements?
MR, MINTZ:
QUESTION:
HR. MINTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. MINTS:

Is there inconsistency?
Yes, internal inconsistency,
I think there is.
Yes.
I think there is.

QUESTION: That complicates things, doesn't it?
MR. MINTZ:

It &>oas, sir.

It does, sir,

I'm glad Your Honor fasIs that there is an incon­
sistency.

That's bean my argument all along.

That you can't

put the two together, and justify both of them.
And for the Court of Appeals to have said that we
bordered on the frivolous in arguing that, I'd like to say,
if I may, on attending recently a session of the Court of
Appeals, where, on application for parol,© after conviction,

35
pending appeal, the argument was always mad©., the trial judge
said that was a frivolous appeal, and on© of the Justices
replied, or answered:

Well, he remembers that when he was

a district judge he regarded many applications for bail as
being frivolous, but now that he's on the Court of Appeals
he has a different view of that.
So I think that applies to the statement that
borders on the frivolous, when we have a situation of the kind
Your Honor has just pointed to.
Now, assuming that we have here a split liability
cas© or split fault case, the question then is:

Should this

Court reconsider th© rule?
Now, this has haan a rule of this Court since 1843,
it has been mentioned and repeatedly discussed and repeatedly
sustained in a number of cases, and I can read them off:
Catharine vs, Dickinson, 17 How. in 1843; th©
NORTH STAR in 1882? the MAX, MORRIS in 1890? the CHATTAHOOCHEE
in 1899? the EUGENE MORAN in 1909? White Oak Transportation, in
1922? Wayerhauaer in 1963, and just recently, a few years ago,
Cooper Stevedoring vs, Koroske in 1974, where, in an opinion
by Justice Marshall, there was express approval of the rule,
although you did make a footnote that you're not called upon
to reconsider it because -there was no finding that had to be
reviewed — something to that affect.
And w® also have the factor that we had the

36
Brussels Convention, it had been submitted to the Congress
for ratification, Congress failed — has failed continually.
There has been no preface for Congress to go ahead.
And for this Court to undertake to refashion the rule
which has been in existence for so many years, and has been
repeatedly taken into account, it seems to me is rather
inappropriate,

I suggest that this is really legislation and not
adjudication, and that it’s more properly in the area of
Congress than the area of the Judiciary.
To be sure, there have been many commentators who
have found fault with the rule, including among them very
eminent jurists? but that, in and of itself, is not sufficient
because there is always disagreement among lawyers and among
judges on various phases of the law? and that doesn’t mean
that the Courts refashion -the rules,
I am not suggesting that the Court is without power
to do so, X am suggesting that in the circumstnacss of this
case, where there has been —- where the history is as it is,
it would be inappropriate for this Court to undertake to do
the work which Congress should do and which has refused to do,
indicating that it’s quite content to let the rule stay as it
is.
Now, on 'the merits of the rule, X think T. indicated
to some extent my thinking on the subject.

X think that where

37

an accidant is the result of co*-negliganc© on two parties or
three parties , whatever it may be, in a situation where, but
for the negligence of both, there would have been no accident,
it is immaterial, it*a irrelevant as to how much fault, in
what proportion the parties were at fault*

Because the

accident would not have happened if both had not been at
faults, and both having been at fault it's fair and just that
the damages should be borne equally, rather than attempting
to say, well, you

were only 10 percent negligent, so w© are

going to hold you liable for 10 percent of the consequences*
Whan, but for the ten percent, there would nb.t have
been th© accident.
And then again we have this practical problems
how do you assess fault on a mathematical basis?

When the

conduct is not in the mathematical area.
It's easier fco say som's party was negligent or
not negligent.

But it's not easy to say they were at fault

to a certain extent.
And I rest on that, and more importantly I rest
on tlie proposition that it is immaterial consideration that
if I contributa to somebody’s damage and I did that to a
substantial degress, that I am wrongly liable for the whole
d&raaga? but if th® other fellow was also damaged — liable,
it’s perfectly fair for me to pay hair of his damagesand for
him to pay half of my damages, where the accidant would not

38
/

otherwise have happened,
I think I've covered the substance of my argument,
and will not detain this Court any longer,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
