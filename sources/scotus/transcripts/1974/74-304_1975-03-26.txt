ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM ELDRED JACKSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JACKSONs

— Resumed

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
First, if I may, I would like to deal with two
questions from the Bench yesterday afternoon.
First, Mr. Justice Stewart asked a question of the
petitioner with respect to tine legislative history of the
Exchange Act, and in particular a draft which utilized the
word "uniform", "uniform rates", and that matter is laid out
at pages 20 and 21 of the SEC's brief, Your Honor,
Secondly, it has been suggested that perhaps I
misunderstood a question from Mr. Justice White, with regard
to the antitrust situation, if fixed rates are abolished on
May 1st in accordance with the SEC*s directive.
I understood the question to relate to Exchanges, and
I answered that there would be no antitrust liability.
Obviously they would not be fixing rates any more.
But if Your Honor*s question related to the situation
of brokers, members of Exchanges, I*d like to make it clear

44
that, at least in my- view, there is no question that if
Merrill Lynch and Bache or other firms got together and fis*ed
the rates between them, they would be subject to the full range
of antitrust liabilities and penalties*
QUESTION*

Apparently, then, the fact that the

Commission has authority either to order or to — to order
uniform rates or to order non-uniform rates, or to say that
there should be no uniform rates, and to say that there
shouldn't be an Exchange rule about it, the Commission's
jurisdiction would not be exclusive?
MR. JACKSON*

Not in the case of members of Exchanges

fixing rates amongst themselves, in my judgment.
QUESTION*

So that the power of the Commission to

have a rule and to enforce it would not oust the antitrust
laws in that area?
MR. JACKSON*

Not in that area, in ray judgment.

It

would if the Exchanges again reinstituted fixed rates at some
time in the future, and assuming no change ii the statute.
QUESTION* Well, what if the Exchange had a —
replaced its present rule in accordance with the Commission's
directive to say that there should be no — there is no uniform
rate?
MR. JACKSON*

Yes, Your Honor.

That's the situation

I*m addressing myself to.
There would no longer be fixing of ratos by the

45

Exchange.
QUESTION*

So then you’ve got just the Silver —

you' vs got the antitrust remedy, could supplement or it would
just be unaffected by the Securities lav/ then?
MR* JACKSONs

Well, the antitrust remedy would run

only against members.
QUESTION*

I understand,

MR. JACKSON*

I understand that.

Members, and it would be *—

QUESTION*

As conspiring against each other.

MR. JACKSON*

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

And the Exchanges would be out of the business of fixing
rates•
QUESTION:

But even though their conspiring would

be contrary to an Exchange rule, the antitrust lav/s could
still go *—
MR, JACKSON:

Yes, in that instance, that’s my

view. Your Honor.
QUESTION*

Well, your

submission is that the

Commission's jurisdiction is exclusive over the Exchange as
such.
MR. JACKSON*

Exactly, Your Honor.

Exactly,

And it's that jurisdiction from which we believe that
exemption is derived.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if the members violated the

Exchange rules, the Exchange could discipline them.

46
MR. JACKSONs
QUESTION?

Yes# exactly,

But th© fact that the Exchange could

discipline them does not mean that the antitrust laws would
be ousted.

If the members were conspiring# exactly#

MR. JACKSON*
Your Honor.
QUESTION*

Right.

MR, JACKSONs
QUESTION*

Right,

Really# what you're saying is that if the

individual members of the Exchange violate some federal law#
they are subject to the same penalties as any other citiren who
violates a federal law,
MR, JACKSON *
QUESTION:
sion has no

Exactly# sir.

Well# idie Securities and Exchange Commis»»

whatever its jurisdiction is# it isn’t such as

to preclude an antitrust remedy on those facts?
MR. JACKSON*
QUESTION;

Against members —
Unh-hunh.

MR. JACKSON*

— conspiring# themselves# to violate

the antitrust laws,
QUESTION*

Right.

MR, JACKSONs

After fixed rates

Exchange fixed

rates are over.
And I just wanted to make that clear# because perhaps
1 hadn't been clear yesterday.

47
If I may recapitulate. Your Honors, our position in
this case, which of course deals with past conduct, is that
the Exchanges are entitled to an antitrust exemption for this
limited area of activity, the fixing of commission rates,
through implied repeal of the antitrust laws on the twin
grounds of:

first, irreconcilability of the two statutory

schemas; and, secondly, because the jurisdiction of the district
courts under the antitrust laws would create a conflict with
SEC jurisdiction and would prevent the functioning of the
Exchange Act, and this presents the different case which this
Court reserved in Silver,,
Now, Mr, Shapiro yesterday afternoon, if I under­
stood him correctly, suggested that there might be various
degrees of exemption, including concurrent jurisdiction of
the courts and the SEC, depending on the type of procedure
utilized by the SEC, whether it was action or inaction or
formal order or whatnot, and it seemed to me that this argument
dwelt rather much on form over substance.
But, in any event, I would suggest that the argument
derives no support from either Section 19(b) of the Exchange
Act, and certainly not from the implied repeal cases.
Because either the Exchange Act creates an implied
exemption, or it does not,

I fail to see any room for shades

of gray in & matter of that area, and it seems to me that
certainly the Exchanges of this country are entitled to know

48
with, some certainty what conduct on their part is lawful and
what is not.
Mr. Shapiro also argued? if I understood him correctly?
that there could be no pugnancy in this situation? and there»
fore no exemption? until and unless the SEC actually issued a
formal order to the Exchange to fix commission rates.
And this is a mirror image? I believe? of the? what
I regard as a concession in the Department of Justice's brief?
at page 48? that if there were a formal order by the SEC to
the Exchanges to fix rates? no antitrust liability could arise,
Now? by limiting this concession to a formal order?
I would submit that the argument fails to recognise the unique
statutory scheme of the Exchange Act? and of Section 19(b)
which does not provide for direct SEC regulation by formal
order.

It is not a public utility type regulatory statute.

It has provided for a system of Exchange self“regulation.
The Exchanges first? themselves? on their own
initiative? adopt rules.

The SEC has the power? if it deems

those rules objectionable? in the light of the statutory
standards? to first request an Exchange to change them.

And

if the Exchange does so? that's the end of the matter.
If the Exchange refuses the request? then and only
then does the SEC have to proceed by a formal hearing and an
order or a rule.
So that, the argument? which Mr. Shapiro made? it seems

49
to roe, would in essence rewrite Section 19(b) of the Exchange
Act by requiring an order; whereas the Act itself indicates
that requests by the SEC and compliance by the Exchange are
sufficient to achieve the statutory objectives without a
hearing* and without an order,
QUESTION*
has happened?

What about the situation where nothing

The Exchange has a rule and the SEC has never

addressed itself to it,
MR, JACKSON*
QUESTION*

Now, in that -«■

Although it has the power to,

MR, JACKSON*

Exactly,

In that situation, Your

Honor, — let’s assume that —- the Exchange adopts a rule,
it has to be profiled with the SEC three weeks before it
becomes effective, the SEC looks it over, finds nothing
objectionable
QUESTION*

Well, it doesn't say a word.

You don't

know whether it does or not,
MR, JACKSON*

Well, it has the power, as you've

indicated, and it has the duty, I would submit, under the
statute to request and, if request is refused, to order the
Exchange to change it if it doesn't comport with the statutory
standards,
QUESTION*

well, so:

do you accept the test in

Silver that there is immunity where some rule is essential to
the effectuation of the Act?

50
MR. JACKSONs

I do not accept that test* because I

do not believe that is the test that this Court laid down in
the Silver case,
QUESTIONS

Well* what do you think the test was

there?
MR* JACKSONs

Well# in the Silver case? as I read it?

what this Court was saying was this*

What may be necessary to

make the Act work in a given case would be implied repeal of
the antitrust laws.
It did not say# as I read it# what might be
necessary to make the Act work would be a particular rule or
practice of an Exchange.
That# sir# in my judgment# is where the Thill Court#
the Seventh Circuit# got off the tracks.
QUESTION:

But then# in that effect# your position

is that any tiling the SEC — any rule the SEC fails to disapprove
is automatically immune from antitrust attack?
Regardless of its over-all position in the Act# and
regardless of whether or not the SEC might say# Well# it just
isn't harmful.
MR. JACKSONs

That certainly is my position# Your

Honor# and it*s because of the existence of the SEC°s
jurisdiction# and also because I don't understand a fundamental
justice and fairness of holding an Exchange liable for treble
damages for doing something that a government agency has power

51
to stop, but does not stop,
And I think that there ia an exemption in those cir­
cumstances.
I think there's an exemption —
QUESTION*
rule, then.

But that*8 a considerably different

Do you find that in Silver or in some case?

MR. JACKSON*
QUESTION*

I find this may be —

You find it in the statute, I suppose

that's your best answer, isn't it?
MR. JACKSON*
Parker v» Brown,

Well, I think I analogize it to

which was argued yesterday.

to government action.

It comes close

It's inaction, but to me it has the

effect of action, because the hand is withheld when tie hand
could have been stretched out and stop the action by this
private party* but instead the government agency doesn't do
so.

QUESTION*

You're saying it's something more than

the government just not discovering some wrongdoing or
some other — there are a sufficiently small number of
Exchanges that the SEC presumably is cognizant of v*hat they
are doing.
MR. JACKSON*

Precisely, Your Honor.

And the

Exchanges — the SEC does know, because rules, as I said,
have to be filed in advance for scrutiny.

And if there's

something wrong in a rule-., such as the commission-fixing rule,

52
they can say*

Stop it*

As a matter of fact* they have said Rstop it” as of
May 1st*
QUESTIONS

Are you arguing that this is a sort of

de facto approval when they fail to disapprove after notice?
MR» JACKSON:

I would argue that it has the legal

effact of approval* since they have the power to disapprove,,
QUESTION* Are there not some statutes relating to
regulatory agencies which provide a mechanism* like the filing
of a tariff which* if not disapproved* goes into effect?
MR» JACKSON*
QUESTION*
MR. JACKSONt

Yes* Mr» Chief Justice»
Any in areas other than tariffs?
Well* l*m certainly aware of that

procedure for tariffs, I believe under the Interstate Commerce
Act? and* if I’m not mistaken* perhaps also under the Shipping
Act.

But that is not the same as the procedure in this case*

because those tariffs* as I understand those Acts* require
some affirmative action by the agency.
In this case* the structure of the statute is such
that no affirmative action is required in order for the Exchange
rules* on whatever subject* to become effective.

Affirmative

action by the agency is required only to set them aside*
and therefore* inaction has* to me as I said* the effect* the
same effect as affirmative action? and the result should be
the same in terms of antitrust exemption* I would submit.

53

In effect, the result of Mr, Shapiro*s argument
would mean this*

that in order to avoid antitrust liability,

an Exchange would have to refuse a request from the SEC, even
though it was perfectly willing to do what the SEC asked it
to do, and precipitate a hearing, precipitate an order, and
then, at last, come to rest with its absolution.
And I submit that that would be a charade, a sham,
and hardly a useful exercise,
QUESTION*
beyond

Well, of course, there's something

I don’t1 suppose thi3 Court is necessarily bound by

Mr, Shapiro’s concession on page 48, either,
MR, JACKSON*
QUESTION*

Of course not,

And part of his argument, of course, has

been, then, that even if the SEC approves — I mean, arguably,
even if the SEC approves, it has no authority at all to
immunize under the antitrust laws? that it has no responsibility
for competitive consideration? that it, if it approves, acts
wholly within the scope of the Securities laws, and has no
eye to

and no authority with respect to the antitrust laws,
MR, JACKSON*
QUESTION*

well, I —
That’s been the holding in some other

contexts with some other agencies,
MR, JACKSON*

Well, on the other hand, Your Honor,

the — I think it’s quits clear under this Court’s decision
in, I believe. Gulf Utilitias, that the public interest standards
.-itt-

*vi

54
which are embraced in the Exchange Act* 19(b)* would include
competitive considerations#
And 1 say also that those considerations have been
considered by the SEC in the past* as is reflected in this record#
In fact* going as far back as 1941 in the Multiple Trading case*
where they brought a proceeding against the Exchange on anti­
competitive groundsb

Those factors have been considered* and*

as I said yesterday*

they have been considered with the active

assistance of the Department of Justice* which has intervened
in the hearings which the SEC has held on this subject#
Now* I would submit* Your Honors* that the argument
of Mr. Shapiro means that if there can be exemption only x>jh<sre
there is «in order* there is no exemption* and this would repeal
the doctrine of implied repeal* and would result in endless
litigation rather than regulation.
Thank you*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. NERHEIM* ESQ#*
ON BEHALF OF THE S#E#C. AS AMICUS CURIAE*
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR, NERHEIM*

Mr# Chief Justice* may it please the

Court*
To the extent that time permits today* I would like
to present the Commission's views on the issue in this case*

55
by discussing three points, and in doing so address myself
to some of the questions asked by this Court yesterday»
The first point is, What is the regulatory scheme of
the Exchange Act, and how did Congress deal with the question
of fixed commission rates in that scheme?
The second is. How dees that regulatory scheme
actually work at the SEC, and what has the SEC been doing for
the last 41 years in dealing with the question of fixed
rates?
And, third, Why, to use this Court’s expression,
we believe a plain repugnancy exists between two regulatory
regimes, and why the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act
simply will not work, as Congress intended it, if antitrust
courts are given the opportunity to substitute their judgments
for the reasoned regulatory judgment of the Commission*
QUESTION s

Who should make the docision as to

whether there’s repugnance?
MR, NERHEIM*

This Court.

QUESTION* Well, what’s the matter with the Exchange
making it?
MR, NKRHEIM*
QUESTION*
MR. NERHEIMs
QUESTION*
MR. NERHEIM*

Tha distinct ~*»
You don’t claim that authority?
No, we don’t. Your Honor.
But why not?

Why not?

We don’t claim the authority to

56
determine a repugnancy issue0
QUESTION*

Well* in the first instance* you have to

make the decision* do you not?
MR, NERHEIM*

Well* in the first instance* Your

Honor* we apply the standards of the Act* the public interest
standards of the Act* and we do consider competitive considera­
tions? but we also consider other economic considerations*
regulatory considerations* and the other considerations under
the Act.
And then take action*
And we believe that*s the Commission exercising its
jurisdiction* and we do not believe that then mar action should
be attacked collaterally in an antitrust action*
The Congress gave the Commission specific authority
under the *34 Act to do several things.
It gave it specific authority to adopt rules*
mandatory rules* concerning financial responsibility*
concerning borrowing practices* concerning manipulative and
deceptive practices* and concerning practically every other
important thing dealing with investor protection.
And the Congress also gave the SEC authority to
register stock exchanges* to police stock exchanges* and to
require amendments to their constitution and by-lav/s as the
Commission determines necessary in the interest of investor
protection

57
Now, in Section 19(b) Congress gave the Commission
jurisdiction to supervise rules and require changes in Exchange
by-laws and rules and regulations in such matters as twelve
enumerated categories and similar matters, including
specifically the authority to regulate the fixing of fixed
commissions by Exchanges.
The subject of fixed commissions by Exchanges had
been 142 years old in 1934 when Congress addressed itself to
this issue.
And Congress argued as to how to regulate that
practice, not whether they should be outlav/ed.

Congress chose

to regulate the practice by subjecting it to the jurisdiction
of its new federal agency, like so many other things it did.
Now, in the Act, Congress gave the Commission a
variety of regulatory tools* it gave the Commission authority
to adopt rules and impose them upon the industry* it gave the
Commission authority to conduct investigations, hold hearings,
and make recommendations to the industry, and expect them to
follow the recommendations.
It gave it authority to supervise these rules, and
to require changes.

It gave it authority to issue demand

letters, which are called the 19b letters of request* in
effect are demands.
And, lastly, it gave it the ultimate club of giving
the Commission authority to withdraw or suspend the regiatra-

58
tion of an Exchange for failure to follow a Commission rule#
order# or regulation»
That is the regulatory scheme we* re talking about
today# and it is the regulatory scheme that Mr» Justice Blackmun
analysed In the Ware case just 15 months ago# in talking about
the kinds of direct supervisory authority the SEC had# and
then other areas# like Ware# like Silver? but in that case
analyzed that there should be a repealer when we are talking
about an area over which the Commission has direct supervisory
jurisdiction.

Which we think is this case.

Now# yesterday a question was asked by Mr, Justice
White about the Commission*s authority to take action against
a member of an Exchange for violating an Exchange rule»
And that — the answer to that question is that there
are four parts to itt
The Commission does have authority to take action
directly against a member# if the member violates the Exchange
Act or an SEC rule or regulation*

It doesn’t specifically

refer to Exchange rules*
The SEC does have specific power under Section 15B of
the Exchange Act to reokve the authority of a member to do
business in the securities industry if it violates certain
conduct in that section.

But again it doesn’t specifically

refer to Exchange rules.
Thirdly# if that conduct in violating the Exchange rule

59
also violated another rule of the Commission or of the statute#
then the Commission has direct authority under section 21 to
bring an injunctive action against that member for violating
the statute# or a rule or regulation of the Commission*
And then lastly{, of course# the Commission has the
authority# under 19(a)(1) to withdraw the registration of an
Exchange for failure to comply# or force compliance by its
members of its own rules? which the Commission did in 1966#
revoking the registration of the San Francisco Mining
Exchange for, among other things# just that?

failing to

require compliance by Exchange members.
The question was also asked yesterday# and Mr,
Jackson came back to it today# and 1 think the Commission
woul like to make its position clear on the question of what
happens after May 1# 1975# when we have said there shall be
no practice of fixed rates.
We ■”*»
QUESTION*

Yes# what happens if two or more members

of the Exchange agree together to fix rates,
MR. NERHEIM*

Precisely.

We were a little bit pusas led yesterday by Mr,
Jackson*s comment# but today we agree completely*

that after

May 1st# if we have adopted a rule# as we have# that there
shall be no — that Exchanges shall not have rules requiring
their members to fix rates# and if members thereafter do

60

agree to fix their rates# high or low or wherever# we do not
claim that the existence of the Exchange Act, the presence of
the SEC# repeals or exempts antitrust application of that
situation.
Nor# indeed# would we if members did some tiling like
that today.

Even in a fixe derate environment.

Because members

can charge more than minimum-commission rates,
QUESTION*

That is# today# if members# a couple of

members of the Exchange agreed to divide their markets or —
ME, NERHEIM*
QUESTION*

Exactly# that's another example —
— that would be clearly amenable to the

antitrust laws# and you®re saying that —
MR, NERHEXM*

And we agree# and we would not claim

any repealer for that kind of anticompetitive conduct,
QUESTION*

And I don't — would you claim some —

let's assume the claim was that the Exchange was conniving with
those conspirators # how about the liability of the Exchange?
MR, NERHEXM*

We — if there was an allegation of

conniving or conspiracy by the Exchange with its members# we
would say the mere presence of the SEC or its jurisdiction
would not exempt the antitrust application,
QUESTION*

And so today if there were some —if

two or three of the — any kind of conspiracy then among the
members# today# under the present — even under a rule that did
set minimum rates# if members conspired either to charge higher

61
or lower prices than that, you wouldn't think — you vrould say
there would be antitrust liability»
. MR, NERKEIM*

Right»

Yes, we would, Your Honor.

There would be antitrust liability there because we do not
believe that application of the antitrust laws collides or
conflicts with our jurisdiction in that case, but we believe
it's supplementary and complementary to our jurisdiction.
We are concerned about those acts and practices and
rules which Exchanges and their members operate under, which
are consistent with our jurisdiction and consistent with our
policy, not inconsistent.
Now, the second aspect of our presentation is to
just describe how this process under this regulatory scheme
works in practice.
Our brief and our documentary appendix go into
detail, to describe the steps taken by the SEC over the last
41 years, most particularly the last 15 years, in reviewing,
approving, modifying, changing, and finally eliminating the
practice of fixed rates.
These studies contained in practically the entire
Documentary Appendix, and indeed most of the Appendix of the
Petitioners, these studies, hearings, investigations, 19b
letters, demand letters, have resulted, in 1968, in the
introduction of a volume discount by Exchanges.
They resulted in the introduction of a non-member

62
discount in 1971# permitting persons who are not members of
the Exchange to get a 40 percent discount from the public rate.
The Exchanges in that situation had come in with a
rule proposing a 30 percent non-member discount# and we said
no# it had to be 40 percent.
percent discount.

And the Exchange adopted a 40

That’s how this process works.

These studies and these letters also resulted in the
elimination of the give-up practice in 1968# at the SEC’s
insistence.
These policies and these procedures resulted in the
elimination of fixed rates for under $2#000 and for over
$500,000# and then for over $300#000; all of which came at the
insistence of the EEC through these informal procedures# 19b
letters# if you will.
Mow# we heard yesterday that the Commission should act
by order# and that the antitrust laws would not apply if the
Commission ordered these things.

I suppose we could issue

orders on every single rule; but that isn’t the way the
Exchange Act intended us to operate.
QUESTION?

Now, suppose an Exchange files a rule

with you# and you look it over# ad you don't think it requires
any approval or disapproval; you just don't take any action?
You say that's tantamount to approval —
MR. NEEHEIM:
QUESTIONS

Yes# Your —

—* just as though you issued an order.

63

Now# is that — how can anybody get a review of that?
MR, NERHEIMs

Well# let me — may 1 first answer

the first part of that# Mr. Justice# by saying we simply don’t
file those rule changes in a drawer, and —
QUESTIONs

Well# I understand.

answered that# I think# earlier.
MR. NERHEIMs

You’ve already

But —•

All right.

So that when there is this

procedure by the SEC to not disapprove# because we believe that
the rule change is consistent with the Act# that we believe .is
agency action9 and as the Circuit Court —
QUESTIONS

As long as it’s consistent with the Act#

do you say that —•
MR, NERHEIMs
QUESTION»

No# we —
* "as long as it’s consistent with the

Act# we think that it ought to be"?
MR. NERHEIMs

Well# we say that it ought to be# but

we believe that that is agency action# and is reviewable tinder
the Administrative Procedure Act.
And the Circuit Court —
QUESTIONS

How do you know -** how do you ever know
V

when that happens?
MR, NERHEIMs When the agency took the action?
Well# if you’re following the developments of Exchanges with
respect to rule changes # you. would know when they put into
effect a rule change.

64
QUESTION*

And how do we —* how would you know when

you decided not to do anything about it?
MR* NERHEIM*

Well, it would be at that point, because

if a rule change comes in and we have reason to question it,
we would then notify the Exchange that "we suggest you not
adopt that rule, or you adopt another rule",
QUESTION:

In other administrative agencies, when

they have some authority to take into consideration comeptitive
considerations, you have a hearing and you get the — somebody
has a chance to present to you, the agency, some of the
competitive considerations®

None here,

Zero®

And yet in «° and you say it’s reviewable? would it
be reviewable on an administrative record or just in a new
lawsuit, or what?
MR® NERHEIM:

it would be review able in a district

court. Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Who would you sue?

MR, NERHEIM:
QUESTIONS

Well, we wouldn’t sue anyone, but —
I know, but who would —

MR, NERHEIMs

Well, Mr. Bader would sue us, as he

has before; testing our jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

Well, as I understood him, he was told

about six times that it wasn't reviewable,
MR. NERHEIM: Well, it isn’t quite that bad, Mr®
Justice

65
QUESTION:

Maybe you could give him some advice

here, how to do it.
MR. NEHSIEXM:
QUESTION:

Yes, I*d like to.

The last time —

Right now.

MR. NERHEIMr

I would give the same advice we gave

him in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1974, the last
time he sued, where he brought just such an action, testing
the agency's non-disapproval of an Exchange rule.

And he

brought a direct appeal in the Second Circuit under 25(a)
of the Exchange Act, which calls for direct appeal in the
Circuit Courts for appeals of orders,
QUESTION:

Is that a de novo thing?

Can you make a

new record there, or are you stuck with your record?
MR. NEHHEIM:

You*ire stuck with your record.

But

the —
QUESTION:

Which is only the rule here.

A letter

came in and gave you the rule, and that's it,
MR. NERHEIM: Well, but the point, Mr, Justice, is
this:

that in that case we suggested to the Second Circuit

that this was not an order, just as the Third Circuit found
in the PBV7 case, that our rule was not an order within the
meaning of Section 25 of the Exchange Act.

And we suggested

to the Court that Mr. Bader had an action in the district
court on the basis of agency action, which he did not pursue.
He did not then go to the district court.

66
QUESTION $
evidence?

Could he — in your view, oould he present

Could there be an evidentiary hearing in the district

court or not?
MR, NERHEXMs

Under that circumstance I would say

yes,
QUESTION* Well, the Administrative Procedure Act
provides, doesn’t it, that if there has been no record made
in the agency, you’re permitted to make one in the district
court?
MR, NERHEIM*

I believe it does, Mr, Justice, and

of course if the record consisted of a rule proposal, and a
non-disapproval, there wouldn’t be much of a record, and I
think in that case there would have to be a record, and l‘*m
sure that the Department of Justice would be an active partied*»
pant in that hearing,
QUESTIONi

So he isn’t stuck with the record before

the agency?
MR, NERHEIM*

I would not believe so in that case,

no,
I just wanted to conclude that part of my remarks by
saying that in the PBW case in the Third Circuit, 1973, and in
the Independent Broker-Dealer case in 1971, in the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, those two
Circuits analyzed exactly how this regulatory scheme works,
talking about the jurisdiction, how these informal assortment

67
of regulatory tools are Intended to operate, and both
concluded that is the way the Exchange Act is intended to work,
and the agency should not be required to resort to formal
hearings, mandates and orders, unless the Exchange refuses to
cooperate.
And that, we believe, is what happened in this case,
and that’s what w© have before us,
I’d also like to say that we believe that the record
in this case is replete with example after example of what
the SEC has been doing in this situation, and the Department
of Justice’s reply brief, at page 6, which was filed on
Saturday, that suggests that the SEC has done nothing with
respect to the practice of fixed-commission rates until
September 1973, but merely tolerated the practice, is, we
believe, shockingly disingenuous.
The last point gets to the issue of plain
repugnancy, and as I’ve indicated this Court had that question
before it in Silver and analyzed the Commission’s regulatory
jurisdiction again more thoroughly in Ware, where there Mr,
Justice Blackmun, speaking for a unanimous Court, said that
these kinds of measures and rules by Exchanges, authorised
by the Commission, are designed to insure fair dealing and to
protect investors, and are the kind directly related to the
Act’s purposes.
And we believe that we’re talking about an essential

68
ingredient in the Exchange Act in this case»

And in Silver»

which was a particular enforcement of an Exchange rule, this
Court spent five pages of its opinion reciting rule after
rule after rule over the Exchange, every one of which was anti­
competitive, and then said that those rules were designed to
meet the standards of the Act, but that there would be no
repealer in that case, because the SEC didn't have jurisdiction
over the particular enforcement of that situation»
But that a different case would be presented when
this Court was faced with a rule over which the SEC does have
jurisdiction; and if there was ever a classic "different case"
we believe that this is that case»
QUESTION:

New, your brothers on the other side

of the rostrum take a good deal of comfort from the Ricci case,
saying that that answered the question left unanswered in
Silver.
What do you have to say on that?
MR, NERIIEIM*

Yes, they do, and we think they have

misread Ricci, Mr, Justice»

Ricci involved the withdrawal of

a membership on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and this
Court's opinion said that there were facts that had to be
resolved in that dispute, had Ricci voluntarily given up his
membership, did Siegal have a lien on his shares, did Ricci
owe Siegal brokerage fees, and was the withdrawal of the
membership, or the taking away of the membership consistent

69

with the valid rule of the Exchange,
It said this is something that should be sent to the
Commodity Exchange Authority for a decision on the facts»
and after the facts are in, we will decide if there is an
implied repealer.
Because if the membership was taken away pursuant to
an invalid rule, or taken away improperly, then the implied
repealer question goes away, the antitrust case should proceeds
But if it was taken away from him
QUESTION*

V7ell, contrary to a valid rule, say?

MR* NERHEIMs

Then the antitrust court action

proceeds,
QUESTION*

Right,

MR, NERIIEIM*

And as the Chief Justice indicated

in that case, the Silver case was clearly not before it in
Ricci, and we agree.
We think this is — we believe this is a situation
where the district court properly applied Silver,

We believe

that the Second Circuit properly applies Silver» and we
respectfully urge this Court to affirm the lower court*
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
Nerheim.
Mr, Bader,

Thank you, Mr,

70
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP I. WALTON BADER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BADER*

May it please Your Honors*

May I first point out to the Court that based upon
everything that has been said here, it is my feeling and
belief that in fact the record in this case before this Court
is completely inadequate to make a proper determination.
And I think that really what should be done in this
catae is to send this back to the district court for a full and
complete trial.
Because there is the question of the antitrust
immunity involved, the position of the Stock Exchange, the
position of the SEC are completely different.
Interestingly enough, Mr. Nerheim now tells me that
if I had started a district court action against the SEC in
connection with the Stock Exhcnaga rules, that that district
court action would not have been subject to a motion to dismiss.
But we did start such an action.

It was Civil Action

1984-71 in the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia, and, as pointed out on page 6 of my brief, the
SEC did make a motion to dismiss on the ground that the district
court had no jurisdiction.

That motion was granted.

Now, perhaps the SEC is taking a different view at
this point, but I don#t think that a plaintiff in this case
should have to come all the way up to the Supreme Court to

obtain a change in the rule,
She fact remains that the procedures that the SEC
has for the review of their so-called non-objection to Stock
Exchange rules are now, are basically not reviewable by any
court, and if you try the Circuit Court you're held — you're
dismissed on the ground that it's not in order? if you try
the district court, you're dismissed on the ground that there
are other considerations involved, which make that inappro­
priate.
And I submit that without a consistent means for
the public to proceed in any of these agency determinations,
that, as a practical matter, such an agency determination
could not repeal the antitrust laws? and, as a matter of fact,
there might be some serious due process violations involved
as wall.
Now, basically, as far as this Court had determined
under the Silver case, it seems that the exemption in each
case has to be considered under the facts that are involved
in the particular case.
And under the facts that are involved in this
particular case, I submit to the Court that if the record is
considered by the Court to be complete, that there is no
such implied exemption of the antitrust laws,
I point out, for example, that, let us assume that
the Stock Exchange provided for a rule which is similar to what

72
I believe Mr. Justice Stewart mentioned# that# let us say#
the rule provided for a division of markets,

And we*11 assume

that the SEC does 'not object to that rule# for one reason or
another.
Is the position of the defendant now in this case that
such a clear violation of the antitrust laws would now be
insulated?
Or# let us go to something else# let us suppose that
the SEC has a rule now abolishing fixed**commission rates# as
they do.
Two Exchange marchers get together now and go ahead
and determine that they are going to fix
regardless.

commission rates

Mr. Herheim has said# and Mr. Jackson has said#

quite correctly# that that would not be exempt from the anti­
trust laws.
However# since this is now a violation of the SEC
Act# we are now met with the situation where there are a number
of cases holding that if you sue under antitrust grounds for a
violation of the SEC Act# that at that point you*re only
entitled to single damages and not triple damages.
So that what I*m pointing out to the Court is that
you're ending up into a plethora of problems.

The proper

regulatory scheme# as the plaintiff submits# and I believe
Justice submits# is that any particular regulatory scheme
which is tended to be a claimed exemption from the antitrust

73

laws must be considered in each individual case*
Now* it actually happens that in so far as fixedcommission rates there has been no significant agency action
taken in this case, except now, after some 41 years.
Now, furthermore, the SEC grants any of their
requests that are made or files a Rule 19b request, there is
no public participation in such request.
Now, to say that that can now be reviewed by a
member of the public now coming in and bringing a suit in
the district court and getting into a full-dress trial v?ould
belie the entile administrative process,,

This means now that

there is no way to come before the SEC first, and say to
the SECs

Gentlemen, this rule that is being proposed has

serious anti-competitive effects.
The normal rule of exhaustion of administrative
remedies, it would seem to me, would be completely violated
by permitting such a procedure? and since there is no
mechanism for public participation in connection with such a
rule, it seems to me that such a statutory scheme cannot be
held to be regulatory authority in violation — immune from
the antitrust laws.
As a matter of fact, this is precisely what Otter
Tall held, and it seems to me that this case is almost
directly analogous to Otter Tail,
XT- ~ZZ'Se.'**Z-=?

Also, I point out to the Court that there has been

74
never any SEC order of any kind ordering any fixed-commission
rates.

The only SEC order that has been mad© has been the

order now that fixed-commission rates shall be phased out.
Now* let us suppose that the SEC now determines*
after* let us say* the 1st of June or the 1st of July* that
fixed — that unblocked rates have not worked out* and the
Stock Exchange now presents a proposal for fixed rates.
The SEC now goes ahead and permits that fixed-rate
order to go in without any review* without any hearing* without
anything of that sort going on.
Now* the — I* as a member of the public, do not have
any right to make ray views known to the SEC.

1 must now go

ahead to the district court of the District of Columbia* bring
an action with respect to this* and I have the entire burden
on myself of a full-dress trial with the SEC no longer in a
position where I am attempting to convince a regulatory agency
to take certain action* but as an adversary to the regulatory
agency.
And Z submit that that is not the proper regulatory
practice.
I thank the Court for its consideration,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you* gentlemen,

The case is submitted.
^Whereupon* at 10$46 o’clock* a.m,* the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,1
