ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. JONES

%

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This case is a consolidated proceeding that
resembles in several respects each of the two immediately
preceding tidelands cases.
Like United States y._ Haine, this case presents
the broad constitutional question whether the separate Coastal
States have the constitutional right, wholly independent or
the. Submerged Lands Act, to exploit the resources of the
Outer Continental Shelf.
And like United^States v.Louisiana, in which
argument was heard yesterday, this case presents a number of
narrower statutory questions pertaining to the application or
the Submerged Lands Act to a particular coastal area.
Although the preceding arguments have discussed at
some length the history' of tide lands litigation in this
Court, I think that in ord r to put this case in context, it
would be helpful, bv:i ’fly, to recapitulate that history here.
The history of tidelands litigation has two strands;

4
one constitutional and one statutory.

Both of those strands

are interwoven in this case,
The constitutional strand begins with this Court’s
decision in United States v. California, in which it was held
that the United States and not the separate Coastal States
had the right to exploit the seabed resources of the three-mile
marginal sea.
That principle of federal maritime paramountcy was
confirmed and extended to the Outer Continental Shelf in this
Court’s decisions in the Louisiana and Texas cases,, 339 U*S.
Shortly after those decisions, Congress enacted the
Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,
in which it allotted the seabed rights of the Territorial Sea,
generally speaking, to the separate Coastal States, and the
seabed of 'the Outer Continental Shelf to the United States»
The Atlantic Coast States, including the State of
Florida, now claim that they have a constitutional right to
all of the seabed rights of the Outer Continental Shelf, and
that the principle of federal maritime paramountcy announced
by this Court in California was wrong»
They claim that the Submerged Lands Act and the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are unconstitutional, in so
far as they deny the States the right to exploit the resources
of the Outer Continental Shelf.
However, the other Atlantic Coast States base their

claim on British maritime history and Colonial maritime
history* as we have just seen.
The State of Florida* however* bases its claim not
on such history but rather upon its 1868 constitutional
boundary.

Since the claims of Florida were so different from

those of the other Atlantic Coast States, this case was
severed from that of United States v. Maine and tried
separately before 'the Special Master.
That is the background of what might be called the
constitutional aspect of this case.
The statutory aspect cf the case derives from tills
Court’s decision in United States y. Florida* 363 U.S.* 121*
that the State is entitled* under -the Submerged Lands Act*
to the seabed rights within its historic

boundary in the

Gulf of Mexico, out to a maximum of three marine leagues from
the coastline.
Since the State is only entitled to three miles and
not three leagues in the Atlantic Ocean* this Court retained
jurisdiction to determine the location of the line separating
the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico* and also to
define the State’s coastline in the Gulf.
Those statutory issues were consolidated with the
constitutional issue and tried together before the Special
Master.
The Special Master rejected Florida's constitutional

6

claim as incompatible with this Court’s decisions in the
California, Louisiana, and Texas cases* and concluded that the
State is entitled only to those seabed rights granted in the
Submerged Lands Act.
The Special Master defined the line separating the
Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico as a line running due
north from Cuba to the Dry Tortugas Islands, the outer islands
of fbe chain of keys, and then following along the outer
curve of the Keys up to the mainland.
He then held that the State was entitled to seabed
rights out to three miles to the east of the mainland and south
of the Keys, and to three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico north
of the Keys and west of the mainland.
QUESTION?
MR. JONESs

Where is Key Biscayne in that ■—
Key Biscayae is not on this map, it’s

approximately here [indicating]; Key Biscayna is just south of
Miami Beach.

This map, I might say, is --

QUESTION:

It’s really almost part of the. mainland,

I take i t?
MR. JONES:

This map is a trifle misleading.

This

body of land is in fact Key Largo, which is a separate island?
but it’s separated from the mainland by only a very narrow
stream of water.

It’s so narrow that it was impractical to

represent it on the map.

But it runs right along here

[indicating]; so that the mainland in fact would run in that

manner.
Thus the principle question disputed before the
Special Master was the location of the cocistline in this area
north of the Keys.

And the Special Master

the State had

contended that a line running from the Dry Tortugas up to
Cape Romano on the mainland marked the seaward limit of its
inland waters; it claimed this large, roughly semi-circular
body of comparatively deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico was
in fact a historic bay, and therefore inland waters of the
State.
QUESTION;

Mr. Jonas, what would be the approximate

length of a line, a straight line drawn from the Dry Tortugas
to Cape Romano?
MR. JONES;
of about 100 miles.
QUESTION;

I think it's .in — it’s in the nature
The scale, as you can see, is 30 miles.
Nautical miles?

MR. JONES; Thirty nautical miles.
QUE STION:

Unh-hunh.

MR, JONES;

So it looks like roughly 100 nautical

miles.
The Special Master rejected that contention of the
State, but held sua sponte that the eastern portion of the
bay, marked by a line running from Knight Key up to the main­
land, the East Cape of Cape Sable, was a juridical bay, that
line is approximately 24 geographic miles, actually a little

8

bit more than 24 miles.
The Special Master also held sua sponte that the
outer islands, the Tortugas, the Marquesas, and the lower
Florida Keys should be encircled by base lines, and he
denominated the waters within the base line so described as
inland waters of the State»
The State here excepts to

virtually every one of the

Special Master's major determinations, the United States
excepts only to the use of closing lines and base lines in
the area of the Florida Bay and the outer islands to measure
the Submerged Lands Act grant and mark the inland waters of
the State»
I turn now to discussion of the exceptions made by
the parties, and I will take up first the issue that this case
has in common with United States v, Maine, that is the broad
constitutional question of whether the State possesses a
right to exploit the resources of the Outer Continental
Shelf without regard to any limits imposed by the Submerged
Lands Act.
The other Atlantic Coast States, in the United States
v. Maine, claimed the entire Outer Continental Shelf-»

If this

Court should, contrary to our submissions in that case, decide
to overrule the California decision and decide the case in
favor of the States, Florida presumably will advance a similar
claim to 'the Outer Continental Shelf under the equal footing

doctrine.

But any issues under the equal footing doctrina are

not presented here.
Florida# in this litigation# claims not the entire
Continental Shelf# but only that portion of it within its
historic maritime boundary.
That boundary, even under the State's rather generous
description# encompasses considerably less than the entire
Continental Shelf.
The historic boundary upon which
QUESTIONi

In distance seaward# how much less?

MR. JONES:

Pardon?

QUESTION?

Distance seaward# hew much less?

MR. JONES:

Well# the Continental Shelf varies in

width from as little as six miles to as much as# I think#
200 miles.

Their historic maritime boundary# even given the

most generous description of it# would not, I think# extend
more than 30 miles offshore at any point.
So that# at least at some portions of the coast# it
would be considerably less than the entire Outer Continental
Shelf.
As I say# the historic boundary upon which the State
relies is that set forth in its 1068 Constitution.
There was a good deal of argument before the Special
Master as to the actual location of -chat boundary line# and
I do not propose to renew that argument here.

It's discussed

10

at length in the Special Master's Opinion and in our brief,
and 1 rely upon that discussion here.
One reason I don't discuss the actual location of
the boundary is that in the view we take of this case the
State's historic boundary is largely irrelevant to the proper
allocation of seabed rights as between the State and United
States.
I would, say* however, that both parties agree that
at least one point along the coast,

the area of water between

the Marquesas Keys and the Dry Torfcugas, the State's historic
boundary did extend beyond the maximum limits of the Submerged
Lands Act.
So that, even under the more restrictive view we
take of the State's historic boundary, they would, if this
Court decided the constitutional issue in their favor, be
entitled to some seabed rights in addition to those granted
under the Act.
But that fact, we think, does not prevail in Florida
here.
In tine first place, this case is foreclosed, the
State's constitutional claim is foreclosed by the California
decision.

This case is on all fours with California.
Like Florida, California had a maritime boundary'' that

had been approved by Congress.

This Court held that that

congressional approval of the boundary authorized the State to

II
exercise certain local police power functions in the area of
the marginal sea, encompassed by its historic boundary? but
that those functions did not detract, from the federal governmeat's paramount, rights and power over that area.
The Court reasoned that the United States had
acquired the seabed rights, or had acquired the marginal sea
in the exercise of its foreign affairs and defense powers,
and therefore that the United States and not the separate
Coastal States were entitled to the seabed rights within that
marginal sea.
The Solicitor General in the preceding case has set
forth our reasons why this Court should adhere to its
California decision, and I will not elaborate upon that
ar gurnen t he re,
My only point is that if this Court does adhere to
its California decision, nothing more need be said with
regard to Florida's constitutional claim.
But even if this Court did depart from its
consistent pattern of tidelands decisions and overruled
California in tine principle of federal maritime paramountcy
for which it stands,

Florida's claim would still have to foe

rejected.
The reason for that is that in 1962, after enactment
of the Submerged Lands Act, the State formally relinquished by
constitutional amendment any claim it might otherwise have

12

had to seabed rights seaward of the maximum limits of the
Submerged Lands ActThat 19G2 constitutional amendment replaced
Florida's 1868 boundary, on which it relies here, with a more
clearly defined boundary that corresponds precisely with the
maximum limit of its Submerged Lands Acre grant.
That new boundary would mark the outer limit of any
permissible constitutional claim, other than under the equal
footing doctrine, that Florida could make.
Thus

,

there is no theory of law in this case under

which Florida's claim could be sustained.
I therefore turn to questions relating to the
application of the Submerged Lands Act to the facts oi; this
case.
The first of these questions might be stated ass
Where is the Gulf of Mexico?

Or, more precisely:

What .is

the line separating the Gulf of Mexico from the Atlantic
Ocean, for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act?
■There's really very little to be said on this
question, because the evidence is essentially all on the
federal government's side.
It's true that Congress in enacting the Submerged
Lands Act did not purport to define those two bodies of water.
There's nothing in the legislative history that suggests what
Congress intended.

But cartographers, geographersf explorers, historians
and other writers have all agreed that the line running due
north from Cuba to the Dry Tortugas, and from there following
the outer curve of the Keys to the mainland, is the maritime
border between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.
That is the line set by the International Hydro­
graphic Bureau, that is -the line fixed by all geographers and
cartographers, as the evidence before the Special Master
showed? and the State presented absolutely no evidence whatso­
ever that would suggest that Congress intended any other line.
Indeed, shortly after enactment of the Submerged
Lands Act, the Florida Legislature itself, with specific
reference to the Submerged Lands Act, stated in legislation,
that idle Florida Straits — the Straits of Florida there -~
are an arm of the Atlantic Ocean, not of the Gulf of Mexico,
which the State claims here.
It's only when this litigation began that the
Florida Legislature realised that perhaps it had acted
adversely to its own litigating position and revoked that
Act in 1971.
But the Florida Legislature's enactment in 1955 is
clear evidence of the common understanding of where the
dividing line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of
Mexico was when Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act.
QUESTION?

Mr. Jones, what's the lettering right

14
above Straits of Florida?

Does it say Florida Keys?

Is that

'tat that says?
HR. JONESs

Yes

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. JONES; .

t

Florida Keys.

We refer loosely to the Florida Keys

sometimes as the entire chain of islands out to the Dry
Tortugas, and sometimes only tc those islands terminating
here

[indicating]»
QUESTION;

Is that Key West?

MR. JONES;

Key West actually is right here

[indicating]# and these are the Marquesas Keys, and. -then the
Dry Tortugas.
QUESTIONj

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

Of course,, if we decided against you on

the constitutional question# would we have this issue as to
where the Atlantic and the Gulf are?

MR. JONES;

Well# if you decided against the United

States in this case -—•
QUESTION:

Yes# in this case.

MR. JONES:

— the constitutional question# then

you wouldn't have to decide the dividing line between the
Atlantic and the Gulf.

That’s correct.

You would simply make reference to the State’s
historical boundary.

And there's no disagreement between the

State and the Federal Government as to its historic boundary

south of the Keys.
In short, we believe that the Special Master's
determination of the line dividing the two bodies of water,
the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, is firmly grounded
in the evidence and re.f3.ects the common understanding on
which the Submerged Lands Act was based.
The remaining questions in this case all relate to
the definition of Florida's coast line, in the general area
of the Florida Keys.
(Unfolding map]

I haven't had much practice with

this map.
The State claims that 'diis large body of water,
marked by this closing line, is a historic bay and that it is
inland waters of the State.
We believe that it's clear that there's no founda­
tion , either in fact or in law, for that claim.
To -die contrary, the federal government has affirma­
tively and decisively disclaimed any historic title in that
area.

Before this issue even arose in litigation, the

federal government had distributed to foreign governments
maps showing that the United States Territorial Sea, in the
area of the Florida Keys, is measured three miles out from the
natural shore line, and that representation, of course, was
wholly inconsistent with the existence of the historic bay.
The necessary inference of the maps which we distributed was

16

that the United States claimed no historic bay in that area.
We believe that a disclaimer of that kind, a
disclaimer made to foreign governments in advance of any
domestic litigation, should be given preclusive effect.

We

think 'that in the face of that disclaimer, Florida's contrary
claim is barred as a matter of law.
But even if the disclaimer is not given preclusive
effect of that kind, it nevertheless imposes upon the State
the burden of proving its historic title is clear beyond doubt;
a standard applied by this Court in the second California case.
And it's clear that the State's evidence did not meet that
s tandard.
Under this Court's prior decisions, the State would
have had to show three elements to prove its historic title.
It would have had to show that it had mads a claim,
and a long-standing claim; second, it would have had to show
that accompanying that claim had been the continuous assertion
of sovereign authority? and, third, that there had been foreign
acquiescence, express or tacit, in that claim.
The State’s evidence fell far short of making any
of the three necessary showings.
As to. the existence of a claim, the State relied
almost exclusively upon its 1068 constitutional boundary,
but the Special Master found that that boundary in fact did
not run along the line claimed by the State as the seaward

limit of its inland waters,, but rather ran along the inner
perimeter of this area? and that construction, we believe,
is based upon a solid reading of the constitutional language
of Florida’s boundary and upon the evidence of contemporaneous
activities in the area, of the Keys adduced before the Special
Master»
The reasons we would present for supporting that
boundary are set forth in our brief, and also in the Special
Master's report? and 1 do not repeat them here.
Suffice it to say that if this -- if that construc­
tion is accepted, Florida's claim of a historic title is
necessarily defeated.
Moreover, we believe that Florida's evidence with
respect to the other two requirements of historic bay was, if
any tiling, weaker.

That evidence again is recounted in the

Special Master's report and in our briefs in this case.

And

I won't repeat it here.
I will only point out that the United States did
clearly establish before the Special Master, and the State
concedes here in its brief, at page 48 of its opening brief,
that foreign ships have fished, do fish, historically have
fished and do fish in the Florida Bay, without any interference
whatsoever by the State of Florida.
QUESTIONs

Didn't Governor Kirk send the Florida

Navy cut once a few years ago to accost some foreign fishermen?

18

MR, JONES:

He raay have, but any such excursion was

unsuccessful, as the State itself recognizes? they testified
that they had never attempted to interfere with foreign
fishing in the Florida Bay.
The Governor may have threatened to do that.

That

threat may have been made in connection with this litigation.
Nevertheless, -there has been no active interference
with foreign fishing in the Florida Bay# and that fishing
continues to this day.
Certainly there has been no foreign acquiescence in
any claim.

Governor Kirk’s announcement# at most, would have

shown that there was a claim made in the 1960's, not
sufficiently ancient to show historic title.
That disposes# we believe, of •'die State's historic
claim in tin is case,
I will now turn to the status of the easternmost
portion of that bay# which we feel requires a somewhat more
complex analysis«
Florida did not contend before the Special Master
that the easternmost portion of the bay was a juridical bay,
and almost no evidence was introduced before the Special
Master on that point.
The Special Master, nevertheless, found that a
portion of Florida Bay, which I will demonstrate by this piece
of red tape or the map [demonstrating]; that the portion of the

13

bay east of that red line constitutes a juridical bay, and
therefore inland waters of the State.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Jones, on the maps of the area, you

have ~~ are they similar to your designation theres

MR. JONES:

The official- maps?

I frankly don't know,

I gather that the designation

"Florida Bay" is rather loosely used.

And I don't think that

there's any particular outward limit expressed.
The Graphics Department of the Justice Department
did this map, and simply put the designation "Florida Bay"
in to make it more understandable for the Court.

You’ve led away the easternmost part there.
MR. JONES:

Opposite page 04 of the Special Master's

Opinion is a map in which the phrase "Florida Bay" appears
immediately to the east, of the line drawn by the Special Master.
And whether the line drawn by the Special Master or
one further seaward might have been intended by that designa­
tion is, of course, unclear.
The problem, of course, is that Florida Bay, as such,
has no official meaning and no —

'The solid connected line on

that map represents the Territorial Sea, and the dotted line,

by the Special Master.
As you can see, it’s seaward in some places of
the Territorial Sea.

And it thereby encloses part of the

high seas.
QUESTION:

When you say Territorial Sea with

reference to that map you’re just talking about, just what

HR. JONES;

Well, it is, it’s three miles from

islands within the eastern portion of the bay.

Some of those

islands may be so small that they don’t show up on the map.
Indeed, some of them may be areas of land that's covered at
high tide.
Nevertheless, that is the'three-mile zone drawn from

MR. JONES:

Yes, in tha Special Master's Report.

I think that the line drawn by the Special Master
is, at all points, within six miles of the natural shore line.
QUESTION;

And the government’s submission is that

it should net be more than three miles?

Under the government’s position, it

should be no juridical bay.

MR, JONES:

That’s right, it’s not entirely accurate.

Let me amend that.
The Special Master’s closing line of the juridical

24
bay at, at most, about six miles from the natural shore line.
But then the Territorial Sea would be -three miles further
seaward of that line.
So — a little less than nine miles, perhaps,
QUESTION: Right.
MR» JONES:

For reasons I will discuss in a moment,

we believe that the Special Master’s finding of the juridical
bay was erroneous.
But, before discussing that point, I wish to draw
the Court’s attention to the fundamental and clear legal error
tot the Special Master made in drawing the Submerged Lands Actgrant from idie juridical bay closing line.
In our view, that line, that grant has to be drawn
from the natural shore line of the State.
Now, we rely here upon this Court’s holding in
United States v. Louisiana, 389 U.S. 155 [sic], that historic
boundaries that are measured from the coast, line, such as
Florida's boundary in this area, must be measured for
Submerged Lands Act purposes from the historic coast line.
And it is clear that this juridical bay closing line
is not the historic coast line.
QUESTION:

You’re referring — you say that Louisiana

at 389, do you mean 339?
MR. JONES:

No, 389 ~

And you say that's generally true, or

just because of Florida?
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

No#only in this case —
I had the understanding that generally

you would measure the marginal sea from the outer- line of a.
j uridical bay.
MR. JONES;

That’s correct.

But here we’re saying

that the Submerged Lands Act is only measured from historical
coast line# when you’re measuring it by reference to historic
boundary,
And I will go -~
QUESTION;

So you think under the Submerged Lands

Act that at times you do measure from the historic boundary?

There's just no question about it.

MR. JONES

If there's —

You would measure it from the current,

line is roughly 24 miles.

This closing

Actually a little longer, and

therefore invalid under the Convention.
But prior to 1961, this nation recognized,
ten-mile closing lines for juridical bays.

at most,

And in the
i

Nineteenth Century they recognised only two-marine-league
closing lines.

A closing line of that length would make the

juridical bay approximately in that area [indicating on map].
How, the historic coast line would not be defined by
reference to any closing line such as that, but by reference
to 'the natural shore lines of the islands lying to the west,
of that closing line in the Florida Bay.
And our submission here is that the State's
Submerged Lands Act grant must be measured by reference to

28
its historic boundary, which in. turn is measured by reference
to the historic coast line, and not to any new modern juridical
bay closing line.
QUESTION:

Let me see if I get this, Mr. Jones.

I

now have that Louisiana case in 389, that's Mr. Justice Black
wrote this one.

That's correct.
In other words, that's what we’re dealing

with here, isn't it?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
— must be measured by the boundary which

existed in 1845, when Texas entered the Union, and cannot
be measured from artificial

jetties built long thereafter.

Now, you apply that principle here, how, to say that

It must be measured by reference to the

the Louisiana boundary case?
— the Submerged Lands Act only permits

the State three leagues within the Gulf of Mexico, within

So you have to fix the historic

at that time.
The principles of law at that time would not have
permitted a juridical bay closing line of this kind.

You

would have had to measure the coast line, therefore, by
reference to the natural shore line of the islands, and
measure the historic boundary from that natural shore line,
QUESTION:

But you're allowing Mr, Claiborne —

pardon me, Chief.
QUESTION:

But the line that you just put cn in

red with some crayon, is that based on the 1068 boundaries?

That would have been —
Would you indicate that one again for me?

So that it's clear.
That's based on —
MR. JONES;

All that —

QUESTION;

That's based on the '1.868, is that right?

MR. JONES;

All that line represents is the maximum

juridical bay closing line that, wouldhave been permitted in
1868,

It does not represent the historic coast line, because

there are islands further west of that line, so that historic
coast line would have been the natural shore line of those
island further to the west.
QUESTION:

Your colleague, Mr. Claiborne,yesterday

was talking to us about

Ascension Bay, and I

got the impres­

sion that the thing we were arguing about there was what is
the equivalent of the low-water mark for purposes of measuring
the grant under the Submerged Lands Act.
Special Master's finding,.

And that if the

that it was a juridical bay,

were upheld, we would measure from -the mouth,' from the line
of the bay.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Right.
Is Louisiana different from Florida in

this regard?
MR. JONES;

Well, unfortunately, I'm not sufficiently

31

versed in the detail of the Louisiana case to be able to answer
that.

But it. — I think that ~ well, I can't remember now

which bay was historic and which was juridical.
Any historic bay,, of course, would be the historic
coast line.
Now, — oh, I'm sorry.
In Louisiana, you're only measuring three miles out
from the current coast line.

Because Louisiana has not

established a historic boundary.
Therefore, you have to look, in Louisiana, at the
current coast line and measure three miles from that line.
We're here concerned with determining the historic
boundary, which is measured by reference to the historic
coast line.

doesn't it?
MR. JONESs

That's true.

I'm merely showing here that the existence of the
juridical bay is essentially irrelevant to the question of the
Submerged Lands Act.
QUESTION:
the Special Master?
MR, JONES:

Was this -- has tills been argued before
I assume it was.
Not it wasn't, because no one contended

that there was a juridical bay of this kind before the Special
Master.

That determination was made by the Special Master

on his own, without any discussion or evidence.
That's why we're having this difficulty here.

QUESTION; Was there any reason you didn't go back

to the Master and ask him to reconsider it?
MR. JONESs

Well# the Special Master submitted the

report to the Court# and as a procedural matter# I suppose we
were unsure whether we could in fact go back to the Special
Master# at that time.
Because the report was then before this Court.
QUESTION;

Well# when you say sua sponte# the

Master's job was to answer some of -these questions besides
whether there was juridical bay# as I presume; and did he have
to have a brief on each point from the parties before he could
draw a single line, on the 'trap?
MR. JONESs

Well# I suppose he wouldn't have to#

he didn't have a brief.

What we're saying is that if we had

been able to make these arguments before the Special Master#
we're certain he wouldn't have found a juridical bay*
I would make just one point — my time is running
short

about the juridical bay.
He's used a chain of islands as the defining

coast line of that bay.

That use of islands is impermissible

under the *•Convention on the Territorial Sea.

The islands are

separated by water gaps of more than one mile in width# which
are navigation channels through -die Keys.

They're not

assimilable to the mainland.

That is a historic bay. not a juridical

The principles are different.

upon the technical

A juridical bay relies

technicalities of the Convention on the

Territorial Sea, which were not met in this case.
I'd like to pass on quickly to the last exception
of the United States , which is the use of closing lines in
the three groups of outer islands.

And 1 will illustrate that

by reference to the Dry Tortugas Islands, which are here on
this map [indicating],

Although the principles of law are

basically the same with regard to all of the islands.
The Special Master drew these closing lines to
enclose inland waters of the State.

The effect of that was to

deny foreign navigators, foreign vessels the right to sail
through those waters, and they were designated inland waters
of the State.
That use of base lines ---- well, the Special Master
had no jurisdiction to use base lines in this fashion.

As

this Court has recognized in the Louisiana boundary case, the
use of such base lines is within the sole discretion of the.
United States.

The United States has not chosen to enclose

outer islands with base lines, and the Special Master had no
power to do it.
Moreover, the use of such base lines is inconsistent
with our position in foreign affairs,
Certain island nations, Indonesia and the Philippines

36
for example, have enclosed large bodies of water with the use
of such base lines, and threatened to deny foreign navigation
• ^

rights through these waters.
QUESTION:

I take it what the Special Master has

concluded is that that's the boundary of the State,
MR. JONES:

That’s correct.

QUESTION: And if the islands were very close together
and iraperceptably apart, you would think that would be quite
all right?
MR, JONESs

Yes, but these islands are not that

close together.
But, more than that, only if they're close to the
mainland, not if they're just close together.
Islands that are merely close together are not
entitled to base lines unless the sovereign determines to
draw such base lines.
QUESTIONS

But you — would you say that this was

there all the way up the Keys, for the south side of Florida
Bay?
MR. JONES:

No, we*re only speaking now of 'the lower

Florida Keys, the Marquesas Keys and the Dry Tortugas.
QUESTION:

Why aren’t you speaking — why don't you

take this same position on up through the Keys?
MR. JONES:
way.

He didn't encircle those in the same

He did form a juridical bay there when he enclosed that.

37

QUESTIONs

But he did that, and the Keys do form

the south side of a supposed juridical bay.
MR. JONESs

That's correct, and —

QUESTION: Do you challenge that?
MR. JONES;

Certainly.

We say that there’s no

juridical bay there.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but do you challenge it

on the grounds that the islands themselves are not part of the
mainland and should not therefore

— do not therefore bound

the bay?
MR. JONES:

That’s right, the islands are not

assimilable to the mainland.

They're separated from the main­

land by a series of water gaps, some of which are more than
one mile in width, some of which are navigation channels»
They are simply not a part of the mainland.
The only time this Court has permitted the
assimilation of islands to the mainland was in the
boundary case, where there were very marshy areas, riddled
with very thin, impassable streams of water, where it was
impossible, for practical purposes, to define, the difference
between the mainland and the islands.
That’s simply not the case here.

These are true

islands, separated at some great distance from the mainland.
QUESTION:

I suppose, if you followed your course,

you would just go out three miles from the actual coast line

38

of each of those islands?
MR. JONES:

i7e.ll, -three miles to determine the

Territorial Sea.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That’s right.
Yes»

Our position is that the coast line

of the State is determined solely by reference to the natural
shore line of the mainland and the islands, and that all
grants under the Submerged Lands Act must be measured from the
natural shore line, and that the Territorial Sea is measured
from the natural shore line, and that there are no substantial
bodies of inland water in the area of the Keys,,
QUESTION:

What if the Florida Keys, instead of

running southwest, ran from northeast to southwest, ran from
Key Biscayne southeast, so that there could be no question of a
juridical bay at all, but they were still separated by the
same water that they now are, between Key Biscayne and Key West?
MR. JONES:

Well —

QUESTION: Would you say there -that the

Master

couldn't draw base lines?
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Yes.
Yes,

Certainly as to islands that are

sufficiently separated from the mainland, not to be assimilable
to the mainland.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

How about these particular islands?
In our brief we suggested that the

islands down to Upper Hate cumbe Bay — Upper Iiatecurn.be Key,
might be so closely assimilated to the mainland to be part of
it.
Those islands, which I'll illustrate on the map,
are separated from the mainland only by impassable ribbons of
i^ater.
[Indicating on map]
to this point.

I'm here discussing only down

In fact, on this map, it appears that this is
I

part of the mainland.

It’s not, it's a series of Keys, some

large, some smaller, which really are so closely connected to
the mainland, or so close to the mainland as, for practical
purposes, probably to be part of the mainland.
At tills point, between Upper Hate cumbe Key and the
Keys further to the southwest, there are water gaps which are
wide enough, sone over a mile in width, to completely
separata those islands, in our view, from the mainland, and
to make it impermissible to draw base lines.
But I would further add that the base line running
down along a chain of islands would serve no purpose at all.
It would not enclose any body of water.
passage between the islands.

It would simply deny

That would serva no legitimate

interest of the State, and it would interfere with foreign
navigation in some instances, with no counterveiling considera­
tions .in its favor.
That’s the problem with the base .lines drawn by the

Special Has ter i-n the outer islands.
in his report.

It serves no purposes

Florida's grant under the Submerged Lands Act

would be essentially the same, whether they use base lines or
not, and they are merely gratuitous in this case.
QUESTION: This is another question that was not
argued before the Special Master?
MR. JONES;

That's correct.

No one made any

submissions about base lines of this kind.
It was assumed by the federal government, and the
State made no contrary contentions, that there would be no
such base lines.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. SHEVIN, ESOs ,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. SIIEVIN:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
First of all, the water gaps that Mr. Jones refers
to, of a mile between the Keys, I would point, out. that most of
those are not more than two feet deep.

There are a couple of

six and seven-foot channels, but there was testimony
presented before the Special Master that one could begin
walking at Key Biscayne and walk the entire distance to Key
West during low tide.
So we’re not talking about substantial water gaps
of depth.
Secondly, what counts is what was the historical
setup of this land in 1860.

And tine maps that were presented

in the record indicate that this was one mass of land with
very little separation in 1868; and, as a matter of fact,
there were mud flats from Key Biscayne all the way to Key
West.
I would also point out that what Indonesia and the
Philippines do with regard to their islands is totally
immaterial to this boundary dispute, and we should not be
bound, in a dispute with the federal government, over what
will happen in Indonesia or the Philippines.
QUESTION;

Now, when you made that statement about

walking from Key Biscayne to Key West, assuming you wanted to
take that long a walk, is that in evidence in the Master's
record?
MR. SHEVIHs
QUESTION;

Yes, it is.
Unh-hunh.

MR. SHEVIHs There is evidence, and we have maps from
the 1700's ill at shov? this entire mass of land and mud flats,
without hardly any separation at all between the Keys.
With regard to the exercise of sovereign power by
the State in Florida Bay, may I remind the government that
in 1964 they supported us in the Barrios case, which came to
this Court, where we prosecuted two Cuban fishermen for the
violation of our State fishing laws, and the government filed
a brief in favor of our exercise of sovereign jurisdiction,
I would also point out, in response to a question
asked by Mr. Justice Powell, that foreign fishing has not been
allowed in the eastern portion of Florida Bay, and it has not
been allowed in this entire portion on a historical basis,
[Indicating on map»]
I would also point out that the 1962 Florida
constitutional amendment, which they refer to as a waiver of
the State's rights, was not approved by the Congress, so
therefore it cannot constitute a waiver.

Florida's historical

boundary in 1068 is our only lawful boundary, because that
was the only boundary approved by the Congress„

44
1 would also point, out that the 1962 amendment to
the Constitution in Florida cannot be any more effective, as
far as hurting us, than the I960 amendment could in helping
us.

Because in the 1968 amendment to the Florida Constitution,

it readopted almost verbatim the 1868 boundary.
So what we’re left with is that the only lawful
boundary of the State of Florida is the 1868 boundary,
With regard to the 1955 statute that was passed by
the State of Florida, which mentioned gratuitously -that the
Straits of Florida were located in the Atlantic rather.than
in the Gulf? and here are the Straits of Florida [indicating
on map].
With regard to that, I would point out that this
statute was passed by the Legislature in response to the
Submerged Lands Act, it certainly cannot affect what is
based on expert testimony, and that is marine geology and
sedimentology.

The testimony is clear that this is a Gulf

area, and that this is the Atlantic [indicating on map]» and
the Gulf and the Atlantic are separated at Cape Florida.

In

effect, the lighthouse at. Cape Florida separates the Gulf and
the Atlantic,

QUESTION; Right.
MR. SHEVINs

It's 25 degrees and 40 minutes, Your

Honor.
QUESTIONS And it's your submission that that is what,
at that point ~~
MR« SIIEVIN:

He are — our contention, Your Honor,

is that the Straits of Florida and. the entire Keys are located
in the Gulf of Mexico.

We have drawn tine line where we

contend the Atlantic and the Gulf separate.
The Master, in his finding, said basically that
everything north of the Tortugas is Gulf, and everything south
is Atlantic.
QUESTION: Right,

And your submission is that an

east-west line, with its westward terminus the Cape of Florida,
is the dividing line between the Gulf and the Atlantic?
MR. SHEVINs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION s Right.
MR. SHEVINs And we contend that the record is clear.
We have sufficient testimony, and I'in going to get into the
testimony, and point

out why the testimony of 'the government

is inadequate on this point.
QUESTION:

Now, before you go on, —

4G
MR. SIIEVIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— would you take your pointer, at least

for me, and show rae where you would draw a north-south line
from the lighthouse you were talking about, that would
separate the Gulf from the Atlantic?
MR. SIIEVIN:

This red line, with the Atlantic here

— excuse me.
QUESTION: wIT you would use your pointer, maybe we
could see over on this side.
MR. SIIEVIN: All right.

This red line —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Can you see now, Mr,

Justice Powell?
[Laughter.} .
MR. SIIEVIN:

Throughout this map the red line

indicates what the State of Florida's position is, the black
line indicates what the Master found, which is pretty con­
sistent with what the government put forth in their case,
with the exception of the juridical bay.
Basically# where we differ -- we differ very
slightly here, and I don't even intend to argue the Atlantic
coast line.

I intend to argue the Atlantic and the Gulf

separation. The question of Florida today, which we contend ~
we agree, we don’t, think it’s a juridical bay: we 'think it's
a historic bay. And we think the historic bay goes on the
45-degree angle from the Tortugas to nine miles, or three

leagues off the coast of Florida.

And we’ll get into than x.n

just a moment.
So, basically, this is the red line which encloses
what we contend is all of Florida Bay, and we will show that
historically we have exercised sovereign jurisdiction over ’that
entire area.

the Gulf go from that line off the lighthouses

Yes, it’s based upon 'the bottom.

with regard to the organisms in that area, and with regard co
the sedimen to logy and the geology of tha*- arse.
I would also point out that the .1955 statute, which
was a response to the Submerged Lands Act, certainly cannot

MR. SIIEVTN: The importance of this case to
Americans living thousands of miles away, we contend# will
*

not be known for a long time# because we think that the impact
of this case will be very great.

Already Florida Bay# which

is the area in question# produces half of our $16 million a year
fishing industry.

At present the area is protected by the

Florida Marine Patrol,
If the Master is upheld# this entire fishery will
become international waters and will probably have no police
protection whatsoever.
We would like to comment that for many years the

51

government has had, we consider, a general policy of trying
to chip away at the rights of the State in our marine areas.
And this policy has taken the form of nibbling away at State
sovereignty*
This case, we think, presents an excellent opportunity
for 'the Court to reverse this trend and to recognize that the
States have a value in being able to give local knowledge and
direct interest in protecting these vital natural resources,
a police force already on line, trained, knowledgeable, and
particularly equipped to patrol this area, and vigorous
enforcement with proper respect for international commitments.
I would point out, Your Honor, that the conduct of
international affairs, Your Honors, is not at issue here..
The rights between the State*3 sovereign and the federal
sovereign are at issue.

There's nothing in the record that

shows that Florida's ownership of Florida Bay, or exercise of
sovereignty in Florida Bay has ever embarrassed or interfered
with the federal government's conduct of foreign affairs.
Time and time again, the Master, we think, wrongly
turned to international law to decide what properly is a
purely municipal matter.
This is a case of domestic law.

It arises, we think,

from a somewhat misguided effort on the part of the federal
Executive to veto Congress by litigation, And I think that the
Court should recognize the usefulness and ’the detrimental

52
effect that the Executive Branch of Government has in spending
great sums of money in this litigation to ask. the Federal
Judiciary to proclaim what the President or the Department of
Justice or the Stats Department feels is best as to where the
boundaries of the State should be located,
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General,, if the large bay ,

that is, the one with the 100-mila opening, the one that you
claim is a historic bay?
MR, SHEVIN: We claim it is a historic bay and we
claim it is — we claim that it is the historic boundary.
QUESTIONS

If that's now open to foreign shipping

and foreign fishing, back to the new line that the Master has
drawn to a very much smaller bay, do you then suggest that that
will open up that whole area to potential conflicts between
the State's efforts to police it, or will the State be
entirely out of policing that large area?
MR. SHEVIN:

Well, if the Master is correct, and

the historic boundary of the State is along in this area
[indicating] , -then we would feel that this entire Florida Bay
area would he considered international waters and that wa
would have no jurisdiction for policing any of that area?
notwithstanding the fact that a great amount of the shrimping
industry in Florida is located in that specific area.
QUESTION:
MR. SHEVINs

What proportion of the total do you —
Of the shipping?

Of the fishing?

53
QUESTION;

Of the fishing.

MR. SHEVIJJ:

About half of the $16 million industry

is located in that area.
We would also point out — and I hope to get to this
at some point in time — the State has issued a number of oil
leases since 1941 in -this entire area, which has never been
questioned before, and large companies have been drilling for
oil in. that entire area over the past 30 to 35 years.
QUESTION;

Mr* Attorney General, the government

doesn’t agree with you that you have permitted or not permitted
fishing, by a foreign government.
MR* SIIEVINs VJell, Your HOnor, we
QUESTIONs

You state it as a fact, but you agree

that that’s not an admitted fact; right?
MR. SKEVIN;

Well, it's not an admitted fact, but I

hope to get into soma of the specific testimony which will
point out that there has been an acquiescence by foreign
governments in the sovereign exercise of jurisdiction by the
State in that entire area, over a long period of time.

from fishing?

QUESTION:

I thought the government said that, in

the record, that Florida admitted that foreign fishing was
going on.

Is that correct or not?
MR, SHEVIN:

I don't think that statement, standing

alone, is correct, no, sir.

I think there have been occasions

of foreign shins going in the area, and wherever possible
the police has tried to exercise its police power to keep them
out.
And there have been a couple of arrests occasionally,
Usually of Cuban fishermen within that area.
There were two arrests back in '71, and the Coast

Guard were called in to assist the local police.
QUESTION; Well, my point is that it isn't as clear
as you make it*
MR. SIIEVINs
States vs. California.

Let me comment, if 1 may, on United
Of course, the overturning of that case

is sought by the States in Original 35.
I agree with them that the case was wrongly decided
in overlooking at least 100 years of case law, and I think
it's fomented great misunderstanding.
But the point that X wish to make with regard to
Florida's case as it relates to California is not so much
that it was wrongly decided, but that it does not apply in
the way the Master used if.
Our question is simply;

Where did Congress permit

Florida to have our boundary in 1068?
Even though Mr, Jones states that this is identical
to California, we disagree with him. They are not identical.
California went off on a summary judgment. There was no evidence
put in the record.

California did not decide where the

historical boundary of California is or was or whether they
had a historical boundary.
Unlike California, Florida has been declared already
an Original Action 9 in 1960 to possess a historic marine
boundary, as described in the 1868 Constitution? in excess of
three* marine miles.

56

Also, it's our position that -the Submerged Lands
Act. by Congress was clearly a response to this Court's
decision in California, and, in effect, vitiated. California»
In the Submerged Lands Act, the Congress confirmed
a quit-claim title to the States to the seabeds beneath the
navigable waters within the State's boundaries and to the
natural resources within such lands and waters up to three
miles, and gave the States the right to prove the existence
of a marine seaward boundary beyond three miles»
QUESTION:
have just advanced

Mr* Attorney General, it seems to me you
several different propositions, and on

your point that California isn't controlling:

In California,

Congress had recognised the -three-mile boundary of California
at the time it was admitted to the Union in 1850, as I recall»
And I take it the government’s position, which the Master
accepted, was that Congress’s recognition of Florida's 1868
boundary was no more and no less than that.
Now, do

you — if you disagree with that, why do

you disagree with it?

It’s one thing to say you want

California overruled, or that the Submerged Lands Act had
changed it; but in so far as arguing that you're not governed

z/

by Florida, why aren’t you?
MR. SHEVIN;

Because we think that the facts in

California are not identical, that it’s a different situation,
that this Court never decided whether California had a historic

57
boundaryAnd in this case you've already ~~ the Court has
decided, in Original 9, that Florida has a historic marine
boundary that gives us rights beyond three miles,

tod

subsequent —" in other worcis, it's our position tha.u

^.\C,

Submerged Lands Act, since it. very clearly states "nothing
shall be taken to prejudice the rights of any State to
establish a boundary beyond three miles'1, and then this -oar*..,
in United states vs« Louisiana,
this Court said;

the 363 II.S. page 1 decision,

It was suggested that Mississippi and

Alabama might claim boundaries six leagues — which of course
is an excess of three — six leagues in the. Gulf because of
similar provisions in the Acts admitting them to tne Jnxon.
He went on to say, and this is Justice Harlan;
was recognized that if the legal existence of such boundaries
could be established, they would clearly entitle- the respective States to Submerged Lands rights to that distance
under an application of the Pollard Rule to the Marginal Sea.
Hence, while a three-mile boundary was expressly
confirmed for all coastal States, the rights of the Gulf
States to prove boundaries in excess of three miles was
preserved.
Novi, surely, in that —
QUESTION:
Lands Act?

Well, that's based, then, on the Submerged

MR. SIIEVIMs

It is saying,, in effect, that the

Submerged Lands Act’s quit-claim to the States confirmed
title but gave the States every right to come in and try to
prove that they have a historical boundary, even if it went
six leagues.
Now,

obviously, this historical boundary that’s

located out in the — the historical boundary that's located
out in the Florida Bay would be in excess of three leagues.
So we are dealing with an area in excess of three leagues.
So it's our contention that we have ownership
interests in the disputed area off of our coast line? it's
our contention that the rule of Pollard's Lease should apply,
and -chat the extent of our jurisdiction was declared xn the
earlier U. 8. vs. Florida decision to be that which we hao xn
1868, as. described in the State Constitution of that, date,
and approved by the Congress•
We're not here contesting war powers? we’re not
here challenging the federal government's right over inter­
state or foreign commerce? we are not questioning who conducts
our international relations.
But that does not mean to.at Florida cannot control
the seabed of its own territories.

Florida should retain

eminent domain over the shores of her territory and of the
submerged lands that are here in question.
We have excepted to several particular points in the

59

Mas ter's finding.
One of these important points regards the location —
thank you; I broke ny pointer*
One of these important points regards the location
of the historical boundary betweenthe

southernmost Key, the

Dry Tortugas, and Cape RomanoI'd like to call your attention to the call in. the
Constitution, and that is;

Prom the Tortugas you go thence

northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the mainland, —
thence northeastwardly to a point three leagues from the
mainland*
Now, the Master has concluded that that’s only a
general over**all direction, and he, in effect, has said that
you first go east, and then you even go southeast before you
start, and you follow a three-fathom line to a northeastwardly
fashion until a point nine nautical miles is reached.
Now, it's our view that this construction is so
illogical and contrary to the plain meaning of the words as
to be ludicrous*
Florida contends that the call "thence northeast­
wardly to a point three leagues from the mainland’’ can only
mean one thing, and that is a specific compass direction,
an absolute heading of 45 degrees.

Because there are no

geographical directions included in the call, such as

go

northeastwardly along the coast”; it doesn’t say 'along the

coast", it says "thence northeastwardly to a point three
leagues from the coast."
The only way that you can go northeastwardly is a
direct compass reading

point, between north and east, it's
of 45 degrees.

Even the government's witness, Dr. DeVorsey,
testified on cross-examination that "northeastwardly" means
45 degrees,, a point between north and east.

And even -the

Special Master himself, Judge Maris, in J^chigan^^vs^o^Ohio,
Original 30, in 1971, interpreted "northeast" as "north 45
degrees east".
But in this case, for some reason, ha went southeast
in order to determine what the historical boundary or the
State of Florida is.
QUESTION;

Might there not be a difference between

northeast and northeastwardly?
MR. SHEVIN;

Hot when it says to go to a point,

Your Honor, it's -—
QUESTION;

Northeast is, as you correctly say, a

very definite course of 45 degrees.

Northeastwardly means

more — about 40 — more or less northeast.
MR, SHEVIN;

Yes, sir.

Except for the fact that on

cross-examination, of the government’s own witness, he
testified that to him that would mean a point between norcn
and east, and he said 45-degree angle.

61
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh-

MR. SKEVIN: And that's what we have contended
throughout these proceedings, that that is the historical
boundary call, and -that the Master has arbitrarily added a
geographical call where none previously existed.
QUESTION5 But at least you think you have to start
out north of east and not south of east?
MR. SITE VIM:

Yes, sir.

This is -- I would point out that this was the
usual course, and there is testimony in the record that
shrimpers, who would turn from -the Tortugas shrimp grounds,
when they wanted to get to the mainland they set a course for
45 degrees, they started across this expanse of water to the
nearest point of the mainland before turning north.
And the point that they invariably reached was Cape
Romano.
QUESTION:

Would the 45-degree call northeast from

the Dry Tortugas bring you right out to Cape Romano?
MR. SHEVIM:

Yes, sir.

It would.

It would bring

you right to Cape Romano.
Shrimpers, we contend, have been doing so for
hundreds of years, and if the Master's version is accepted, the
plain meaning of the words is ignored.
What's more, he reads into the call a meaning
contrary to the clear import of the words, because he draws the

62

boundary not northeastwardly at all, but in a direction
southeastward.^ from the To r tug as .
Further, the call concludes that it gees to a
specific point, that point lying three marine leagues off
the mainland»
to Cape Romano»

Clearly, it requires a straight line 45 degrees
northeastwardly standing alone, without

further references to geographical locations, either as
commencing midpoint or terminal monuments, must mean northeast*
or north 45 degrees east to constitute a definite boundary.
It's the contention of Florida 'that by virtue of
idle Act of 106 8, Congress expressly or impliedly conveyed or
granted to the State (die rights and interest in the title
possessed by -the United States in the area encompassed by
the boundary described in the Florida Constitution in I860,
when Florida was readmitted to the Union.
Which rights include ownership of the submerged lands
and resources of the sea.
Furthermore, the historical boundary in 1368
defines the outer perimeter of an area historically known as
Florida Bay, which' is a historic bay or historic waters,
and thus internal or inland waters of the State of Florida.
The contested area of Florida Bay amounts to about
8,000 square miles.

And this boundary, as I pointed out, is

not only Florida’s historic boundary, but it’s our only lawful
boundary

63
Wow let me address, if I may for a few moments, the
issue of Florida Bay,
We claim that Florida Bay is a historic bay, and thus
inland waters of the State of Florida,

And we construe it to be

all of the waters bounded on -die south by the Florida Keys to
and including the Dry Tortugas, and on the northeast by the
Florida Peninsula, and on the northwest by the Tortugas with a
line running 45 degrees from the Tortugas to Cape Romano.
In determining whether the State has properly
acquired historic titles to maritime area, this Court has sard
•that there are three factors».

The exercise of authority or

sovereignty by either the State or the federal government;
the continuity for a long period of time of that exercise?
and the attitude of foreign States — in other words,
acquiescence by foreign States,
•

'3

In addition, it has been held that a Coastal State
may strengthen its claim by showing that its vital interests
are involved, as ws did in this case.
We contend that we proved our case in all three
respects.

Our claim of historic title is based upon the

occupation of Florida Bay.

The Master, in concluding that we

failed to prove our claim, ignored, we contend, compelling
evidence to the contrary? and we also contend that he held
us' to the wrong burden of proof.
lie said we have to prove it clear beyond doubt.

64
To apply that burden rather than a preponderance
burden was error, and the matter should be, at the very least,
returned to the Master for additional testimony and hearings,
and the application of the correct standard of proof.
The clear-beyond"doubt test in California II can
only be applied to a State in proving its historical claim
where the federal government, by its actions, has made an
effective disclaimer of sovereign jurisdiction in the area.
Here the federal government tried to disclaim, and
they introduced several self-serving declarations, all made
during or within the proximity of the commencement of this
litigation.
And the documents in evidence carry no specific
disclaimer that Florida Bay is a historic

bay.

These purported disclaimers should not incur such
an onerous burden on the State of clear-beyond-doubt.
Also I would point out that the danger zones that
have been established by the federal government in this area
right here [indicating]» these danger zones which only allow
people to enter that area with permission by the United
States Wavy, certainly represents an act of dominiori over
Florida Bay by the federal government, which cannot be ignored.
When the authority is asserted pursuant to a
statute permitting such exercise of power, only in the
Territorial Waters of the United Statesj they establish those

65
danger zones based upon a congressional Act th ci"C allows them
to do so only in the Territorial Waters of the United States,
so they obviously recognize that area as Territorial Waters,
not the High Seas; and it's hard to see how the United States
has disclaimed dominion over the area when they have danger
zones that only allow people to come in on permission from the
United States Navy of approximately 1900 square miles.
QUESTION;

Is your historic bay claim separate from

your historic boundary claim?
MR. SHEVIN!

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; They bring you out the same place, though?
MRo SHEVIN;

Yes, sir; they bring us the same place.

We contend that we have a historic boundary that
goes there.
You could, in the alternative,

find that we have a

historic bay without agreeing that our boundary is where we
contend it is.
QUESTION;

That would be under the International

Convention?
MR. SHEVIN;

That’s right.

Also, with regard to the failure of the federal
government to disclaim any interest in the area, we rely upon
a Treaty of the United States with Cuba in 1957, when Cuba,
agreed to keep its nationals out of the Tortugas shrimp beds,
and we think, this represents active dominion of the United

States to the historic Florida Bay area.
Further, we contend that we have established by a
preponderance of the evidence, we contend we have established
even by a clear-beyend-doubt test that Florida Bay is a
historical bay and that it is thus the inland waters of the
State„
We contend that it’s a historic bay, because we
believe that 'the Dry —
QUESTION:

Mr. Shevin, I don’t understand, if you’re

right on your historic bay argument, why it is you can’t go
from that line nine leagues into the Gulf.

I mean three

leagues into the Gulf.
MR. SHEVIN:

I think that if we’re correct on that

argument, and you don’t agree with us on the establishment
of the boundary that we covet, that we have considered -■ we
considered that question and we felt that since that is the
boundary line and the coast line, that we could not go beyond
that another three leagues.
QUESTION:

And that that’s —

But if it’s an historic bay?

MR. SHEVIN:

Well —

QUESTION:

That’s your coast line, isn’t it?

MR. SHEVIN:

Yes.

That would be our coast line if —

QUESTION: Well, then, you’d measure it three leagues
from that line, wouldn’t you?
MR. SHEVIN:

Well, perhaps. We had not thought that

67

we could get an additional three leagues on top of that#
QUESTIONS The statute wouldn’t allow It? the 1953
law doesn't give you that.
MR# SIIEVINs

I think it gives us either to the

boundary or to the three leagues, whichever .is greater#
QUESTION;
MR. SIIEVINs

That's right.
In this case we get to the boundary

which would be our coast line, and that's the reason that I
think we concluded that we couldn't get an additional three
leagues.
QUESTION?

And I think you're right#

MR. SIIEVINs

All right.

The historic bay

the Dry Tortugas, we contend,

can be considered as islands forming a multiple-mouth bay,
and the Archipelago known as the Florida Keys certainly can
form one side of that bay, and it is

lawfully conceptual#

The Florida Bay is historically a part of Florida,
ancient maps and charts that we introduced in evidence
demonstrate a remarkable continuity of Florida Bay, by whatever
name, as a distinctive area with roughly the same boundaries
through the Spanish experience, the British experience, and
the American experience.
And these date back to the Jeffery’s map of 17S3,. and
it shows Richmond Bay and Chatham Bay as the designation of
the area that is now called Florida Bay.

In the early maps,, as I pointed out, the Keys area
were a solid line mass, and it showed mud rlats iiora ■.

Also, the United States acquired title to Florida
from Spain by virtue of the Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and
Limits.
Article II of that Treaty provided for the King of
Spain to cade to the United States — and I hope you will pay
close attention to this language “-"in full property and
sovereignty, all of the territories which belong to him
situated on the eastward of the Mississippi, known by the
name of East and West Florida.

The adjacent islands

dependent on said provinces which relate directly to the
property and sovereignty of said provinces", unquote.
It is clear to us,from this language, that the
Treaty would include the Dry Tortugas and the water area
between the islands and the mainland, known as Florida Bay,
What is the utilisation of Florida Bay?

Bo as to

establish a historic bay.

To begin with, when they belonged — when the
Territory belonged to them, the Spanish and the British

1800's.

All of this is in the record, and I won't mention

transcript pages, but 1 will relate specifics in the record.
The sponge industry began in 1849,

It extended

from the very shallow waters, sponging to Hawk Channel between
the Keys and the reefs»
One of our witnesses, Senator Hodges# who is the
Director of the Department of Natural Resources, said:

In ray

mind, I would consider it once again, the 45-degree angle from
the Tortugas north to Cape Romano, as an area, that was
utilised for fisheries and for sponging and for all other
economic activities.
At about 1870, sponging expanded to the areas up to
50-foot in dentil by the use of the glass-bottom bucket,
Kirk Monroe published an article,

Sponge and Sponges

in the Florida Reefs, in Scribner’s Magazine in 1892, and he
noted that the Key Nest sponger has a choice of two distinct
fishing grounds:

the Ray and the reef.

"This former, the Bay, includes all of the waters
of the Gulf of Mexico, washing the western coast of Florida” ,

States Tariff Commission notes the diving area from Cape

Florida Straits in 1850, but had gone on since the early 1700’s,
What are the expressions of sovereign authority in
'lorida Bay?

In 1822, Florida complained to the federal

70

government about british interlopers in the area from Cape
Florida to the Dry Tortugas, fishing and turtling.
By 1825, federal revenue cutters were patrolling
the southwest coast of Florida»

in 1826, the United States

ordered all foreign fishermen from South Florida waters.
In 1832, Government Duval indicated that Florida
fishing and turtling were exclusively and solely for the local
jurisdiction and for Florida citizens, and he opposed giving
British fishermen the right to use Florida waters or Florida
Bay»
And, by the way, these ships that were in contention
were from twenty to fifty-*ton ships, and would have to bo
employed in the deepwater of Florida Bay, which would be at
the outer perimeters [indicating on map]»
And -this request by Great Britain was not granted.
The Florida Legislature, in 1832 enacted the law
for protection of the fisheries of the Coast of Florida, which
included all of the seas, bays, creeks, and harbors adjacent
to, of the islands or Keys of the Territory.
And the testimony is that it obviously included
Florida Bay.
In the early 1860'a, Florida seized Connecticut
ships fishing off the Keys.

Historically, Florida Bay was

considered *»- and this was before Florida's readmission to
the "■ Vi QjA ■*.*=* historically Florida Bay was considered a

71
strategic military area.

Key West was a United States

Military Post in the 1820‘s.
In 1822, deepdraft vessels ware used by the United
States to combat pirates in waters north and south of the
Florida Keys, and the Army set up a post in the Keys in 1831.
In 1850, General Harney had patrols from Fort Myers across
the waters of Florida Bay, and Barnes Sound to the Florida
Keys.
Federal ships in early 1860 continuously patrolled
the waters along the Florida Keys, and the Gull Loasc, during
the Civil War, to stop blockade runners.
And we can go on. And of course I mentioned to you
that the Florida leased lands for oil drilling in Florida Bay,
beginning in 1.94.1 **“ and this included all of

s

lorida Bay up co

the 45-degree line from the Tortugas to Cape Romano,
The Territorial Water Acts of the State in 1963
require aliens or foreign nationals to have a license <-o fibh
in Florida waters.
What are the indications of foreign acquiescence,
which is the third criteria of the Florida Bay area?
In 1831, the British request to fish in South
Florida waters certainly indicates acquiescence in control
by the State or the federal government.
In 1845, Great Britain again asked for permission to
fish in Florida waters, and an Act of the Legislature to

72
protest the fisheries of the Coast of Florida was passed.
Foreign nationals have never challenged marine
patrol enforcement? it has been pointed out in the testimony
that a. lack of State enforcement over the Tortugas Strait
beds would just about wipe out a $16 million a year industry,
and the Government of Cuba,..as pointed out,

by Senator Fulbright,

during the negotiations between Cuba and the United States
forthe Treaty in 1957 to keep Cuban nationals from fishing
in the shrimp beds of the Dry Tortugas, Senator Fulbright said
that the Cuban Government was honoring the request of
Florida, they had a gentlemen’s agreement which certainly
indicates acquiescence in the authority of the State of
Florida.
Professor Tebeau, who is a Professor Emeritus of
History at the University of Miami, testified that northward
from Key West on the Gulf side, the main lines of sea traffic
lay west of „ Cape Romano.
This was a passage inside the Cape, but its usage
was limited to small boats with skilled navigators to clear
the Tortugas Channels through the shallow waters, between
these limits lay the distinctive

.area now designated Florida

Bay, set aside by geography and history as part of Florida.
And Dr. Samuel Proctor, a history professor at the
University of Florida, transcript page 400, said that
Floridians and other informed persons at the time knew the

73
importance of the resources adjacent to the Florida coast.
They were aware of the importance of these waters.
Consequently, these men writing Florida's Ccnstitu~
tion and operating in 'die best interests of the State, would
have wanted to enclose as much of the area as possible wiuiin
their State boundaries.

This they sought to do in writing the

Boundary Article in the 1862 — 1863 Constitution.
We have historically exercised police power over the
statute, the 1893 statute, prohibiting foreign fishing in
Florida waters without a license, die 1915 State law making
all fishing in Florida waters, including the Bay, to be
Florida property? and die regulation of shrimping in the
Tortugas since 1957.
No on® has challenged Florida’s exercise of its
marine conservation laws, except two Cuban vessels, which were
arrested within three leagues of land? in addition to which tiie
federal government, in a pending case .in the United Spates
District Court, the Northern District of Florida, has sought an
injunction against the State and has asserted that Florida
attempts to regulate or prohibit foreign fishing boats more
than twelve geographic miles from any part of die coast line
of die State, between Cape Romano and die Dry Tortugas.
So even the federal government recognized that we
do attempt to exercise police x>wer all the way out to the 45degree angle between die Tortutas and Cape Romano.

74
Perhaps the most significant aspect of this case
in determining the attitude of foreign governments to Florida's
claim of historic title to Florida Bay is the absolute absence
of any evidence or hint of evidence from the federal govern­
ment that any country has in the past 150 years protested or
objected to Florida's overt active assertion of sovereign
claim to Florida Bay.
And highly significant in regard to assertion of
sovereignty is the act of the United States Congress in
affirming toihe world in 1868 that one of the States in 'the
Union

,

Florida, had a marine boundary from the Dry Tortugas

Islands to 'the mainland, which farmed

the northwest

perimeter of the Bay.
Throughout these proceedings, the United States'
concern for its position with regard to foreign affairs has
been paramount*
With all due respect to the government, foreign
affairs is not a material issue.

Wiether war powers, authority

over interstate;, or foreign commerce, or authority over inter­
national relations may be exercised within Florida's boundaries,
whether marine land or dry land, has never been at issue.
These paramount powers, we concede, may be exercised if
appropriate by the federal government in any part of any State
at any time.
But just because they may be paramount in Lake

Okeechobee, which happens to be an inland lake in the State
of Florida, does not mean that Florida cannot regulate
fishing therein or the taking of the minerals from the bottom,
from the seabed.
Also, -there is nothing in the record to indicate
that innocent passage of foreign shipping is in fact frustrated
by Florida's claim that the Keys, out to and including the
Tortugas, constitute an integral part of the State, nor is
there any evidence that innocent passage in the area between
the Kays and the mainland, denominated Florida Bay, has or
will in any way be denied, should tills Court find that it is
a historic bay constituting the inland waters of the State of
Florida,
There will be no interruption to the right of
innocent passage.
And this case was not brought in the face of any
international dispute involving Florida.
Our last major point, and I think I have just a
few, about six or seven minutes left

five minutes left.

My last major point, and we preserve all our other arguments
in the brief not argued, is that this case, as it relates to
Florida, does require a determination of the rights under the
Submerged Lands Act and United States_j/s. Florida, that it
mandates a determination of the demarcation between the Gulf
of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.

76

Because if the federal government, assuming arguendo,
is correct, and xio are limited to three marine miles in the
Atlantic and three leagues in the Gulf, and not any further,
■then it’s imperative that we determine where is the Gulf and
where is the Atlantic.
We contend that the boundary between these two
bodies is at Latitude 25 degrees, 40 minutes north, the posi­
tion of Cape Florida? which means that the Florida Keys and
the Straits of Florida, southwestwardly of such latitude, are
located in the Gulf of Mexico and not in the Atlantic Ocean,
The Master says everything north of the Tortugas
is Gulf, and everything south is in the Atlantic,

And that

dispute here is about a thousand square miles, the
difference between three leagues and three miles*
The federal government takes its description — and
by the way this is their major piece of evidence, I think
their sole piece of evidence on this point.

They take a

description from the Gulf which the Master adopts from the
International Hydrographic Bureau, Special Publication.
They say this proves up their case.

And in the description

itself, on the face of the map, it says''these limits have
no political significance whatsoever," unquote, and

then

the authors go on to say that it's not to be regarded as
representing the results of a full geographic study.
They point out it’s primarily for uniformity.

We presented the testimony of a renowned expert in
marine geology and sedimentoiogy, he testified unequivocally
that the International Hydrographic Bureau’s boundaries
between the Gulf and the Atlantic have no scientific basis
whatsoever in terras of these parameters that form the basis
for the geological and geometric boundaries.
Florida contends that the finding of the Master is
incorrect, contrary to the weight of the evidence, as to
where the Gulf meets the Atlantic*
We contend that it should be decided on marine
geology and sedimentology, and it is best visualized by the
fact that if the area were to be viewed, if all the water
'were removed, a natural drainage basis would appear separating
the Gulf and the Atlantic at that point.
Historic evidence, mariners' evidence, geological
evidence defining the Straits of Florida and the Florida Keys
as being in the Gulf of Mexico was totally ignored by the
Master.
All of this was subordinate to one piece of evidence
a map, which, as I pointed out, on its face, relies, its
persuasive effect, on the v-ary point for which it was used»
The. testimony of the State is quite persuasive.
Dr. Gihsburg testified, he referred to the Jurist Text,
beginning with the 1957 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica
including the 171 edition of McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of

70
Science and Technology, the Bulletin of Geological Society of
American, 1971, the 1972 edition of the same Bulletin,* he
also — in each of these it refers to the Florida Shelf or
the Florida Platform, including the Keys and the Tortugas
entirely within the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, he testified how topography identifies
the dividing line, the submarine topography visualized as
a terrestrial landscape, would separate the Gulf and the
Atlantic Basin.

He testifies, at 25 degrees, 40 minutes noth?

with the Keys and the Tortugas and the Florida shrimps in the
Gulf.
He testified how sediment incidences the dividing
line.

He said there is a. relatively abrupt change between

the coral reef limestone south of Soldier Key to Atlantic
type sandy barrier islands north of Cape Florida and that
that is the major change in the coastal morphology.
He also testified as to the organisms that indicates
the dividing line,
Go our position, therefore, is that the configuration
of the sea floor should control,

The Straits of Florida are

part of the Gulf, since they would drain into the Gulf
if they were dried up one basis.
The basis for this position is that submarine
topography should follow the same criteria as terrestrial
topography. Dry land is considered to be part of the Basin

79
into which it drains, since the Straits of Florida would
drain into the Gulf, if on dry land they are a part of the
Gulf of Mexico Basin, they are not part of the Atlantic
Ocean»
So the weight and the quality of the evidence
clearly indicates that Florida's contention as to the location
of the Gulf of Mexico is correct.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I believe your time

is up, Mr. Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Attorney General.
Thank you, Mr» Jones.
The case is submitted.
