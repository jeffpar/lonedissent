PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-1908.
Mr. Rome, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
MR. ROME:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a
three-judge panel of which, in a divided opinion, reversed
the grant of summary judgment which had been entered by
Judge Trautman of the United States District Court of the
Eastern District on Pennsylvania on behalf of the
Defendants — the Petitioners here.
Chief Judge Seitz, writing for* himself and also
for Judge Hastie, reversed the grant of summary judgment.
Judge Aldisert wrote a dissent.
The factual background of the case is the
following:
Mr. Ash filed a complaint just a

little bit more

than five weeks before the Presidential election of November,
1972, asserting a claim against Bethelehem Steel Corporation
and 12 of its directors and senior executive

officers,

claiming on behalf of himself as voter-citizen and stock*
holder and, deritivatively on behalf of Bethlehem steel

4
Corporation itself, claiming a violation of 18 USC Section
610 on the basis of a charged plan by the Defendants to
violate 610 by utilizing the resources of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation, including the expenditure of corporate
funds to bring about a Republican victory in 1972.
More specifically, it was asserted by the Plaintiff
below that corporate funds were expended for ads which
appeared in magzazine3 of national circulation and also in
newspapers which appeared in 19 towns where the company had
plants, which ads were said to be ''blatantly partisan."
The ad in question, only one, which was attached
to the complaint, appears at page 16 of the record and is
also reproduced at the end of the Petitioners' brief here.
There was also a second count under which pendent
jurisdiction was asserted, based on assertion of ultrabriberies
and illegality under Delaware lav;, going back again to the
same element of expenditure of corporate funds.
Injunctive relief, including the corrective
advertising to be placed at the expense of the individual
defendants, compensatory and punitive damages, as well as
attorneys' fees and costs were sought.
A temporary restraining order was sought which
appears at page 17 of the record in which there was sought
a prohibition against Bethlehem Stteel Corporation from
purchasing or paying for advertising Identical to or

5
substantially similar to Exhibit A.
That was refused and thereafter, there was an
application made for preliminary Injunctive relief and I
wou Id invite and request your Honors’ attention to the
language of the prayer for preliminary injunction which
appears at 826 of the record because there the Plaintiff
sought to prohibit the individual defendants from causing
Bethlehem to purchase or pay for any advertising in
connection with any federal action, Including but not
limited to advertisements identical or substantially similar
to Exhibit A prohibiting Bethlehem from purchasing or paying
for any advertising in connection with any federal election,
including but not limited to advertisements identical to or
substantially similar to Exhibit A, directing Bethlehem Steel
to cancel all advertising previously ordered in connection
with any federal election, including but not limited to
advertisements identical to or substantially similar to
Exhibit A.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rome, the Court of Appeals didn’t,

in its opinion, necessarily approve that form of relief, did
it?
MR. ROME:

I believe, sir, the necessary conse­

quence of the majority opinion is, indeed, not only to
approve the form of relief, but, in actuality, to sanction
injunctive relief as a preferred remedy contrasting with the

6
criminal remedy set out in the statute itself and this,
thereby, in our contention, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, at once
creating an entire problem of prior restraint because my
purpose in reading this language to the Court is to show that
there was, in actuality, a prior restraint not only of the
particular ad but, indeed, of ads that had not yet been
prepared or published.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't the Respondent seek

damages also?
MR. ROME:

Yes, your Honor, damages both

compensatory and punitive were sought and the majority of
the Court of Appeals below held that there was an implied
-ra&e- of action on behalf not only of stockholders but also
on behalf of all voters as a result of which, in our sub­
mission, there is an unparalled implication of a private
right of action, in this case going far beyond anything
which to our knowledge has ever occurred before.
Most particularly, the majority panel below
concluded that it was not bound by this Court's decision
ln

but turned, rather, to Borak and although it held

under Borak that the implication of a private remedy was
appropriate,to use Chief Judge Seitz* words, he went on to
conclude that it was appropriate for a variety of reasons,
including the availability of a more expeditious remedy,
including the possibility of some sort of partisanship on

'7
I

the part of the governmental authorities charged with the
enforcement of the Act and also because It was appropriate
and necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute.
Judge Aldisert dissented based upon this Court’s
ruling in AMTRAK saying, indeed, that the majority had defied
this Court’s ruling in AMTRAK.
The trial judge, who was reversed by the majority
panel, had concluded on the basis of the advertising which
was presented to him that there was not an implied right of
action, that 610 had to be narrowly construed in order to
avoid a constitutional infringement of the first Amendment
and that, as so construed, the expenditures here involved
did not come within active electioneering, which would come
xvithin the prohibition of the Act and he also said that to
enjoin cne expenditures here would raise the gravest
constitutional issues under the First Amendment.
Following the reversal, there was — following
the grant of the denial of the preliminary injunction, there
was an appeal to the Third Circuit which affirmed the denial
of the preliminary injunction.

Thereafter, there was an

application for security for expenses below, as a result of
which the state pendent jurisdiction count was dropped out
by my friend and thereafter the're was a motion for summary
judgment filed before Judge Trautman on the basis of the
fact that there is no implied private right of action under

8
610.

That is, 610 is Inapplicable as a matter of law and

that 610 is unconstitutional.
There was a motion for evidentiary hearing which
was denied because Judge Hartman found that

on

the basis

of the language of the Act, on the basis of the congressional
history and the purpose of the Act, there was no implied
right of action and he could rule that as a matter of law
and summary judgment was then granted without opinion.
I would urge your Honors to examine the material
that was published by Bethlehem admittedly, which is
attached to the brief and in the record.
In our submission, an examination of that material
will show that it is not to be identified with any anti­
social conduct.
This kind of political speech", we submit, ought
not to be characterized as a crime.

It cannot be said to

come from a corrupt or corrupting source.
As a matter of fact, in our urgent submission
to this Court, it comes within the language of Justice Reid
in the CIO case, if the earlier provision, 313, were con­
strued to prohibit the publication by corporations, in the
regular course of conducting their

affairs, of periodicals

advising their member stockholders and customers of danger
or advantage to their interest from the adoption of measures
or the election to offices of men espousing such measures,

9
the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to its
constitutionality.
In our contention here, the advertising and
material that is before the Court represents nonpartisan
sponsorship of issue-oriented advertising.
Contrary to the view taken by Chief Judge Seitz
for the majority below, we say there are an abundance of
countervailing reasons why this Court should not conclude
that the implication of a private right of action is
necessary here.
As your Honors are aware, the Government has filed
an Amicus brief in this case.

It has not contended that

the implication 0f a private right of action is necessary.
It is here simply to support the constitutionality of Section
610.
As a matter of fact, the implication of a private
right of. action in our view ’would come within the ban
suggested by the National Milk

case that such private right

of action is subject to great potential abuse because here
we have, as the result of the opinion by the Third Circuit,
an ability on the part of all of the

voters of the United

States, all of the stockholders of corporations, to bring
action for injunctive relief and damages and what this would
mean by way of an engulfment of the courts throughout the
country is going to be seen because it lends Itself to the

10

possibility of conflicting judgments coining out of different
courts on the same ads, a

multitude of litigation coming

throughout the country, ultimately coming to this Court.
Moreover, it is admitted in this case that there
is nothing in the congressional history of the litigation
which shows any intention on the part of the Congress to
Imply a private right of action.
On the contrary, as your Honors are aware, this
is legislation which has for over 50 years evoked the
continuing repeated concern and attention of the Congress.
It has been, as your Honors are axuare, recently
amended, not only in '71 but also in '74 and in our view,
one of the countervailing reasons that militate against the
implication of a private remedy is the fact that in the
amendment of 1974, although there was an amendment which
created a private right of action under Title III of the
Act, there was no change by the Congress of that which
appears in Title II of the Act and this comes within what
Mr. Justice Stewart wrote in AMTRAK with regard to the
application of exclusial onliness.
In addition, there is nothing in the language of
the Act itself which speaks or hints in terms of the
implication of a private right of action and as a matter of
a

act, this legislation shows a carefully—devised program

elaborated by the Congress which now has set up a federal

election commission as the result of which there are pro­
cedures available for remedies including criminal remedies
as well as specific civil remedies.
Under Mr. Justice Brennan's reference to the
cross light in the Pipefitter’s case we say that this kind
of cross light is capable of being brought to bear upon
Section 610 as the result of which it ought not to be held
to imply a private right of action.
In addition, normal principles of statutory
.construction, we suggest, dictate the denial of the private
right of action because there has, to the best:1)of our research
and knowledge, your Honors, never been a situation in which
there has been the suggested implication, of the private right

y

of action which at once runs counter tol$lrst5$mendment rights
S

■
v

... ,

of the Defendants — the Petitioners here •—- ajrid carried with
it inevitably, inescapably, the possibility, ’the Ine\rit ability
of prior- restraint because, I repeat, Judge Seitz, for the
majority below, literally said that there was a much more
expeditious remedy to be found, particularly in the form of
an injunctive relief by the implication of a private right
of action and how that could occur or come about without
necessarily, at once, leading to a prior restraint as is
evidence by the nature of the language of the motion for
preliminary injunction that was originally sought here, is
something that really belies reality.

12
Now, In addition to that, we have the situation
that the rules laid down by this Court, particularly in
areas that intend to intrude upon First Amendment rights,
call for a narrow construction, a restrictive construction,
in order to avoid or Bave the constitutional issue.
But, on the contra^, that which the Court below
has done has been to produce the most expanded kind of
interpretation of expenditure.
Your HOnors will recall that the rationale back
of the congressional legislation had to do with the thought
of undue influence e?r fating from aggregations of wealth
whether by corporations or by unions and a desire to protect
the minority interests within the corporations or labor
unions.
The reality of it is that the expenditure clause
in 6l0, as interpreted by 591 which the court below did,
runs in the face of that kind of understanding.for the
reason that the interpretation means that the expenditure
of $1, even though it had the consent, unanimous consent of
the stockholders or of members of a labor union would ne-verthe less come within the ban

of the statute.

Moreover, our contention is that the ads on their
face — the ad, the speech, the folder — cannot be construed
as representing active electioneering.
They cannot be held because they do not mention

13
the name of a single candidate, nor* do they mention the
name of a political party.
They cannot be held* therefore, to come within the
language that Mr. Justice Frankfurter used in the UAW case
as something that was intended to influence the public at
large to vote for a particular candidate or a particular
party.
QUESTION:

Does your argument here — are you

making a constitutional argument now or are you making a
statutory construction argument?
•

MR. ROME:

•*

.

It runs both ways, Mr. Justice White

for the reason that in our contention there ought not to be
an

implication of a private right of action when constitu­

tional infringement occurs and, in addition, there is the
constitutional argument in and. of Itself.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if the statute plainly covered

these kinds of expenditures, then you would reach the
constitutional argument.
But now, how about —* Involved here is Section
591, I gather?
MR. ROME:

610 and 591.

QUESTION:

You don’t disagree that 591 standards

are relevant to 610?
MR. ROME:

Oh, no, sir, I do'not disagree.

the contrary, we say that 610 has to be interpreted and

On

defined by reason of 591.
QUESTION:

And so you are saying that these

expenditures aren’t plainly covered by either section?
MR. ROME:

We say that the sections were never

Intended to cover this kind of Issue-oriented nonpartisan
advertising or communication because —
QUESTION:

And if not, I gather, if you are

correct in that, then the constitutional arguments you make
need not be — they disappear.
MR. ROME:

That is right, sir, if there is no —

QUESTION:

Okay, using the constitutional argument

is a reason for giving the construction to what you are
arguing.
MR. ROME:

Yes, sir, which is what has been done

before, a narrow construction of expenditures so as to avoid
running counter to the constitutional principles that are —
QUESTION:

Well, then, you wouldn’t have to

decide whether there was a private right of action, either,
if your narrow construction of the term "expenditures" is
right.

4
MR. ROME:

It would then reach the conclusion,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the complaint does not state a
cause of action on its face because it does not then

’come

within the ban of expenditure as used in 610 and 591.
QUESTION:

The criminal sanction would not be

15
applicable.
NR. ROME:

Would not be applicable because there

would have been no wrongdoing committed by Bethlehem or
the Defendant.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals just plain

disagreed with you that as a matter of fact these particular
expenditures were partisan.
MR. ROME:

It held only, Mr. Justice White, that —

QUESTION:

Is it your position that —

MR. ROME:

— it was a suspended issue of f£(Ct as

a result of which the grant of summary judgment was reversed
and the case was remanded to the District Court

for a trial

with regard to that, although the earlier situation — excuse
me, sir — the earlier situation was one in which the trial
judge himself as a matter of law had concluded that there was
not partisanship in the publications.
QUESTION:

Yes,

yes.

MR. ROME:

One additional point that also emerges

In this factual context is a denial of equal protection of
the laws because 610 is applicable only to corporations and
labor unions and obviously is not applicable to any of the
other numerous groups that are as much capable of being
permitted and have the same rights to express their views so
that the electorate may hear their views because that is where
also the First Amendment right goes as well as on the part

16
of the Defendants — the Petitioners here — to express their
views and your Honors will recall that Mr. Justice Douglas,
in his dissenting opinion in UAW speaks in terms of unions,
associations of manufacturers, retail and wholesale trade
groups, consumer leauges, farmers’ unions, religious groups
and every other association representing a segment of
American life as having a First Amendment right to communi­
cate their ideas and the electorate, In turn, having a right
to hear those ideas.

Mr. Justice

QUESTION:

That was a dissenting opinion.

MR. ROME:

Yes, sir, it was.

It was, indeed.

Rehnquist but it served to point up the fact

that in the face of repeated expressions by this Court
raising red flags, at least as to the constitutionality of
Section 610, the Court below, instead of adopting a restric­
ted interpretation of expenditure and the language of 610
for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election
or the election to federal office, on the contrary, took a
very expanded view sc that there is no expenditure of any
kind that could possibly come without the ban of the Act and
definition hidden by the majority of the Court below.
Our view is that in actuality there is a denial
of the equal protection of the laws because beyond mere
problems of corporate aggregation of wealth, as your Honors,
1 bei“'~v'e* are we 11-aware, there are some 50 entities that

IT
are not corporations which are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and there are all these other entities that are
equally involved in the robust, vigorous discussion that
your Honors have said was necessary in order to protect First
Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rome —

MR. ROME:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

If we were to disagree with your view

of the scope of expenditures but agree that there was no
implied right o.f action, what happens to the constitutional
question?
MR. ROME:

It is not then reached, your Honor.

If there is no implied right of action —
QUESTION:

That ends this lawsuit.

MR. ROME:

Yes, that ends this lav/suit.

QUESTION::

Yes, sir.

And you say the constitutional argu-

ment —- there’s some criminal prosecutions.
MR. ROME:

Except, your Honor, may I bring to your

attention in that regard the fact that the amendment to the
FECA of 197^ has created the Federal Election Commission
which Is intending to get underway.
We have a Presidential election coming up and this
comes within the language of your Honors’ decision in the
Cox Broadcasting case.
There are enormously important First Amendment

18
rights which invite your Honors’ determination now rather
than the fact which has been the case that for 18 years
there has been a miasmic cloud over this entire subject as
the result of which it is difficult for U3 to conclude other
than that there is an extremely chilling effect on the
right of free speech, not only of corporations but of all
other —
QUESTION:

Well, under the new lav;, there is an

administrative agency that has —
MR. ROME:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

■— responsibility for enforcing this

MR. ROME:

This law, your Honor, as amended in

law?

197^ is made up of a —
QUESTION:
desist power?

They have — they just have cease and

Does it have to go to court or what does it

have to do?
MR. ROME:

It has the ability to bring civil

action and there is al30 the continuing criminal remedy
available.
The Commission is made up of six members, the
clerk of the Senate, the Secretary of the Senate, the clerk
of the House and then —
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, do you think that under

the new law there will be an argument about there being a

private cause of action?
MR. ROME:

I would think9 your Honor, that there

is bound to be because this case in itself —
QUESTION:

There ±3 nothing In the new 'statute that

says, whatever this agency may do, that what it may do is
exclusive.
QUESTION:

Well, but the Congress has interposed

an administrative agency which has civil remedies available.
MR. ROME:
Act.

But that comes within Title III of the

Section 610 comes within Title II of the Act, sir, and

this is why we say that the cross .light to be brought to
bear here indicates that Congress quite knowingly never
intended that there be the implied private right of action
because this is not the kind of statute that is just once
treated by the Congress.
QUESTION:

On the contrary —

But if you think you have a strong

argument under the old statute, you certainly would have a
strong argument under the nexv statute.
MR. ROME:

Indeed, your Honor, and this is one

reason why, since the matter is here and certiorari has been
granted, that covers because we did, indeed, raise the
constitutional question and we hope and request chat your
Honors would give consideration to the constitutional issue
because it has ongoing enormous impact and inevitably there
will be other cases that will follow or attempt to follow the

20
precedent of the Third Circuit.
With your Honors' permission, unless there are
other questions, I would reserve —
QUESTION:

What do you think the new law means

jwhen it says, "The commission has primary jurisdiction with
respect to the civil enforcement of such provisions," and
"such provisions" includes 610, doesn't it?
MR. ROME:

Yes, sir, I —

QUESTION:

What does that mean?

MR. ROME:

I think that there was an intent by

Congress to create an administrative commission that would
bring uniformity and a growing body of expertise to this
problem and thereby not intending to create a private right
of action which would lead to a variety of diverse,
inevitably conflicting opinions because every district court
in the country would be engulfed by the possibility that
every voter within that district as well as every shareholder
in any corporation within that district would be able to go
into court and would not be barred by the fact that somebody
else has gone in on that same ad or material that is sub­
stantially identical to it.
QUESTION:

I take it you have petitioned for —

you raise questions here besides the constitutional issue.
MR. ROME:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

But you don't want us to decide those?

21

MR. ROME:

Oh, X would hope that your Honor would

give consideration to all the issues that we have —
QUESTION:

YOu don’t care on what ground you win,

as long as you win.
MR. ROME:

I hope desperately to win, your Honor.

[Laughter.]
If there are no other questions, then, I would
reserve my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may reserve the

balance.
Mr. Berger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BERGER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, may I first answer Mr. Justice Stewart’s question
to respond to Petitioner’s counsel.
It is true, sir, that the new Act uses the phrase,
"primary Jurisdiction” and that is going to be a keystone of
my argument.
To the extent to which the new Act sheds any light,
cross or crosseyed on this problem, it is in favor of the
position which I advocate here today because, as the Joint
Committee Conference Report says, and I have quoted it on
page 35 of my brief, this was for the purpose of assuring
that private citizens would exhaust their administrative

22
remedies and as Congressman Braddom has put it, first —
which means, of course, as a precondition to bring a private
right of action or cause of action.
Now, may it please the Court, I disagree with
my friend's characterization of what the lower court did
here.
The Petitioner's argument proceeded, it seemed to
me, a3 though the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had
granted summary Judgment in favor of the plaintiff below,
the Respondent here.
It did no such thing.

And

may I say on the

constitutional point as a footnote that the district judge
never even mentioned the constitutionality, much less passed
on it or addressed the question.
The Court of Appeals did not address the
constitutional question.

So that there is before this

honorable Court now a decision which merely remands the
case to the trial court for trial.
i

Not only is there an insufficient record with
respect to the constitutional question, there is no record.
May I further point out to your Honors that the
posture of the case is extremely significant in addition to
what I have just said.
My friend has correctly told you that the compplaint averred a plan on the part of the Defendants,

Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Its directors, to use the
vast resources of that corporation for the specific partisan
political purpose of influencing the 1972 election for one
of the candidates.
That is what the complaint alleged and it said,
using the good old lawyerese English, "Interalia the actions
taken pursuant of the plan included the ad which the
Petitioner said referred to him."
That ad was widely published throughout the United
States.

Pamphlets of Mr. Cort’s speech ■— pamphlets were

distributed and reprints of the speech were very widely
/•

(*'

'-(V-.’

distributed.
It happens therefore that because of”the motion
for preliminary injunction, we have not only the avowance of
,

v

*

”'lK

' '*

■

i‘

the complaint but we also have admissions, by the Defendants
of certain facts included within which are thebe publications
•i.

v

-■

which I have described.
I would put before your Honors the issue as
follows
The first question Is whether or not the complaint
.

J

:■ 4, , }

..

•

r

.* - .

states a valid cause of action for the violation of Section
olO of the Act.
Secondly, whether the facts averred in the complaint
and already admitted make out a prima fascie case of a
violation of Section 610 and,

Thirdly, if your Honors agree with me on those
first two questions, whether the Act, Section 610, is
unconstitutionally facially or as applied by the Third
Circuit.
Your Honor Mr. Justice Rehnquist was entirely
correct in observing that the court below did not grant any
relief nor did it intimate that whatever kind of relief
that was requested by the Plaintiff in the District Court,
whether by way of Injunction or otherwise, was proper and
correct and should be granted.
All it said was, let the matter go back to Judge
Trautman for a full trial.
QUESTION:

Mr. Berger —

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
of

Bethlehem Steel.

Yes, sir.
You mentioned and emphasized the size
Does not the Act apply to any corpor­

ation of any size?
MR. BERGER:

Yes, sir, I emphasized this, may it

please your Honor Justice Powell, because I am about to
turn to the underlying policy of the statute and that is to
prevent the application of vast resources improperly to
the
Influence/federal electoral process.
That Is why I
emphasized that.
QUESTION:

But would the statute apply to the

3mall one-man corporation with assets of $1,000?

25
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
It would apply to a nonprofit cor­

poration?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

I do not believe so.
Why?

Is there any exemption?

I don’t find, any exemption but I find

that this Court has put a gloss upon the interpretation —
and Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said in the UAW case it has
got to be active electioneering.
I am unaware of any nonprofit corporation which
correctly could actively electioneer.
QUESTION:

Are you

familiar with the League of

Women's Voters?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

To a certain extent I am, sir.
It may or may not be a corporation but

it could be and there are very large foundations in the
United States that might very well urge the public to get
out to vote.

Would you consider that to come within this

statute?
MR. BERGER:

I wnuld say that if the League of

Women Voters — assuming it were a corporation and it sent
these messages out to its own stockholders, if that is what
your Honor is telling me, that that is explicitly excepted
by the Act, sir.
QUESTION:

Suppose they ran ads in the same

26

publication?
MR. BERGER:
that would violate It,
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

It could be arguably urged that
That is not this case.
Right.
We do not have that case here, your

Honor, and I am not asking your Honors to make a decision
on anything except the affirmance In this case.
It may very well be that If that kind of case
came up, there would be a reason for concluding that the
Act — it was not within the Act's coverage but that Is
not this case.
QUESTION:

To what extent Is the content of

the exhibits rele\'ant to the case in its present posture,
in your view?
MR. BERGER:

Only, Mr. Chief Justice, to the

extent that they constitute admissions already of record
but In my view of the case, It i3 the averments

of the

complaint that counts and these averments add substance —
these admissions add substance to the averments in the
complaint.
I must say I quite agree with the opinion of
the Court below that, taken in the context in which these
ads, this

speech, the reprint of the speech and the

pamphlets appear that under all the circumstances, a jury
and this was a request for a jury trial — a Jury could

27

reasonably conclude that this

constituted acts of election­

eering for one of the candidates.
Now, the argument made by the Defendants In the
Court below proceeded on the theory that simply because the
name of a candidate was not mentioned, there could be no
violation of the Act.
Nothing could be further from correct because, as
Chief JUdge Selta pointed out in the Third Circuit, you
have to look at all the circumstances and if a reader of
this material of average intelligence would perceive or
could perceive that it was indeed a partisan proclamation

on behalf of one of the two candidates, then simply because

QUESTION:

‘

Would it be relevant at all — and

perhaps this — in your point of view we haven’t reached
this stage yet — but would it be relevant at all to
inquire whether this content would be appropriate in a
lecture by a political science professor??
MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, anybody can say what

was in these materials.

Mr. Cort could say it.

corporation can say it.

The shareholders can say it.

directors can say it.

The
The

The officers can say it.

All that this Act, whose constitutionality you

28
are asked to destroy today, does is to say that if they
wanted to exercise that freedom of speech, let them use their
own money and not the money of the shareholders.
That Is all this Act does.
Now, may 1 proceed with ~
QUESTION:

But the same might be said with

reference to the lectura that I was suggesting hypothetically,
that if the professor wants to make a particular speech, he
can make it anyway he wants, but he can't make it as pro­
fessor in the lecture hall at the statesupported university.
Is that ■’—
MR. BERGER:

That may be.

But if he were

required to use a different room or, let's say, if he had to
make his speech on his own time Instead of on the school's
time, I don't think that would call into play the First
Amendment.
QUESTION:

I take it

your point is now that the

content of this is really irrelevant in spite of what you
said about his giving some support to your position?
MR, BERGER:
irrelevant.

Well, I wouldn't call It entirely

X say two things about it.

I say that first the

case must "be considered on the basis of the averments and the
complaint and they aver very clearly and plainly and give
notice to the Defendants under the federal rules that what is
charged is precisely what this Court has said in Pipefitters„

29
for example.
Now, Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Powell,,
I believe, agreed to that extent it would constitute a
violation of Section 610.
Now, what was admitted for the purpose of a pre­
liminary injunction motion is relevant in showing that the
complaint was not Just something that was frivolous or
thought up in somebody’s head.

In other words, there was

serious basis for the averments.
I may say another thing, in the posture of the
procedure.

In my Judgment, what brought about the confusion

here Is that lower court is under the impression >— I am
talking now about the District Court — that simply because
the district Judge denied the motion for preliminary
injunction which is basod

essentially on the stipulation

of facts which they admitted to, that that foreclosed the
Plaintiff from proving the whole case.
As a matter of fact, pending before the Court of
Appeals and still pending is the issue of the right of
the Plaintiff for full discovery in an evidentiary hearing.
The district judge In a one-paragraph order on
page A87 denied the right to trial, denied the right to
discovery, denied the right to evidentiary hearing and
simply sumarlly dismissed the case.
Now, all the Third Circuit did was send it back

30

for trial.
Nov?, vrith your Honors’ permission, I would like
to address private cause of action point because 1 agree
with Mr. Justice Brennan that might be an easy way out but
this Court has never been known to take the easy way out.
QUESTION:

Weil, it is rarely known to decide

constitutional questions.
MR. BERGER:
decide it.

I was not asking your Honors to

I don't think it has to be decided today.
QUESTION:

What?

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

The constitutional issue?

It need not bo decided on this issue.
Assume we disagreed with the other

side on implied action?
MR. BERGER:

I think you should disagi^ee with

them, your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

Yes, I know.
And in that event I think you should

agree v;ith me that the averments of the complaint and the
record as it is shov? enough to

go to the factfinder to

determine whether there has been a violation of Section 610
and that that kind of interpretation of the Act Is not
unconstitutional because It amounts to saying that the Act
is unconstitutional on It's face.
QUESTION:

Oh, yiss, but I gather the Third Circuit

held that if you prove what you claim you can prove, that the

31
610 may prevent it.
MR. BERGERs
QUESTION!

I think that is correct.
And then they said that is consti­

tutional for us to decide.
MR. BERGER:

Ho, they didn't pass on it.

Third Circuit didn't reach that point.

The

They said, we are

sending the whole thing back to Judge Trautroan.
QUESTION:

Yes, but they said it is not

unconstitutional on its face.
MR. BERGER:

They didn't reach the constitutional

point, your Honor, with due deference, sir.
QUESTION:

How about the question of this

overbreadth?
MR. BERGER:

They didn't get into that.

They

got into the — the real gist of it was, the private cause
of action, may it please the Court — and they said that
the complaint avers a valid cause of action in the 610.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Berger, suppose you are right

about all that?
’

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Some time the constitutional question

has got to be decided, even though they didn't — if we
were to agree vfith you that they were right as far as they
went — at least when we sent it back, v;e'd say, now, you
address the constitutional question before you go to trial.

32

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

I think
Because this is the facial claim?
Well, then, I am prepared to argue

that it is constitutional.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

I would, think you would.
And I would like very briefly, with

your Honor’s permission, first to cover the private cause of
action.
I heard the government lawyer this morning give
his analysis of the cases.

I am relying on the same cases

and they began with Texas and Rigsby and Mr. Justice Stewart
wanted tfo know when that was decided.

It was 1916, your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
1

MR. BERGER:

1916?
Yes, sir.

241 U.S.

That was the Safety Appliance Act?
Yes, sir.

And in my analysis of

these eases going right on through Case and Borak, Wyandot,
Bivens, Time and AMTRAK is this:
It goes back to what Mr. Justice Pitney said in
the Rigsby case, that where there is a federal statute and
where there has been a violation of that federal statute
which Imposes standards of conduct, this Court will fashion
a remedy to right that wrong and there is nothing more,
nothing startling about that.

That is the old common law

33
and, indeed, Judge Kirkpatrick in the Cardin case in the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in 1946, decided the
landmark decision of whether or not a private person could
bring a private cause of action for violation of Section
10(b).
Now, that is heavily engrained in our law but he
addressed that question and went right back to Rigsby and
cited the restatement of torts.

That is all that is

involved.
QUESTION:

Aren’t federal courts’ jurisdiction —

isn't to really create coramonlaw the way the state courts do.
MR. BERGER:

No, I am inclined to agree,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

But this is based on a violation of

a federal statute, sir.
QUESTION:
the commonlaw.”

Yes, but you referred to it "Just like

It Isn’t commonlaw.

MR. BERGER:

No, the principle of the commonlaw.

Where there is a violation which causes a wrong, the court
will fashion a remedy.

That is all I meant.

Now, as I analyse these cases we come down to
this, that the allowance that the court will allow the
person harmed by conduct which violates a federal statute
which imposes standards of conduct, if the allowance of the
private cause of action will effectuate the underlying
purpose of the statute and there is nothing in the statute

or the legislative history tc preclude that — that is my
analysis.

Mow —
QUESTION:

Even if that means that you have got

between 400 and 500 district judges who might be dealing
separately and Independently with the question.
MR. BERGER:

I believe, sir, that the federal

judicial system is capable of bringing uniformity into that
kind of situation.

I think that is one of the basic reasons

why the private right of action should be recognised.
QUESTION:

Well, ultimately, we bring the

uniformity here, don’t we?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But that is quite & lot of expended

effort before that happens.
MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, Chief Justice, a lot less

effort than if you let it just go to 50 states.
Now, in CIO in 335 U.S. 1948, this Court told us
what the’ policy of the Congress was and v;hat the purposes
of the Act 610 and its predecessors are.
And they are twofold and or equal importance.
The first, is to protect the federal electoral process and
the second, equally important, is protect the Shareholder or,
later, a union member, against the use of the company’s funds
which he contributed to or the union dues for partisan
political purposes without the consent of the shareholder or

35
the

union member.

which are involved.

Those are the two Congressional purposes
I —

QUESTION:

I suppose it wouldn't be hard to

either discern from the legislative history or to infer
from one’s reasoning processes that the purpose of almost
any federal criminal statute, of which there are hundreds,
if not thousands — and it seems to me that test that you
told us you submitted to

us, this appropriate test would

result in a private cause of action based on almost every
criminal statute in 18 United States Code.
MR. BERGER:
I disagree.

Your Honor, with all due deference,

First —
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

I hope you do, but tell me why.
First, we are deciding this case

and I am going on the basis of the cases that came before
this Court.
It Is not every criminal statute.

It is

the

particular criminal statutes that come here and I have
already analyzed them.
QUESTION:

Yes, but let’s apply your test, this

very broad test of yours.

You can’t find anything in the

legislative history to the contrary that would militate
against a civil proceeding, a civil cause of action.
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

There isn’t —
Well, then, why isn’t there a civil

36
cause of action — well, then why isn’t there one?
MR. BERGER:

Because in mo3t instances,, the

criminal penalty is adequate.
QUESTION:

Well, who is to Judge that?

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

In this, it is not.

This Court.
You mean, if it is a one^year peni­

tentiary offense it is not adequate, but if it is 10 years,
it is and then there is no civil cause of action?
MR. BERGER:
is that is violated.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, what the' specific right
I can’t take it —
It is for Congress to s<j.y what the

criminal penalties are.
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
it is adequate.

The Congress has done so.
And having done so, by definition,

That is what Congress has said.

i'

‘

MR. BERGER:

v

Only to that extent.

But if the

underlying purpose of Congress can — will be served — only
if you allow a private cause of action, that is when you
allow it and that is what I am arguing for and I would like
to explain why in this case you have to allow it.
The criminal penalties here are $10,000 fine. That
is not going to help the shareholder.

That is a fine levied

against his own corporation.
I submit that the way you are going to satisfy the
second purpose — which, by the way, goes back to 1906 v*hen

37
President Theodore Roosevelt sent his message to Congress
asking for the first of these statutes and this has been
uniformly recognized by the three coequal branches of our
government, the Executive, the Legislative and this Court
itself and I say that the only way you can effectuate this
very important purpose — we are not here dealing with just
an ordinary run-of-the-mill criminal statute, the very
foundation of our democracy, our government as it exists,
depends on the purity of the federal electoral process.
The very foundation of our system of enterprise
and business depends upon the recognition of what this
Court has said is the moral right that officials of a
corporation should not misuse the money of the corporation
for purely partisan political purposes.
That is the reason why I submit that in this
case it was correct to have a private right of action, not
only correct but absolutely necessary.
QUESTION:

Now, may I —

Let’s assume for a moment right on

that, that a corporate officer is found guilty of violating
the statute on 11 counts and the district judge imposes
$110,000 maximum penalty available.

Do you suggest that a

stockholder would not have a remedy to bring suit against
him to make him reimburse the corporation for the fine
imposed for his misconduct?
MR. BERGER:

That is what we are doing in our

3«
case.

We are saying right now,
QUESTION:

Not quito.

your Honor —
Not quite.

You want to

shortourcuit that process.
MR. BERGER:

No, no, with due deference, Chief

Justice, we are saying, let the criminal process proceed.
Well, while that proceeds, let the stockholder
make the people who violated the law make restitution to
the corporation.
QUESTION:

At

whose Instance are you suggesting

the criminal process proceed?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

I talked to the

Attorney-GEneral.

Well, but you want it to go back to

the district Judge.
V; -

MR. BERGER:

(•;«;
•*

No, that Is for the criminal process.

All I want —
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

Well, for the present process.
Well, that's — the district Judge

is the forum in which this will be Judged.
QUESTION:

I am addressing my question to you on

the basis of saying your statement that there is no remedy
for the stockholder.

There is quite a good remedy ultimate3.y,

isn’t there?
MR. BERGER:

Only if your Honors will agree with

the Third Circuit that this is an appropriate case to say
that the private cause of action exists.

It is Just like

3S
in Case and Borak.

The PEC is the expert commission.

There

were treble penalties„ your Honor, provided in the Securities
and Exchange laws but in Case and Borak and Deckert in the
?
Affiliated Ute case and the Superintendent of Banking, this
Court has constantly recognized that private stockholders
have the right to bring actions for damages and, indeed, if
I could refer you to the brief that was argued this morning
by the PEC itself, they recognize the validity of the
principle I am arguing for and they said that where you have
a kind of statute such as this which prescribes standards
of conduct, it is appropriate to recognize a private cause
of action because that will stimulate the enforcement and
this Court has repeatedly held that the private actions
by private stockholders is one of the most effective means
of getting enforcement of that law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Berger

—

QUESTION:

What about the statute that makes it

a crime to rob a federally-insured bank?

Do you think the

bank has a civil action in the district court under

federal

question jurisdiction to recover the money that was taken?
MR. BERGER:
might

I would have to review that.

It

very well, but I would have to review the entire

history of the Act and see what the underlying purpose was.
Now —• '
QUESTION:

Mr. Berger —

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yea. sir.
The Third Circuit found this right

to be implied to registered voters as well as to stockholders.
MR. BERGER:

X don't think we have to go that

far, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:
of the statute.

Well, I would like to know your view

There are 75 to 90 million registered voters

so the Third Circuit's opinion says that that many people
could bring this suit.
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Justice POwell, I say, and my

position is that we only have to sustain Mr. Ash's right
because he is a stockholder and stockholders have not
drowned out the federal courts yet.
Secondly ~
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

You'd say —
Excuse me, sir.

I'm sorry.

You are defending here only the stock­

holders' rights.
MR. BERGER:

At this point I'd say, your Honors,

you only have to uphold that.

You don't have to confront

the issue of registered voters.
If you ask me personally, my candor would compel
me to say that I think they do have the vote but you

have

got nothing to worry about because they do have a right
cause of action.

You have nothing to worry about.

41
Your Honors, you ara all aware of the

tremendous

cost of federal litigation and If you think that suddenly
200 million voters are going to rush to

the federal courts

and bring suits, believe me, that is not going to happen in
the real world.
QUESTION:

Could you have recovered — had any

recovery from these people in the state courts?
MR. BEROER:

I think that there is that possi­

bility but I don’t think that —
QUESTION:

Well, can you go into your state

courts and say, these people have violated the federal
statute in giving away this money and that we want to recover
it from

them?
MR. BERGER:

I think that is an arguable position,

Mr. Justice Whit^, but I believe, sir, that that will not
be adequate.
QUESTION:

That Isn't my question to you.

My

question to you, you are an experienced Pennsylvania lawyer I Just wondered if you —
MR. BERGER:

I would have to say that under

Delaware law, sir, that the doctrine of ultra vires would
permit such a state suit but I do think that —
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

That Is on ultra vires.
Yes, sir.
Does that depend at all on the

42
application of federal statutes?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

It does.
It does, yes.
Yes, sir.
And so there is a remedy in the state

courts under 3tate law to vindicate this right.
MR. BERGER:

That's possible, but it is inadequate,

in my submission.
QUESTION":

Oh, it’s not only possible, but you

Just said that it Is there.
MR. BERGER:

Well, I said that I believe that

the state lat* could remedy it to a certain degree but I
also suggest that you are not going to get uniformity.
This involves a question of federal law and the
expertise of the federal Judiciary should be employed, in
addition to which you have a very serious problem that in
mo3t states, Judges are elected and they are subject to
the political process.
One word if I may on AMTRAK.

I believe AMTRAK

and Time fall on the other side of the line of private
auseo of action,

I agree with your Honors’ decision in

AMTRAK.
In AMTRAK9 It did not have a!statute which
provided for recognized status of conduct.

You had a

completely new scheme, a concept for running a national

43
rail passenger railroad.
Now, in that context, not only would it not
effectuate the purposes of the statute to give passengers
the right to get discontinuances, it would have defeated
the purposes of the Act because If every passenger could
run in and get an injunction against the

discontinuance,

you would not be able to achieve that kind of rational
rail passenger service including rational discontinuances.
That is the reason why AMTRAK falls outside of
the line of cases without differeing from them, without
overruling them and why it is consistent.

It is just totally

distinguishable.
Finally, I suggest that the case, on Its face,
the statute on its face, is constitutional.

There is no

restriction, contrary to what Mr. Rome said, on any free
speech, whether it be the corporation — and in our brief
we have pointed out how very carefully this statute was
drawn.
This Act in 1971 which you are dealing with
follows your Honor’s opinion in Pipefitters. Mr. Justice
Brennan.

It codifies it, precisely what the Court has

said are the traditional and constitutional limits.
The Federal Government has very broad power to
regulate federal elections, particularly the President and
members of Congress.
V' . ••

In doing so9 the only question is, were reasonable
means employed?
I submit that \fhen you have a narrow ly - drawn
statute which allows the corporation to say anything It
wants to to its own stockholders and their families,
including partisan political things, which allows the
corporation to use its money to solicit funds and to
administer separate segregated funds and which allows non­
partisan get-out-the-vdite and all that sort of thing but
says that if

you want to engage in active electioneering,

you have to use your own money or get the segregated funds
from voluntary contributions or shareholders, that doesn’t
present this horrendous picture which the Petitioner is
shouting about.'
QUESTION:

And that is your answer to the

constitutional argument Mr. Rome gave.
MR. BERGER:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir and I 3ay on

the Fifth Amendment that everything that was done here has
a rational basis to apply to the great aggregation of
wealth of the corporation and the union and that there is
no necessity to include all these other elements like
the League of Women Voters that are in the coverage of
"the Act/'
I don't think there is any violation of
Fifth Amendment at all.

i*5

We submit that the Court of Appeals should be
affirmed, the matter go back to the District Court for full
trial.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr, Berger.
Mr. Rome.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN P. ROME, ESQ.
MR. ROME:

With your Honor's permission, I would

bring to your attention the fact that Judge Aldlsert had
earlier commented in the same way that Mr. Justice Stewart
has suggested, to imply a private right of action here he
says, is to suggest that for every written volume of Title
i8 of the United States' Code, there is an unwritten volume
of Title 28.
In actuality, contrary to what Mr. Burger has
said, the congressional history of this legislation shows
that the chairman of the House

Conferees, Mr. Hayes — and

this appears on page 32 and 33 of our brief ~ pointed out
that there was an intention to assure that civil suits are
not misused in a partisan manner and that the complex and
sensitive rights and duties stated in the Act are administer­
ed expertly and uniformly and therefore the private civil
action was created bia t^e Commission under Title III but
not in Title II.
?

*

In actuality„ also, I urge upon your Honors the
recognition that what has been the heart of this case from
the very beginning ha3 been the speech, the ad and the folder
and that alone.
There has been no doubt or dispute about that,
even to the point that ray friends on the other 3ide sought
to have the Third Circuit rule as a matter of law on
summary judgment that those documents in and of themselves
c onstituted a violation and they weren’t seeking to bring in
any other plan or any other activity on the part of the
Defendant.
/

I would also point out that to the extent that
there is discovery sought here, I think that that is a
blatant intrusion into First Amendment areas because you
would, under those circumstances, be Inquiring of the
Individual defendants here about their political ideas and
their views, their party membership which, in our submission,
is absolutely impermissible under the First Amendment.
And in actuality, it is the fact that the district
judge avoided coming to the constitutional issue only
because he said that there was a mandate to narrowly
restrict the interpretation and the definition of
expenditure so as to avoid that result, to enjoin the
expenditures made by

Bethlehem in connection with the

advertisement, the speech and the folder would prevent a

47
corporation from seeking an honest campaign and election
whioh is adverse to its interests thereby giving rise to
grave First Amendment issues.
That is what happened in the district court and
also, the Court of Appeals touched upon constitutional
issues and that appears at page 108 of the record.
Thank you very much, sir.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

gentlemen.
The 'case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:46 o’clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
