P R O C E E D
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

H G S
We will hear argument

first in No. 73-1279, The Williams & Wilkins Company against
the United States.
Mr. Batman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN LATMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LATMAN;
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This is an action for copyright infringement

against the United States Government.

It is hare on a ’writ of

certiorari from the United States Court of Claims,

It’s

brought under the provisions of title 28, United States Code,
section 1493(b) which is an eminent domain type of statute
passed by Congress 15 years ago to cover cases of this type.
An exclusive remedy of that statute is an action in
the Court of Claims for reasonable compensation.

Therefore,

there is no injunction possible in this case nor is any
sought.
The issue is whether the Government system of
reproducing petitioner's copyrighted journal articles in their
entirety through library photocopying is compensable under
this jurisdictional statute as copyright infringement, or
excusable under the defense of

fair use.

Petitioner believes that this issue vitally affects
the future of journals such as its medical and scientific

journals involved in this case ranging to journals of
political affairs, poetry, literary journals which have a
small circulation, privately published, and respected.
Petitioner' also believes that this issue should be
resolved in favor of compensation because its property, namely,
its copyright, has been taken and it should be reasonably
compensated.

I say taken because the Government system of

furnishing reproductions here come within .the policy and the
language of the copyright statute which provides exclusive
rights to print, reprint, publish, and copy, and the defense
of

fair use is completely inapplicable, as I will indicate

in a moment.

That's a doctrine and a defense that applies to

an incidental use by one writer of someone else's work in
terms of a portion of the work but never so as to constitute
an effective substitute for the original work.
In this case —
QUESTION:

Has the doctrine of fair use ever been

upheld or specifically adopted by any opinion of this Court?
MR. LATMAN:

I don't believe it has, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist. The doctrine was raised in the so-called Jack Benny
case which did reach this Court and it was a case which held
that a taking of someone else's work even as a parody constituted
infringement.

That was a Ninth Circuit case.

by this Court was 4 to 4 of necessity and .

The affirmance
without opinion.

The issue also was raised in a case involving

5
Admiral Rickover where Mr. Justice Reed, who was then retired,
was sitting in the District of Columbia circuit and he had
some remarks to say about fair use which we do quote in our
brief which we think are pertinent, basically that taking a
whole work has never been held to be fair use, but when it came
to this Court the judgment was vacated for an insufficient
record on other issues.
I think the answer to the question has to be no.
QUESTION:

Was the Ninth Circuit case the Gas Light

case?
MR. LATMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart.
At least the parody or the burlesque

of Gas Light.
MR. LATMAN:

Yes.

Mr. Benny put on what he called

Auto Light as a parody of Gas Light.

He had the same star,

Ingred Bergman, and the District Court in the Ninth Circuit
heId that even though parody changed the serious melodrama
of Gas Light to a comedy, nevertheless the defense of fair use
did not apply, nevertheless it was infringement.
QUESTION:

And that was affirmed by an equally

divided Court?
MR. LATMAN:

Yes, your Honor.

The learning of those case*' is that the essence of
fair use is that the use should not be an effective substitute.
In this case when we are dealing with a photocopy of a 40- or

6

50-page article, wa think it’s unquestionable that that does
substitute for the original„
The trial judge held for the petitioner on the issue
of liability, reserving the amount of reasonable compensation
for later determination.

The Court of Claims in a four-to-three

decision disagreed and dismissed the petition.
The Government agencies involved are two libraries
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

One is

the National Library of Medicine, which is a library's
library.

It sits at the apex of a nationwide network of

10 regional and 400 local medical libraries.
QUESTION: 'Who are the principal constituents of
those libraries, the users?
MR. LATMAN:

They vary, your Honor.

They include

not only other Government libraries and medical schools and
institutions, but. also private companies including drug
companies, for example.

And the service that the National

Library of Medicine renders to this variety of constituents
is the same.

And that service is that they furnish, they

take a few subscriptions, as does the sister library, the
National Institutes of Health or NIH.

I mean no charge.

Qf course, it costs the taxpayer

Indeed, the Government pays the Xerox Corporation for

people who produce

And, of course, they do not pay the
and disseminate the material being copied.

QUESTION:

What did the practice used to be before

your Xerox?
MR.LATMAN:

The practice of individuals?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LATMAN:

Was namely to take notes by hand,and

then in the turn of the century and going up to the ethirt.les,
there was the system of photostats and rather elaborate system
of stockroom facilities which meant that until you got to the
era of Xerox, Hr. Justice Stewart, you had a situation where
it was impracticable and uneconomical and slow to reproduce
axi entire article.

And that's why we think that

all

those

methods — hand, typewriter, mimeograph, whatever the system
was — it was a system geared to taking notes, as wa all do,
of making an excerpt or taking a photostat of one page or a
chart.

Whereas the era of Xerox, which the parties seem to

admit really came in in the early 'sixties, I think that the

8
opinion below and the Government*s brief her, the Government’s
brief below, concedes the fact that in the early ’sixties,
late 'fifties, there was virtually no photocopying as we know
it today.
QUESTION;

Did the libraries, the National Library

and the National Institutes of Health, before the early 'sixties,
subscribe to more copies of your publications than they now do?
MR. L&TMAN;

No, I don't believe the record is

conclusive one way or another.

I don't think I can say they

subscribed to more. However, we have a few sequels, really.
One is this, that in certain areas, for example, one of the
journals in suit is called Journal of Immunology.

I suppose

we all recognize that in the era of transplants and in the
era of cancer research, and the like, that the interest in
immunology has so mushroomed that for subscriptions to stay
about the same, which in many cases they have, or for reprints,
which is an alternative form

that the publisher has.

That is,

the publisher doesn't only sell subscriptions; the publisher
is interested in disseminating this material, that is what it's
in the business of doing.

So that in addition to subscriptions,

it sells reprints, it licenses microfilm, which is another
convenient alternative form of utilization, and indeed it has
an authorized photocopying agency.

So that these alternative

forms which are needed to keep these very small base journals
alive ~ for example, take medicine or the Journal of Immunology.

9
Tiiere are four journals in suit.

And even though everyone

agrees these are the respected journals in their fields in idle
world, the journals that have subscriptions from three to
seven thousand, the subscription price for 5 to 12 issues are
$12 or $44.
The National Library of Medicine in achieving this
has a system of an overhead microfilm camera which swings up
and down the aisles of the stacks of the library to take
photographs of the journals.

In other words, one does not

even have to bring the journal out.

And I mention that only

to indicate that tills is an integral day-fcy--day operation.
Similarly, the National Institutes of Health have
four employees who do nothing else all day but grind out these
reprints.

And in the year in question in the record, it shows

that that operation at NIH with those four full-time employees
entails an expenditure of slightly more than the library spent
for acquisition of journals.
QUESTION?

Does the record show how many reprints

are supplied to each author of his article?
MR. LATMAN:

It does, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

It shows

that on the average about 300 reprints are furnished.
QUESTION:
MR. LATMAN:

Furnished free of -barge,
No, there is a certain amount that’s

free of charge, 25 or so and the rest are purchased.

Now, they

are purchased, and, of course, the amount of reprints that

10

ware purchased in the past used to be an indication of the
popularity of the article, something that the editors are
interested in.

But it isn’t any more, and we think the reason

it isn’t any more is that once the reprints which are furnished
by the author to people who request it are used up that the
people just photocopy.
' QUESTION:

What barriers are there, if any, to having

a person who desires one of these copies to writs to the
publisher, your client, and get a copy directly?
MR. LATMAN:

We don't think there is any barriers.

We think that in order to facilitate the situation, because
in the past it is hard to stock actual back copies, our client
has authorised two reprint houses to furnish reprints.

And,

secondly, as I indicated, a photocpying agency to furnish
people with that.

So that while there may be a barrier, we

think that the key is authorised photocopying.

Because, I

would like to emphasise to the Court in this situation that
the petitioner is not interested in stopping or slowing down
or faulting tills photocopying at all.

What the proprietor is

interested in doing is securing some reasonable royalty.
Therefore, Mr, Chief Justice, we think that working through
our licensed representative is one way.

If one would consider

that that's too slow and that that's a barrier, then the
alternative which we would prefer and which we have offered
is a blanket license covering all the journal articles which

11
could, be paid for by the library when they buy the subscription.
So far all the proposals we have made have been turned down
because, as our efforts show, when we tried to set up such a
system before the lawsuit, we were told that there would be no
system of royalties until the court ordered the Government to
do so.
QUESTION;

Mr. Latman, have you had this same

experience with private libraries?
MR. LATMAN;

Well, we have had almost a worse

experience, Mr. Justice White, in that we almost ran into a
boycotts

and I think I have appended to our brief, in our

experience.
The National Library of Medicine is, after all, a
well-respected agency.

We respect it greatly ourselves.

When

it suggested that any proposal to license during the pendancy
of this suit was somehow inelegant and improper,

the National

of Library of Medicine threatened to not only not take our
license, but to cease subscribing to the journals. That's of
record.

And when I say of record, I mean it's in a letter

which the Government called to the attention of the court and
which we thought would be helpful if we appended in full.
The private libraries indicated that they would follow suit.
Of course, the licenses that we are talking about
would extend to private libraries.

The Government, in effect,

has a compulsory license in this case, as the Court knows.

We

12
can't S3 top the Government.

We don't want to.

But the offer

of licensing has been extended, but we are told that we had
better not extend licenses or talk about licenses until there
was a definitive word on this case.

And that's why we are

here.
QUESTION:

Somewhere in this mass of briefs, perhaps

in one of the amicus briefs, there was a reference to the
Library of Congress.
MR. LATMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Could you clarify, if you know, what is

their practice with respect to furnishing full copies?
MR. LATMAN:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, their practice

is in direct and dramatic contrast to the libraries in
question.

They have a policy which was introduced into

evidence, the Library of Congress photoduplication, the key
to which is copyright material will ordinarily not be copied
without the signed authorisation of the copyright owner.
Exceptions to this rule may be made in particular cases or
responsibility for use is on the applier.

In other words, we

find that dramatically different, and w® suspect that it's
different for the same reasons that the libraries purport to
have ..limitations.

That is, that respect for the lax*?, respect

for the rights of property in copyright, particularly in these
journals.
QUESTION:

Does that apply to the public?

Does it

13
also apply to Members of Congress?
MR* LATMAN:
QUESTION:

Does \*hafc apply, Mr* Justice Marshall?
That rule you just read.

MR. LATMANi

I believe it does»

exceptions to their policy.

1 don't know of any

On the other hand, I am not

familiar with the practice with regard to a Member of Congress.
Of course, the purpose of the statute that we are
suing on is to immunize individuals within the Government and
to make the Government liable for Government use, xvhich might
possibly cover the
QUESTIONS

The two libraries you are talking about,

that's limited to Government use*
MR. LATMAN:

Not the National Library of Medicine.

The National Library —
QUESTION:

For example, if somebody in the National

Institutes of Health wants a copy of an article, you think
you should be paid for that?
MR. LATMAN:

Yes.

We think they should pay for it

just as they pay for the subscriptions they buy, just as they
pay for the microfilm editions, all of which are alternative
ways to use the journals, alternative ways to use it within
the meaning of the copyright law which provides exclusive
rights to print, reprint, and copy.

We think it's a copy

and we think it fulfills the policy of the copyright law
which is to grant economic incentives to publishers.

14
QUESTION;

So that if they have several thousand

people out there, they would have to buy several thousand —
HR. LATMAN;

No.

What they could do is to take a

license and pay literally a few more dollars a year in order
to get -—
QUESTION;

A few more thousand dollars each time

they did it.
MR. LATMAN:
QUESTION;

No.

No.

The proposal we —

What are we talking about?

Hov/ much

money are we talking about?
MR. LATMAN:

Well,, the proposal that we talked

about which we had to withdraw under the threat of boycott
that they indicated averaged about $3.65 a year for the
library for the life of that particular journal.

That would

wean that they could furnish each and every one of their
users with a copy.
QUESTION;
MR. LATMAN:

How much would that be per year?
Well, it would vary.

are talking about are small.but important.

The amounts we
For example, in

the case of Medicine, the subscription price is $12 a year,
libraries

probably account

or half of. the subscribers.

The

for most of the subscribers
So it would amount to perhaps

$10,000 a year to the publisher, which in terms of Medicine,
whose gross revenues are maybe $50,000 —
QUESTION;

That’s all the license 'would bring in is

15
$10,000 per year?
MR. LATMAN?

Thats s all it would bring in if it

were accepted.
QUESTION
MR. LATMAN:

Is that all we are talking about?
No„

We are talking about a lot more,

Mr. Justice Marshall, because —
QUESTION:

I'm trying hard to find out how much

more.
MR. LATMAN:

Well, it's hard to put a specific

dollars and cents tag on it.

The reasoxi I say — first of

all, I would like to say that $10,000 to the life of a
journal is extremely important.

But passing that, the petitioner

publishes, for example, 37 journals, and we are talking about
other people, as I indicated before.

I do not have an

estimate for you, Mr. Justice Marshall,on how much would be
involved if that particular license proposal was achieved.
We were and indicated and that we were completely open to any
variation of a licensing proposal.

They do pay Xerox Corpora-”

tion, as I said, per page, but we think per page is perhaps
a little too complicated.
QUESTION;

Of course, the Court, of Claims said that -»

7

Judge Davis said that the court didn't have the power to
compel you to license to a privata individual, and while you
might be willing to, some other person in a similar situation
might not.

16
MR. LATMAN:

Well, to begin with, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, a person in a similar situation, of course, suing
the Government has no alternative.

And the Government is a very

important subscriber and a very important factor here.
But, secondly, we think that if the Court of Claims
did what we think is the proper job, namely, to decide
reasonable compensation in this case — and this might even
give a hint as to what the answer might be to Mr. Justice
Marshall's question — that this would serve as a pilot
example to people as to what reasonable compensation would be.
I see no indication on the part of any of the publishers,
including the hundreds and hundreds wuc have joined as amicus
in this action, of any interest to stop this photocopying.
So that I think that if they went into court and, let's say,
went into court against a private individual, that the
standards set by the Court of C3.aim3 in this case would show
what reasonableness would be.
QUESTION:

And that’s what we would urge.

And the matter would be open for

Congressional regulation, too, I take it.
MR. LATMAN:

Well, it's been open for Congressional

regulation, Mr. Justice White, for many years.

I think the

Court probably became aware of that in the 'sixties.

I must

say that I spent a very pleasant year of my life in the
Copyright Office in 1958 across the street at the early days
of the revision when

I used to take good lunch hours here

17
listening to the arguments in .this Court.

And I'm still

«

waiting, and 1 think the Court is still waiting, for action.
But I think more important than that is that the
Court of Claims has really legislated.

The Court of Claims

ignored the fair use doctrine completely and in a sense, if
you read their three core propositions,, what they said was,
we think it might hurt this fellow more than that fellow.
We think they were wrong, and we show that we believe
that in our brief.

We think that it’s important that this is

a judge-jraade doctrine and that the fair use question, as we
have indicated at some detail in our brief, even if the most
recent movement — I was going to say gesture, which is
unfair and disrespectful — but I mean the most recent movement
in Congress towards revision were to become law, that the fair
use question before this Court would still be with us.

And

the reason it would be is that the Government argues that the
fair use doctrine excuses whereas they admit that this case is
different from any case in which the fair use doctrine has
been applied in the past.
We agree with that.

The fair u3e doctrine deals with

incidental use, as I indicated earlier, where the key question
in every case is, Does it substitute?

If a fellow writing a

biography of Howard Hughes decides to borrow from an earlier
work on the same subject and his work wouldn't substitute for
your getting and reading the original, he is and was

in the

18
Kosemont case held to be using it fairly.

And I agree.

But

where a high school teacher * instead of buying copies makes
his own arrangement and reproduces 48 copias for his students,
something which is indistinguishable from the situation here,
he is held infringing.

The reason 1 say indistinguishable,

is that the library speaks about one at a time, that they only
furnish it on© at a time.

1 submit to your Honors that one

at a time is a prototype.

One at a time is the way that a

bookstore sells books; one at a time is the way we sell to
subscribers,and to use the colorful language of the trial judge,
babies are still born one at a time but the world is becoming
overpopulated.

We don't think that one at a time changes it.

We thirik it's the accumulation.
Similarly, we don't think that the fact that the
Government is nonprofit changes things at all.

We think that

there are certain rights in the statute which are limited to
profit, such as performance rights that have been before the
Court.

There is also rights such as the ones we are talking

about where it is not.
The legislative history of this statute is important
because all Government use is nonprofit and most of it is
laudable.

And the activity in this ca.se is laudable.

that quite sincerely.

I say

But when Congress went to pass the

statute, maybe worrying about either the Congressman that was
asked about or someone else, they had a twofold purpose.

One

19
was to exempt the individual frca 3.iability, and the second was
to make the Government liable, because until 1960 you could not
sue the Government for copyright infringement.

And in the course

of that, the House report shows that the photocopying accelera­
tion that was coming into play in '59 and '60 was one of the
reasons they passed this statute.
The potential effect on this is severe.

We have

noted that seme of the things we were simply talking about at
the trial are now realities.

Consortia, networks of libraries

that are getting together at this stage because they are finding
that costs go up

and we are caught in that vicious cycle

ourselves — costs go up.

The audience we have is relatively

static, and photocopying gets cheaper.
subscription prices.

We can’t raise

That will just make the cycle more vicious.

If we raise it, more people will decide they would rather
photocopy.

The consortia intend to share, the Soviet Union

which has a practice of buying one or two copies of a journal
and furnishing, I would presume, millions or thousands of
scientists and others with it, are with us.

And as X said,

it is not the intention of petitioner to stop this, it’s an
intention and a request that its copyright he recognised.
We think that that would be consistant to the economic incentive
of Maser v. Stein issued by this Court.

We think it would

comport with the constitutional and statutory purpose of

20
copyright, and we think it would preserve the viability of
scientific journals,
QUESTION:

Mr. Latrnan, could I go back to ray former

question about reprints?

Does the record show what your

clients charge for a reprint?

Does it depend on the length

and so forth?
MR. LATMAN: I believe it does.
QUESTION:
MR. LATMAN:

Is it nominal?
I am not sure I know or whether the

record shows exactly what is charged.
QUESTION:

1 ask this because I know the tendency,

and I personally think it’s been abused greatly, of the
medical profession at least, and I think scientists in general,
to request almost’automatically with penny postcards -— it
used to be penny postcards — for thousands of reprints
literally and offering to pay no charge, expecting the author
to supply these.

And I suppose this, or does it, similarly

come in in a flow to the publisher?
MR. LATMAN:

It does, but we think that what's

happened, Mr. Justice Blackmun, is instead of doing it that
way, I have found similarly that people will indiscriminately
gather reprints but in the form of photocopies.

Sven though

we don't want, to stop this, we think that it's convenient,
in a certain sense it's a mixed blessing, and I think that
what really has happened is the very practice that you describe,

21
Mr. Justice Blackmun, is now in effect but through photocopying.
QUESTION;

It's not uncommon for judges, members of

this Court and others, to call on the Library of Congress for
a book, sometimes perhaps it's a book, of which they have only
one or a very few copies, at least I assume that, because
frequently we get a request, "Will you please return the book."
Well, sometimes instead of returning the book if we are not
finished with it, speaking personally, I have Chapter 13 or
Chapter 14 copied on the xerox machine. As far as I know
the Library of Congress has never sent photocopies of anything.
•They send the original.
Is the borrower running up against this statute
and these claims by making a copy for his own use, copyrighted
material?
MR. LATMAN:

That is a harder question which we

think is quite different from this case.
could, just give my opinion on that.

And therefore, I

Of course, to begin with,

there is an interesting phenomenon when your Honor mentions
a chapter.

The libraries will not — these libraries that we

are suing will not copy a chapter from a book.

When they

call it a book or a monogram — when the libraries classify
it as a book or a monogram, even the libraries we are suing
won't copy it.

They somehow see a distinction.

I think there

is a lot of significance to that fact, because the world didn't
come to an end when they didn't do that.

22

But let’s get back to the example.

It would be

harder — my opinion is that it would — first, my opinion Is
that nobody would sue.

And I think that's quite significant

here, because it’s impractical for anyone to sue, for a number
of reasons.
QUESTION:

Is it your opinion nobody would sue the

Chief Justice or that nobody would sue anybody?
(Laughter.)
MR. LATMAN:
an individual.

Nobody would sue the Chief Justice or

No one would sue an individual.

It's an

impractical medium —
QUESTION:

It's a damage claim.

Suppose I make

10 copies to send to my colleagues so that we would all be
sharing in that.

The recovery might be de minimus,so that

no one would have any incentive to.

MR. LATMAN:

Exactly.

It would be precisely that.

And therefore it is to be contrasted with the libraries here
which generata, coordinate, install

the machinery, decide,

incidentally, whether to photocopy or send you the original.
They make the decision.

They perform the operation, and they

have the microfilm camera, they print it themselves, and they
give it to you.

And the result is some 2 million pages a year

of journal articles being copied by these two libraries alone.
So that we can’t call it de minimus.
QUESTION:

It's so: much- faster than getting a

23
reprint.
ME. LATMAN:
QUESTION:

That the procedure is fast.
Faster than getting a reprint.

MR. LATMAN:

It. would be faster than getting a reprint

and that1 s why we encourage —
QUESTION:

It might be an emergency.

ME. LATMAN:

It might be, and that's why we encourage

the authorized licensing fee.

Just as they would have the

microfilm which is another alternative, that they have the
opportunity to do it quickly.

In fact, we think we have a

wiser way for them to do it.

They ought to make it off the

microfilm.

They shouldn't make different microfilms and

copies as they do.

We think that's wasteful.

They should have

the microfilm sitting there with a license to make copies.
QUESTION:

You don't want to run the library, do you?

You don’t want to do that, do you?
MR. LATMAN:

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

But I air. suggesting that when we are talking about economics,
which is all we are talking about here, there is a concession
by the NIH library, and that ail we are talking about is
budgetary considerations.

I am just trying to suggest how

in that context it would be fair, it would be proper, it would
be manageable, we think it would be very important in saving
the journals and enforcing the copyright law.
I would like to save whatever time I do have for

rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well»

Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. BORK
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BORK;
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Throughout most of this century libraries have

permitted their patrons to make single copies of articles
from journals, or have made such articles upon the request of
customers.

And not until new in this case has any publisher

or other copyright holder ever challenged that well-known
practice, that well-known means of providing access to
collections in libraries.
QUESTION;

General Bork, that doesn’t mean that

they haven’t complained about it, does it, surely.
MR. BORK;

There have been remarkably little

complaint, Mr. Justice Blaekmun.

I admit there has been some

But I think the complaint is generally directed at practices
other than that followed by the National Library of Medicine
and NIK here.
QUESTION;

Of course, I can’t testify, but I have

heard many complaints personally.
MR. BORK;

Well, I think there has been.

QUESTION;

Aren’t the level of complaints rising

in direct proportion to the number of photocopying machines

25
MR, BORKs

I think so, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think

the number of complaints have to do with practices other than
that followed by the National Library of Medicine and National
Institutes of Health.

One of petitioner's modes of arguing

this case is to lump together all photocopying practices with
the quite specific and limited practices followed by NLM and
NIH.

So I don't think the kind of practice we are examining

here today in this case is the kind of practice that does any
injury to the publishers in this industry or other industries.
QUESTION:

Let me suggest what is probably a simplistic

hypothetical proposition with a very obvious answer.

I am sure

the Library of Congress has got copies of many, many plays
and suppose someone wants to put on a play and they write in
and get one copy and then make a hundred copies.

There is a

copyright problem there for the use of that play, is there not?
MR. BORK:

I have no doubt, Mr. Chief Justice, that

that is a clear infringement.

That is a practice totally

unlike the practice followed by the National Library of
Medicine.
QUESTION:

Is it different because

the medium of

use is different?
MR. BORK:
of reasons.

Oh, it's different for a complete variety

One is the noncommercial use here.

Another, I

must say, is that these photocopied articles are in no sense
substitutes for a subscription to petitioner’s journals.

They

26
are not substitutes.

If you were a worker in a research

field, you will subscribe, and do subscribe and indeed get
subscriptions through the professional associations you belong
to of the main journals in your field, and keeping abreast of
your field and its developments cannot be done by sending off
for the occasional photocopy to the Library of Medicine.
So that what the Library of Medicine provides is
not a substitute for subscriptions in your field.
does provide are other things.

What it

It provides that when an

article of direct interest to your work appears in a journal
you never anticipated it would appear in, peripheral journal,
or perhaps a journal from another specialty which has a cross
feed into your field, or perhaps an out-of-date issue of
your own that you no longer have.

That is the kind of copying

the National Library of Medicine does.
QUESTION:

Well, if X am interested in the first

act of the Mikado, I suppose X could say that the first act
of the Mikado isn't a substitute for the whole operetta so
I will just copy the first act, and it's not a substitute.
Would that be fair use?
MR. BORK;
Rahnquist.

It might well not be fair use, Mr. Justice

My primary answer to it is that is not this case.

This case involves copying that I think has no effect upon
the petitioner's subscription list.
Something is happening to the subscription lists of

27
medical journals and what: will continue to happen is data flow
through computers and other means increases.

But that’s not

because of the photocopying practices of the National Library
of Medicine.

;-

I was merely pointing out that the ability to get a
photocopy is no substitute for a subscription to the journals
in your field.

On the other hand# you cannot subscribe —

the National Library of Medicine ha3 18 ,.000 journals it
subscribes to.

One doesn't know for sure where in that range

of journals an article that might be relevant to one's research
will appear.

To tell a man that he must subscribe to any

substantial fraction# any small fraction of that number of
journals is to tell him that he cannot have the article.

And

that is —
QUESTION:

Is it quite that broad?

Perhaps it means

he can have a copy of that article for 75 cents instead of
getting it for nothing.
MR. BORK:

Oh# if we —

QUESTION:

So that the publisher gets some sort of

a royalty.

I don't know what the amounts would be.

the issue.

That's v/hat we are here —*
MR. BORK:

That's

That's correct# Mr. Chief Justice, and to

that I have two answers:

One is that there is no infringement

of the Copyright Act here# either because the Copyright Act
doesn't cover this practice# or because it is covered by fair

28
use,

And I, think that's fairly clear.
My other answer is that we are here dealing with a

status quo in medical research, which is enormously complex.
This is not a problem that is homogenous, and the petitioner
offers us a tiny slice of a total px-ofolem and asks for a
sweeping rule that is going to upset the status quo in medical
research.
QUESTION:

Twenty years ago what would you guess

would be the number of copies that were furnished out of
the medical library, if the medical library was in existence
then.
MR. BORK:

No.

QUESTION:

NIH was, I guess, wasn't it?

MR. BORK:

NIH may have been, Mr. Chief Justice.

I don’t know — NIH only furnishes copies to its own researchers
It is not the outside use, is the National Library of Medicine.
And for a while the increase in photocopying did increase until
about 1968.

Then it took a dip, and I think it is now back

up somewhere near the 1968 level.

But it has been a strong

factor for some time.
But I think — it’s important for me to say that
this has been a practice which has been understood not to
violate the Copyright Act of 1909 for decades.

Our brief

refers to, and I will not take us through, evidence of that.
The gentlemen's agreement of 1935 which is answered by a

29

statement that x^e are not bound by it, nobody suggested the
petitioner is bound by that agreement.

One does suggest that

it indicates an understanding of practices at that time.

The

Sound and Recording Act of 1371 which we discuss i.n our brief
on pages 18 and 19 X will not take time now to point out, but
that is evidence that Congress said two things;

That people

may make recordings for their personal use from copyrighted
recordings without violating the Act, and that the reason they
left people free to do that was that they didn't want to give
copyright protection broader than other holders of copyrights
had, which would seem to be a statement by Congress that they
understood the 1909 statute not to extend to noncommercial
copying for private use.
But v/e need not, X think, spend our time rehearsing
the long practice or taking gleanings from legislative under”
standing, because I think there are two cases in this Court
that are quite parallel, and I refer to Fortnightly Corporation
v. United Artists Television and Te.lep romp ter v. CBS.

Those

were cases of community antenna television systems which xvenfc
out and picked up signals from stations licensed to telecast
motion picture film, relayed them to their own subscribers
whom they charged to receive these films, and they paid no
royalties and had no license — no royalties to or license from
the owner of the copyright.
Wow, that was infringement alleged under sections

30
1(c) and 1(d) that give the exclusive right to perforin in
public for profit and perform publicly.
Nov/, this Court held that it must really decide
whether the CATV function fell upon the performers, the
broadcaster side of the line, or on the viewer’s side of the
line.

And it said essentially a CATV system no more than

enhances the viewer’s capacity to receive the broadcaster’s
signal, and it used an analogy which I think is quite
appropriate here.

Indeed, I think these two cases I am relying

upon are much broader than anything I ask this Court to hold
here.
This Court said in Fortnightly, "If an individual
erected an antenna on a hill, strung a cable to his house
and installed the necessary amplifying equipment, he would
not be performing the programs he received on his television
set.

The only difference in the case of CATV is the antenna

system is owned and operated not by its users, but by an
entrepreneur."
The analogy to this case is striking.
QUESTION0,

Except, Mr. Solicitor General, the only

thing to be decided in those two cases was the meaning of the
word "perform" under the 1907 Act.

I can understand that

casual readers of the opinion, perhaps, particularly in view
of the dissenting opinions, might have thought those cases
had to do with something else.

But all they were directed to

31

was the meaning of the statutory word "perform*.
we have the statutory word "copy".

And now hare

And certainly there isn’t

any ambiguity about that.
MR. BORK:

I think there is, Mr. Justice Stewart.

That’s precisely my point.

X think we have the same kind of

ambiguity in this case as you had in Fortnightly and in
Teleprompter.

The reason for that is this;

We know, as a

matter of law, that copy does not mean that the making of
any copy violates the Copyright Act.
be no doctrine of fair use.

If it did, there would

You must decide if it did there

would not have bean a long practice agreed to of individual
persons making copies for a variety of things.

So we know

that one must construe the word "copy" as not a word that
applies itself in a dictionary sense.
Act.

We know that about the

Therefore, it seems to me we have to draw a distinction

much like that involved in Fortnightly which asks is this
like viewing or is it like sending, performing?

Here I think

we have to ask is this like what the reader does properly under
fair use or is it like publishing?
are quite analogous in that sense.

I think the situations

I grant that they construe

different words.
QUESTION;

The United States is taking the position,

then, that this simply isn't copying and that we don't even
need to reach the fair use issue?
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

We take the view that

32
it is not —
QUESTION:

Is that in your brief?

MR. BORIC:

In our brief we say in a footnote citing

some other briefs and some of these cases I am now discussing
that it is argued persuasively that.

The primary reliance

of our brief is upon fair use.
Conceptually, Mr. Justice White, I don’t know that
it makes a great deal of difference because I learned from
Mr. Batman’s article on the subject that the law is not
entirely clear whether fair use means there is no infringement
it
or whether fair use means that/is an excused infringement.
And to say that the Act doesn’t cover it and in any event it
is fair use may be a redundancy or may not.
QUESTION:
history of the Act.

But it does direct you to some of th©
And you Gould arrive at this conclusion

without ever having had a fair use doctrine.
MR. EORK:

That’s true.

That is true.

That is true.

But I think that it’s inescapable that the word "copy” must
be construed unless we are prepared to say that there is no
doctrine of fair use for anybody who copies something out of
an article or something out of a book.

We know that is not

the law.
QUESTION:

There is quite a difference between

copying a couple of paragraphs and quoting it and copying
the whole thing, isn’t there?

33
MR. BORK:

There is quite a difference.

I think

there is no difference in practical result in this case because
a couple of paragraphs is no substitute for the whole.
QUESTION:

Well, sometimes a. copyright owner will,

for example, a syndicated columnist or the writer of an article,
will have some sort of a footnote saying that up to 700 words
may be used out of this article by permission of the copyright
owner.
MR. BGRKs

That is correct.

QUESTION;

So that suggests that for many purposes

there is regarded to be quite a difference under copyright lav/.
MR. BORK:

It may be regarded as quite a difference.

I think the reason the owner may do that is he regards 700
v/ords as not a substitute for the whole.

And one of my points

here, which I cannot stress too strongly, is that a reprint of
a single article is not a substitute for what petitioner
sells, which is a journal.

The: National Library of Medicine

will not. xerox that journal, will not xerox half of that
journal.
QUESTION:

Don't you occasionally have journals,

though, that may have one very important lead article that
might comprise two-thirds of the journal?
MR. BORK:

That may occur, Mr. -~

QUESTION:

It's true in the Law Review certainly.

MR. BORIC:

Yes, it is

34
QUESTION:

And would you sav ifc is a fair use to copy

the lead article ~MR. BORKs

As I understand the National Library

of Medicine’s policy, they will not copy as much as half of
a journal, so I would guess that ‘that policy would not cover
copying all of such an article.

But I cannot answer the

question definitely.
QUESTION:

But it is true that the of this material

could not get it free from the National Library of Medicine.
He would have to pay something, 25 cents or a dollar for
a reprint, isn’t it?
MR. BOR1;':

That is true.

Maybe I should address

that question directly, because I.think the more important
thing here is what is going to happen to medical research
information flow.
case.

Indeed, information flow in general.

This

It should be stressed that petitioner is seeking a

flat, sweeping rule which if applied to this case will cover
hundreds of other cases we know not of now.

The Court of

Claims decision which we are trying to uphold is quite narrow,
quite limited, and will have no such sweeping effect.

And

that is one reason I think the Court of Claims should be
confirmed, and Congress left to this task.
Arid I must say it is not true that Congress has
not been addressing this.

Now on the floor of the House

are two bills passed by the Senate, one of which would

35

establish a commission to study this very problem, the other
of which addresses this problem in substantive terms.

I

happen to prefer the commission approach because this problem
is far more complex than w© have given it credit for here.
There are any number of differences in scholarship and in
subsidisation of journals and in competing interests here that
are not reflected in this record and cannot be reflected in a
record of litigation like this.
QUESTIONS

So that —

Why won't the Medical Library copy an

entire journal?
MR. BORKs

Well, I think, Mr. Justice White, that

tiie reason that they respect petitioner's copyright ■—
QUESTION:

On what?

MR. BORKs

He has .a

copyright interest on each

article — by the way, there is left open in this case the
question of who does own these copyrights.
QUESTION:

I know, but copyright attaches to each

article, I take it, and yet ths library is not reluctant to
copy an entire article.
MR. BORK:

No, but what petitioner sells is a journal.

QUESTION:

I know, but we are talking about a

copyright, we are talking copyright, not whether — not
subscriptions.
MR. BORK:

For the reasons I am arguing today, Mr.

Justice White, the National Library of Medicine believes that

36
it is not infringing a copyright when it does that.
QUESTION s

QUESTIONS

reprints?

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
petitioner.

Let me say this,

We are talking here not just about the

We are talking about five or six hundred

publishers of medical journals in very different circumstances.
We are talking about thousands of libraries.

Petitioner

seeks a rule that will apply to all of those publishers who
will be able, if they wish, to get injunctions against
private libraries, although not against Government libraries.
If petitioner gets this rule, we can then begin negotiation.
I can't imagine the negotiation that would be involved between
thousands of libraries and five or size hundred publishers,
all with very different interests, very different views of
the matter and very different appetites for gain.
QUESTION:

Now, there is a statute on record piracy,

I have forgotten the particular statute, that provides an
automatic licensing.

If there is a hit record, you or I or

anyone else who are in the business of making records may copy

37
it without the consent of the copyright owner,, but we have
to keep a written record of how many copies we make and pay
him, I think the statute provides, 5 cents for each copy.
Would that not be a feasible mechanism here?
MR. BORK:

I think it may be feasible, Mr. Chief

Justice, but let me tell you why I think it ought not to be
imposed by a rule of court rather than by a rule of legislature.
I have just suggested a reason why I think —
QUESTION:

We haven’t come to that point yet whether

a court has got any power.
i

MR. BORIC:

this question.

You are going to discuss that —

I think this is tied in intimately with

I have just suggested why I think that this

proposed solution of give us this hard and fast rule and we
will go out there and negotiate is no solution, because w
think the negotiations will break down,too many libraries,
too many other interests involved.

So that what we have is

an invitation to chaos, not an invitation to order in the
industry.
But let us assume, along the lines of your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, that such an agreement were possible or
that such an agreement were imposed by rule of Court, the
only tiling that is going to happen immediately is that there
will be a much greater burden of compliance upon libraries,
not just a burden of the royalties which would be quite
substantial, because the numbers we are talking about as

small happen to be royalties for four journals in one library.
Now, if you add the 18,000 journals in thousands of libraries,
we are talking about a large increase in the cost of medical
research dissemination over the current practice.

In

addition to that there will be a very heavy burden of
compliance by the libraries as they have to check out and
add administrative apparatus to count photocopying instances.
Now, what that’s going to mean is that the holdings
of libraries around this country, medical libraries around
this country, are going to be cut back sharply, not the
National Library of Medicine.

The National Library of Medicine

I am sure can get an appropriation to pay whatever it costs
and, indeed, the National Library of Medicine is now paying
the higher price for petitioner's journals and it has agreed
to do so.

The National Library of Medicine is not going to

cut back or these journals, but the National Library of Medicine
is trying to encourage holdings and has been encouraging
holdings, in fact, has spent $12.25 million for grants for
acquisitions to libraries around this country, much of which
is spent on subscriptions for petitioner’s and others' journals,
so it's increasing the subscriptions out in regional and
local libraries.
This rule that petitioner seeks is going to increase
the royalties greatly.

It's going to increase the burdens

of compliance and costs in libraries, the number of smaller

39
journals held by libraries is going to be cut back drastically
even if they don't raise their own subscription price or try
to license themselves, because library budgets are going to
be eaten up.
Nov;, maybe that’s what should happen.
peripheral journals should go out of business.

Maybe
Maybe a

Darwinian approach to this thing is the correct approach.

I

am merely suggesting that that s a choice that really ought
to be made, that’s a change in the status quo and with drastic
results for medical research dissemination, and that's the
choice that should foe made, I suggest, by the Congress rather
than by a court.
QUESTION:

I think your brother's point on the other

side is that choice has been made by Congress.
MR. BORK:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, if if has been

made by Congress, it's a choice that has not been enforced
for 50 or 60 years while copying practices have been going on
and grov/ing.

It's a choice that is not reflected in Congress 3

understanding of what it was-doing in the 1971 Sound Recording
Act.

I don’t think it is a choice.that has been made by

Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s what this case ±3 about.

MR. BORK:

That is true.

That'is true.

But I do

think that one of the things this case is about on a fair use
question is — fair use, after all, is basically a constitutional

40
doctrine.

It asks whether a rigid conceptualised application

of the Copyright Act would in fact retard the progress of
science as a useful art.

And when I address myself to this

question, I am talking about what would happen to medical
research and what is not happening to petitioner despite his
claims.

I am talking about fair use.
QUESTIONS

Are you suggesting that Congress would

be constitutionally obligated to incorporate a doctrine of
fair use into the copyright law?
MR. BORK:

That is debatable.

I have seen it

I don't know that

I need to •— well, I —
QUESTION;

I thought you 3aid a moment ago that

fair use was a constitutionally —
MR. BORK;

The courts have derived their power to

evolve a doctrine of fair use from the constitutional value,
the constitutional principle.

Whether or not the court could

second-guess Congress' decision about what would promote
rather them retard, I don't know.

Certainly that's not involved

in this case.
But when 1 talk about harm to medical research and

of business.

Nov?, it says these journals may go out

There is nothing in the record about that.

In

fact, common sense indicates that they won't, for the reasons
we have talked about, the reasons that photocopying doesn't
substitute for subscriptions.
QUESTION?

Is that a demonstrable proposition or

simply an arguable one?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, X think it's about

as demonstrable, if I may make a comparison, as market
definition in antitrust cases.

One looks at these two things

and it is apparent in this industry, photocopies of single
articles serve a different function and a different market
than journal subscriptions.

They complement rather than

substitute for each other, and therefore I think are in
different markets.
I suppose, had petitioner taken this trial into the
question of how much it was injured, we might have a record
on these points.

But we have here only petitioner's rather

dire speculation about his future, and that's the only record
on injury.
QUESTION:

If I understand petitioner's position,

42

they don’t want to curtail the dissemination of information,
medical or scientific»

They simply want a piece of the pie,

as it were.
MR. BORK:
curtail it.

Mr. Chief Justice, they are bound to

If they get this rule, we will then have a chaotic

situation in negotiation with thousands of parties in interest.
If that negotiation comes out the way they want it to, we are
going to have a dramatic impact on the peripheral journals,
not upon petitioner’s journals, petitioner's journals are
not peripheral.

The libraries will continue to stock them,

there is no doubt about it.

But peripheral journals are going

to find that library budgets have shrunk and they are not going
to be sold.
QUESTION;

I take it what you are saying is that

this can only be resolved, or this ought only be resolved, by
Congress doing something like what they have done with the
mandatory copying of records.
MR. BORK;

Well, Congress doing something of that

sort or perhaps making a solution that differentiates among
the different interests involved here.
I should mention that the Library of Congress through
its copyright office is now holding conferences, including
international conferences to comment in an effort to arrive at
norms in this quite complex situation, norms which may perhaps
be translated into legislation.

43

I should also say one further thing which X think
shows how little petitioners really are talking about here.
There are over 400,000 volumes of journals, not individual
issues, volumes of journals, in the NLM holdings.
there were 93,000 articles photocopied.

Now, in 1370

That is less than one™

fourth of one request per volume of journals held.

When you

look at this thing spread across the number of journals, sure,
there are men '

microfilming constantly in one library.

But when you look at the universe of what they are copying from
and see how its impact is negligible upon the individual
journals —
QUESTION:

In one breath you say the thing is going

to result in chaos and then in the next breath you say how
negligible it is.
MR. BORK:

Yes, that’s right, Mr. Justice Relinquish,

and I confess that I think both of those breaths are internally
consistent, yes.
I'm pointing out that it's negligible as an impact
upon an individual journal by showing how thinly it is spread
across this vast storehouse of medical information in journals.
It is crucial to individual researchers here and there who
need a particular article in an obscure, peripheral magazine
or in some other magazine or in a back number they have lost
or a specialty they don't belong to.
crucial.

For that research it is

The effect at one end upon medical research is quite

44
important.

The effect at the other end upon subscriptions

to journals is infinitesimal, if it exists.

There is no showing

in this record that it exists.
I think I would quote the Teleprompter decision about
the facts that the detailed regulation of what was involved
here cannot be solved really by litigation and a flat rule.
It requires something much more sensitive.

And I suggest, for

tiie reasons I have given, that both the law and the policy of
