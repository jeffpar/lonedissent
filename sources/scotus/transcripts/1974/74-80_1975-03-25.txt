PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

next in No. 74-80, Kugler against Helfant consolidated with
74-277» Helfant against Kugler.
Mr. Baime, you may proceed whenever your are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. BAIME, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BAIME:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
This case comes before this Court on a petition
and cross-petition for certiorari to review a judgment
tendered by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
sitting en banc.

That judgment reversed an order entered

by the United States District Court dismissing Respondent’s
complaint pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(6) and denying his
application for preliminary Injunctive relief.
At issue here is the propriety of federal inter­
vention in an ongoing state criminal prosecution.
More specifically, the question to be resolved is
whether the New Jersey Supreme Court’s conference with the
Respondent, which allegedly had the effect of coercing him
to testify before the -State Grand Jury9 constituted such
extraordinary circumstances as to compel federal intervention
and a resulting disruption of legitimate state criminal

4
processes.
For the purpose of this argument, the material
facts are not In dispute and are essentially a matter of
public record.
Respondent, a member of the New Jersey bar and a
former municipal court judge, alleged in a verified complaint
filed under the Civil Rights Act, that he had been subponaed
to appear before the State Grand Jury on October 18, 1972.
Pursuant to that subpoena. Respondent appeared and
was then advised that he was the target of the Grand Jury’s
investigation. -Armed with that information, he being fully
apprised of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, the
Respondent refused to enter the Grand Jury room.
,

• ‘1

;

He vras then brought before a Superior Court judge
r.

who, following argument in open court, ordered him to appear
in the Grand Jury room and to assert his Fifth Amendment
i;

•

‘

privilege, if that was his desire.
The Respondent then entered the Grand Jury room
and refused to testify.

This matter then came to the

attention of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.
In the interim, however, it had become apparent
that the Grand Jury’s inquiries concerned other matters in
which the Respondent was allegedly involved.
Ho was therefore resubponaed to appear before the
Grand Jury on November 8, 1972.

The Supreme Court of New

5
Jersey, having scheduled oral arguments on that dates
requested the presence of Judge Halfant and Judge Moore,
who was also implicated in the criminal scheme, at its
private conferenee room.
The object of that conference was to determine
whether removal or disciplinary proceedings were to be
commenced against either or both judges.

Both Judge

Moore —
QUESTION:
MR. BAIME:

They were municipal judges?
Yes, your Honor.

I should say,

however, that the Grand Jury’s investigation involved as
well an Atlantic County court judge.
QUESTION:

And these municipal judges were in

Atlantic County?
MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And in New Jersey a municipal judge

can be a part-time judge, can he not -MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— and practice law so long as he

doesn't practice in what, criminal courts?
MR. BAIME:

He may not practice in criminal

courts or have anything to do with the penal law.

That

includes disorderly persons violations, et cetera.
QUESTION:
MR. BAIME:

Was the Grand Jury sitting in Trenton?
I’ m

sorry —?

6
QUESTION:
MR. BAIME:

Was the Grand Jury sitting in Trenton?
Yes* it was.

The Grand Jury was

located on the same floor as the conference room of the
Supreme Court.

Now, both Judge Moore —

QUESTION:

Does the subpoena power of the Grand

Jury sitting in Trenton extend over to Atlantic County?
MR. BAIME:

Oh, yes.

This wa3 a state grand jury

which has state laws of jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. BAIME:

I see.
Both Judge Moore, who had previously

waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and had testified
previously before the Grand Jury and Judge Helfant who, as
I have noted, had refused — appeared as requested.
Both judges agreed not to sit pending resolution
of the Grand Jury's investigation.
Respondent’s complaint alleged that the effect of
this conference on him was to coerce him to testify before
State Grand Jury.

All parties agree that his testimony

was wholly exculpatory.
Nevertheless, the Grand Jury returned an indictment
charging him with substantive offenses and with four counts
of false swearing.
Based upon these allegations, Respondent sought an
injunction in the United States District Court enjoining
prosecution of the state charges.

7
Following an evidential hearing, the District
Court dismissed Respondent’s complaint, pursuant to the
rule 12(b)(6) and denied his application for a preliminary
injunction.
Specifically, the Court concluded that the
complaint

was barren if anything, which would indicate

bad faith or harrassment on the part of New Jersey’s
prosecutorial authorities.
So, too, the District Court was unwilling to
presume that the entire state judicial system would be
infected
nocuously affected by virtue of the Supreme Court’s
involvement in the upper facts of the case.
A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal sub­
sequently reversed.

Following reargument, the Court of

Appeals, in an en banc decision, ordered an evidentiary
hearing to determine whether Respondent’s will not to
testify had been overborne and further ordered findings of
.i&ct and conclusions in the form of a ceclaratory judgment.
We submit that the Court of Appeals en banc
decision calling for a declaratory relief ignored timehonored principles of federalism and

comedy as enunciated

by this Court in Younger against Harris and Samuels against
Macke11.
We recognize, of course, at the outset that for
the purpose of this argument, all reasonable and legitimate

8
inferences must be assumed in favor of the Respondent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Balme, may I a3k — I notice that

the Respondents and cross-Respondente *— Chief Justice
Weintraub, he is no longer Chief Justice.
MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:

That Is true.
Associate Justice Nathan L. Jacobs, he

is retired.
MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Associate Justice Hayden Proctor, he

is retired.
MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:

True.
Associate Justice Frederick W. Hall.

Has he retired?
MR. BAIME:

He has

retired.

He has two decisions

which will be Issued in about eight days, but he no longer
will be sitting In cases in the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Now, the others are Justice Worral F.

Mountain and Justice Mark A. Sullivan.

They are still in

action.
MR. BAIME:

They presently serve in their official

capacities in the State of New Jersey.
QUESTION:

Well, do those changes bear on the

Issue here?
MR. BAIME:

Well, as we note in our brief — and I

think It is made clear by the decision in Spomer against

9
Littleton« the case with respect to seven, or perhaps six
of the main defendants surely is moot.
These Individuals were sued, not in their
official capacities but by virtue of a conclusionary
allegation of personal vindictiveness on their part and as
noted in Stromberg against Littleton, those allegations
must die along with the resignation of those public
officials.
Therefore, only two of the Defendants presently
serve in New Jersey and, of course, according to the
allegations in the complaint, only one of the tiv'o in any
way actively participated in this conference*
We submitted in our brief that under these
circumstances —
QUESTION:

Well, do you understand that Judge

Helfant’s whole case turns on that conference in the
Supreme Court conference room?
MR. BAIME:

Yes.

I shouldn’t say his whole case because we also
argue that the corecion issue is wholly irrelevant to the
validity of the State Court indictment.
By that I mean, finding of coercion would in no
way vitiate the false swearing charges.
QUESTION:

Well, you suggested earlier that the

allegations of bad faith and harr&ssment were against the

10
prosecutorial

official.

MR. BAIME:

That is the way we understand the

Respondent’s complaint.
QUESTION:

Well, that is more than just harrassment

and consequence of this meeting with the Supreme Court,
isn’t it?
MR. BAIME:

Yes, but I should point out that in

New Jersey, not only has the composition of the Supreme Court
changed, but we have a new attorney general as well.
Former Attorney General Kugler has since resigned
and so has Deputy Attorney General Hayden.
I might point out at this point that the purpose
of an injunction and, indeed, declaratory relief as well is
to prevent a future violation of the law, not to rectify a
wrong already done.
We submit that under the facts that presently
exist, Respondent’s complaint simply does not satisfy the
great intermediate harm requirement enunciated by this
Court in Younger against Harris.

When viewed within the

factual context as it presently exists, it is quite clear
that Respondent’s allegations amount to nothing more than a
mere academic exercise and a conceivable.
Plainly, there was nothing ominous in the Supreme
Court’s conference with Judge Helfant.
As we pointed out in our brief, it is

incumbent

11

upon the Supreme Court of New Jersey to Initiate disciplin­
ary and removal proceedings and as the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit has itself acknowledge in Ds Vita
against Sills3 that significant Constitutional obligation
cannot ordinarily await the conclusion of belated criminal
charges pending against a Judge or lawyer.
Rather, that Constitutional obligation of the
Supreme Court is to insure both the appearance and

fact of

judicial integrity.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, Mr. BAlme, even

as to the sitting justices, Mountain and Sullivan, they
could be replaced by Superior Court judges in any matter
groxtflng out of this, couldn’t they?
MR. BAIME:

Yes, your Honor.

Yes, we pointed

that out in our briefs as well.
I might point out further that the Court of
Appeals’

opinion is premised upon the conclusion that

those Judges or Justices who might in some way be unable to
remain impartial by virtue of their

official involvement

in this caso — under New Jersey law must accuse themselves.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, conferences of this

kind, are they unusual?
MR. BAIME:

No, they are not unusual.

They

occur on the average of — this isn't in the record, your
Honor.

It is from reviewing the files of the Supreme
f

12
Court but —*
QUESTION:

Well, when I sat on the

New Jersey

Supreme Court we had such conferences.
MR. BAIME:

I believe Chief Justice Vanderbilt was

chief justice at that time and that is true.

This is not an

unusual practice.
The obligation of the Supreme Court to initiate
disciplinary proceedings certainly cannot be handled In a
conjectural way.

Rather, the Supreme Court should make some

initial finding that at least proceedings are warranted.
As I have noted in the brief, here the Respondents’
agreement not to sit pending resolution of the Grand Jury
charges obviated the need to determine whether removal or
suspension proceedings were to be commenced.
For that reason, there Is no order to show cause
In this case, nor was there ever a hearing with respect to
suspension or removal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Baime, when did the alleged false

swearing occur?
MR. BAIME:

The false swearing occurred in the

■Grand Jury room.
QUESTION:
MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:
weren’t there?

At the first Grand Jury hearing.
I’m sorry, I don’t understand you.
There were two

Grand Jury hearings.

13
MR. BAIME:

Yes.

In the first Grand Jury hearing

on October 18th, 1972, the Respondent refused to testify.
At the second hearing, he testified with respect
to three unrelated transactions* after being apprised on
each occasion that he was the target of Grand Jury inquiry
and advised further as to the scope of what that investi­
gation was.
On the second occasion, he testified in a manner
which we submit constitutes false swearing which is similar
to perjury.
QUESTION:

n

MR. BAIME:
QUESTION:
v-

That was the second hearing* then.
Yes.
That's right.

'

>• 5

MR. BAIME:
out that the

-

With regard to that* we would point

coercion issue is, again, wholly irrelevant

to the criminal proceedings pending against Respondent.
Simply stated* there is no reason to assume,
even giving the fact that there is wholesale contamination
in the state Judiciary that any member of that state
Judicial system will ever be confronted with the issue of
having to determine whether the

Supreme Court in fact

coerced this Respondent.
The reason* I think, is quite obvious.
With respect to the false swearing charges* it
is clear that Fifth Amendment privilege does not endow a

witness 'who is compelled to testify with a license to commit
perjury with impunity.

Rather, this Court has repeatedly-

construed the Fifth Amendment as applying only to evidence
of past criminal transgressions, beginning with such cases
as Gllckstein against the United States and, going through
Dennis against the United States, Bryson against United States»
' and only recently, United States against Knox.
This Court has made it abundantly clear that a
witness/ even if compelled to testify, may not take the law
in his own hands and violate his oath with impunity and that
is what vre allege this witness did.

..

Therefore, the question of coercion is wholly

ir­

relevant, even assuming coercion to false swearing charges
would not be vitiated.

The same principles apply with equal

force when you are considering the efficacy of that part of
the indictment charging the Respondent with the substantive
crimes.
I should point out that those crimes for conspiracy
to obstruct justice, obstruction of Justice and compounding a
felony, this Court has often upheld the principle that
reception before a Grand Jury of even unconstitutionallyobtained evidence does not serve to vitiate substantive
charges but rather, the remedy under those circumstances is to
suppress the use and fruits of that testimony so that the
testimony may not be used at the Defendants’ criminal trial.

15
Again, I submit that United States against Blue
is directly dispositive of the issue there. Specifically,
the injunction — rather, the indictment with regard to
the substantive counts is Insulated from attack upon the
ground that Respondents Grand Jury

testimony was un­

constitutionally obtained and therefore it is quite clear
that an Injunction which would be tantamount to dismissal
of these charges would be most inappropriate.
Rather, the only fear that Respondent has is that
at some future point, based on a hypothetical series of
events which in all likelihood would occur, the state, for
some reasons I cannot fathom, will utilize this Grand Jury
testimony against him.
Nov;, we have pointed out that his Grand Jury
testimony, being wholly exculpatory, would not serve as a
declaration against penal interest under New Jersey’s
evidentiary lav/.

Nor would it serve as admission against

interest and I refer also to the fact that we made a
binding stipulation before the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit that we do not intend to introduce the
Respondent’s Grand Jury testimony against him, other than,
of course, with respect to crime of false swearing.
Again, I po3.nted out in my brief, that concession
or that stipulation is not engendered by an overwhelming
feeling of actualism.

The point I am making, again, is that

16
the Respondent’s Grand Jury testimony in this case is

wholly

exculpatory.
Therefore, the prospect that there will be
is
constitutional injury in this case/ based on pure speculation.
It is wholly conjectural and certainly, under these circum­
stances, Respondent’s complaint does not satisfy the great'
and immediate harm requirement set forth in Younger and Harris.
QUESTION!

Mr. Baime, you earlier referred to the

Third Circuit as having provided for a declaratory judgment
but they also preliminarily enjoined the prosecution of the
state proceedings pending that determinations didn’t they?
MR. BAIME:

That is true.

I would point out further

that here a declaratory judgment would certainly be as
abrasive as an injunction for the reasons pointed out in
Stoffel against Thompson, Samuels against Macke11 and
Mr. Justice-Sherman's concurring — or I should say, separate
opinion in Peres against Ledesma.
Firstly, there is a question under Section 2102
whether ah injunction could be Issued to enforce declaratory
judgment.

I know your own views on that Issue.
Of course, there Is some disagreement.
Secondly, a declaratory Judgment might well have

some res adjudicata effect, some binding effect upon the
state courts.

**

" ..•

Thirdly, assuming thlt the declaratory Judgment

17
would not be binding upon the state courts, that solely
means that a declaratory judgment here would encourage
duplication of legal proceedings.
QUESTION:

Why do we need to wrestle with the

refinements of the declaratory judgment aspect of this
since the Third Circuit actually directed the issuance of
an injunction?
MR. BAIME:
have to.

That is true.

I don’t think we

I just — I do think that judges, lawyers and

prosecutors are guided not only by the letter of the law as
enunciated by this Court

and the Court of Appeals but the

spirit as well and again, vie submitted that Younger’s
interjection is based on something more than a technical
rule.

It is based on hundreds of years of federalism in

common and those principles have been reaffirmed time and
time again by this Court only recently.
This Court had occasion, I believe it was last
’week, to come down

with the Huffman against Pursue decision

which, again, jriludes to the fact that we simply cannot
assume that members of a.state judicial system will fail
or refuse to obey the law they are bound to enforce.
That is the presumption upon which Respondent’s
complaint rests and we submit that it is wholly conjectural
and incorrect.
In conclusion, I would point out that the issue

18
here is not whether a citizen is to be

denied access to the

federal courts for disposition 0f its constitutional claims.
We have maintained throughout these proceedings that
habeas corpus and certiorari proceedings provide a litigant
with proper remedies for significant constitutional violations.
Those remedies do not call for massive disruption and
dislocation of legitimate state criminal processes.
At issue here, rather, is the state sovereign
power and right to

try hnd accuse without delay.

We contend that a balancing of competing values in
this case clearly calls for the application of the abstention
doctrine.
We therefore, accordingly, urge the reversal of
the Court of Appeals' opnlon.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Balme.

Mr* Perskie.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAR-JIN D. PERSKIE, ESQ.
HR. PERSKIE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I think initially I should point out the procedural
context in which this case comes before the Court.
I-

In the Federal District Court, the New Jersey
Supreme Court and the Attorney General and the Deputy
Attorney General, whom I'll labeX M the DsfeRdant0j were

19
successful In making a motion under federal rule 12(b)(6)
and obtained a dismissal of a complaint for failure to
state a cause for which relief could be granted and also
at the same time were able to block the application for
preliminary restraint.
With this juncture, the procedure, the

Plaintiff

is entitled —- the Plaintiff Judge Helfant is entitled to
have all the facts that he has established regarded as
true together with the reasonable inferences that flow
therefrom.
Now, the Defendants in this case had not answered
the complaint.

They had not filed an affidavit.

They have

not introduced one iota of testimony before the federal
court and their defense in this case is essentially
ingenious argument which is not based on the record and
dealing with the record, we contend that the facts that
have been established in that record meet the requisites
of equity intervention in a pending state criminal proceed­
ing, that there is a reputable damage that is great and
immediate, that this case falls within the extraordinary
circumstances doctrine of Younger vs. Harris, the unusual
circumstances doctrine of Staffel versus Thompson, the
extremely rare case referred to by Chief Justice Burger in
his concurring opinion in Allee versus Medrano and that it
meets the bad faith and harassment requirements so that

20
right across the board, the Plaintiff is entitled to
injunctive relief in this pending state criminal proceeding.
Now, the facts, as 1 heard them from my opponent,
are not the facts — the complete facts that are in the
record.
Initially to start with, when the Plaintiff was
called before the State Grand Jury, he not only refused to
go before the State Grand Jury, but he had a hearing before
a trial court which ordered him to appear before the State
Grand Jury.
He then attempted to 'appeal arid, over the telephone,
actually appealed this decision to the Appellate Division,
which is' the immediate appeals tribunal in the State of New
r

'

‘

.

r

Jersey. ' He was unsuccessful in that joint telephone call
with the Attorney General and he attempted to contact the
m.

Supremo Court and he was* unable to do so and he finally had
'

’!

to go before the Grand Jury.

‘if

\

In other words, he did everything humanly possible
to resort to his Fifth Amendment privilege and to keep from,
l

•y‘‘

testifying.
QUESTION;

But I understand that they told him he

could go before the Grand Jury and plead the Fifth Amendment.
.

•

MR. PERSKIE:

•« -it

He did and he went before the Grand

Jury — '
QUESTION;

Is all of this, he just objected to

21
going in the door?
MR. PERSKIE:

He objected to testifying before

the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

To going In the room.

MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And he went all the way up to the

Supreme Court to find out whether he had to go in the
room or not.
MR, PERSKIE:

Yes, and he found out he had to go

in the room, Mr. Justice and —
QUESTION:

But he could, once he got there, have

refused to say a single word, could he not, except to claim
the Fifth Amendment.
MR. PERSKIE:
did, Mr. Chief Justice.

Yes, and that is exactly what he
Ke resorted completely to his

privilege on that occasion and he was again subpoenaed to
reappear before this Grand Jury and there is in the record
a letter .from one of his counsel to cocounsel Indicating
that his intention was still to resort to the Fifth
Amendment.
Now, we must watch the time context here because
I think this is Important.
In the late afternoon about 3‘*30 of November the
6th — and our court system closes at 4:00 o’clock in the
afternoon —• he received a call from the administrative

22

director of the courts*
The next day, and I think the Court can take
judicial notice and I think it is in the brief as an election
day that all the official activities in the State of New
Jersey were closed down — so at 3?30, on November the 6th,
he was impelled to appear before the Supreme Court in private
session.
He says "Why?
answer was given.

Why are

you calling me?"

And no

He was just told to be there.

A call V7&3 not made to counsel.

The call was made

directly" to the Plaintiff In this case.
He then appeared at 10 minutes of 10': 00 before the
Supreme ‘Court and now, after a great deal of exchanging of
briefs, the state has finally admitted that not only did the
S Supreme Court question the Plaintiff, but it had before it the

raw Grand Jury testimony, the actual testimony’ of an incomplete
;

f

criminal investigation,

in violation of their own rules 'which calls for the 3ecrecy
of Grand Jury proceedings.
QUESTION:

• i

When you say appeared before the Court,

the fact is he appeared before the members of the Court in a
private room.
MR. PERSKIE:

That is correct, your Honor, in their

private chamber and there is one other thing that I should

23

state at this time and I have heard it where the Attorney
General was arguing this case with me.
Seated in that private chamber at that

time were

two judges of the Appellate Division which again points out
the power and the integratability of the New Jersey court
system.
There was a Judge Comford who was a member of the
Appellate Division who was actually temporarily assigned
to the Supreme Court and Justice Sullivan who had not yet
been elevated to the Supreme Coufir'who was also a member of
the Appellate Division and they were filling in for other
justices who were either — had resigned or were absent so
that there were two judges of the intermediate appeals
court sitting in that room when the Plaintiff entered the
room.
QUESTION:

They were filling in, not specifically

for the purposes of this interview but were generally there
from the ~~
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes, sir, they Were there in

connection with their regular duties.
QUESTION:

To be members of the Court for the

'‘Court’s regular duties.
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes, sir.

Yes, your Honor and I

apologise for that not being in the brief.

With all the

briefing we did, that should have been in there.

24
QUESTI011:

So how many, judges or temporary judges

of the Supreme Court were in the room when —
MR. PERSKIE:

They were one short.

I believe there was one that liras missing.

There were six.

Judge Proctor was

not actually In at that time.
QUESTION:

Pine.

This was about 10:00 o'clock In

the morning on the —
MR. PERSKIE:
10:00.

♦

He got there about 10 minutes to

QUESTION:

The day after Election Day.

MR. PERSKIE:

The meeting before the,Grand Jury

was at 10:00 o'clock and when h© said to the Administrative
Director xirho called him,"I have to be before the State Grand
Jury at ‘10:00 o'clock,”

he

said, "We know all about it.”

So for this statutory, for this constitutional,
mandated inquiry that my opponent speaks'of that allow themselves 10 minutes, 10 minutes of time and they had the raw
Grand Jury testimony before them.
QUESTION:
Stewart wa3.

I ain still confused, as I think Justice

What day was this?

Was this Election Day or

the following?
MR. PERSKIE:
was Wednesday.

No, this was the day following.

This

He appeared before the State Grand Jury and

nothing was done on Election Day, which was a Tuesday.
appeared before them 10 minutes of 10:00 on a Wednesday.

He

25

And then the questioning started and the

ques­

tioning was not directed to whether you Intend to resign,
whether you are fit to hold your Job as a judge — and he
did not offer his resignation at this meeting.

That was

done at some subsequent time.
The questioning was as to his philosophy on the
Fifth Amendment, whether he believed the judge should resort
to the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, does that strike you as an

unreasonable inquiry under these circumstances on the part
of the Justices of the Supreme Court of New Jersey?
MR. PERSKIE:

It certainly does, your Honor,

particularly 10 minutes before the time he is to go into
a Grand Jury where he has already resorted to the Fifth
Amendment.
QUESTION:

You say that a Chief Justice of the

Supreme Court of New Jersey charged with disciplinary and
administrative responsibilities for an entire court system
can’t ask a judge who has claimed the Fifth Amendment

his judicial role?

There is a time and place for that

Inquiry to be made and It certainly In my opinion is not
10 minutes before you are about to go before a Grand Jury
whereyou are accompanied by counsel and where there are
rules.

26
There is a Due Process established where the
disciplining of counts, which calls for notice, which calls
for a hearings which calls for representation by counsel and
to get a man who is about to go before a State Grand Jury
who knows — and this is another important factor — who
knows the makeup of the Grand Jury and the fact that three
convicts have been brought by the Attorney General before
that Grand Jury with promises of leniency who have testified
against him, who are aware of this testimony — and with all
this on his back, to be called 10 minutes before he is to
enter into that pit by the Supreme Court without the
presence of counsel, without any notice of why he is being
there, it was not the time and place to do it.
Now, there is a time and place to do it and the
Supreme Court certainly has the power with the — one of the
points of our brief is that we have —
QUESTION:

That doesn’t agree with what you said.

You said he said what the witnesses had testified to before
the Grand Jury?
MR. PERSKIE:

He knew what three of them had.

They

were convicts,
QUESTION:

I thought you said a minute ago that the

Supreme Court should not have known what went on in the
Grand Jury?
MR. PERSKIE:

They should not have.

They should

not have.
QUESTION:

Via 11, then, why should he know If the

Supreme Court shouldn't know?
MR, PERSKIE:

Well, he was told by a representa­

tive of the New Jersey State Police.

That Is t*hat appears

that he shouldn't have been told, but he was and that is
part of the —
QUESTION:

Well, evidently the Grand Jury Minutes

of New Jersey aren't so secret.
MR, PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

Well, that's —

If soneone is just walking around

talking about it.
»

MR. PERSKIE:

Well, that is one of the points
’

r

we are making here, that there was a complete collapse of
dur process, that the Attorney General should have never
turned those Grand Jury minutes over to the Chief Justice
and, what is more, he should have never told his detectives
what ’was going on in that Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

The state trooper should not have told.

MR. PERSKIE:

Mo, the Attorney General who was

conducting the investigation, Mr. Justice, was absolutely
the source of the —
QUESTION:

The state trooper shouldn’t have told

your client, either.
MR. PERSKIE:

He certainly shouldn’t have.

He

certainly shouldn't have.
QUESTION:

Did I misunderstand you — I thought I

heard you say that his attorney x^ould be with him before the
Grand Jury,

Is that true in

MR, PERSKIE:

In New Jersey you are not allowed to

bring your attorney into a Grand Jury.

You can have him

standing outside and you can consult with him.
QUESTION:

That Is, in general, the traditional

patter.
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes,

him before the Supreme Court.

But there was no attorney with
The attorneys were not

invited.
QUESTION:

Well, when you suggested that he did not

know why he was being called to the conference tilth the
members of the Supreme Court, do your pleadings allege that
he did not know?
MR. PERSKIE:

Absolutely, absolutely.

It is in the

verified complaint.
QUESTION:

Is that a credible allegation?

MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

Well, he asked —

That as a judge, he did not know what he

was being called there for?
MR. PERSKIE:

Well, in view of what happened, I

think it is a very credible situation because they did not
do what you would think they would do; say look, for the

29

benefit of the court system, step a3ide while this is going
on.

But that isn’t what they did.

They just tried to

frighten him out of resorting to the Fifth Amendment.
In fact, the very last words, when he left the
chambers, Mr. Justice Weintraub inquired, "What do you
intend to do today?'5

And he said, "I am going to testify."

And when he got outside the Grand Jury chambers,
he was met by counsel and his counsel said, ’’You must
resort to the Fifth Amendment."
It is my ticket

He says, "I can’t do it.

quote "It’s my ticket," which was his

right to practice lav;.

He was so frightened, he was afraid

he vras going to be disbarred if he didn’t resort to the —
if he resorted to the Fifth Amendment and there is another
very important factor here.
There was a codefendant, Samuel Moore, itfho has
since died.

He was called before the Supreme Court at the

same time.
If you recall his affidavit, he had appeared
before the Grand Jury twice.

They made him wait four hours

each time and after each session they asked him if he
could deliver

Helfant, whether he could deliver any

information on HeIfant and he says, "You want me to lie?”
and they said, "Ho, just tell the truth."
Well, he was called before the Supreme Court and
he was asked to bring the criminal complaint, which is the

30
gravamen of the substantiva charge against him.
He was charged with unlawfully compounding a felony,
obtaining the dismissal of a

criminal complaint.

That com­

plaint was spread on the table before the members of the
Supreme Court and they discussed the genuineness of the
Plaintiff’3 signature on that complaint.

And that was one of

the central questions in the criminal charge
that he, in effect, signed the dismissal

against him,

of that complaint

and he was asked — they discussed this, "Is this your
signature?"
And the Chief Justice turned to Mr. Moore and asked
him if he

called the state trooper who had been releasing

this Information on obscenity and he said that he had.
He was also asked as to the reliability of certain
lav? firms.
Well, this just was not a — this was a hodgepodge
affair.

It wasn't a real inquiry Into the merits.
QUESTION;

These facts are covered in affidavits,

are they?
MR, PERSKIE:

Yes, sir, that is the affidavit of

Samuel Moore that Is in the Appendix and I might say that
the only affidavits in this case are ours and every fact
that I have alluded to is In the Appendix and is supported
by Affidavit.
QUESTION;

Well, Is your fundamental claim that he

31
was coerced into testifying and waiving his Fifth Amend­
ment rights?
MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Well, now, he said that -- in his

affidavit, I cannot say that the Supreme Court in any way
directed me to testify nor did they in way indicate to me
what the consequences would be if I continued to stand by
the Fifth Amendment.
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes, but they are — the very next

sentence —
QUESTION:

'Well, now, where ^>Id the coercion

come from?
MR. PERSKIE:

Well, if you will follow that

through, the very next sentence is, "But I was under the
impression that if I didn’t, something would be done to me."
That is —
QUESTION:

Well, that was his impression, yes.

MR. PERSKIE:
at the facts.

Yes.

Well, the facts — let's look

He was beyond reach.

I just couldn't

He was emotionally

shattered.,r
QUESTION:

Another question, is coercion -— is

coerced testimony a defense to a false swearing count?
MR. PERSKIE:

This again, I certainly think it Is

and using the cases that tirere cited by my opponent, United
States versus Knox —
QUESTION:

Is it in New Jersey?

MR. PERSKIE:

In New Jersey that question is not

completely resolved.
QUESTION:

Well, it isn’t in the federal system,

is it?
MR. PERSKIE:

I believe it is because In the case

of the United States versus Knox, there is the language
that durefss Is a traditional defense to a criminal act and
in every case cited by my opponent where he attempted to
distinguish false swearing from the substantive charges,
there had been a conviction of perjury or there had been
testimony given in a proceeding ifhich was then valid and
legal.
It is our contention that this proceeding was

33
tainted and that there is a defense of duress and that that
defense would have to be raised in the state courts as a
defense for the criminal charge.
Nov;, if the remedy is tainted, if the remedy is
perverted, and this is the whole meaning of justice because
if the extraordinary circumstances docket means anything, it
means an intact state remedy where you can vindicate a
constitutional right.
Now, if that remedy is tainted, Mr. Justice, it is
just as tainted for the perjury charge or the false swearing
charge as it is for the false substance of the facts.
QUESTION:

Well, now, why shouldn't you have to

present any defense as you have in the state criminal prose­
cution?
MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

Because —

Including any federal constitutional

claims.
MR. PERSKIE;

Because traditionally — and I cite

the case of the United States versus McCord and there are
other cases that v?here there is prosecutorial misconduct,
the remedy is not to go through the trial but a dismissal
of the indictment and where there is judicial misconduct —
and, after all, the standard of conduct of a Supreme Court
Is the most —
QUESTION:

Well, that Isn't the court that would try

your client?
MR. PERSKXE:
integrated system.
QUESTION:

Well, the New Jersey system Is

an

There is absolute power.
Well, that may be but the Supreme

Court wouldn't be trying your client.
MR. PERSKXE:

No, but the rights of appeal would

go through the Supreme Court and there are Judges of the
Appellate Division as to whom he would have an appeal of
right who have already sat on this matter that were in this
conference, the two judges that vie referred to.

One of

them is still — Judge Comfert is still on the Appellate
Division.
QUESTION:

Are there not other judges that could

be substituted if he took that route?
MR. PERSKIE:

Your Honor, we could go over a full

resurrection or remanufacture the court system in the
State of New Jersey ~
QUESTION:

Well, I’d like an answer to that

question.
MR. PERSKIE:

The answer I don’t think — the

answer I think is no because like in the conflict of
interest cases
QUESTION:

You meant that no other judge would be

available to sit in place by special designation?
MR. PERSKIE:

There would be many judges who

35
would be able to be replaced by the Chief Justice- to sit
but whether that in any way changes his remedy or the
adequacy of his remedy, I don’t think it would and I say
because of this, if there was a municipal council or a
zoning board of adjustment where there is one man that has
a conflict of interest, that taints the action of that
entire board and I say that as long as there are any judges
or ever x? all the judges have gone, the impact and
influence of *?hafc the Supreme Court did will trickle down
on all the trial courts and —
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying then that they

can't ever try him in the State of New Jersey?
MR. PERSKIE:

Absolutely, sir.

I don't think it

is possible for this man to get a fair trial in the State
of New Jersey.

Now, if he were converted into a modern-day

Diogenes and went from one end of the state to another to
look for a court that would give him a fair trial, with a
computer it is possible that he could find one.
But that isn’t the Way it work's.
this case was laid in Mercer County.

So then you —

The judge would be

selected or can be selected by the assignment judge of
Mercer County who, in turn, is selected by the chief justice.
The Plaintiff will have absolutely no way of
determining

who sits in his case,

QUESTION:

You mean, by the new chief justice, who

36
is former Governor Hughes, now, isn't he?
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes,

Yes, the chief justice is

gone but the influence will linger.
QUESTION:

Well, apparently about everyone who

participated in that conference except Judge Sullivan has
gone, hasn’t he?
MR. PERSKIE:
there.

Well, Justice Sullivan Is still

Justice Mountain is still there.

Judge Confort is

still sitting on the Appellate Division.
QUESTION:

And all of them, under New Jersey

■jj

system, can be replaced by other judges?
MR. PERSKIE:

They can be replaced and I don't

think due process contemplates that if you search the four
corners of the state you can finally find somebody that can
hear it.

I think that the system is essentially tainted

and perverted and that there will be no adequate remedy —»
QUESTION:

You mean, if the whole Supreme Court

in New Jersey changes, you still couldn’t try him?
MR. PERSKIE:

No, sir, because I think that what

happened —
QUESTION:

Now, what theory do you possibly

have that under?
MR. PERSKIE:

Because, again, as the influence

lingers, the personnel may change but this Is an action
done by the court and you are asking a trial judge —

37
QUESTION:

Did you say it was done by the court?

I thought It was done in a private room.
MR. PERSKIE:

It was

done by the court in a

private room.
QUESTION:

Is there any record of it?

MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

There is no record of it.

Well, then, it is not court action.

It is done by individual people.
MR. PERSKIE:
QUESTION:

It is done by —

And those individual people are gone

but the memory .lingers on.
MR. PERSKIE:

That Is correct.

That is correct,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

And the memory Is good enough so that

New Jersey can never try this man, this one man.

Is there

anybody else In the world In that fine position that he
can't be tried?
MR. PERSKIE:
witn all due candor.

Well, I am not concerned with them,
I am concerned with this Plaintiff

and I might say this, we have had a bite of the apple.
We have made application for leave to appeal to
the Appellate Division on these very facts.

It has been

rejected.
We have made application for leave to appeal and
for a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the

33
State of New Jersey to allow a review of this action and it
has been rejected and it has been rejected over the signa­
ture of Chief Justice Weintraub who is the man that we say
is responsible for this meeting that was participated in by
all members of the Supreme Court so to the extent possible
we tried to exhaust our administrative remedies.
We went all the way up to the Supreme Court and
they wouldn’t even countenance an inquiry into this matter.
Now, I say this.

I certainly feel that we should

be allowed to build a full record before the Federal
District Court to determine whether this is an extraor­
dinary situation, whether there is adequacy of remedy,
whether there is irreparable harm because to say that a new
court can be substituted — the harm has been done.
harm has been done.

The

He ha3 been deprived and coerced out

of a constitutional right with certain consequences.
Now to say, now you can give him a free trial
after you have broken his back, you have taken away a
substantial constitutional right, now you are going to give
him a fair trial after you've crippled him, I don’t think
that that gives a man a fair trial.
Once you have turned your lethal 'weapons on him
and to say you are going to treat him nice afterwards is
not an answer to a deprivation of the constitutional right.
It has already occurred.

It has happened and I

39
don’t think it can be undone and it certainly cannot be
undone in the State of New Jersey.
I feel also that the Circuit Court which remanded
this case solely to have a declaratory judgment on the issue
of coercion is too limited an approach.
QUESTION:

And they meanwhile enjoined the

prosecution by the state?
MR. PERSKIE:

Yes.

But what they are in effect

saying is, to the Federal District Court, you give a
declaratory judgment on the issue of coercion.

After you

have determined whether or not there is coercion, then the
Supreme Court will be reliever of that embarrassment and we
can then' send this case back to the New Jersey court system
to complete the criminal

proceedings ahd I don’t

think a

piecemeal approach — and there are other issues In this
case besides coercion — there are issues of bad faith.
is"-

>{

,

■■4kJ,

There are issues of whether or not this is an
extraordinary case, an extremely rare case.

There are

Issues of —■ and I don’t think the section we are concerned
with, if this Court please, is an extremely narrow one.
We don’t have to be concerned about the precedential
aspect of it.

Our research has failed to disclose 'where

anything like this has ever happened before and certainly
if this Court acts with vigor and acts the way we
respectfully ask it to act, it will never happen again and

40

that the rights of litigants in state criminal courts will
be beyond reproach not only by errant prosecutors, not
only by overzealous law enforcement officers but by Supreme
Court judges who can also err.
And I might say this, that if I seem too brash,
I would like to say this, that my father was a member of
this Court and my brother was a member of the court system
of the State of New Jersey and it has been reluctantly and
slowly I have come to the conclusions I have come to.
I liras brought up to respect and revere the
court syst/m of the State of New Jersey.
In this instance, I have had to allow my better
judgment to overcome my amotion and I have been involved in
this case and I know by the feel that this man will not —
will never get a fair trial in the State of New Jersey.
I am the one who has made these actions before
the

trial court, before the Appellate Division, before the

Supreme Court.

We have attempted to exhaust the remedies

there and I think that this is a traditional case and that
there can be no distinguishmenc between the false swearing
and the substantive charges because we are right back
again to the remedy and just as a for instance, one of the
false swearing charges was whether he signed the dismissal.
Now, the Supreme Court has already examined that
complaint.

They have had a rump session.

They have had an

41
evidential hearing as to whether or not his signature was
genuine.
QUESTION:

But isn’t it pretty clear that that

body of men is not ever going to hear any appeal on this —•
on your client through the New Jersey state system?
Isn’t that clear?

That there will be substitute

judges.
MR. PERSKIE:

I don’t know.

There haven’t been

substitute judges in the application we made for temporary
[inaudible] appeal.
QUESTION:

Does not the system provide

for that

process?
*

MR. PERSKIE:

It provides for it but it did not
■

occur up until now.
QUESTION:

.

...

>

As I said, we have made two appeals.
You have taken a number of steps that

have retarded the state proceedingss have you not?

And

quite successfully.
MR. PERSKIE:

Nell, the — all the retardation of
’’

v.;-

the criminal proceedings has been caused by the state since
we have gotten the first effective order in our behalf
the Circuit Court of Appeals.

in

AH the petitions for recall

of mandate, for certiorari, were initiated by the "tats of
'V '

Nex-? Jersey but they have allowed the evidential hearing

to

go through that was originally scheduled over a year ago *~
this matter has now been resolved and they are the ones that

42

have taken the appeal.
lb depends whose ox Is being gored.

When we are

losing., they appeal and when they are losing, we are
appealing and this is the nature of the beast.
But what is important is that there be a limita­
tion of a substantial constitutional right in the state
court and up to now we have not been able to vindicate that
right.

We have not even been able to gain a hearing, not

even an inquiry.

The courts have even refused to give us

an inquiry and if this is not extraordinary circumstances,
as the Circuit Court of Appeals has stated, it is hard to
conceive where there would be an extraordinary situation or
an extremely rare case.

This is it and it is because it

involves the coalescing, the working together of two of the
highest branches of government, the Supreme Court of the
. ;

. : - ..si

State and the Attorney General's office to deprive, coerce
and duress and illegally take away from a man "a valid
constitutional right.
Tills has never happened anywhere else and I say
again, if we are successful here, I am sure it will never
happen anywhere again.
But it has happened and to say that xtfe can replace
everybody in the

court system is like replacing all the

blood in your body and once you have a disease, just
putting in new blood doesn’t cure the disease when the harm

has already been done.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Baime, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVIS S. BAIME, ESQ.
MR. BAIME:

I'd like to answer at least one

question that tras propounded.
In the State of New Jersey, th® Stats Supreme Court
in State against Falco,

specifically has held that a coer­

cion defense is not available with respect to the charge of
false

swearing.

Specifically I refer the Court to State

against Falco which is cited at page 53 and 56 of my brief.
Secondly, I would just like to reaffirm the
principle tluVifwhat Respondent seeks here is immunity.

He

‘can vindicate his rights if there was a constitutional
violation by an action for damages under the Civil Rights
Act.

'
There are other remedies available as well, as was

pointed out in O'Shea against Littleton specifically.

There

are even criminal penalties which apply where there has been
gross misconduct of a judge or a prosecutor.
Rather, the Respondent here is seeking an
injunction which looks to the future and again we submit that
the prospect of harm occurring or even assuming the truth of
the allegations in the complaint and the inferences we feel

44

cannot be drawn, there is no likelihood of recurrence or
a repeat of this type of situation in the future.
Again we submit that Respondents allegations, as
set forth in the complaint are nothing more than a mere
academic exercise in the conceivable and that the state
should be permitted to try the case, that Respondent s
remedy, assuming conviction, is based on certiorari to this
court or habeas corpus.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:27 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
