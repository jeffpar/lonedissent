PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We might hear argu­

ments first in No., 73-5768, Francisoo against Gathright.
Mr. Kaufman, you may proceed whenever you are
re ady.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DANIEL C. KAUFMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KAUFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case is here on writ

of certiorari to the

United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and
■
two questions are presented for the ■a
Court ts.|||
Consideration,
•
The first is, may a Federal Habea^f Corpus court
decline to consider the merits of an issue "already presented
• -f'

in a direct appeal to a State Supreme -Gourfe^merely because

If®

-ij§
the State Supreme Court in a later case^iiaS^fccepted
the
•
%'f?

same position that was earlier urged upon tlfjfm.
...

'M
Secondly, may a Federal Habe’as' ‘Corpus court
■%$.!'
■

decline to reach a fully .exhausted issu'e nfer&ly because it
■S

■

r t :|i

shares a Habeas Corpus petition with a’n unexhausted issue.
We submit that both these questions should be
. ■

:

V

r

:

ansxv’ered in the negative and that Petitioner should have a
prompt adjudication of both of his Habeas Corpus issues by
a Federal Court.
Q

. ,

Do i read the record correctly that the District

the state court, by whatever name it is known here, the state
court had indicated readiness to grant a new trial?
MR. KAUFMAN:

No, your Honor, not at all.

What had

happened is, in response to the District Court opinion which
devolved upon the state the burden of going .forward, the
Commonwealth had petitioned the Circuit Court of

Fairfax

County to initiate a Habeas Corpus proceeding on Petitioner’s
behalf at which the, presumably, the instruction issue would
be laid before them and that is how that was set in motion
and

other counsel were appointed by the

Fairfax court and

when I received notice of those proceedings, I both moved in
the federal court to stay them and I also, when the federal
court refused to stay those proceedings, appeared in the
state court proceedings and I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you
have focused on one

of the issues the Respondent has raised,

that is, why didn’t I just go back into the state court,
have this issue, the destruction issue adjudicated, and done
with.
I would submit that there are numerous reasons for
not going back, first of which, it is not at all clear that,
although Commonwealth, through the Attorney General would be
satisfied to have the issue adjudicated by the state courts,
it is not at all clear under the state court rule of Hawks
versus Cox, which is cited in our brief, that the state court
would even hear the merits of the instruction issue because

5
the instruction issue was raised on direct appeal and the
writ of error denied and the Hawks doctrice states that,
absent changed circumstances, determination of an issue by
a state or a federal court is conclusive and there is no
indication that the Sharp decision upon which the Common­
wealth relies.is a changed circumstance within the meaning
of the Hawks doctrine.
Secondly —Q

Mr. Kaufman, is Mr.' Francisco
MR. KAUFMAN:

where is he now?

He is still at Bland Correctional

Farm, southwestern Virginia.
Q

Well, if you had gone in, might not the whole

thing have been resolved by.this time and perhaps he would
be out of Jail?
MR. KAUFMAN;

I don't believe so, your Honor, for

the reason that, first of all, it is not at all clear that
the state court would even consider the merits of the

instruction issue, much less rule in our favor on it.
Q

Yes, but if a man’s liberty is at stake, isn't it

worth trying?

And, after all, didn't Judge Millsap indicate

that he would like to have you come back?
MR. KAUFMAN:

He indicated that we could return

if the state did refuse to consider it but I think we have
to look at the totality of the case and there was a search
and seizure issue also presented.

Q

Well, I am just wondering if you aren’t risking

the man’s freedom just for a very nice legal theory?
MR. KAUFMAN:

No, I don't think so at all.

I

think -- I think what happens is, if we were to go back and
if we were to get a favorable ruling from the state court
on the instruction issue, which is by no means clear, we
would still have this unresolved search and seizure issue.
Mr. Francisco probably would be retried.

has certainly not stipulated they will not retry
Absent the —- even without the challenged instruction,

I see no reason why you could not expect that he would be

Yes, but would the state have a right to retry him?

Q

•

''

Assuming that it went through the state court,

could not the district court still have held it?
MR. KAUFMAN:

I’m sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall, I

7
don’t quite understand your question.
Q

If It had gone back in the state court, how would

that have prejudiced the federal court?
MR. KAUFMAN:

Well, as the Court of Appeals below

did, they vacated that part of the decision of the district
courts which ruled on the search and

seizure issue and

said that the federal courts should stay their hands
entirely on that issue until the full gamut of state court
proceeding has rui its course.

I am not talking about that.

Not to the extent that he faced

retrial.

MR. KAUFMAN:

have the state decline to prosecute him further.

I simply

am at a loss to believe that they would let the matter rest
and they have certainly not indicated that they are willing
not to retry him if his conviction is set aside only on
the instruction issue.
Q

And the state court already had rejected your
MR. KAUFMAN:

Q

Exactly, sir.

— search and seizure issue.
MR. KAUFMAN:

Well, there is absolutely no question

at all that the search and seizure issue had been fully
exhausted.

There had been no change in state law whatever.

9
Q

Right.
MR. KAUFMAN:

And the state courts would probably

decline to hear it again even on a retrial.
I think, if you take the Commonwealth’s position
that the chain of events of a direct appeal in a subsequent
state court decision, what you wind up with is more
interference with state court proceedings because you'll
have the federal courts —• any time a new state court
decision comes out, the federal courts will be called upon
to determine whether this new decision is going to affect
Habeas Corpus petitions presently pending before it and If
there is any question that it will or it won't, even though
those issues were presented to the state court in direct
proceedings, the federal court would be constrained or would
be authorized to send it back into the state courts which
have indicated no interest in hearing the question.
Q

Mr. Kaufman, do you read the Sharp case in the

Supreme Court of Virginia as turning on state or federal
constitutional considerations?
MR. KAUFMAN:

Both, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I think it is clear that they relied on their
own line of cases and also in this Court’s decision in
Leary on the federal issue on whether this is an irrational
and hence an unconstitutional presumption.
I think that this Court has indicated in Roberts

10

v. LaVallee, which has been cited in our brief3 that the
mere possibility of successful pursuit of a state remedy that
is open is not sufficient to send the Petitioner back to
exhaust that remedy again when he has exhausted it once
before.
j*Js-

This Court ha3 been fairly clear that repetitious

applications to state court are just not required of a
Habeas Corpus petitioner.

V'"-

■

He is just required to once give

the state courts a fair opportunity to resolve the issue and .

r-.-

Mr. Francisco has given the state court, ih his direct
k

appeal , a fair opportunity to adjudicate the''precise question
which they later adjudicated in Sharp.
Q

MR. KAUFMAN:

It was cited to the/‘district court

Appendix at 43.

Aq., .

:

•,

And the Fourth Circuit,: by' virtue of their
‘

< f

■

abbreviated procedure in Habeas Corpus matters, did not
call for full briefing on this case, but merely sent
Petitioner a letter asking him to informally inform that
court what complaint he had of the district court's decision.
He, in turn, forwarded that letter to me and I
responded in a somewhat informal fashion in light of the
circuit court's request and did not cite any cases in that
letter.

■i

11
Q

Incidentally, was the federal Habeas petition

filed after Sharp was decided or before?
MR. KAUFMAN:

The federal Habeas petition was

formally filed after the Sharp case was decided.

It was

received by the district court accompanied by an application
to proceed In Forma Pauperis two days after Sharp but was —
and was the delay between the receipt by the district court
and the filing that took place because of the district
court's refusal to grant In Forma Pauperis status at that
stage.
However, I think if you look at the petition, you
will see that it was verified by the Petitioner in September
' i

which was prior to the October 3rd decision: tin Sharp.
So it wasn't a case where the Shar$ decision came

down, we said, "There is a great

decision.

'-Ket's run with

t

It in the federal courts.
The petition was fully prepared before the Sharp
ity-ii
;
decision had been;handed down.
■
M

Q

"

But, nevertheless, the decision was made to go

into federal court rather than the state forum?
MR. KAUFMAN:

Frankly, your Honor, "I was not

aware of the existence of the Sharp decision until some two
weeks later when it finally made its way into the informal
legal press and it was not formally, reported in the South­
east Reporter till some months later.

12-13
So at the time the petition was actually sent to
the district court, both I and Petitioner i^ere unaware of the
existence of the Sharp decision.
I think also we have to look, not only to the
instruction issue, which was involved in Sharp, but we have
to look to the search and seizure issue which was, by every­
one's notion, fully and completely exhausted, absolutely
ripe for decision and what the Fourth Circuit did and the
district court did not do was to say, well, the district
court is right in sending you back to the state court to
have your instruction issue adjudicated.
But what the district court should have also done
is stayed its hand on the completely independent search and
seizure issue and not even reached the merits of that issue
and, accordingly, the court of appeals vacated that portion
of the district court opinion which did deal- with the search
and seizure issue and I would submit that that is a wholly
inappropriate way of treating a multiple issue Habeas Corpus
petition.
Q

What if the court of appeals had ruled exactly

the same way the district court had?

It had upheld your

FEderal Constitutional claim on the instruction.

Would it

then have been proper for the court of appeals to say, "We
don't have to pass on the Fourth Amendment claim since your
man is going to'get a new trial anyway"?

14
MR. KAUFMAN:

No, I don’t think that that is the

proper course to take for the basic reason that the search
and seizure issue is, as a matter of practicality, dis­
positive of a retrial.

There is very little point in saying,

if we are going to make a choice on issues and say because
we reach one issue we are not going to reach another,
reaching the instruction issue and not reaching the search
and seizure issue seems to be putting the cart before the
horse because if you say, let’s leave the search and
seizure issue ride for awhile, let’s allow him to be
retried, alloitf him to have another state appeal wherein
that instruction presumably will not be given and then,
some two or three years later, we’ll be in a position to
rule on a search and seizure issue which would have been
dispositive in the first Instance and would have not
required any further proceedings in the state, court of any
character.
Q

•

■

*.<!• /

What if you make both a Miranda claim and a

search and seizure claim in your federal Habeas petition?
Is -it your position that the district court must pass on the
merits of both of them, if exhaustion is present?
MR. KAUFMAN:

Well, I would first say that I

believe that as a matter of judicial economy and the
fundamental nature of the Habeas Corpus writ that a court
should always pass on all issues presented to it and ripe

15
for adjudication because they will, in many instances ,
control a retrial but I think in an individual case you also
have to examine — make an examination of what else is there
besides this particular issue that could come up in a. retrial?
Now, if you had a Miranda issue and search and
seizure issue., for example and if excluding the confession
would not, as a practical matter, preclude a retrial, then
I think you want to reach —

and the search and seizure

would, then I think you want to reach that issue which would,
as a practical matter, preclude a retrial,

because other­

wise, you’ll wind up with a retrial that may,prove fruitless.
What you will also be doing is interfering with
'•a/i'X

the fact-finding process that will ultimately have to be
made on a search and seizure issue or Miranda issue or any
kind of an issue where we have to go outside" of the record
or we could go outside of the record to determine the issue.
.

'-'-k-M

:.ii A.

-'

What you are doing by permitting a'retrial with an
• ■ d- '

issue unresolved is, at best you are delaying it and you may
impair the fact-finding process when a federal district
court is ultimately called upon to decide it.
Q

Conceivably, on a retrial, the state court might

hold a factual hearing, again on the search ’and seizure thing
It might be adequate undex* the 1966 re visions to the Habeas
Corpus act, mightn’t it?
MR. KAUFMAN:

That might well be but It might also

16
be that the state court x^ould say that the prior decision
on the prior motion to suppress is the lav/ of the case.
We are simply in a very murky procedural area and
what we are doing, it seems to me, is going to ensnare a
petitioner on these procedural murkiness areas and sort of
in the hopes that the case will go away, which is what the
Fourth Circuit seemed to say, it might be that this case is
going to be moot one day and we'll never have to rule on
this search and seizure issue and I simply don't believe
that a federal court should speculate as to mootness on
this kind of a record where there is simply no reason to
believe that Francisco would not be tried.
There is simply no reason to believe that he
could not be again convicted by the state, at least of the
lesser included offense o'f simple possession and it is
plain that the search and seizure issue relates altogether
with whether they can convict him of possessing a controlled
substance at all.
The instruction issue merely goes to whether
there is sufficient evidence in state court under proper
instructions for the jury to have found him guilty of
possession with intent to distribute.
I think this interference with the fact-finding
processes is the same kind of concern this Court expressed
in Barker versus Wingc, the speedy trial case, as the

17
reasons for not delaying the trial, the initial trial on
the merits and 1 think the other aspect of prejudice
alluded to by this Court in Barker, that of anxiety, is
still pro;...

in ' .is case.

Petitioner still has no way of knowing what the
ultimate outcome of his Fourth Amendment issue is going to
be.

If this Court says that the courts below are right and

that we should go back into state court., thrash out the
instruction issue, if we win, have a nev; trial, maybe have
them convicted to a more severe sentence, to more time by the
jury and then he can have the Fourth Amendment

issue finally

resolved by the federal courts.
I think, if we also adoot the Commonwealth's
position in that regard, where you have a multiple issue
situation and assuming arguendo that this Court decides the
instruction issue has not been appropriately exhausted in
that the instruction issue really is properly before the
state court, I think what

you wind up with doing is

encouraging petitions for certiorari to this Court because
people who are convicted in state court who have, let’s say,
a federal constitutional claim which they have directly
raised and have fully adjudicated in direct appeal, yet
they have other constitutional, claims which have not been so
adjudicated, would be discouraged from seeking intervention
of the lower federal courts by the Habeas Corpus petition

18
but would instead be encouraged to petition this Court for
review by certiorari on that very issue that wass in fact,
decided by the State Supreme Court and I think that, as this
Court recognised in Pay, a cert petition on direct appeal
is an unnecessarily burdensome step in vindication of
federal constitutional rights where it can be relied upon
that the lower federal courts will be in a position to
hold hearings, if need be, or in a oosition

to adjudicate

these federal constitutional issues.
If the Court has no further questions, I would
reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Kaufman.

Mr. Shepherd.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ROBERT E. SHEPHERD, JR.^ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
■
MR. SHEPHERD:

'
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
■'

please the Court:

' t

li; '

As Mr, Kaufman has pointed out, there are
essentially two issues involved in this casd.

The first

relates to the instructional issue which was based on the
Virginia statute at that time that indicated that a
conviction of possession of drugs could be based solely
upon evidence as to the quantity of

that drug, conviction

of possession with intent to distribute.
An Instruction based on that statute was given

19
in this case in the Circuit Court of .Fairfax County,
I might point out that the objection that was made
at the time of that instruction was — and I quote from
page 129 of the transcript of trial, "We object to
Instruction G, yovr Honor.

We realize that this is merely

a quotation from the statutory language.

However, it is

my opinion that this instruction does not in any way guide
'

‘

,

■

•

■

:

•

•/... / \

the jurors and may tend to confuse them."
Now, this is not in the Appendix, this portion

■ 1i|p

from the transcript.
'

■

Subsequently — in other

Vxt

words, the objection

at that point was on the basis of the possible vagueness of
the instr-’rion

o"

on the basis that the instruction might

tend to confuse the jurors rather than really guide them.
When the petition for appeal was filed in the
Supreme Court of Virginia, the nature of the; issue had
somehow been recharacterized

and it was then based on the —

on sev°^al Federal Constitutional issues including the
validity of the statute upon which the Instruction was
based, on the basis of vagueness and also on the basis of
this Court’s decision in Leary versus United States in that
it was an impermissibly unconstitutional presumption.
So we would submit

that, even initially, there

might be some threshold question of exhaustion as to, in
light of this Court’s decision in Picard versus Connor based

20

on whether the federal constitutional issue was ever
precisely presented to the Virginia courts.
In other words, the Virginia Supreme Court takes
the position that the only issues that will be dealt with
effectively on appeal are issues that were properly and
timely raised at the trial.
Q

Was this a writ of error denied case in the

Supreme Court?
MR. SHEPHERD:

Yes, it was.

Consequently, we deal with that initial 'threshold
question as to whether there was exhaustion despite and in
complete ignorance of the issue based on the Virginia
Supreme Court subsequent decision in Sharp.
However, let’s turn to that aspect of it.

The

Sharp case, as Mr. Kaufman pointed out, the Virginia
decision — the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court in
Sharp was based on state law relative to vagueness in a
statute and it was also based on the Leary decision of
this court.
Q

"State lav/," that is, state constitution?
MR. SHEPHERD:

vagueness.

State constitutional law as to

The court does not specifically delineate where

it is basing its decision on federal constitutional law
and where on state constitutional law but It is clearly
dealing with the Issue in a mixed basis, Mr. Justice

21

Brennan.
Q

On both grounds MR. SHEPHERD:

Yes, sir, your Honor.

The Petitioner — and there is no question about
the fact that the issue on search and seizure was properly
raised and properly characterized, both at the state level
in

the lower courts and in the Supreme Court of Virginia.
A writ of error was denied as to both issues,

which, in the Virginia Supreme Court is considered to be a
ruling on the merits, the order denying a writ of error
states that it is denied for the reason that the judgment
of the court below is plainly right.
The Petitioner then filed his petition for write of
Habeas Corpus in the Federal District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia in Alexandria, raising principally these
two issues.
As Mr. Kaufman has pointed out, the Sharp decision
(
' . ■'«

intervened before the district court dealt with this case
and the district court took the position that the intervening
;-

-M

decision in Sharp necessitated that the Petitioner exhaust
his available state court remedies with regard to the
instructional issue in that this intervening decision did
present a new state of law and the Virginia court quite
possibly and, perhaps, probably, would feel compelled to
grant Petitioner a new trial, based

on the intervening

22
decision

in Sharp versus Commonwealth.
The district court, though, did proceed to deal

with the search and seizure issue, on the merits and ruled
that the issue did not have any validity, that the search and
seizure in this case was indeed proper and that the evidence,
was properly admissible.
The district court took the somewhat unusual
procedural stance that — as to the unexhausted instructional
issue — the burden was on the Respondent, represented by
the Attorney General’s office, to present the issue to the
state courts in some manner for a readjudication of the
Sharp issue.
The Respondent, of course, objected to this
procedure on the basis that the rationale of'28 U^S, Code
section 2254 with regard to its requirement of exhaustion
of available state court remedies places that' burden of
exhausting the state court remedies on the Petitioner but,
nevertheless, and in the absence of any real guidance as to
what procedure

the state could take to initiate a Habeas

Corpus proceedings, the Attorney General's office did
attempt to initiate proceedings

in the Circuit Court of

Fairfax County.
The Circuit Court was likewise at some loss as to
;uhat sort of procedure could be initiated, either by the
court or by the Commonwealth and the decision was made to

23
send Habeas Corpus forms to the Petitioner and advise hoitf
they should be prepared and the Petitioner ignored this
communication and the court subsequently, in spite of this,
appointed counsel for the Petitioner and brought the matter
forward for a hearing.
At that point, Mr. Kaufman, who had been involved
in this case for some time and still has, appeared at the
hearing along with court-appointed counsel and the court
attempted in some detail, to urge the Petitioner to present
the case forward for a hearing to determine whether a new
trial was required and the Petitioner took the position that
he did not want to present the issue to the court.
Now, whatever happens to this case in the future,
I think a substantial issue may have been raised at this
point as to deliberate by-pass.of state procedures insofar
as that instructional issue is concerned.
The Petitioner was certainly given an opportunity.
The court addressed itself both to counsel for the
Petitioner and to Petitioner directly and they were advised,
I think, in terms that would meet the Johnson versus Zerbst
standard as to an intelligent, knowing and voluntary waiver,
they made the decision not to proceed further on the
instructional issue.
Meanwhile, the case was wending its way to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit —

24
Q

Are you going to make this the

law of the case?

What are you going to do when you drag a man in the
courtroom?
MR. SHEPHERD:

You mean, as to the instructional

issue as to whether we would make it the law of the case
that there has been a deliberate by-pass?
Q

Well, you tried to do it.
MR. SHEPHERD:

How could you?

Well, I think the issue would

have —
Q

Mr. Kaufman and the Petitioner didn't come in

there voluntarily, did they?
MR. SHEPHERD:

Well, they didn't come in there

voluntarily in the sense that they did not initiate the
proceedings.
Q

However —

They objected to the proceedings.
MR. SHEPHERD:

Q

They objected to the proceedings.

Why can they be bound by it?
Did they ever submit to the jurisdiction of the

court?
MR. SHEPHERD:

I'm not sure that they technically

submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.
Q

Did they file anything?
MR. SHEPHERD:

Q

They filed nothing.

How do you get jurisdiction over it?
MR. SHEPHERD:

Well, of course, we had that

25

question in the first instance a3 to why —
Q

All I am saying is —
MR. SHEPHERD:

Q

All I am saying isj, is I am as much troubled as

you are.
.

—r why the burden was placed on us.

That is all I am suggesting.
MR. SHEPHERD:

Right.

And, of course, we felt

that that procedure \*as not the appropriate one but never. T.

theless we proceeded on the basis of what we had been
directed to do by the federal district court judge.
It may present — if this case works its way back
down,

it may present an interesting issue at that point as

to whether it would be considered a deliberate bypass.
But when the case came to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, they, of course, agreed
with the district court's disposition of the instructional
issue, feeling that the Petitioner had not properly exhausted
his available state court remedies in light of the inter­
vening decision of the Supreme Court Of Virginia.
But the court, somewhat of i'ts own motion, took
the position that the district court should hot also have
ruled on the search and seizure issue in that the case was
going back to the state court and the disposition of the
instructional issue could, in fact, be dispositive of the
entire case.
Q

You — you are suggesting, or you say there is an

26

argument that could be made that there is a deliberate
bypass of the instructional issue?
MR. SHEPHERD:

That is correct, in the sense that

the Defendant has gone forward and would be precluded by
deliberate bypass from any remedy in the state court.
Q

I think that is a — in which event the court of

appeals clearly would have been wrong not to reach the
Fourth Amendment issue>
MR. SHEPHERD:

Mr. Justice White, I am not com­

pletely sure that is a —
Q

Let's assume there were — let’s assume there

was a deliberate bypass.

That means there would be no

remedy available in the state court.
MR. SHEPHERD:
Q

That is correct.

In which event, the Fourth Amendment issue is

squarely on the table.
MR. SHEPHERD:
Q

"Probably"?
MR. SHEPHERD:

Probably so and of course
It would be, wouldn't it?
That is correct.

Did you make deliberate bypass on the —
MR. SHEPHERD:

Weil, I don’t think that question

— argument ?
MR. SHEPHERD:

— ever squarely before the United

27
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
Are you putting it before us?

■I

MR. SHEPHERD:

No, not really, at this point

because —
Q

I'd think you would'.
MR. SHEPHERD:

— because I think this Court has

to probably deal with the issues as they were before the
Fourth Circuit and I think the question of deliberate bypass
may have to be dealt with in the district court —
Q

In the state court.
MR. SHEPHERD:

In the state courts ultimately.

Initially and perhaps ultimately in federal court again.
Q

Well, if the Defendant is going to face that kind

of an argument from you and the state courts, which
apparently he is, at least it is another argument for having
a ruling in the federal court on the search and seizure
issue.
MR. SHEPHERD:

Well, of course, then we get into

the question of procedural sequence and, you know, it
appears to me that the federal courts would have to deal
•' '■*

with the question of exhaustion, including the deliberate
bypass argument, before they could deal properly with the
search and seizure question.
Q

Well, nobody would ever have to deal with it

unless you raised it, I suppose.

28
MR.

r,IIF,FHERD:

Well, that is correct and I

certainly would not want to waive’ that position at this
point.
n

But nevertheless argue he must go back and face

it.
MR. SHEPHERD:

I think that is right,

I think

he has g,ot to go back and face the question.
Q

But then you can cone back to the federal court

on the search and seizure issue.
MR. SHEPHERD:

It was certainly a procedural

decision that he had to make at the time of that hearing
in the Circuit Court in Fairfax County.

He very easily,

and I think the tone of that hearing indicated, that the
judge of the Circuit Court, the state court , "would have
been inclined to — the question was put to him in the
sense of, if a new trial were ordered, would you cooperate?.
And he said no.

And that they felt that it would be

double jeopardy.
Of course, going back to the Fourth Circuit's
decision on the search and seizure issue, we x^ould take
the position at this point that if the Court wants to deal
with the procedural aspects of the search and seizure
issue, then we feel that that that issue should be addressed
in the context of Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion
in Schneckloth versus Bustamonte as to whether the search

29
and seizure issue itself should, In fact , appropriately be
dealth with on Federal Habeas Corpus without a determination
of the narrow context as to whether Hr. Francisco had been
afforded a fair opportunity to raise the federal constitu­
tional issues and have that Question adjudicated in the
state courts.
Q

What about Roberts against LaVallee?
HR. SHEPHERD:

Mr. Justice Marshall, we feel that

Roberts against LaVallee is perhaps a decision of somewhat
narrower boundaries than this decision.

The issue involved

in Roberts was whether the Petitioner in that case, as an
indigent, was entitled to a free transcript of the pre­
liminary hearing, just as a pecunious defendant would have
been.
This Court dealt with that case on a per curiam
basis.

We submit that the Roberts issue 'ftas, in fact, a

narrow procedural point; the right to a transcript of the
preliminary hearing really was not a substantive issue in
the sense that instructional issue is a substantive issue.
We submit that we are dealing here with a question
that may, in fact, be dispositive of the entire substance
of the case and it is not merely a procedural point as to
whether the person was entitled to. a transcript or something
of —
Q

Well, in this case, if he was entitled to another

30

instruction, he would be retried.
HR. SHEPHERD:
Q

That is correct.

And the same evidence would be used.
MR. SHEPHERD:

That — I — assume,

Mr. Kaufman is correct in that the state court would not
readjudicate the search arid seizure issue after the
Supreme Court of Virginia denied a writ of error.
Q

Well, that’s a lot like Roberts?

Well, the results may be the same.

The court really did not address all of the'issues in

The Court did not deal too broadly with the procedural

They did say though, they had.an opportunity and

did raise the question before the state courts on direct
appeal.

You didn’t have to ro back

in a state collateral

procedure to raise the same thing all over again, see?
'MR. SHEPHERD:
of

I think the problem we have here,

course, is that the resolution of that question was

somewhat dispositive in that case p.rocedurally.
Here we have got an initial issue, for example,
as to whether the instruction could have been harmless
error.

In other words, there would be an opportunity for a

factual' hearing in this case as to whether even the granting
of the instruction was error such a3 to require a new trial.
In other words, this was one of the basic reasons
for the state court having an opportunity to readjudicate
the issues in light of Sharp.
Eor example, in this case, there was affirmative
evidence at the trial, not only of an intent to distribute,
but of an actual distribution of the heroin in this case.
As a consequence, the court could conclude, after
an evidentiary hearing,that the giving of the Sharp
instruction, for want of better terminology — it’s a
shorthand — the giving of the Sharp instruction was, in
fact, harmless error because there was substantial evidence

32

in the record of actual distribution.
Q

Mr. Shepherd, you were -right without argument.

We granted the certiorari and they gave the judgment.
HR. SHEPHERD:
Mr. Justice Marshall.

That was my impression,
Of course, I feel that the Court

Q

You didn't try to get too much out'of that,

MR. SHEPHERD:
Q

Sir?

You don't try to get too much out of that,

do you?
MR. SHEPHERD:

I don't try,and get an awful lot

out of it.
Q

There was an, opinion and a dissident opinion.
• MR.- SHEPHERD:

Although I think the Court — I

think the Court has been incline^ in the last few years to
deal with some of the procedural aspects of Federal Habeas
Corpus in a good deal more detail than it had during the
period in which the Roberts case was decided. ■
Q

That is your opinion.
MR. SHEPHERD:

Q

Which you are entitled to.
MR. SHEPHERD:

Q

That is my opinion, yes.

That is true.

. Your Honors, we submit that the decision of the

United States Court of "Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in

this case is plainly correct, that the court was proper in
saying that the issue of search and seizure should not be
decided by the state courts in light of the disposition that
was being made of the Sharp instructional issue.

MR. SHEPHERD:

Well, certainly, the

than the instructional issue, isn't it?

Is it apparent from either the district court

simply would not have tried the man again had the search

. MR. SHEPHERD:

I don't think either -of the courts

expressed any view on that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and. It
is really hard, for me to even say at this point what other
available evidence there might be, because it is the local
Commonwealth Attorney that actually tries the cases and we
merely handle the Appellate and collateral proceedings.
Q

Do you know of the number of dope cases in Virginia

where there was a. conviction without any dope being used?
I've never heard of‘one. '
MR. SHEPHERD:

I think it would — I think it would

be very, very difficult.

But, conceivably, in this case,

they might have proceeded purely on the testimony of the
informer.

As to whether he was able to express the fact

that it was really heroin.
Q

But more to the point, as I understand what your

point is, the the Fourth Circuit could have passed on both
points but they didn't have to pass on both.

Is that really

36
.your point?
MR. SHEPHERD:

I think that —
K

\

Q

You- admit that they could have passed on both?
MR. SHEPHERD:

I think they probably could have

passed on both.
But they didn’t?
MR. SHEPHERD:

And, in fact, in the past, as

counsel for the Petitioner has pointed out, they have done
so, in Hewitt versus North CArollna, they dealt with an
unexhausted issue, and exhausted issues and they dealt with
the merits of both issues.

But I don’t think that their

refusal to do so amounts to such an abuse of their
discretion as' to constitute reversible error in this
Court.
I think that it is a matter that should be left
with the courts in the exercise of their discretion.
Q

Mr. Shepherd, you have sought to bring up a couple

of times the larger question, or the larger position, the
larger claim, that a

search and seizure claim is simply

unavailable on Federal Habeas Corpus.

And* as to whether it is properly

as to whether the substance of the issue is even before the
Court, we are dealing more with the procedural niceties
surrounding the substantive issues without dealing with the
substantive issues directly.
Q

Well, of course, if you are *—■ if the claim is

here, if you should prevail on that claim, then, clearly,
the Court of Appeals was right in saying —• in not reaching
the claim because, if you are correct, they couldn’t reach
the- claim.

They wouldn’t have the power, if you will.
MR. SHEPHERD:

That would be correct.-

MR. SHEPHERD:

No, Schneekloth is —

MR. SHEPHERD:

And you haven’t briefed it, have you?

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL C. KAUFMAII, ESQ.
ON BEHALF. OF THE PETITIONER

HR. KAUFMAN:

First, on the objection in state

court, I would freely concede that inexperienced trial
counsel, namely me, In the heat of a hotly-contested trial,
just overlooked that grounds for objecting to that
Instruction, for I point out to the Court that the
constitutionality of that instruction is plainly and
unmistakeably raised in the petition for writ of error,
as demonstrated on pages 31 and 32 of the Appendix.
The C-omm'onuealth, in responding to that petition,
the extract there is at page 3T of the Appendix, addressed
the merits of it.

There was no question at that time of

any proceudral default in raising the constitutionality of
that instruction. It neither the district court nor the court
of appeals level has the Commonwealth asserted procedural
default in raising that Issue.

39
Q

Do you. agree with Hr. Shepherd, Mr. Kaufman„

that the practice of the Supreme Court of Virginia is not to
pass on an issue such as that.if it wasn't raised any
differently than you raised it,in the
MR, KAUFMAN:

circuit court?

Mr. Justice Relinquist, I'm not that

familiar with the practice of the Virginia Supreme Court
to b.e aware of the rationale for their decision, but, as
Mr. §hepherd pointed, out,.it was a decision, it had the

effect of a decision on the merits.
Q

But certainly not on the merits of a claim that

prior decisions the court xvould hold couldn’t properly be
raised in the absence of a suitable, objection.
. MR, KAUFMAN:

I would tend to agree that that

would certainly be an open question, had the commonwealth,
in opposing the.petition, called the Court's attention to
some defect in the objection, but they did noth
right to the merits of the instruction itself.

They went
There v:as

no question raised at- that point as to any procedural
default and I would, in' that regard, direct the Court’s
attention to a recently reported decision of an en banc
panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit•in Harris versus Nuperior Court, which appears at
500 P. 2nd 11/2-4 where the court there said,' "a state court
decision which , could have been procedurally founded will
not be presumed to be procedurally founded in a Habeas

40

Corpus case unless the state court, in its decision,
expressly states that it is declining to reach the issue
of the claim on a per procedural matter.
Also, on Hr. Shenherd — would have us send this
hack to the state courts because there is something differ­
ent about the way the state court and the state Habeas
Corpus proceeding would handle it than t.he federal court
would and he mentioned this concept of harmless error and
I would suggest to the Court that harmless error is always
present in any Habeas Corpus petition, whether it be state
or federal in its present and direct appeals.
I don't see any difference between the kinds of
questions and the ability of a court to consider the

kinds

of questions, whether it is a state court or a federal
court.
And if there are no further questions from the
Bench, I would submit.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Kaufman.
Thank you., Mr. Shepherd,
