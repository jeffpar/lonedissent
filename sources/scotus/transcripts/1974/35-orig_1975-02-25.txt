REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRICE M. CLAG.ETT, ESQ. ,

>

Oil BEHALF OF TIIE DEFENDANTS

MR, CLAGETTs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I have one or two things to say about each of the
Solicitor General’s four arguments.
First, the alleged preclusion by California»
He says, if I understood him correctly, that
California holds only that if a State has no historic title
and the Court must decide, in the absence of such a title,

)

then the federal interest are stronger and would prevail.
He disclaims, as I understood him, any argument
that the federal interests would require overriding an historic
title because the Shelf is a necessary appurtenance of federal
constitutional powers.
This flies in the face, however, of his other
argument that even if the States had an historic title at the
ratification of the Constitution, they then lost it.
They would lose it, surely, only if it was necessary
for the federal government to have it, to protect its
constitutional interests.

And if it is thus necessary,

how can Congress give it away?

89

The Solicitor General, X submit, cannot have it both
ways*

If Congress was free to give part of the Shelf to the

States in 1953, then Shelf ownership is not necessary to
federal powers, as he admits.

And since it is not necessary,

then the Constitution would not have taken an historic State
title away.
QUESTION!

In your view, then, it is not within

the power of the sovereign to decide in what particular
instances it might be necessary and in other instances that it
could be yielded in part?

That -that is not within the broad

sovereign power?
MRa CLAGETTi

Not in the event of an antecedent

historic title, Mr. Chief Justice.
It seems to me -that a title to property which was
vested in a State before and at -the time of the Revolution
could only be taken if there was some constitutional
necessity for taking it.
QUESTIONS But Congress, in passing that Act, assumed
and of course acted on the assumption that it had -die title,
did it not?
MR. CLAGETT:

Yes, Your Honor, and thatfs precisely

why the Act has to be unconstitutional if Congress was wrong
on that point. There’s no dispute here, as I understand it,
that if the States did have a vested title in property, then
■the Outer Continental Shelf Act is unconstitutional,,

90

I take it the

plaintiff concedes that.

I might add that the Congress did its best to
restore to the States ail the title which it was then aware
that the States had.

Probably because no valuable resources,

as of that time, had been discovered in the Atlantic Ocean,
nobody has done his homework, and nobody knew what the history
was, and the States were not then articulating their claim
very well.
So Congress passed that Act under a misapprehension„
It intended to, and it thought it was restoring to the States
all the title they had.
QUESTION:

No, which Act, the Outer Continental

Shelf Act?
MR. CLAGETTs
QUESTION?

Both acts taken together?

MR. CLAGETTs
QUESTION:

Both Acts taken together, would —»

Yes.

Right.

MR. CLAGETTs

I would add that there is no need for

you to overrule the holding of California, in order to decide
for the States here.

That holding, of course, was that

California did not own the three-mile belt.
If you hold in our favor on the basis of an historic
title, then that holding would not apply to any State which,
like California, lacks such a title.
To be sure, California and other States might renew

91
their claim that the equal footing doctrine would require them
to have 'die same amount of shelf as the Atlantic States,,
But the Court could well hold, as it did in Alabama
vs - Texas, quite clearly, that the equal footing doctrine
requires nothing of the kind,.

It does not require that every

State own an equal amount of Continental Shelf, any more than,
it requires that ©very State have as large a land territory
as the State of Texas or the State of AlaskaF
I think I failed to make myself altogether clear
yesterday as tc the circumstances in which, if the Court, should
decide

in our favor, federal intervention in the Shelf would

require compensation to the States, and the circumstances in
which it would not.
There are, as I see it, three possible situationss
One, the federal government takes oil or other Shelf
resources owned by the States for its own use? that plainly
would be a taking and would require compensation,.
Two, the federal government, by treaty, agrees with
other nations that the Continental Shelf under exclusive
American ownership is not as large as it is now considered to
be, thereby cutting off State ownership as to some parts of
it.

That would be a federal Act adjusting boundaries or

settling international law in the exercise of the foreign
affairs power, it would not, in my submission, be a taking
and it would not require compensatione

I might add that that question is wholly academic,
at least as to the foreseeable future, because the whole
tendency in international law and policy at the moment is to
expand the Continental Shelf rights, not to cut them back.
Three, the federal government in the interest, either
of national defense or for economic reasons, tells the. States
that they must develop Shelf resources faster or differently
from what they are doing»

The States retaining ownership and

still receiving the revenues»
That would not be a taking, quite clearly, and would
not require compensation, any more, for example, than federal
resources allocation during World War II did, or any of the
other kinds of paramount powers ‘the federal government
habitually asserts, ©specially in times of national emergency,»
over all the resources of the country.
It would be perfectly proper federal regulation.„
Thus, a decision for the States here will in no way
retard or hamper Continental Shelf exploitation or development
if the national interest is found to require that.
Next, as to the Solicitor General's argument that
the States never acquired any property interest in the Shelf,
it is hard to respond to this because it was stated almost
entirely in conelusory terms, without reasons or facts.
The Solicitor General did make one specific statement, however
He said that the 100-mile

rule was recognised on only two

93

occasions by G@nt.illy and the Earl of Salisbury..
To -file contrary, the lOG-mils rule was declared by,
among ethers# the following eminent British authorities;
William

Welwood, in 1613? Gerard Malynes

in 1632?

Thomas Neal in 1704? Sir Charles Hedges, Admiralty Judge and
Secretary of Stater# in formal legal opinion of 1713? and
Josiah Burchett,secretary of the Admiralty# in 1720*
Further proof is found in the Colonial Charters
themselves# beginning with the Charter of 1606# which created
a hundred-mile territorial sea all up and down the coast of
these very defendant States„
As shown in our Supplemental Brief in detail# in
addition# the overwhelming consensus of Internationa law
authority, throughout the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries#
was in favor of 100-mi La territorial sea,
Finally and perhaps conclusively# 30 leagues# which
is virtually identical to 100 miles# was the boundary asserted
and enforced by Britain throughout -the Seventeenth and
Eighteeenth Centuries for its territorial sea and exclusive
fishing rights in these very waters here under dispute in
North America,
As to Nova Scotia# that boundary was incorporated
into the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.

But Britain regarded the

30-league limit as applicable all up and down the coast of
these States as well.

The proof is our Exhibit 327 in Map

94
Volume III of our Appendix, which is the British copy, the
very British map used in the Peace Negotiations at Paris in

1782-83,
Tha map shows the 30-league boundary drawn all the
way down the coast of these defendant states.
I can only — I have no time to discuss the
Solicitor General's assertions about the Australian and
Canadian cases, I can only say that we submit they are wildly
inaccurate.
I can only beg the Court to study pages 477 through
85 of our Supplemental Brief on that subject.
Next, the Solicitor General contends the federal
government would have succeeded to any Continental Shelf
rights then in existence at Independence, or some time around
there.
I confess, as I heard the Solicitor General wax
eloquent about the sovereignty of the First Continental
Congress, I was wondering why we were not celebrating the
bicentennial this year, instead of waiting for some later,
wholly ancillary, event.
On the point of whether the States were ever fully
sovereign, the key to understanding the events of that period,
we submit, is that the States were

regarded as identical to

the United States, not the United States being a distinct,
separate national government in any sense? it was the United

95
States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, et cetera*

The

term w^s always spelled out in full in that fashion*
Of course the States carried on foreign relations,
not only separately, which they did to a quite considerable
extent, but primarily through their joint representatives,»
Congress was the States*

Congress was made up of Ambassadors

from the States, known as CongressmenEvery Treaty that Congress made was made in the name
of each one of the States, enumerated separately*
The nature of the Confederation was exactly what
the Articles of Confederation, in carefully chosen language,
said it was?

a firm league of friendship*

And it was universally recognised that a federal
league or confederation was a group of several sovereign
States which retained their full individual sovereignty, that
Taiwan Montesquieu, the international lawyer best known to the
Founding Fathers, expressly so stated.
Chief Justice Marshall agreed, as I mentioned
yesterday, in Gibbons vs. Ogden, he declared that the States,
quote, "were sovereign, were completely independent, and were
connected with each other only by a league*"
There’s nothing to the contrary in Penhallow vs.
Doane, which merely holds that Congress had the power to
erect an admiralty court with appellate jurisdiction from the
State prize courts, for the reason that the States, and. in

96

particular New Hampshire, the State which was there contesting
it, had consented to it.

There is not a word in the case of

any inherent federal sovereignty derived from the Crown, or
of any federal powers other than those granted by the States,
QUESTION s

There is something to the contrary in

the Curtiss"Wright opinion,
MR, CLAGKTTs
QUESTIONs

Yes, indeed there is, Your HOnor,

You think that's wrong?

MR, CLAGETT:

Yes, sir.

And of course it purports

to cite Penh allow, but as Julius Goebel said# in his first
volume of the history of this Court, some slightly sloppy
language in Penh allow was then used in Curtiss "Wright to
support "" I've forgotten his exact words? an utterly
inadmissible version of historical events.
Even if the Solicitor General were right about
sovereignty# even if he were right, which he isn't, 'the
historical record and the decisions of this Court show
beyond any question whatever that the United States was never
regarded as acquiring any territory

or property other than

in right of one of the individual States, and nothing was
ceded to the federal government but what was expressly ceded.
The Constitution draws the sharpest possible
distinction between the territory and property of the States,
which remained intact# and the paramount rights of the
federal government 'which were superimposed upon them.

97

The ratification of the Constitution transferred no
territory and no property.
Finally, as to the Solicitor General's claim that
cu?; Continental Shelf rights were destroyed by the three-mile
limit:
Our briefs and the testimony of the trial, particu­
larly that of Judge Jessup, who is the world's leading
authority on the subject, proved beyond a shadow of a doubt
that the Solicitor General's argument is wrong.
The 'three-mile limit applied only to surface waters,
never to the seabed.
As this Court itself said in tins second Louisiana

jn-sattaTV-r—-r—•areae» •.—«

case, maritime boundaries to different, distances are
recognized for different purposes.
The United States never construed the three-mile
limit as cutting off seabed rights. Wholly to the contrary,
in the Bering Sea arbitration, the United States took it as
a fundamental principle that the three-mil® limit had no
application to seabed rights.

And the United States, like

every other nation, asserted.exclusive ownership of seabed
resources beyond three miles, wherever they existed, and
were exploitable, as in the case of the Philippine pearl
fisheries,
QUESTION,-;

How was the three-mile limit established?

MR. CLAGETTs The three-mile limit was first, mentioned

98
by anyone as a boundary for neutrality purposes only# by
Thomas Jefferson in his Letters to the Ambassadors within a
year or two of 1790# 1791.

It was never applied to anything

more than neutrality purposes for some decades thereafter# and
it was never applied to the seabed.
Finally# I must say that we would of course like
the opportunity to respond to whatever the Solicitor General
may say about further proceedings in tills paper he* s going
to file.
We would therefore ask the Court to set a short time
limit for his paper# and one for our response.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you# Mr. Clagett,
When the Solicitor General# and if he files further
proceedings# you will have ten days to respond to it.
Thank you# gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon# at 10:22 o'clock# a.m, # the case in
idie above-entitled matter was submitted.]
