0RAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON H. KE3KIIIB, ESQ.

m BEE.\r.F OF PET I TICK ORB
MR. RIFKXND:

Mr.

Chief Justice and nay it

Please

ti- a Court:
This case comes here on a petition for certiorari
t.o review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit.
; Petitioners have brought this suit to enforce
their copyright claim against the Respondent Aiken who,,
they alleged, had infringed their rights by a public
performance for profit of two songs, one the copyright of
which belonged to each ox the Petitioners respectively.
The district ju«:,e granted the s t a tut cry dr mages
in favor of the Plaintiff below of $250 for each infringe
ment „
The Court of Appeals reversed.

asserted

grounds,for reversal was that Aiken's conduct did net
ameunt to a performance,

though it was public and it was

for profit.
The facts arc simple.

Respondent Aiisr

or cc and

operates •a chain of fast food restaurants in the City of-

4
Pittsburgh.
He decided to entertain his customers and to
improve the efficiency of his employees by furnish
with popular musical performances throughout the business
day.

There were, as 1 believe we can take judicial notice,

available to him several methods by which his purposes
could be accomplished.
One, he could hire one or more musicians to play
such compositions as he or his agenc selected from the
sheet music generally available to the public.
Secondly, he could# if ha chose,- equip
with

' premiers

one or more machines that reproduce music mechani­

cally whan supplied with either records or tapes or pianorolls depending upon the nature of the particular machine
that he decided, to use and these,, too, are generaliy
available for purchase by members of the- public.
Or, he could subscribe to a service like rurar:
which provides musical compositions for use in premises
by machinery equipped for that purpose,,
And, finally, he could, if he wished, equip hia
premises with a radio receiving sot connected to an
electric source of energy, install a sufficient number of
loudspeakers so as to disseminate the sound agreeably
throughout the premises that he wished to servo and cause
the radio receiving set to be oriented by his selection to

any kind of music that ie preferred from among the many
that were being broadcast within the Pittsburgh area by the
several stations doing business there.
Aiken, in fact, chose the last-mentioned method,
I don't think I need to argue the point that it was the
least"costly method.
The district judge, after trial, found that on the
11th of March, 1972, Aiken had caused the customers and
employees in one of his restaurants to be entertained by
two compositions of which the Petitioners were respectively
the copyright owners.
These compositions were received over Aiken’s
radio and were distributed to his restaurant and employment
spaces through five loudspeakers which ha had installed in
the premises.
These two compositions which he so played wore
broadcast that clay by an FM station located in Pittsburgh
snet licensed to broadcast those compositions,

Aiken, how­

ever# had no .license for the public performance for profit
of these compositions and the radio station had no authority
to confer such permission upon Aiken.
QUESTION;

There was no possibility of any implied

license, then, as that was referred to in Jewell-LaSalle„
MR. RIFKIND;
Rehnquist.

That is it precisely, Mr, Justice

The possibility of an applied license had been

6
expressly and explicitly Withdrawn in the license issued by
the copyright owners to this particular station, as to all
stations and that had. been true since 1932.
QUESTION:

I am not sure it is terribly important,

but I could not find in the record the aggregate number of
loudspeaker outlets in all of his establishments.
MR. RIFKIND:

My understanding of the record is

that there were five.
QUESTION:

Just five.

MR. RIFKIND:

Sorae in the. public spaces, where

customers were entertained# and some in the work spaces
where the employees were .
QUESTION:

Well# that is just in the ere restau­

rant# is it not?
MR. RIFKIND:
QUESTION:

It is all in one restaurant..

And he has only one --

MR. RIFKIND:

Oh# no- he has ether restaurants but

this particular infringement was# of course# brought as a
test situation for the particular two songs that we are
talking about.
The district court granted the

plaintiff brier the

monetary damages requested# which was $250 for each
composition at the statutory rate.
As I have already stated# the Court of Appeals
reversed that and I submit that 2 can state with confidence

7
that the business purpose behind the selection of any one
of the methods by which Alton coaid hate supplied musical
entertainment to his guests and employees was identical.
It was to entertain guests and it was to improve
the efficiency of his employees.

This much, I believe, is

clear on the record and all of these methods, whichever one
he selected, would have to have recourse to music created by
composers and made available to the public by means of
either sheet music, records, tapes, piano rolls or broadcasts
of electrical impulses and I suggest that until the Third
Circuit had spoken it was firmly established that no mettor
by which method Aiken entertained his guests and employees .
he was bound to abstain unless he had a license from the
copyright owner, such as ASCAP, of course and of course,
such licenses were universally available under the compul­
sion cf a decree which is enforced with respect to ASCAP.
I believe that it is still unquestioned that live
performances in the restaurant by live muscians would be
subject to the copyright laws and subject to Section I
thereof and that has' been true, certainly, since
Mr. Justice Holmes wrote Herbert against Shan ley way back
in 1917.
I believe' it is still Uneuesfcicnbdt:hat ';:h- record,
roll
tape, piano/method or electronic method of Muzak is a
public performance for profit and, indeed

" so the Third

Circuit itself upheld on

i:

ividber oi tivtifs.

And now the Third Circuit has decided that the
last method, namely, the radio-p!
jh realistically and. functi
from any of the other methods of furnishing the music is,
for some reason', beyond the reach of Section I of the Copy­
right Act, although it is public, although it is profit —
for profit -— but the Circuit Court said it is not ei
performance and at arriving at chat conclusion, that Ah res
not a performance, it said that it acted under the compul­
sion of this Court's mandate as expressed in the two CAPV
cases, the Fortnightly case and the Tolaprompter case and
it is that determination cf the Court of Appeals that I
most distinctly want to challenge,
We challenge id and wo
several grounds.

challenge that do coal on on.

We assert first that the old landmark

decision rendered in 1931 entitled Buck against JewellLaSalle and reported in 283rd U.S. by a majority court in
an opinion written by Mr. Justice Brandeis controls this
case and that the judgment, therefore should have gone for
the Petitioner.
We also assert that 3uck against JeteII-LaSalle
can coexist in the same legal universe at fortnightly and
Toleprompter and that there is no incowpatAbility between
them because For ..nightly and Teleprompter, unlike this case,

9

Mere concerned with a new technological developwent, never
prior thereto brought within the copyright oyster and never
subjected to copyright royalty burdens and restpecfcivoly
Congress had been quite certain.
And? thirdly, that in any event, private arrange­
ments have for over 40 years been made between the creatore
and consumers of music in reliance on Jewell-LaSalle and
that Jewell-baSalie therefore ought to be allowed to survive
until Congress directs otherwise.
As far as the Congressional voice is concerned,
if I can read the incomplete compositions of imrrtsst body, I
can sav that it seems to be targeted towards the continued
viability of the doctrine of Jewei1-LaSalle.
Now, to develop some of those points a little
more explicitly,

in a sense this case is, of course,

concerned with the construction of the section of the copy­
right law, Section 1 thereof and that is of primary
.interest to the authors, composers and publishers of music
whom the founding fathers expressed the desire to encourage
in the copyright and patent clause of the Constitution.
But from the point of view of the

development of

our jurisprudence X believe that more is involved than
whether Respondent Aiken has to pay $5 a month for the
privilege of entertaining his business guests and improving

the morale of his employees with music created by the

10
copyright owners•
1 suppose that the state».to means exactly' what ttirCourt declares it means and as 1 stated n little while ago,
every since 1931, which is:: 44 y

. s ago, the r.etwh-o or

that statute was made plain in the car:: •.•hot X hare cited,
Buck against Jewel 1-La3allea
It declared that Section I meant that one situated
exactly like Aiken in this case and who did exactly what
Aiken did in this case, subjected himself to liability as
an infringer of copyright unless he was licensed to do what
he did.
The Court of Appeals in its analysis acknowledged
that the case here under review is on all fours with the
facts of the case in Jev^U-LaSalle,

Over 5,000 contracts

ere now extant that we know of which have been entered into
in reliance and in observance of JewelI-LaSalle and in
case, Mr. Justice Brandeis for’ the unanimous

Court said,

’Taere is no difference "•■11 we give yea the exact language,
n£ I may.
"There is no difference in substance between the
case where a hotel engages: in orchestra to furnish the
music and that where, by means of the radio set and loud™
speakers here employed, it furnishes the seme r-.usio few the.
same purpose."
QUESTION *

Xs not there one difference, Mr. Rifkind,

11
in this sense, possibly «— I’ll put it as a question:
Do you think there is a difference, since the
radio station is selling advertising, presumablyr and I
would assume that as a matter of economics the advertising
rate is based upon the coverage of the radio station, -that
it differs from the orchestra in the sense that the orches­
tra has no advertising and the radio station is getting -v
the radio station having paid the royalty -- is getting a
larger income because of the. expanded audience of restau­
rants, hotels, business establishments, et cetera.
MR. RIFKIND:

Let. me explain that most explicitly.

The rates established between the licensing organisation,
in this case, ASCAP, which speaks for the owners of these
compositions, and the radio industry, is determined under a
system which is subject to judicial surveillance under the
decree in United States against ASCAP which has been
administered in the southern district of New. York since

1940 and amended

in 19‘30 if ray history and ray recollection

of the dates is correct, •end I believe that it is.
These termo ara negotiated in terms of what rights
are conferred upon the broadcaster.

In this particular

situation, broadcasters are expressly excluded from the
right of conferring any authority upon people in Aiken's
position and, consequently, the rate that they pay takes
into account tie fact that ASCAP will collect another fee

12
from the Aikans of this country and therefore, the fee paid
by the broadcasters, doss not overlap the
agency.
The District Court and the Court of Appeals both
agreed that the circumstance that the

radio station in

Jewe3.1~LaSalle was unlicensed and that hers it -t/as licensed
was a difference without significance.
The —* I have explained why the suggestion thatMr. Justice Brandeis made in the-footnote, as I believe
Mr. Justice Rehnquist calls attention, that there might
conceivably be — the argument might be made that there is
an implied license is no longer valid because 'in 1932 that
was explicitly excluded.
Logically, I should say r the suggestion of an
implied license underscores the conclusion that the hotel
or Aiken was performing and performing publicly for profit
because if he was not performing, or not performing
publicly and for profit, there would be no point in talking
about, a license.
It is only public performance for profit that
requires a license.

So Mr. Justice Brandeis' discussion of

a possible implied license necessarily emphasizes his view
that there was a performance and, of course, a performance
for profit.
Now, the Third Circuit seemed to be under the

13
impression that Jewel I~A.-a-:Aa lie had been overruled by tills
Court and I believe that therein, again, X find myself in
sharp disagreement with that court.
I suppose it cannot be challenged that this Court
has never yet uttered the fcalismemic phrase which actua.ll/
would de canoni so Jewel 1-La,Salle.
This Court had said in Fortnightly that Jeweli1-'
LaSalle should be understood as limited to its own facts.
The facts here are the very facts to which the Court said
they should be limited to and that is the very converse of
treating it as overruled.
Words of limitation to facts, a phrase not unusual
in the opinions of this Court, X have always thought meant
that the principle of the case may no longer be regarded
as an axiom from which new theorems and new propositions
might logically be deduced.
The Court of Appeals went much further than that.
It has acted in reliance on the anticipation that this
Court will overrule Jewell and we entertain the hope that
that prophesy is not a valid one.
We contend that the Court should not overrule
Jewell.

Indeed, ws assert that this case presents the

conspicuous example of the salutary purposes of the rule
of stare decisis.
Eirsfc, as I have already mentioned, very many

many people have shaped their business conduct in obser­
vance

of and in reliance on that case.
Moreover, the rule offends no moral Principles.

It does not offend good judgment, as is evidenced by the
fact that all over the world Jewe11-loSalle is, in fact,
lived by and if it should appear that this Court thirds
that some different policy should now prevail, it sieras to
me that the proper agency to grapple with that is the
Congress,
And, indeed, the Congress is grappling with that
problem at this very

moment.

As your Honors know, the

Copyright Act has been under active consideration by the
Congress for soma time and the delay in the new bill has
been not Jerne 11-LaSa3.le but the delay has been caused by
the inability of the Congress to decide what to do about
CATV.
Fortnightly, the first CATV case, was the first
occasion on which the Jewell decision .was
in this Court.

ever questioned

In that esse, there were a number of ..

there was one dissent and three non-participants.
In that case, the Court confronted a brand-new
industry which had never been subjected to the copyright
system, a new technology and then, in 1974. the Court
encountered a further development of that same technology
i:a Fortnightly, which brought signals beyond the realm of

the original antenna.
But neither the majority nor the minority in either
of those cases suggested that Jgwell should be overruled.
The majority never even mentioned Jewell in the last Teleprompter case and no justice expressed the thought that
hotel-keepers and restaurantears were free to entertain
guests and stimulate employees by the free use of their
musia =»
Aiken's behavior belongs in the unsophisticated
realm of what we are fully familiar with and it; wouldn't
be a bad idea, therefore, to see how the world regards
that kind of behavior.
I shall be brief and say that Great Britain,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Germany and every
ether country I could find any evidence of treats Aiken's
performance as breech of the copyright privilege.
In the functional sense, which is the idea
introduced into this field by the decisions in Fortnightly
and Teleprompter, comparison was made to the viewer
erecting a giant antenna and I would like to suggest that
another way to look at it would be as if it was a giant earcrumpet which made it possible for the listener to get
signals which otherwise he couldn't hear end here is the
pomt I want to malts, the distinction between those two
kinds of cases.

MR, RIFKIND:

That is a fair question,

I think

the real question is, is the barber playing that music for
his own entertainment or is he doing it for a business
purpose?

that he is doing it for the pleasant reaction of his

MR» RIFKIND:

I will only report that the practice,

the practice has been to impose no royalty charge on the

case — your Honor suggests to me one where .It is stipulated

I think that

if it was stipulated for business purposes, then technically
speaking he would be performing publicly for profit and be
subject to a charge.
But as a practical matter, no licensing organisa­
tion that I know of has over pursued such a course of
conduct.
QUESTIONHow about a dentist's office?
MR. RIFKINb:

Same thing.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD DAVID COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. COHEN:

Mri Chief Justice, and members of

the Court:
The argument of my distinguished adversary has a
captivating sound but, essentially, I believe it begs the
very question in dispute.
put his

I think Mr. Justice Stewart bars

finger on the point.
The question is whether hue Court of Appeals

erred in deciding that when Mr. Aiken, in his fast foods
shop, where he has people in for net more than 15 minutes
at the most, 60 percent of the customers' come in and pick
up the delicatessen and take it out within two or three
minutes.

I. would agree ■■•'ith no loomed brother teat
Mr. Aiken hired the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to per­
form in his fast food establishment or a trio of musicians
or he put in complicated equipment whereby he could, go out
and buy tapes, select tapes and decide when they should be
run, without commercials and perhaps with some advertise­
ments for Aikens, that he might well bo chargeable with
infringing the copyright of the music he performed but that
is not this case.
We are concerned wit!'; the simple question whether,
on this particular day, in this one store — and the record

to call it a restaurant

is s. euphemism

whether on this day he engaged

radio broadcasts came through the air to his store and were
heard by his three employees and such customers as happened
incidentally to be on the premises.

The Buck

X think it might

run afoul of another provision or section or part of Section

That Is, there is an exclusive

MR, COHEN:

And I am sure that whe-: this

he says, we can reach people whether they are at their
home or in their ears driving to or from their homes or
whether they are in stores or whether they are waiting in
doctors' offices or whether they are sitting in a barber's
chair or wherever.
In other words, he tries to maximise his audience
so that his revenues will be greater and, in turn,

ASCAP

profits because the amount which it receives from the
broadcaster is a percentage of the broadcaster’s revenues.
So what, in effect, they are trying to do here,
stripped of some of the language, - is to exact a double
payment.
There is nothing in the record that indicates that
when they go to the broadcaster they say- well, we are not
going- to charge you as much as we otherwise might because

we are going to get Mr. Aiken to giv-a us $60 a year, so we
are going to take — deduct that from the amount that you
are going to have to pay.
QUEST.! OKs

Well, Mr. Rifkind rayo they have been

doing that for 40 yearc and they are doing it on the
authority of Jewell-LaSalle.
MR. COHEN:

It is curious,- indeed, that if, for

40 years, they have been doing it, they have 3,150 licenses
I think we can take notice of the fact that there are
hundreds of thousands of establishments in this country
like Mr. Aiken's, barber shops, beauty salons, doctor's
offices, if you will, restaurants and if they have 5,000
licenses and these are hotels and motels and large super­
markets and the like, it does not show that they have
vigorously relied upon Jewell-laSalle as a basis for -—
QUESTION:

Does that include Muzak, the 5,000

figure?
MR. COHEN:
Muzak.

No, the 5,000 figure does not include

Muzak is a performer.

That is, the Muzak franchise

which supplies or actually performs a music to the business
establishment, does perform, does pay a royalty to ASCAP
and that is separate and that will continue to bo paid in
whatever amount the Court may deem reasonable and nondiscriminatory, that will continue to be paid regardless of
the outcome of this case.
QUESTION:

Do you think this case is factually

MR. COHEN;
QUESTION:

Is factually distinguishable —
In any rational manner.

23
Mb, CbhFN:

Well, certainly, kiie - ground that you

inaxcated, namely the license implied in this case — which
may bo implied in this case by virtue of the fact that the
broadcasting station was authorized in Pittsburgh, whereas
the broadcasting station in Kansas City in the JewellLaSalie case was not authorized by the copyright owners,
is a significant point of distinction.
QUESTION:

But I thought the terms of the license,

to the broadcasting station negated any authority on its
part

to license anyone else.
MR. COHEN3

We are not saying that there is

necessarily a license implied in fact.
is a license .implied in law.

But there certainly

I do not believe that AS CAP

can contrive language whereby they can say to a broadcaster,
we are going to license you to broadcast — that is,
disseminate to the public our compositions and we want you
to pay us a royalty.
These are to go over the air to all members of the
public and then say that Mr. Aiken or

his customers, who

are members of the public, cannot receive those broadcasts
without payment of a fee.
Another point of distinction, of course, is that
if we got into the quantitative test which, of courne, has
since been discarded by this Court, obviously, what
Mr. Aiken has done in his store, which is a small room with

24
two outfits in ths ceiling of the public area — or two
speakers are located

and three other speakers, oh-s in

the washroom, the girlsr washroom, one in the kitchen end
erne in the office for his employees, is vastly different
from the complicated mechanism of the larga master radioreceiving set in Jewsil-LaSalle which piped music to 2CO
rooms throughout the hotel or in the Statler Hotel cane in
New York where they had a radio engineer and two assistants
on top of the building and they piped music through the
ducts to 1,900 rooms and they held it was a performance
upon the authority of Jewell-haSalle.
That is not this case.

However, I am not relying

upon that because I think this Court has clearly stated, in
the Teleprompter

case and on the Fortnightly case before,

that viewers of television

and by a parody of reasoning,

listeners to radio broadcasts, do not perform.

The broad­

casters perform.
It is difficult to conceive functionally how
Mr, Aiken can be said to be performing music in his
establishment when he

has; no control -over what is being

broadcast, when it is being broadcast.
He has no dealings with advertisers.

He has no

idea of the tempo of the music or the kind of the music
that is coming over, except as Kr. — Judge r.ii:
cut

pointed

Of course, he may select one station because he

thinks it may be more pleasing to him or people in his
store, particularly his esrgployaes, than another station,, but
the fact is, he does not attempt to edit anything that
comes over.

He gets the commercial announcements„

He

gets the station identifications, the public service
announcements, the news, as well as the music
1 am sure that it would put an unbearable strain

upon the ordinary meaning of performance to have someone
sitting in Mr. Aiken's shop consuming a. hamburger, regarding
Mr. Aiken as the performer of the music.

and there is nothing that Mr. Aiken does to intervene
between that broadcast and the listening by the people,
primarily his employees.
QUESTIONS
MR. COHEN:
QUESTIONs

Incidental -—

Mr. Cohen.
Yes, sir.
What about a record player that is

hooked up fcc an amplifier system?
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

Well, the record player, I would say —
A record player or tape — a

tape

player, either one.
MR. COHEN:

Well, I would, say — I would be

inclined to say that that would, be a performance because
of the special provision in the statute.

But if he has a

record player or a tape machine, he goes out and buys the

26
or selects the tapes.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

And selects

what he wants.

Selects what he wants, has control

over what is being sent out and presumably he can inter­
sperse his own commercial announcements.

He may say, for

the next five minutes you can get Aiken's chicken at .10
percent off.
He could not do it here.

Well, what if he doesn't?

That is clearly a performance.

Yes,
As a juke box, so-called.
Well, the juke box — there is a

special exemption for juke box

in the law which Congress

is trying to modify to have an $8 juke box charge imposed.
So far as the legislation is concerned on which
Mr. Rifkind depends, I think it is pretty hard to find in
the silence of Congress over these last 10, 15 years, any
indication that Jewe 11 --LaUa 1 le must be adhered to.
Otherwise, this entire complex of business
relationships in going to fall,
QUESTION;

Well, do you think this Court in

Jewell — in Te.leprompter, rather, intended to overrule
Jewel1-LaSalle, which was a unanimous statutory decision
on which presumably property rights have been established?

ME. COEBNs

Wall, obviously, this Court did not

use the word “overrule."

And I think the Supreme Court;

generally is reluctant to state explicitly that a former
decision of the Court is overruled but to say that •layailLaSalle must be understood to be limited to its awn factual
context and to undermine the basic rationale of JewellLaSalle , the basic premise on which Jewall-LaSalle was
decided, namely, that there is a performance becans • of
this — of what the hotel did by having this elaborate
equipment and substitute the functional analysis test of
Fortnightly and Teleprompter, obviously, in effect,
emasculates -Jew-all--LaSallej the vitality of Jewell--LaSad ic­
is not what it was prior to Fortnightly decision.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr.. Cohen, it is —• I think the

phrase was, it. is li.yitei, must to understood to be limited
to its own facts.
MR. COHEN;
QUESTION;

Right.
And one of the facts in Jswell-LaSe.1 J.e-

was that the broadcasting station was unlicensed.
MR. COHEN;

That was an important fact, as I

pointed out previously.
QUESTION;

And that is one of its own facto.

MR. COHEN;

That is right.

Now --

QUESTION;

From what you have said, Mr. Cohen,

I take it that ar.l of your arguments would top.it equally to

28
fche factual situation we have here and the hypothetical
restaurant/ iat us say, that seats 1,000 people — if there
are such *— with 20 different rooms and in each room there
was one outlet,
MR. COHEN:

It could use radio broadcasts.

think it would logically.

I

The difference comes, of course *

a restaurant of that kind, as the restaurant in the
Herbert. v. Shanley case to which ray adversary alluded, may
go

in for a much different type of entertainment.
To say that the business motivation of Mr. Aiken

is like that of a hotel owner in Herbert vt Shanley, seems
to me to be fictional.
The Vanderbilt Hotel in New York was concerned
with the ambience of its hotel restaurant so it had an

in

orchestra play and it

had some valuably

liverled waxtor s

and it had fine napkins and tablecloths.
That is not true of an establis hraent of this kind
which is willing to have just the radio corae in and have
two speakers in the public area where the sound can be
audible evenly throughout the premises.
The point is that my adversary is attempting to
draw a line which I think is an arbitrary one,' an artifi­
cial onef between having a radio behind the counter encased
in one cabinet — that is, it might have one speaker or
two speakers — and that would not be a performance but he

29
did have that .in this particular aha;? but he found it
blared if you

ciocr to it, if yon hoard it too broody.

If you were a little farther away, you right not
hear it as well and if it blared- it interfered with
conversations with customers so, instead, he. had r.poakers..
Nov/, it is not unusual these days- I am told — in
facte it is quite common when you buy a radio, to have
speakers outside of the tuning device and you may put than
10 feet

away, you may have them in the other part of the

room or you may put"it in another room.
Mr.

But so far as-

Aiken's "performance" is concerned, he did nothing

more than install this equipment.
He die-' not manipulate it once it was installed and
it is no different than if he had just one unit with the
speakers encased in the; cabinet- so far as his function
relative to the-

broadcasts were concerned, was concerned.

.1 think the reasoning of this Court in the Fortnightly

and Tele prompter cases is dispositive of ASCAP’s

claim.

I think the Court of Appeals correctly perceived it

to be.

It is certainly illogical, I -would think, to declare

that the function of a cable system has little in. common
with the function of a broadcaster because like viewers and
unlike broadcasters, they do not perform the programs they
receive and carry and then turn around and hold Mr, Aiken
to be engaged in a performance.

30
Mr, aiken is obviously on t.v.e listening aids- of
the line,
As a matter of fact in the Fortnightly case and

Teieprompter» many CATV systems served commercial establish­
ments as well as subscribers in their homes.

To say, on

the one hand, that the CATV system is on the listening side,
or the viewing side of the line but Mr, Aiken, '.-."ho is a
subscriber jumps over to the performing side of the line
seems to me to be arbitrary.
QUESTION;

Now, what would be the situation of

the Aikens if the proposed new statute comes along?
MR. COHEN;

Well, the proposed new statute is

rather complicated.

I must take issue with ray friend,

.Judge Rif kind.
QUESTION:

You mean, you are liable to be here

even under the new statute, making the same argument?
MR. COHEN:

I think the new statute attempts •—

and I have the legislative history in the case of estab­
lishments such as Aikens, small establishments, barber
shops or so forth, would not be subject to liability and
also, I may point out, that the statute provides that there
may be transmissions even by a hotel to guest rooms without
incurring any copyright liability.
As a matter of fact, the .legislative history will
disclose that even ASCAP, Judge Eifkind1s client, did not

attempt to enforce Jewell-LaSalle agai
piped music to guest rooms.
After the Statior case in New fork was a victory
for HESAC, SESAC, which is a counterpart of ASC.W,

there

apparently was some question whether this was a performance
for profit.

At any rate, the legislative history discloses

that there was very little attempt to enforce the rights of
the performing rights of organisations against hotels which
transmitted programs to private rooms

and hotels, coven

though Jewe.11-3.aSa 1 is presumably gave them that right under
the Jewe 11-LaSal.le construction of the 1909 Act.
So the answer to the question, Mr. Justice Brennan,
is that I would be foolhardy if I attempted to prognosticate
the effect of pending legislation.
As you know, there has been — they have been
studying the revision of the copyright law since 1955.
-here was an authorization from Congress to the copyright
office.

Extensive studies were made.

Thera was — e refer

e--., iu report in 1161 ;r; briny the culmination of the
studies but my opponent’s reply brief said it was not the
culmination but, of course, the foreword to the report is
that it is the culmination of studies.
At any rate, there were a lot of comments and
discussions and compromises and they carae out with &
statute.

They passed one House, as Judge Rifkind pointed

32
out, did not pass the other.
1 do not know what may eventually come out of this
but, certainly, we ara concerned here with the construction
of an existing statute and if this Court? in 1931? decided
a case on a premise or doctrine which has been found not to
be found? not to be logical, it should be the responsibility
of

this Court to correct that decision? not to wait for

Congress to correct it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about four

minutes left? Mr. Rifkind.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON II. RIFKIND? ESQ.
MR. RIFKINDs

I gathered? as I listened to xcy

learned friend? that there might be a distinction drawn
between Jews11 -• LaSalle and this case and that the station
try

Jewell-LaSalle? the broadcast station? was unlicensed

find here it is licensed.
I think the argument advanced by one of the
dissenting justices in Fortnightly? Mr. Justice Fortis
QUESTION:

Hs was the only dissenting justice.

MR* RIFKIND:

The only — excuse me- your Honor.

Of course you are right.

I was thinking

for the moment

of Teleprompter.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RIFKIND:

In Fortnightly, he pointed out that

the interpretation of that term, "perform/' cannot logi­
cally turn on the question of whether the material that is
used .is licensed or not licensed and I don't think there is
any way of meeting that logical proposition.
More importantly, we have the — the distinction
of an unlicensed station was judicially first noticed and
abandoned back in 1937 when Judge Woolsoy in the Southern
District decided the Hotel Statler case and since then, and
before then, never once in all the literature on this
subject, in all the discussions of the copyright office,
in all the legislative discussions, has there boon so much
of a trace of a distinction attributable to this coined
cent xl effect.
I can't see how logically it can play the role.
I heard the argument advanced that perhaps
Aiken's performance was not for profit.
suggestion that the customers only

You keoupd

spent a little bit of

time there and so on and so forth.
Well, on the merits, of course that issue has been
resolved by y-orbert against Shanley where Mr. Justice
Holmes made the cogent remark, "It is true that music is
not the sole object and

neither is the food," he said.

If music didn't pay, it would bo given up."
M;c„ Aiken spent money to furnish music to his
customers.

He must have regarded it as money well-spent.

I

34
I say, the issue be Ice* is treated as sjstnbliehed.
Indeed, it was not challenged seriously, as the Court of
Appeals pointed out.

So that the issue is not ronllg

this Court.
The petition for cert didn't mention it..

Neither

did the answer for petition for cert.
To suggest now at this late stage of this case,
this Court should consider whether only music which is
offered for sale by a ticket at the door is within the
copyright statute, I think that is to extend the implication
to this case far beyond what we are now confronting.
There was a question as to how many licenses of
this kind-were outstanding and the figure was given
correctly, over 5,000»

But what was not stated is that

there are 75,000 establishments which use Musak,

so Z do

not know and have no evidence of any information that there
are lots of Aikans around this country.
But even if there were, that would not. change the
facts.

If the copyright owners have a right against

Aiken, they have a right to enforce it.
The suggestion was made that eve’s though the
implication — the suggestion of an implied license in
no longer tenable, in fact, because tb•

license to the

radio station expressly excluded it# that there was sovo
kind, of a doctrine

by which AS CAP was prohibited from.

35
entering into that

of an arx rxgerent with the broad

cast station»
Well, ail I can say is., is that that 1:3 a starVli;ag
notion.

Every time a piece of sheet music is sole' at the

comer store, it is — confers authority upon the buyer to
play it in his home,

That doesn’t mean that he may give a

performance for profit on that sheet music and escape
royalty obligations.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentleman.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:56 o'clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
