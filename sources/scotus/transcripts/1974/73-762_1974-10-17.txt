MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Sosna against Iowa.
Mr. Reynolds, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES II. REYNOLDS ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. REYNOLDS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, first of all, this is
requirement case.
Court is aware.

a

durational residency

It is a developing area of the lav;, as the
We are raising the constitutional question

of the Iowa durational residency requirement for access to
the domestic courts of Iowa.

It's an Iowa statute requiring

one year residency before you have access to the courts.

We

are raising it —
QUESTION:

Mr. Reynolds, is that precisely true?

Straighten me out because I have a misapprehension here
perhaps.

Does one year residential durational requirement

apply if the defendant is also a resident of Iowa?
MR. REYNOLDS:

No.

If both of the parties move into

Iowa together, then it does not apply; only if one of the
parties moves in and the other party is not a resident.
QUESTION:

This is rather unusual as compared to

most statutes, is it not?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

I believe it is.

Would the statute be harder for you to

4
attack if it applied across the board to a situation where a
defendent was a; resident?
MR. REYNOLDS;

I think the narrower the classifica­

tion the easier it is to argue on an equal protection question
if there's no rational relationship to the narrow group that
is excluded.

And I think that ours, because it is a more

narrow restriction, is probably easier to argue because of the
fact that it applies only to nonresidents where there is a
nonresident party, out-of-State party.

In other words, if

both moved into the State
QUESTION;

Even for a week?

MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

Even for a week.

Actual residence even for only as long as

a week?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

For some reason the State

feels it has some compelling interest over parties which are —■
when one of them isn't in the State.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that an obvious background,

the divorce mill State problems that we had for a number of
years when there were only about three States — Florida, Nevada,
I guess?
rA

MR. REYNOLDS:
think that

I think that's probably true, but I

probably the reason for it is the durational

residency requirement has caused divorce mills to occur.

I

think the striking down of such durational residency requirements

5

will take care of that problem and that the States can
litigate the proper status of those parties in the State where
the real interest lies.
QUESTION:
isn't the States

But isn’t there quite a difference —

different, quite different when both the

husband and the wife come into the State and are subject to
its jurisdiction, giving indications that they are going to
make that the family home, as distinguished from your case?
MR. REYNOLDS:

No.

I think that in the instance that

if we used the criterion that we advocate as the real
jurisdictional question which the Court has said in the past
to be the jurisdictional question, which is domicile, that
the domicile of the party is the real interest which the State
has, and the fact

of

the domicile of the other party is

only peripheral to the interest that they have because of the
many concomitant things that go with the marital situation,
such as the severance, such as the custody, support, division
of property, and the attendant other things that go with it,
such as in Iowa we have a requirement of reconciliation,
injunctions that would be necessary or
peace or property.

proper to preserve the

And these things, we feel, are the real

issue and that the citizen has in the divorce court, non­
resident or a resident domiciliary of the State who cannot
overcome the - jurisdictional one-year requirement, he cannot
have, for instance, the severance of the relationship which is

6

possible to a nonresident who moves in with his spouse and
then the other spouse would, for instance, move out after the
action has been commenced,

if there is a severe reason for

an immediate severance, we don't have to wait the 90 days that
are normally required for divorce.

But if one party was from

out of the State, they would have to wait a full year and 90
days possibly, or at least a year, before they could have
access to the court.

The custody of the offspring — and I

feel this is very important and why many times access to the
court is quite urgent because of the fact of the ramifications
of the separate families if we don't make the ties cut off,
that the ramifications and the effect upon children and the
offspring of the marriage can be affected to a great extent
and that therefore you should be able to get in, at least as
far as support of the parties are concerned and that the
custody questions can be litigated so you don't have the
situation of parties running from State to State with children
trying to get the other State to give them custody, that we
could get these matters litigated and that the offspring could
be better protected if they have a chance to get to the court,
and the support of those persons, the division of the properties,
so that there could be certain injunctory orders entered to
preserve the status quo so that the disposition of the propert
that the parties if they are living in another State don't
dispose of the properties or do something with them, so that

7

when it comes time to take care of the offspring, that there
are things available.

For instance, in our statute, the

counseling, there is no counseling.

The State of Iowa has

maintained that one of the purposes of the one-year residency
requirement is that it is somehow going to preserve the union.
We feel, however, that immediate access to the courts would
allow

the order for some type of counseling which may be

more beneficial than having two parties in separate States
sitting and wondering about the situation for a year.
QUESTION:

You did present this question to the Iowa

courts, I gather?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

We tried to.

You presented it in your pleadings, didn't

you?
MR. REYNOLDS:

We presented it in the pleadings,

and the fact that we are required under the statute in question
to plead the fact of one-year residency requirement —
QUESTION:

And it was rejected, your claim was

rejected?
MR. REYNOLDS:

The claim was rejected by Judge Keck.

He rejected it not on the basis that he passed on the question
and as he said, he felt he wasn't in a position to pass upon
the constitutional question when the statute upon its face
seemed to be quite certain and he didn't want to go to the
constitutional issue.

8
QUESTIONS
claim.

He didn't want to, but he rejected your

You presented it to him.

Why didn't you appeal in the

Iowa courts, carry the constitutional issue through the Iowa
courts?
MR. REYNOLDS;

Because of the status of the cases

at the time, it appeared that the only preservation under a
situation where there was little or no dispute about the
statute itself, that the State courts have been very reluctant
to get into the constitutional issue.
QUESTION;

You could present it to them and they

could reject it.
MR. REYNOLDS;

We could present it to them again,

and reject it, but the court system then was in fact depriving,
under 1$>83, was depriving the citizen of his civil rights
which had been by history the prerogative or had been —the
place it had been litigated was in the Federal court, and
therefore the Federal court would foe the proper forum to
litigate this when in fact the State law which was depriving a
citizen of the United States of a constitutional right —
QUESTION:

You felt that within your pleadings in the

State court you challenged the constitutionality of the
statute?
MR. REYNOLDS;

No.

The constitutionality of the

statute was raised by the special appearance of Mr. Sosna, who
then raised the special appearance, and then it was litigated

9
not by us but by them, because the question had been raised
as to his right to be litigated.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. REYNOLDS;

It was then litigated.

It was then litigated.

I don't like the term "litigated”.
was litigated.

I don't feel it

We tried to present the case and Judge Keck

said that he didn't want to pass upon that, and I don't think
he ever intended to make a judicial decision on the

t

constitution issue.
QUESTION;

What did he do to your complaint?

MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

Dismissed it.

Well, then, certainly he decided that

you have no claim.
MR. REYNOLDS;

No, he didn't decide we had no claim.

He just said that the statute says that you cannot have
access to our courts, period.
QUESTION;

Why aren't you bound by that?

Under the

lav; of res judicata why are you free to go into Federal
court and relitigate that?
MR. REYNOLDS;

Because we are going back into the

Federal court and litigating really the State.
party was Mr. Sosna.

The original

We have now different parties, and

we are talking about the State, the State under color of law
is trying to deprive us of a constitutional right, the right
of access to the courts to litigate a very essential and

10

necessary right, which is that of the marriage relationship
and all of the concomitant things that arise from it, we feel
a very basic right.
QUESTION?

Here was a pending case in a State court

system that wasn’t final?

I mean you had appellate opportunities

to carry this constitutional question through the State court
system.

Why should a Federal court get into it at that point?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Because of the fact of the status

of the law at the time, the law was very certainly put to the
question of durational residency requirements had been struck
down in the past by other Federal courts, and I think if you
look in our brief, you can see when you split up the cases
between those that have sustained the durational residency
requirement and those that have struck it down, it has been
almost a majority in the State courts, and the Federal courts
however have always vindicated the rights, the constitutional
rights, because that had been the proper forum.

And when it

was, as the court said, a very certain statute on its face,
there wasn't any way normally that you say, O.K., we will go
litigate it further in the State court if there is any chance
that you might have a chance of changing the opinion or having
the matter, at least in 1983 cases, that there could be some
construction of the statute which would in fact give you
vindication of those rights and that there 'would be no such
vindication, then it’s superfluous to require them to proceed.

11
QUESTION:

How can you assume that the Supreme

Court of Iowa would not apply the United States Constitution
properly?

How can you assume that when they took an oath to

support the Constitution of the United States and the State of
Iowa?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

That's true.

You say they won't follow the Federal

Constitution.
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

No, what I was saying was —

I thought you said they wouldn't decide

in your favor.
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think it has been historically true

that they can find a decision or a reason more compelling
which would justify the durational residency requirement.
QUESTION:

You say"they”; who do you mean?

MR. REYNOLDS:

The Supreme Court of Iowa could find

a more sufficient reason — as in our particular case, two
of the three Federal judges found —■ that this was
somehow •

going to preserve the marital situation.

If you

look at the decisions which have sustained the -- the State
court decisions which have sustained these durational
residency requirements, they have gone from pillar to post
on the reasons that they felt that somehow was going to
sustain these ■— for some reason we are going to help the
marriage or we are going to preserve a compelling State

12
interest which
QUESTION ;

Has that been challenged at the Iowa

Supreme Court
MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

— on Federal constitutional grounds?

MR. REYNOLDS;
hasn't.

The durational residency ■—

Not to the best of our research, it

The Iowa court has spoken, however, over and over

again in the past —
QUESTION;

How can you imagine what they are going

to do?
MR. REYNOLDS;

Well, I suppose you would just have

to, as a lawyer, look at what the history has been.
QUESTION;

Of Iowa?

MR. REYNOLDS;

Well, the history of State court

decisions.
QUESTION;

This is Iowa you are talking about?

MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION;

Right.

You have a unique statute in Iowa, you

have indicated to Justice Blackmun.
MR. REYNOLDS;

Well, it's unique in regards to

durational residency requirement, but I don't think it there­
fore makes it any more easy for the Supreme Court of Iowa
to decide it.
QUESTION;

Then how are the actions of other State

courts with different statutes relevant to this issue?

13
MR. REYNOLDS:

Because of the fact that they have

always found that there was some compelling State interest,
which we have felt there was no such compelling State interest
and that the Federal courts whenever presented with the case
always found that there was not a compelling State interest,
that the history of the Federal decisions in regard to the
marital relationship was that it was one of the most basic
of the relationships, and therefore to deprive someone under
color of law, whether by a court or some residency require™
ment, was in fact one of the very basic things that was at
issue and therefore the line of cases, the Shapiro and
welfare cases and Dunn and the voting cases and Memorial
Hospital and the non-emergency medical care, that these -were
all the same type of situation.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is, you felt there

was a more favorable atmosphere for your cause on the Federal
side.
MR. REYNOLDS:

I felt a more favorable atmosphere

because of the fact that that has been the forum —
QUESTION:

I know why, but on the other hand you

started your action on the State side and chose not to appeal.
MR.REYNOLDS:

Well, if we didn’t start it on a

State action, we would be in a rather moot position to go in
and say, now, we would like to start a divorce but we can't
because of the residency requirement.

If you don't start it,

14
you could then turn around and say, How do you know you really
have a broken marriage?
QUESTION;

Isn't there a Federal declaratory judgment

statute?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think there is

sure, there is

a declaratory judgment statute, but the question is whether
or not it's really at issue then.

Is it a judiciable situation

or controversy if you haven't in fact brought your divorce
action?

How do you know for sure you want a divorce?
QUESTION:

Do you have a separate maintenance

statute in Iowa?
MR. REYNOLDS:

There is a separate maintenance statute

in Iowa.
QUESTION:

You chose not to follow that one either?

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

That also has a requirement.

Mr. Reynolds, may I ask you, I notice

that the defendant from the Federal suit, that's the State,
and Judge Keck expressly pleaded -— I'm looking at page 23 now
of the appendix, paragraph (d), "The suit involves primarily
State laws or constitutions, and this Court should abstain
until Iowa Courts have ruled on such issue."
I don't see any reference in either of the district
court opinions to that issue.

Was that briefed and argued

before the district court?
MR. REYNOLDS:

The issue of the —

15
QUESTION :

Whether or not the district court should

have abstained pending resolution of this constitutional
question by the Iowa courts v;asn't briefed even?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

By either side?

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

No.

I don’t believe it was.

Arguably the question is whether or not

the Younger v. Harris kind of approach to a pending criminal
case when one seeks to go into a Federal court should be
applied where civil proceedings are pending in the State
court.
MR, REYNOLDS:

The criminal, part of it, as an

old prosecutor I know how important it is to keep your
prosecution going once you have got the machinery going, and
therefore that interest is far different than that of a civil
litigation where you are alleging that the civil litigation
and the judge under color of State law is in fact depriving
a citizen of his basic Federal constitutional right.

And I

think that’s quite different because the nature of the criminal
process, which is different than the civil process and there­
fore ibises above and maybe is a more compelling State
interest in the prosecution —
QUESTION:

I suppose that if you had immediately

after this trial court judgment, which you didn't appeal, if
you had filed a declaratory judgment action against the other

16

party to this marriage in a State court in Iowa seeking to have
the statute declared unconstitutional and the defense of res
judicata would have been raised, it would have been sustained
under Iowa law or any other lav?, wouldn't it?
MR. REYNOLDS;

On res judicata as to issue or claim

or parties?
QUESTION;

Well, with the same parties.

You couldn't

have brought another declaratory judgment action or another
piece of litigation in the Iowa courts without facing res
judicata claims, could you?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think if we had brought the case

against Iowa as against Mr. Sosna, I think we could.
QUESTION;

I am talking about the other party to

the marriage.
MR. REYNOLDS;

I don’t know how I could bring a

declaratory judgment action against another party to the
marriage.
QUESTION:
been
■

Especially after your claim had already

decided.
MR. REYNOLDS:

The marriage situation, you are

strictly litigating the marriage situation.

You can’t get

a declaratory judgment on that.
QUESTION:

If you had brought a declaratory judgment

action on the constitutionality of the statute and that claim
had already been decided in; your divorce action.

17
MR. REYNOLDS s
QUESTION:

Right.

But you think the real thing that saves

you is that you were litigating with Iowa rather than with
the other party to the divorce action.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

It's a 1933 case.

We are

saying that the State by enacting a statute is in fact
depriving us of our constitutional rights, and we have joined
Judge Keck in it because of the fact that he under color of
law is in fact depriving us of a basic constitutional right.
Otherwise you might as well throw 1983 out the window if you
are going to say if you bring a State court action and the
judges use the State court law to deprive you of your
constitutional right, you can’t raise a declaratory judgment
question as to whether or not that State law is in fact —
QUESTION:

Appeal it and then you could file for

cert here.
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

That is an alternate procedure, yes.

What you really did, instead of appealing

to the State court, you are appealing to the Federal district
court.

,
MR. REYNOLDS:

.

No, we are not really appealing to

the Federal district court; we are asking ■—
QUESTION:

What is the difference?

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well, because we are litigating —■

we started out with a divorce action.

We said we wanted a

18
divorce.

We wind up having the defense being forced upon us

and the fact you haven’t been in there a year and litigating
our constitutional rights in the State court.

Now, we then

have to turn around to the Federal court and say, We have been
deprived by the State court under the defense of no jurisdiction
and therefore we would like to have this court declare and
enjoin the court from using that defense and from throwing us
out of court, so we can have access to the State court.
QUESTION:

If you had gone to the Supreme Court of

Iowa, what would you have asked for?
MR. REYNOLDS:

The same, wouldn’t you?

We would have asked for an injunction

against maybe mandamus or something like that and then
QUESTION:

But couldn't you have appealed that one?

Direct appeal.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Direct appeal to the Iowa Supreme

Court.
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Dismissal.

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION s

Yes, we could have appealed that.

And instead of that you appealed to the

Federal court.
MR. REYNOLDS:

We went in and asked the Federal court

to declare and enjoin the State court —
QUESTION:

...

MR. REYNOLDS:

faster that way?
No, I don't think so.

At least it

19
has been my experience with three-judge Federal panels that
if you've got

civil rights that are being deprived under

color of law by a State, the quickest way you can do it,, and
it was thought to be that by the Congress, was to enact
1983.

And that, to me, I know is the quickest way to vindicate

your rights if you are being abused by the State.
QUESTION:

That brings up another related matter.

Your client has now been a resident of Iowa for much more than
a year, is that not so?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

I believe so.

Now she satisfies the requirement, does

she?
MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

She has, yes.

And she gets jurisdiction of the husband,

the defendant, by publication?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

And we could probably litigate

the status in Iowa but not the questions of personal juris­
diction as to non-Iowa in rem type things.

I mean, the

status is in Iowa, but anything else is still in New York.
Yes, you can probably get it terminated if she is willing to
give up everything, the questions that would go with it.
QUESTION:

Won't she get the same thing right now

as if we would knock the statute out?
MR. REYNOLDS:
wait the year and it's --

That's the whole point.

You have to

20

QUESTIONS

She's waited the year.

MR. REYNOLDS:

Yes, but there were important things

that —
QUESTION:

She can get the divorce right now.

MR. REYNOLDS:

But there were important things that

should have been litigated that never were, for instance, the
right and support of those children should have been litigated
and not having to wait a year while maybe Mr. Sosna might
take up other relationships.
QUESTION:

Can it be done now?

But there are other

QUESTION:

And that doesn’t give you any problem.

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION;

What doesn’t give me any problem?

The fact that it's moot so far as she

is concerned.

QUESTION:

As Judge Stephenson said *—

Is there any other named party in the

MR. REYNOLDS:

No, I believe not, but I believe the

class was acknowledged and never challenged by anyone up to
this point.
QUESTION:

Did anybody else intervene?

MR. REYNOLDS:

No.

We have had plenty of calls

about people that wanted to.
QUESTION:

Suppose it’s moot as to the named party,

what happens to the class?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I believe that there is precedent

for the class? if nothing else, it is to remand it to the

MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION:

That’s a good question.

It's no problem for me at all.

MR. REYNOLDS:

Well f Cooper v_. Cooper raises the

question, which is an Iowa decision, about a doctor from Iowa
that went out to Nevada and got a Nevada divorce, and the
Iowa court said. We can still — our support judgments and
personal judgments in regard to support and so forth, they are
ifcill going to stand, but we acknowledge the divorce in Nevada.
Now, under Iowa law, 7. question as to whether or not
she can. get a New York divorce and might have a different
question as far as the State of Iowa under the present status

of Iowa law. I believe Cooper v. Cooper was a 73rd case.
QUESTIOHs

As far as the support of the children go

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

So far as the support of the children go

MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

In other words, they granted

the divorce and the court there used their powers of determin
ing domicile of the doctor who left in October, went to
Nevada, got a divorce, came back in January, and they went
through the question as to whether or not it was domicile,
and they said, yes, it was domicile in Nevada sufficient for
the Nevada court to have jurisdiction, we will acknowledge;
his divorce —
QUESTION:

Is there anything that she can get from

us that she can’t get from the Iowa court right now» from
this very same judge you went before?
MR. REYNOLDS:

No.

She herself, no, but the class

to which she is a member, I think still can, because I think
as the State has admitted in their stipulation of facts that
it is a group so numerous, more numerous than is able to be
counted, and I think there are numbers and numbers of people
who have marital relations which are at question and that
need immediate access —
QUESTION s

We have said on several occasions,

Mr. Reynolds, that a person can’t represent a class of which
he is not a member, and I think that would probably be true

of your client now» Whatever the class night be of people
awaiting Iowa divorce requirements, your client certainly is
no longer a member of it.
MR. REYNOLDS:

At this present status, yes, she would

not be, but the class itself, and I would urge that if the
Court wants to duck the question, they would send it back so
that other members of the class who would be members would
in fact be able to join in the matter and to bring the natter
back before the Court.
I would like to reserve 5 minutes for rebuttal, if
possible.
QUESTION:

Why couldn't these people file their own

lawsuit?
MR. REYNOLDS %

I suppose they can, but as we have

indicated, it’s a matter of urgency and necessity and that's
the basic question about the marital relationship.

It's not

a matter of waiting a year, because by that time the damages
are done as to the children, the property, the relationship
itself has deteriorated, and these are matters that need
instantly.

That's the whole crux of the question.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Miss Nolan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH A. NOLAN ON
BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MISS NOLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

25
the Court, I am here on bshalf of the State of Iowa to urge
the affirmance of the court below.

The Federal district

court there did take on this civil rights action, and as its
opinion clearly states, it was convinced —
QUESTIONS

Would you raise your voice a little,

Miss Nolan.
MISS NOLAN:

Yes, sir.

It was convinced that the compelling interest test
had been satisfied and that the State of Iowa did meet all of
the requirements that have been set as standards in the
recent cases determining whether or not when a person is newly
arrived in a State it has access to its courts and access to
its rights given to citizens.
The matter below was at one time pled with a view
toward the abstention doctrine.
QUESTION:
MISS NOLAN:

And did you argue it?
We didn’t argue — I did not take part

in the hearings below, but it's my understanding it was not
argued.

And as a matter of fact, when research was done on

cases and the various standards that might come into play,
it was decided that abstention was probably not the proper
thing in this particular case, that the State could meet
its burden and that it would be of some value in this area
to have a Federal court ruling on the case being litigated.
In this connection, Mr. Justice White, you asked

26

if there was a reason for the Federal court to come in and
hear cases of this nature when it was perfectly possible for
the State courts to determine the constitutionality of their
own statute.

And I can only say to that that it appears to

be a current practice, and that the name of one case 1 can't
pronounce, but it’s a Hawaiian case, it’s been decided since
Whitehead v. Whitehead, and in that instance both Federal
courts and State courts have looked at this very same question.
And so for that reason we abandoned our position of abstention
in this case.
QUESTION;

And did you argue, in any event, collateral

estoppel based on the conclusion of the proceeding before
Judge Keck in the State court?
MISS NOLAN:

No, I don’t believe that was argued as

a matter of collateral estoppel.

Judge Keck’s decision there

was one which we believe was thoroughly grounded in the law.
It was a well-reasoned decision, and that there, too, all of
the requirements of the Federal constitutional protections
for the rights of individuals had been met.
QUESTION;

Yes, but what I was getting at, Miss

Nolan, was whether you relied on that conclusion of Judge
Keck’s disposiing adversely to this petitioner.
MISS NOLAN;
QUESTION;

To the plaintiff?
Yes.

The constitutional question,you

relied on that as collateral estoppel in this Federal courte

27
MISS NOLAN;

Well, I would say, representing Judge

Keck in his position, that he had acted under

color of State

law, yes, I guess we did.
QUESTION;
your own State court?

Miss Nolan, did you acquiesce in bypassing

by

the Attorney General?
MISS NOLAN;

I don't, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I think

that here, however, a statement was made just previously to
my arising, and that is that the plaintiffs have the right to
go to the Supreme Court of Iowa in this matter.
their time for appeal has expired.

Actually,

I don't think that is

any longer available to them.
QUESTION;

All of our questions were directed to

their right to go to the Supreme Court of Iowa at that time,
not now.
MISS NOLAN;

At that time, yes, sir, I think they

did have that right.
QUESTION:

Is your answer to Justice Marshall that

the State of Iowa is perfectly willing to bypass the State
Supreme Court and go into Federal court?
MISS NOLAN:

The State of Iowa in the last 10 years

has done a great deal to liberalize its divorce laws.
also would like to know where we stand.

We

We believe that our

Supreme Court would affirm Judge Keck's decision in this
particular case.

We don't have any reason to appeal that

28

decision.

On the other hand, if the plaintiffs in that case

chose to abandon their appeal and they bring their action in
another forum, why, we did come to that forum with the hope
that this might serve some benefit both in the State of Iowa
and in general in resolving these particular requirements for'
the protection of civil rights.
This Court is well aware that since Pennoyer v. Neff
and tne Williams v. North Carolina there has been a great deal
of controversy about divorce actions.

And when the Iowa

legislature, starting about 1967, undertook a study of the
divorce laws with the purpose of reforming them in the State
of Iowa, they were well aware of the conference work on the
Uniform Divorce Act and also they were aware of the decisions
of this Court, particularly Bston v. Eston and the Vanderbilt
v. Vanderbilt cases which talked in terms of divisible
divorce and accommodation of the parties in all of these
matters.

And it was for this purpose that we abandoned our

abstention doctrine in the lower court and attempted to meet
what the Fifth Circuit now has seemingly in the Makres_v.
Askew case; coming from Florida, what seems to be a unitary
standard showing compelling interest and overriding signifi­
cance in all matters whether they arise from due process or
from some other incident equal protection of the law.
In the case in Iowa we feel that our statute is
tailored to minimize overbredth by applying the durational

29
residency rules only in those cases where the respondent is
not a resident and cannot be served personally in the

State.

For this reason we feel that we have in re-enacting a
requirement that has long been on the books of Iowa helped
to formulate a valuable standard, and we have been pointed out
in the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act as being one of the
original States to take part in this kind of uniformity in
this area of the law.

And for this reason the Federal

district court action was argued by the State.
QUESTION:

Miss Nolan,

has the Supreme Court of

Iowa in any other case dealt with the constitutional validity
of this statute?

I think Mr. Reynolds was asked that question,

but I didn't get his answer.
MISS NOLAN:

Well, in Judge Keck's decision, which

is set out in the jurisdictional statement, there is a
reference to Korsrud v. Korsrud, that's in 242 Iowa, I believe,
45 NW2d, I think it is.

In any event, that case involved a

petitioner who originally was a resident of the State of Iowa.
He took up residence in Hawaii and attempted to obtain a
divorce there.

Then he came back to the State of Iowa on

being advised out in Hawaii that Iowa was the proper place to
bring his action and obtained a divorce without informing
his spouse who later came back and contested the validity of
that divorce on the basis that the court had not had juris­
dictional — the fact of jurisdictional basis for giving the

30

divorce, and that order was invalidated *
our own experience in Iowa, so
QUESTION:

We find this from

--

So the court applied the statute. You

don't know if the validity of the statute itself was attackea
in that case.
MISS NOLAN:

The Supreme Court did test the validity

of that statute at that time and held that there was a sham
domicile pled and it was a victim of fraud,

that the court

was a victim of fraud.
QUESTION:
MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:

The court applied the statute.
The court applied the statute.
But do you know whether or not the

constitutional validity of the statute was attacked in that
case?

Does it appear from the opinion or anywhere else?
MISS NOLAN:

In ray recollection it was attacked only

on the basis of whether or not the court had jurisdiction.

But

I think that is essential to the constitutional validity of
that particular statute.
QUESTION:

The facts were litigated, I guess, that

were in issue in that case.
MISS NOLAN:

That's right.

I think it should be mentioned here also that in
the district court this petitioner came in and the court found
that not only did the petitioner fail to allege the one year's
residence that was mandatory under the circumstances of that

31

particular action, but that also the plaintiff failed to
plead that her residence in the State had been in good faith
and not for the purpose of obtaining marriage dissolution.
This is not an issue in this particular case, but both of
these requirements are mandatory under the Iowa dissolution of
marriage statute.
QUESTION;
books?

How long has this statute been on the

You said that Iowa has recently been in the process

of changing its divorce law, domestic relations law.
MISS NOLAN;

Our dissolution statute was enacted

in 1970 and it has re-enacted this particular provision for
the protection of the absent spouse so that due process will
be accorded which was in the law previously.
how far back that goes.
the 'fifties.

I don’t know

It appears to go back at least into

I'm sorry, I didn't research that.

QUESTION;

Is the Iowa statute based on the

uniform law?
MISS NOLAN;

Well, I would say that as close as

uniform laws are uniform, Iowa's statute is the uniform law,
yes.

It contains requirements that there be an allegation of

the breakdown of the marriage relationship.

This is also one

of the reasons that we were interested in pursuing this in
the Federal court because we felt that it was necessary to
determine that the State of Iowa did have jurisdiction over
the marital status.

In this particular instance it appears

32

from the allegation in the

Federal action that the plaintiff -

and from the answers to the interrogatories, also -— that the
plaintiff's marital relationship with her husband had broken
down somewhere outside the State of Iowa and some several
months prior to her relocation in the State of Iowa.

And we

felt it was questionable as to whether or not there actually
was a jurisdiction over the marital status in the State of
Iowa, although one of the parties alleged to be domiciled there
QUESTION:

That wasn't in the Federal court? was it?

MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:

I believe it was, sir,
I thought the Federal court was just on

the statute, not on the divorce.

The Federal court didn't
ft

give a divorce, did it?
MISS NOLAN:

There were interrogatories propounded

and answered in the Federal court action, and I believe this
information is contained clearly in the answers to the
interrogatorie s.

What you really wanted was the Federal

court to put its stamp of approval on the statute.

MISS NOLAN:

33

QUESTION:

You want an advisory opinion from the

Federal court, don't you?
MISS NOLAN:

The action that was brought was for

a declaratory action, for a declaratory judgment.
QUESTION:

I mean, the action of the State of Iowa

in abandoning abstention and everything else, what you really
wanted was a stamp of approval, didn't you?
MISS NOLAN:

I would say yes, that is true.

The

State of Iowa had —
QUESTION:

I didn't know the Federal courts were

here to grant advisory opinions.
QUESTION:
MISS NOLAN:

I didn't know that.

You were the defendant.
That's correct.

QUESTION:

You didn't go into the court.

QUESTION:

She agreed.

QUESTION:

Not so very long ago, as time goes, the

prevailing law was that a wife could not acquire a separate
domicile.

That was the prevailing domestic relations lav;,

that the marital domicile was the husband's domicile and that
so long as there was a marriage between the two the wife
was incapable of acquiring a separate domicile anywhere.

Do

you knov; if any States still have that rule?
MISS NOLAN:

I don't know.

I don't think that's

been the rule in Iowa for some time because our statutes do
prevent the court to take jurisdiction —

QUESTION:

Well, obviously Iowa does,

Um-hmm.

I say, the rule that I just

summarized used to be the prevailing rule in domestic relations
law.

MISS NOLAN;

I have no knowledge of other States

in that particular regard.
QUESTION:
the mootness issue.

Miss Nolan, you heard the discussion of

is no other party in the class action.

There

What is your position

on the mootness question?
MISS NOLAN:

Well, my position on this question

before this Court is that there appears to have been a proper
appeal from a district court order, and that this Court does
have authority and power to affirm that lower court decision,
which is what we ask.
With respect to the class action as such, I think
that entire matter has now been made moot.
QUESTION:
MISS NOLAN:

You think it has been mooted?
I think so.

But I think the appeal is

preserved, or was properly preserved.
QUESTION:

You think the class action is moot, but

the appeal is preserved.
MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:

I think so.
Is the controversy between the husband

35

and the wife or between the wife and the State of Iowa?
MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:
quarter to eleven.

The controversy was ■—
Is, today, right this minute, at a

What controversy exists now?

MISS NOLAN:

I feel that the petitioner in the

original action, although not divorced in I assume the original
State of Iowa, would have only the controversy grounds that
existed at the time the action was originally brought,and that
is to have the question determined under the civil rights
sections of the Code and then to pursue any decision through
appeal to the highest court in the land.
QUESTION:

We have held that a decision, say, if

a New York court on a divorce matter would not find, say, Iowa
on the question of support of children, that that is not
res judicata.
MISS NOLAN:

Are you referring to the divisible

divorce standard?
QUESTION:

I am just trying to get you over this

little hedge.
MISS NOLAN:

Thank you, I appreciate it.

I don't have the answer, really, to the question.
I assume that this appeal was brought in good faith and that
the court took jurisdiction of it in good faith.
QUESTION:
MISS NOLAN:

Are the children in Iowa now?
Pardon me?

36

QUESTION:

Are the children in Iowa or New York?

MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:

I do not know.
Are any of the parties in Iowa now?

MISS NOLAN:

As of this morning it sounds like they

aren't other than Judge Keck and the State of Iowa.
QUESTION:

I'm not very clear whether the State of

Iowa is urging or not urging Federal jurisdiction, here.

You

leave me in a state of confusion on it.
MISS NOLAN:

The State of Iowa's position on the

Federal jurisdiction question is that the

United States

statutes appear to give to the Federal courts the power under
the civil rights law to determine questions of violations of
constitutionally protected rights of individuals where the
violations occur under color of State law? and this is the way
this case was originated and this is the way this case was
argued in the lower court.
QUESTION:

.

Many of the lower Federal courts on

class actions where the named party has dropped out of the
case remand the case to the district court where the case
started for an opportunity for others of the class to join.
You haven't briefed that.

QUESTION:

You have won below and you want to hang

onto that.

But is it since we noted probable

The answer is yes?

MR. REYNOLDS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

We had a special request that the

parties address themselves to the Younger v. Harris problem,
was that not so?
MISS NOLAN:

Younger v. Harris, we would contend that

had they pursued this appeal through the State court, Younger v,
Harris would be applicable here.

But on the other hand there

seems to be an overriding interest in getting some kind of
certainty append to these types of jurisdictional questions.
QUESTION:

If the Ibv/a courts had sustained the

statute against the Federal claim of unconstitutionality by
the litigant, there would have been the right to appeal here
to this Court.

And the suggestion is that if there is pending

State litigation on which the issue is being litigated, th
it should be pursued through the State courts and then brought
here.

But

Younger, at least in part, is based on the

notion of protecting State interests, and it's an expression
of comity to the State court system, and if the State doesn’t
want it, I suppose they don’t need to have it.
You haven't pleaded res judicata or collateral
estoppel which is normally an affirmative defense.
MISS. NOLAN:
QUESTION:
Miss Nolan, while

That is correct, we did not.
What I gather from what you have told us,

you pleaded the Younger point from that

provision of paragraph (d) that I read, you have abandoned it.
You abandoned it below and you abandon it here.
MISS NOLAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
As Justice White said, since that

doctrine protects State interests, if the State doesn't want
to be protected, I guess we don't apply the doctrine.

39

MISS NOLAN;
QUESTION:

We did abandon it below.
Aside

from the point of view of the

State, isn’t the decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa just
as good a source of certainty as the decision of a threejudge Federal court?
QUESTION:

If not better.

MISS NOLAN: 3tis, but we did not have the
opportunity of taking this case to the Iowa Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

That's right.

to the Supreme Court.

Miss Nolan, you can't abandon the moot

I mean, abandon everything else, but you

can't abandon that, can you?

The case is moot, but in order to

Court, and the one in Burney.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Right.

But I would like to point out

to the Court that in Boddle v. Connecticut, which is the other
similar case to this in which the divorce was terminated or
was not restarted was because of the fact -- or was allowed to
proceed was because of the failing to pay the fee, which is
similar to the situation here, and it was never raised by this
Court when they determined Boddie v. Connecticut, and it kind
of catches us here after the jurisdictional statement and the
matter has already been litigated with a whole new case when
we come up Before the Court.
argument

But the whole thrust of our

and the argument now is that somehow that

federalism or comity or judicial husbandry is going to be
affected by you not making a decision on this matter is not

41

the case.

When you look at the fact that there are seven or

eight State court decisions all one way and the Federal court
decisions are the other way with two of the most recent ones,
Alaska and

I believe Massachusetts,finally coming our way

and in fact the Florentino case in Massachusetts even refer
to tiie fact that the Federal court,: a three-judge panel, had
made a decision and they were very intelligent men and it
may have to even give some deference to their opinion.
QUESTION;

Did the Fifth Circuit go against you

recently?
MR. REYNOLDS;
QUESTION:

If it did, I didn't catch it.

As cited by your opposition in her

ME, REYNOLDS:
I believe so.

Is that Shiftman v. Askew in Florida?

That one decision, and the Iowa decision are

the two Federal decisions which are against us.
they had been decided at the time.

I believe

And we would urge that in

light of the decision in England v. Louisiana Medical Examiners,
a 1964 case, if you are going to apply this doctrine in 1983
cases, that you at least except our case and maybe apply it
to future cases, but that at least as far as ours is concerned,
since it was never raised at the lower level, that we not be
barred from a decision by the Court at this time and that if the
injunction is not to be granted, at least the declaratory
judgment part is to be granted and that there may be questions

42

as far as comity is concerned, but at least as far as the ques­
tion of the declaratory judgment part of it, that the Court
rule on the matter since the States apparently have deferred
to the question, at least the State of Iowa has, and that
there is a request and that the class does still exist»

It

is my understanding that the question about named party or
party in interest is simply because of the. fact that the
party in interest will in fact argue the constitutional
question.

And I believe that we have done that and the fact

that the matter may have become moot as to this particular
named party, that the other members of the class still exist
in Iowa,and for the Court's information, Mrs. Sosna is back
in Iowa, lives in Green Island, Iowa, and is there with the
children.

But there are still in Iowa the class or the other

people who are deprived who have recently moved into Iowa and
that the class does still exist and that there is still a case
in controversy, that there are still people that are being
affected in their civil rights by the State court action under
1933, and therefore —
QUESTION;

The class may exist, but she is not a

member of it.
MR. REYNOLDS:

The class still exists and we are

arguing on behalf of the class and on behalf of the appellant.
QUESTION:

But she is not a member of the class.

MR. REYNOLDS:

And I think that's only relevant as

43
to whether or not — as far as the issue on the question of
case in controversy is concerned, it is only relevant as
far as whether or not we are going to adequately represent
the class's interest, and I think we are.

I think we are

trying to argue them and doing, hopefully, a good job, and the
fact as to one member of the class

it becomes moot, whether

it's the named one or any other member,, there is going to be a
constantly changing group because of the fact that it is in
fact a durational period and people are moving in and people
will fall out of the class.

But the class will continue to

exist no matter what this Court does.
QUESTION:

Would you make the same argument if the

only named plaintiff in a class action dropped dead?
MR. REYNOLDS: I: would think so.

Or if it was an

elected official and someone else had taken his place, a
substitution.
QUESTION:

That’s not the one I said.

If the one

had dropped dead, you would make the same argument.
MR. REYNOLDS:

Yes, that the class still exists.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.]
