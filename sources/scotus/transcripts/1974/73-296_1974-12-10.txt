P R O CEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Clancy, you may pro­

ceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J, CLANCY , ESQ.
01? BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. CLANCY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it Please the

Court:
The appeal herein in the Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd..,,
places before this Court two dominant issues;

The first is

the question of the interference of Federal courts in State
judicial proceedings.

The second concerns the question of

the constitutionality of the padlock provision of the Ohio
public nuisance statute, as applied in this case to a theater
showing pornographic movies as a continuing regular course of
business.
QUESTION:

We will get to the second point, if we

agree with you on the first; is that correct?
MR. CLANCY:
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:

Yes, sir.
Is that correct?
Unfortunately, yes, sir.
Why is that unfortunate?
Well, I—
It depends on which wav we would cfo on it.
Well, what I'm saying here is I would

much prefer that, the second issue also foe decided, but because

of other circumstances, I think the first is the more important issue, yes, sir„
QIJKSTION:

And if wa do agree with von on the first

issue, we do not reach the second.
HR. CLANCY;

That’s right, Your Honor.

The particular situation here involved the showing
of 16 nomographic movies in approximately a ten-week period.
Notwithstanding the Paramount importance of the second issue,
that is that this Court should resolve the padlock provision,
Appellants would urge this Court to decide the matter on the
appeal on points 1 and 2 in the brief and hold that the
Federal District Court had no jurisdiction, no subject matter
jurisdiction, to consider the merits of the cause below be­
cause of two things:

One, under the "in ram” or "res”

exception, the "res" was under the jurisdiction of the State
court which had exclusive jurisdiction to decide that matter
to the exclusion of the Federal Court svstem.

And, two, under
-4

the "Lis Pendens" Doctrine, Pursue, Ltd. took its interest
as an assignee with notice and was concluded thereby from
filing a declaratory judgment action in the Federal Court.
There are at least three reasons why the Court should
assign priority to the first and decide the case on the first
issue.

First, this Nation is at the present time faced with

an alarming rate of growth of oorn-graphic theaters.
in every hamlet, village, township in this Nation,

They are
Contrary

5
to the statements in some news via per s , thev are not in a de­
cline anu I can explain why they are not in a decline.
Second, the public nuisance is the only way in
which this vice operation can be brought under control.
Third, the defense tactics which were employed in
this case, if allowed fcc continue as a modus operandi for
defense attorneys for such cases will destroy the efficacy of
the public nuisance approach.

The opportunity for defense

attorneys to engage in a volley ball offensive by using the
Federal removal actions and, two, Federal aruitable inter­
ference, as was accomplished in this case, must be withdrawn.
It was never intended by Congress nor the
Constitution that the Federal Court System should sit in
appellate review on State Court decisions, particularly when
those State Court decisions were final.
Similarly, the opportunity for defense attorneys
to avoid public nuisance findings in State trial courts and
to provide a springboard for a Federal declaratory judgment
action at law by successive assignments after they ere in
court on the merits, as was accomplished in this case, also
has got to be stopped.

The solution to the above problems

is to be found in the well-recognized and widely accepted
legal principle cited in points 1 and 2 of Appellants' brief:
one, reaffirmation of the "im rem" and "res" exceptions
which prevents Federal interference where the State action is

81 in rem" to prevent the volley ball offensive which has
frustrated the public nuisance concept.
Toucey v. Hew York Lifey

And I cite here

Orton v. Smith, Princess Linda of

Thurn v, Thompson and Donovan v. Dallas.
In Donovan v. Dallas, as applied to a Federal case f
this Court said that it was a matter of power or a lack of
jurisdiction.
In Drton "v. Smith that was an actual application

or

a consideration by this Court of a Federal Court saying that
the State has the power, has the "res” and it should stay out
of it.

\

Well, Your Honor/, it’s the property

The public nuisance concept attacks the property

In. a "lis pendens" action/

you are proceeding against a property.

You are required to

proceed against the property, all owners and give notice that
this action does affect the title and use of the property.
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:

Padlocking the building.
That's the same thing.

When you pad­

lock the building/you’re telling them that you are withdrawing

When you

you. give notice to all persons and

assignees with notice, that there is a good possibility that

And any person, either the. one who buys the property or the
lease, takes with notice of that,
QUESTION:

Is there no way they can purge them­

selves?
MR» CLANCY:
very definitely.

Well, there is under the statute,

They can post bond.

They can prove that

the nuisance has been abated immediately if they are brought
in under a preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

In other words, if they came in by nost­

ing a bond and showing that they were going to run a ~~

MR. CLANCY:

No question but the Court, would be

forced to say that that use v?as entirely

correct and per­

In fact, that is exactly what has happened in the

Southern California District and the Orange County Courts
which have

applied it.

They have said it is precluded for

the use of lewdness, but other uses are permitted.
Now turning to the consideration of the three-judge
court opinion on the padlock provision, in essence, the
opinion, states that even accepting the fact that these IS
pornographic movie films were shown as a regular course of

business over a 10-week period, stili the trial court could
not: padlock tine premises for a year as a public nuisance be­
cause such would be precluded under Near v. Minnesota.
QUESTIO?!:

Are you going to spend more time, Mr, Clancy

on the question of the propriety of the District Courts act­
ing at all?
MR, CLANCY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor. To get back to that—
That is a special question.

I don't

want to question you here.
MR. CLANCY:

I’m just now touching upon why the

opinion itself — why it is wrong.

Then I'm going to come

back to the procedure.
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:

I see.

Fine.

Touching upon my one answer to the

opinion is that their legal reasoning is wrong and they ask
themselves the wrong question.
reasoning are cited from
74 to 77.

Our remarks on the legal

Brumbaugh, "Legal Reasoning", pages

And we further point to the two cases cited by us

in the Appendix Case A and B, Cincinnati Properties, Inc, v.
Lais and

People ox rel Kicks v. ”Sarong- Gal.r:, we say the

Court therein asked the proper question and devoted its legal
analysis properly to that question.
In People of the Sterte of California ex rel Hicks f
the Court said, of course, just as the Court ordered for the
incarceration of a convicted, law-breaker impinges on all sorts

9

of constitutional rights, so doss the abatement order.

The

order shutting down the property excepting for a limited use
is specifically authorized, however., by Penal Code, Section
11230 which permits the closing of an offending building
against its use for any purpose for a period of one year.
The question is, therefore, not whether the order impinges on
constitutionally-guaranteed rights, but whether the statute
constitutes a permissible exercise of the State police power.
The Court then goes on to say, "The provision
in Section 11230 authorizing closure of offending property
to all uses for a period of one year, while harsh, is
constitutionally permissible."
It then says, "It is to ba remembered that the
red light abatement procedures are directed against the
offending property itself.

Their purpose, it has been said,

is to effect a reformation of the property itself."
In the Cincinnati Case, similarly, they directed
their analysis to the proper ernestion and they said, "There
being no question of fact that a business of obscenity
was carried on, the question in this case is, therefore,
really whether the State may validly define the operation in
the place as a nuisance and close it for a yeafc, padlock it
on that basis,"
The Court then went on to consider the issue itself
and it said, "The constitutional power of a State to abate

10

what has appropriately been defined as a public nuisance has
never been seriously questioned,

rodlock remedies have been

consistently provided for by most States in the areas of
prostitution, gambling and liquor violations.

It is not for

us to conclude that one or the other of these subjects vis-a-vis
the State's padlock power, should be classified, differently
than obscenity.”
They then cite

Muglio

v. Kansas, and the

word-—
QUESTION;

There is some difference between abating

a whore-house and a speakeasy and abating something that sells
books just because of the First Amendment, isn't that —
MR. CLANCY:

No, not necessarily. Your Honor.

If

you say that the public nuisance that you are going against
is a course of business and you are limited to a type of
situation where the entire business, or that part of the
business, a substantial portion of it is directed entirely to
purposes of lewdness, then you have proceeded against a ■—
in- a proper manner.
If you would apply it on the sale of one book, then,
of course, you would be in trouble.

But where you have proof,

and it is purely and simply a question of what is your proof
at the trial level, have you established a public nuisance.
If you go in at the trial court level

and the

preliminary injunction, vou show them that this is nothing but

11
an 8 x 10 building room with nothing but pornographic books,
devices, films, ct cetera, then you have met your burden of
proof

under the red light abatement as a legal statute, ana

it i.3 a question of them coming forward and saying this is not
a public nuisance, or if it was a. public nuisance, it has
been abated.

It is simply and clearly a matter of proof at

the trial level.
Wow, if at the trial level, in a public nuisance or
red light abatement action and you go in on the preliminary
injunction with no more proof than you made a purchase or one
hit, you're in trouble, or two books.

You don't show what

is a course or conduct, which shows clearly that this is
nothing more than a house of lewdness or house of
prostitution or whore-house.
matter of proof.

It is purely and simply a

It's not a question of whether or not the

statute can be applied.

It's a question of how the

prosecutor directs his atoptical evidence.

Does he show

the Court that this in truth is a house of lewdness?
If the Court were to fasten its attention on the
opinion alone, it would not really get a true picture of
what this appeal is all about.

The opinion itself -only con­

cerns itself with whether or not the padlock provision can
b® provided — can be applied in view of Near v. Minnesota.
The Court did not consider any of the other matters
which were before it.

So if you want to see what the true

12

nature of this appeal is about, yon have got to go to the
record and see what 'was .before the Court.
QUESTION:

The record/—

I take it that what you’re saying,

Mr. Clancy, that while there may be a difference between a
First .Amendment case and some other kinds of cases, that once
vou have demonstrated the

obscenity factor, then it is outside

the protection of the First Amendment, as this Court has held,
and it is like any other case.
MR. CLANCYi

Absolutely,

They'll come into court

every time and say presumptively it is First Amendment,
presumption means nothing

The

when the entire evidence shews that

the presumption doesn’t apply.
QUESTION:

You'll concede that there was a presumption

against prior restraint here, but that you have overcome it?
is that your opinion?
MR. CLANCY:
however,

Yes, sir.

In the record in this case,

it shows that the Court avoided all discussion of

those important facets of the case which give the case meaning,
matters which were-brought to the Court's attention repeatedly
in the trial brief — I'm talking now about the Federal District
Court — it was brought to the Court5 s attention in the trial
brief, in oral argument, in motions for an immediate hearing
on motions to dissolve the temporary restraining order, to
dismiss the complaint as being a sham pleading, and dismiss the

23
complaint as failure to state a cause of action and in two
motions for an immediate hearing seeking a remand to the
State court which had reached final judgment, to remand it
back to the State trial court.
See here, for example, the entire history of the
State court proceedings is recited in the trial brief and the
copy of the supporting papers thereto filed an appendi:-? to
the trial brief.

See also the "lis pendens” arguments made

to the Court .in the trial brief at pages 13 and

14 and 22,

and in the oral argument in the transcript at pages 33 and
34.

The argument about "lis pendens" completely went over

the head of the Federal District Court.

It paid no attention

to it.
Those matters, however, do not appear in the Court's
opinion and it is as to these matters that I would now like
to direct this Court's attention.
Passing on to the action that was filed, this
matter began two years ago, September 18, 1972, with the
prosecuting attorney of Allen County,, Ohio filing an action
in the Common Please Court against Dakota and everyone who
had any kind of interest in that property, the real property
owners, the known lessee, anyone that could possibly be
identified as holding a recorded interest.
In his allegations, he stated

that the Cinema One

Theater which was being operated on that real property was

14
engaged in violation of the nubile nuisance statute and was
showing obscene films.
At paragraph 7, he alleged that for a period of
10 weeks the Cinema One Theater had consistently shown obscene
pictures and then recited in detail, not as in the application
for a search warrant at Lee Arts Theater of Richmond, Virginia
where they just said we have seen an obscene film and this is
it and. we want to pick it

up.

He said. "These are the films

that were shown#" "This is the period they were shown’' and
"This is what■» they show".

He described in detail what the

films were and, in addition# In the same paragraph he
incorporated by reference time-motion studies of approximately
10,000 photographs# which made a time-motion, analysis of what
was depicted in those films.
He went on to allege' at paragraph 10 that the
exhibition of said motion picture films at

the Cinema 1

hereinabove alleged constitutes a public nuisance as described
in the public nuisance statute

in the State of Ohio.

He then went on further to say that for the following
reason and explained what depictions were in violation, what
specific depictions were in violation of the State statute.
And those are recited in detail at pages — see pages 012
through 013 of the Appendix.
Now, having stated what the films were, having
shown pictorially what they were, having described the acts

which were container! therein which were in violation of the
State law, hen then ashed for the following prayers

That

the nuisance be forthwith abated by Order of the Court and
that the defendants, and all of them, and all persons acting
by or through them be restrained from exhibiting said motion
picture films in the State of Ohio,
At the same time, having filed a civil action, he
asked for a provisional remedy which is allowed under the
statute and that is a motion for a preliminary injunction.
If filed, the hearing must be had within 10 days and upon
5 days’ notice.
He did file the motion for a preliminary injunction
and the matter did come up for hearing, at which time the
Court viewed four films which had been under subpoena.

The

Court viewed the entire four films and, on October 24th,
issued, and this was in an adversary hearing in which the
defense counsel appeared and responded and provided •
and offered their defense.

—

The Court issued ~~ filed its

order on October 24th in which he said the nuisance does
exist, as alleged, by the prosecutor.

He then ordered the

Cinema I theater closed forthwith for any purpose of lewdness,
to wit the projection or screening of lewd, indecent,
liscivious or obscene films.
But, in addition, haviriq closed it temporarily,
he said, "The Court orders that the Defendant show cause, if

any they can*- why this closing Order should not be made as of
this date* having found that a public nuisance did exist after
a trial on the merits, the Court under the statute was
required to — the Defendants were required to come forward
and show that the nuisance had been abated or give bond.

The

Order on October 24th to the Defendants was to come forward
and show either that the nuisance has been abated or give bond,
or come forward with some other remedy you may have under the
statute.
Instead* the Defendants marched over to the Federal
Court

and filed an action William Dakota v.

Fair & Oarlock,

the investigators involved in which they pleaded the complaint
itself.

They set before the Federal District Court a complete

recitation of what was involved in the State court proceeding.
The Federal District Court knew exactly what was in the State
Court.
QUESTION:

Does the Federal District. Court in this

case sit in Lima or did he have to go to Toledo?
MR. CLANCY:
QUESTION:

Toledo* Your Honor.
But in the Allen County proceedings,

the State proceeding was in Lima?
MR. CLANCY:

Yes* Your Honor.

In this action a hearing was held before —■ correction
the matter came up and out of that hearing an Order was
issued by Judge Walinski interfering with the preliminary

injunction which

'.was issued by the State Court and he

ordered that the State injunction be stayed: insofar as it
affected showing films which had not been held to be obscene
in a prior adversary hearing.

So he said, "You can't

padlock it."
So at that point the prosecutor went in and filed
a motion arid he said — he brought before the Court two
other films, "Sexual Freedom Now" and "Shootout’at Beaver
Halls", and started another proceedings, forgetting all about
the preliminary injunction.
At the end of other adversary hearings in which
the defense counsel was present, and after presentation of
evidence on 12 additional films, the Court entered its final
injunction

on November the 30th, finding the allegations

of the Plaintiff’s complaint, verified complaint showed and
finding that he had engaged in a course of conduct of dis­
playing mo<ion picture films at the Cinema I Theater
which were obscene, and that the course of conduct and the
continuing exhibition of the films constituted a nuisance
under the statute, he permanently enjoined and restrained
them from conducting the said nuisance, and he continued to
pay no attention to what the Federal Court, did, he continued
his Order with padlocking.
Thereupon, having filed the final Order, the
Defendants could have taken appeal, but, now, they left.

18
that, matter stand and they went back into the Federal Court
this time with a different defendant, Pursue, Ltd. saying
that Pursue, Ltd. is a new assignee.

He purchased his

interest on November 17th while this matter was entrain and.
now he wants to litigate the same thing over.
Thereafter, Mr. Huffman, in a series of moves in
which he moved for a further relief, he was completely
frustrated either that having filed on December 1st, the
Court issued a temporary restraining order, once again
nullifying the padlock provision.
Following that then, the prosecutor went back again
in the State Court and started hearings again.

What did

defense counsel do but he removed the case entirely to the
Federal Court again so the State Court couldn't do anything.
QUESTION:
MR. CLANCY:

Was there a motion to remand made?
There xtfere two. not one, but two.

Under the Federal Court Order restricting the

stay action, they continued to show the pornographic films
and took time-motion studies and brought them before the
Federal Court and said, "Here is what they’re showing under
the cover of your Order."

And still nothing was done about

it.
QUESTION:

It may appear somewhere in this record,

voluminous as it is, but I have missed it, does the State’s
Attorney General figure in these proceedings or is each
county or district autonymous?
MR. CLANCY:

He took no part, Your Honor.

He is

required to — they are required to name him under the
attack on the statute, but he took no active part, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

Under the statute, the prosecuting

attorney can initiate the action, or any private citizen?
MR, CLANCY:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor,
But not the State Attorney General,

except insofar as he may be a private citizen?
MR. CLANCY:

The prosecuting attorney is in control) Yes, sir.

Well, Justice, this Honorable Court, the history of
this Lima action which I have just recounted on September 18,
1972, over two years ago, those matters are not yet resolved.
And this is not an exceptional case.

It is a modus operandi

for defense attorneys all around the country.

There's carbon

copies for this in every State in the Union, really.

And I

know from personal example that the State of California and
the County of Los Angeles is in a similar mess and this Court
has just noted jurisdiction in a similar case Hicks v. Miranda.
s

Now, the jurisdiction on that case would not begin
to recount the events which are occurring in the Federal
District Court there.
peripheral matters.

That is simply a limited question on
I think, as I said before, this is not

21
an exceptional case and X think it is, in the sense the
prosecutors here have stayed with it, Mr. Huffman and
Mr, Herman have really stayed with it doggedly through all of
the Federal interference and have pushed it along as they
have.
In my opinion, they do not. — they should not be
treated as they have in the Federal Court as, for example,
being brought before that Court on an Order to Show Cause
why they should not be held in contempt when, following this
Court’s decision in June of 1973, and the failure of this
Court to give them extraordinary relief, they came back and
they said to the Court, they filed another action, and
attempted once again, they were stopped immediately in the
Order to Show Cause why they should not be held in contempt.
It seems unbelievable to me that such a result should be
obtained under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 when this Court
in 1850, just 21 years before the Civil Rights Act was
adopted, said in Phelan v. Commonwealth, "The suppression of
nuisances injurious to public health or morality is amongr
the most important duties of Government.

It is a principle

of the Common Law that the King cannot sanction a nuisance.
The atoptic evidence which was before the court below on the
motion to dismiss the complaint as a sham pleading, efc cetera,
brought to the Federal District Court clear knowledge of what
was involved in the Allen County Common Please Court.

22
And it seems to ms ? if this condition is to prevail?
then it must be concluded that the Federal system of justice
is underwriting? to put it crudely and hlimfcly? cock-sucking
and whoreraongering which? to me? is completely in violation of
my thinking about American way of life and American justice.
Now? that's the first time I have ever used those words in my
entire life, and yet I think it is appropriate that I use them
now so that this Court understands what is occurring in the
Federal Court system.

I say the majority of this Court, does

not want this to come about.

QUESTION:

Mr. Clancy? I don’t think I heard you

mention the case of Younger against Harris,

Do you think

that5 s—
MR. CLANCY:

No? Your Honor? I think it should be

decided on the matter of the "res." exception, which is a
jurisdictional matter.

As I understand it? Younger v„ Harris

has to do with we have jurisdiction? but you are not to
exercise it; that is? the case is properly before the Federal
Court

— I am saying that it is not properly in that Court.

*3

There is no power.

In Donovan v. Dallas, this Court so

held that the power of the State Court — when it is in the
Federal Court the State Court has no power to act in that
case.

Similarly, in Orton v. Smith, they said when the

State Court has it, the Federal Court has no power.

The net

effect of this will he to permit the prosecutors to taka this
in the State Court

and take it up through the United States

without interference.

if it is going to be whipped.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GILBERT H. DEITCH, F.SQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

MR. DEITCH:

t

Mr. Chief Justice, may it. please the

Court;
First of all, firstly, Mr. Justice Stewart, the
Attorney General of the State can bring the action to abate
a nuisance under .03 of this statutory scheme.

Either the

24
Attorney General of the State, the prosecuting attorney or
private citizen.
QUESTIONt

Ordinarily, is it true in Ohio as it is

in most States that the Attorney General leaves it to the
local prosecution?
MR. DEITCH:

Honestly, Mr. Chief Justice, 3'. being

a Georgia lawyer and not an Ohio lawyer, I don’t know, but
on advice of Ohio counsel, that is the case.
Briefly, with regard to this action, Mr. Huffman,
as prosecuting attorney, filed a suit to close Cinema I
Theater in Lima, Ohio under the 3767.01 and following statutes.
Interesting to note, it is interesting to note that
under the Ohio scheme a tenant, a pure tenant, has no right
once a temporary injunction is issued to abate.
to get a bond.

lias no right

Only one, the real property owner or, two,

a Personal property ovTner.

So, if Pursue, Ltd. or United

Artists has a right only to cio business within the theater,
once a temporary injunction is issued, that entity is fore­
closed pending final decision.
This is exactly what happened in the State action.
Once there was a hearing; a temporary injunction issued,
Mr. Dakota went into Federal Court because he had no relief
in State Court,
QUESTION:

Well, don’t you have a right to appeal

from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas granting the

injunction to the Ohio Court of Appeals?
MR. DEITCH:

Not a temporary injunction, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Not a temporary injunction?

MR. DEITCH:

No, sir.

And according to I think it

is Z-22 of the Appendix, there was a motion made by
Mr, Dakota’s counsel to stay the order, the temporary injunc
ion, which was denied.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, you can apply to an

Appellate Court for a stay and it can be denied.,, but that
doesn’t mean you don’t have a right to appeal even if the
Appellate Court won’t grant you a stay.
MR. DEITCH:

The Supreme Court of Ohio in 1973,

in State ex rel Ewing v. "Without a Stitch’1, said that it
was error for the trial judge to allow a motion picture to
continue to show pending — after a temporary injunction,
pending appeal.
So if a rationale is carried to a whole •— to the
establishment, then it is error to allow the establishment
to stay open or to grant a 3tay pending final determination.
QUESTION:

That doesn't go to my brother Rehnquist

question as to the right of appeal, does it?
MR. DEITCH:

It is my understanding of Ohio law

that there is no right of appeal at this stage of the
proceedings,

26

QUEST I OH i

it would he one of the very , very few

jurisdictions I have aver heard of where after a temporary
injunction was issued on a. hearing, you didn't have a right
to appeal»

I don't claim to know Ohio procedure.
QUESTION:

Well, I passed the Ohio Bar exam once

and unless the lav? is changed, that was my impression that
there was a right of appeal.
MR. DF.1TCII:

At this point in time, when the Federal

lawsuit was filed, it was — there were theaters which had
been closed, I think it was a case of first impression of the
Allen County Court of Appeals, the appeals court sitting in
that county, and it is purely discretionary with that Court
whether to grant a stay of the trial court's order" or not.
QUESTION:

Well, that means that we have an Ohio

case involving Ohio statutory or Ohio procedure with a
California lawyer on one side and a Georgia one on the other.
MR. DEITCK:
Black.

Well, let me explain this, Mr. Justice

Mr. Dakota was not represented by myself.

Mr. Dakota,

in November, transferred his right to do business to my client,
Pursue, Ltd.
QUESTION:

Well, frankly, I would like to know

whether under the Ohio procedure there is a right of appeal
here.

And all you are able to say, according to your

understanding, there is none.
that question?

Nov?, what is the answer* to

27
QUESTION:

Very simply, we’ll have to look it up.

MR. DEITCH;

Or I will provide to the Court an

interpretation -—
QUESTIONv

It was your position that—

MR. DEITCH;

Legislatively or judicially.

QUESTION;—wran you have an abatement of a
nuisance there is no right of appeal.
MR. DEITCH:
QUESTION:

That’s what you said.

Yes, sir.
Well, nov;, the "Without a Stitch" Case

did go all the way to the Supreme Court.

It had to get there

somehow.
MR. DEITCH:
QUESTION:

Permanent injunction, yes, sir.
That’s' your permanent injunction?

MR. DEITCH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
If I am not mistaken, we have another
•

petition for certiorari

pending here.

'i

Maybe it’s that

case from the Ohio Supreme Court involving this same nuisance
statute.
MR. DEITCH:

Possibly, but its position with regard

to Younger v. Harris, which Your Honor has been inquiring
of Mr. Clancy,

it is the position of the appellee in this

case that now Younger will not apply notwithstanding whether
it’s a quasi-criminal activity or civil activity, the Ohio
Supreme Court has held this very statutory scheme to foe
constitutional, based, as Mr. Clancy said, would cause trouble

d, 8

on one motion picture.

And it said that if that motion,

picture is shown to be obscene the Court shall issue a
temporary and then shall issue a permanent injunction, closing
the theater, selling the assets and permanently, wall, for one
year closing the premises down.

Upon temporary and permanent

injunction, or permanent injunction, the real estate, the
real property owner or personal property owners can come in
and, at the discretion of the trial court, they can be
released of the lease or thepersonal property, such as a pop­
corn machine or book racks, or whatever, if it’s a bookstore
or a theater.
Wow, with regard .to the state of proceedings when
this civil case was filed against Mr. Dakota by the prosecuting
attorney, once the temporary injunction was filed, his counsel,
based upon the fact that he had no standing as purely
licensee or lessee to seek

a bond from the trial court, he

did ask for a stay, which was denied, and the question of
appeal at that point is, I will admit, open.

However, at that

point in time his attorney had to make a choice what do 1 do
now to keep this padlock provision from coming into play.
So he went to Judge Walinski, he went to Toledo and,
Mr, Justice Rehnquist, I have made the trip. It is about an
(sic)
hour by car. The District judge, upon a. 1993 action did not
stay or enjoin, any criminal prosecution.

He did not enjoin

or stay the injunction against certain motion picture films.

23

He merely said that as far as the closing of a theater,
I’m going to stay that portion of the injunction until —
I'll consider abstention

this is in his Order — until the

trial court has a final hearing and looks at this case in
light of Hear v. Minnesota.
prosecute.

So the State was free to

The State was free to file contempt charges

for showing certain motion pictures at that point in time.
This is October 26th, Judge Walinski issued this Order.
QUESTION:

Mr. Deitch, at what phase the court

enforce its temporary injunction?
MR. DEITCH:
it did.

Hot to padlock the theater, which

The sheriff of Allen County went out and put a pad­

lock on the doors and when Judge Walinski's order was
issued, they were taken off and the motion picture theater
continued to do business under the stay.
QUESTION:

Thereafter—

You say the State was free to bring

contempt charges?
MR. DEITCH:

For certain motion pictures which

had been found to be obscene by the trial court — the
State trial court.
QUESTION:

I thought the injunction was against

further stayed action.
MR. DEITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:

No, sir, it was against—
Padlock—
—the closure, purely the padlock—

30

QUESTION*

--the continued padlock.

MR. DEITCH:

No, once Judge Walinski4s Order was

issued, the padlock was taken off.
QUESTION:

Well, if the padlock is taken off, how

can you get contempt?
MR. DEITCH:

Well, as Judge Walinski said, this does

in effect, an injunction against Exhibits A through % or
Exhibit 1 through 45, which the trial court found to be
obscene? only against those movies which had not been adjudicated
to be obscene.
QUESTION:

And that’s final now, isn’t it?

MR. DEITCH:

Well, after Judge Walinski issued

this Order—
QUESTION:

With that, this Federal Court Order,that

injunction is final.
MR, DEITCH:

No, that was a temporary injunction

at that point in time.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCHs

Had they had a hearing since then?
Yes, sir, once Judge Walinski issued

his Order, then—
QUESTION:
in force?

How long was the temporary injunction

No use in ms asking.

I was going to ask how long

is a temporary injunction valid.
•MR. DEITCH:
on December-

The temporary injunction was issued

3.1

QUESTION;

How long is it valid in Ohio?

MR. .DEITCH:

Until the final hearing on the •

permanent injunction.
QUESTION;
MR. DEITCIIs

It will last forever?
Well, the statutory scheme says this

case — you don’t have to bring it on within 10 days or
15 days.

It merely has priority over all cases except

criminal cases and a few other cases.
QUESTION:

So it is still in effect except for the

Pederal Court Order?
MR. DE'ITCH:

Well, it was still in effect at that

time except for the padlocking.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:

How about now?
Well,since that time, the matter came

on for permanent injunction.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:

That's what I thought.
But before the permanent injunction,

Mr. Dakota transferred the lease to Pursue, Ltd.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCK:

Yes.
And then at the permanent injunction

hearing, Judge Like (phonetic) notwithstanding Judge Walinski's
Order, issued a permanent injunction closing the theater
for one year and ordering the $300.00 taxation—
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:

How does that stand now?
So after that permanent, injunction,

Pursue, Ltd. went bach into Federal Court, as party plaintiff,
and sued Mr. Ifciffraen and noticed the Attorney General, nor.
nasaihg him

33

a party defendant, and asked for declaratory

relief, an .injunction not against prosecution, but only, against
the padlock provisions of 3767.01 et seg

And the three-judge

court declared, only 3767.04 and .06 to be unconstitutional.
That is the padlock provision.

And it left open an injunction

against a named motion picture which could be brought by
Mr. Huffman enjoining the showing of a named motion picture
upon proof.' • And it didn't affect any criminal prosecution
whatsoever.

It is our position that under this statutory

scheme it says, it follows a civil procedure, and at sub­
section 11, the legislative enactment says that these pro­
cedures can come into play after a criminal prosecution.

So

that if one motion picture film is — an individual is
indicted for showing a motion picture film and convicted,
then the entire theater can be closed.
QUESTION:

hTnere is this statute?

I didn't find it

in the Appellant’s brief, which is where it ought to be.
MR. DEITCH:

QUESTION*

Thank you.

QUESTION:

After the permanent injunction, before —

after that the case was started in the Federal District
Court o

There might have been an appeal where, in the Court

of Appeals of Ohio?
MR. DEITCH:

Yes, sir, there could have been an

appeal from the permanent injunction.
QUESTION:

However—

There could have been and that, was not

taken, I take it?
MR. DEITCH:

No, because when Mr. Dakota filed

his suit, when he was the tenant, the Court issued the
injunction for temporary restraining order and then once the
permanent injunction came down, Pursue adopted, in our
complaint, the allegations and we are said to be bound by
a "lis pendens"— and we assume the same position—
QUESTION:

Could Pursue, at that juncture, after

the permanent injunction have appealed the permanent
injunction to the Ohio Court of Appeals?
MR. DEITCH:

It could — wellit wasn't a named

defendant, merely served with papers.by the sheriff.

It was

not named as a party defendant in a State action.
QUESTION:

Well, who could have appealed the

permanent injunction?
MR.DEITCH:

If you could go into the Federal Court, as you dicl,

why couldn't you have taken an appeal from the injunction?

QUESTION:

Does that raise a Younger

QUESTION:

Sure.

question?

MR. DEITCH: I believe that Younger is not applicable
because this is purely a civil proceeding and this Court
left the question open in Younger.
QUESTION:

Haven’t all of these issues that you’ve

raised in the Federal Court, already been decided in the State

35
Court?

Why should you have an opportunity to relitigate

them in the Federal Court?
HR. DEITCII:

Well# the matter — as Dakota was

already in the Federal Court, he chose his forum where to
be heard.

He could have filed

a certain declaratory judgment

in the State Court.
QUESTION:

Well, but quite apart from his filing

in a suit, weren't these issues litigated in a nuisance
proceeding?

Didn’t you raise these defenses there?

MR. DEITCHs

No, not Pursue, Ltd. because I, as

counsel for Pursue, appeared at the permanent injunction
hearing and Judge Light asked me if I was a member—
QUESTION:

Let's assume the property hadn’t changed

hands just for a moment.
MR. DEITCH; Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Wasn't there a final judgment in the

District Court?
MR. DEITCHj

But the Federal litigation

had been

commenced before final judgment.
QUESTION: I know, but what’s the rule1, on res
judicata?1

T^e State proceeding in the State, nuisance action

finished before the Federal action did?
MR. DEITCH:

No, sir, the Federal action was

started before the permanent injunction.
QUESTION:

But wasn’t concluded.

36

MR. DEITCH:

No, there was a temporary restraining

order„
QUESTION:

Well, if there are two suits going on at

the same time, covering the same issues, the one that finishes
first normally becomes res judicata of the other..,

will say, you’re going up—■

Exactly.

QUESTION:

Did Huffman interpose' e defense to the

Federal suit res judicata?
MS. DEITCH:
QUESTION:

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.
Well, I suppose that’s the answer to the

res judicata question, isn’t it?

That's a defense, isn’t

it, that he would have had to interpose—
MR, DEITCH:

I do not believe he raised that as a

defense in Federal Court.
QUESTION:

If he didn't, I suppose that’s out of

the case, but that doesn't take the Younger question out,
does it?
MR. DEITCH:

It is our position there is a Younger

QUESTION:

Your position is that the "Younger

That's correct.
And not to this civil.

And if the Court—
And as I understand it, this civil, if

that’s what it is—
MR. DEITCH:

Yes, sir.
—proceeding is in aid of a possible

criminal prosecution, isn’t it?
MR, DEITCH:

No, that’s separate and distinct

from a criminal prosecution.
QUESTION: Not an aid of—
MR. DEITCH:

Well, it refers in the last sub-

\
section that this is a separate procedure from criminal
procedures.

It is our position that if the Court says,

this is a "criminal proceeding", then fcha exceptions, we would
submit under Younger v. Harris are there? that is the
great and immediate irreperable harm.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:
QUESTION:

First Amendment argument?
Yes, sir, the closing of the theater.
To what extent was that tried out — was

the content of these films tried out in the State courts?
MR. DEITCH:

The content of the films was at this

point in time, at the filing of Mr. Dakota's complaint, the

3S
filing of Pursue1s complaint to final judgment by the
Federal Court on April 20t'n, 1972, the only procedures, to my
knowledge, against the defendants in the State action was a
civil proceeding,.
QUESTION:

Did they try out the issue of

obscenity of the films?
MR. DEITCH:

The judge, sitting without a jury, did

say these films presented to me are obscene.
QUESTION:
MR. DEITCH:

And that’s his final judgment?
That was his judgment,

/tow the question

is allowing the State to go through the civil proceeding, one,
changes the burden of proof and, two, disallows the defendants
in the State action a right to a jury ferial.

And this Court

has said part of the test of obscenity to be the contemporary
community standard.

So at least this should allow — that

should not be allowed with regard to this case, for a judge to
say, to rubber stamp, this is obscene-, this is obscene, this
is obscene.

We

should have a right to a jury trial.

QUESTION:

Would you read the community standard

language in the various obscenity opinions of this Court
as mandating a jury trial in a civil proceeding where the
State doesn’t choose to provide one?
MR. DEITCH:

I'm saying that to allow

the State

Court to padlock an establishment based upon one judge's—
QUESTION:

Are you going to answer my question?

39
MR. DEITCH:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, would you please repeat it?
QUESTION:

Do you read the community standard

language of the various opinions of this Court dealing with
obscenity as mandating a jury trial in a civil proceeding
where the State doesn't choose to provide one?
MR. DEITCH:

No, sir.

But I'm saying that at least

the members of the community should have the opportunity to
pass upon the motion pictures.
QUESTION:

They have indirectly, as Mr. Justice

Rehnquist suggested, by the State Legislature having vested
the powers to decide that factual issue in a single judge
instead of a jury of six or twelve people.
MR. DEITCK:

And a single judge for the motion

pictures presented to him. But than you get to the question
of the over-breath of the statutory scheme and his Order,
closing in future, in future, the shov/ing of any motion
picture.
QUESTION:

Well, I know some have argued that the

First Amendment requires a jury trial.

You can't say

in a sole proceeding the Seventh Amendment because the
Seventh Amendment has never been extended, to the States.
But there have been some who have argued that because of the
First Amendment overtones of the obscenity field, that there
is a constitutional First Amendment requirement of a jury

40
trial.

This Court has naver said that, has it?
MR. DEITCH3

I don't believe so.

Now, with regard to Younger v. Barris, I would like
to reiterate that the State Court of Ohio, the state
Supreme Court in Syllabus 4 of State er re3. Ewing v. "Without

Mr. Justice Powell.

Wasn't there an original State injunction

?md with regard to annealing the matter

through the State channels, it could be argued by the State
that if the dockets being heavy the matter may take more than
a year to reach final resolution and become moot.
QUESTION:

You didn’t go to the Supreme Court of

Ohio with this case because the result was a foregone con­
clusion after the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision in
"Without a Stitch"?
MR. DEITCH:

No, at the time this permanent

injunction was issued, we felt that to go into Federal Court
because the Supreme Court of Ohio in an earlier case in 1971
had said the motion picture film can be enjoined and the
nuisance provisions under these schemes can be invoked.

decision that you went into the Federal forum instead of

MR. DEITCII:

That was part of the rationale.

And

once the temporary or opinion anti order of Judge Walinski

I don't believe Pursue is operating
I believe the corporation still

QUESTION:

Is there anybody operating the theater

now?
MR. DEITCH:

I think the theater is in operation.

There is one other theater in Lima and if the argument is
the corporation can go elsewhere and shox* the movies, that
theater was well-engaged, I belive, "Last Tango in Paris”.
So we would be precluded.

There’s but one other walk-in

theater in the town of Lima, Ohio.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. CLANCY
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
HR. CLANCY:

Yes, Your Honor,,

something clear about how this
and read now from

C-5.

I would like to make

preliminary injunction issues

I think the Court has a misconception

of what happens.
It ssys here if at the time of granting a temporary
injunction, it further appears that the person owning, in control,
or in charge of the nuisance so enjoined had received five days'
notice of the hearing and unless such person shows to the
satisfaction of the court or judge that the nuisance complained
of is abated, then he issues the injunction.

But at thee

time he finds that; is a public nuisance exists, the defendant
can abate, say, "I have abated it.
In the case of "Without a Stitch"

I am withdrawing the film".
the defendant there

notwithstanding the trial judge finding it was an obscene
film continued to show it and the court said no you can’t
do it.

So I suggest that, under the circumstances in this

case, had the defendants come forward and said, "We're
going to stop showing these pornographic films", they would
not have been foreclosed because they would have shown — at
least they could have told or given some evidence to the judge
that the public nuisance complained of had been abated.
/

The Ohio Supreme Court has said that if the
defendant comes forward and does not show "Without a Stitch"

50

then that nuisance has been abated and the place cannot be
padlocked.

But it said that if there is a finding by the

trial judge that a public nuisance does exist, then he must
padlock it.
Now there has been at least three cases filed in
the Toledo area, one is ''Dean Throat1' and the other is
"Stewardesses" and the other is "Without a Stitch**.

All

three of those have gone through the system and the theater
is still in operation, notwithstanding the fact that the Order
stands that it must be abated.

Justice Stex^art was asking whether or not

other side, he says that going up through the State court
system gives him insufficient remedy, assuming he has a good
First Amendment claim because the State of Ohio Supreme
Court has held that under this statute it is error for the
trial court to promote the continued showing of the movie

And that was held in this ”Without a Stitch'1

case.
MR. CLANCY:

I am saying there is no right to show

And pending an appeal from that finding,

the Supreme Court of Ohio says it is error under this statute
to grant any sort of a stay and to permit, the continued
showing of the film.
