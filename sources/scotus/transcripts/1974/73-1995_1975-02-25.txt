ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL IUNGERICH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. IUNGERICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
This case is a federal habeas corpus action
brought by a ward of the California Youth Authority who is
currently in custody on parole.
It presents an important question under the
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied
to the states through the

Due Process Clause of the 14th

Amendment and this question is whether a juvenile such as
Respondent Jones, is placed twice in jeopardy when the
Juvenile Court orders his trial as an adult after an
adjudication of delinquency and upon a finding that he is
\

unfit for treatment as a juvenile.
The facts in this case are not in dispute.
In a petition filed in the Los Angeles County
Superior Court, Respondent Jones was charged with the
commission of an act which, if committed by an adult, would
have constituted a robbery under California law.

4
In a jurisdictional or adjudicatory hearing on this
petition. Respondent Jones was found to have committed the
robbery alleged, in that petition.
We submit, as far as this case is concerned, to the
Court that we treat this particular proceeding as a trial
and I don't think there Is any question of our agreement
between 'the parties on that point that the jurisdictional
or adjudicatory hearing is, In every sense, a court trial.
After this adjudicatory or jurictional hearing, a
second hearing was held, known as a dispositional hearing
and at chis hearing the juvenile court had what amounts to
four choices under California law.
He could place the juvenile on probation.
He could commit the juvenile to a juvenile
institution within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court —
in other words, a county camp for juveniles or one of the
other county facilities available to juvenile's.
He could order a commitment to the California
Youth Authority or he could do what he did in this case,
exercise his power under Welfare and Institutions Code
Section (Of and that Is, transfer the case to the adult court
for trial of the juvenile as an adult.
QUESTION:

These four alternatives were entirely

within his discretion, were they?
fiR, IUNGER1CH:

All four alternatives are within his

discretion under California law although they occur in
separate divisions of the code — of the Welfare and
Institutions Code.
QUESTION:

What is the age limit, 18 in California?

MR. IUNGERICH:
Honor.

It is 18 at this time, yes, your

The age was 21 at the time the statute was amended,

subsequent to this particular juvenile's transfer.
He was 17 at the time of his transfer.
QUESTION:

And If he chose the alternative of

Incarceration, how long could he imprison hijri, up until
what age?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, I believe up until age 26,
\

depending on whether or not there is ultimately a proceeding
under the — if he was committed to the Youth Authority and
he was — ultimately came back at age 21 and it was found
that he still constituted a danger to s®ciety, under the
particular sections involved in the Youth Authority, he could
technically be committed up until age 26, I believe, at that
time.
QUESTION :

What kind of hearing is the transfer

hearing?
MR. IUNGERICH:
hearing?

What type of hearing Is the transfer

Well, basically, I think that transfer hearing

is set out in the case of Jimmy H«

In other words, there

are a number of factors to be considered.

6
The first factor, of course, the factor that is
expressly included, is just taking a look at the gravity of
the offense alone.

The California statute expressly provides

that that alone is not enough for transfer.
What the judge will look at are three factors under
the Jimmy H. case and those three factors are, first, you
take a look at the circumstances of the offense that is
involved and the circumstances of the offense — the circum­
stances that surround the offense in the particular case.
He also takes a look at the juvenile prior conduct,
in other words, any of his behavior

patterns whether or not,

as in this case, he has committed prior crimes, again within
the Juvenile Court jurisdiction.
In this case, Respondent Jones had committed two
prior armed robberies.
♦ *

QUESTION:

Is this an adversary proceeding?

IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

'Yes, it is, your Honor.

Examination and cross-examination of

witnesses ?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes, your Honor.

It is provided in all the California Juvenile Court
proceedings and of course, that is — the mandate, of course,
as we would read the combination of Gault and Kent -- in
a ..cation to looking at the particular circumstances of the
case, of course, he is going to look at the minor's degree of

7
sophistication would be the third factor

and the extent of

his criminal Involvement in this particular case.
QUESTION:

Are there findings in support of the

order of transfer?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Are the findings here?

Are there findings?

In these transfer proceedings?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, the findings are not normally

formally made.
In other words, In the sense of findings of fact
and conclusions of law such as you have in a motion for
summary judgment.

Basically the report, probation report

j-.f. it is held at the end of the transfer hearing, as in this
case, is before the judge.
He has the testimony and at that point he makes his
decision and he may state the factors that guide him as far
as transfer.
I doubt that there is any express requirement in

California law that all of those

factors be placed on the

record at the present time.
QUESTION:

How about in this case?

Were there

findings?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well; I think it is quite clear in

wars case, as far as the disposition hearing, the findings
were — the primary reason that he felt that this
man should

8
be transferred —
QUESTION:

Should be tried as an adult.

MR. IUNGERICH:

— was the fact that he had committed

two other armed robberies, that he had been committed to
juvenile institutions in both of those cases and that,
basically, he wasnst amenable to the Juvenile Court process
for that reason.
I think it is a clear case of non-amenability as —
under any standard that would be applied in that type of
hearing."
QUESTION:

I take it, if there were a dispute of

fact, of one of these important elements, there would be a
finding?
MR. IUNGERICH:

If there was a dispute of fact?

I

would assume that the judge would state his reasons why he
was finding one way or another but under the California
rules, as this would come up on appeal, of course, if there
was evidence in the record that would support the ultimate
result the judge reached, then, of course, those Implied
findings would be what the California court would rely on
in that situation.
I think, though, that basically the point that you
have brought out here Is one that I think is very important as
j.s.i”

as considering the nature of the Questions involved here.
Basically, what’ double jeopardy means in this

9
particular context, in this particular case is, that a
hearing is foreclosed at any point except prior to the
adjudicatory hearing on the question of transfer and the
question that really — the double jeopardy issue really is
determinative of is whether

or not the state should be

permitted the flexibility to have the hearing either before
or after and I think arguments could be made for a preferential -- for preference one way or another depending upon
the individual case.
I submit that where you have a serious felony,
as robbery or murder or rape, you have a likelihood of a
contest of facts and

although technically we are not

considering guilt or innocence at the transfer hearing,
nevertheless, the judge is going to want to know the facts
involved in this.

The questions need to go into the same

questions of fact that would be involved here.
QUESTION:

Is it a combination of those two

inquiries in one proceeding?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

What ?

Is there ever a combination of those

inquiries in one proceeding?

That is, a determination of

the offense and a determination of the findings?
MR. IUNGERICH:

No, that has been expressly ruled

out, that you can’t make the determination in one pro­
ceedings.

What we do is, we save the possibilities of having

10

three proceedings and we only have two, If we permit the
alternative, the dispositional alternative of allowing
transfer after trial.
Basically, what you have if you don't have the
dispositional alternative after trial — the advantage of
the dispositional alternatives, if there are contested issues
as to the minor's Involvement in the crime, as to the circum­
stances surrounding his involvement in the crime, those
usually would be brought before the judge at the adjudicatory
hearing and he can rely on what he learned at the adjudicatory
hearing to shorten the process irtien it comes before him on
disposition, whereas if you hold this hearing before, you may
have actually cwo duplicate trials, both of which, covering
the same subject matter and, as it is conceded by all parties
in this ease, as we agree, it would, in that situation, if you
hold it

prior, you will require two judges.
Because the judge that is considering the information

that comes in in the social study, which is the equivalent of
the probation report that a criminal judge would receive at
sentencing, he would have many of the hearsay materials that
are presented in the probation report that might Influence
him on the question of sentencing and it felt that he should
not then preside on the issue of guilt or innocence, having
heard that matter.
QUESTION:

So you would have to have two judges.
And I take it, at that dispositional

11
hearing, the disposition is to turn him over to the Youth
Authority.

That, in effect, is as if it were a sentence,

is it?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes, it is --- in the sense, I

would say that that would be much — it would be tantamount
to the sentence in a criminal proceeding.
In other words, If he were committed to the Youth
Authority or he were sent to a juvenile institution.
We didn't have that in this case and I think that —
that is the important factor that Indicates why we don’t have
a proper application or a proper case of the application
of the principle of double jeopardy in this case.
QUESTION:

Is there a Supreme Court of California

opinion concluding that this procedure Is not a violation
of che California constitutional provision against double
jeopardy?
Mo. IUNGERICH:
the position.

Yes, I think quite clearly that Is

The California Court — I don't recall whether

^^gllJ!l£susJ3uperipr Court, which is the leading case —
Gr-yan held that there is no violation of double jeopardy to
aHow this transfer to take place after the adjudicatory
hearing and Bryan is cited in our brief.
I do not recall whether Bryan, went off on
California grounds and I don't think they did discuss the
California Constitution, although that option was available

12

to the Court in applying — in deciding the constitutional
question before it.
But, basically, the rule in California today is
that the hearing may be held either before or after and
double jeopardy really comes down to the question, must it be
limited only before, under the constitutional compulsion of
the .Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the
14th Amendment?
I submit that that question — the resolution of
that question is, Really turns on the fact that although
Respondent Gary Steven Jones was tried twice in this particu­
lar case -- and I submit that the submission on the preliminary
transcript of the adult case, he was in effect, tried twice
and that is the equivalent of a trial under California laxtf

because

the judge determined all the issues of. fact based on

Hhe preliminary transfer.
Nevertheless, although he was tried twice, he was
not placed in jeopardy twice and I think the critical
distinction here is, what is the — the critical question is,
/

what is a Jeopardy for the purposes of the case?
Because even if jeopardy had attached at the point
Qi transfer and even if double jeopardy applied in the extent
oi saying that jeopardy does attach in the juvenile court.
Respondent Jones was not placed twice in jeopardy under the
circumstances of this case for the primary reason, first, that

13
none of the policies behind — none of the protections that
are incorporated in the double jeopardy position were vio­
lated in this case.
In North Carolina versus Pearce, those protections
were set out.

The first was that double jeopardy protects

against a second prosecution after acquittal and, of course,
I think assumed in that ground is also what is tantamount to
acquittal, a dismissal at some point prior to acquittal
where there isn't manifest necessity for the dismissal
in the determination of the case.
In this case, there was no acquittal.

There was

nothing tantamount. If anything, what we had here was some­
thing that was tantamount to a. conviction without a sentence
and there has never been a situation where the Court has
held that where there actually has not been determination
proceedings that there was actually a jeopardy — a first
jeopardy at that point and the commencement of a second
jeopardy where you have some sort of a continuance.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't dispute, would you, that if

tne juvenile judge dismissed the charges after this hearing
and found them, in effect, not guilty, that then he couldn't
be tried as an adult on the same charges?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, under California law, of

course, under Richard M, versus Superior Court, we are
bound under our state law by that principle.

In other words, that there jeopardy would attach
and that you couldn't retry him if it had been dismissed
after the adjudicatory hearing had commenced.
QUESTION:

And did your Court put that on the basis

of the Federal Constitution of the Supreme Court of California?
MR. IUNGERICH:

That, I think, is on the basis of

the Federal and the State Constitution.

It is clearly on the

basis of the State Constitution as well and it"does constitute
an adequate state law ground on that particular situation so
we really are concerned with that point, as to whether or
not double jeopardy is applicable in juvenile court proceedings
per se in this case because the situation involved here is
really a Benton question.
We are talking about the rights of this juvenile
when he gets to the point that he is actually in adult court.
v,

"In

°ther words, we are talking about — sorry —

QUESTION:

My question hypothecated if he were in

adult court just as he is in your actual case but the
d.i.txerence was, that he had been acquitted of the juvenile
charges /

•
MR. IUNGERICH:

He is in adult court and he has been

acquitted of the juvenile charge.

In other words, what the

district attorney has done in this case is refiled against
him?
QUESTION:

Yes.

15
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

In a subsequent case?

Yes.

MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, I think that I would reserve

that question until a future case because I think there may
be some eases pending on this Court’s docket.
At this point I would think that jeopardy, at
least as far as what this Court might say, x^ould have
attached in the lower proceeding but I think that is a quite
different case from ours because we don!t have that problem
here and I think the states that have statutes that permit
that at least ought to be allowed to defend that in this
forum without my conceding away their cases, where we don't
.have that problem involved in California.
QUESTION:

In California, if you try a juvenile in

an adjudicatory hearing and he is acquitted, or whatever
you call that — what do you call It, dismissed?
MR. IUNGERICH:

It is dismissed, yes.

It is a

dismissal
QUESTION:

Then could you bring him back and try

him again for the same thing in the juvenile court?
MR. IUNGERICH:

If it is dismissed, no -- 'under the

authority of the case of Richard M, versus Superior Court.
QUESTION:

That is a constitutional ruling.

MR. IUNGERICH:
Q UES TI ON:

That is a constitutional ruling.

State c ons t i t ut i on al.

16
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Under our State Constitution.

And federal?

MR. IUNGERICH:

And federal.

It was predicated on

both counts.
QUESTION:

So there is jeopardy. Under the California

law, jeopardy attaches.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Under California law, jeopardy

attaches.
QUESTION:

So your argument here is that it doesn’t

attach.
MR. IUNGERICH:

It Isn’t that it doesn't attach.

It

is that even if it does attach, it is not a violation.
QUESTION:

It has never been over.

I mean, there

has never been a case —
MR. IUNGERICH;
jeopardy.

There has never been an end to the

There is no new jeopardy when he is transferred to

the adult court.
QUESTION:

Now, Bryan was after Richard M?

MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, your Honor.

So Bryan —- Bryan approves this procedure

but doesn’t approve the retrial?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Right,

That is correct, your Honor.

Now, in this case, after he was trans­

ferred tc the regular adult court, he could have been
acquitted, couldn't he?

17
MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes, your Honor.

He would have a

second opportunity, really.
In this case what we have Is a situation where the
juvenile was given an opportunity for two adjudications
beyond a reasonable doubt and two opportunities for acquittal
and the state loses the conviction, in effect, that they
obtained in juvenile court to put at risk, again, In adult
court, of obtaining another conviction by the standard of
beyond a reasonable doubt.
The difference between the proceedings, of course,
and the reason why we have to conduct a second adult

trial

is that all of the basic rights that are accorded to an
adult criminal defendant have not been incorporated Into the
juvenile court process, particularly, under McKelver, the
right of Jury trial and in order to accord the juvenile
those rights before he is actually convicted in adult court,
we have to give him the second adult trial, as California
views the Constitution.
I think the important point here is that, In
analysing the protections of the Constitution that we have of
double jeopardy in the protections that it gives, really,
what we have here is a situation where if any of the pro­
tections that are mentioned in North Carolina versus Pearce
apply, it would have to be the protection against a second
conviction but .l. think that basically the language, the

18
understanding of — that I have of the protection against
the second conviction is this, that you actually have to have
two separate and distinct risks of punishment and in this
case there is one risk of punishment throughout.
When the petition was filed in the juvenile court
proceedings, at the very beginning of this case in California,
the Respondent was under

on notice that the possibility

of transfer and the possibility of an adult criminal sentence
was in that case and until he was actually committed to the
facilities of the juvenile court, that risk did not depart
the case.
.Aw cue point unat the case is transferred, the only
thing

that departs the case is not higher risk of punishment

thac is involved in the adult criminal proceedings but the
lesser punishments that would be involved — or the lesser
disposition of being kept in juvenile court.
it is really what you might say is the converse of
the Green situation, in grgenjrergus the United_States . where
there, on the lnitial case» there was a verdict of guilty with
regard to second-degree murder which meant an implicit
equivalent of first-degree murder.
Thereafter, the state tried to retry Green for first
it was
degree murder and/held that there was
some type of implicit

acquittal
You could not be retried under the double jeopardy

19
clause for the higher crime.
We have a converse situation here, which is that
the higher penalty never departed the situation.

There is

no new risk of punishment involved because the same risk
carried on throughout.
QUESTION:

But there is a different consequence to

the conviction other than the punishment, I take it.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Certainly there is a different

consequence to the conviction.
QUESTION:

I mean, the custody will be different.

MR. IUNGERICH:

The custody will be different.

Well, the [inaudible] is the same »—
QUESTION:

The conditions of custody will be

different.
MR. IUNGERICH:

— as in this case because what

actually happened was, the adult court decided to use the
facilities again of the California Youth Authority and it
Is possible that both the Juvenile Court and the Adult Court
may use that commitment to —
QUESTION:

No.

That is looking backwards.

That Is looking backwards.

They could have put

him somewhere else.
IUNGERICH: certainly, they could have put him —
QUESTION:

That's right and now we have got a

conviction which he would not have had If the case ended In

20
the Juvenile Court.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Certainly.

But I think that that

Is basically a question of policy for the state courts to
determine.

After all —
QUESTION:

different.

But just as a matter of fact, it is

It has different consequences.
MR. IUNGERICH:

*

QUESTION:

It has different consequences.

It may affect his right to vote.

It may

affect lots of things.
MR. IUNGERICH:

There are certainly collateral

consequences that are involved with a criminal conviction that
are not involved --QUESTION:
'

\
And, also, he has been tried twice.

MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

He has been tried twice.

You both agree that the adjudication is

a trial.
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And your suggestion is that unless there

is double punishment -MR. IUNGERICH:

Not double punishment, Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION:

Well, exposure to it.

MR. IUNGERICH:

He has to be exposed at two

different times —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. IUNGERICH:

— to separate and distinct

21

possibilities of punishment.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

And so you say,

just the fact that he is tried twice —MR. IUHGERICH:
QUESTION:

Is not enough.

So that, on your theory, I take it,

that a state should always be able to appeal as long as it
agreed not to punish him any more than the sentence that
was imposed the first time.
MR. IUNGERICH:

I do not think we are saddled

with that type of an argument, your Honor.
that position.

I would not take

I don’t think that the idea'of continuing

jeopardy could be extended.
In other- words, we made a policy decision, I think,
in our constitutional law in this country and after a man
has been acquitted, he cannot be tried again.
We do not have an acquittal in this situation,
however, where we need to have that type of finality.
What we are really talking about is a separate
type of court system which is the Juvenile Court system
which j.s basically making a determination whether or not
this juvenile should actually not be treated as an adult
and because of the nature of his crime and his prior back­
ground, they feel that in order to rehabilitate him, he
actually needs to be exposed to the criminal process because
they have exhausted their facilities.
We have, I think, quite different policy

22

considerations here than will be involved in a situation
where you have a case where a man has —*
QUESTION:

Well, at the end of — assume that he

went through the juvenile procedure and the entire juvenile
procedure was exhausted when he became, what, 21?

In your

state?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, at that time you decide that

21.

we just failed with this young man so we are going to now try
him as an adult.

We’ve had —

MR. IUNGERICH:

Frankly, that' is not our ease.

are not advocating that position.
QUESTION:

We

We are advocating only __

Well, I am not sure it is any different,

though, than that.
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, at that point, I don't think __

1 think that there is a different question, of course, as to
whether or not when they make a final, I would say, in my
theory where you have a separate risk of punishment, you have
two separate and distinct jeopardies at that point because
you haven’t had the lower — you have actually committed the
Wxui

1.0

the juvenile institution.

You have made a mistake.

I think the policy of finality, which is inherent
.m the juvenile — in the double jeopardy clause

should

-ipplv at thax point and say, well, we can’t sentence the man
a second time.

23
QUESTION:

After you have gone through the

dispositional hearing,, that should terminate the initial
jeopardy?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

What?

Once you have gone through the

dispositional stage —■
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

-- after Its adjudication -—

MR. IUNGERICH:

The only exception that I think

that there might be for that is there is the tentative
commitment to the Youth Authority where the man would be
referred back to Courts
In other words, this is really an extension of
the disposition hearing.

At that point, in California, the

Youth Auchority makes an evaluation of the man and they
decide, well, they don’t feel they can treat him and they
can send him back to Juvenile Court at that points very much
similar to diagnostic studies and in accordance
QUESTION:

You wouldn’t, at that point, transfer

him under your law?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Under that point Bland says we can

transfer him unde3:* our law.
QUESTION:

You made a point in your

brief, I

oelieve, that if you do not prevail, this will ,compel the
juvenile courts to superimpose on the present procedural

structure a preliminary hearing of some kind in every case
and that that will overburden an already overburdened court.
But isn’t it possible — that is the point you make,
isn’t it, Mr. lungerich?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Isn’t it possible, reasonably, to

identify in advance the cases which might be borderline adult
cases and give the preliminary treatment only to those cases?
MR. IUNGERICH:

Well, I don’t think it is clearly

a case that you can identify.

You can possibly identify

them but you can’t —
QUESTION:

Before he begins any proceeding, you

know what his prior record is, don’t you?
mR,

IuNGERICH:

Yes, the probation department

undoubi.0diy would have his
QUESTION:

prior record.

Do you know the nature of the crime or

the criminal conduct that he is charged with?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QuESriON:

Yes, your Honor.

And do you tell me that you couldn’t

identity, in a very large percentage of the cases?
IUNGERICH:

Well, the problem is not identifying.

1 '•'hlnk you can Possibly spot the transfer case, you know„
especially where you have got a murder or a robbery.

Usually

cue gravity of the offense even tells you something about that
although we are not supposed to transfer on

that basis.

25
What we are talking about, though, is that this

•

any attorney worth his salt, when he comes into the transfer
hearing, is going to want to fully thrash out all of the
issues as to why his client should not be transferred and
if he does that, what we are going to have is really two
trials and I think that that is the important point to make,
is that there are situations where the juvenile court judge
should have the discretion to hear the adjudication phase
first and then make his decision on transfer afterward to
a void two duplicate trials before two different judges.
Because what we are doing

by applying double

jeopardy in this case to cut off transfer of the disposi­
tional alternatives will, in effect, take that discretion
away from the judge so that he can maintain his calendar
and take those cases where he thinks that he is going to
have two contested hearings and he may have a situation
involving two full trials before two different judges and —
QUESTION:

What is the percentage of cases that are

transferred for adult trial?
MR, IUNGERICH:
10 percent and the

Do you know?

The percentage?

It is less than

exact figures at this point I don’t

know because our figures are — the last figures we have
availablea0f COurse, are 1972 figures and the Bureau of
Criminal Identification in California hasn’t come up with
its reports for 573 yet.

26
But at that point it was less than 10 percent.
The point is, with those cases, though, is that the
ones that are considered for transfer — and we don't know
how many — first of all, there are no statistics on the
number of waiver hearings that are actually held in California
where transfer is rejected and, of course, those are the cases
that are really going to cause the bottleneck for the
juvenile court because where transfer is rejected, that is
the situation where we are going to have the second trial
situation in the juvenile court and, actually, the problem
created for the juvenile court calendar — I think there is
no quescion that both sides in this case agree on the fact
■he1' the juvenile courts already have overcrowded dockets
and by taking out this possibility of giving them the flexi­

bility to actually void two duplicate trials in this
circumstance may really cut into their discretion and
actually lead to more congestion on their calendars.

I think that as well as the indication that there
is no violation of the principles of double jeopardy, I
think as well, the continuing jeopardy exception would give
us an additional peg on which to decide that this case does
not violate the double jeopardy provision of the Constitution,
In Price versus Georgia this held that its prior
cases had formulated a concept of continuing jeopardies —
jeopardy where criminal proceedings against the accused have

27

not run their full course and I think in this case the
proceedings against this individual did not run their full
course until he actually went to adult court and there was
a determination and an ultimate disposition.
Unlike any other case, there is a link between
these two proceedings and the link is the judicial transfer.
It is not a transfer that the prosecution can unilaterally
determine as for example,

filing a new case against this

man after the juvenile court has taken him into its own
facility.
QUESTION:

But it isn't one that commences at

the initiative of the defendant, either, the way it did in
Price or in Green.
MR. IUNGERICH:

It doesn’t commence at the

initiacive of the defendant,

I would submit that as the

footnote in Green — I mean, in Price indicates that
actually, you have an amalgam of interests in double jeopardy
cases but I don't think that it has

ever been a preeminent

type of thing where you require a waiver other than in, I
think, the retrial cases.
Even

the retrial cases I don’t think uniformly

go oil on the question of waiver and, indeed, I think Green
rejected the waiver theory in its analysis so that I think
that it depends on the particular case as to which one of
those interests, lack of finality or limited waiver or the

28
interests of society, which one of those is actually applied
in the case.
What I would submit is continuing jeopardy is not
a principle that can be solely limited to the retrial case.
The genius of our common lax* is that we can apply a principle
in one area over to a situation in another area where substantially the same policy consideration is found and I think
that is the situation we have here with continuing jeopardy
because the proceedings did not run their full course until
we had these adult proceedings against Mr. Jones in this
case.
QUESTION:

In the capital punishment days in

California you had a bifurcated trial system, didn't you?
MR. IUNGERICH:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Do you still

have that in some cases?

QUESTION:

Do you have the bifurcated

trial at all?
MR. IUNGERICH:

I know I think it was the exclusive -

well, we do have bifurcated trials in the insanity area.
In other words,

with insanity, you will have a

separate trial and you plead not guilty, by reason of insanity
at a separate trial.

a fifth penalty trial or something like that constituted
double jeopardy.
QUESTION:

Are you drawing a parallel in this case

to that kind of a system?
MR. IUNGERICH:

I don't think So.

I think that

that system is not quite the same situation that we have
here because we are not talking about -- well, it may well
be, because you have a conviction and then a sentence and
the jeopardy doesn't run — you’d have two trials in that
situation.
It may be a close parallel but I really haven't
considered that as a possibility because of the uniqueness
of the death penalty situation.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Walker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. WALKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. WALKER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it Please

the Court:
I would like initially to respond just briefly to
a couple of questions you asked my adversary.
First of all, Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to
your question about how many transfers there actually are
in California,

The latest statistics for 1972, which are

the last that are available, indicate that there are exactly
509 transfers out of 50,000 delinquency cases, so

only one

percent of the cases result in transfer to adult court.
Secondly,

1 would resist the characterization of

the fitness hearing in California as duplicate trial.

The

cases and the statutes are quite clear in pointing out that
a fitness hearing has nothing to do with a minor’s

guilt or

innocence.
Under California law, you are merely attempting to
determine, first, if a minor is over che age of 16.
Secondly, whether the minor is charged with a
criminal law violation, and,
Thirdly, whether the minor would be amenable to the
treatment programs or training facilities available to the

31
juvenile court.
In fact , the statute says that a minor cannot be
waived on the basis of his guilt or innocence of the crime.
That is not a

sole criterion and cannot be used as a

criterion for waiver.
QUESTION:

hearsay
Is
/ considered admissible at the

fitness hearing?
MR. WALKER:

At the fitness hearing there is

evidence that is admitted sometimes about the nature of the
offense.
Commonly, what happens is that the police report
may be introduced into evidence because there are no ---hearsay is admissible to fitness hearings so that evidence
is admissible but it is admitted solely for the purpose of
determining whether the minor is amenable to the juvenile
court facilities.
QUESTION:

Can counsel for the juvenile then offer

evidence of mitigating circumstances?
MR. WALKER:

He may well offer evidence of

mitigating circumstances, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that the preliminary

inquiry could not even hear about the nature of the crime
and —
MR. WALKER:

No, certainly not.

The nature of

the crime is relevant, but relevant only to the statutory

32
criterion of amenability,
Naturally, if they are dealing with a minor who
is charged with a murder or a rape, those are relevant facts
that the Court would take into consideration.
QUESTION:

I thought we were told that the case of

’Jimmy H, in the California courts said that there were three
criteria that the court should consider in dealing with this
ultimate statutory standard of amenability and one was the
seriousness of the offense, two was the previous record and
three was his basic amenability to the juvenile corrective
procedures.
Did I misunderstand that?
MR. WALKER:

That is incorrect characterization of

the case, from my point of view, your Honor.
The Supreme Court of California said in Jimmy H.
that the only evidence that must be considered by the court
in a fitness hearing is the probation report containing the
minor’s previous record.
There were a number of other factors, including
expert testimony, details about the nature of the offense,
but those, the Court said, were relevant only to the question
of amenability.
I think it is quite clear in the decision.
QUESTION:
is amenability.

Well, the ultimate statutory standard

33
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Correct.
Mr. Walker.

MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Now, this might —

Yes, your Honor.
Before you go ons do I understand

your position to be that at the fitness hearing or the
transfer hearing, that no evidence may be introduced as to
guilt or innocence?
MR. WALKER:

No.

There may be some evidence of

the nature of the crime which may also bear upon the minor's
guilt or innocence.

That evidence, though, will be taken

into consideration by the Court solely in the connection
with the statutory standard of amenability.
There is a requirement in California law that if
the minor is transferred, he must be given a preliminary
hearing within ten days, so the minor would be entitled to
that procedural protection under California statutory laitf.
QUESTION:

And the minor is entitled to counsel

at the transfer hearing?
MR. WALKER:
•QUESTION:

Yes, he is.
And suppose counsel insists on putting

in evidence the minor's innocence?
MR. WALKER:
in a case.

Is he entitled to do it?

I am not sure that has ever come up

I suppose in most cases the Court would hear it

although technically perhaps it might be considered almost
irrelevant.

34
This minor has been placed in jeopardy in two quite
different respects.

First of all, he has been tried twice

for the very same offense and this there is no dispute about
and our basic position is — and I think this is confirmed
by numerous opinions of this

Court —• that the double

jeopardy clause protects a defendant and let us not forget
that this is a convicted defendant, a minor who has been
convicted of a felony — that the double jeopardy clause
protects the defendant against the possibility of two
piosecu^lons for che same oifense, quite irrespective of the
penalties that might be opposed.
He suffered the anxiety, the insecurity, the
expense, et cetera of two trials for the very same crime.
Secondly, he was exposed to a considerably more

severe penalty

at the conclusion of his felony trial.

The maximum penalty that could be imposed by the
juvenile court in this case was to commit the minor to the
California Youth Authority until age 21.
The maximum penalty that he faced in his adult trial,
on the other hand, was a mandatory sentence from five years to
life imprisonment.

So he is certainly in the position of

having faced a very severe jeopardy in terms of the penalty
that could be imposed by the adult court.
How, in this case the adult court chose to commit
nim to the California Youth Authority and it is quite incorrect

35
to believe that that means that he has the same sentence as
an adult that he would have had as a juvenile.
As a juvenilej he could only be held by the
Youth Authority until he was 21.
As a convicted felon, he may be held by the Youth
Authority till age 25.
At present time, the minor is on parole from the
Youth Authority.

He is 22 and a half years of age.

indeed, he had been

If,

sent there by the Youth Authority,

he would already be free — excuse me, by the juvenile
couru, he would be free of the juvenile court's jurisdiction.
There is another aspect in xfhich he

has been

exposed not only to a more severe punishment but, in fact,
a double punishment and that is, he has been held in
Juvenile Hall for approximately three extra weeks as a
result of his totally unnecessary

jurisdictional hearing

in juvenile court.
Under California law he will receive no credit and
has received no credit with his commitment in the Youth
Authority.
So

we have three different respects in which this

minor has been placed in jeopardy.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you asked a question of my
colleague over here before about whether a minor could be
tranSierred after an acquittal.

I think that question is

36
open in California law but I would point out that there is
nothing in the transfer statute that precludes that and as
far as I know, there is no California case that is directly
on point.
QUESTION:

I suppose it wouldn't be technically a

transfer as a part of the juvenile procedures it would be the
district attorney filing de novo in the Superior Court.
What about Richard M.?
MR. WALKER:

Richard M, is a case where the minor

obtained an acquittal in juvenile court and then they
attempted to retry him in juvenile court.
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

And that was double jeopardy?
That was double jeopardy under the

Federal ana State Constitutions.

I would point out that --

Court adjourned until 10:03 o’clock a.m. the
