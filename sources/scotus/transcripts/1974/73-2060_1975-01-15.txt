MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

P- -s-

We’ll hear arguments

next in 73-2060# Austin against New Hampshire.
We will wait for a moment# counsel.

We'll wait for

a moment until the room gets a little quieter.
I think perhaps we can proceed now# Mrp Smith#
whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. SMITH# ESQ.#
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
This case arose out of a petition for declaratory
judgment brought by three Maine citizens and residents against
the State of New Hampshire and the taxing authorities of that
State# questioning the constitutional validity of the socalled commuters income tax in that State# both on the basis
that it was a violation of the United States Constitution
and a violation of the constitutional provisions of the State
of New Hampshire.
It was reported as a# what they call in the State of
New Hampshire# a reserve case# to the Supreme Court of that
State# and that court found that the petitioners had standing#
that the vehicle for getting there# the declaratory judgment
method# was the proper vehicle, but denied the relief requested?
and# as a result# it comes'before this Court on appeal from

that decision.
There are two constitutional issues which are
raised in the case.
One is that the Neitf Hampshire statute is violative
of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV,
Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States? and of
the Fourteenth Amendment, . Equal Protection Clause in that
Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, before you get into that,

if you prevail here, what do you gain?
MR» SMITH:

If we prevail here, I presume that what

our people gain is the payment of tax in their own State»
We get to a question, I think that you're raising, may it
please the Court, the question of standing, which is a corollary
issue in this case, which
QUESTION:

Well, I'm not at all, personally, worried

about the question of standing.

But aren't you asking only

to pay the same tax dollar to the State of Maine rather than
the State of New Hampshire?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes.
And therefore, -—
We're asking that they pay the same

tax dollar to the State of Maine rather than the State of New
Hampshire, because they would get the benefits of the payment
of their tax dollar in the State of Maine that they do not

5

get in the State of New Hampshire, may it please the Court.
QUESTION;

But isn't this a legislative decision

by the Maine Legislature?
MR* SMITH;

Would you repeat the question, may it

please the Court, so that I understand it?
QUESTION:

Isn't that a decision that the Maine

Legislature itself has made?
MR. SMITH;

I do not believe that that’s a question

of the Maine Legislature, and I think we get into what the
Privileges and Immunities Clause was designed to prevent, we
get into what we call retaliatory legislation.

If one State

starts to retaliate against another State because of the
taxing statutes of that particular State, may it please the
Court.
QUESTION:

But hasn't the Maine statute, in effect,

provided and recognized the propriety of this payment to the
State of Hew Hampshire?
MR. SMITH:

I do not believe that the Maine

statute, or the Legislature has recognized the propriety of
the payment to New Hampshire.

Simply the Maine statute, as

most income statutes, most State income tax statutes, gives a
credit, may it please the Court, to taxes paid on income in
other jurisdictions in the State of Maine; they give it
against the Maine tax.
QUESTION:

And that is --

A credit or a deduction?

6

HR. SMITH s

Pardon?

QUESTION;

Is that a credit or a deduction?

MR. SMITH;

It’s a credit against the tax.

QUESTION; H credit, yes.
QUESTION;

I guess another way to phrase my question

is whether this isn't just a lawyer’s lawsuit?
MR, SMITH;

No, I think these people feel very

strongly about this, and this is why we are in this Court.
QUESTION; Well, the taxpayers may, but their
Legislature has permitted it by
MR. SMITH;

Their Legislature — I am sure their

Legislature could change it by —
QUESTION:

Sure.

MR* SMITH;

— doing away with the credit and

then we get into all the .retaliatory legislative processes
against

one State against another, which this Court has

said the Privileges and Immunities Clause was designed to
prevent.
QUESTION;

Of course, their Legislature, too, plight

feel that even though they could exact full measure of the
Maine tax, there would be an element of unfairness in the eyes
of that Legislature to these procedures„
MR. SMITH;

I presume that that's the reasoning

or the rationale behind it, may it please the Court.
We get to ■—

7
QUESTION:

Well, it might end up with the

proposition, hoxirever, that if you prevail here your clients
are out the same amount of dollars.
MR. SMITH:

They're out the same amount of dollars,

but they * re going to have those amount of dollars spent in
their State, under the provisions of this statute, where they
receive the benefits of those amount of dollars spent, either
by way of reduction of taxation in their State, because of an
additional amount of income in their State, or by the benefit
of the services that they can receive.
QUESTION: Then the answer to ttefc is that the Maine
Legislature, if it chooses to do that, can change itse
statute.
MR, SMITH:

If it changes its statute, if that —

it could simply do away with the credit, and then, of course,
as Mr, Justice Rehnquist just pointed out, it would impose
an additional burden on all of the Maine taxpayers that are
working out of the State and having income taxes imposed -»*
in other words, they'd be subject to double taxation, which
would be unfair,
QUESTION:

Well, that happens all over the country.

MR, SMITH:

We have double taxation, I will agree

to that? but I think that would be one of the impositions that
result.
The State of New Hampshire has raised before this

Court the question of standing, and we would say that ■— we
answer that very simply, we've answered it in our brief, but
we say that this is the case of a taxpayer which is question­
ing the imposition of a tax -- or questioning the statute
which imposes the tax upon the taxpayer, and not the question
that has so often come before this Court of a taxpayer
questioning the spending of taxpayers* funds»
And we submit that that is quite a difference.

We

feel that the taxpayer always has a right to challenge the
constitutional validity of a statute under which he is taxed,
and we think that we have precedent in this Court in the
Allied Stores case, which is cited in our brief, which was an
Ohio case which is similar in almost all respects, except
that that was not an income tax, that was an ad valorem tax
in that case.
And the very question, I think, that was raised a
moment ago here by the Court, was decided in that case»
That was a case where Allied Stores of Ohio was a resident
corporation, and they were taxes on merchandise in storage,
and under the provisions of the Ohio statute merchandise
that was kept in storage by non-residents were not taxed.
And under the Equal Protection Clause, they brought it to this
Court.
They brought it to this Court after the Supreme
Court of the State of Ohio had denied standing, saying that it

9
didn't make any difference to the taxpayer in that case, that
if they struck out that proviso as to the non-»resident
proviso, that, nevertheless, they would be subject to the same
amount of tax.
And this Court said that they had standing to raise
the issue, and then went on and decided the constitutional
issues in the case.
We say that we're in exactly the same standing»
We also say that we have a — were subject to injury
under this statute, because the petitioners here, the appellants
in this case, as I have pointed out, would get the benefit
of their tax dollar in the State of Maine, or a reduction of
taxes in the State of Maine, if their tax dollar was retained
by that State.
I think we have to understand the background of
standing as we're talking about it.

We have to understand

something about the New Hampshire statute.
The New Hampshire statute does not tax the income
of the residents of New Hampshire in that State.

It pretends

to tax the income of New Hampshire residents working in another
State, but I say, I use the word "pretend" because they make
two exemptions which literally destroys the taxation provision,
because they make the first exemption:

that if* the other

State imposes a tax, then that New Hampshire resident is not
subject to an income tax in the State of New Hampshire, and

10

if the other State does not impose a tax on income, then,
likewise, the New Hampshire resident is not subject to a tax
in the State of New Hampshire.
So that under no conceivable condition can a New
Hampshire resident be taxed on his income in the State of
New Hampshire,

This tax is only imposed — this income tax

is only imposed against non-residents.

It's a flat four

percent tax in excess of the first $2,000 of income; or,
stated another way, there's $2,000 exempt, and it's a flat
four percent.
Then they adjust the tax.

They say that if, in the

State of non-residence, the tax would be lesser, then they
impose the lesser tax.
QUESTION:

In that respect, Mr, Smith, suppose that

Maine didn't have an income tax at all, would that mean that
New Hampshire would —
MR. SMITH:

Then they would pay no tax in the

State of New Hampshire,
QUESTION: They would what?
MR. SMITH:

They would pay no tax in ~~

QUESTION: They would pay no tax?
MR. SMITH:

— in the State of New Hampshire.

Theoretically, under the law, they would pay a
tax, but they would get it back.

But that’s not the way they

work in practical effect in the State of New Hampshire.

11

They would pay no tax.

If Maine had no income tax in the

State of Maine, they would — there would be no income tax
imposed in the —
QUESTION?

Is it your statement, then, as to the

effect of that purported tax on New Hampshire residents
earning income out of the State, that it simply categorically
doesn't affect a single person in that classification, by
reason of —
MR. SMITH:
statement.

I would have to make that categorical

I can’t conceive of any condition —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION s
MR. SMITH::

A gimmick, in other words?
It
A sham.
It’s a sham, that’s exactly what I say,

I said it was a pretext, but that’s exactly what I’d sayI can’t conceive of any condition where a New Hampshire
resident working out of State is going to be taxed on his
income in the State of New Hampshire.
No possible way.
And it is because of this credit and because of
the — that the State of New Hampshire says that the petitioners
do not have standing.

I think I have covered that fairly

well, as I go along here, both from the point of view of
prior pronouncements of this Court and of the pocketbook issue.
I would point out one other thing, that as a result

12
of this Hew Hampshire statute, non-residents of the State of
New Hampshire,, working in New Hampshire, of course, are
subject to criminal penalties under the income tax law x^here
the residents of New Hampshire are not subject to any
penalties at all in this respect.
They raise one other question which is a corollary
issue, and I think that I should address just a moment of my
time to that.

/

And that is that we have not overcome the
presumption of constitutionality of the statute, of the
taxing statute in the State of New Hampshire.

And we say

that that presumption disappears, recognizing that there is a
presumption of constitutionality, we say that that presumption
disappears, first of all, becuase this Court has said, in the
Mu Haney case, cited in our brief, that the mere imposition
of the tax does not constitute that the statute is a valid
statute.
And, secondly, because of xtfhat this Court said in
the case of Bailey vs. Drexel Furniture Company -- and it's
a case not cited in my brief, and I timely gave this case to
counsel for the State of New Hampshire — found in 259 IJ.S.
20, which was —QUESTION:
MR« SMITH:
QUESTION:

What's the cite?
259 U.S. 20, may it please the Court.
Thank you.

13
MR. SMITH:

This was a case of a child labor tax,

and it was a federal statute rather than a State statute that
was in question, and this Court said — but I cannot see
that that makes any difference.

But this Court said, the

presumption of validity cannot prevail because proof of the
contrary is found on the very face of its provisions.
In other words, in that case, they said:

On the

face of that statute itself, it is unconstitutional on the
face of the provisions of the statute, and therefore it cannot
prevail.
Getting down to the matter of the constitutional
invalidity, on the two questions that I mentioned, the two
issues that I mentioned a moment ago, I think that the State
of New Hampshire, the appellees in this case, misread the case
of Shaffer vs. Carter, on which they seem to bottom their
argument that their tax is within constitutional limits,
In that case, — there were two cases decided at the
same time by this Court, that case and the Travis vs. Yale &
Towne Manufacturing Company case — and in that case, which
was an Oklahoma case, it established only that a State might
impose an income tax on non-residents,

That was the thrust,

main thrust of that case.
But in that case, Oklahoma also had an income tax
against its residents, and the burden was not more onerous on
non-residents than it was upon residents.

14
And I think that that is a complete thrust of that
case, as I have read it.

They went into some other matters,

but I think that's the thrust of it, because, at the same
time of -that court, we came down with the case of Travis vs.
Yale & Towns Manufacturing Company, which was the — the New
York statute was in question, and I’m sure this Court is
familiar with the case.

We cited it in our brief.

Where

non-residents were not granted the same exemption as residents.
And in that case they said that there was not —
that this was a violation of the Privileges and Immunities
Clause of the United States, that they were not granted —
non-residents working in that State were not granted the
same —
QUESTIONS

Was that Yale & Towne?

MR. SMITHs

Yale & Towne.

— were not granted the same privileges as the
taxpayer in the State of New York, the resident taxpayer in
the State of New York.
This statute is not — yes?
QUESTIONS
MR. SMITH?
QUESTION;

Let me back up a little bit, Mr. Smith.
Surely.
You — at least I thought you said

earlier that the Maine residents are subject to criminal
penalties in New Hampshire if they work there and don't
pay their taxes, but that for the nonpayment of the same kind

15
of a tax by a New Hampshireman, in New Hampshire, he’s only
subject to civil penalties?
MR, SMITH!

New Hampshire doesn’t have a tax, so

that New Hampshire residents couldn’t, under any condition,
be subject to a tax,
QUESTION! Well, then, I did misunderstand you»
MR» SMITH:

Yes, I'm sorry, I — New Hampshire does

not impose a tax upon its residents of any kind, and therefore
there could b© no criminal penalties against any resident of
the State of New Hampshire,
QUESTION:

Now, as to that point, what provision

of the Constitution do you say that offends?
MR. SMITH:

I say that that only goes « I an only

pointing that out on the question of standing, may it please
the Court, but I didn’t go to a constitutional
QUESTION:

Don't you think it offends any other

provisions of the Constitution?
MR. SMITH:

I presume that it does, but I'm not a *—

I have to tell you, sir, that I'm not a constitutional lawyer.
But I would suspect that it would offend both the Privileges
and Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection Clause,
QUESTION?

Well, you got here.

You got here,

QUESTION:

And you've been doing all right,

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

[laughing].

QUESTION;

But when we note a case, it's usually

16

a constitutional lawyer who has set up something to persuade
us to do it.
But, to pursue that a moment, the Equal Protection
Clause is at least one of -the candidates that might be
violated by this provision?
MR. SMITH:

We say so.

That this is our

this

is our argument, may it please the Court, because, first of
all, it doesn't —* we say it's completely arbitrary as to
its classification, and that the — has no fair or substantial
relationship to the object of the legislation.
This is not, by the way, a statute which has
dedicated revenues, it is not a statute which says that nonresidents working the State of New Hampshire constitute some
peculiar or particular source of evil, as was talked about
in the Toomer case which is cited in our brief.
It just goes in, the moneys just go into the
General Fund of the State of New Hampshire, and they try to
justify this, the

New Hampshire Supreme Court, by saying that

its practical effect is offset because they do have a tax
in the State of New Hampshire which non-residents do not
participate in, on unearned income over the sum of $600,
But many States have that same kind of a tax, and the reason
that you do not tax non-residents in that kind of taxing
scheme would be that you would dry up capital in that
particular State, of flowing into the State of New Hampshire.

17
And I’m sure that that can’t offset in any respect
the —
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith* does the record show how

much we’re really talking about, in dollars* in this case?
MR. SMITH;

No* it does not.

The amicus curiae

brief filed by the State of Maine and the State of Vermont
indicates that we are talking in — as far as the State of
Maine is concerned — in the neighborhood for that year of
1970, because this is the first year of the law* immediately
attacked* of $400*000* may it please the Court* for that
particular year.
What it is at the current time* I do not know,
QUESTION;

In other words* Maine loses that amount

MR» SMITH;

Maine loses that amount of money.

of money?

Now, my only authority for that is in the amicus curiae brief*
which is filed in this Court.
Now, there is one other peculiar feature about this
law* that I want to point out — we've pointed it out in the
brief* but I would like to discuss it for just a moment •—
and that is that it treats non-residents unequally* because
of this tax credit.
In other words, the State of Maine and the State of
Vermont and the non-residents of the State of Massachusetts*
all working at the same job* contribute* because of their own

18
State statutes, taxing statute, contribute in different sums
of money, although they might have the same job, the same
income, the same amount of exemptions and dependents.

They

would all be treated differently.
In fact, the non-resident coming from a State which
imposes no income tax would pay no income tax in the State
of New Hampshire at all, although he’s working at the same
job, getting the same income in the State of New Hampshire
as other non-residents are.
So that it treats, among non-residents, it treats
them unequally and unfairly.
QUESTIONS

A non-resident coming from a State

which imposes no income tax would pay no New Hampshire income
tax?
MR. SMITH:
Court.

That is correct, may it please the

No New Hampshire income tax at all.
The State of Massachusetts, as a matter of fact,

would pay a far greater tax because of their taxing structure
than the resident of the State of Maine.

We'vs set forth

some illustrations in our brief.
But it doesn't even treat the class —
QUESTION:

How about Vermont residents working in

New Hampshire?
MR. SMITH:

Vermont pays a different tax, and I've

forgotten whether it’s more or less.

I think it's more

19
than the State of Maine, because I think their tax rate is —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Vermont does have an income tax?
Yes, Vermont does have an income tax.
Yes.

QUESTION:

A very high one.

MR. SMITH:

Very high —- a fairly high tax, and I’m

sure that —
QUESTION;

That's a resident of Vermont suggesting

that.
MR. SMITH:

So they would pay — they vrould pay a

tax that's even higher than the State of Maine, but it
treats — the point is that it treats all of this classifiestion of non-residents unequally, the taxing structure itself?
which again we say is violative of the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the United States, and again it's
violative also of the Equal Protection Clause.
I don't think that —
QUESTION:

Well, on the other hand, Mr. Smith, —

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

QUESTION:

— if New Hampshire did tax its own

residents at this four percent rate, at their income, then
you would have no constitutional case at all, would you?
MR. SMITH:

We would have no constitutional case.

We wouldn't be here, maybe.
QUESTION:

Even though, with respect to non-residents,

20
there would still be tills same unequal incident,
MR, SMXTIIs
QUESTION;

Well, I'm not sure —
— depending upon whether or not they

lived in Vermont, Massachusetts or Maine?
MR. SMITH;

I think perhaps I *— if all of the

— if all of the — yes, I have to withdraw what I said.
I think we'd still have a constitutional imperfection among
non-residents in that respect, although New Hampshire
residents were taxed.
But we do not quibble here that if all non­
residents and all residents were taxed alike that we'd have
no constitutional *—
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

Right, you'd have no case at all.
We'd have no case at all, and that's

not — that's not our quarrel.
QUESTION;

That's not this situation, but I'm

trying to see what your attack is.
MR, SMITH;

Yes, my thought would be because you're

still using non-residents — treating non-residents unequally.
QUESTION; Well, you're treating — assume there
•

r

were a four percent tax on residents of Maine —
MR, SMITH; Residents, right.
QUESTION;

— which I know there is not, but let's

assume there is.
MR. SMITH;

Yes

21

QUESTIONS

And also a four percent tax on non­

resident commuters to come to Nev; Hampshire to work, but with
the same provisions as still now exist? that would mean some
non-residents would get a better break than others.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
But you wouldn’t have the same

constitutional attack you now have, would you?
MR» SMITH:

I think — I think — under that posture,

I think we would, because non-residents — non-residents —
If it just fell on, an occasional burden fell on some taxpayer,
on the single taxpayer, then we perhaps would have no
constitutional question.
But here we have a classification of taxpayers,
so that you have within — your sub-classes, you have unequal
treatment.

And I think that would be violative, certainly

violative of the -- you're taxing the brown-eyed people with
one tax, and you're taxing the blue-eyed people at another
tax, may it please the Court.
QUESTION;

But none of them would be taxed higher

than would be the residents of New Hampshire.
MR. SMITH:

No, but that — that wouldn't affect, in

my opinion, the constitutional infirmity of the taxing
structure,
QUESTION;

Well, I grant you, you have at least

a — not so strong an attack as you now have.

22

MR. SMITH;
we now have.

We wouldn't have as strong an attack as

We have, we think, a very strong attack at this

time, may it please the Court.
QUESTION:

Your Privileges and Immunities argument

would stand, though, wouldn’t it, even though all non­
residents were treated alike, simply because of the difference
in treatment between non-residents and residents.
QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;
Court.

Right.

Sure.

That is correct, may it please the

That -- I think this Court has spoken several times

that just residency alone, the citizenship alone, as this
Court has said in these cases, is not a -— is an arbitrary
classification unless there's something more, unless that
group constitutes some particular or peculiar source of evil
to the — which the statute is designed to correct, may it
please the Court.
QUESTION;

Well, the Privileges and Immunities would

reach only the discrimination between residents and non­
residents.
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION;

That is correct, yes.
And the other is an Equal Protection

argument.
MR. SMITH;

The other is the Equal Protection

Clause, which will — which only State residents can take
advantage of, but non-residents can also take advantage of,

23
may it please the Court»
QUESTION:

In other words, if the tax structure of

Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine were precisely the same , so
that the effect was precisely the same on all non-residents ,
nonetheless, you'd., have a Privileges and Immunities attack
because there’s no tax at all on New Hampshire wage-earnerst

That's correct.

That's right»

That's the heart of it, right.

MR, SMITH:

That's the heart of our case, may it

please the Court,
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, you're familiar the federal

estate tax system, aren't you?
MR,

SMITH:

I’m

not an estate tax lawyer, we have

other people in our firm that do that? I'm familiar with it
generally, yes,
QUESTION:

Under the federal estate tax system,

there is, or at least used to be, a credit for State
inheritance and estate taxes paid, and many States, because
their inheritance tax would not eat up the twenty percent
credit, passed an estate tax to take up the slack.

And I

guess I'm asking whether that doesn't afford a precedent to
precisely what New Hampshire is doing here.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I'm not sure.

There have been

24

some decisions by this Court, and I'm not familiar with all
of them.

I'm not sure that that would be precisely the same

question that we have here.
It sounds to me, as you expound the question, that
it would be the same? but I'm not sure that in -the —

case.

I don't think that it would be in that

You have there, at most, an Equal Protection violation.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Or a Due Process violation.
You might have Due Process, right.

I have nothing further, may it please the Court,
unless the Court has other questions.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may save your

remaining time for rebuttal, Mr. Smith.
Mr, Cleaveland,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES G. CLEAVELAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CLEAVELANDs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In our view, this case does not involve any novel
issues of constitutional law, although it may be said to
raise some familiar principles in a nex<? configuration.
It's my objective here today to demonstrate that

25
this new configuration is not an occasion for this Court to
depart from those familiar principles, and that a logical
application of these principles compels the conclusion that
the decision of the New Hampshire Supreme Court should be
affirmed.
Now, the principal contention which we urge upon
this Court, and have set out in the brief, is that the
appellants suffer no injury in fact by the imposition of the
New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax.
We are asserting that this tax is in fact a balance
provision, designed to reach non-residents for a ratable
contribution in support of the government.

This is the

language which appeared in Shaffer v. Carter, and I think is
a settled principle upon which a State can tax non-residents
upon income earned within its jurisdiction.
I think it appropriate to say at this point that
the appellants' description of the operatam of the tax,
although I frankly concede that the provision which he labels
a sham in fact does not reach any State resident with any
tax burden, yet I would stop short of labeling it a sham,
because, if you read the taxing statute in its entirety,
you see that in fact a tax is imposed -- sticking to the
strictly legal effect of the word "imposed" -- a tax is imposed
on residents and non-resident alike.
QUESTION:

And —

Mr. Cleaveland, —

26
MR. CLEAVELANDs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor?
this Court has certainly gone a

long way in saying that you can’t be absolutely equal and
that some differences will be tolerated in this sort of
thing, but is there any single resident of New Hampshire that
would — you know, in existence -- that would pay a tax as a
result of that provision?
MR. CLEAVELAND;

I don't think -“no, I think —

the short answer to that, Your Honor, is no.

I think the

counsel for the appellants' position is correct, that he
can't conceive of one, I can't conceive of one.
The — I think in my brief I have attempted to
analyze the language of that provision for a tax upon
residents, in the light in which it was intended, which is
to create a category of taxation.

In that light, the lav?

of New Hampshire is of interest because we do not permit a
disparate rate of taxation upon the same classification of
property.
That is to say, we could not have a graduated income
tax.
So, statutes in New Hampshire tend to pay close
attention to the description of the classification of the
income, or the classification, rather, of the property which
in this case is income earned in a State not of the residence
of the person earning it.

27
The point I'm trying to make is quite simples

that

quite apart from the fact that the provision purporting to
tax Mew Hampshire residents never in fact does so, nevertheless,
the effect of that statute, of that part of the statute is
that it does not alter the tax burden of any resident.
Likewise, the taxing provision which reaches non-residents
does not and cannot, under its own terms, alter the net
tax burden of any non-resident,
And that is essentially the point I'd like to — I
would like to urge upon the Court in relation to the —
QUESTIONs

Well, if you didn't collect from the

non-residents, the residents would have to pay something,
wouldn't they?
MR. SMITH;

I'm sorry, Your Honor, could you re­

phrase that?
QUESTION; Well, where would you get the $400,000 that
now you get from the Maine people?
MR. SMITH;

There’s no question but what the

statute accomplishes a diversion of revenue to New Hampshire,
Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Right,

But you said that it wouldn't

change the New Hampshire people.

I submit it would. They'd

have to raise that tax from the New Hampshire people.
MR. SMITH;

Well, Your Honor, I think that would be

a — that is — well, at least it's a political decision, I'm

28

not, certainly, authorized to stata.
QUESTION:

But --

Well, it’s often been said that the best

political move you can make is to tax somebody else other
than the people that vote for you.
[Laughter,]
MR, SMITH:
Your Honor.

They’ve been doing it for a long time,

I don’t — don’t dispute that.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't part of your answer that

this is a political question, which the Maine Legislature
has resolved?
MR. SMITH:

I hasten to point that out, Your Honor,

That would be my next point, to be sure, that the -- it is a
little bit awkward to see taxpayers in here, urging, as an
injury, a loss of revenue by the State of Maine.
We are urging here that the injury which the
appellants attempt to set up, if there is indeed any, which
is cognizable in terms of its substantiality, runs to the
State of Maine and not to these appellants.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Maine law would be

acceptable politically or constitutionally, or any other
way, if it said, We allo’w credits for all payments, all
income tax payments made in other States except Vermont —
except New Hampshire?
MR. SMITH:

I'm not sure that ~ well, I think to

answer the question candidly, Your Honor, I think that if the

29
Maine law were to be phrased in that terms, it may be
subject to a challenge, but it would certainly be — the
answer would be, then, that the New Hampshire tax —
QUESTIONS

I know, but the legislative solution

requires — if that isn't acceptable, then the legislative
solution requires denying credits to everybody.
MR. SMITH:
Your Honor.

I don't think that that is the case,

I think the Maine Legislature could certainly

politically take the position that we consider the New Hampshire
tax to be, for instance, unconstitutional: and in terms, both
for that reason and in terms of reciprocity, they could grant
a credit only where the other State neglects to tax, or
chooses not to tax Maine residents.
That's what reciprocity is all about.
QUESTION:

Why is if —

MR» SMITH:

Excuse me.

QUESTION:

I could go back to Madison's notes of

the debates in the Constitutional Convention, on the
Privileges and Immunities Clause, and find that that is just
the sort of thing they had in mind, that they didn't want the
States to be doing.
MR, SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think the -•** I'll
bring this point up, then, out of order in my argument: 1
intended to make it last, but it's just as appropriate now.
A recent case in Mew Jersey considered the New

30

Jersey's Counterpart Pee Act, that case was brought here
and was recently dismissed by this Court for wat of a
substantial federal question.
out of New Jersey, was s

The holding in that case,

in the case where a fee was

assessed by the State of New Jersey on trucks operating in
interstate commerce, which were not registered in New Jersey,
the fee is assessed to the extent that, and in the amount
that, the State of registration of that truck would tax a
New Jersey truck.
And the Court went into great lengths and great
detail in discussing the question of so-called retaliatory
statutes, and hinted that maybe that was an inappropriate
label for such a statute.

Because, in fact, the effect of

them is to further and encourage reciprocity and comity
between States.
I think the New Hampshire statute has a considerable
element of that nature to it.
In fact, Section 6 of the New Hampshire Act
provides that the taxing administrator may enter into a
reciprocity agreement with any other State which, under which
we would cease to tax the non-resident from that State if
they would cease to tax residents of New Hampshire working
in that State.
Under that — under those terms, since Maine now
taxes New Hampshire residents, we would be in a position to

31

say:

If you stop taxing New Hampshire residents, we will

stop taxing Maine residents.
And then everybody would be free to go home and tax
their own people, and that would be the end of that.
So I think ~~ that is the direct answer to your
question, I think, Your Honor — this statute, the New Jersey
statutes, as illustrated in the brief filed by the State of
New Jersey, all operate to encourage reciprocity*
In the meantime, I do not deny, obviously, that
they raise revenue for the State of New Hampshire.

Nor would,

I suspect, New Jersey deny that they raise revenue for the
State of New Jersey.
But the force behind them, and one of the theories
upon which they can be sustained, is that they do encourage
comity and they do encourage reciprocity.
The history of the New Jersey statute is very
enlightening in that respect, because it started off on the
basis of reciprocity and was converted by the State of New
York changing its credit arrangements.
Moving on, we suggest that the facts adduced by the
brief filed by the State of Maine refer to the citizens, all
the citizens of Maine and not just those subject to the
Commuters Income Tax*

Thus, it shows that even that impact,

that injury, if there is any, is secondary, having first
passed through the treasury of the State of Maine.

32
Now, I say that, addressing the point that, to the
extent that there is any additional tax burden upon the
residents of Maine because of the loss of revenue by the State
of Maine, it is,one, de minimis; the State of Maine itself
produces the fact that — off the record and in its brief —
that the net increase in burden, for instance, upon each
citizen is forty cents.
I would submit that that simply does not rise to
the level of injury which ought to permit this Court to
overrule a taxing statute of a sovereign State, on the grounds,
for instance, of Equal Protection or, for that matter,
Privileges and Immunities.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES G. CLEAVELAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF
MR. CLEAVELAND:

THE APPELLEES -- Resumed
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; and

may the Court please:
I believe I was in the middle of discussing, or
finishing up on the point of the withholding tax, and the
extent to which that accomplished an injury, cognizable injury
to the appellants here,
I'm maintaining that it does not, in that it is
de minimis, and it is part and parcel of the — what the
Court in prior decisions has labeled the necessary administra­
tive burden of collecting, assessing and collecting a tax,
I should point out, in the case of a tax upon, on
non-residents, that in fact the withholding provision is just
about the only way that the State who is collecting the tax
can be assured of getting it, since, if the cash is let out
of the State, the collection then becomes an out-of-State
proceeding, and it's very difficult.
The case of Travis v. Yale & Towne stood for the
proposition that the withholding arrangements would not
constitute a sufficient injury to result in either a violation

36

of Privileges and Immunities, or a deprivation of the Equal
Protection.
Moving on, I assert that the injury which exists
here, by virtue of the in-fact diversion of revenue, is an
injury which belongs to the State of Maine, to be asserted by
the State of Maine, if by anybody at all, and that to that
extent this case brought by taxpayers is more in a nature of
a political question, and an attempt by the taxpayers to
litigate the interest of other parties.
QUESTION;

Since you're making that basic argument,

Mr, Cleaveland, you're telling us, in effect, that the
Supreme Court of New Hampshire was wrong in finding standing,
because that's the traditional and most elementary test of
standing is?

was the plaintiff injured?

And you said no,

in this case the plaintiff is not injured? no injury in fact»
And that's — if there's no injury in fact, then
the plaintiff was without standing, and to that extent your
Supreme Court was mistaken*

That must be what you’re telling

us.
MR. CLEAVELAND;
I have the liberty here to

You're right, Your Honor.

I think

say that I did argue against the

standing of these plaintiffs in the Supreme — in the New
Hampshire Supreme Court, but, as noted in the footnote in
Flast v. Cohen, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has one of
the most liberal attitudes on standing in the country? they

37

will recognize the standing of just about anybody.

Which is

perhaps a reflection of the caseload that they carry# and I’ve
noted in the brief time —

QUESTION:

It’s true# as you know# I'm sure# in

And this Court will says

MR. CLEAVE LAND;
my brief# Your Honor.

under State

Right*

Well# you

And vice versa.

I've pointed that out in

There's no question but what this

Court has different standards to apply when considering a
question of standing.
Just to begin with# it must consider the fact that
this Court's jurisdiction is limited by the Constitution to
actual cases and controversies.
And I think that one of the elements which this
Court should consider in deciding' the extent to which this is
really a case in which these plaintiffs have an interest is
the fact that the expressions of interest in this case by
other States, specifically Vermont# Maine# and New Jersey#
is one measure of just how much an interest the States have
in the outcome of this.

And is again a measure of the extent

33

to which this is really a contest between various States for
the right to collect revenues.
Moving on again, I think it follows almost
immediately, in the wake of our contention that there is no
injury in fact here, that, as we have been discussing, the
appellants have no standing to prosecute this appeal.
Trying to condense this point slightly, I think
it's hornbook law that standing to litigate a constitutional
issue requires a demonstrable injury in fact, upon which the
complaint may be founded.
This requirement, as I mentioned, is a part and
parcel of the constitutional limitation with respect to cases
and controversies.
But also I think reflects the fundamental fact that
the Constitution is not designed to settle specific disputes,
but, rather, provides certain broad rights and privileges.
Thus, a complaint under the Constitution is primarily
a complaint about conduct which results in a deprivation or
infringement of a right or privilege.

In other words, if

there is no injury, there is no deprivation? and the complaint
should not — a complainant, excuse me, should not be heard
to say that there is.
This illustrates the extent to which, in my brief,
I have tried to tie together the argument that there is no
injury with the argument that there is no standing with the

3S

argument that there is no deprivation»
In this particular circumstance, I think the whole
thing turns on the question of the injury»
QUESTION:
injury?

How do you distinguish deprivation from

Do you regard them as two different things?
MR* CLEAVE LAND:

I think if there is conduct, for

instance, an action by a State, Your Honor, which results in
or trespasses upon a constitutional right, I think the conduct,
in the first place, the action by the State results in, say,
an injury which would be, say, a tax burden, an increased
tax burden, a disproportionate tax burden*
That results in a deprivation of a constitutional
right under certain circumstances.
Now, I think if — what I'm getting at -- the
negative predicate "therefrom" is that if there is no additional
tax burden, for instance, then there is no injury to that
particular person, which would — could be said to result in a
deprivation of a constitutional right,
I think that is the — that's part and parcel of
what standing in a case and controversy argument is all about.

Well, what about the case — Toomer v.

residents, would it have been a sufficient answer there to
tell this man that if had done his shrimping in North Carolina

waters, if that was where he lived, he would have had to pay
a fee which North Carolina charged, so he really wasn't
injured?
MR, CLEAVELAND:

I think Tooiner v. Wifcsell, if I

recall it correctly, Your Honor, is that it is just a fee
case, a privilege case; and the disproportion of the
assessments there was so radical as to practically wipe out
any argument that there, for instance, were available -or assessed upon residents other fees which would make the
assessment uniform,

I think in the stance in which this case rests now,

my argument is that it is conceivable that this is so, that
there is son® kind of a proximate balance, and it is suffici­
ently conceivable that that is so, that the plaintiff who
wants to challenge this statute should have an affirmative
burden to show that it is not,

the interest in furthering reciprocity to that extent.

would indicate that people who do not reside in those three
States may work in New Hampshire?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

I don't believe there is any data,

I could be corrected on that, if my brother knows of some;
but I'm not aware of any data which would indicate what
proportion of the taxpayers are from other than those three

In other words, they would be taxed for that part of the

QUESTION:

MR» CLEAVELAND:

Never be higher.

MR. CLEAVELAND:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. CLEAVELAND:

I think I have to come back to that

point.

The key to the loss of revenue on the part of the

State of Maine is held by the State of Maine? it's their
credit provision, Your Honor, if the Court please.

That «—

QUESTION: Well, the fact that it's a revolving
fund, that it's a circular process, doesn't alter the fact
that it goes out of the hands of the taxpayer, does it?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

It goes out of the* hands of the

taxpayer, but again that part of it is a political question.
The State of Maine could solve that problem simply by
phrasing the issue directly, by removing that credit.
Then we would have, without question, a controversy.
QUESTION: Well, then, you'd be in much tougher
shape to sustain your tax, wouldn't you?
MR. CLEAVELAND:

No question we would fall immed­

iately into an Equal Protection problem, where we would
necessarily have to get into the business of trying to
balance the relative burden of taxation.
QUESTION:

Or Privileges land- Immunities.

MR. CLEAVELAND:

I think my contention is, in

tiie scope of this argument, that the Privileges and Immunities
and Equal Protection, in this type of case, are so closely
entangled that it's pretty much impossible to take them
apart.
QUESTION: Well, you do tax some non-residents
different from others, if they work in Vermont — in New

MR, CLEAVELAND:

If the — the principle to be

applied, Your Honor, is that the State will not — our State
will not tax a non-resident in excess of the rate which his
ovm State applies to him.,

And if that happens to create an

inequality among non-residents, I don’t think that rises to
a constitutional —
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but it has some relevance

to your argument that all you're trying to do is to equalise
the over-all tax burdens between residents of Mew Hampshire
and non-residents of New Hampshire,
If you were trying to do that, you.would tax non­
residents in the same way.
MR, CLEAVELAND:

I'm not suggesting that we are

affirmatively striving for that goal.

It's something that

has to be approximated, otherwise we have constitutional
problems,
The principal objective is to do unto the non­
resident taxpayer precisely as his State does unto him, the
option for that State then being to cease to tax our,.' own
residents.
To the extent that, for instance, the State of Maine
tries to say that our taxing their citizens at their rate is
not rational, for instance, how then do they justify taxing
New Hampshire residents at the same rate?

They, in fact, do.

48

I subruit, to the extent that the State of Maine
can justify taxing Nev/ Hampshire residents at the Maine tax
rate, and say that that is in any way a ratable contribution
to the support of government, then, to the same extent can
Mew Hampshire say that taxing Maine resident is precisely
for that purpose and to the same extent a rational basis.
