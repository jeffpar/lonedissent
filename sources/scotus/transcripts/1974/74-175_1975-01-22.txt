P R0CEEDIN6S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in 74-175 and 74-5176, Middendorf against Henry, and the
consolidated case.
Mr. Zahm, you may procee,

whenever you:’.re ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN R„ ZAHM, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF DANIEL EDWARD HENRY, ET AL.
MR. ZAHMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please:
I think it is fair to say that tbs facts of this
particular consolidated cases are simple are are not in
dispute.
The named plaintiffs were Marines stationed at
El Toro Marine Base near Los Angeles, California.

They Were

all in pay grades E-l to E-4, the lowest pay grades in the
military services, and therefore subject to summary court
martial under Article 20 of the Uniform Coda of Military
Justice? and, if convicted, they could stand confinement -they would be confined for up to thirty days.
And five of the named plaintiffs were so convicted
and sentenced to up to thirty days, respectively, for various
minor offenses.

And at their summary courts-martial, they

did not have their own retained counsel nor were they appointed
counsel.
Three of the named plaintiffs were ordered to stand

4
trial subject at the summary courts«martial.

Those trials

were not. yet convened at the time the action was brought,
but they, too, were advised that they would not have appointed
counsel at summary courts-martial.
Class action, worldwide in scope, was brought for
habeas corpus relief of the five imprisoned as a result of
the summer courts-martial convictions and sentence, and there
was a paryer for relief in the nature of mandamus also, and
for injunction against the topmost officials of the Navy and
the Marine Corps, and the named plaintiffs' commanding
officers at El Toro Marine Base, requiring the relief —
required that the accused servicemen at summary courts-martial
resulting in confinement be provided the opportunity to have
the assistance of defense counsel, who does not also rep re stmt,
the prosecution.
And in the District Court all of this requested
relief was granted.
»

QUESTION 5

You mean a member of the bar or a helper

of some kind?
MR. ZAHMs
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
You mean a member of the bar or simply

someone to help him?
MR. SAHMs

In all of this discussion, Mr. Chief

Justice, we are referring as counsel be not necessarily a
lawyer but a person who, to some degree at least, might be of

5

assistance to the accused.
QUESTION:

In other words, the "next friend'8

concept is what you’re talking about.
MR, ZAHM:

The "next friend" might be a proper

term, Your Honor, yes.
But there have been cases, which we could go into
later if the Court pleases, where the military court of the
highest nature, the United States Court of Military Appeals
has determined that, constitutionally speaking, unless Congress
has otherwise required, counsel does not mean lawyer counsel.
And so here we, in this case, are speaking of
counsel from the constitutional standpoint of being a person
who assists the accused at trial, who is not necessarily a
lawyer counsel.
At any rate, the District Court in this case
granted habeas corpus relief to those who had been confined,
and issued relief in the nature of mandamus, on a worldwide
level,
Now, the issue before this Court is, whether the
holding of this Court in Argersinger vs. Hamlin, 407 U.S.,
in the year 1972, in which, this Court held, in a landmark
decision, ‘that an accused in any criminal prosecution, for
whatever offense, petty or otherwise, may not be deprived of
his liberty if he was denied the assistance of counsel at
trial

6

And this# by virtue of the right to assistance of
counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment# and also the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

I suppose —* well# what would be your

answer to this — Suppose, instead of confinement, following
a summary court-martial of this kind# the penalty provided
was loss of pay for six months? that would be much more painful#
perhaps# than thirty days for many people# wouldn't it?
MR. ZAHMs

Your Honor, it might be more painful# we

might agree? but from the standpoint of the decision of this
Court in Argersinger# we are limited to the decision of this
Court with reference to loss of liberty,
QUESTION:

I just wanted to be sure that you were

only arguing to the Argersinger point and not any penalty #
however heavy it might be,
MR, ZAHM:

Most specifically# Your Honor# we are#

in this case# limiting ourselves to the decision of this
Court in Argersinger# with regard to loss of liberty.
Now# this question# of course# would never have
arisen with regard to any other kind of courts“martial in the
military# for the reason that the Congress of the United
States has seen to it# in the Uniform Code of Military Justice#
that in the general court-martial and the special court-martial
defense counsel shall be provided the accused.
And so the problem arises# therefore# only with

7
regard to summary court-martial.

Because, under Article 20

of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,, no provision is made
in that Article for defense counsel for the accused, such as
in the case of General Court Martial and Special Court Martial,
QUESTIONS

Mr, Zahm, —

MR, ZAHM:

Yes, Your Honor?

QUESTION;

— you say that you're confining your

argument to loss of liberty.

Can a man go to the brig as a

result of a summary court?
MR. ZAHM:

Most positively.

He may be confined

in the brig for up to thirty days, Your Honor,
And that is the problem here, that these named
plaintiffs and the hundreds of thousands of others in the
class, under summary court-martial, not only may be confined
for up to thirty days but for some, perhaps, 200 years have
been so confined.
QUESTION:

Well, he can go to the brig from a

Captain's Mast — or at least that used to be correct,
MR. ZAHM:
correct, Your Honor.

I would have to say that that is not
Under Captain's Mast, as we refer to it

in the Navy — and I am a former Navy man myself —•
Captain's Mast —
QUESTION:

That was the old Navy, at least for me.

That was the old Navy.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes.

8
[Laughter.]
MR, ZAHM:

Captain’s Mast, as we refer to it, today

is referred more technically as proceedings under Article 15,
Non-judicial administrative punishment.
Correctional custody is what might result from a
Captain's Mast, from Article 15,
QUESTION:

And on a ship at sea, doesn't that

include the power of vhe commanding officer to have the man
locked up in the brig, on reduced rations, still?
MR. ZAHM:

It would still be, even that ship at sea

would be correctional custody and not confinement.
QUESTION:

But he’s in the brig!

[Laughter. 3
QUESTION:

He’s in the brig, but he's not confined.

MR, ZAHM:

I would have to say he is not in the brig,

to my knowledge.

Correctional custody, he would still be in

the position of performing his regular duties, but tinder very
strict guidance and counseling, as the distinction is made,
to my knowledge, in the Navy,
He is not in the brig.
QUESTION;

I take it, you wouldn't want to be arguing

for counsel for people faced with that kind of custody,
correctional?
MR. ZAHM:

Well, at the present time I’m satisfied

to be arguing strictly on the matter of summary courts-

9

martial, because, as a matter of fact, I v/ill be getting to
it, the —
QUESTIONS

Mr« Zahm, having interrupted you once,

let me ask you another question that's a little confusing to
me.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Is what we're talking about here what

used to be called a deck court?
MR, ZAHM:
QUESTION:

Originally it was called a deck court —
In the Navy, at least, a deck court.

MR. ZAHM:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And a summary court, back in World War II

was quite a different thing; that was a three-officer court,
in which you did have a right to counsel.
MR, ZAHM:
QUESTION:
MR, ZAHM:

Well, my only —
In the Navy, not the Army but the Navy,
— difference would be, from an

historical standpoint, I believe by the time of World War II,

today.

QUESTION:

I mean -- yes, World War II.

MR. ZAHM:

—- we had summary court as we have it

Historically speaking, the first one-man court,

which is what a summary court is, a one-officer court, —
QUESTION: That used to be called a deck court.
MR. ZAHM:

Yes, originally.

It started in 1909,

so the concept of the one-officer court is only that old, since

10

1909.

It does not date back to the Revoluntary War period#

or the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
QUESTION:

But a summary court used to be a three-

member court.
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Originally.

Well# maybe originally# and that went

up to thirty years ago that it was.
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And in a summary court# in those days#

you had a right to counsel.
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And in a deck court# you didn't# you did

you own defense.
MR. ZAHM:

In the summary court that we refer to

today, and the one to which great objection is made in this
suit and by the authorities and by the commentators# is the
one-officer court# who is serving as the judge# as the
prosecutor# and# to some extent if at all# assistance of
defense to the accused.
QUESTION: Right,
MR„ ZAHM:

He is serving in a tripartite manner

and this is called a court, where one man is serving as the
judge, if you will# the jury# and the prosecutor.
And this Court —
QUESTION:

Maybe the problem is one of nomenclature.

11

If you vere

called an. investigator or something like that,

maybe •—.
MR. ZAHM:

Whatever the nomenclature, Your Honor,

it is a single man serving under three hats at the same time,
presuming to be a court.
QUESTION:

And, xfell, in a qu&si-invesfcigative

capacityj it's a quasi-inquisitorial proceeding, is it not?
HR. ZAHM:

No, I —

QUESTION:

I used to serve as a deck court officer,

and that's the reason I asked you.
MR, ZAHM:

Your Honor, that is not correct under

the Uniform Code of Military Justice, because a summary courtsmatial is a court, it is not an investigation, and —
QUESTION:

But you're not complaining about the

investigation, you're complaining about it •— it ends up
putting the man in the brig,
MR, ZAHM:

That is correct,

QUESTION:

That's what you're complaining of.

[Laughter.]
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:
MR, ZAIIM:

That is correct.

Conviction puts him —

Regardless of what the other two think,
Your Honor, that is precisely the point.

Whatever you call it, whatever nomenclature, it is a decision
by a court, a military court, in which, upon conviction, the
man loses his liberty, just as the civilian indigent under

12

this Court’s ruling in Argersinger loses his liberty.
Whether it be for a moment, an hour, or a day.

The result

is the same.
The question
QUESTION: Go down a notch on the scale, of what was
in my day, as I remember, called company punishment, and I
take it Justice Stewart's reference is to some sort of an
investigative thing like that, which you say you’re not
complaining about, where you can have conditions of close
confinement and supervision.

There the company commander

simply investigates — if you're there, he probably asks you
your side of the story.

And what he ends up doing is

frequently confining you to the post or something like that»
He may not put you in the stockade.
Now, there's some loss of liberty there, and yet
no one would call it a court, I don’t think.

It seems to me

your emphasis on the fact that this is a court is wide of the
mark.
I think the analysis has got to be in terms of loss
of liberty.
MR, ZAHM:

Your Honor, the United States Court of

Military Appeals has decided on this very question, the
distinction between proceedings under an Article 15 and
summary court martial, and most positively

this is the

Court, incidentally, which this Court, in Noydys. Bond, said

13

we look to for the development of military expertise.
Well, that Court, with its military expertise, sees
a tremendous significant difference between proceedings under
Article 15 and summary? for the following reasons

that

under Article 15 there is no conviction of crime, so to speak,
of military crime, on the man's record.
The explosive effects of a conviction under
summary court-martial may be drastic,,

As a matter of fact,

due to the escalator clauses that we find in the military
regulations, two convictions of summary court-martial,
when later brought up at a special court-martial, may result
very positively in a bad conduct discharge, with the result
that for the rest of the man's life, in or out of service,
he suffers a tremendous lifetime economic disability,,
None of that accrues as the result of any number,
any number, of Article 15 proceedings,
QUESTIONs

But there you're addressing yourself

now, not to the punishment but to the proceeding itself.
What if he had a summary court-martial and didn't get any
confinement?

Your complaint would be the same in terms of

your last point.
But I thought you were only arguing about a confine­
ment case, ala Argersinger?
MR. ZAHM:

Your Honor, if, as we feel this Court

should rule, making Argersinger, if you will, the requirements

14
of ArgersInger apply to the military, then the Navy would
either appoint counsel for the man in summary court-martial
or not.

If they did not, the man would not have a conviction,

you see, to confinement.
And without that, the escalator clause would not
apply to the future.
So therefore he would not suffer in that regard*
Now, the basic —
QUESTION:

Mr. Zahm, —

MR. ZAHM:

Yes, Your Honor?

QUESTION;

— as I understand it, under Article 20

of the Uniform Military Code, an enlisted-man has the privilege
of not being tried by summary court; is that correct?
MR* ZAHM:
under Article 20.

He may reject the summary court-martial
You're correct, Your Honor.

He may

reject it.
QUESTION: And then what happens to him?
MR, ZAIIM:

Then he will either have the charges

dismissed, or he will subject himself to trial court-martial,
special court-martial, or even general court-martial.

And as

a result of that, the possibilities of his punishment, of his
confinement will be tremendously greater than if he had taken
summary court-martial.
The distinction being that if he opts for the special
or the general, he will have the opportunity to have the

15
assistance of defense counsel.
QUESTION; Right.
MR, ZAIIM:

That is the difference.

QUESTION:

If he has a good defense, with the

assistance of defense counsel, presumably he'd get off.
MR. ZAHM:

That is one of the reasons, perhaps, why

he would take the greater risk, if you will, of greater
punishment, in order to get his constitutional right of the
assistance of counsel.

That would be perhaps the only basis

for his taking that risk, if you will.
What he does by not opting to reject his summary
court-martial is to feel that he does not wish to take the
risk of even greater punishment:

better I should get in the

brig for thirty days, and all the rest of the punishment that
may accrue later in life, than to have an even greater punish­
ment.
QUESTION:

You refer to the summary court as

exercising prosecutorial functions.

My reading of the

regulations indicates that the summary court has the duty to
function not as a prosecutor but as a fact-finding officer,
with an equal responsibility to safeguard the rights of the
accused and those of the government.
MR. ZAHM:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Do you differ from that general summary

of the regulations?

16

MR. ZAHM s

When we study, Your Honor , the provi­

sions of the Manual of Courts Martial, as to the functions of
the summary court officer, we find that he is to be the
prosecutor.

The language used in the Manual of Courts

Martial requires him to do the same as a trial counsel at a
general court-martial or a special court-martial, including
the obtaining of witnesses for the prosecution against the
accused, the questioning, the interrogation, the crossexamination of those witnesses, and in every sense, therefore,
he must in fact be doing what a prosecutor would be doing.
QUESTION:

But he must subpoena witnesses for the

enlisted man also?
MR. ZAHM:

He must do that»

But this is the very

problem, and the criticism of the summary court-martial that
has been extant by all authorities for many years.

He must

do all of those things.
And in the First Circuit case of Figueroa Ruis vs-»
Delgado, which is cited in the brief, the Court says — it was
a Puerto Rican District Court — points out that it is literally
impossible for a man to be a judge and function, to whatever
degree, as a prosecutor.

He just simply cannot successfully

do it.
QUESTION: Even before some of the administrative
tribunals around the country?
MR. ZAHM: Well, perhaps so, there are administrative

.17

tribunals.

Rut here we’re speaking c£ courts of law where men

are subject, upon conviction, to loss of liberty, Your Honor,
which this Court thought, in the landmark case of Argersinger,
no matter how petty the offense, he deserves the assistance
of counsel at trial.
QUESTION:

But in Argersinger, a defendant usually

was confronted with a professional prosecutor, and there is
this difference here, isn't there?

Whether it's controlling

or not is an issue, obviously: but in the Argersinger situation
the city or county prosecutor is there in court, and if you
are by yourself, you have nobody to look out for you.
But here you have a man who, by law, is required to
be impartial and to serve the interests of both sides.
MR. ZAHM:

Your Honor, Mr. Justice Powell, may I

suggest, under A-20 a summary court consists of one officer,
that’s one individual; the only other person physically in
tha courtroom therefore is the accused, obviously, and
perhaps any other witnesses who may have been called as
witnesses.
Now, somebody has to prosecute that case against
the accused.

We certainly can't expect that the accused will

be serving as the prosecutor against himself.
to be acting as prosecutor.

Somebody has

And obviously, by the very

regulations of the Manual of Courts-Martial, that is the man
who is also serving as judge, the man who will find whether

18
or not the accused is guilty or innocent»
QUESTION:

Mr. Zahm, I find your reference to the --

assume that the First Circuit supports what you say, but it
seems to me that disregards the whole course of civil law
adjudication, which we couldn't have in this country in
criminal cases, because of the guarantee of jury trial.
But you’re judged on ....

in your French courts, under ..

typical civil law.
It's just what Justice Powell says it is, itrs an
inquiry magistrate who is supposed to find out the truth, and
whereas you couldn't have it in civil proceedings here,
because of the jury trial guarantees, I'm not persuaded that
you have carried any burden of showing it basically unfair,
which you have to under the due process clause,
MR, ZAHM:

Under the due process clause, this Court

has enunciated, in Gideon vs. Wainwright, that the rule of
Betts vs, Brady, the case-by-case approach for determination
of proper due process, does not apply-in criminal prosecutions,
that the per se rule, the absolute standard of right to
counsel applies in criminal prosecutions.
Courts-martials are criminal prosecutions, and so,
following the dictates of this Court in Gideon, it would appear
that the due process rights in a summary court-martial calls
for assistance <f counsel in every case.
Now, if I may say at this juncture, this is where we

19

feel this Court should not affirm the view of the Ninth Circuit
in the Daigle case, where the due process test applied there,
differently from the test applied by the United States Court
of Military Appeals, by the Fifth Circuit in the Be tort ie vs.
Sizemore case, where the absolute standard of due process is
applied in a criminal prosecution, which means to every
accused in a summary court-martial.

This is the following of

this Court's precept as indicated in Gideon vs, Wainwright.
And since Argersinger is an extension of Gideon vs.
Wainwright, we maintain that this Court should follow, by the
way, what even the government has previously argued this term
before this Court, that the decisions, because of its special
expertise,

of the United States Court of Military Appeals

should be followed by this very Court, was an argument in a
case this term by the government.
We merely suggest that it is correct that the
decisions of the United States Court of Military Appeals
should be followed, because they know best what is needed by
the military, and they decided this issue in United States
vs p Alderman.
And in United States vs, Alderman, the maioritv of
the United States Court of Military Appeals ruled that the
requirements of Argersinger apply to the military? and I have
not yet had the opportunity to say, I would like to emphasize
that these plaintiffs recognize that military necessity, to a

20

great degree, determines whether or not the constitutional
rights of men in service are retained by those men when they
don their uniform*
QUESTION: What provisions of the Constitution define
procedural rights in military justice?
On what provisions of the Constitution relating to
military justice — there are references to it, but will you
pinpoint what it is you rely on?
HR. ZAHM:

Well, Your Honor, ever since Burns vs3

Wilson, the decision of this Court in 1953, there have been a
multitude of cases in the lower federal courts and by the
United States Court of Military Appeals, following Burns vs,
Wilson, which, in effect, say that except for those specific
exemptions from the Bill of Rights, and those that are
necessarily to be implied, all constitutional rights belong to
men in service as well as men not in service»
And the one single express exception, as this Court,
through Mr. Justice Douglas, has indicated in Parker vs. Levy,
in his dissent, the only express exception is the indictment
by a grand jury.

The only implied exception has been the

right to trial by jury.
Other than that, there is no other exception, other
than in the application of rights to the military man.
And this Court, only last term, in Parker

;s„ Levy.,

implicitly stated what I have just said, and in that Particular

21

case, with regard to First Amendment principles, this Court
said that the right of a serviceman with regard to First
Amendment has to be in some way different from that of a
civilian, because of the special needs of the military.
We recognize that*

The Wavy, allthrough the courts

in which this matter, this issue has been litigated, in the
Fifth Circuit, before the United States Court of Military
Appeals, the District Courts in Hawaii and California, and
the Ninth Circuit, has argued that military necessity requires
that there be no counsel appointed at summary courts-martial.
QUESTION:

Mr. Zahm, has the Secretary of the Navy

followed the decision in Alderman?
MR- ZAHM:

The Secretary of the Navy?

Yes, Your

Honor, —
QUESTION:

Has he issued regulations so that now

Alderman is being followed?
MR, ZAHM:

That is correct.

He did do exactly

what you ask me? in June of 1973, following the decision of
the United States Court of Military Appeals, the Navy sent
?
out an ALMAP worldwide that the decision of Alderman shall
be followed,
QUESTION: Well, Alderman was a decision of the
Military Court of Appeals, I take it, —
MR, ZAHM:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

— on the merits.

22
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is the Secretary of the Navy required to

follow that?
MR. ZAHM:

The answer to that, to my knowledge, is

yes,
QUESTION: We LI, whether he is or not, he is following
i t now?
MR. ZAHM:

And has been ever since June 1973, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: Well, what's at issue in this lawsuit,
then?
MR. ZAHM:

The issue is that the Navy wants this

Court to overrule the decision of the United States Court of
Military Appeals, which it is asking this Court to do, to
ray knowledge, for the first time in history.
QUESTION: Well, has the Secretary withdrawn his
regulations?
MR, ZAHM:
QUESTION:

He has not,
But I gather your point is, if he were

to prevail here, he probably would; is that it?
MR. ZAHM:

The supposition is, Your Honor, that if

this Court should rule contrary to the way plaintiffs here
request, that you would in effect be a/erruling the decision
of the United States Court of Military Appeals,
QUESTION:

In other words, his regulations are only

23

under the compulsion of Alderman» and that if Alderman is
reversed» he won't be under any compulsion? right?
MR. ZAHM:

That is correct» Yoi:r Honor.

May I at this point —
QUESTION:

Is that what he said» do you know? has

he said that?
MR» ZAIIM:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

Well» maybe I should ask Mr, Frey.

QUESTION:

We’ll ask the government about that.

MR. ZAIIM:

Yes.

May I point out at this juncture that when the
Argersinger decision came forth from this Court in May -excuse me» in ~ yes» in May» I think it was May or June of
1972» the Army and the Air Force» within weeks and without
anyone other than their own commands requesting it» immediately
followed the procedures as required by Argersinger.
QUESTION: Well now» Mr, Zahm» what is
present status of your clients?
MR. ZAHM:
QUESTION:
somewhere.

what’s the

Where are they?

QUESTION; Well, it seems to me they would be

entitled to relief and to retrial, or whatever it is, under
the Secretary’s regulation.
MR» ZAHM:

As my -*• as I understand it, Your Honor,

the Navy does not provide for retrial.
QUESTION? Well, what about

aren't

your clients

cannot get the benefit of the Secretary’s regulations?
MR. ZAHM:

Well, for them it was too late.

And,

as a matter of fact, I believe a number of them are already
out of service.

They either have served their time -- their

relief, if we —
QUESTION: Well, tell me just one person who, that if
you lose, is going to suffer.
MR. ZAHM:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L„ FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. FREY:

Mr, Chief Justice —

QUESTION:

Are the regulations going to be

rescinded if you win?
MR. FREY s

They are, yes „

26

Unless Congress changes the legislative structure.
QUESTION?
or

Is that something that's in your brief,

has he said that, or what?
MR, FREY:

I don’t believe it’s in the brief, but

we would not have petitioned for certiorari had he not
requested a ~~ I mean we petitioned for certiorari on behalf
of the Secretary, because the Secretary was very anxious to
have this matter clarified, and to be able to enforce the
congressional scheme for courts-martial, which he was unable
to do as a result of the Alderman decision,
QUESTION:

Was the Alderman decision made

prospective in its application only?
MR, FREY:

Well, that’s a very strange tiling.

Retroactivity was not argued in Alderman, as far as I know,
but in fact it was a retroactive decision, because the Court
of Military Appeals has no jurisdiction over summary courtsmartial, they are not reviewed into the court system.

It

has no particular expertise with respect to that special
facet of the system.
And the issue there was that enhanced punishment
had been imposed on Mr» Alderman at a subsequent special
court —
QUESTION:
MR, FREY:

Because of a prior summary conviction,
— because of a prior summary conviction.

So, in effect,they gave it — they gave Argersinger retroactive

27

effect.
And we of course take the position, and I think it's
clear from reading their opinion in Alderman,

that they did

not deal with this as military experts, they dealt with this
by reading the opinion of the Court of Appeals **«* 1 mean of
the Supreme Court in Argersinger, and concluding, quite
summarily, in the case of Judge Quinn's opinion and almost
equally summarily in the case of Judge Duncan's, that this
was binding on the Court of Military Appeals.
In fact, Judge Duncan said, as far as he was
concerned, this was a perfectly fair and reasonable procedure,
and if he were not under the force of Argersinger, he would
uphold it.
QUESTION:

But in the last portion of your brief

you ask us that even if we should decide against you on the
underlying merits, that we not make any decision retroactive;
and that's what prompted ray question was to whether the
Alderman decision itself-was retroactive.
MR. FREY:

Our interest with respect to retro­

activity is as of the date of Alderman. In other words,
our position would be that Alderman, if it was correct in
declaring that there was a right to counsel in summary
courts-martial, would be the break with the past for
retroactivity pruposes, and the Secretary complied with.
Alderman, under the force of that decision.

28

QUESTION;

From then on.

MR. FREY;

But there are -- we think that under the

Morrissey approach, that the proper standard for retroactivity
— and I didn't mean to get into this at length,, because I
trust you*11 never have to reach it ~~ but that the proper
standard would be from the date the rule was changed.
If that * s not to be the standard, there's a mare's nest of
possible retroactive problems of various consequences in
various future and past consequences, and we would suggest
that you not get into the details of what parts would be
retroactive and what parts not.
QUESTION:

Mr, Frey, Gideon was retroactive,

Ar ge ^i nge r, I think, has been made retroactive? this is a
claim of right to counsel in a criminal proceeding.
MR. FREY:

Right.

QUESTION:

Is there any really very persuasive

argument that it shouldn't be retroactive under the fairness
of fact determination?
MR. FREY:

Well, I think there is, because I think

it's clear, from Morrissey and from Wolff, that the mere fact
that the right to counsel is held to contribute to the fairness
of the proceeding substantially — after all, in Morrissey
there was a liberty interest at stake, and the Chief Justice
began by recognising that there was a substantial liberty
interest that was being affected by this action, and therefore

29
looking into the due process requirements surrounding that.
And the Court nevertheless recognized that —> it held it
prospective in Morrissey and it subsequently recognized it
in Wolff, that those kinds of rulings may be prospective.
I think it’s a judgment, and I think in part the
judgment would turn on this Court's belief as to how defective
these proceedings without counsel have been.

And I think, as

I get into my argument, I hope I'll persuade you, if our
brief hasn't already, that these are quite fair proceedings,
and that the system that Congress has devised is an
admirable one.
QUESTION:

Well, the revocation of parole is not

precisely —
B1R. FREY:
QUESTION:

Of course there's a difference «—
-- the criminal proceeding that Justice

Rehnquist was talking about.
MR, FREY:

I agree.

I think our opponents in this

case are interested in analyzing the case by label.

They

want to attach the label that says this is a criminal pro­
ceeding,. And we don't deny that this is a criminal proceeding.
And then they want to take the label "imprisonment"
and then they want to ask the Court to stop thinking about the
case any further, and proceed automatically.
Now, I suggest that it's necessary to make a pragmatic
and a functional anelysis, and to look at what's happening

30

here # and I

as I say# I think the substantial problem about

which we’re concerned is the validity of these procedures in
the first place# and the retroactivity problem is quite
a secondary one.
Now# a little over twenty years ago# in Burns v.
Wilson# this Court considered the nature, of the constitutional
protections applicable to the Military Justice System# and
thus the scope of its powers to oversee the operation of that
system in these terms.
It saids

the constitutional guarantee of due

process is meaningful enough and sufficiently adaptable to
protect soldiers as well as civilians from the crude injustices
of a trial so conducted that it becomes on fixing guilt by
dispensing with, rudimentary fairness# rather than finding
truth through adherence to those basic guarantees which have
long been recognized and honored by the military courts as
wellas the civilian courts,,
Those words are in some ways reminescent of Justice
Cardozo’s formulation of the power of this Court over Stats
courts in Pallco v, Connecticut,
Of course much has changed in our constitutional
jurisprudence since -those words were penned.

But this Court

has never stepped beyond the bounds of its self-imposed
restraints in order to strike down as unconstitutional any
provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice# or to

31

invalidate any procedure deliberately chosen by Congress for
the administration of military justice.
If the Court rules against the Navy in this
proceeding and declare invalid the congressional decision to
use the relatively informal non-adversarial procedures of a
summary court-martial, for the disposition of relatively
minor charges, it will have taken an historic step.

It will

have broken sharply with the past, and it will, I suggest,
have intruded

unjustifiably on the responsibilities of the

Congress.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Prey, do you know of any other

situation where a man is put in jail without a judicial
proceeding?
MR. FREY;

Well, we have a judicial proceeding here.

We don’t mean to suggest that — in non-judicial punishment
he may be put in the brig.
QUESTION;

Well, first let me say, if I might.

You don’t go to jail except as a result of a judicial
proceeding.
QUESTION;

If you’re arrested, you go to jail.

For a while, at least, until there’s a bail hearing or
probable-cause hearing.
MR, FREY; Well, that's true, but this is a somewhat
different matter, because this is an adjudication of a finding
that an offense has been committed? and the imposition of

32
punishment consequent to that.
QUESTION:

Well, how about in cancellation of

parole and probation?
MR, FREY:

Well, you would — you would go to jail

there without a judicial proceeding.
QUESTION:

Well, but you also -- you go to ~ you

can go to jail without counsel, tooMR. FREY:

You could.

QUESTION:

Sometimes you might have it and sometimes

you might not.
MR, FREY:

Yes, but ws don't. — we are not

advocating here the Ninth Circuit formulation in Daigle,
because we don't think it's x^orkable for summary courtsmartial.
And we think that the procedure over-all is sufficienti
fair that there is no question of — there should be no question
of requiring counsel.
QUESTION: But at least in the — I know you're not
supporting that result, but at least the -- again your argue
that probation and parole is an instance where the court says
you're not entitled to counsel every single time you might face
imprisonment.
MR. FREY: Well, that's true.

And of course in

Wolff, where the duration of your imprisonment was at stake,
you're not normally entitled to counsel.

33
QUESTION:

Mr, Daigle, you just

[Laughter. ]
— Mr. Frey, you just suggested that the government
would not support the Daigle formulation.

Do I — am I to

infer from that that if there is to be a right to counsel,
you’d rather have the forthright Argersinger than the Daigle
formulation?
MR. FREY?

Well, let me —

34

QUESTION?

Hr. Prey, may I add one more point to

my question?
Do you know of any instance where a man is put in
jail in a non-judicial proceeding from which there is no
review, any place, under any circumstances?
MR, PREY:

There is review of this proceeding.

There is administrative review of the summary court conviction.
QUESTION:
MR* FREY:
QUESTION:

Is it reviewed by a court?
No, I don't believe it is a court review.
That's right.

It’s not,

QUESTION: Well, one example would be, if your
footnote is correct on page 12 of your brief, that — what do
you call it now — an Article 15 administrative proceeding,
which we used to call Captain’s Mast, for a ship at sea
can put a man in jail for three days on bread and water, and
I think there's no review of that, is there?
MR. FREY:
QUESTION:

Yes, it could, it could do that.
Well, do you know any place else in

the Navy?
[Laughter.]
QUESTION:If the Court should conclude that the Daigle
formula were a proper one, I suppose the Navy would accommodate
to it by appointing counsel in all cases, by reason of the
workability argument,
MR. FREY:

I think that’s the way the Navy would

35

react under that.
QUESTIONS Well, except — it seems to me you're
awful reluctant about it, because if — under that formulation,
if people wanted to plead guilty, there wouldn’t have to be
cotinsel or waive of counsel,
MR» FREY:

Well, it's possible.

I can’t — this is

what the Navy tells me they feel is viable, and this is what
they’ve been doing, although they've been doing it under an
Argersinger basis, rationale from the Court of Military Appeals.
Now, much of the argument in my opponent's brief
has been directed to the proposition that summary court-martial,
as presently constituted, are not really such a good idea.
It's relied on the views expressed by Senator Ervin in
dissent to the 1968 decision to continue —
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr, Frey, may I interrupt you

MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Since Alderman and the Navy regulations

once more?

carved by Alderman, has the Navy had to staff ships at sea
with special personnel -MR. FREY:

No, Alderman does not require the pro­

vision of lawyer counsel at sea, nor is it necessary, even
in the case of a special court, and special courts are also
conducted at sea, although not with the same frequency as
summary courts are.

36
QUESTION:

Yes. Well, are there special — I'm

interested, that apparently the Army and the Air Force have
acted as though they were bound by Argersinger and provide
counsel in comparable proceedings.

What's the special

problem about the Navy, if it’s not applicable to use at sea?
MR» FREY:

Well, I don't — I think that the Array

acquiesced, and I think they may be now reluctant about it,
but they did acquiesce in the view.

They read Argersinger as

being applicable.
Now,the degree of sophistication of their analysis
at the time they issued that, I can't speak to,
QUESTION:
MR, FREY:

Was that true of the Air Force, too?
The Air Force made very little use of

summary courts, and I think the character, the nature of the
personnel in the Air Forca are somewhat different .in terms of
levels of education and so on -(Laughter. 3
MR. FREY:

— that it affects the utility of, or

the need for the summary court as a device for maintaining
discipline,
QUESTION:

Did Alderman say it was not applicable to

ships at sea?
MR* FREY:
exception.

They recognised that there could be an

Because lawyer counsel —> what happens in summary

courts that are still conducted at sea is that sometimes they

37
are on an aircraft carrier/ which is practically a traveling
city, and which may have two attorneys on it, in which case
lawyer counsel would he provided.

But, if not, they'd pro™

vide an officer to serve a counsel who is not a lawyer.
By the way, no one is prevented from having, as
far as I know, counsel of his choice, that is, by having a
friend, his warrant officer, come and help him in a summary
court proceeding.

Even now, he is not required to go into

the proceeding alone.
Now, there's been a suggestion that you wouldn't
be declaring a statute unconstitutional if you ruled against
the Navy's position in this case.

And while in some

technical sense it's true, the Congress hasn't prohibited the
use of counsel in summary courts, I think that this Court
should make no mistake about concluding that a declaration of
invalidity of the summary court procedure would represent an
exercise of the Court's constitutional veto over the powers
of Congress.
QUESTION;

It wouldn't say that you couldn't

hold it, but said that you could hold it with counsel.
MR„ FREY;

Well, you would say that the

Constitution did not permit it to be held the way the Congress
planned for it to be held, and it's quite clear, if you look
at Article 27 of the —
QUESTION: Well, does it say specifically that he

38

can't have counsel?
MR. FREY:

Ho# I was just saying it does not say

that it can11 have counsel —
QUESTION: That's right.
MR. FREY:

— but there is no doubt that Congress#

which is supposed to provide for.the administration of military
justice, deliberately selected a system in which summary
courts would not entail the provision of counsel0

And if

you look at Article 27# which deals with the provision of
counsel in special and general courts, it's clear that this
was a carefully thought-out# deliberate decision of Congress»
Now, the framework of analysis for a case of this
sort, we suggest, is found in the Court's recent decision in
Parker y. Levy.
Now, the Court there recognized the important
differences between the military and the civilian community#
and the differences in their criminal justice systems that
flowed from that.
These differences derive in large part from the
special relationship of the government to its servicemen and
■fie vastly greater proportion of the serviceman’s life that's
subject to regulation.
And# in light of this, the Court held# in Parker v.
Levy, for the reasons which differentiate military society
from civilian society — and I'm quoting from page 21 of the

39

slip opinion — we think Congress is permitted to legislate
both with greater breadth and with greater flexibility when
prescribing the rules by which the former — that is the
military society ~~ shall be governed, than when it is when
prescribing the rules for the latter.
It then went on to say, at page 23s

The fundamental

necessity for obedience and the consequent necessity for the
imposition of discipline may render permissible within the
military that which would be constitutionally impermissible
outside of it.
Against this background, I would like the Court now
to consider the role that the summary court-martial plays
in the system that Congress has established for the administration of military justice.
The system is a flexible one? as you've read, I'm
sure, there are four levels which are designed to deal with
the broad range of offenses.
The most minor disciplinary infractions are dealt
with the most informally in a proceeding that is quite limited,
and the punishments that can be imposed.
The most grave are dealt with in proceedings of
considerable formality, with substantial procedural
protections and potent penalties available.

That is, the

general court-martial,
Now, this Court recognized in Parker v. Levy that

40

the Article 3.5 proceeding, which imposes punishments which,
in most respects, are similar to the punishments at summary
court, but which do not include confinement at hard labor,
that that partook, in many ways, of the aspects of a laborrelations matter between an employee and an employee.
Well, here, while it's true that we have a criminal
proceeding, it's also true that the summary court, the next
step up in the scale, partakes very much of these same
factors.
It’s frequently used for — it can be used for the
same kind of offenses for which non»judicial punishment under
Article 15 could be employed, or forwhich a special court
could be convened.

Part of the judgment that would go into

the decision to invoke a summary court would be, for instance,
that this particular individual had committed the same
offenses several times, he had been punished under Article 15,
he was not responding to discipline, and it was necessary to
step up a little the degree of punishment that could be
imposed on him in an effort to generate obedience and
discipline, on his part.
QUESTION;

Who decides this?

And any of those can be on shipboard.

QUESTION:
MR, FREY:

QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But beyond that, for a general court,

it has to b© somewhere else.

Right?

MR, FREY:

I think that’s right.

QUESTION;

It used to be.

MR, FREY:

Now, on shore, the sailor could reject

either an Article 15, and he could reject the summary court,
he could insist on the more formal judicial proceeding, the
next step up the scale.
QUESTION:

How about at sea?

You say that could

be done ashore? are you implying that it cannot be done at
sea?
MR. FREY:

At sea they can reject summary court,

but they cannot reject Article 15 punishment.
That’s the special exception that has been drawn.
I think for reasons that are traditional with the
Navy, in terms of authority of the captain, which is even

42
greater than the authority of other commanding officers in
the service under other circumstances.
QUESTION:
MR,j FREY;

Of a ship at sea?
Of a ship at sea, yes.

Now, the summary court-martials are mostly for
military types of offenses.

Still these are the vast bulk —

I think it was 86 percent, according to the table we have in
our brief? are offenses that would not be offenses in civilian
life at all.

The majority of them are unauthorized absence?

also disobeying an order? disrespect to a superior officer,
and so on.
There are substantial procedural differences.

We’ve

shown in our brief that the summary court-martial takes about
— before Alderman took about 33 days.

Special courts take

somewhere on the order of two to three times as long, from
charge to disposition.
There are, it seems to me, clear reasons why the
Navy would prefer not to use a special court if it didn't
feel that such severe punishments were necessary to deal with
the particular offense.
Now, if this Court's decision substantially alters
and impairs the utility, the flexibility of the summary courtmartial, then the carefully balanced structure of graduated
procedures and penalties established by Congress will be
itself impaired, and its character substantially altered.

43

,

These consequences way, of course be constitutionally
compelled, and they would be if the Court concludes that the
use of non-advers arial procedures comes anywhere close —
harking back to the Burns v, Wilson language — to, quote,
"the crude injustices of a trial so conducted that it becomes
bent on fixing guilt by dispensing with rudimentary fairness."
We don't think these words are even remotely
applicable to the summary court procedure.
In answering the constitutional inquiry that you
have before you, there are three factors to be considered:
First, the fairness of the procedures as a means of
adjudicating guilt and imposing punishment for relatively
minor infractions.
Second, a consideration of what is at stake for the
individual in the proceeding.

In other words, what’s the

potential impact, of a mistake, on his life?
Thirdly, what are the governmental interests that
are served by the procedure.
And I’d like to consider that last factor first.
The principal consideration that I think is
important to the services, in the use of the summary courtmartial, is speed of disposition.
back on the job swiftly.

They want to get the man

They want to impose punishment

swiftly, to maximize the deterrent or corrective effect of the
punishment.

And I think it's well-recognized that a small

44

punishment, swiftly imposed, is frequently much more
effective as a means of correcting behavior than a larger
punishment substantially delayed,
Nov?, if you would look at the table on page 26 of our
brief, you will see that what has happened since the first
period, that is January 1 through June 30th of 1973, was
largely pre-Alderman# counsel were generally not provided
during most of that period.
The two subsequent periods were post-Alderman, and
counsel was provided.

And the time of disposition increased

from 33 and a half days, approximately, to -- we have now a
corrected figure, on the basis of final figures that were not
available at the time we did the brief — 43.62 days for the
first half of calendar 1974.
Now, in their brief, my opponents have suggested that
the increase in acquittal rates is a product of the provision
of counsel, and that this increase is as much as 32 percent
more acquittals.
Now, I'm willing, for purposes of driving home a point,
which I think is very important for this Court to consider, to
accept the proposition — although I'm not sure that it's
scientifically valid — that the increase in . acquittals is
due to the presence of counsel.
Now, if you will compute the effect of that —» that
is, if you will assume that the 4,9 percent acquittal rate

45
during the pre-Alderman period is the rate of acquittals that
would have occurred without counsel, you will find that out
of about 3800 cases there would have been approximately 80
people who were acquitted with counsel, who would not have
been acquitted without counsel.

About 80 people out of 8800

cases.
How, in exchange,however, if you will attribute the
increased time, and I’m not saying that this is precisely
correct, but I think that the major component in the increased
time that it takes to try these cases is the presence of
counsel, you will find that there are approximately 80,000
man-days of additional time with people having charges
hanging over their head undisposed, as a result of counsel.
So, in other words — and I don’t mean to minimise
the importance to the 80 people who would have been
convicted had they not had lawyers — the significance to the
Navy and to these people is 80,000 man-days of people with
charges hanging over their heads, people who can't be assigned
on mission, and some of these people innocent, with charges
hanging over their heads.
Now, turning to the considerations of fairness,
we think there are significant differences in terms of the
fairness of the procedure, as compared to the civilian
procedures that this Court was considering in Argersinger.
I think one was brought out in the questioning of

45
Mr. Zahm, and it’s a central one.

They

Sometimes in police courts,

police officers presented the case. But even there it was
somebody that was experienced in court, who knew what he was
doing.
The inquisitorial system of justice is not so
fundamentally unfair, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, that
it can't be used for substantial aspects of the criminal
justice system in many European countries.
Also, the criminal justice system in the military is
not burdened with the

kinds of backlogs that cause the court

concern in Argersinger;~ the rush to judgment, that was a worry
in Argersinger, we believe is clearly not a concern in this
area.
And even in terms of impact on the individual,
while I don't wish to minimise it, it is simply not as great
as it is in civilian life.
For instance, employment consequences, immediate
employment consequences.

A man in the Navy, who's convicted

at a summary court-martial and goes to the brig for three
weeks or thirty days, he has a job when he gets out.

He can

still get an honorable discharge from the Navy if the rest of
his record is good.

On the otheir hand, a man who gets thirty days in
jail as a civilian may very well not have a job waiting*

MR, PREY:

And also if he's a sailor*

judicial punishment on board ship for up to three days,
I don't know whether reduced rations is a penalty that can
be imposed under a summary court.

I don't think so,

QUESTION:

I don't think it can any more,

MR, FREY*

It's the same — the same amount of

reduced rations for non-judicial punishment.

Yes, but not bread and water.

MR, FREY:

Bread and water for a limited period of

time can be imposed in both non-judicial punishment and
court-martial.
QUESTION:

But I still — you still admit that this

is a judicial proceeding?
And I'm not just getting the words there.
MR. FREY:

Yes.

The summary court is a judicial

proceeding. That is the distinction that the Navy makes.

But

we believe, and we urge this Court to recognize, that Congress
can say to itself:

We're going to have a judicial proceeding
