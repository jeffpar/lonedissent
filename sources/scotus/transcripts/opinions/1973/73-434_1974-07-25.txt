MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I have the disposition

to announce for the Court in No. 73-434, Mi Hi ken against
Bradley, along with 73-435 and 436, Allen Park Public Schools
against Bradley, and Grosse Points Public School System
against Bradley.
The respondents in these cases brought this class
action alleging that the Detroit public school system was
racially segregated as a result of the official policies and
actions of the petitioner State and city officials.

They

sought implementation of a plan to eliminate the segregation
in Detroit and establish a unitary non-racial school system
in tliat city.
The District Court concluded that various acts by
the petitioner, the Detroit School Board of Education, had
created and perpetuated school segregation in Detroit.

When

the District Court turns the question of an appropriate
remedy for the Detroit segregation that it had found, it
proceeded to order the Detroit Board of Education to submit
plans dealing with the segregation problems found to exist
in that city, which of course was what the lawsuit was all
about.
At the same time, however, the State defendants were
directed by the District Court to submit desegregation plans
that would include the three-county metropolitan area, covering

a total of 1952 square miles.

Despite the fact that the

school districts of these three counties were not parties to
the action, and despite the fact that there had been no claim
up to that tine made by anyone that these outlying counties,
that included 85 separate school districts, had committed any
constitutional violations cf any kind.
The outlying school districts were then allowed to
intervene, that by -the express terras of the order of the
District Court they were not permitted to assert any claim or
defense on issues previously decided, or to reopen any issixe
previously decided.

They were allowed simply to advise the

Court as to the propriety cf a metropolitan plan and to submit
any modifications or alternatives to such plan.
Without taking any evidence on the subject, the
District Court then ruled that it was proper to consider
metropolitan plans, including 53 of the 80™odd outlying
school districts, and within a few days after that the Judge
filed his decision, holding that it was proper for the court to
consider metropolitan plans directed toward the desegregation
of the Detroit public schools as an alternative to -the Detroitonly plans which were then before the court.
The District Court then issued its findings and
conclusions on the three alternative Detroit-only plans
submitted by the city school boards and by the respondents,
and found that the best of these three, as the court viewed the

one to be the best, would make the Detroit system identifiably
Negro, -thereby — and I use the terms of the District Judges
nov/ -""thereby increasing the flight of the whites from the city
and from the system»"
From this, the District Court concluded that the
Detroit-only plan would not accomplish desegregation within
the corporate geographical limits of the City of Detroit»
Accordingly, the District Court held that it was required to
look beyond the limits of the Detroit school district for a
solution to the problem, as it saw the problem.
And here I use his words again, "because the school
district lines are simply matters of political convenience and
may not be used to deny constitutional rights,"
The District Court then issued its ruling on the de­
segregation area, and the related findings and conclusions.
The District Judge acknowledged at the outset that he had
taken no evidence with respect to the establishment of the
boundaries of the 85 school districts surrounding, or at least
near Detroit itself.

Nor had he taken any evidence on the

issue of whether these outlying school districts had committed
any acts of de jure segregation.
Nevertheless, the District Court then carved out 53
of the 85 suburban school districts, plus Detroit, and held
that this was to become the metropolitan desegregation area.
The District Court then appointed a panel to prepare

6

and submit what he described as an effective desegregation, plan
for the Detroit schools that would include the entire desegrega­
tion area, with a total of 53 school districts.
The Court ordered the Detroit Board of Education to
purchase or otherwise acquire at least 295 school buses for the
purpose of providing the necessary transportation, under an
interim plan that was to be developed immediately, or promptly
at least, for the 1972-73 school year.
The costs of the acquisition of these 295 or more
buses was to be borne by the State.
When the case went to the Court of Appeals, that
Court affirmed in part and held that the record supported the
District Court’s finding as to the constitutional violations
committed by the Detroit Board and the State officials.

That,

■therefore, the District Court was authorised and permitted to
take effective measures to desegregate the Detroit school
system, and that a metropolitan area plan embracing the 53
outlying school districts was the only feasible solution, and
was within the District Court’s equity powers.
But the Court having thus decided the case, or at
least these issues, remanded to the District Court so that all
the suburban school districts that might be affected by a
metropolitan remedy could be made parties to the lawsuit, and
have an opportunity to be heard as to the scope and the imple­
mentation of the remedy

It vacated the order as to the acquisition of
additional buses, subject to this being reimposed at an
appropriate later time when and if that became necessary,.
However, it is clear that the case ivas decided before
these 53 districts were given any chance to show that they had
committed no violations of anyone's constitutional rights»
We granted certiorari to determine whether a federal
court may impose a multi-district or interdistrict areawide
remedy to cure the segregation of one district, and to do so
without any finding that the other .included school districts
failed to operate a totally unitary system within their
districts, without any claim or finding that the boundary
lines of any affected school district were established with
the purpose of fostering racial segregation in the public
schools, without .any finding that the included districts had.
committed acts which effected segregation 'within the other
districts, and without any meaningful opportunity for the
included neighboring outlying school districts to present
evidence or to be heard on the propriety of a multi-district
remedy or on the question of constitutional violations by
those neighboring districts affecting the primary district.
Ever since Drown jr. The Board of Education, twenty
years ago, judicial consideration of school desegregation cases
has begun with the standard stated in that case, that in the
field of public education the doctrine of separate-but-equal

8

has no place, separate educational facilities are inherently
unequal.

And. this has been reaffirmed in this Court time and

again, as the meaning of the Constitution and the controlling
rule of law.
The target of the Brown holding was clear and
forthright?

The elimination of State-mandated or deliberately

maintained dual school systems, with certain schools for
Negro pupils and others for white pupils.
In further refining the remedial process, a unanimous
Court held in Swann y. Charlotte--Mecklenburg Board of Education
in 197.1 that the task is to correct the condition that offends
the Constitution, a federal remedial power may be exercised,
we said in that case, only on the basis of a constitutional
violation? arid, as with any equity case —- and these are the
words of that holding — the nature of the violation determines
the scope of the remedy.
Proceeding from these basic principles, we note, first,
that in the District Court the complainants sought a remedy
aimed at the condition alleged to offend the Constitution.
That condition was just one thing;
Detroit city schools.

the segregation within

And the Court found that it did exist.

And that finding is not challenged here.
Thereafter, however, the District Court abruptly
rejected the proposed Detroit-only plans on the ground that
while it v/euld provide a racial mix more in keeping with the

9

Hegro/v/hite proportion of the student population, it would
accentuate the racial identifiability of the Detroit district
as a Negro school system, and it would not accomplish
desegregation„
Viewing the record as a whole, it seems clear to us
that the District Court and the Court of Appeals shifted the
primary focus from a Detroit remedy to the metropolitan area
remedy only because of their conclusion that the total
desegregation of the Detroit school system would not produce
the kind of racial balance which they considered desirable.
Both Courts proceeded on an assumption that the
Detroit schools could not be desegregated, in their view of
what constituted desegregation, unless the racial composition
of the student body of each school substantially reflected
the racial composition of the population of the metropolitan
area as a whole.
That this was in fact and realistically the approach
of the District Court is shown by the order which expressed the
Court’s view of the constitutional standard that should be
followed.

Here is what the District Judge said in part in his

decision?

"Pupil reassignments shall be effected within the

clusters described in Exhibit P.M. 12 so as to achieve the
greatest degree of actual desegregation to the end that, upon
implementation, no school, grade or classroom will be sub­
stantially disproportionate to the over-all pupil racial

10
composition."
In doing this, the District Court was using a
racial head-count, not simply as a starting point, as was
suggested in the Swann case, but as the objective of consoli­
dating the 53 outlying districts with the Detroit School
District.
In the Swann case in 1971, which arose in the context
of a single independent school district, we held, in language
that seems to be quite clear, and I use the Court's language
in that case, "if we were to read the holding of the District
Court to require as a matter of substantive constitutional
right, any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that
approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged to
reverse."
The clear import of that language from Swann is that
desegregation, in the sense of dismantling a dual school system,
does not require any particular racial balance in each school
or glass or grade.
Here, moreover, the District Court’s approach to what
constituted "actual desegregation" raises the fundamental
question, not presented in the Swarm case, as to -the circumstances in which a federal court may order desegregation relief
that embraces more than a single school district.
The controlling principle consistently expounded in
the holdings of this Court is that the scope of the remedy is

11
determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional
violation.
Substantial local control of public education in
this country is a deeply rooted tradition.

Before the

boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be
set aside, and they may be in some circumstances, by
consolidating the separate school units for remedial purposes,,
or by imposing a cross or interdistrict remedy, there must
first be evidence that there has been a constitutional viola­
tion within one district that produces significant segregated
effect in another district.
Specifically, it must be shown that racially
discriminatory acts of the State or local school districts or
of a single school district caused racial segregation in an
adjacent district, or where district lines have been
deliberately drawn on the basis of race, in those circumstances
an interdistrict remedy would be an appropriate remedy for
the Court to consider, to eliminate the interdistrict
segregation directly caused by the constitutional violation.
On the other hand, without an interdistrict violation
and some interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong
and there is no constitutional basis for an interdistrict
remedy.
The record before us in this case is very voluminous,
that it contains no evidence of de jure segregated conditions,

12
except in the Detroit schools.

That, of course, was the theory

on which the lawsuit was initially brought, and the only subject
on which the District Court took any evidence.

With no

showing of significant violations by file 53 outlying school
districts, and no evidence of any interdistrict violation or
effect, tiie Court, as I have already suggested, went beyond
the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings and
ordered a 54~district metropolitan area remedy.

The 54

districts including Detroit and the 53 outlying districts.
To approve the remedy ordered by the Court in these
circumstances would impose on the 53 outlying districts not
shown to have committed any constitutional violation a wholly
impermissible remedy, and one based on a standard not even
hinted at in Brown I or Brown II or in any holding of tills
Court since those cases.
Indeed, it. was based on a standard we expressly said
was improper in the Swann case only three years ago.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
so that the segregation already found by the District Court
to exist in Detroit can be promptly corrected.
Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a concurring opinion.
Justices Douglas, Brennan, White, and Marshall have
filed, or joined, in dissenting opinions that will now be
announced.

13

Mr. Justice Brennan.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAM-s
Douglas

„

In the absence of Mr. Justice

1 announce on his behalf a dissenting opinion that he

has filed.
In pertinent part, the dissent reads as follows:
The Court today denies the District Court authority
to fashion a metropolitan remedy.

Yet metropolitan treatment

of metropolitan problems is commonplace.

If this were a

sewage problem or a water problem or an energy problem, there
can be no doubt that Michigan would stay well within federal
constitutional bounds if she sought a metropolitan remedy.
In the Richmond School case, affirmed last year by
an equally divided Court, we had a case involving the Virginia
school system, where local school boards had 15exclusive
jurisdiction” of the problem, not "the State Board of
Education"„
Michigan is very different.

Here the Michigan

educational system is unitary, heading up in the legislature
under which is the State Board of Education.

The State

controls the boundaries of school districts.

The State

supervised school site selection.

The construction was done-

through municipal bonds approved by several State agencies.
Education in Michigan is a State project, with very little
completely local control, except that the schools are
financed locally, not on a Statewide basis.

14
When we rule against the metropolitan area remedy,
we take a step backward that will likely put the problems of
the blacks and our society back to the period that antedated
the "separate but equal" regime of Plessy v. Ferguson.

The

reason is simple»
The inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly
black, and the blacks, we know, in many instances are likely to
be poorer, just as were the Chicanes in San Antonio v.
Rodriguez, decided last year.

Under -the Rodriguez decision

the poorer school districts must pay their own way.

It is

therefore a foregone conclusion that we have now given the
States a formula whereby the poor must pay their own way.
Today's decision given Rodriguez means that there is
no violation of the Equal Protection Clause though the schools
are segregated by race and though the black schools are not
only "separate" but "inferior".
So far as equal protection is concerned we are now in
a dramatic retreat from the B-to-l decision in 1896 in
assy v. Ferguson that blacks could be segregated in public
facilities provided they received equal treatment.
There is, so far as the school cases go,

no

constitutional difference betxveen de facto and de jure
segregation.

Each school board performs State action for

Fourteenth. Amendment purposes when it. draws the lines that
confine it to a given area, when it builds schools at

.15

particular sites» or when it allocates students.

The creation

of the school districts in Metropolitan Detroit either main­
tained existing segregation or caused additional segregation.
Restrictive covenants maintained by State action or inaction
build black ghettos.
It is State action when public funds are dispensed by
housing agencies to build racial ghettos.

Where a community

is racially mixed and school authorities segregate schools»
or assign black teachers to black schools or close schools
in fringe areas and build new schools in black areas and in
more distant white areas» the State creates and nurtures a
segregated school system» just as surely as did those States
involved in Brown

Board of Education» when they maintained

dual school systems.
All these conditions and more were found by the
District Court to exist.

The issue is not whether there should

be racial balance» but whether the State’s use of various
devices that end up with black schools and white schools
brought the Equal Protection Clause into effect.

Given the

State’s control over the educational system in Michigan» the
“fact that the black schools are in one district and the white
schools are in another is not controlling — either constitu­
tionally or equitably.

No specific plan has yat been adopted.

We are still at an interlocutory stage of a long drawn-out
judicial effort at school desegregation.

16

It is conceivable that ghettos develop on their own
without any hint of State action*

But. since Michigan, by one

device or another, has, over the years, created black school
districts and white school districts, the task of equity is to
provide a unitary system for the affected area where, as here,
the State washes its hands of its own creations.
In my view, concludes Mr. Justice Douglas, the Court
of Appeals has acted responsibly in 'these casas and we should
affirm its judgment.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

In Brown vs. Board of Education,

this Court held that segregation of children in public schools
on the basis of race deprives Negro children of equal
educational opportunities and therefore denies them the equal
protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.
This Court recognised then that remedying decades of
segregation would not he an easy task.

Subsequent events,

unfortunately, have seen that prediction bear bitter fruit.
But however imbedded old ways, however ingrained old prejudices,
this Court has not been diverted from its appointed task

of

making "a living truth” of our constitutional ideal of' equal
justice under law.
After twenty years of small, often difficult steps
toward that great end, the Court today takes a giant step
backwards.
Therefore I have filed a dissenting opinion, joined

17

by Justices Douglas, Brennan, and White. *
The record in this case shows that there have been
widespread and pervasive racial segregation in the school
system provided by the State of Michigan for children living
in Detroit.

The Detroit School Board consciously drew school

attendance zones along lines which maximized the segregation
of races in their schools.

It deliberately created optional

attendance zones for neighborhoods undergoing racial
transition, so as to allow whites in those areas to escape
integration.
Negro students in areas with overcrowded schools were
transported past closer white schools with available space to
more distant Negro schools.
These and other techniques used in Detroit were
typical of methods employed to segregate students by race in
areas where no statutory dual system of education ever existed.
While it is true that most of the acts of segregation
in this case, though by no means all, were committed by the
Detroit Board of Education, it is clear that the obligation to
remedy these constitutional violations rests ultimately with
the State.

The command of the Fourteenth Amendment is that

no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction
equal protection of the law.

And the actions of State

agencies, like school boards, are, in law, the acts of the
State,

It is thus -the State which bears the responsibility

18
under Brown for affording a non-discriminatory system of
education.
The State is ordinarily free to choose any de~
centralized framework for education it wishes,, but it should
not be allowed to hide behind its delegation and compartmentalization of school districts to avoid its constitutional
obligation to its citizens.

Vesting responsibility with 'the

State of Michigan for Detroit segregated schools is particularly
appropriate here, for, as in Michigan, unlike some other States,
Michigan operates a single Statewide system of education
rather than several separate and independent school systems.
The majority's emphasis on local governmental
control and local autonomy of school districts in Michigan
will come as a surprise to those with any familiarity at all
with that State's system of education.

School districts are

not separate and distinct sovereign entities under the Michigan
law, but are, rather, by the decisions of its highest court,
quote, "auxiliaries of the State", end quote, and subject to,
quote, "its absolute power", end quote.
The courts in the State have repeatedly emphasized
that education in Michigan is not a local governmental
concern, but a truly State function.

Yet the Court today

holds that the District Court was powerless to require the
State to remedy its constitutional violations in any meaning­
ful fashion.

19
Our prior cases have not minced words as to what
steps responsible officials and agencies must take in order to
remedy segregation in public schools.

Whereas, here, State-

imposed segregation has been demonstrated, it becomes the duty
of the State to eliminate, root and branch, all vestiges
of racial discrimination.
As was said in Swann v. Charlotte-Meeklenburg, where
de jure segregation is shown, authorities must make, quote,
"every effort to achieve tire greatest possible degree of
actual desegregation”, end quote.
If these words have any meaning at all, surely it is
that State school authorities must take all practical steps to
insure that Negro and white children in fact do go to school
together.
In the final analysis, this is what segregation of
public schools is all about.
But a Detroit-only decree, the only remedy permitted
under today's decision, cannot effectively desegregate the
city schools in Detroit.

The Detroit school system has in

recent years increasingly become an all-Negro school system,
with the greatest increejse in the proportion of Negrot students
of many major northern cities.
Moreover, the result of a Detroit-only decree from
this Court would be to increase the flight of whites from the
city to the outlying suburbs, compounding the effects of the

20

present rate of increase in the proportion of Negro students
in the Detroit system.
Thus, even if a plan were adapted which, at its
outset, provided in every school a 65-Negro/35-white racial
balance mix, iri keeping with the Negro/white population of
the total school population, such a system would in short order
devolve into an all-Negro system.
For these reasons, the Detroit-only plan simply has
no hope of achieving actual desegregation.
Under such a plan, white and Negro students will not
go to school together? instead Negro children will continue to
attend all-Negro schools.

The very evil, that Brown was aimed

at will not be cured but will be perpetuated.
The rights at issue in this case are too fundamental
to be abridged on the grounds as superficial as those relied
on by the majority opinion today.
We deal hare with the rights of all of our children,
whatever their race, their right to an equal start in life,
to an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as
citizens.
The children who have been denied that right in the
past deserve better than to see fences thrown up to deny them
the right in the future.

Our nation, 1 fear, will be ill-

served by this Court's refusal to remedy separate and unequal
education, for unless our children begin to learn together,

21

there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live
together and understand each other.
Desegregation is not and was never expected to be an
easy task.

Racial attitudes ingrained in our nation's child™

hood and adolescence are not, quickly thrown aside in its middle
years.
But just as the inconvenience of soma cannot be
allowed to stand in the way of the right of others, so public
opposition, no matter how strident, cannot be permitted to
divert this Court from the enforcement of the constitutional
principles at issue in this case.
Today's holding, in my view, is more a reflection of
a perceived public mood that we have gone far enough in
enforcing the constitutional guarantee of equal justice and
is idle product of neutral principles of lav;.
In the short run, it may seem to be the easier course
to allow our metropolitan areas to be divided up into two
cities, one white, the other black? but it is a course, I
predict, our people will ultimately regret.
And for these reasons, I respectfully dissent,
I also wish to announce that Mr. Justice White has
filed a separate dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Douglas,
Breannan, and myself.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Marshall.
