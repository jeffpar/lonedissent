This case is here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit

Exectric Auto-Lite Company and they sue derivatively and as a

13

shareholders of Auto-Lite in 1963.

all other minority shareholders with

As the action is brought against Auto-Lite for whose

15

benefit it is sought, against Merganthaler, the majority share­

16

holder, which owns 54 percent of Auto-Lite stock, and arrainst

17

American Manufacturing Company, a parent of Mergenthaler and

18
19
20
21

22
23

24
25

owner of one-third of its stock.
■The story begins about two years earlier when the
American Manufacruring Company, the top of the pyramid, found
itself in a legal situation where presumptively, all of the
transactions between its affiliates, Mergenthaler and Auto-Lite
and itself or any of them, had to be subject, possibly, to
Investment Company Act scrutiny and regulation.

This regulation

in substantive terms, posed some very serioxis problems and to
2

1

avoid the risks of this kind of regulation, an application was

2

made to the Corporate Regulation Division of the Securities and

3

Exchange Commission for an exemption under a provision which

4

permits such an exemption if it can be shown that the business

5

of the parent is not that of an investment company, but it is

6

primarily engaged in a business other than that of owning

7

stocks through controlled subsidiaries.

8
9

To show that American was primarily engaged in the
operation of Auto-Lite and its business on a dav-to-ciav basis,

10

Respondents offered evidence of the fact that Mergenthaler

11

actually dominated the day-to-day business of Auto-Lite and

12

that this was done in cooperation with American and that this

13

domination occurred through the fact that, all of the directors

14

— all of the directors -- of Auto-Lite had been hand-picked.

15

Seven of them were hand-picked by "fergenthaler; seven of them

16

were direct nominees and four of them had been retained at

17

sufferance and as the testimony went there, for the benefit of

18

dergenthaier; not for the benefit of Auto-Lite, as they out it.

19

On this showing they obtained the exemption order.

20

And hard on the heels of this exemption order they issued the

21

proxy statement with regard to the proposed merger, between

22

Mercfenthaler and Auto-Lite.

23

The proxy statement was completely silent about this

24

domination of the board of directors.

25

pletely silent as to any relationship between the hoard of

In fact, it was com­

directors of Auto-Lite and ^ergenthaler and. American, and

2

although conscious of the fact that it was necessary to dis-

3

close such relationships, they did disclose that there we-e

4

four directors of Auto-Lite who were common to Bergenthaler:

5

and went on to make the positive representation that no direc­

6

tor has any other interest, direct or indirect in the proposed

7

merger.

j
I

8

In. the Complaint the Plaintiffs claimed that this

v

was an out-and-out misrepresentation.

It was certainly a major

'IO

nondisclosure.

n

directors has carefully considered and approved the terms of

12

the merger and recommends that the shareholders vote to approve

13

the plan of merger."

14

The proxy statement did say that "The board of

Respondents, despite the fact that the suit was

15

pending, proceeded to consummate the merger and this puts our

18

.V
<
situation here in exactly the same context as the situation in

17

Borak versus J. I. Case, which this Court decided in 19G4, and

18

which we say is determinative of the issues here, because there,

19

too, the merger was consummated; the people

20

decided to go ahead knowing there was a lawsuit pending, but

21

nevertheless went ahead with knowledge of what the claims of

.22

the Plaintiffs were.

2.3

took the risk,

Since the facts are undisputed because we had these

24

sworn statements from the other case, the pistrict Court took

25

the view that the shareholders were entitled to be informed of •

4

i

these interrelationships between the hoard of directors making

z

the recommendations and the adversary in the mercer negotiation;

3

and entered judgment — a summary judgment under Rule 56-C of

4

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is appropriate

5

where there are no genuina issues of fact that there had been

6

a violation through nondisclosure of a material fact or facts»
The Court reserved, however

7
8
9

brought

up

the

question of causal relationship, and after hearings were had onj
f
the casual relationship and it was demonstrated to the Court

'10

that this merger* was consummated through the use of proxies

11

procured through the unlawful proxy statement, the Court then

12

made a further finding and entered a supplemental summary ju&g-l

13

menfc holding that the issue of liability had been established

14

and that there was a violation of the Act.

j

The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court

15

16

on the fact that there was this material nondisclosure. Both

17

Courts had little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that

18

the failure to disclose this conflict of interest, the relation­

19

ship with the adversary, was so material that a violation had

20

occurred, so the Court of Appeals, in a very carefully con­

21

sidered opinion, ’ruled that there had been this violation of

22

Section 14-A and Rule 14 of the regulations promulgated by the

23

SEC.,

'
. j

24
25

The District Court reserved all questions of relief
for further hearing.

Under the summary judgment proceedings,
5

.

i

it is permissible to have a judgment on liability first and

2

then after, that is disposed of.

of course, came immediately after the District Court's ruling

and finding.
Since the Court of Appeals found that there had beenj

6

a violation and the fact not disclosed was material, the

7

Respondents here filed no petition for certiorari and did net

8

seek to save that question for review by this Court.

9

Petitioners filed a petition, the Respondents resisted our

When

10

petition, filed no cross-petition, and we believe that that

11

matter is therefore not pending before this Court.

12

13

Now, this Court requested the Government to file a
brief as Amicus and the Government in its brief, as will be

14

noted, agrees with Petitioners’ view as to what issues are

15

pending on this certiorari hearing and theirs are essentially

16

the same as ours — that is, the Government.

•-C"

The Respondents, of course, attempt to seek a re­
view and a weighing of the evidence by this Court and at great
length in their brief they argue what evidence there was before
the other Courts.

We have not answered that because we have

felt governed by the rules of this Court and we have adhered to
the question only on which this Court granted certiorari.
Now, in a separate portion of the coinion, the
Court of Appeals deals with the question of causation, and
here rules that the District Court was in error.
6

Although

t

agreeing that the proxy statement calls the merger in the
sense that the votes essential ware procured through the un-

V

liwful proxy statement, the Court of Appeals laid down a dif-

4

ferent test of causation asking whether the misleading state­

5

ment of omission caused the submission of sufficient proxies

6

to change the result of the vote.

;
II

7

As the Court of Anneals said, the more exact ques-

I

S

tion is whether that particular misrepresentation or wrongful

;

9

— material wrongful omission — actually resulted in the
votes.

The crux of the Court of Appeals' opinion lies at this

j
11

point toward the end; it is within the last two t>ages of the

12

opinion.

13

the terms of merger suggest that it may be possible for them

14

to satisfy the Court by a preponderance of probabilities; that ;

15

the merger would have received a sufficient vote even if the

16

proxy statement had not bean misleading in the respect found."

"The material offered by Defendants on the merits of

!

i}

17

Petitioner take the position that this kind of
speculation or guess-work or attempt to unscramble fche minds
of fche 5,400 minority shareholders who voted for the merger,

2©

is essentially going to be a guesswork proposition; the tyne

31

of undertaking that Courts do not undertake.

33

decisions, including one by Justice Cardozo long ago, in which

23

at common law he said that we can’t get into these nice specu­

24

lations as to which particular bit of information in a

25

complicated series of facts, affected the person's mind.

7

There are many

But what the Court, of Appeals was really talking

abot here they speak of in a footnote when they say the corres­

3

ponding question in common law is reliance.

nothing in the Borak case and there is nothing in the Exchange

5

Act of 1934, which is before this court;

6

the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Com-

7

mission that says ar-' thing about reliance»

Now,, there is

We get down to the question of what is the purpose

18

of this legislation.

Our test must be Borak because we think

Borak conclusively disposes of this case.

The test is: what

was the purpose? And the purpose was tohave an honest suffrage!
.*
The Rule 14 and Section 14 (a) do not say that, all unfair mer{
gers are barred.

This is a disclosure statute.

It savs that

you must make full disclosure so that there may be a fullyinformed voting on the question that is presented in the proxy
statement.

]i
If the proponents of a merger want, to set out all

the; horrible things, assuiu

7 the plan is just terribly unfair

and they want to set the whole thing out and they tell every­

21

22
23
24
25

thing fully, there is no violation of the statute. But, the
Court of Appeals in interpreting a Federal Statute, has gone
to common lav; standards and -creates this impracticable standard,
as to how you resolve'what’Went on in people8s minds, and this
assumes, of course, that the stockholders would have voted for
any fair merger.

verted into common immediately, would forinq somethina like $6

15

shares of Auto-Lite.
But the reason that the whole plan was unfair was

16

17

that they were -aking this at less than 75 percent of book

value.

19

Now, all of these it is true —Q

I perhaps have missed the point in this case»

20

I thought that there was no attack here on the fairness of the

21

terms of the merger itself.

22
23
24

25

A

I

Am I mistaken about that?

That is not pendincr before the Court, Your

Honor, at this time. The question of fairness we say —
!
Petitioners say -— that the issue of fairness has nothing to do 1
with the remedy and restitution.

9

The trial here — the verdict

1

in 'the Court, below that brought the case here did not involve

2

the question of fairness at all.

3

was a violation of the proxy rules and Plaintiffs maintain,

4

that to establish our causa of action under Borak, fairness

5

has absolutely nothing to do with it.

It was a showing that there

6

Q

Well, that's what I thought.

7

A

The Court of Appeals injected this issue of

8

fairness and they set up a standard that if the raian is fair

9

we will assume that the people wouldhave voted for it and if

10

you, the Petitioners or Plaintiffs, are unable to establish

1?

that the plan was unfair, or putting the burden the other way,

12

they said that the Respondents, by the burden of persuasion,

13

should demonstrata that it is fair, if they can, and they put

14

in their expert witnesses and so on, and then we put in ours

15

and you get down to the question of whether or not, in a very

16

lengthy battle of attrition, as to whether or not it is fair.

We say that it has absolutely nothinn to do with the

18

violation and on that we must stand or fall.

two weeks, to the day, after the stock market crash of 1929 and

We're arguing this case exactly 40 years and

all these investigations, the preambles to the Securities Act,

4

all talk about what they are trying to cure. They are trying

3

to cure the secrecy; they're trying to cure the nondisclosures;

8

they're not trying to say let's have fair plans; you are com­

7

manded to make thisplan fair; you are commanded to make dis­

8

closures and full and honest disclosure, and that's all that's

9

involved.

10
11
12

Q

Do you think it's irrelevant whether or not

these misrepresentations or these omissions affected any votes?

A

1 believe it is irrelevant because Congress in

1.3

passing its statute, did not inject any element of reliance.

14

If we are going to get into questions of reliance and causation;,

15

then we gat into the area of speculation and what affects

16

people's minds and this is something that is almost impossible

17

to unscramble.

18

Defendants had gone back immediately when they were served with

1©

the Complaint and they knew what the facts were, they knew

20

about this other proceeding; they knew about the evidence;

2!

they could have gone back and resubmitted it and would have

22

had a very easy disposition of the case.

How can we go back now, years later.

Fairness is immaterial.

Did Congress intend by the

adoption of this beneficient statute of the SEC adopting the
rule under it, that fairness should be excluded?
Now, may I turn to Borak.

j

Mr. Justice White has

inquired of Mr. Share on that subject matter.

On this issue,

Mr. Justice White, Mr., Chief Justice and gentlemen:

what this

Court said — first, that case as Year Honors will clearly re­
call, of course, was a hodling that Section 14(a) created a
Federal right.

It was not a controversy of citizenship; did not

have to sue on common law or fraud.

You had a Federal cause of

action.

a

case as to the consequences of a violation — great, snail,

3

indifferent, or horrendous as the case night be — what was the

4

consequence?

5

And when there was a pressing in the course of that

Mr, Justice Clark, for the Court, said, "The causal

6

relationship" — and I am quoting from that case — "the causal

7

relationshipof the proxy material and the merger are questions

8

of fact to be resolved at the trial? not here.”

9

Now, may I respectfully suggest that, to me means

10

. .
'
I1
that if a violation is determined upon by the trial court after

11

considering all the circumstances, then the Court goes on to

‘12

determine what consequences of causal relationships have re­

13

sulted.

And not one of those factors is fairness, as the
i

14

Securities and Exchange Commission says in its amicus curiae

IS

brief submitted to "our Honors.
Now, what is the statute or rule that is pi rented

16

'

17

here?

It is simply this:

solicitation subject to this re­

10

gulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement, form of

19

proxy, notice of meeting or other communication, written or

20

oral, containing any statement which, at the time, and in the

21

light of the circumstances under which it is made — may I

22

repeat that, if Your Honors please — at the time and in the

23

light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or

24

misleading with respect to any material fact or which omits to

as

state any material fact necessary in order to make the statement
18

1

therein not false or misleading.

2

New, what happened in this particular case?

A proxy

3

statement of 108 pages, as set forth in Volume I of the trans-

4

cripfc, appendix in this case, was sent to the shareholders

5

three weeks before a proposed mergar meeting of the share­

6

holders, received by Hr. Share's clients.

7

over the proxy statement to him; the other felient, I don’t know

8

whether it was Mr. Mills or Mr. Susman, to Mr. Norman Asher of

9

the Chicago Ear, both distinguished lawyers.

They expressed

10

their views —- that is, the clients*, that they understood

the proxy statement and they were opposed to the merger and

12

they voted against the merger; and they appear here as Plaintiffs

14

16

Now, I have never been quite sble to comprehend Mr.

17

Share's argument, either in the trial court ox- in the Court of

18

Appeals or in this Court, as to what he means by "restitution."

19

May I suggest to Your Honors that I can resort to Mr. Shura's

20

brief in which he says as follows, as to what consequence he

21

wants to flow from what the Court of Appeals held in this case,

22

if Your Honors please, was a misemphasis — not a horrendous

23

condition; a misemphasis with respect to the relationship of

24
'25

directors in these several corporations•
Mr. Shure says at Page 69 of his brief — so I don’t

misinterpret him — this is what he says:

"Here the Petitioner

Mr. Jenner, haven’t both Courts found the

material omission here?

Do we have to reargue that question?

Is that a question of fact or what?
A

We think it's a question of fact, and we

believe because the Trial Court followed so-called summary
judgment procedure, that we have never received a full trial on
the issue of whether this difference in emphasis was, in fact,
a material ©mission.

That question isn’t here is it?

No; we didn't cross-petition, if Your Honor

I must say to all of four Honors in great

sincerity and candor that my clients can live and live well

16

with the opinion and judgment of the Court, of Appeals of the

17

Seeenth Circuit, because the Court of Appeals in the Seventh

m

Circuit remanded this case to the Trial Court to afford us a

m

trial on the issue of whether, as stated in 14(a)

20

15

order to encourage that, there should at the outset, as quickly

16

as possible, be some kind of a technical finding of liability.

Now, the liability with which the Government sneaks, is not a

Mr, Shure, Your Honors will recall from the record,
prosecuted a cross-appeal from the District Court's Opinion
in which the District Court had struck out of his judgment a
finding that this merger was void,
Mr. Shure does not argue very vigorously in his
reply brief,

but he did argue in his opening brief and his

petition for cart in this case, that it was all void.

How,

whether this Court, having before it now, the position of the
SECe Mr, Justice Harlan, to create a Federal law of corporations
in which the Court would hold that 14(a) and the rule under it,
I

14(a)(9), does give a District Court jurisdiction to allow
'
'

j

attorneys fees and suit expense even though the traditional
creation of a fund or other benefit is not obtained, but only
after it has been called to the attention of the Court, some de­
viation from 14(a)(9)and the proxy material should be restated
and there should be a resolicitation.
In order to encourage that, says the 'Securities and
Exchange Commission, fees and expenses should be allowed.
May I suggest to Your Honors in that connection, that!

23
24

as I have trouble going through that theory, I would liken it
to this? as a possibility; In vour experience, and of course, all

25
25

t

litigators,, are will and trust-constructing cases in which the

2

testator has a will, or a trust is prepared, and there is an

3

J
ambiguity in it, if it i- his cause or his lawyer’s cause, thenj

4

the expense of resolving that ambiguity is assessed against the

5

estate and perhaps that may be an avenue whereby the Securities

6

and Exchange Commission’s suggestions to this Court may posi

7

8

sibly be accommodated.
Now, it seems inconceivable to use — of course, I'm

9

an advocate and it seems, inconceivable to me because I'm advo­

10

cating for a client — but trying to be as candid as 1 possibly

1.1

can, X can't conceive of a situation in which fairness — I

12

wouldn't say it was a defense; it's a factor to take into con­

13

sideration in the ultimate resolution o% the whole case.

.

As we complain in our brief, we tried; we tried; we

j

tried before His Honor, Judge Parsons of the District Court, toj
1 i

16

have this case set for trial on all three counts; not on these

17

motions for limited findings on summary judgment and then a

18

reference of the whole case to a master with no limitations on

19

the Master; no guidelines to the Master as to what he was going

20

to decide on the causation and result, and as the Court of

21

Appeals held, that the reference to a Master here had to fall

22

with the order, but not only because it fell with the summary

23

judgment order, but also because there were no guidelines — an"

ment?
As far as the Govern- j

i
meat is concerned, I believe on Page 18 of their brief they did j
not explain what they meant by "earnings potential, loss of
earnings or earnings potential,"

Obviously, looking at the

Government's brief and looking at their other writings, it is
inescapable that this is an tan just enrichment we are talking
about and we can get at that unjust enrichment in any way that

the facts can be reached, and we say that there is no room for
any further hearing on causal relationship? all there is is
room for remedy.
If somebody wants to come in and have a trial on the

17
question©? fairness of what we received, this is an entirely
18
different situation fromproving fairness. Now,the Government say s
19
says to us:

"You are not entitled to get any damages if you

20
didn't lose anything."

But what did the Court of Appeals say?

21
The Court of Appeals said, "If you don't get divestiture, be cans;

22
because it was a fair plan, then you dont get anything," except,
23
of course, as they gave us a bill for $9,000 of costa for 1
24
losing the appeal. They reversed and assessed the costs

against us, when we vindicated the law and we won on the issue

£

of materiality and the fact of violation, but they say that we

3

lose the case and we get absolutely nothing by restitution or

4

any other way.
The Court of Appeals seems to envision this as either

divestitute, unscrambling a merger, and if you read their
opinion, the language is very clear.

They give this as a rat­

ionale: not every merger should be set aside because of a non­

disclosure.
Now, 1 am aot going to rebut what Mr. Jermer said

about whether there was fraud charged or not; that matter is not
before this Court and we didn’t do it in our briefs; I don’t
think we should spend our time on it now.
The Respondents will get. a full trial on the question ;

of mhafc the damages should be.

We don't, want this Court to

foreclose us fromusing any of the means of securing restitution
that Borak says should be followed and Borak relied on Deckert
!
versus Independent Shares, which also talked of restitution; and
Borak talked of the Section 33 Act which gives a restitutionary
remedy.
Now, this is what we're talking about, that the wrong
doer gets no benefit whatsoever out of his wrongdoing.
