ORAL ARGUMENT BY LESLIE HAROLD LEVINSON, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

1

MR. LEVINSON:

Thank you.

may it please the Court:

i

j

Mr. Chief Justice, and

This case is on writ of certiorari
i

9

from the Florida District 'Court of Appeals which affirmed a

10

grand larceny conviction of Pefitoner, Joseph Waller, Jr.,

11

whom 1 represent.

12

This Court thought that the case to be argued

13

immediately after the case of Ashe versus Swenson, which we

14

have just heard.

IS

Two issues of great importance in the
i_
I
administration of criminal justice in the states are presented;

16

by this case.

17

provide grounds for reversing the judgments below.

18

Each issue, in our view, independently would

On® issue is a double jeopardy issue.

I

That, is to

20

say, whether the double jeopardy rule as applies to the states
Ij
•
through the Due Process Claus of the 14th Amendment, is

21

violated with a separate municipal and state■prosecution of

22

the same defendant arising out of the same conduct.

19

23

The second issue in this case is whether the Due

24

Process Claused' the 14th Amendment is violated where the

25

Trial Judge imposes sentence of imprisonment after reading a
9

1

presentence investigation report which he refused to make

2

available even to the defendant or to the Appellate Court,

3

The facts of the case are not in material dispute

4

and naver have been.

Up on the City Hall of St» Petersburg

5

Florida there was a mural, a piece of canvas attached to the

6

wall by glue or other adhesive.

j
!

?
One day in 1966 in broad daylight and during business \

7

%

8

9

hours and in the presence of a substantial crowd, which .
included police officers and other public officials, a group

10

of people went to the City Hall and tore this mural off the

11

hall and brought it downstairs into the street and started

12

walking through the streets of the city carrying the mural.

15
16

17
18
19
20

the mural portrayed the Negro race in an insulting caricature, j
And -the people were expressing their disturbance by this form
of demonstration,
It is undisputed that the Petitioner, Joseph Waller,
was
Jr.,/a member of the group and that he personally participated
in the removal of the mural from the wall and in carrying it
through the streets of town,
l
A very short while after and as part of the same

j
j

The people engaged in this demonstration alleged that

13
14

I

continuous happening or conduct, the police confronted Waller

j

and the other individuals and recovered the mural after a
scuffle.

By then the mural was in a slightly damaged conditioni,
>

25

j

Perhaps the only conflict in the testimony in the case was just
3

1

when the damage occurred.
But at any rate, the mural was recovered by the

2
3

police and Waller was immediately apprehended.
First, Waller was prosecuted in the City Court on thej

4
5

charge that he had violated two city ordinances during that

6

course of conduct.

city property.

11

12

The other ordinances disorderly broach of the j

peace.
He pled not guilty to both charges? a trial was held j

9
10

One ordinance concerns construction of

in the Municipal Court.

Waller was found guilty on both,

charges and was sentenced to the maximum of 90 days on each
charge, the sentences to be served consecutively.
While he was serving this total of 180 days onthe

13

city ordinance violations, an information was charged alleging|

23

the felony of grand larceny.

And this grand larceny prosecu­

tion is what turns out to bs the subject matter of the presentj
case.
alleged
It is undisputed that, the events/ -- in the informa­
tions tor grand larceny concern the identical sentence that
is the threat to Petitioner and concern the identical course,
of conduct at the same placa and the same time the same" mural
and the same general course of transactions.

And this fact

has been conceded by Counsel for the State of Florida.

It is

,

24
25

also established by an affidavit executed by the Petitioner
and included in our Appendix, Page 15, the District Court of

4

1

Appeals also found as an undisputed fact that the same

2

defendant in the same course of conduct were involved both

O

in the city and in the information for grand larceny filed by

4
5

the State of Florida.
■
I
Q
I understand that there is no dispute about the

6

fact that it's the same defendant and -chat it was the same

7

general course of conduct.

4*2

I don't quite understand how it
j

8

could be actually the same action that could be disorderly

9

conduct and what was it ~ malicious destruction of property

10

or destruction of government property?

11

A

12

Q

Destruction of city property.
City property.

That was the subject of the

13

first one trial under the city ordinances and then the subject i

14

of the second trial under the state law was for larceny.

Well? Mr* Justice, in both trials —

•

i

Q

Larceny generally doesn’t ~ I mean, a conven-

17

tional larceny case doesn't generally embrace what we ordin-

18

arily think of as disorderly conduct.

19

A

Mr. Justice, in the felony file in the circuit

20

court — that is the file for grand larceny a point was

21

raised by the Defendant that larceny generally consists under

22

Florida law as elsewhere, the stealing of €ie property.

23

However, the District Cotart of Appeals affirmed the

24

Circuit Court on the theory amongst others, that larceny

25

in Florida may also consist of the destruction of the property
;

5

j
I
!

.

1

rather than the stealing of it.

Or even creating a reasonable!

2

risk of destruction under Florida law is sufficient

3

to constitute larceny»
The record contains a charge to the jury of that

4
5

effect and. we do not include it in the appendix# but the

6

Court may wish to refer to it.

7

And the Opinion of the District Court of Appeals

j

j
Q

I was suggesting on the question that it might

\

be possible in a case where — let’s assume there was a Federal
6
j

1

statuta that makes it an offense to steal government property

2

and another statute that makes it an offense to destroy it —-

3

Federal Government property.

4

I suppose it's conceivable that a person -might steal j

5

a portrait of George Washington from the White House and then >

3

a couple weeks — and be guilty of stealing it — and then a

7

couple weeks later in fear that he was going to be discovered,

8

destroyed it.

fj

You wculdnt contend those were necessarily one

9

'

.

SG

offense, were they?

11

A

Well, certainly not, Mr. «Justice•

They would

12

take place under your circuit’s fences at different times, for

13

one thing and they would offend different policies of the

14

state.

■

What I suggest here is that the single incident would,

15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24

25

happen continuously within a very few minutes, was the sole
evidence introduced both in the City Court and in the Circuit
Court.

And the state strained rather far in order to label

it grand larceny.

Presumably, wanting to, if I may use that

expression, "thro-*? the book61 at this Defendant.
Q

What property was destroyed?

|

What was -the claim
j

in the first trial that was destroyed?
A

Mr. Justice, there is no record of the trial in ;

the City Court and I was not there personally, and I have to
rely on the affidavits of the Petitioner, who was there.
7

And

1

2

his affidavits , which have not been controverted, state that
the same facts which were introduced in evidence in the City

3

Court as in the felony court.

4

entered the City Hall? tore the mural cff the wall; carried

5

it out in the street and it was recovered in a. dasaagsd

6

condition.

1

Q

That is the fact that he

Welly I suppose that it’s possible that on that

8

stated fact that it wasn’t the painting that was destroyed,

9

but the wall.

'IO

A

Yes, indeed, it is possible.

n

Q

And that the — what was stolen was the paint­

12

ing.

What was destroyed was the wall.

13

A

This is possible and we concede

that it is
f

14

possible that a single course of conduct may, indeed, offend

15

a

number

o£ statutes at the same time.

16

Q

And even maybe different, separate acts,

17

A

Maybe.

WE believe that our rule of compulsory

18

rejoinder would require that as many complaints that the

19

state may have against the Men&ant by reason of this course

20

of conduct, they can join it into one trial? try him once on th

21

the multiple counts but not to keep on trying him a number of

22

different times, so that to use Mr. Clifford’s term, he

23

should not have to "run the gauntlet” of the criminal process.

24
25

Q

You would say that in the last case, in the

robbery case, robbing several people atthe same time that if

8

1

1

a Defendant goes up to one person and lifts his wallet out of

2

his pocket and goes up to the other person and lifts the

3

wallet out of his pocket, but sticks a knife in him at the

4

same time, that the state may not try the person for murder

5

at a different time than they try him for robbery?

8

I think that if _all the facts are known to the state

7

Q

All the facts there are just -~

3

A

I believe that, the state under the arguments

9
10

which we have submitted on our brief and which are — which

11

the state should i
!
|
join together all the charges in a single fils which may-

12

contain

13

which have been violated.

1 wish to elaborate on in a little while

A

There is a — rve have an alternative theory,

it?

16

18

the theory of the lesser included offense. We believe that
•
■
i
either the compulsory
■.joinder or the lesser included of "reuse j

1©

theory would be sufficient to require reversal of the'double

20

jeopardy aspects of tills case.

17

j
.

21

- If 1 may resume, may it please the Courts

After the

22

summary information was filed, alleging the crime of grand

23

larceny, three more informations were filed by the county

24

prosecutor, alleged the three misdemeanors of:

25

assemblyi

(1) unlawful

(2) malicious destruction of public property and
9

1

(3) resisting arrest without violence
]

How, Counsel was able to persuade- the county prosecu~;

2
3

tor that double jeopardy had indeed been reached by filing

4

these three mi&demeanor charges and so the county prosecutor
■

3

withdrew the three misdemeanors and they never came on for

6

trial,,
Bui the State's*

7

-tomey persisted in bringing the

j

8

grand larceny charge to trial and ultimately the trial resulted

9

in the verdict again the Defendant.
Before the matter came on for trial, appropriate

10

11

motions to quash the files as the appropriate Florida means of I

12

challenging the double ..jeopardy aspects of the case* and a

13

suggestionfor a written prohibition was filed in the Florida

14

Supreme Court, as an additional moans of attempting to get the

15

Florida Courts to decide that double jeopardy had bean

16

violated.
We were unsuccessful and the case came up for trial.

17
18

The same evidence was introduced at this trial, according to

19

thf Petitioner’s affidavits, as had been introduced at city

20

courts? the same mural was identified by the same witnesses as

21

the record shows.

22

guilty and was given a sentence from six months to five years,

23

which is the statut©s*y maximum on the Florida law of double

24

jeopardy.

25

And eventually the Petitioner was found

10

as they arose concerning the presentence report, and then 1

would like to return to a discussion of the double jeopardy

19

All motions were denied and to this very day this very Court
no
has/access to the presentence report which is still secreted

20

in the desk of the trial judge in St. Petersburg, Florida.

18

21

The conviction was appealed to the Florida District

22

Court of Appeals, Second District, which affirmed an opinion

23

which is contained in fee appendix and if I may now return to

24

the double jeopardy issue before the District Court of Appeals

j
f

■

25

— and I quote from Page 53 of the Appendix.

11

1

"Assuming but not. holding that violations of

2

municipal ordinances were included offenses of the crime of

O

grand larceny, nevertheless there is no violation of the

4

double jeopardy rule." "Because/’ said the Florida Court of

5

Appeals, "even if a person has been tried within a municipal

6

court for the identical offense with which he is charged in a

7

state court, this would not be a bar tothe prosecution of

8

such person in the proper state courts,

9

of the state since 1894.”

This has been the law

And the Florida District Court of Appeals cited the

10

12

case of Theisen versusMcDavid, which at it happens, mentioned ;
~
i
...
|
that proposition by way of victim, but sincethen the proposi|

13

tion has been indeed absorbed as aprinciple of Florida Law

14

that is at the same — the identical offense could be prose­

15

cuted both by the municipality and the stata without violationj

16

of the double jeopardy rule of the State of Florida.

51

-

•

:

17

First, by way of argument upon the double jeopardy

18

matter, the case of Benson versus Maryland, decided by this

19

Court on the last day of the last term, clearly holds that the

20

due process clausa of the 14th Amendment makes the double

•i

21

22

jl

jeopardy rule applicable to tine states.
We argue that the purposes of applying the Benson
rule a prior prosecution by a municipality within the state

24

must be treated as equivalent to a prior prosecution by the
'

25

state itself.

The reason being that a xaunicipality is & part of
12

!

of the state, a creature of the state and is not an independent

2

sovereign»

4

a dual sovereignty theory»

5

tional Florida law in the Theisen case have urged that the

6

municipality is a separate sovereign from the state and albeit j

j
1
We recognise that there have been attempts to employ |

,.

•

The attempts following tradi-

.

J

7
8
9
10

1?
12

has a special, interest which it may vindicate.
And many of the cases of Florida and other states,
use as an analogy the relationship between the state and
Federal Governments.

Ten years ago this Court held in the

two cases of Bartiras and Abbate, this Court held that succes­
sive prosecutions by siste and Federal governments are per­

13

missible within the framework of the double jeopardy rules.

14

We do not think it is necessary to reach the Bartkus and

15
16

17
18
19
20
2?

22
23
24
25

Abbate decisions in order to dispose of the present case.

We

think the relationship between city and state is not the same
as the relationship between the stata and Federal governments.
Q

Well, suppose you prevail on that point, what

do pu suggest be dons with this case?
should
A
This case I believe/
be reversed., I think
the second trial of grand larceny in the Circuit Court should
never have been held,

1 know, but what is the Florida double jeopardy

rule? the same transaction or same evidence? what is it?
A

The Florida ■—
13

Q

1

As I read this opinion and they run off on the

2

so-called two sovereignties fule and they don't tell us what

3

the double jeopardy rule would be if they were advised that

4

they can't apply the two sovereignty rule,
A

5

Well, Mr» Justice, the leading case in Florida
i

6

on double jeopardy obviously would be a case involving two

7

prosecutions in the state court because no other possibility

8

crosses the threshold»

9

case of Sanford versus State, cited in the brief on Pages 30

And in this connection the Florida

If I may read a quotation from Sanford on Page 30,,
Florida says:

"If fee first information is such that the accused

might have been convicted under it on proof of the facts by
which the second information is sought to be sustained, then
the jeopardy which, attached on the first must constitute a
protection against trial on the second»"
Q

Well, that would suggest, then, as I understand

it, as far as you know the identical facta that established
the municipal conviction were the facts on which the grand
larceny conviction was made»
A

That is correct.

Q

And you are suggesting that — and on that set

of facts Sanford holds that there could not have been a grand

14

t

larceny prosecution.

2

A

3

Q

Thatrs correct,,

i

4
5
S

Now, are we to say that or should we say the

I

wrong endeavor on the two sovereignties thing, should we send j
1
it back to them to let the state courts apply the Sanford
rule in this case?
A

7

I believe that the case is clear enough that
■

8

this Court can dispose of it completely.

Obviously this
j

9
10

1!

Court would first have to reach the question as to whether fchej
dual sovereignty rule should apply and I think clearly this
1
I
Court should hold that —

12

13

Q

WE11, my questions assume the premise that we

A

Yes,

>

agree.
If this Court agrees that a municipality i

14

15
16
17
18

19

is a part of the same sovereignty as a state, then you reach
the Sanford rule-,

I believe the Sanford rule is clear enough

„Q

Should we apply the Sanford rule?

Let the

Florida courts apply It,
;

20

|

and —

A

j

Since Florida has failed to apply it because

they never reached it* I feel that in the interests of justicej
21

22

i

so as to dispose of the litigation, this Court is perfectly
able and certainly has jurisdiction to apply the Sanford rule

23
24

under its general authority to "dispo&Q of the litigation as the;
interest of justice may require.

25
15

i

This man has been in jail for sixteen months.

2

Q

Yes.

3

A

And for about another 18 months he has been out

4

on bond in the shadow of imprisonment.

S

Q

What was his first sentence, again?

6

A

His first sentence was two consecutive 90-day

7

sentences, so that was six months.

8

Q

3

A

Did he serve those terms?
This is a question which is still, unfortun­

10

ately not blear, because he was serving the six months city

1?

sentence? he was also being held for trial in the state court?

12

and when the state sentenced him to six months to five years,

13

the state court'judge said, “allow him credit for the time

14

he has been confined."

15

whether that credit refers to the fact that the Petitioner

16

served a city sentence, or to the fact that the Petitioner

1?

was held pending trial in the state ease.

18
19
20

Q

And we are not yet clear as to

When he was confined on the city eases, had he

been tried and convicted of the state case?
A

Ho, sir; he was awaiting trial and, we have

21

approached the city judge in an attempt to determine whether

22

the City believes that the man has served the city sentence

23

or not and 1 sincerely hope that the judge would agree that

24

he has served his sentence.

25

possibility —

But there is at least a

IS

Q

1

Well, did he serve the city sentence in one

2

city jail and the state sentence in the state penitentiary,

3

or what?
A

4

He was confined in the county and it'3 not
r

3

unusual for city prisoners to be switched around to either

8

the county jail or even to the stats penitentiary while they

7

are awaiting trial on state offenses,

8

is that as a matter of Florida law, it's somewhat unclear

9

whether he has yet served the city sentence or not,
Q

10

And my understanding

I

Does the record show how much bond you were to
!

11

make?
A

12

was attached.

is structured — now, some of them come into being from time

they exercise the option of drafting their own ordinances or

Q

Well# no.

Abbate

dealt with whether or not

21

a state and'the Federal Government could prosecuta the game

22

conduct with offenses against each.
A

23

I think that's meaningless in this argument

24

today because he's told you that if you got all three of these

25

in one part ha wouldn't be here complaining about it,
28
i

i

And that is what he said.

2

Q

Yes, I know.

3

A

He says under compulsory joinder if you were to

4

move against Mr. Waller on all three of these in one court

5

than there wouldn't be any question of jeopardy and we wouldn’t

6

even be here.
So, you cannot have the bast of both worlds? you’ve
*

7
8
9

got to have it one way or the

other.

To’Mr. Waller, I would

imagine it makes no difference whatsoever that ha sits in jailj

to

under one theory or the other.

n

if it isn't; it isn't.
Q

12

If it's jeopardy it is? and

Makes quite a difference to him as to whether

13

he sits 'there once in jail or twice in jail for the same

14

offense.

15

A

I am sure of that.

But I don’t quarrel about

16

the idea that if it is jeopardy it ought to be put aside.

17

I say if it isn't jeopardy, it isn't made jecp&rdy by the fact

18

that it was done in a difforest

19

court.

Wow, we were told that the fact that this is a part

20

of the same transaction, it is one open situation with nobody

21

hiding or stealthily doing this, that ©r the other.

22

i

Well, it seems to me that if that's the rule, then

23

what we wind up with is; if you hold an audience

call an

24

audience before you commit your crime, then that's a defense

20

to the crime of larceny.

But I don't understand it that way.

29

1

And Counsel tell us about compulsory joinder.

2

compulsory joinder?

3

4

may have asked for it, although the record doesn't even

There is no
Now, he

The point iss how can we complain about they should

7

have been brought in the same court?

8

ask whether they were not and structually, Florida couldn't

9

have moved against him in Qua court for these three offenses.

10

Now, the question of Benton,.

The point is he didn't

We're told about

11

Benton doing this, that and the other thing.

12

to tell you, Mr. Justice Marshall, what you meant in Benton.

13

All I'll tell you is that it gives a complaining citizen

14

another reason to complain about jeopardy; that's all it does.

15

Very much the same as Mapp did on search and seizure and

16

Gideon did as to Counsel.

17
18

Now, Benton didn't change anything. It simply says
■
that hereafter it will be a Federally-assured right under

19

which people can complain when they think they have been placet

20

in jeopardy twice, for the same offense? not for the same

21

course of conduct.

22

I don't pretend

Now, if you want to restructure the word "offense"

23

to make it mean same course of conduct, that's one thing.

24

if you are going to stick to offense that's what has to be

25

done and it is simply not the same offense.

But

22
23
24
25

So, I

submit that collateral estoppel can’t apply.
Mow, I’ll give you a good hypothetical.

15
16

And that they didn't have here,

How about

the man who kills two people in let’s say, a span of four or
five minutes in an automobile.

He pleads insanity whan he’s

charged with the killing of the first one and the jury acquits
him.

Then the state seeks to try him on the second one and he

moves to prohibit them by sayings "Well, look here, you
acquitted me and it must have been obvious that you did so
because you found me insane and therefore, considering this
minute span of time it’s absurd to say, wall 1 could have been
insane at this time? wasn’t with the second one,"but the
question is: suppose the jury had found him guilty?
31

Is it

1

just possible that somebody would suggest that he's precluded

2

from raising the defence of insanity on the second go-round

3

because the verdict of guilty precluded that.
No, it does not,

4

and we don't have mutuality here.

5

Weren't the same issues? weren't the same sovereigns? weren't

6

the same victims.
City the victim in the first; state the victim in

7

the second.

8

Some defendant, admittedly? covered a short span

of time, admittedly.

9

But not the same facts? no mutuality? no collateral

deal.

15

I suspect, probably not a great

But if you recall, under the Federal rules, Federal

District Judges are free to make them available to counsel or

16

not, as it happens to suit them.

i7

Nov?-, I think it's clear that if they decide not to

18

give this information to defense counsel, and so exercise

19

their discretion that it's not reversible, ever.

20

I submit

that in Florida, though soma courts have been heard to do this,

21

it is the rule in Florida that they are secret and are not to

22

be made available to counsel, but only available to the Court

23

for such -information as they may take from it.

m

IF it isn’t a violation of law for the Federal Courts

25

32
1

1

not to make these avalible on a discretionary basis, then how

2

can it be for the state court to give it to counsel in this

j
/

3

instance.

4

as what we do with a confidential informant.

5
6

the man to be bedeviled by people who may want to challenge
him;
what the informants may say about/the neighbors and one thing

7

and another.

It’s the samp PSI report? it's very much the same

8
9

We don't allow

Counsel says to you, ”We want to have the oppor­
tunity to check this to see if heresay comes up; to see if

10

inaccuracies are there." The only way he can do that is to go

11

to the people whose names appear in the PSI and tell them:

12

"Look, why did you say this?” And, "your*re wrong," this, that

13

and the other.

14

and will harrass them and you dry up the wellspring.

15

“You must come in and you must correct it,"
j

But beyond that, this doesn’t go to the man’s guilt

16

or innocence.

In Florida the PSI ha’s no function whatsoever

17

unless and until a guilty verdict is found.

18

there is an adjudication? then the judge orders a preseutence

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levinson, you have

. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY LESLIE HAROLD LSVSNSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LEVINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, just a word about
I
In order to establish

14

this question of larceny by destruction.

15

the crime of larceny the state has to prove, amongst other

16

things, there is intent.

17

Now, as I understand Florida law, felonious intent

18

can include either by an act of taking away to conceal the

19

property, or in Florida, felonious intent can be established

20

either by destruction or by exposing the property to an un­

21

reasonable risk of destruction.

22

Since the taking took place in broad daylight in the

23

presence of public officials and police officers, we contend

24

that there is no evidence before the jury which suggested

25

a finding of felonious intent based on an intent to conceal.
41

1

That was impossible under the circumstances„

2
O

4

5
6

And so, since the jury found him guilty, the only
possible basis of a finding of guilt must have been on the
other branch of felonious intent, that is to say, under the
structure of creating the unreasonable risk of daakruetica of I
Ii
the property

Q

How about tearing it off?

A

Tearing it off can only be the ingredients of

larceny if it's carried off with felonious intent and the

presence of police officers negates the possibility of

It

felonious intent on the evidence presented by the state.

Q

You are making it difficult to prove a bank
