Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

This is a voting rights case.

This case originated

in the trial court of Missouri by petition filed by residents in

n

a junior collage district — a state junior college district on

12

two counts.

The first count, the Plaintiffs Sought to question the
right of the trustees of the junior college to locate a college

center of population ofthe community.

In the second count and the only count which is before I
this Court, the Plaintiffs raised the question of the constitu­
tional permissibility of the Missouri statutory formula for
selection of junior college trustees.

}

The Trial Court dismissed both counts for failure to
state a course of action.

Plaintiffs dismissed their count withj

regard to site of location and took an appeal to the Missouri
Supreme Court on the constitutional question raised as to
the trustee selection,

there be invidious discrimination by residence of voters? and

Under Missouri statutes a junior college district

may be formed by the voters of a group of adjacent school

districts, simply by their majority vote they may form* a state

5

junior college district which then has as its boundaries the

6

outer boundaries of the component school districts.

to play in the functioning of the junior college district.

A

I think it is equally argued that the advan­

tages of the district are as advantageous to all the members

who come in that they should come in on an equal basis.

don’t think that there is any statutory or community history

which indicates that the assertion was made to the suburban

district that they would get a greater vote by coming in* so

not get a greater vote.

legislature that set up this system* in fact.

To use your

A

Well, the statute certainly does provide —

13

Q

That is against that background that this

H
15

junior college was created.
A

Well, I can only say that I know of no factual

IS

history background to support this and I would argue that if

17

there is such a background, it is no more constitutionally

13

permissible than perhaps the historical development of the

19

one legislator per county, which this Court struck down in

20

Reynolds versus Sims.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

How new is this legislation?

This authorizing

legislation for junior college districts.
A

About sis: years.

The Kansas City junior

college district was formed in about 5€4.
Q

Thank you? I am sorry to have taken so much of
8

I

your time.
A

2

Nowj having formed the college district, we are

3

now concerned with the statutory provision by which the

4

trustees are elected; and that is by a unique Missouri for­

$

mula which deals not with population but what is called in

6

Missouri statutes, school enumeration.

7

by statute, is simply the area enumeration in a school dis­

a

trict of those persons from the ages of 6 to 20 and 1 presume

8

that the — well, first of all, the purpose of this enumera­

And school enumeration

And 1

to

tion is for allocation of funds for school districts.

n

assume that the purpose for using enumeration in terms of the

12

erection structure in junior college districts is that it is

13

a figure that is provided for in each school district, whereas

14

population figures might not be broken down by school dis­

15

16
17
18

y

tricts.
But, in any event, the statute does provide that
where that — first of all the general

provision is 'that

election of junior college trustees shall be at large, with

19

the exception, however, that if in that junior collage district

20

there is what we would call a component school district and a

21

school enumeration of more than one-third but less than 50

22

percent of the total school enumeration of the junior college

23
24.

25

district, then the voters of that component school district
shall have one-third and since there are six trustees provided
by law, they will have two of the six trustees.

9

And, in any

j

I

district where a component school district has half the two-

2

thirds of the enumeration of the total district, then the

3

voters of that district shall vote for three of the six trus­

4

tees and in the third bracket in the formula is any component

5

school district has from two-thirds upwards of the entire

6

junior college district, then it shall have two-thirds or

7

4.
I

a

How, in each case, the remainder of the trustees are

9

not elected by the other component school districts, but what

10

I would call an election district formed of all the remaining

1$

school districts within the junior college district»
So, what we have here is that the large district,

12
13

traditionally, and in fact, normally the central city district

14

becomes one election district and the grouping of small

15

satellite or suburban school districts become another elec­

16

tion district, whether they be more or less, in fact, than the

«7

total of the central school district.

Of course, the central

1©

school district would have only a third, so that although the j
• >• V' v
formula, by automatic effect is weighted in favor of the subur­

20

ban districts, you could have a situation where the suburban

2!

districts actually have a greater majority of the total school

22

situation or the school enumeration than the central city

10

23
24
25

district.
I should make it clear that this is not a question
of a limited vote.

All voters throughout the entire district
10

i

vote and the school boards themselves have no law whatsoever

2

to pray once the district is formed, in the operation or

3

functioning of the junior college district.

4

Now, how has it worked in practice?

As we have set

5

out in our brief and in the appendix, since its formation the

6

Kansas City School District has had from 59 and a half to 63

7

and a half percent of the total enumeration of the junior

8

college district of Greater Kansas City, and yet during that

9

period, by the formula, it has always had only half, or three

to

of the six trustees.

u

Q

How would you give them what they deserve?

n

A

Well, we point out to the Court that under the

13

statute that if the Court

14

or component district formula, the trustees, under tha re­

15

maining portion of the statute may be elected at large.

m

Q

n

of them; wouldn't it?

18

A

invalidates simply the subdistrict

That would mean that Kansas City would have all

That ha3 not been historically true.

13

that when the community works as a group, subordinate groups

20

have their voice heard.

21

issue, for example, of minority rights, the poverty program,

22

the rats in the inner city, there are many people within the

23

city itself that are against what I would think of as progres­

24

sive schools.

25

The city is not homogeneous.

On the

So that the central city is not homogeneous and

in producing this elective or voter's result there are many
11

i

1

small diversionary groups which work together and it's a

2

process in an at-large election by which different groups are

3

represented and 1 can only state that very easily in Kansas

City where our City Council is elected from part at-large, the

B

Negro population of Kansas City which is far less-than half,,

6

has one Negro Councilman at-large? not because of the power of

7

the majority, but because as a minority they exercise a voice

which is heard.in the combined elective process«

9

same process would work hare.

to

1 think the

However, we are not — and this Court is not com­

n

mitted to telling the State of" Missouri that it must read the

tz

statute so that these trustees are elected at large»

13

Legislature of Missouri has a right to rewrite this law and to

14

set up election districts and there are certainly arguments

15

for election districts so that if there are area viewpoints,,

16

those viewpoints may be represented.

17

The

Ail we say is

All we say is if such sub-election districts are

18

established, that they be equal in population so that one

19

group in one area does not have a greater rate in proportion

20

with the population than does the group in another area.

21

Q

This is population; not school enumeration?

22

Q

When you say "equal in population,” you mean --

23

A

Well, for the purposes of our discussion and

24

throughout this case we have considered that school enumera­

25

tion, being a segment of the population, is proportionate to
12

1

population.

2

Q

3
4

There is no evidence -Is it like the registered voter's situation we

had in the Kawaian case?

A

I would say so.

The statistics have not been

S

assembled in any encyclopedic way? but basically the 6 to 20

6

population would tend to follow the general population.

7

Q

I think we said in Burns that registered voters

a

might be a permissible base „ provided it was the substantial

9

equivalent of the general population base.

to

A

That is correct.

II

Q

And you are suggesting that would apply here

14
IS
!6

17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

using a school enumeration base?
A

We do, sir.

We say simply that if the Court

proceeds on the premise which we believe to be a fact, that
school enumeration is proportionate, then we are simply estab­
lishing a formula for population.

And then the discriminatory

formula of the bracketing, moving in one direction, makes it
an improper population formula.
On the other hand, if the Appellees argue that
enumeration is not proportionate to population and there is no
evidence in the record to support any such position, but if
they are to argue that this is a different type of tabulation
then it's our position that there is no — first of all, this
is not the special group that votes the 6 to 20-yaar-old is
net a limited elector, such as was considered by this Court in
13

1!

Kramer.

It simply would then be an argument that an area

a
a

which has a different ratio of 6 to 20-year-olds, all the

4

&nd we argue that this would be a violation of the one-man,

5

one-vote doctrine.

voters in that area should have a specially-weighted vote.
\

6

I would like to say, expanding the facts in

1

Missouri beyond the Kansas City School Junior College District,
i

a

that the same thing has happened throughout the state.

9

are 9 state junior college districts.

There

Three of them do not

10

have any district in which the fractional formula applies, so

it

their trustees are elected at large.

12

districts, where the situation does pertain we find that in

13

five of the six the discriminatory formula has operated so that
:
in the statistics in our brief we show that in five out of the

54
IS
18

17
IS
19
20

21
22

In the remaining six

six the discrimination proceeds close to the extreme range of
violation.

So, that what we have is that in five out of the

six the weighting of the vote is from one-and-a-half to one
to two-to-one against the large component school districts.
Now, I’d like to summarize very quickly the func­
tions of a junior college under Missouri law.

It may sue or

be sued? it may levy and collect taxes? it may issue bonds?
it may exercise the corporate powers of other school districts,:
'

23

24
25

providing instruction, set fees; conduct hearings on dis­
ciplinary charges? make rifles a^>d regulations for its organi­
sation and the governing of the district; let contracts and

14

t

employ and discharge teachers? approve bills? appoint employee:.3.

a

and define their duties and compensation; pass on the annexa­

3

tion of additional school districts to the junior college

4

district; acquire property By condemnation; hold title to the

5

property of the district and provide for its maintenance and

6

make rules that govern the schooling of its students.
Now, as fcothe decisional developments of the one-man -

7

8

one-vote doctrine to the point where we believe it applies in

9

this situation.

the doctrine did apply.

The Iowa

The Tennessee District Court in

Strickland versus Burns found it applicable and in Delosier
versus Tyrone School Board, the Federal District Court in
Pennsylvania applied the doctrine.
Other courts have also applied the doctrine to cities;.

5

i

In fact, the Missouri Supreme Court itself applied it to a

z

city council of a city of about 5,000 population, something

3

less, perhaps, than the student population of this junior

4

college.

S

in Ellis'versus City Council of Baltimore, applied this

6

doctrine to a city council.

In Armentrout versus Schooler? ^he Fourth Circuit

We believe that the constitutional principle which

7

8

is enunciated by these cases is that where a governmental

9

agency making substantial governmental decisions is elected by

vote of the general electors, each man's vote must be weighted

n

equally.

Well, Wesberry was based on Article I but it

seems to me that whether we're relying on that provision of the

constitution, or the 14th amendment, that the constitutional

concept of the voter's rights and the quality of voter’s rights

25

are the same.

apparently overrides the original Article I, as well as to the

I would say so, although this Court has seemed

to place the Congressional Districting in Article I and

legislative districting and county districting on the 14th

law could provide for the Governor to appoint these trustees?
A

Well, Mr. Justice, you ashed me a question

which I think is not encompassed within the issues in this
case and again, it’s my opinion and X don’t think this Court
has yet to face that question.

There was some suggestion in

Sailors that — more "than a suggestion that the county board

of education there v;as such a governmental agency that
appointment was acceptable because this Court based its
decision in that case on the fact that the selection of the
trustees of the county board by appointment from the boards
of the school districts within the county, was an appointment
process.
I question whether an operating school district

standpoint, Wllgther it be desirable that they be appointed,
Q

I"ra not talking about desirable; but

constitutional.
A

X don't know.

This Court has not given me

any guidance on that point and I don't think it’s presented
in this case,
Q

Has anybody challenged such a law in any of the

15
states?as providing that the governor can appoint trustees?
16
A

Well, certainly in the Sailor case this Court

17

said by its decision that in a different type of a school
18

district, a county board of education, that the appointive
19

process was acceptable.

Now, I see great differences between

20

a county board of education where there are local area school
21

boards or boards of education and the situation here.

The

22
county boards of education are a rather atrophied and vestigaJ
23

type of a governmental agency and in many cases they are
24
being abolished.

They are not districts which operate school

systems.
I think, really, Mr. Justice, you are presenting

3

the question that is a legislative versus administrative

4

question, which has been presented in several of these cases

5

and it seems to me it may have to be decided on a case-by­

6

case basis where there is a law requiring -or providing for

7

appointment if it were to be challenged it would have to be

8

on the basis of; is there a substantial governmental function

9

here which requires election by the people. -I do not think

to

it is in any way presented in this case because the statute

12

this foe an elective process,

13
14
15

Q

A great many important government functions

are performed by nonelected officials; are they not?
A

Yes, sir.

And I simply say that we're not

16

faced with the decision in this case of deciding whether or

17

not which should be an appointive or elective office.

18

Q

And when these functions are performed by such

19

appointed officials you cannot get the perfect distribution

20

that you are — not necessarily that you are aiming for, but

21

that is involved in diatrict-by-disfcricfc selection.

22
23
24
25

A

Yes, sir.

I see your point.

That is true.

I'd like to take just a moment on the question of
substantial government function.

The Appellees speak of

school districts in the context of special districts.
20

We

1

submit that that language is a little more meaningless and

2

in any event, a school district is much closer to a city

3

council or a county government than to the traditional con-

4

cept of a special district.

5

"special use districts," "special assessment district," or

6

"special benefit districts."

7

I would prefer to call them

They have normally three characteristics:

first

8

of all they specifically affect one area of the community:

9

the water district; the sewer district; the levee district,

10

affects the property owners directly who are protected by

11

that improvement.

12

Secondly, normally the assessment, the tax for

13

thatimprovement is against that special benefitted group.

14

And thirdly, it is common for that specially benefitted and

15

specially-taxed group to have the right to be the special

10

director.

17

Now, not one of these criteria exists in terms of

13

a school district.

19

traditional concepts of the American public school system

20

all the people of the community are benefitted by the exist-

21

ence of public schools.

22

Under

decisions of this Court and our

Second of all, by Missouri Law all the citizens of

23

the community are taxed for the schools, either by real

24

property tax or through the personal property tax or to soma

25

extent, by the State Income Tax.
21

1

And thirdly, we have a general electorate so that

2

none of the criteria of the special districts apply,

3

terms of function, I think it equally significant that we're

4

not talking about the narrow function of a special use

5

district.

6

7

from then on the function of that board, whether it be electee

policies of the local school districts circumscribed by the

9

Are they

Well, to some slight extent; but basically

the school boards are autonomous. They make all the major

20

decisions.

They are prescribed to a limited extent by vote

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM J. BURRELL, ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

22

MR. BURRELL:

23

25

As subject to voter approval.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

20

24

A

the- Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I think it is important here as we go into some

slight more detail to the type of district, and junior college

23

1

which wa are talking about and as to how it is organized,,

2

Some of this has been alluded to.

In the first

3

place, there must be, under this 1961 law of the Missouri

4

Legislature, a petition from the voters — a certain percen­

5

tage of the voters of each component school district.

6

these component school districts generally have been furnish­

7

ing elementary and secondary education to the youth in their

8

particular district and they must sign this petition — a

9

certain percentage of them -— in each component, school dis­

10

trict to form a junior college district comprising a number,

11

usually — it could be one — in practice it has been a

12

number of component school districts.

Now,

Once this petition has been signed by the proper

13
14

number of voters it has to be approved by the state board of

15

education, which is an appointd body appointed by the Gover­

IS

nor.

17
18

Q

You mean by that the state board could veto the

construction of the junior college?

19

A

Mr. Justice Brennan, that is correct.

20

Q

1 see.

21

A

The board could — yes, the standards given to

The board could veto it?

22

the board are three: the need, which is somewhat general?

23

a fourth junior college in the area; whether or not there are

24

a sufficient number of highschool students and whether or not

25

there is a tax base sufficient to support a junior college.
24

1

And once the state board of education has approved

2

this petition then there is an at-large election in the pro­

3

posed — in the entire proposed junior college district, as

4

to whether or not there should be a junior college district

5

organised in that area.

6

voters in an at-large election approves this petition, can a

7

junior college district be organised.

S

Q

9

And only if the majority of all the

There need not be a majority in

each compon­

ent school district?

10

A

That is correct; that is correct.

There must

be a majority at an at-large election in the entire district.

11
12

Then the state board certifies that this petition

13

has been passed and the trustees are to be elected and there

14

is, and that is what is before the Court here, a statutory

13

formula for the election of the trustees of the junior

16

college.

17

that this board does — or this six-member board of trustees

13

is operate one junior college in the junior college district.

And in spite of all that has been said here, all

Q

19

Was all this legislation passed together about

six years ago?

20
21

A

It was all passed, substantially, in 1961.

22

Q

Before that 'did you have any provisions for

junior colleges?

23

A

24

Before that, the individual component school

districts could have their own junior colleges like they have

25

25
i

1

their own high schools»

2

q

Just the one district junior college?

3

A

That is correct®

And at that time and it is,

4

I think of considerable importance, there *\?ere seven such

5

junior colleges in Missouri with a total number of students oi

8

somewhat over 5,000.
Q

7

My question was directed to the inquiry of

3

whether or not it is of any significance that this whole

9

creation of this whole junior college district with a majority

10

referendum vote was against the background of this very legis-

11

lative provision for representation that is now being attacked.

12

In other words, an action in reliance, so to speak.

system.

And as a result of that there are today — 1

think there -was at the time these briefs were filed, ten

4

junior college districts in Missouri with about 29,310

5

students.

6

over 30,000 students and with components covering an area of

7

component school districts of somewhere near 120 as opposed to

8

the seven junior colleges in the seven component districts

9

that were affected in 1961.

19

And today there are 12, I tMftk, with somewhat

Q

It8s'probably not material here, but how does

11

the curriculum compare with the curriculum of the state univer­

12

sity?

13

A

Mow, I will say this, that the — and this

14

would answer in part the question of Mr. Justice White — the

15

curriculum is uniform curriculum for all junior colleges.

16

is controlled by the state board of education, with a view

17

that by statute they must consider the admission requirements

18

of the University of Missouri.

19

designed -- I know that a year ago, for example, in Kansas

20

City we could enter ~~ the charge for students in our district

21

was $4 per credit hour- or if you took an ordinary course of

22

15 hours it was $50 tuition but the students in our district

23

could graduate and the curriculum was adjusted so that they

24

can go from the junior college to the University of Missouri

25

if they desire to follow that type of program.

27

It

And so that this is really

1

2

Q

Mr. Burrell, who determines the location of

the junior colleges?

3

A

That is determined by the board of trustees.

4

Q

And is that subject to the veto of the — of

S

any state board?

S

A

No, it is not.

7

Q

And who determines how much it's going tocost?

8

A

Well, with respect to getting the money to

9

build the building and acquire the land that would have to be

20

normally done by a bond issue which would be voted upon foythe

11

people.
Q

12

But the design of the buildings and the amount

13

going to be spent for their construction and all that, is that

14

all determined by the board of trustees?

IS

A

Subject to getting money by the bond approval.

16

Q

That’s a bond approval of the voters?

17

A

That is correct.

18

That would require actually a

two-thirds vote.

1©

And did I understand Mr. Achtenberg tosay that

20

How are the members picked?

City School Board, and I'm not certain about the exact pro­

7

visions of it.

What about the old ones; were they elected or

Under the old law if I'm not mistaken, we have

two political parties, so that would be half of the board for

12

each political party and then they were all voted on and just

13

by soma understanding there was never any opposition, if my

recollection is correct.

Well, the trustee board here is performing an

IS

essential governmental functions governing its usually the

17

authority of the state; no question about any of that?

18

Well, there is no question that i-'* is an

19

instrumentality of the state. I would suggest that it is a

2.0

special corporate body with the sole function of operating

21

a two-year college.
Q

But is there any difference between the school

23

board that operates a two-year college and the school beard

24

that operates six years?

There's no fundamental difference, except in

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS C. DE FEO, JR.,

15

SPECIAL ATTORNEY TO TEE ATTORNEY GENERAL

16

OF MISSOURI, ON BEHALF OF

17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Burrell.

APPELLEES

13

It’s beginning to emerge
to allow
to us that we probably didn't need/as long a time as has been

19

allotted to this case and we hope you would not use all your

time and if your friend in rebuttal will have the same thing

21

in mind, we will continue so you can get home tonight.
MR. DE FEO;

22
23
24
25

I will endeavor to be as brief as

possible.
I will direct my remarks to two factors; One, the
justification for the component district system of election;
40

1

and secondly, that the junior college district that we are

2

dealing with here is not a general governing body in the sense

3

thatit is discussed in Avery„

4

First of all, the legislative options, as 1 see them,

5

in electing trustees for this junior college district, are

6

three, possibly four as an alternative.
Ones they could be elected at. large? two: they

7

8

could be elected from people arbitrarily drawn in election

3

districts? and three: they could be elected from the component

10

public school districts, as in fact, is the statute here.
Q

II

If they were elected at large, of course there

12

would be always the risk that they would all be elected from

1.3

one end of the area? is it not possible?
A

14

Yes, and in particular this question was brought,

15

out earlier and Counsel for the Appellants said that there was

16

a slight chance of this happening.

17

in the Kansas City Public School District where directors were

!8

formerly elected at large, and it is either four of the six or

19

five of the sir. who come from the same high school attendance

20

area.

In fact, that 1 know that

21

So, this is what would happen, we feel, in an at-

22

large election which justifies the. legislature in not using

23

that at-large method.

24
25

Further, I think the at-large method, although if
you can't mathematically say one man's vote is equal to
41

1

another, dilutes minorities'' effectiveness in the community.

z

This is true of the Negro population; the rural population and

3

maybe the inner city population.

4

as a practical matter, elect a trustee who represented their

3

interests.

8

It could not, in many cases,

Even where there is a residence qualification it is

7

oftimes the case that the persons elected are favorable to the

8

majority grouping where they physically reside in one or

9

another areas.

10

I think there is some distinction between the junior

11

college district and the college school districts in general t: 1-Si

12

must be made at the outset.

13

Public school directors have always been elected

14

under at-large in Missouri, with one exception that was

15

recently made.

16

tors are elected from component school districts.

17

which is even more critical, there is an overlapping of

18

jurisdictions.

19

the junior college district as a federation. That’s not

20

strictly true but I think it reflects the essence of component

21

public school districts joined together and forming a junior

22

college district which is taking over a particular function

23

which was formerly operated by the public school district that

24

is a 13th and 14th year of education.

25

In comparison, junior collage district direc­

11

The system of component districts also promotes

important things as reflected by statistics that Mr. Burrell

Next, I would like to point, as a justification for

21

the component district system that component school districts

22

is an established community of interest; it is not an arbitrary

23

election district, but it is set up only for the purpose of

24

elections.

25

district that educates children from five years to 16 years;

The component school district is a public school

43

i
2

from kindergarten through senior high school.
The peoplein that district are accustomed to join

3

in a concern for education? they are concerned about their

4

high school graduates; they have developed communication

5

channels for the purpose of providing education in the area.

6

Therefore, it is almost a natural society; a natural unit

7

that should be represented in the junior college district.

8

And under the present method they can elect a trustee that

9

reflects this community of interest.

10

Furthermore, the component school district system

n

facilitiates the administration of education.

12

district boundary lines change very rapidly; much more

13

rapidly than municipality boundary lines„

14

can change their boundaries in Missouri by annexation; by

15

consolidation; by boundary change elections; by reorganization

16

These occur almost daily throughout the state.

The"'school

School districts

Under the present component district system the

18

boundaries of the school district and theso component district;■

19

change simultaneously, they are always coincident.

20

more, there is economics and facility of administration in

21

holding elections.

22

junior college trustees are elected at the same time as the

23

other school trustees — the component district trustees;

24

thus, to avoid the necessity of two elections.

25

Further­

Under the present component district systen

Mow, if we had equally divided election districts.

rather than components, it would be necessary, in many areas

.

Furthermore, since both of these agencies, the

component, and the junior college, are supervised by the state

7

board of education in curriculum and other manners, this

facilitates state administration of education and preserving

I think also the component district system is

valuable because it makes the trustees directly responsible

So, basically I find a junior college district much

18

more akin to a private college than it is to a city or county

or other general governing body.
Therefore, I would conclude to say that the one-man,
