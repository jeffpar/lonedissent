the Court:

As this is a rather complex case it might be use­

ful at the outset fcj state a vary brief outline form how I
expect to proceed.
As the Court knows, the case principally involve:;
Section 37 of the Leasing Act of 1927 which provides for the

j

patenting of certain mining claims to Federal land which were j
valid, in 1920 and which, in the words of the statute, were
thereafter maintained in accordance with 'prior law-.
So, after the statement I mean first to examine the
history of the law of statements regarding the maintenance of
2

1

mining claims in the ptiblic domain and I do that in full con­

z

sciousness of the difficulties which the Solicitor General just

3

spoke of about lawyers8 history, but nonetheless;, feeling it

4

is necessary to examine that»

v

5

And then 2 mean to cast a critical eye at this

6

Court’s decision in Ickes versus Virginia Colorado Development

7

Corporation which is the other focus of this casa» not

8

necessarily to procure its overruling» although we think and

9

desire that it should be overruled, but as a means of making

10

clear at least the reasons --

11

12

Q

Do you think you can prevail unless we over­

rule?

13

A

I hope we can; yes.

14

Q

I see»

15

A

As a. means of making clear the reasons, at

16

least while we feel it must be limited to its particular facts

17

and that 1 hope leads, naturally, to the questions of review

18

which are also present in this case.

19

This- case is part of the battle over ownership

20

rights to several hundred thousands of acres of land in

21

Colorado and larger amounts in Utah and Wyoming,

22

land contains a rock called oil shale from which oil can be

23

distilled at a high temperature and no one knows quit© how

24

much oil is there or what ever be recovered, but the amounts

25

are huge and I think there will be agreement that it represents
3

All of this

1

at least a century of this nation's present rate of consump­

2

tion o

3

The oil shale which is already in private hands

4

represents about a decade of that century or perhaps more„

5

present technically the most feasible portion of the oil

0

shale over which the ownership dispute involved in this case

7

is raising, represents a similar period and is also in the

8

technically-accessible portion of the shale»

9

At

The dispute generally is whether —

10

Q

In what?

11

A

In the technically accessible portion of the

12

shale» The depth of which the shale is buried under the over­

13

burden varies from place to place and private claims tend to

14

be in the area wher« it8s most accessible

15
10
17
13

Q

And this issue here involves about 10 percent

of the whole, you said?
A

Approximately.

There is seme dispute.

I

think it’s sufficient to say it involves ten years’ worth of
V

19

21

25

oil consumption.
Q

Out of 100.

A

Out of 100

or more,

Q

That makes

it 10 percent.

A

Yes „

Q

And by "technically available," you mean

here is where it is very clear that it does exist? is that it?

4

I
2

3

7

A

It’s clear that it exists throughout; but it

is more accessible t;o present methods of mining.
Q

But the methods of mining are still rather,

so inefficient that it is not economically
A

Mo one has yet mined it, although the Oil

Shale Corporation certainly has plans in that regard.
The dispute generally is whether persons who make

3

claims to oil shale lands before the lands were withdrawn from

9

the possibility of the claim in 1920 had any obligation to

10

develop their claims after that time or could simply hold them

11

in speculation for indefinite periods of time without an

12

obligation of maintenance.

13
14

If the Federal Government has clear title to the
land then it would be able to sell leases to persons who, on

15

condition, really, that they develop it and it would be able

16

to collect substantial royalties once they do.

17

25

If it must

sell or patent the lands to the present claimants, of whom
Respondents here are only representative, they must, recognize
rights and lands which have been left completely undeveloped,
'for 33 years and for which there would be no guarantee of
development in the future, and it would receive only $2.50 an
acre as the total price and there are also obvious differences
in the government’s ability to control pollution, water use
and other environmental factors and to guide a rational develop
ment of the resource.
5

This particular situation here, as a result of the

1

2

Secretary's refusal in 1964 to issue certain patents to oil

3

shale land, including lands held by three of the Respondents

4

here, or groups of respondents, I should say: those represented

5

by Respondents Napier, Umpleby and Brown»

6

patents on the ground that the claims had been cancelled in

7

1931 and early 1932.

3

permitted to become final at that time»

He refused those

An administrative proceeding would be

It is clear that he probably would have also refused

9
10

to patent the claims now owned by the oil Shale Corporation-,

11

which represents the fourth group of respondents, if those

12

claims had been before him, since those claims, too, have been

13

cancelled in default, proceedings in the early thirties. And

14

these cancellations were part of a concerned effort on the

15
16

17
13

Secretary's part to identify and cancel claims that were not
being maintained in the early thirties when evidence was
considerably freshes.1 than it is now.
out in some length in our brief.
The first three sets of claimants, Napier, Umpleby

19
20
21

22
23

and Brown sought review of the Secretary's 19S4 decision in the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado and
there they were joined by the Oil Shale Corporation seeking
da c1aratory j udgment.
", •

24
25

And we set that history

<■

Although Respondents urge a number of reasons below
for requiring the Secretary to ignore these old and final
6

administrative decisions from the thirties,, the District
Court, and subsequently the Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit, considered only one ground, which was that the
administrative had been beyond the Secretary's subject-matter
jurisdiction and therefore, could be given no effect»
Q

May I ask you a preliminary question?

A

Surely»

Q

What are the major oil companies that are

interested, directly or indirectly in this case?
A

I think most of them are, Your Honor, and to

varying degrees.

Interested, I think, is a question of degree,

I should say the Oil Shale Company and the Union Oil Company
are the only two which X am aware that have made a very sub­
stantial independent step towards actual development»
In terms of land holdings, the hearings before the
Subcommittee on Anti-Trust and Monopoly of the Committee on the
Judiciary, which was cited, at least in Respondent's brief,
and X think in ours as well, contained a number of statements
in that regard, and I think I have some here»
In any event, varying of the top 27 oil companies in
the nation -— here we are, at page 192 of those hearings it
shows holdings of patented lands, Union Oil Company has 50,000
acres»

It's page 192 of the anti-trust hearings»
Q

Xt!s not before us?

A

No, Your Honor.
7

1

3

Q

All right* then would you go slow in reading

A

Surely»

it?
It shows the Union Oil Company is

4

holding 50*000 acres;? Mobile Oil Company, 34,000 acres?

3

Tidewater Oil, 22,000 acres and so forth, and I think Pascho

6

in those hearings, the Oil Shale Company, in those hearings

7

has stated that it owns at present sufficient land to produce

8

200,000 barrels of oil daily for 25 years or more and most of

9

the oil companies are in a similar kind of position»

HO

I think the information could be obtained by that

11

place on Page 192 of those hearings.

12

listing, I believe.

It gives' a complete

13

Q

Where does the Union Oil Company stand

14

A

I couldn't say whether they have the rights in

15

any of the disputed lands or not, but I would think, since they

16

are a major holder I would think it unlikely that they did not

17

have a dispute.

Were they parties to the old administrative

proceeding?
A

They were parties to the old administrative

proceeding? that's right.
Q

My view is that I ought to refuse myself from

this case..
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, under the cir­

cumstances we will suspend the argument in the case and set it

And we regret the inconvenient :e

These things do not always appear on the surface

and this is one of the difficult problems and the possibility

of an interested party does not automatically appear in the

case of every record.
So, we will have to suspend argument until a date
