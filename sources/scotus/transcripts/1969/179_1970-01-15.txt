MR. CONNOLLY:

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case calls into question the constitutionality

of an Act of Congress.

*

The statute involved is part of Section 301 of the

11

12

Immigration and Nationality Act..

The statute is set forth at

Section 301(a)(7) includes among

those who are declared to be citizens of the United States at
birth, parsons who are born abroad of one alien parent and of
one citizen parent who has resided for a specified time in the
United States.
Section 301(b) provides that such persons, that is
, ^reign-born persons who derive their American citizenship from
one American parent, must come to the United States prior to
/ their 2 3rd birthday and remain here continuously for five years j
'prior to reaching age 28 in order to retain their American

I

citizenship.>

i

Another section of the code provides that absences
from the United States of less than 12 months in the aggregate.

will not break the required continuity of physical presence in
the United States»

born in Italy in December, 1939.
citizen of Italy.

10
11
12

His father is a native and

Aldo Bellei became an Italian citizen at

birth? he is an Italian citizen, today.
He also acquired American citizenship at birth tinder

8
9

The Appellee, Also Mario Belle!, was

the predecessor of Section 301(a)(7) because his mother had
been bom and raised in the United States and was an American
citizen.
Appellee resided in Italy from the time of his birth
until recently, when he moved from Italy to England.

Prior to

13

14
15
16

his 23rd birthday he made four brief visits to the United States,
the longest being four months in duration.
Gn several occasions when he applied for renewals of
his United States passport he was advised by American consular

$7
officials that he must satisfy the requirement of the period of
1

continuous presence in the United States.

When the Appellee did

19
not heed these warnings and remained in Italy past his 24th
.20

birthday, his passport was cancelled on the ground that he was
21
22

no longer an American citizen.
Thereafter the Appellee instituted this suit for

23
declaratory and injunctive relief premised on the contention
24
that Section 301(b) is unconstitutional.
25
3

A three-judge District

1

Court sustained Appellee’s claim to American citizenship, hold-

2

ing Section 301(b) unconstitutional on the authority of this

3

Court's decisions in Schneider versus Rusk and Afroyim versus
'

4

Rusk.

j
i
The Government has appealed directly to this Court»
We argue in this case: that the type of citizenship

5

6

involved here is of an entirely different type of that involved

7

in Schneider and Afroyim; that it owes its existence entirely

8

to legislative judgment and that the provision for its termina­

9

tion is a reasonable exercise of the same authority by which

10

Appellee's citizenship was created»
We contend further that a decision sustaining this

11

12

statute would not undermine the principles on which this Court8 d

13

previous decisions rested,

14

following points;

17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

{

First, there is no claim that Section 301(b) is a

15

16

We built our argument on the

penal law, either in its intent or its effect.

Residence

abroad is not a criminal or reprehensible act declared by the
American Government or by the American people.

The loss of

citizenship is in no way intended to punish such absence from
the United States,

Therefore, the principles which underlie

this Court's decision in Mendoza-Martinez, is not applicable

i
|

here,
Second, the loss of nationality under Section —
Q

Tell me, Mr, Connolly, if the constitutional

standard were to be that one can't lose citizenship without

1

voluntarily giving it up, I take it this argument wouldn't

2

hold, would it?

3
4

A

Our case would be much more difficult.

I

would not —

j

5

Q

Well, could you win it if tha- were the case?

8

A

I think we could make a contention that

7
8

9.

absence abroad of extremely long-duration may indicate a volun­
tary relinquishraent of American citizenship but then we would
.
be struck with the counter-argument premised on Schneider that

10

we would be distinguished between this class of American —

11

immediately distinguishing between this class of American

12

citizens and other Citizens who acquired their citizenship —

]

13

Q

14

probably —

15

A

16

So that if voluntary relinquishment you

1 think that that’s right, Mr. Justice.

We are contending quite forcefully in this case —
:

17

Q

18

A

Of course.
that voluntary relinquishment is not

IS

necessarily the standard, because of the lack of Fourteenth

20

Amendment foundation.

21

22
.23
24
25

I

My second point is that the loss of nationality under ]
Section 301, unlike the statute involved in Trop versus Dulles, s
does not create the risk of statelessness, which concerned
Chief Justice Warren in that case.

The legislative history set :

out in our brief shows that Congress was concerned that, the
5

i
1

problem of dual nationality and the protectiori of persons

2

abroad who held American citizenship, while holding primary and;

o

permanent allegiance to another country.

4

To such persons the

]
j
loss of American citizenship does not result in statelessness. ]

8

They simply retain the citizenship of the country to which they:
!
have shown their principal attachment.
In this case, the

1

Appellee is, and always has been a citizen of Italy.

s

My third point and this is a critical point of

8

9

distinction between this case end the Court9 s recent precedent

10

is that the type of citizenship involved here does not derive

11

any constitutional protection from the Fourteenth Amendment.
The majority of the Court in Afroyim versus Rusk,

found in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, a protection
against involuntary expatriation for those persons whose citizes
ship is declared by that sentence.

The process by which the

first sentence in the 14th Amendment was held to include cer­
tain substantive guarantees and the type and scope of these
guarantees are matters which I eo; feps are not entirely clear
to me „
But it does seem clear that whatever those rights
■nay be they are guaranteed only to those persons whose citizen­
ship is declared by the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.
The first sentence of the 14th Amendment reads:

“All persons

bom or naturalized in the United States and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of

S

1

•ehe state wherein they reside.

The Appellee, of course, war

not born in the United States.

There may be some question of

3

whether he acquired his citizenship by naturalisation, although

4

he .does not press that contention,

5

301(a)(7) can be considered a naturalization statute as that

term is used in the 14th Amendment.

to

12

We doubt whether Section

We can find no authority

But, even if —
Q

Wall, what then is the constitutional author­

ity of Congress to make him an American citizen?
A

Mr. Justice, that is not entirely clear.

The

13

Court below passed over the point in its opinion end in our

14

brief we agreed that there was constitutional authority to

15

grant tills type of citizenship and suggested thafcit might be

16

premised on the naturalisation clause and it might'be premised

17

on the Congress's inherent powers, the legislative body of the

18

sovereign to declare the classes of persons who will be con­

19

sidered its citizens.

20

My own research in the area leads me to conclude that

21

the creation of this class of citizenshipis in the exercise

22

of an inherent power, rather than the exercise --

23
24
25

Q

Of course that power, could the Congress make

every resident of G&h&da or every Canadian an American citizen,
merely by legislation?

7

1

Q

They made Mr. Churchill one, didn't they?

2

A

They perhaps could.

The basis for my con­

3

clusion is that the Congress — according to the English pre­

4

cedent where the use solely was the fundamental law of citizen­

5

ship, but as I- will show later, was amended by Parliament in

6

1350 to provide for a limited grant of citizenship to children

7

born of British Nationals overseas.

8

viewed that as of the same order of creation of citizenship as

9

in natural law of use solely? and thatit was considered to be

10

part of the naturalisation process which proceeded separately

11

by separate statutes.

And 2 believe that that was the approach which the
founding fathers had in the constitution? that is to the extent
that this power is existing in Congress? it exists as a natural
incident in the sovereignty, and there is limited authority to
site for that.
Q

The very first statute —
Does that suggest that instead of the first

sentence of the 14th Amendment, Congress might have enacted a
statute which overruled Dred Scot?
A

2 think so.

The civil rights —

Q

Going back to your earlier quotation of the

first sentence of the 14th Amendment, do I understand your
position to be that one who derives his citizenship, achieves
his citizenship by being born in Italy as here, of two American
parents, then residing in Italy, has less in the way of protectior*

8

t

than an Italian National who carae over here and became a

2

citizen by naturalization?
sI
A

3

Well, his citizenship would not be derived.

4

He would gain no protection from the first sentence of the 14th

5

Amendment.
Q

Well, then it follows from that that he does

It does follow from that that —

Does that seems rather anomalous!?

But, insofar as citizenship is to be created by the

9

Mr. Justice Brennan, just to complete my answer to

10

ii

your question, soma limited authority to my proposition conies

!2

from the very first law containing this provision providing for
the grant of citizenship to children born abroad.

3

In that law

4

which was passed by the First Congress in 1790, it says that;

5

"tod the children of citizens of the United States that may be

:6

born beyond sea or out of the limits of the United States,
shall be considered as natural-born citizens.

7

I suggest that

it wasn't in the exercise of its naturalization authority under

;3

the constitution.

to

Were there any judicial challenges to that

kind of legislation before the adoption of the 14th Amendment?

3
14

A

19m not aware of any.

We take the position that even if it is assumed that
the Appellee acquired his citizenship by naturalization it
still would not come within the: 14th Amendment»
10

This is so

'I

because he was neither naturalised in the United States, nor

2

was he subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when he

3

acquired his citizenship.

4

j

The history of the amendment confirms what its

S

language unmistakably contemplates, that it was directed to

6

events occurring in the United States.

On Congressional enactments.

This was established more than 100 years ago by Mr.

Horace Benny in the study which has fchrica been cited by this

4

OH the basis of the foregoing points, the primary

5

question presented, in our view, is whether the Congress, in

6

the exercise of its power to grant citizenship to the foreign-

7

born children of American citizens may condition that grant on

8

the child’s coming 'to live in the United States for a certain

t

10

Q

Well, Mr. Connolly, on that point if you were

11

right and the constitution leaves these situations to Congress­

12

ional regulation, then what is there left of the argument of

13

voluntary relinquishment in this situation?

14
15

A

our view, is inapplicable here.

The voluntary relinquishment, Mr. Justice, in

Q

That is not a test.

If that standard is a standard at all it would

•apply only to constitutionally-conferred?

'10

A

19

That is correct.

The legislative history of the requirement of five

20

years continuous presence in the United States, shews that

21

Congress was concerned with the unsatisfactory status of persons

22

abroad having both American eitizenshipand citizenship in

23

This was, and it is today, a legitimate con­

The presence of American citizens abroad imposes on our

4

The carrying out of this duty inevitably results

An examination of any of the several textbooks on

nationality will reveal that there are many types of conflicts

which may develop on matters such as reparations* protests and

not settled on the resolution of many of these conflicts.

9

conflicts are, to borrow the language of Mr. Justice Brennan,

*0
11

It also would reveal the fact that lax»/ is
These

"serious problems, inevitably implicating nationality.,"
To continue with Mr. Justice Brennan’s concurring

12

opinion in Mendoza-MartinQZ, we have recognized the entangle­

13

ments which may stem from dual allegiance, and have twice sus­

14

tained statutes which provided for the loss of American citizen­

IS

ship upon the deliberate assumption of a foreign attachment.

IS

The Congress recognized that an unconditional granting

17

of American citizenship solely fo€;cause one of the individual’s

18

parents was an American citizen, meant that our government would

19

risk involvement in such international disputes on behalf of

20

persons who had no attachment or allegiance to the United States

21

This much the Court below also recognized.

It said:

22

"There is an undeniable danger that children born and raised

23

abroad in a foreign home where English may never be spoken?

24

schooled where English is not taught, celebrating foreign

25

holidays with the family of the non-American parent, will have
15

1

no meaningful with the United States in culture or heritage»

2

It is; of legitimate concern of Congress that those
|

3

who bear American citizenship and receive these benefits have

4

some nexus to the United States» Thus, the Congress decided

5

that in continuing the grant of American citizenship to for­

6

eign-born persons to which the 14th Amendment does not apply,

1

it was desirable to reduce the risk that there would be a class

3

of citizens living permanently abroad, having no attachment to

9

the United States»

It sought to achieve this goal as it had

10

done under the naturalisation laws by requiring a period of

11

residence in this country.

12

prompted it we thinkthat this requirement is entirely reason-

13

-able.

14
15

In writing the considerations which

Q

What is the period of residence for an alien;

is it five years?

16

A

I believe it is five years? for naturalization?

17

Q

In other words: you are saying that it isn't

18

too much to ask of an American citizen who's claiming deriva­

19

tive citizenship because he was born of American parents in

20

Europe or somewhere else, ask him to do the same things that an

21

alien must do.
A

22

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice; something along that

23

line.

It says that

The same considerations which prompted

24

Congress to require a period of residence in the United States

25

for aliens, to make sure that they had some association with
16

1

life in the United States, are the same considerations which

2

prompted the Congress to enact this particular requirement and

3

in this case, coupled with the fact that the presence of such

4

people abroad imposes burdens on the United States in its

5

diplomatic representation»
,The final question, then, is whether Congress may

6
7

constitutionally make a residence requirement a condition of

0

the continuation of this statutory citizenship rather than the

9

acquisition of the citizenship.
The Congress, of course,, could have provided that

10
11

children born abroad of one American parent shall become

12

citizens after a period of residence in this country.

13

this would have had unfortunate consequences during the child's

14

minority when the American parent could not rely on American

15

diplomatic protection to his or her child.

But

It also would have

9

created novel problems of status and rights when the child

So, the Congress elected to declare the minor child a

for a period of time.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY 0. JOHN ROGGE, ESQ

For

Very well, Mr. Connolly.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

19
20

MR. ROGGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

21

Court:

In addition to the usual documents in this case, the

22

Court should also have before it the brief amici curiae in one

*20
£,<J>

of which the American Bax." Association has joined.

24

May I spend just a brief moment on the facts;

25

Mario Belief's mother was born and raised in Philadelphia, where

18

Aldo

1

she stayed until she was 24, when she married Aldo Mario

2

Beliei's father* and moved with him to Italy.

3

remained in Philadelphia.

4

Mario Beliei came to this country to visit his grandparents.

5

On the first two such occasions, he came on his mother8s pass­

6

port and on the second two such occasions he came on his own

7

passport.

On five different occasions Aldo

The fifth occasion our State Department denied him a

0
9

Her parents have

passport.

I
II

This was when he wanted to come here with his bride

10

to visit his grandparents and he did, but he did that on an

11

Italian passport.

12

Aldo Mario Beliei has had his own United States

13

passport as an American citizen for a period of 12 years.

14

first got it, as you will see from page 6 of the appendix, on

15

June 27, 1952,

16

it was renewed from time to time until February 11, 1964,

He

If you will turn to page 11 you will find that

17

Now the Government comes along with a condition sub­

18

sequently imposed and seeks to take this away and I think this

19

case presents the simple question of whether the Congress has

20

the power with reference to an American citizen at birth to take

21

away that citizenship without his voluntary renunciation and

22

could do that consistent with the due process clause of the

23

Fifth Amendment.

24
OR

That's what I think the issue is in this case.

And in answer to the question that you put, Mr, Chief
Justice Burger, I think it is the government's position that

5

two aliens coining over here, having a child born here and re­

2

turning to their own country, or in the case of persons

3

naturalised over here with a minor child, that those children

4

have greater rights than a person like AIdo Mario Bellei, who,

S

by Section 1993 of Revised Statute as amended by the Nationality

3

Act of 1934 was given American citizenship at birth„
I think, as a matter of fact, that Schneider against

7
8

Rusk is precisely in point because Angelica Schneider never

9

went through naturalisation proceedings.

Her parents came over

to

and ware naturalized and an act of Congress then said that she

11

was an American citizen.

12

against Rusk is is directly in point? and in that case it was

13

held that the fact that Angelica Schneider, who had citizenship

'34

by statute, she could go abroad to Germany and stay there and

X cannot see but what Schneider

15

the three-year residence requirement was declared unconstitu­

16

tional .

..

. . ..... .....

.

X submit, the same reasoning that in Schneider against

?!?

Rusk compelled that provision to be held unconstitutional com­

18

19

pels the section that was attacked and held unconstitutional

20

below, which is a provision of the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1952, is likewise unconstitutional.

21

22

The-provision at the time that Aide Mario Bellei was

.

23
24
23

born required that he come here for five years immediately
previous to his 15th birthday and unless within six months
after the child's "21st birthday he or she shall take an oath of
20

1

allegiance to the United States of America.

2

How# that section was repealed by the Nationality

3

Act of 1940# but that repeal had in it this proviso that the

4

repeal shall not terminate nationality heretofore lawfully

5

acquired*

6

So# you have someone who has American citizenship at

7

birth and Congress comes along in a condition subsequent#

8

subsequently enacted and says he doesn't have it any more.

9

the government says# "Well# this thing about coming here for

period of his life in order to acquire it.

16

who can’t.

a person has no meaningful connection with the United States.

19

Well# I submit that this country has changed in the past 40

20

years where Americans living abroad have increased 20-fold from

21

some 100#000 a year to 2 million a year.

22

Q

Are those permanent residents# you meari?

23

A

They are residing abroad.

I mean they are not

24

just travelers.

As a matter of fact# Mr. Dulles wrote a piece

25

in which he was talking about the million in Europe to which
21

1

there are added a million tourists.

I !rn not talking about

2

tourists.

3

Chief Justice,™” I mean residing there.

I9m not saying — when you say permanently, Mr.

Nontourists? yes.

6

In mostof the big cities of the world you have large

chunks of America, today.
Q

How many of those are military? does this

record show?
A

1 think about half are military? half of the

two million.

11

12

As a matter of fact, rather than worrying about having

13

a meaningful connection with the United States, Europeans are

14

worrying that we are Americanizing Europe.

15

A study was done of 25 families with American v/ives.

10

All but two fathers spoke English? there were 47 children there?

17

26 spoke English as a primary language or English and French

18

with equal fluency; only five spoke French.

19
20

I submit that ws should regard these international
children as a valuable asset of this country.
Q

21

.

23
24
25

Does this statute apply to the children of our

military who are stationed abroad?
A

This is another thing;

If a child is bom of

Court should hold that this statute is const!fcti&onal, then
22

another Congress can come along and say: Children bora of two

Q

Well, why I was interested, Mr. Rogge, was that

I°d almost say to Mr. Charles Gordon,

7

"Does he know of an exception for that situation?*

I don't.

8

But, in connection with Your Honor's question, I do

S

want to emphasize that if this statute is held constitutional

10

then Congress has the power at some future session to come alone

11

and take away the American citizenship of a child bom 'abroad of

12

two American parents, on the government's interpretation here.
It is my point that in today's world of United

13
14

Nations,, and I haven't emphasized this, but I think it is im­

15

portant, that we should regard the children as an asset.

16

17

Q

Don’t you think those are strong arguments,

policy arguments, but do you think they bear on the constitution
al issue, which is our only job.
A

On a due process question, I’d say yes, Mr.

Justice Harlan, but I also say this;
24

I'm trying to meet the

1

argument of the government where they think that these chiId-

2

ren are not an asset:; that they are a burden; we should get

3

.rid of them; they talk about no meaningful connection to the

4

United States and X^d like to counter that by saying that this

5

is an asset that this country should welcome, rather than say

6

that they are a burden.
Q

7

Well, X didn't understand the government to be

8

arguing that.

They were arguing as to whether this was a

9

rational thing for Congress to do.

We might disagree lots of

10

times with what Congress does, but it's none of our business as

n

long as they .are acting within their powers.
A

12

Well, I’d say on that I don't think it is

13

rational thing for Congress to do with reference to someone who

14

has American citizenship at birth, to come along with a condi­

15

tion subsequent, subsequently imposed.

16

Aldo Mario Bellei got American citizenship in 1939 and ha had it

In other words, the

17

— at least he had it until 1952 when the Immigration and

18

Nationality Act came along and said, "Well, now you've got to

19

20

and 28,.

And those early years are the years, if he“s in his

that period.

years when he goes to college.
