ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. KENAN:

Thank you, sir, and may it please the

Gentlemen, this case is here on motion for leave to

Western District of Oklahoma, against the Tenth Judicial

Council of the United States.

1811 briefly state the facts inthis matter.

15

On December 13, 1965 the Judicial Council of the

16
17

Tenth Circuit, entered an order, held after a secret meeting
atwhich Judge Chandler was not able to be present, and the

18

order effectively stripped Judge Chandler of his powers.

S3

was ordered not to hear any of the cases assigned to him, nor

20

was he to be allowed to'.hear any other cases that would be

He

filed in his court; the other judges of the court were ordered
to divide Judge Chandler's cases among themselves, and to en­
ter into a new order of business whereby none of the future
cases filed in the court would be assigned to Judge Chandler.

Council?
MR. KENAN:

I don't believe they are, Your Honor.

3

Section 332 of Title 28 provides that a meeting of the judi-

4

cial council shall be called by the Chief Judge at least

5

twice a year.

&

call a meeting of the Circuit Judges for ether reasons.

7

I'm not convinced that the Chief Judge can't

If another judge calls a meeting„ is it a proner

meeting of the judicial council?

9

only the Chief Judge can call it.

10

According to the statute,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Some judicial councils

11

meet, once a month; sometimes twice a month; sometimes three

12

times a month, depending on the nature and quantity of

13

ministrative problems they have in the court.

14

now as a counsel, not on a particular case.

15

MR. KENAN:

ad­

I'm speaking

Well, sir, the statute provides only

16

that they were to meet at least twice a year.

Certainly meet more often.

19

that other meetings were not meetings of the council if they

go beyond two meetings?

MR. KEN ATT:

No, sir; I believe that this was a

It is the Judicial Council which uttered the order.

Judges»

Of course, they hold their place on the council only

by virtu® of their beinq circuit judges? is that not tfue?
MR» KENAN:

That is true. Your Honor.

I brought

this up only for the purpose of the jurisdictional problems„
which we will come to a little bit later.
This meeting effectively stripped Judge Chandler
of all his judicial powers.

There was not the slightest

semblance of due process at the meeting.

He was allowed to be

present? he didn't know what the charges were? he wasn't
allowed to cross-examine anyone? he couldn’t have counsel.
The order presented spoke in rather strange terms
about why his cases were being taken away from him.

It did

mention the effect on the business of Judge Chanlder’s Court
l

of his attitude and conduct.

It mentioned that he was a party

defendant in both civil and criminal litigation.

Ifc stated

15
16

that one civil case was still pending and there were also two
disqualifications proceedings against him.

17
18

It stated that after a review of the entire
situation that Judge C... ndler was either unable or unwilling

W

to discharge efficiently the powers of his office.

And that

20
was why all of his cases were taken from him.
21
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Again, I sustained the order.

22
Excerpts from it quoted and described in these various briefs.
23

Do we have a copy of the order?

MR.KENAN:

Yes, sir? it is Exhibit A to the original

After that --- after the handing down of the order,

4

we filed a motion for leave to file a written mandamus in this

5

Court,

©

Council’s order,

7
8

We also made application for stay of the Judicial

A few days later, there appeared Solicitor General
Marshall, representing the Judicial Council, and he advised
this Court that the order of the Judicial Council was intended

B
.

10

to be temporary only, pending further proceedings by the

ii

Judicial Council,

12

which hearing the Judicial Council would determine what powers

S3

to use under three sections — this is very interesting. Your ;

14

Honors — it decided not only Section 332, which provides

15

administrative powers, we believe, for judicial councils, but

16

Section 137, which provides a method whereby judicial councils

17

can settle disputes among the District Judges when they can't

13

decide on how to assign new cases in their court? but Solicitor

19

General Marshall mentioned that the judicial council wanted

20

to consider what use of its power should be made under Section

21

372(b) which, as the members of this Court know, is a section

22

that bears upon the mental fitness of a Federal Judge,

23

He stated that a hearing would be held, at

In other words, he was suggesting .to this Court

24

that reason existed, perhaps, for the judicial council to

23

certify fc-o the President that Judge Chandler was permanently
7

?

mentally disabled„

2

Solicitor-General Marshall stated that the order

3

had been issued only to keep Judge Chandler from filling his

4

office while the conduct of his office was thus in question.

5

And it stated that the order was interlocutory , that pending

6

a full hearing into the fitness of Judge Chandler,

j

And then the Solicitor-General said that he had

7

8

Cfirefully examined files in the Tenth Circuit and here in

9

Washington; that it was his conviction that the matter warrantsd

10

careful examination; that it was highly desirable to maintain

11

the status quo and thatpublic confidence in the Federal

12

judiciary would be inevitably impaired if Judge Chandler were

13

to preside over his court while the question of his fitness

14

to serve was under consideration.

j

Well, we can quite understand why this Court denied l

15
16

the application for a stay, based upon this very strong

I

17

language of the Solicitor-General.

j

18

it happened.

If you can understand it,

Anyway, the application for stay was denied.

20

that was denied the Judicial Council then did issue a second

Well, Judge Chandler advised both this Court and

5
8

the Judicial Council that he would not attend such a hearing;

7

that he challenged their jurisdiction toremove cases from him»

3

and upon that, the judicial council then decided that it

9

wouldn't hold a hearing.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

10

What did the second order

purport to do with reference to the first?

11

MR. KENAN: Your Honor, the second order merely

12

called for the hearing.

13

At the time that. Judge Chandler stated that he

14
15

wouldn’t appear at the hearing, then the other district judges

16

in Judge Chandler’s court then advised Judge Chandler that the
original order had ordered them to redivide all the cases in

17

the court.

18

This Court had denied his application for stay.

It appeared that we were in for a long session„ with respect

to this matter.

i

Well, after the District Judges then met to decide

z

upon a new order of business, since is appeared that Judge

3

Chandler was going to r@qui.re some time to settle this

4

matter, Judge Chandler disagreed with the redi, vision of his

S

standing eases, those already assigned to him, among the other

6

judges, and he did agree, however, that in order to keep this

7

matter going and not to get into a complete brawl with the

8

members of the District Court, who were only trying to carry

9

out the orders of the Judicial Council, and were going fa let

10

Judge Chandler contest them»

He ©.greed that he wouldn't hear
*

11

any cases assigned —- any future cases filed in his court,

12

although he did not believe the Judicial Councilhad power to

13

take those away from him»
But he disagreed with respect to reassigning cases

15

already assigned to him»

At that —

16

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN: I gather that that District

Court doesn't operate from a master calendar, then; is that

right?
MR. KENAN:

There is a system bwhereby the cases

are arbitrarily assigned to judges, Your Honor.

And that's criminal law,

1

After this new division of order was entered into

2

the Judicial Council then did a strange things. It said,, "Well,

3

we now have power under Section 137 to allocate cases in this

4

court, because there is a disagreement with respect to the

5

division of cases already on file in Judge Chandler's court.

6

Judge Chandler is disagreeing that these cases can be re-

7

assigned.

going to let the present situation stand, as to existing cases

but we're going to redivide the many filed cases.

Therefore," and this was their decision, "we®re

what happened, and they superceded the old order, they said.

13

Gentlemen, at this point, when the first order was

14

order.

15

facts have a bearing upon whether or not this Court should

16

exercise its discretion, which granting of a writ oi mandamus

17

always is, because these further facts bear upon the attitude

18

of the Judicial Council in the true spirit in which this

19

punitive order was entered into.

12

There are other facts in this case that go on, which

The facts can be boiled down, basically, to one

20
21

thing:

22

went through an elaborate procedure designed to create a paper

23

record that they were acting all along to assist Judge

24

Chandler in cleaning up a crowded docket. The got documents

for a couple of years thereafter, the Judicial Council

The facts ware, from the very beginning. Judge

2

Chandler's caseload was a number of cases less than ha

Z

normally decides in a year»

4

order was issued, there was no mention made of a crowded case­

5

load. t This was an afterthought and it was designed by the

6

Judicial Council to try to attain some kind of firm ground

7

upon which to base their assault on Judge Chandler»

8

Your Honor, we came here and we based jurisdiction j
(
of this case upon the All Writs Act. There is a very exceller :

0

The facts are that when the first!

i

10

inquiry into the jurisdictional problems of this case that the

11

Solicitor-General has in his brief, and also th'e Counsel for

12

the Respondent.

13

These jurisdictional problems boil down basically

14

to a single question.

15

General and Mr. Wright do not disagree that the All Writs Act

16

does provide the authority for this Court to act.

17

agree only on the constitutional grounds of whether or not
\
this case is within the appellate powers of this Court. ~

18
19

For instance, both the Solicitor-

They dis“

"

And all that question boils down to one point:

20

Was the judicial council acting as a lower court or inferior

21

tribunal rather than an administrative agency in this pro­

22

ceeding?

23

Solicitor-General Griswold contends that it was.

24

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

25

MR. KENAN:

That is was what?

That it was acting as a court —

MR. JUSTICE BLACK s

a

MR. KENAN:

As a court?

Yes, sir, when it issued this order

stripping Judge Chandler of his powers.

He contends that no

4

matter what their nature, that they were acting as a court

s

would act.
Now, Your Honor, I agree that Congress intended

6
7

that the Judicial Council be an administrative agency.

I

8

agree entirely, and yet this council is composed of judges who

9

have judicial power, and they acted in a way that judges would

10

act, and 1 contend that they were acting with the judicial

II

powers of their offices.

12

And X also will say this:

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you say the same,

14

Mr. Kenan, with respect to judges sitting on the Judicial

15

Conference of the United States, which is also a statutory

IS

body?

17

MR.KENAN:

Your Honor, I contend that the Judicial

18

Conference could act in a way in which was an exercise of the

ia

judicial powers.

29

For instance, a judicial council is given the power

21

to remove a referee in bankruptcy.

22

25

Now, this is the exercise

Thisis given to the Judicial

So, Congress did give, for instance, to a judicial

council, at least one specific and explicit instance of the

right, to exercise judicial powers.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Conference there, didn't you?
MR. KENAN:

5
8

Your Honor.

NO, I was back ©n the Judicial Councils,

I don't -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

8

judicial power which has been invested, in those terms, in the

9

Judicial Council to which you were referring.
The Council, now.

;
11

MR. KENAN:

The Council, fey statute of Congress, is

12

given the authority, when the District Judges cannot agree

13

upon the removal of the referee in bankruptcy, to remove the

14

referee in bankruptcy of their court by hearing.

15

provided by Congress.

16

the Congress believe that a judicial council can act with the

17

judicial powers that the judges have.

So, it shows in this one statute, that

If the judicial officer is able to

employ discretion in the performance of his duty, which dis~

I would say the judicial power is concerned.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

What about his law clerk;

if he dismisses his law' clerk or secretary?
MR. KENAN:

I wouldn’t think so there; I think

that’s an administrative assistance to the judge.

MR.KENAN:

Yese sir, 1 think it if.

If the court

is appointing an officer to perform certain judicial functions j,

8

I think the referee performs certain judicial functions.

9

think itss a very high honor for a lawyer to be appointed to

'

I
I

10

this.

It certainly is an assistance of the judges of the

n

court in their carrying out their judicial functions.

'

12

And I think that when a Judicial Council acts to

13

remove from a judge all of his‘power to hear and cite cases

14

that now we have the strongest possible instance when.' someone

j

16
16

is exercising judicial power.
Your Honor, the main thing is this Section 332

17

which set up judicial councils, and what it means; and I want

18

to direct this Court's attention to, I think, the most sig­

10

nificant part of the case, and that is: what is the meaning of

20
21

22
23
24
25

Section 332?
And it is our contention that in 1948 when there

j!

changes made that slipped by the Congress insuch a manner that
Congressional intent could not have been involved and that fches

these changes cannot foe the law.

The Committee Report of 1948c stated, and it was

2

only eight pagas long, with a big appendix- to it with the

3

reviser's notes.

4

notes are keyed to the sections ofthe revision and explain in

S

detail every change made in the text,”

6

given to the Congress.

The Committee Report said, "The reviser's

That’s the notice

The reviser's notes on Section 332 said, "Changes

7
8

in phraseology were made," and two other remarks, but they

9

don't bear on this case.

10

Your Honor, if you will compare the 1939 statute,

11

which was the original one, and the 1948 statute, and I have

'12

these two statutes laid out side-by-side on Rage 13 of my
■r),

'13

brief, I think that you can see what violence was done to the

14

1939 statute.

15

Now, the 1939 statute has cohension and builds

16

logically from first, the calling of council meetings, to

17

second, the submission to the meetings of the Administrator

18

of the U. S. Court's reports; next to the taking of action

19

thereon by the council,,and finally, notice to the District

20

Judges of their duty to promptly carry out the directions of

21

the Council as to the administration of business of their

22

.

.23

courts.
Your Honors, the 1948 revised version there has

24

been alot said about the fact thatthe word "order" was sub­

25

stituted for the word "directions," but that's not the

i

2

principal change that was made.
The principal change made is that in the 1948 Act
the Judicial Council was given two sources of authority»
In the 1939 Act it was given a single source of authority»

11

The 1948 Act, in the third paragraph continues, as the '39
Act did| it talks about the quarterly reports of the administra­
tor of the courts, and then says, "That council shall take
such action thereon as may be necessary»"

There is the source

of power for judicial councils»
Then it breaks a paragraph and it commences with
the final paragraph; and it commences with a second source of
power, which the 1939 Act.didn't have»

It says, "Each Judicial

12

19
20

Council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and
expeditious administration of the businessof the courts within
its circuit.

It's got two statements of authority»

The *39

Act had one.
And now the sentence about the judges carrying into
effect the directions or orders — I don't care what you call
it — this section is put at the bottom, after the second
source of power of judicial councils.
Now, there has been a lot said about the powers of

21

22

judicial councils being just about plenary, and I can see why,
because when this 1948 revision was made, there was slipped

23
into this statute in the revising process, two sources of
£4
power for judicial councils,

and that was not the intent of

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

details of how that last sentence happened to get in there,

in the legislative history.

covered that.

MR. KENAN:

I don't know whether you have

Well, sir, it was a vary complicated

7

and extended procedure, the actual revising of the code.

8

Bar was involved, the judges were involved, the justices were

9

involved; law .professors were involved.
MR.

10

chief

JUSTICE BURGER:

The

No, I am sneaking of the

11

specific sentence.

12

My recollection of the ^legislative history is that at the time

13

the matter was before the Committee of the Judiciary of the

14

Senate, some Senators raised the question that this statute,

15

proposed Section 332 had no teeth in it; had no teeth, and

16

eitheraa Senator or staff member, someone then reached into the

17

'39 Act and added this modification, which is the last sentence

18

of the 1948 amendments.
MR. KENAN:

19

20
21
22

23
24
25

Was that — my recollection may be faulty.

Do you
Your Honor, my memory may be faulty,

but with all due respect, I do not believe you are correct.
The change that was made was mad® in the House in the 1948
revision.

This was a House bill.

The particular statement

■

you are referring to about the Act has no teeth in it,
occurred in hearings before the Senate in the 1939 enactment.
In 1948 the Act originated infche HOuse and was placed on the
20

1

consent calendar of the House, whereby It goes through

2

automatically, because the Committee Report says that there

3

aren’t any substantive changes made inthe old law, and

4

Congressmen are given this very slight notice:

5

isn’t intended to change the law"and the appendix even said

6

in the House Report, that the law wasn’t changed —

7

MR' CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

"This Act

Well, whether it's in

8

the 839 setting, or the *48 setting, it was in the setting of

9

members of the Senate who thought the statute had to be

10

11

not correct?

14

I don't recall whether it was Chief Justice Groner, or someone

33

who — I believe it was him, as a matter of fact, said in

16

their opinion there were sufficient teeth, because if the

17

judicial council made a direction, that it would be carried

18

out, quite naturally, and no further words were needed.

19

believe that that is the distillation (?) of the 1939 dis­

20

cussion about-were teeth needed.

2i

have been concerned at the' tine about whether they could

22

put additional teeth in there if it came to a point of

23

taking a judge's cases away from him.

Well, sir, Your Honor,. I think the history of the

•

'39 Act really is a history that shows what was really intended

21

f

to be done in *39 was to set up an administrative procedure

2

for the courts to take away from the Attorney General the

3

necessity of attending to these details»

9

directions to the judges, who shall carry out the directions

10
11
12

i

in the words of the statute — "as to the administration
of the business of their respective courts.
I contend that the 1948 revision, because of the

13

Committee Report, which i's true legislative history in any

14

enactment, because of the reviser’s notes that changes in

15

prhaseology were made? that’s all, I contend the original

IS

intenion of 1939 controls, and that the -two sources of

17

authority for judicial councils to act now, don't really change

18

what the law is, because that wasn’t the intention of Congress,

19

The Congress didn’t intend tochange the law.

20

Your Honor, 1 noticed that the Judicial Conference

21

in 1961 issued a report entitled, "The Powers and Responsi­

22

bilities of the Judicial Councils."

23

document; someone got Chairman Cellar to print it as a House

24

Document and it’s quite an elaborate defense of the Judicial

25

Councils, in fact it even appears to me that it’s an attempt t<:

This was a very elaborate

councils.
This report immediately focuses upon the •— the

9

m

first thing it does is talk about the 391-8 revision , and
particularly the change of word "directions/’ to "orders."
Now, that's strengthening word, but that isn’t a significant
thing.

13

"The

chancres are one of form and emphasis, rather than substance."
No change in substance has occurred.

That was the conclusion

of the Judicial Conference in 1961.
.

Biat it's important that that document makes no

a
12

Nevertheless, the Judicial Conference says,

mention of the fact that the 548 statute carries two sources
of powers for the judicial council, whereby the '39 Actonly
carried one.

14
1 submit there-had been no change in the intentions

15
16

'of Congress.
Your Honor, I think that there is another issue

17

18

involved in this case and that is thfet taking all the cases
from a judge? all the cases, is tantamount to impeachment, and

19
I think this is a very serious question here.

The constitution

20
gave impeachment powers to the House and to the Senate.

"The

21
Senate shall have the sole power to impeach"

I mean the

22
House.

"The Senate shall have the sole power to try all im­

23
peachments ."

24
I think the history of the constitution shows that
,25

23

i

there was no intention to provide any other means for removina

a

a Federal judge from thebench„

3

their offices during good behavior and yet the Federalist,,

4

in its Number 78 and 73, devotes itself to proving how impor­

5

tant judicial independence is to the rights and liberties of

8

the people and how the constitution secures that»

Federal Judges were given

It talks then about the impeachment powers of the

House and Senate and says -- this is the only provision on the

9

point, which is consistent with the necessary independence of
the judicial character,

10

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:Kow, your argument is made

11

upon the premise that the Judicial Council has taken all the

12

cases away from the Judge.

13

MR. KENAN:

MR. JUSTICE STEWART: They did initially, but that

was superceded.

MR. KENAN:

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

understanding of that?

19

MR. KENAN: They did supercede it, but then they

20

kept hi.m from hearing any cases later filed in the court.

21

Furthermore, they pressured him into all of this, Your Honor.

22

They have been acting against him ever since —

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

that their @§%4©h takinor all eases away fromhim, was super­

Because of the continuation of the council to acts

U

because of the importance to the judiciary of whether they

could do this, since the judicial council merely has to super­

17

discretion of this Court to issue mandamus to the Judicial

18

Council to order them not to do this any more and to cease any

19

vestiges of its action against Judge Chandler, otherwise this

20

question can never be litigated.

21

MR, JUSTICE HARLAN:

To follow up on Justice

22

Stewart’s question, what is the exact situation of Judge

23

Chandler now.

24
25

Is he being assigned cases?

MR, KENAN:

His exact situation, Your Honor, is

that ha has the remnants of four or five cases tfhat had been

25

i

'5

assigned to him before this matter arose.

£

of those still in his office.

cases that have been assigned to him.

of his court have agreed that no further cases will be assigned

3

to him under the circumstances of this matter being before

this Court.

7

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

He has the remnants

He has heard the rest of the
He and the other judgesj

But that is at the order of the

8

Judicial Council, because at the time he agreed to that, he

9

disagreed with the assignment of cases that he already had.

10

He disagreed and the Judicial Council then entered an order,

11

didn't they, saying that he could keep his old cases, but that

12

he can't have any new ones.

13

MR.KENAN: That's correct.

14

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

15

Well, is that order still out­

standing?
■
MR. KENAN: That order was in effect until several
months ago, when the Judicial Council advised the other members
the other judges of Judge Chandler's court and him that if

19

they wished to enter into the. new order for the division of

20

business, they might do so.

21

stated thatunder the circumstances, they would allow the

22

existing order to' continue.

23

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

The judges considered it and

Well, let's assume that Judge

24

Chandler said, ” I want to be assigned my full quota of cases,*

25

and the other two judges disagreed and said, "Present division

Then there would be a disagreement.

MR.KENAN:

Section 137, is not authorised by Section 137 or is it your

position that if authorised by 137 then Section 137 is un­

that a judge could not have any new cases.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Ifyou assume that 137 does

would say that it's constitutional?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Let’s back that up a

little bit, Mr. Kenan..
Suppose you have a judge who has not decided any of
his cases for five years, and he's holding these cases and this
31

is an extreme case I ara suggesting in this hypothesis

not

2

your case here -- five years have gone by and he hasn't

3

decided any of his cases and the litigants are glamoring for

4

action and the other judges then on division first;, under

5

Section 137, decide that he gets no more new cases until

6

gets his old business taken care of.

7

responses previously were that that is a lawful power vested

8

in the courts.—

Now, I understood your

MR. KENAN,: Yes, sir.

9

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

10

Do you suggest that’s

a judicial power or an administrative power?

11

MR. KENAN:

12

I suggest that is a judicial power/

Your Honor.

13
14
15

16

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That they can do it

under the constitution?
MR.KENAN: Yes, sir.

I think that what is involved

there is a legitimate determination that a judge is overworked

17
18
19
20

under the circumstances; he has a crowded docket and he should
refrain temporarily from taking on new cases.

There we have

the facta supporting that, Your Honor.
In the case at bar, I contend we don't have the

21

22

facts supporting it and without the factual basis forit then

,

23
24
25

that make the difference between constitutionality and uncon­
stitutionally .

Your hypothetical is quite constitutionals,

until the judge catches up.

judicial duty of a judge was to try lawsuits.

Well, Your Honor, I don't know, to tell

you the truth.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

You know they are not trying a

case ? don't you?
MR. KEN MI:

Well, it may be that we should draw a

17

fin© line'hera, that with respect to future cases it is an

18

administrative decision because the judges' powers had not

19

yet been invoked, but with respect to cases already assigned

20

to the judge, removing through the judicial process, upon which

ORAL ARGUMENT BY CARL L. SHIPLEY, ESQ.

20

AS AMICUS CURIAE, FOR THE PETITIONER

21

MR. SHIPLEY:

Mr. Justice, and may it please the

22

Court:

In view of the lineup in which presentations will be

23

made, and our time situation, I would like to anticipate some

24

of the arguments of the Solicitor-General has -ihSilldeci in his

25

brief and some of the arguments which are presented by
35

I
i

1

z

Professor Wright in his brief inthis case»
I think that in considering the matter the Court

3

must necessarily bear in mind the long history involving good

4

behavior and the impeachment sections of the Federal Constitu­

S

tion, and measure Section 332 of the statute and the actions

6

of the Judicial Council in this specific case, against that

1

long history.

8

address themselves to that problem of the history, and we all

9
10

know that from the time that John Randolph in 1787 made his
ii
original resolutions respecting cur national judiciary and

II

the Co: tinental Congress when Mr. Dickinson moved that the

IE

good behavior provision should be modified to follow the

13

British pattern, that where an address by the Congress and the

14

Senate to the President, might result in the removal of a

15

Federal Judge, that this was rejected in favor of the inde­

16

pendence of the Federal Judiciary.

17

A part of these two briefs to which I refer

So, we recall that Thomas Jefferson, of course,

18

strongly supported the

19

impeachment and then a few years later we find that he was

20

criticizing impeachment procedures as not being adequate.

2!

<a ©f total independence except for

And against that background we have to look at

23

what has happened in this specific case. It can only be
*
characterized as outrageous. Here is a Chief: Judge of a

24

Federal District Court who has served with honor, with honesty,

25

with efficiency, for 26 years, and a chief judge for eight

22

36

i

years.

a

We know from public documents that are a matter of

3

public record in which in our brief we have asked this Court

4

to take judicial notice of, and which it properly can take

5

judicial notice of, and which it should take judicial notice

6

of; that there has been along friction in terms of jurisdic­

7

tion between what the Tenth Judicial Circuit thought it could

&

do, honestly, I suppose; in terms of Section 332 and Section

9

137 and Section 372; perhaps Section 371 of Tirle 28.

to
I!
12

tills friction has manifested itself ultimately in the final
order of the Judicial Council, which 'was not its first order
against this judge.
In the Solicitor-General’s brief there are

13

14
IS
16
17
18

IS
20
21
22

23
24

And

references to the Occidental Petroleum case and Texaco case.
They are referred to in the Judicial Council’s order, not by
name, but simply saying that the judge has beeninvolved in
soma criminal and civil litigation which has had some impact,
to speak of his attitude and his conduct and the efficiency of
the court, without any factual shov/ina as to how these relate
in anymanner to the difficulties any Federal Judge has over

j

many years in dealing with complciated cases and complicated
|
litigants.
I

The first question which concerns-me against this
historical background is the threshold question, as the
se!ieifcQE-General calls it,

whether this Court has

25
37

S;
5

1

jurisdiction,, which some of the Justices have raised.

z

Our position is that the Cotrt does have jurisdic­

3

tion under Section 1651 of Title 28, that being the All Writs

4

Act, which incorporates, as we understand it, and as we

S

understand it, the Solicitor-General understands it.

6

It incorporates the old Section 13 and 14 of the

7

original Judiciary Act of 1789 and although Judge McGruder,

8

and I guess, the Josephson case, perhaps, suggested that there

9

has been some change by reason of the revision of these older

10

sections into the present Section 1651, the All Writs Act.

n

We agree with the Solicitor-General that this court has

12

jurisdiction by reason of that act.

13

A second point I think I would touch on briefly, is

14

that in our brief we suggested that the Court had inherent

15

power, and we also mentioned that it has power under the due

16

process provisionis of the constitution, to deal with the

17

matter of this extraordinary significance in this context;

18

in this historical context, and in the practical immediate

19

context, because here these are live judges operating in a

20

very important circuit, where we have had a long, running

21

situation that's resulted in interference by somebody in the

22

operation of that court.

23

Our position is the Tenth Judicial Council has

24

unconstitutionally not impeached the judge and removed the

25

judge from the office, but they have removed the office from
38

1

the judge, in a kind of a reverse English procedure, which

a

Sea-tainly Congress could not possibly have intended, because

3

it would be unconstitutional, in our judgment on the face.

4

The provisions of the Federal Constitution relating

5

to this matter are so explicit in setting up a special court

6

in the Senate that

7

body is on oath and it names who the Chief Justice and pro­

8

viding officer shall be, and exactly what the procedures
I
shall be and the judicial proceeding to convict somebody.

0
10

requires a two-thirds vote; where nvery-

And all of these things, we think, come within the

ii

type of problem which is contemplated, yet can be reached

12

under Section 1651, under the Extraordinary Writs.

13

the writs for extraordinary circumstances„

14

judicial- 6©uncil here that energizes bringing the Section 1651

15

into play.

16

These are

The action of the

j

The inherent powers — we didn't just make up the

M

term — this Tenth Judicial Council, in three of the cases

18

cited in the' Solicitor-General's brief; and I say the

19

Solicitor-General's brief does not touch on this; it makes

20

reference to the fact they have never heard of this Court

2?

suggesting it had inherent powers; but in the Ritter case,

22

cited in the Solicitor-General's brief and the Texaco case

23

and the Occidental Petroleum case; all three, the courts there,

24

of the Tenth Circuit, said, "We are exercising our power under

25

Section 1651, or our inherent appellate jurisdiction." They

!

I

39

1

didn’t, care which and they specifically stated it in all

a

three cases.

3

And that's how they acted to issue extraordinary

4

writs against Judge Chandler in these three cases, which lie

5

at the

•

of the existing order, which we challenge.
I

6

Wow, the second problem that seems to me that we

7

are concerned with, is that the Solicitor-General, putting

3

a Slide Professor Wright's position that this Court has no juris­

9

diction, we follow the Solicitor-General on that.

We think

10

it does for the reasons he addresses himself-to and the

i1

reasons I have set forth.

1?.

The second problem is whether or not, and as I

13

understand the Solicitor-General’s brief, he said, either the

14

case is moot or Judge Chandler is estopped from being here

13

bfacausehe has agreed to the present division in his court.
On the question of agreement, we have cited incur

16
1/

brief that this was a kind — this was not the kind of an

18

agreement that can lead to estoppal; just as it was not the

19

kind of disagreement that would energise Section 137 of Title

20

28, that would energise or activate the statutory authority

21

whereby the Tenth Judicial Council could divide the business of

22

the court.

23

And on that point, let me say that I do not agree

24

that an exercise of Section 137 so extreme when it deprives a

25

judge of all these cases, is a constitutional exercise of that

40

i

i

authority.

z

are trying to do and it cannot be used to deprive a judge of

s

his office, any more than Section 332 can.

4

when it's activated properly, by a genuine and bona fide

3

disagreement to divide the business of the court so we can get

0

on with the judicial business of the nation.

7

Now, with respect towhefcher or not that first order,

the order we challenge, was moot, 1 simply call the Court’s

9

attention to the Grant case we cite, and to this Court’s own

10

this problem of mootness and I just have just a word --

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

15

MR. SHIPLEY; Yes, sir

16

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shinley, before you

You have now addressed

17

yourself to the possibility that certain actions under Section

18

137 might be lawful in the sense that they are authorized by

19

the statute,

20
21

If they are to get on with the business of the Court, but that
rc
in this case, you then raise the question of whether that was

22

the good faith purpose.

23

authorised by the constitution; I take it?

Are there any findings — has there been any deter­

24

mination by anyone we could review to determine whether they

25

were in good faith or in bad faith?

How would this Court

1

review that issue you are claiming?

a

MR. SHIPLEY; I think the Court simply has to look

3

at the record before it.

4

on the Tenth Judicial Council’s original order of December 13,

5

1965, where they said, and I quote direetlyfrom, the order:

6

"In the past four years the Judicial Council had many meetings,

court to deal with judges and their tenure, and just as the

behavior and when that question of good behavior is to be
resolved, the Congress itself must do it in a special court

Well, I think we have run out of our

to and I wanted to know when the time is up for our side.

11

Or if the Court please, another very important

12

question which has come up that the Solicitor-General, I am

!3

sure, will address himself to, is whether or not Judge

14

Chandler has agreed to the present division of business and by

15

this agreement — although the Solicitor-General doesn't use

W

the term, but he is estopped, whether or not by this agreement

\1

it makes the case moot or removes any cause for this court to

16

get into what the Solicitor-General called the "delicate

19

.question;"

20

332.

21

the constitutional questions involved in Section
’

.....

"

'

We have pointed out in our brief that Judge
'

22

Chandler’s agreement was not a bona fide agreement in the sensa

23

that the law had contemplated that it should be to estop him

from Complaining about something to which he had agreed.

25

agreement was simply — he put right in the letter -- that he
46

Kis

1

was signing under protest to avoid creating a disagreement

z

and that he would expect to address himself to the constitu­

3

tionality of the action, against Judicial Councils, as outlined

4

in our brief.

5

I see that my time is out and I will just close in

6

saying this:

7

scholars who have said that good behavior, attitude, conduct

8

in these matters are not gust issues; they are not just

9

questions that can be tried in any place except the Senate of

I do agree with Congressman Cellar and other

10

the United States, acting as a court of impeachment, in

n

accordance with the constitution.

12

And therefore, we would say this Court, in order to

13

clarify >-he matter, not to avoid what has been a delicate

14

problem, but tfa solve what's been 150 years of a complicated

15

problem and to speak forthrightly and completely and totally

16

so that the Federal Judges will know that, the Judicial Council

17

will know exactly where their authority begins and ends undef

18

Section 137 and under Section 332, because if this Court says

19

it doesn't have jurisdiction and steps away from this case, it

20

will compound what is a very serious situation which will con­

Zi

tinue in all the judicial circuits.

We don’t know whatWill happen, but certainly these are human

beings with the same personality frailties that have given,

rise to this case and brought all of us here today.

CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, BSQ.

ON BEHALF OF ,THE RESPONDENTS

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief JuSd.ce, and if the Court

j

6

please:

7

question Mr. Justice STewart put to Mr. Kenan, when he said,

8

"Will you agree that if the action of the Judicial Council was

9

administrative in nature, that this Court would be entirely

to

In my submission part of this case was in the

without jurisdiction to review the matter.

II

And Mr. Kenan answered that question in the affirma­

12

tive, an answer that I think is compelled by a line of

13

authority going back to Marbury v. MadisonB that unless the

14

proceeding that is broughfchere is judicial action by an

IS

inferior tribunal, then this Court is being asked to exercise

16

original jurisdiction and that it might do only in cases to

which the state are parties oj? ssha§§afi©.i?§ ©g consuld are

'

19

Mr. Kenan, having agreed with the basic premise?,

20

then suggestedthat in this particular instance the judicial

21

council acted in a judicial fashion, an argument.that I must

22

confess I have some difficulty in following.

23

Hir view, as I
an
understand it, is that: Congress intended to create/administra- !
'

I aqz~ee entirely;

tive agency called the Judicial Council.

25

it seems to me the legislative history is clear; that the
48

1

literature is all in one direction on this, that no one, so

z

far as I know, prior to the Solicitor-General9s brief inthe

case, has ever suggested that a Judicial Council is vested

MR. WRIGHT:

What we are arguing this morning is acase in controversy.

12

I submit that it is a case in. controversy that this Court

13

can't hear because it’s not within your original jurisdiction..

14

In my submission what the Judicial Council did,

15

whether the relevant order be that of December 13, 1965 or

16

as I think, February 4, 1966, was not a case in cor troversy;

17

that it bore none of the earmarks of a judicial determination.

18

As you have suggested, Mr. Justice Douglas, an

19

administrative action may lead to a case in controversy.

20

someone is dissatisfied with what an administrator has done

21

and then challenged that, but the appropriate place to challenge

22

that is in not in the first instance, the Supreme Court of the

MR. JUSTICE BLACK: 1 What’s the impeachment pro­

7

vision of the constitution — what purpose would it serve?

8

Like when a judge is deprived of his right to act as a judge?
MR. WRIGHT: I submit —

visions of thte constitution whereby he can only be removed by
impeachment.

This Court can — in Booth versus the

cases is not removal so long as theoffice and the salary conhinges, that the takina away of the right to try cases is not
barred by the constitution.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

And you mean this Court has

held where it was a point to be decided in a case —
MR. WRIGHT:

22
23

Well, that's not it?

United States, Shff©st@$ that taking away the right to try

20
21

I respectfully disagree, sir.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Removal is taking away the right to try cases.

MR. WRIGHT:

16

If he can’t rely on the pro-

No; it was dictum by Justice Roberts

in 291 U.S.
But„ the position we take, of course, is that this
Court has no

in this proceeding to decide whether
52

i

1

impeachment is* as seme people,, or is not, as others believe,

2

the only way that action can be taken against a Federal Judge»

3

We think that first you lack jurisdiction to hear

4

the case altogether; that Petitioner has misconceived the

5

proper forum in which to seek a remedy;
Second, we believe that if the Court had juris™

S
7

diction that on the merits it could not now reach the question

8

of whether or not the order of December 13th was an attempt

9

to remove Judge Chandler, or whether it was a proper order

10

but this Court does not issue advisory opinions about things

n

that have long since gone out of existnece, but the orders now

12

in effect are those of February 4, 1966, September, 1967 in

13

which the Judicial Council has provided that Judge Chandler

14

may hear the cases that Judge Chandler certified that he wants!

15

to hear.
Under the order of the Judicial Council anytime the

16
17

judges of the Western District agree on a new division, that

18

will go into effect immediately? if they disagree, they have

19

only to disagree, and it will go to a statutory power of the

20

Judiciary Council and it then resolves the disagreement.
The one time there was a disagreement, it resolved

21

22
23
24
25

the disagreement in the direction that Judge Chandler had
asked for, rather than the direction the otherjudges had asked
for.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE?
53

Well, Professor, what would you

t

say if there was a disagreement and there was a Council order

z

saying to a judge to first clean up all ©£ his cases before he

3

takes any more; that order goes into effect, and he does clean

4

up his cases.

5

other District Judges don't want a change in the order.

And then he wants a change in the order.

The

v

So there is disagreement and the Council then says ,

6
7

"We will leave

the order stand; no more eases."

8

the reach of 137?

Is that within

MR. WRIGHT: I submit that it is clearly within the

9
10

statutory power granted to the Judicial Council.

n

could then arise whether that particular form of exercise of

12

the power of the Judicial Council is constitutional.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

18

What about that?

A question

I know you

14

don't think that question is here, because there is no juris­

15

diction, but -MR.

16
17
18

becausethat’s

21

That is a

Do you think it's no different

— that the question isn't here because he still have the
remnants of five cases?
MR. WRIGHT:

And if he wants more cases he has only

to make that fact knovm.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

24

25

not this order, Justice White.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

22
2.3

I don’t think that question is here,

hypothetical case that might be immensely difficult.

19

20

WRIGHT:

Well, we don’t really know that,

do we?
54

1

MR. WRIGHT:

2

know it the other way.

3
4

No, we don’t know it; but we don’t

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:That’s why you take the position
the case isn't here?

That ease isn’t here.

5

MR. WRIGHT:

6

MR. JUSTICE MUTE:

Yes.
The rest would be if the

7

Judicial Council has got some authority to enter an order uoon

8

a dispute, but when it knows, as well as anybody else knows,

3

when a judge has tried his cases, or has only one or two left,

10

is it empowered-to leave its order, in effect, or should it

If

change it?

12

13
14

Is it qualified to just sit there and say well,
if the judges want to leave this order in, that they may.
MR. WRIGHT:

I suggest that the Judicial Council

15

has shown no inclination to follow the course of conduct,

16

Justice White, you suggested.

17

own initiative, noting that Judge Chandler had at that time,

18

only 12 cases left, suggests to the Judqes of the Western

19

District that they make a new division.

20

back and said, "No, the current division is agreeable to us."

21

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

The Judicial Council on its

The juderes reported

And so the Judicial Council

22

said, well, we will just leave our order in effect, even

23

though this means that Judge Chandler never gets another case.

24

MR. WRIGHT: We will leave the order in effect until

25

the judges decide that they want to change the division of
55

1

business.

2

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

If anyone disagrees with you,

3

as I do,. I think the question is here that you say is not

4

hare, in. your judgment is the action ©f the Council constitu­

3

tional?

6

MR. WRIGHT;

I. have no doubt, Mr. Justice Black,

7

that the present, orders of the Council are justified by the

8

constitution.

9

MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Are what?

10

MR. WRIGHT: Are justified by the const!tutiorkn

11

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

But suppose you are wrong about

12

what's here, as I think you are, and maybe — I don't know

13

whether any others will think so or not, but I do? was that

14

act of the Council constitutional?

15

MR. WRIGHT:

Given its overtly interlocutory nature]

16

1 tfoulc?. <5»«sy yes.

17

had purported to say, "Judge X, you may never again hear a

18

case."

19

I would have serious doubts if the Council

When the Council, as it represented to the Court,

20

through its Solicitor-General, said that 'this was intended

21

only to be interlocutory, until we could get a proper hearing

22

to the matter, I think that that temporary power may

23

constitutionally be --

24

25

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

You thinkthey could temporarily

strip the judge of his power to try cases, under the

56

I

constitution?

a

MR. WRIGHT:

3

MR. JUSTICE WHITE: Well, what about the initial

4

order of the Council? do you think there was some question

5

about that?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, sir.

Oh, I would think that if that was

7

purported to be a permanent order, that there would be the

8

greatest question about it on procedural ground alone, without

9

even reaching the substance.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Well, there wasn’t any expira­

tion date on it, was there?
MR. WRIGHT:

It said, "Until further order.”

And

then the Council then represented to this Court that it in­
tended to dispose of the matter promptly.

I believe that we

have to accept what the Council has said at its face value.
I think there are even some circumstances in whibh
constitutionally a judicial council or someone other than the
Senate, can tell a judge that he is not to hear any cases at
all in the future. I think that when there is a certification
under Section 372(b) and a new judge is appointed, the judge
who is found to be physically and mentally disabled under the
statute, becomes junior in seniority, but it would be un­
believable that a judge who has been found mentally disabled
to act as a judge, then would be free to hear cases.

And I

can’t conceive that that is what the statute contemplates;
57

1

that that is the practice or that that is what the constitu­

2

tion would require under those circumstances.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

3

You. mean that although the

4

constitution provides a way to remove judges, you think that

5

because the necessities might, in somebody’s judgment, re­

6

quire it, he could be removed without impeachment?

That's right.

The title of judge

away.
RM. JUSTICE BLACK:

You mean that the only way he

you think that is all our constitution means about the
independence.objective?
MR. WRIGHT: I think our constitution means a great
deal more than that, about the independence of judges, Mr.
Justice Black.

But I think that judicial independence :Ls a

quality that goes far beyond the veryllimited issues that are
here at. stake.

I think that judicial independence means that

nobody is to tall a judge how he is to SaO-ida a case; that he
V

is not to foe answerable except to the Appellate Courts for his
viewsoof the lax/.

Judicial independence means this and much
58

1

eiseff but. j do n0£ think that judicial independence means that
a person who has been found by a judicial council and by the

3

President of the United States, to be mentally unable to

4

function as a judge, should be permitted to go ahead and func­

S

tion as a judge.

6

MR. JUSTICE BLACK;

You mean that the President

7

of the United States? in your judgment, has the power under

3

our SeiiStitution to determine whether a judge is mentally able

9

to try his cases?

10

Is that what you are saying?

MR. WRIGHT;

I son saying exactly that? yes, sir»

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

Not this statute, but we're

talking about other statutes.

18

Well, that is precisely what

provides and again —

16
17

I think I understand you 'now. •-

MR. WRIGHT1:

This statute, X hasten to say, has no

relevance to this case.

20

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now, the legislative

21

history behind that statute indicates that Congress concluded

22

that there should be a-means of relieving the public and

23

the litigants from a disabled judge, short of impeachment,

24

but without taking the office of judge, or the salary, away

ZB

from feim?

59

1

MR* WRIGHT:

2

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

3

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.
And I suppose the constitu­

tion, in addition to providing for an independent judiciary,

4

also provides for a good many rather important things, and one

5

of them is the right of litigants to get due process of law

6

and presumably you can't get that from a mentally incompetent

7

or physically incompetent judge? is that correct?
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

8

Don't you think that a law

9

that is negligent enough to leave it to be determined by the

10

President of the United States a political officer, to decide

n

whether judges are able to hold their jobs?
MR. WRIGHT:

12

I believe that the constitution left

13

it tso the Congress to create procedures for these exigencies,

14

and the Congress did so many years ago in this Court, again

15

by way of dictura, in Booth, expressly spoken of that procedure

IS

as being a. constitutional.

17

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

MR. WRIGHT: That was by way of dictum, Mr. Justice

19

Was that decided?

Black.

20

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

It was not decided.

21

MR. WRIGHT:

22

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It was not decided.
But that statute is not

involved in this case.
MR. WRIGHT:

That statute is not involved in this

case, nor with respect in our view, are many of the matters

that we have bean discussing here.at oral argument.

3

What is involved in this case is an order resolving a dis­

4

agreement among the District Judges as to how the business

5

should ha divided and in my view it does not help us to speak

6

hypothetically of what the situation might be if some judge

7

ware to be told that he may not hear any cases.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

But he is a judge appointed for

so other judges, who are not more lifetime judges than he,

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

And in fairness to Judge Chandler,

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it must be said that on January

that he did not want to waive any of his rights to challenge
the then still-existing order of December 13th„
The September 1967 agreement said the present
provision was agreed on under the circumstances.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:
Professor Wright:

May I ask you this question,

Assuming that when the time comes when

judge Chandler runs out of business, the present assignments,
and that there is a disagreement among the District Judges as
to whether any more cases should be assigned to him, is there
anything to show on the record that the Circuit Council would
not step in and break that log jam?
62

1

MR. WRIGHT:

There is nothing whatever inthe record

2

to show that the Connell would not step in; there is nothing

3

whatever in the record to show that, the Council would not give

4

Judge Chandler whatever division he thought equitable.

5

I would be pure speculation,

6

to propose anything to

the contrary.

7

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Why doyou say that when you

a

admit that without his being there they passed the order they

9

did.

How can you say that?
MR. WRIGHT:

to

1 don't understand that.

I find it difficult, Justice Black,

It

understand how the fact that they met without him present on

12

December 13th says anything as to what they will do in the
a ,
future, in/parfcicuXaa hypothesis put to me by Justice Harlan.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

There has been a statement for

15

many years in which many people give some confidence: "'That

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Original jurisdiction does not arise out of

I have tried, with the aid of ray former associate, Philip

as possible.

25

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are, then, what is

sometimes referred to as a "True Friend of the Court."
MR. GRISWOLD:

A True Friend of the Court.

The first question to which T will address myself
67

1

is this Court’s jurisdiction of this matter.

a

of course, that the Court has jurisdiction only as an exer­

3

cise of appellate jurisdiction, that this case is here as an

4

original mattery it is obvious that neither the United States

S

nor a state nor a foreign minister or ambassador is a party

&

and there is no basis for original jurisdiction.
I may say that when I started consideration of this

7
8
9
10

II
12
13

ease I had the tentative view that there was no jurisdiction
here, that this was not an exercise of appellate jurisdiction?
that indeed, the arguments presented by Professor Wright was
the sound analysis.

20

I learned my Federal jurisdiction from

Professor Frankfurter and I tend to take a rather strict view
cf these matters and also to regard them as important.
But, after my associate, whom I regret, has now

14
15

It is plain,

left government service, Mr. Lacovara, presented me an elaborat
memorandum on the matter and I discussed it tvlth him at some
length.

I came to the conclusion that that was probably wrong.
I would like to make it plain that I do not regard

this as by any means a matter of black and white.

It will be

clearer after this Court has decided it than it is now.
It does not help, it seems to me, to say that this
is administrative actioni

That is an example of the tyranny

of words, because if this is judicial administration it may
present a situation which is different than anything with which
the Court has previously dealt.

It is, of course, fair and accepted in many fields

1
2

that it is the const!fcution we are dealing with and that the

3

understanding of the constitution grows and develops with the

4

development of problems and the approaches to problems.

had a very small conception of judicial administration of the
function and the responsibility of courts in seeing to. it
that their business is soundly and effectively handled, in
addition to the process of the actual decision of the case in
court.
Over the past generation there has been a great
expansion in the awareness of the importance of the function
of the judicial administration and we had people like Chief
Justice Hughes and Chief Justice Groner and Judge Parker and
Arthur Vanderbilt and others, who were ''argely responsible
for the development of the statutory provisions which now
exist, establishing not only the Judicial Conference of the
United States, which is not involved here in any way whatever,
but also the judicial councils.

MR. GRISWOLD:

No.

The statute says that the

chief judge of each circuit — this is Section 332 of Title
23, "shall call at least twice in each year and at such places
as he may designate, a Council of the Circuit Judges for the

12

Circuit, in regular active service at which he shall preside.

Sometimes not much opportunity for

which are done by the Court.
I would ilka to suggest that in Section 137 of
Title 28, the statute now reads that this is the last para­
graph of Section 137, "If the District Judges in any District
are unable to agree on the adoption of rules or orders for
that purpose, it now says the judicial council of the circuit
shall make the necessary orders.”

It would be only a verbal

difference if it said, "The Court of Appeals sitting in banc,
shall make the necessary orders."
Now, Section 332, the last paragraph, which is at

it said, "Each Court, of Appeals sitting in banc, shall make

MR. GRISWOLD:

And I could simply provide in the

statute that the court sitting en banc could be convened by

12

the Chief Judge for this purpose.

13

It still seems to me that what the court is doing;

14

what the judicial council is doing here is exercising what

15

has come to be recognized, not only as judicial power, but as

16

an important judicial responsibility, to see that the judicial

17

business of the circuit is effectively and expeditiously

18

administered.

19

This was hot an accident; it was not an arbitrary

20

action; it grew out of such experiences as those which Chief

21

Justice Taft lived through in the 1920s when there was no

22

such power and I just happened on a letter written by Chief

23

Justice Taft inthe 1920s, in Alphius Mason's biography of

24

Taft.

25

"Of course I write this letter with no assumption

17

it would very rarely be necessary to do anything to enforce

it.

19

for the Judicial Council to issue an order the odds were very

20

strong that it would be complied with, however reluctantly.

2?

But the statute does expressly give the Judicial

22

Council, which I repeat, is the Court of Appeals sitting en

23

24

make those orders and it provides that it shall be the duty

by examining the item which is Item K in the return of the
Tenth Circuity whichis a letter on the stationery of Judge
Chandler# signed by all five judges of the Western District
of Oklahoma# leading off with Stephen J. Chandler as the first
signature, addressed to the Tenth Circuit Judicial Conference
in response to the letter of the Honorable David C. Lewis to
the active judges of the United States District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma and the minutes of the meeting of
the Judicial Council attached thereto: "We advise that the
current order for the division of business in this district is
agreeable under the circumstances."

Now, Judge Chandler makes

a lot out of that "under the circumstances."

He refers tothe

17
fact that his previous letter in February 1966 by which he
13
19

20

joined with the other judges in agreement as to the division
of the business, was under protest.

He says that this is unde?

duress.
21

However, it seems to me clear that Judge Chandler
22
cannot haee it both ways.

He cannot either consent and not

consent at the same time. By this letter he has consented.

13

Yes, Mr. Justice.

that triggers this, it's the conduct; isn't it?
MR. GRISWOLD;

14

Yes, Mr. Justice, it is the statutory

15

responsibility of the Courts of Appeal sitting en banc and

16

thereby being known as the Judicial Council, to make appropriat e

17

order for the effective and expeditious handling of the

18

business of the District Courts and a situation where all of

19

the District Judges in a District failed to saesyfc their respon­

20

sibilities would clearly be a situation calling for the exer­

21

cise of that power.

22

Now, various things have been said about the order

23

\
which was entered by the Judicial Council in December of 1965.

24

That it was done without a hearing and without notice and so

25

on.
79

In our brief we indicate that we think that as of

that time it may have been difficult to support that action,

3

It was quickly explained as having been interlocutory and I

can conceive of situations where it would be appropriate for

imagine situations where it would be entirely appropriate for

14

For example, if a judge were indicted for having

accepted bribes in connection with his handling of cases and

17

he announced, "Well, who cares about that? 1911 be in court

19

I can imagine that it would be appropriate for the

20

judicial council to issue an order such as was issued here or

21

even stronger than was issued here, providing that he should

22

no longer — should not sit en. pending matters and should have

23

no new matters assigned to him until the indictment had been

disposed of.

application tothis; there is no threat or risk that the Tenth

5

6

inappropriate\

7

It is no longer in effect,

Since February 4, 1966 the only order that has been

8

outstanding has been one which is in entire accord with the

9

position of Judge Chandler,

Item 1: Judge Chandler agreed with

to

the judges of the District Court for the Western District of

Oklahoma that no new business will foe assigned to him, and

17

has to do is to tell his fellow District Judges that he doesn’t

18

agree and wants some cases assigned tohim.

19

He, thus, has exactly

If he thinks that isn’t all that

If his fellow judges do agree to assign cases to

20

him and he accepts that there will be no disagreement and there

21

will be no basis for the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council to act

under Section 137.

23

If, on the other hand, his fellow District Judges

24

donot agree then there will be a disagreement; it will be

25

appropriate for the Tenth Circuit to take whatever action may

that action would be.
