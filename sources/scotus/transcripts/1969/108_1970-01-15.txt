ORAL ARGUMENT BY O. JOHN ROGGE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROGGE:

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

8

Court:

9

tion to the single appendix of the Petitioner's brief and the

10

Government's brief, a blue-back Petitioner's reply brief.
This case presents the issue of whether the premises

11

12
13

14

of those whose services include the sale of alcoholic beverages,
are outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment.

17
18
19

The government points to inspection statutes; we
point to the provisions for a warrant.

22
23
24
25

The government points

to the age of the inspection provision; we point to the fact
that there has consistently been provision for a warrant pro­
cedure .
Now, as to the facts in this case there isn't a dis­

20
21

The govern­

ment says they are; we say they are not.

15
16

In this case the Court should have before it an addi­

pute.

On a Saturday afternoon a crew of four:: three Internal

Revenue Agents and a Nassau County Policeman came into the
Petitioner's premises and demanded to inspect them.
Petitioner is the caterer who, as part of his service,
dispenses liquor, and therefore, has a Federal Occupational

Liquor Dealers stamp that costs him $54.

2

Q

Was that annually renewable?

3

A

Yes.

4

Q

He has to get that every year?

S

A

That's my understanding if Your Honor please.

Nowafter they had inspected the public premises

they demanded to sea the nonpublic premises,, and without per­

There were four people, Mr. Justice Black,

They weren’fc seeking to collect taxes.

Q

I wondered what was the nexus between the

point you were making and the issue in the case.
A

j

What I really want to emphasize ed.1 the way

through, is that this is a general, exploratory search for
evidence and it was done without a warrant.
Q

But your point would be the same whether he had

a license or whether he didn’t have a license?
4

1

A

Weil, I assume that he has to have a license

2

in the public premises and the premises were open and they

3

could walk in and if they came in to see did he have the

4

license, they didn’t coxae in for that purpose, we wouldn’t

3

have any objection about that.

6

Nor were they looking for a distillery,

7

Q

Mr. Rogge, does the record show how they broke

3

the lock, what they used to break the lock with? was it some­

9

thing they had or something that was on the premises?

10

A

That 1 can’t answer because the record doesn’t

11

show, but it does show that they broke the lock.

12

have to rely on is the Petitioner’s affidavit.

13

in the government’s affidavit in opposition.

14

general statement, to which it had added one thing:

15

argument before District Judge Weinstein, government counsel,

16

and this is at pages 31-A and 32-A, states thatone of these

17

very agents was a bar mitzvah there the week-end before and he

18

saw what looked to him to have been refilled bottles? and so he

19

went andput in a routine complaint, which was being acting on

20

this following Saturday,

about that.

case to their knowledge where force has been used to gain entry

3

to the preraises of a retail liquor dealer.

4

but whethsrit was a hammer or crow bar, that I can’t tell you,

5

Mr. Justice.
Q

6

This is the only

So, force was used,

Well, my problem is as to whether they brought

7

the weapon in with them, the crow bar or whatever it was to

8

break it.

9

That's the only reason I was asking.
A

Well, that I don’t know, whether they picked

10

up a chair or something there to break it open.

There isn’t

11

any dispute but what force was used to break the lock; break

12

open the door.

13

Now, they weren’t seeking to look for an illicit

14

distillery, because if they had been doing that there’s an

15

express statutory provision which says that it shall be lawful

16

for them to use such force to gain entry as may be necessary.

17

25

Now, whatever may be the constitutional stat

s of that pro­

vision, they weren’t operating under* that.
They were simply, as 1 have stated, and I can’t
emphasize it too much, they were engaged in a general, explora­
tory search of the kind that was one of the factors involved
in the American Revolution, which was the kind of thing that
led to the adoption of the Foutth Amendment.

Now, the Fourth

Amendment contains no exceptions.
Q

There was a little bit more, or perhaps, more

accurately, a little bit less than an exploratory search?
wasn't it, Mr. Rogge?

Hadn’t one off theagents been on the

premises a week earlier and observed what he thought were
violations of the —

This was stated in argument before Judge

Weinstein and I'm prepared to say that that's part of the

recordbut there is nothing in the government’s affidavit in

opposition which say anything about that.

That's simply a

statement that government counsel, before Judge Weinstein, and

10

if true, then I say the government had a whole week to get a

Q

To get a warrant.

These premises were owned

by the catering company?

14

A

Yes

15

This wasn't a catering company that

a home or a club?

The way I have handled that is in the reply brief

10

in which I quote from Camara against Municipal Court.

11

hear the government counsel say that, warrant procedure couldn't

12

be used because — well, they go into various reasons for that;

13

one of them is that they have been advised by the North

14

Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic Regions that these inspections are

15

based on some reason to believe or suspect less than probable

16

cause.

I did

I don11 think that1s in here.

I, in response to that, point out from a paragraph

17
13

in the Court's opinion in Camara that the standard of reason­

19

ableness for probable cause will vary with the type of case

20

involved.
Q

Well, do you --- you just don't raise the issue

23

A

No, 1 don't.

24

Q

So, we should take the case on the assumption

21

22

25

here?

that there was probable cause for this search?

8

A

i

Yes»

In other words, and again* I'm taking

2

it* not from any affidavit* but from a statement in argument

3

before Judge Weinstin that one of the ajents had been there

4

the preceding Saturday and had seen whatlooked to him like

5

refilled bottles»

6

to probable cause, but that certainly seems to me to be enough

7

probable cause to get a warrant,
Q

8
3

Now* neither side has gone into what amounts

Well* even without that incident* would you

say that there was probable cause»

Would there have to be

10

some specific evidence about a specific establishment to

11

justify an entry?
A

12
13

Well* if there is a public part of the

premises in the daytime they could walk in* but' if they wanted
/

14

to break into something* I would say yes* there has to be

IS

21

22
23
24
25

'•

You wouldn't say that liquor inspectors could

get a warrant to justify telling the judge that "We want to
inspect»"
A

No; that's not enough,

Q

You wouldn't think that they were justified in

having a routine inspection of private quarters in a liquor
dispenser's establishment?
A

If the premises are open they can walk in*

but if they —
9

1

Q

Well, I know, but —

2

A

~ if they make a search, which is what these

3

gentlemen, five in number, wanted to do? yes, they have to go

4

before a judge which satisfies detached official, rather than

S

the agent in the field, and get a warrant to do that,
Q

6

Well, that isn8t what Camara and See said,

7

is it, Mr. Rogge?

8

warrant you had to have a specific information about an estab­

9

lishment which led you to believe that there was a violation on

10

Camara and See didn’t require that to get a

the property.
A

11

Well, as I read Camara against Municipal Court,

12

was that the standard of reasonableness would vary with the

13

particular type of case and that would surely be true of the

14

administrative inspections that agents of the Internal REvenue

15

Service engaged in this inspection would have to supply.
Now, neither brief has gone into just how that would

16
17

be spelled out in this particular case.

18

out and neither has the government.
Q

19

20

22

24
25

So, we will assume, then, that there "was

probable cause?

21

23

I haven't spelled it

A

Yes.

Q

Mr. Rogge, while we have yountopped for a

minute, let me suggest a possible hypothetical, possibly a
parallel.

Government grants licenses on a very limited basis,

as we know, for the production of atomic energy, privately.
10

1

Somewhere in that statutory scheme there are broad provisions

2

for inspection of the premises producing the atomic energy,

3

obviously, on a safety basis — I would assume that’s the basis

4

Would you say that the government inspectors, with a statute

5

permitting them to inspect any time, must have a warrant before

6

they can enter any part of the premises where atomic energy is

7

being produced?

8
9

A

Well, Mr. Justice, I answer that by calling

attention to the fact that there is a comparable provision in

10

the case of distilleries where the statute provides that agents

11

may enter —* government agents are supposed to have a key to

12

distilleries and they go in at any time and the statute

13
14

13
16
17

IS
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

specifically provides -chat if entry is denied they may

use

necessary force without a warrant, to get in.
Now, entirely apart from the question ~~ if you would
add to your case that the statute also says in the case of
these atomic plants that agents may enter,

1 mean, if yon

make the case comparable to that of distilleries and say that
the statute specifically provides that if entry is denied they
may use force to enter,

2 would say that 1 would have a great
i

deal of doubt about the constitutionality of that, but I would
equally say inthis case if you look at the statutory structure,
you wouldhave to come to the conclusion that under this inspec­
tion statute that result wouldrft follow, because, under this
inspection statute there are provisions for the forfeiture of
11

1

$500 for each refusal; there is another provision making it a

2

felony to obstruct Internal Revenue Agents in carrying out

3

their duties, but where the Congress had in mind a warrant

4

procedure, it specifically so provided and so it provided, and

5

this provision goes back — it was in the

6

revised statutes and it’s in the current Internal Revenue Code

7

of

8

9

violation of the revenue laws, specifically provides a search

Act; it's in

954; it’s in 26 U.S.S. Sec. 7302, which provides that if

10

warrant be issued as provided in Chapter 205 of Title

11

United States Code and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

12

Also a provision in two instances for the use of force in the

3
4

Congressional stcindards.

8 of the

There isone in the Criminal Code,

8 U.S.C. Sec. 3 09 which provides for the use of necessary

15

force in the execution of a warrant and there is another pro­

6

vision, one with reference todistilleries, which provides for

7

the use of necessary force without a warrant for the entry of

18

9
20
21

22
23
24
25

a distillery.

But there is no such provision with reference to

these inspection statutes.

And I say,

And I say, just as a matter of statutory construction,
this is now apart from the Fourth Amendment, but it’s a matter
of statutory construction.If you look a

this statutory scheme,

Congress never intended the use of force if entry was denied.
They intended the use of a warrant procedure «and there is
specific provision for a warrant procedure.
2

1

Nov, I'm not familiar with the atomic energy pro\

2

visions, but I would say this;- that if there was a specific

3

provision for entry without a warrant by the use of force if

4

necessary# you have something that3s comparable to what we

3

have with reference to distilleries.

I would doubt its

Arid if you have also in that statute# a provision for
warrant procedure, 1 might form an opinion, looking at the

statutory schema.

11

the Fourth Amendment protected it, X would.

12

that for this reason:

13

people have built a right of privacy which Mr. Justice Brandeis

14

in his dissenting opinion in Homestead called the "right to be

15

let alone."

16

Q

X would, if I could, come out by saying that
.And X would do

For the past 300 years or more, this

Well, does this right of privacy extend with

17

the same force to people whoare granted a special license to

18

engage in activities that the generality of people are denied,

19

as it does- to private homes and other circumstances?

20

A

I would say yes, if possible, unless X found

21

in the statutory scheme as X do with reference to distilleries,

22

a specific provision that they may enter without a, warrant, by

23

force if necessary.

24
25

But I would look for a provision like that and not
only because we have built up this right of privacy '

13

1

of which the Fourth Amendment, as this Court has repeatedly

2

pointed out is an expression,, but you have had another develop­

3

ment, which began, really, in 1864 and that is giving to

4

administrative officials ■— it began with a Federal tax assesso:

in 1864 —• giving them power to issue a subpoena or power to

22

Q

You haven't covered it?

23

A

No.

But I do want to make another pint in

24

that connection.

With reference to applying the warrant pro­

cedure in this case, which the government says would be

14

1

so burdensome, according to the government's own brief the

2

government conducts thoUs^M© of inspections.

They go on to point out in a footnote that the

10

estimate of the refusal rate in the NQrth Atlantic Region was

12

they do say this in footnote 26, on page 30;

that this is the

only case, no their knowledge, in which force has been used.
Now,it can't be s© important to haves an inspection

They say that the area supervisors of the

is.

need to convert inspection procedures into general warrants in
order to carry out their duties.

Yes .

And that perhaps had a tendency to induce

cooperation?
A

I don't know about that, Mr, Justice.

I

don't know how many knew this

that it was a felony, but there are ample tools to deal with

really asking for here is not to make an exception to the
Fourth Amendment.

I don’t think the framers intended it.

The

framers, in just so many words, said, "The right of the people
to be secure as against unreasonable searches and seizures,
shall not be violated. "
Now, I say, if they wanted to make an exception for
liquor dealers or for distilleries, they would have said so.
They didn't.
And then they go on to provide —
Q

You don’ t tiink that had anything to do with

determining whether a search was reasonable?
A
Q
A

That they were liquor dealers?
Yes.
If Your Honor please, I see no such exception

in the Fourth Amendment.
Q

I'm not talking about exceptions; I'm talking
16

about the interpretation of the word "unreasonable searches."

Can you see no difference in searching a private home, far

3

removed from anybody else and the searching of a place where

4

they sell liquor?

The language of the amendment that you were

paraphrasing, I don’t suggest you were undertaking to quote it,
refers to the right of people to be secure in their houses and
persons, and as Mr. Justice Black suggests, that might be quite
different from a factory or other places.
A

It says "persons, houses, papers and effects.'8

But Mr. Justice, I now have See against Seattle, which says that
the Fourth Amendment protects commercial premises, and what I’m.
urging is — what I’m urging in the first place is that this
Court at this late date should not read an exception into the
Fourth Amendment which says that those who, as part of their
services, dispense liquor, their premises are without the

protection of the Fourth Amendment.,

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JEROME FEIT, ESQ,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, FEIT:

13

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please the

14

Court?

I'd like at the outset to point to the specific

15

statutory framework under which the agents proceeded in this

16

case.

17

26.5146(b) of the Code,

That's set forth in page 37 of our appendix.

Title

It says:

"Entry of preraises for inspection the Secretary or

18
19

his delegate may enter during business hours* the premises*

20

including places of storage of any dealer for the purpose of

21

inspecting or examining any records or other documents required

22

to be kept by such dealer under this chapter and any distilled

23

spirits* wines or beer kept or stored by such dealer on such

24

premises,"

25

Two things clearly emerge from this statute.
18

We are

Iji

not here talking about breaking of outer doors at all» These

2

arepremises which are open to the public.

3

the occupational stands tax as paid by the bar owner, the pack­

4

age store in Colonnade Catering Corporation, services parties

5

and the actual inspection here occurred when the officers

6

entered the premises with the consent of the employees there in

7

charge? made an inspection of the public area, and what we3re

8

talking about here is the breaking of a storeroom in the base­

9

ment, which is admitted no one was in there, except liquor

10

The excise tax or

bottles.

11

Now, contrasting that situation with See and Camara,

12

as this Court will recall, both See and Camara dealt with broad

13

housing and fire code provisions®

14

provisions on page 18 of our brief, note 16, which gave wide

15

discretion to the agent in the field.

16

'

We have set out some of these

As this Court pointed out, neither the resident in

1?

Camars nor the owner in See, had any way of knowing whether the

18

inspection of the premises wap required to enforce the erd™

19
20

authority, did not know when the inspectors attempted to gain

2!

entry stemming from proper authorisation.

22

I

inanca, did not know the nature of thfc limits of the inspector "1

Indeed, it is only by facing criminal prosecution,

23

the Court went on, that the validity of the entry could be

24

put to a test, and even then the owner of the preraises or the

25

occupant might never learn the reason for the entry.

19

And this

that was precisely the kind of unfettered expres­

2

sion of the officer in the field to invade private premises

3

that required antecedent justification by a mutual judicial

officerP as to the limit and make precise and give official

5

sanction to the entry.
The Court went on in Camara to say "broad statutory-

6
7

safeguards were no substitute for individualised review in this

8

context,"

9

opposite end of the spectrum.

10

As we have noted, this statute is clearly the

Amendment, itself, can require it under the warrant procedure.

14

These agents have no authority to roam at large for

15

anything else, but liquor bottles and to examine the specific

16

records which the dealer has to keep.

17
18

As a matter of fact, in the 1791 statute, which was
enacted the year the Fourth Amendment, which authorised inspec­

The Court, in Camarti and See, noted further that
|xh®re was no showing or even any argument in those cases that a
warrant system would in any way hamper effective implementation
of these municipal codes.

20

And finally* it observed, "there were manageable,

large ballroom.

What I am suggesting is that in this case the

10

agents entered this entry hall.

The record shows that at that

time they were authorised and permitted to inspect the general

area of the ballroom.

That was not open to the public? but our

position is that a retail dealer in liquor in an industry that* s
been regulated since much before the foundation of this
Republic? who? under New York law? must be licensed under a
comprehensive system? who pays an annual occupational tax of
§54 and receives each year a booklet which indicates grr^Qisely
the authority of the Internal Revenue Agents to inspect
premises during business hours for liquor.

not be reasonable in terms of a home.
It is true, Your Honor, precisely, that the Fourth

banking hours, usually they come in in teams? one of them goes

to the main cash drawer and one of them goes somewhere else?
