MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

OH BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

S

MR, SCHWARTS:

Mi". Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

7

In yesterday's session of the Court, there was some

8

question propounded to counsel for the petitioner by Mr.

9

Justice White.

10

I would like to address myself, for a couple

of moments, to those questions and answers.
One of the questions propounded to counsel was

11
12

whether or not the remedies afforded the parties, under the

13

present posture of the law, was reciprocal,

14

as it stands today, the parties to the collective bargaining

15

agreement do have — there is no disparity between the parties,

I can state that,

All the Norris-LaGuardia Act does is prevent either

16
17

of the parties to get a judicial order against the other for

18

conduct that they may find is to be an alleged violation of the

19

Act.

20

from getting a judicial order in order to force or require the

2?

other party to comply with a provision in their agreement,

22

affording an opportunity for a voluntary adjustment o£ their

23

proceedings.

ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. SCHWARTS

We will now resume Wo, 768.

I

The Norris-LaGuardiu Act does not prevent either party

Q

I am not sure I track you on that.

A

The Norris-LaGuardia simply prevents either of

\5

1

the parties to the collective bargaining agreement to get a

2

judicial order from any court.

3

Q

Prevents them?

4

A

Prevents them to do that, yes.

The only

5

exception is it does afford the parties an opportunity to go

6

to a court to compel arbitrations, which is a matter set forth

7

between the parties, a voluntary method

Q

for them to adjust

is violated by the union.

II

A

The no-strike clause in the contract

12

Q

Does or does not the Norris-LaGuardia Act bar

13

any court from enjoining a strike in violation of the no­

14

It does bar federal courts from enjoining the

Q

Why doesn't it bar 'the order to arbitrate.

A

‘Why does it not?

Q

You are simply enforcing a term in the contract.

A

You are enforcing a term in the contract, but

We have a situation —

the parties have agreed upon a method of adjustment of their
disputes in their collective bargaining agreement.

If you

had an injunction or a temporary restraining order prior to the
arbitration, you have taken away from the parties the rights
that they have agreed

upon and bargained for in their collective!

They have bargained for — and this Court said so

in the Steelworkers5 trilogy — they have bargained for the

collective bargaining agreement.

It, in effect* takes away any of the powers the
arbitrator may have in settling that dispute.
Q

Well, if they have agreed on an arbitrator to

settle the dispute, why does the union strike?
A

The strike situation is; no different than the

12

employer himself violating the contract by, say, discharging

13

some employees or by bringing in, as he did in this case, a

14

crew of non-bargaining unit people into a store to do bargain'

They make the allegation that their damages are not

2

sufficient, not adequate.

say the argument is the same on the other side of the fence,

but both the employer and union have bargained for this.

They say the damages cannot be

Both of them have bargained for the fact that they

1

will submit it to arbitration.

8

they will go to court for it, and they know they couldn't.

9

They have not bargained that

The very fact of the matter is this:

Both of the

10

parties here rely upon the expertise of the arbitrator.

11

the reason they do so is because of the federal labor policy,

12

recognizing — as this Court did in Lincoln Mills and the

13

Steelworkers3 trilogy — that it is a different type of field.

14

It is a type of field that courts do not have the expertise

IS

that is required in order to resolve the matter.

16

Q

And

What is the value of a no-strike clause in the

17

contract, if the no-strike clause permits a strike, on your

18

theory?

19

A

1

might, point out to Mr. Chief Justice that

20

there may be strikes in a shop or in a store that may not

21

necessarily be a violation of a contract.

22

those situations where employees may walk off the job be cause

23

of unsafe conditions.

24

no-strike clause, and the Court has held so.

25

where there may be an unfair labor practice —

For example, we have

That would not be a violation of the

29

We have situations

i

Q

We don't have that here though,, do we?

z

A

Ho? I am responding to the question you asked

3

about, the strike situation.

4

we have to take into consideration.

5

But we do have these things that

There is always an allegation that it is a violation

6

of a contract.

7

to subcontract work, which is to be performed by bargaining

8

unit people, that is an erosion of the contract.

9

has the same effect in regard to irreparable injury as we have

10

If the employer brings in people to do work,

And it

on the other side of the fence in regard to the employer.
I simply say to this Court that there is a remedy.

11
12

To say there isn't a remedy isn’t so, because in Section 301(b)

13

expressly states -- that Section 301 provides for a lawsuit

14

for damages to

be given against the union.

Now, when counsel says he doesn’t feel that that is

15
16

an adequate remedy, I can only say that a union, a labor

17

organization, is no different from any other institution.

18

have to have a treasury the same way any other institution has.

19

If they run into a situation where the treasury is depleted,

20

they are pretty much out of business.

They

So that to say that it is not adequate-"- It may not

21
22

be satisfactory? it may not be totally satisfactory to the

23

employers, because the employers may like the idea of having

24

this injunctive relief.

25

Because

But that doesn’t answer the question.

if the employers felt that way and if, based upon
30

t

the Sinclair decision, they felt that way strongly, from 1962

2

to the present time — when this Court decided that the Sinclair

3 ; Case and Norris-LaGuardia was not repealed by Section 301, was

j

4

not intended by Congress to be repealed — it seems to me it,

5

more or less, was a mandate to the parties believing that 'the
!

6

decision was wrong

7

be, that the party should have gone to Congress and should have

8

told Congress, "We feel that the Norris-LaGuardia should be

9

repealed."

or that the law was wrong, whatever it may

It makes it very difficult for me to understand this,

10
11

because in the Sinclair Case and in the legislative history of

12

the Sinclair Case, we have the late Senator Taft — who cer­

13

tainly was a man skilled in -this field — when he cams out of
I

14 I the caucus committee onto the Senate floor, he pointed out that
15

j Section 301 did not prohibit all strikes.

He pointed out that

16

; Section 301 did not repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

He

17 I! specifically said that the only two types of strike activities
j
that would be illegal would be the secondary boycott strike
18
19

and the jurisdictional strike.
Those two aspects and those two strike activities

20
21

were put in Section 301 of the Act, giving the National

22

Labor Relations Board, making it a mandatory injunction

23

on the Board to go ahead and take this action, not the private

24

litigants„

25

If you recall in the legislative history, in the
31

1

House billy there was a provision to make Norris-LaGuardia

2

not applicable to Section 301 cases.

3

of the committee that Congressman Hartley, who also was a

4

co-author of the bill, pointed out, specifically, that this

5

aspect of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was dropped in the conference

6

committee.

It was after he came out

7

Now that, it appears to me — and it was cited by

8

the majority opinion in this case ~ if 1 were on the other

9

side, I would take that as a mandate to me to get to Congress

10

arid have Congress change the law if they didn't feel it was

11

equitable.
Now nothing has

12

happened from 1962 to the present

13

time.

There has been no legislation in Congress in regard

14

to this.

15

reconsideration to -the Sinclair aspect.

There is no judicial determination which award any

I think it is very, very important that we realise —

IS
17

When counsel was asked yesterday the question as to what the

18

status in regard to the business community was since Sinclair

19

was enacted, counsel pointed out that there has been very little

20

activity.

21

AFL-CIO, they have a statistic from the U, S. Department of

22

Labor, where they show in 1961 — which is prior to Sinclair —

23

there was 10.8 per cent of man idle hours due to strikes during

24

the term of a collective bargaining agreement, 1961.

25

As a matter of fact, in the brief of amicus curiae

32

I

1

In 1968, according to the same brief, they show

2

8.1 per cent of the man hours idle during the term of the col­

3

lective bargaining agreement.

4

This is not to say that because of Sinclair there was

5

a reduction, but I simply say that there was no real impact of

6

the Sinclair decision on the business community.

7

from reading the briefs of amici and petitioner, it makes it

8

appear that there is some real reason for changing the posture

9

of the lax-?.

10

Apparently,

So far as we can determine here, there doesn41 seem

11

to be that reason.

12

collective bargaining agreements have, apparently, found that

j

13

this method of voluntary arbitration, picking arbitrators with

14

the expertise, is a desired way, along with the fact that the

15

federal labor law has recognized the fact that arbitration is

16

a matter for the experts in this particular field.

17

run into all sorts of complexities in the contract.

Wouldn't it be helpful to the total of industrial

the union could go into the federal courts and get an injunction

If we would do that, Your Honor . when you

that to you very simply by pointing out the difference; —-

13

A

Well, there we have again exactly what I was re­

14

ferring to, just your own comment Mr. Chief Justice where you

15

say in accordance to the contract whatever they are.

Court has said that the person who can best determine whether

17

or not it is a violation of the contract is the arbitrator.

18

This

It is because he works in that field day and night.

19

He becomes the expert in the field.

20

and time again that the type of economy and the type of labor-

management relations requires soma sort of expert.

It seems

to me that that change has to be performed by Congress and not
by judicial legislation.

opinion in regard to cases,

I recognise the fact that they are

not necessarily bound by prior decisions.

a policy change of a matter left open by Congress.

to me that what the Court said in Sinclair that, they are

12

Q

Except that this case involves, not Sinclair

13

directly, does it, but. rather the situation that the Court dealt

14

with in Idle Avco Case?

13

A

I don't believe so.

16

Q

I understand that 'this was originally brought in

17

the state court and -then moved to the federal court and that,

18

in the federal court, the order previously of the state court

19

was set aside.

20

A

Am I mistaken about that?

No, it was not.

The federal court granted its

21

own injunction — the federal district court ~ and on the

22

appeal to the circuit court, the circuit court reversed on the

23

basis of Sinclair.

24
25

Q

Well, I know the Court of Appeals did on the basis

didn't we?
A

Well, the way I understand it, Mr. Justice

IS

Stewart, in the Avco Case, all the Avco Case decided was a

17

matter of removal.

18

to a federal court, there is no remand.

19

And at that point it took care of the problem.

And that is all

Beyond that, in

the Avco Case, it so happened

A

Am I wrong about that?

No, you are correct.

As a matter of fact, when

7

counsel for the petitioner was arguing this case, it sounded

8

as if he was not concerned with Sinclair, but he is unhappy

9

with Avco.

As a matter of fact, in his reply brief, it seems

10

to me that he is unhappy with the entire arbitration proceed­

15

ings, because, in citing this one case where we have talked abort

12

the quickie arbitration, counsel points out -that, while the

13

contract called for 72 hours and then a 12 hour decision, he

14

said, “Well, my God, it took 4 days for a hearing.”

15

how long would it fake if he went to court?

As 1 mentioned previously, I can find no

we have today — so under those circumstances it seems to me

that the Sinclair Case should not be reversible.

In the very brief time remaining to me, I would like

to make 2 or 3 points.

16

statements and the contentions that have been made on account

17

of the failure of Congress to act following the decision of

this Court in Sinclair and, also, with respect to the idea that

19

Sinclair has some kind of a. stare decisis impact.

I would like to direct -die Court’s attention to a

On page 118 of the Official Reporter, if ’the Court

This case involved a situation where there had been 3 different
