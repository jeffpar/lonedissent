ARGUMENT OF PHYLXS SKLOOT BAMBERGER, ESQ.

7

OK BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MRS. BAMBERGER:

Thank you, Year Honor.

9

This case raises the question as to whether the

10

petitioner’s right against self-incrimination was violated by

1!

compliance with Title 26, United States Code, Section 4705, and

12

the regulations enacted by the .-Department of the Treasury pur­

13

suant to it.

14
15
16

That section is the narcotics order form provision
of the Harrison Act.,
Petitioner9s position, one that is apparently not

17

disputed by the Government, is that the order form procedure

18

or scheme necessarily includes record-keeping aspects and infor­

19

mation-keeping aspects, and that to a person such a petitioner,

20

this must result in the disclosure of information which is

21

available to law enforcement officers, both State and Federal,

22

and which can provide a link in the chain of criminal prosecu­

23

tion for violation of Federal and State narcotics laws.

24
25

The facts in the case are simple.

There were two

sales of heroin by the petitioner to a Federal undercover
2

1

narcotics agent.

2

form to the petitioner for the sale and the defendant was

3

sentenced to the minimum mandatory term of five years on each

4

county to run concurrently.

The narcotics agent did not supply an order

I think before a discussion of the legal question

5
6

comes up that we should discuss the scheme of the statute as

7

it specifically relates to the order form provision.
A person who is registered to deal in narcotics and

8
9

has paid an occupation tax can apply to the Treasury Department

10

for order forms.

These order forms, a copy of which is printed

11

as Apppndix C to the petitioner's brief, comes in a book of 10,

12

in a bock which looks like this (indicating).
The order form is what is called "executed" by the

13

14

potential buyer of narcotics; that is, he puts his name and

15

address on the order form and he lists the narcotics items that

16

he would like to buy.

The form is issued in triplicate.

He

17

then submits the original and the triplicate to the potential

18

buyer.

19
20

2!
22
23
24
25

The buyer must supply the order, and on this order
form he must indicate the amount of drugs that he has supplied
and the date on which he supplied them.
Prior to the time that this order form is given to
the buyer, or at least at the time of the sale, the seller's
name and address must be entered on the front of the order form
No provision makes clear who has the responsibility of filling
3

1

in the seller's name and address, but it is clear from Regula­

2

tion 151» 185 -that the seller doss have the obligation of supply-'

3

ing on the order form the amount of narcotics that he sells and

4

the data on which the sale is made.
The original and triplicate of the form are retained

3

6

by fcha seller.

The duplicate is retained by the buyer of the

7

narcotics.

8

to the Treasury Department.

9

possession for two years, and curing that time the order form

One of the copies retained by the seller is sent
He must keep the other copy in his

10

is available for inspection by any Federal or State law enforce­

11

ment official.
The self-incrimination aspect of the order form ob­

12
13

viously is that the seller himself must write on the order form

14

the amount of narcotics that he supplied and the date upon which

15

he supplied it.

16

information concerning violation of 21 U.S.C. Section 173, 174,

17

which is the illegal importation of drugs, the Section 4704(a),

18

which is the transfer of drugs outside of the original stamped

19

package.
Of course, there are violations of State statutes

20
21

22
23
24
25

That would give law enforcement officials

as well, and since this transaction took place in New York, it
is important to note that the New York narcotics statute makes
it a felony to deal in heroin of more than an eighth of an
ounce,
So the order form provision would reveal to State

4

?

officials that the petitioner in this case committed a felony

2

as well as a crime»

3

Q

The order form is here in Appendix C to your

S

A

That is correct.

S

Q

And the purchaser fills out, presumably, his

4

brief.

7

name and all that information which is to be filled in by pur

8

chaser.

9

A

That is right.

10

Q

You say the vendor must fill in what?

11

A

The last two columns in the middle section of

12

the order form —

13

Q

To be filled in by the consignor.

14

A

By the consignor, which is the vendor under the

15

scheme.

IS

and the data on which the packages ware supplied.

17

reference it would indicate that he did supply narcotics on

18

the date and in the amount that he supplied them.

19
20

He would have to fill in the number of packages first,

Q

Of course, bj

He fills in the number of packages furnished and

the date filled, it says.

21

A

Right„

22

Q

And then does that show the amount, because it

23
24

25

doesn't say "packages”?
A

Well, the number of packages would indicate the

amount of the packages, or by weight.
5

1

Q

A catalogue number over there on the left.

2

A

Right.

3

Q

Who signs it down there,. "Narae of Person or Firm

4

If Not An Individual ?

3
S

A

The buyer would sign it, but the vendor's name

appears on it.

7

If I may direct Your Honor's attention to the two line;

8

just above the spaces for the drugs involved in the transaction,

9

it says "To" and "Street".

10

Q

That is addressed to, by the purchaser; right?

11

A

That is addressed to the seller.

It is unclear

12

who has to fill that information in.

13

or statuta which indicates who fills that in or When it has to

14

be filled in.
Q

15
16

to.

There is no regulation

But the preposition ”To,! means it is directed

It is objective, not subjective.
A

17

That is true. Your Honor, but even if it ware to

18

be filled in by the buyer of . the narcotics it wouldn't make

19

any difference, because it would be the seller himself who

20

would have to reveal the fact that ha sold the narcotics and

21

the date on which he sold it, the number of packages that he

22

furnished.

23

Regulation 151.185 specifically states that it is the

24

vendor of the narcotics that must fill in that information.

25

the form, even assuming that the buyer of narcotics would be
6

So

1

the parson to fill in the seller's name, the seller's name would

z

be revealed by the order form and the seller himself would have

3

to supply information concerning the sale, and that is suf­

4

ficient.- in my understanding of the prior cases of this Court,

5

to reveal incriminatory information which could be used or

6

could supply a sufficient link in a criminal prosecution.

7

Q

Still, Mrs. Bamberger, it is true that the iden­

S

tity of the seller who has to fill in the quantity of the stuff

9

that is sold is supplied by the purchaser, and not by the seller,

fO

isn’t it?

11

the cases you are relying on?

Isn't that the crucial thing from the standpoint of

A

12

I don't think so, Your Honor, because if only

the seller's name were to appear on the form, without any indi­

13
/

14

cation that a sale had actually taken place, there would be no

15

incriminating information.

IS

information that deals with the sale itself.
Q

17

The incriminating information is the

Right, but if the form reached the authorities'

18

possession in some way with the information only that the form

19

calls on the seller's supply, there would be a lot of informa­

20

tion without indicating any identity of the seller, wouldn't

21

there?

That would be the only thing on it, wouldn't it?
A

22

We have to assume, Your Honor, that the order

form has been properly filled out.

23
24

25

Q

This is filed by the purchaser?

A

Filed by the seller of the narcotics.
7

{

1

Q

That is an independent requirement,, isn't it?

2

A

Yes, it is,

3

Q

That he has to file it?

4

A

Yes.

5

6
7
8
9

He has to keep a copy and he has to file

the second copy with the Treasury Department.
Q

He isn't being prosecuted for that, is he, for

failing to file?
A

In this case he is not being prosecuted for fail­

ing to file.

10

Q

He is being prosecuted for selling without re­

11

ceiving an order form.

12

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

As the Government

13

concedes, once tha idea is established — and that is the thrust

14

of our brief, a point which is not disputed by the Government —

15

that receiving the order form puts the obligation upon the buyer

16

in the sale to give the required information that the risk of

17

self-incriminafcion comes into play.

18

One of the Government's argum ants in its brief is that

19

Q

It seems to me he couldn't be prosecuted for

20

failing to fill it out and file, but does it mean he can't be

21

prosecuted for not getting an order form at all?

22

A

I don't know if I am misunderstanding Your Honor.

23

Q

The law requires him not to sell without receiving

24
25

an order form.
A

That is correct.
8

I

Q

And after he receives it, he is supposed to fill

3

A

That is correct.

4

Q

He is prosecuted for not receiving the order fori?

A

That is correct, because once he receives the

8
9

Q

Receiving the order form doesn't incriminate him

A

Mo, but receiving the order form requires, or

at all.

10

11

puts the obligation on him to give the required information.

12

Once he has given that required information, he has violated

He hasn't incriminated himself at all until he

sold is also on the duplicate held by the buyer of the narcotics

17

Q

The buyer doesn't have to file it.

18

A

Mo, but the buyer has to hold it for two years

19

and it is subject to the inspection of any Federal or State lav/

20

enforcement agent, so even if a copy is not filed, the infor­

21

mation would be available.

22

Q

23

is selling.

24

A

25

The charge is selling without filing.

The charge

He is charged with selling without an order form.

That is correct.

1

2

Q

And his only defense is that if he files the

order form, he will incriminate somebody»

3

A

No, his defense is that because the receiving of

4

the order form and the record-keeping requirement associated

5

with the order form must be treated as a unified scheme in order

6

to carry out the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute;

7

that by receiving the order form he is compelled to give the

3

information and, therefore, he would be incriminating himself.

9

Under the Leary decision, defendant does not have to

10

initiate the action that will ultimately result in self-incrimi­

11

nation.
Q

12
13

the drugs.

He initiated the selling of

That is what he was doing.
A

14

He didn't initiate.

Let me change the language of that statement.

15

Under the language of Leary, the defendant does not have to begi n

16

the legal process? that is, obtaining the order form which would

17

ultimately result, if he followed the scheme, as intended by

18

Congress.
Q

19
20

incriminate him?
A

21

22

25

Yes, because then he would be obliged to give the

information under the statutory scheme.
Maybe an explanation as to the scheme and the purpose

23
24

Do I understand you that to obtain it would

of the scheme might be helpful here, and that is point C of our
brief.
10

The Harrison Act was originally enacted as a taxing

1
2

scheme in order to control the flow of narcotics and to assist

3

the States in enforcing their narcotics statutes.

4

was enacted in 1914«,

The scheme

The order form provision was enacted as part of the

5
S

scheme in order to assist the Government in collecting the taxes

7

which it had imposed on narcotics transactions., and to avoid,

3

or to assist in determining who was involved in a narcotics

9

transaction attempting to avoid payment of these taxes.
So the order form provision is an integral part of

to

n

the total scheme of the taxation and, treated merely as a means

12

for physically transferring the narcotics from the seller, to

13

the buyer, does not satisfy the statutory scheme.
The record-keeping aspects of the order form provision

J4
15

are crucial in carrying out the scheme in order to help the

16

Government collect its taxes and in order to determine who is

17

evading the tax provisions.
Q

Assuming he applied for the order form, period.

19

A

Assuming he asked the Government agent for the

20

order form?

18

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Period.

That is all.

Could he be convicted of

A

Without making any sale?

Q

That is right.

A

No.

anything?

No.

11

1

2

Q

But if he applies for the order form and makes

the sale, then what happens?

3

A

If he applies for the order form and doesn't

4

get it, and makes the sals, then he is prosecuted under Section

5

4705.

6

Q

What right has been violated there?

7

A

The same right? that if he got the order form he

S

would be compelled to give the information which would incri­

9

minate him under —Q

10

Would he be charged with not filling out the forn

n

or charged with selling without it?

12

wi th?

What would he be charged

13

A

Ee would most likely be charged with making the

14

sale without the form.

15

the form, the statute would come into play only if he asked for

IS

and received the order form and failed in some way to supply the

17

information.

It seems to me that failure to fill out

18

Under our theory of the case, it doesn't make any dif-

19

ference, because under either section ha would be prosecuted for

20

not giving the information and, therefore, being forced, if he

21

did give the information, to incriminate himself.
Q

22

If he were not in the business, and was contem­

23

plating going in business, and got the form, how could he be

24

incriminated, because he might change his mind and not go into

25

business?
12

1

A

This Court, I think, has already answered that

2

question in the Marchetti series of cases»

3

case, the Government argument was that a person who registers

4

under the gambling tax statute can always choose not to become■

5

a gambler and, therefore, he would not be incriminating himself»

S

This Court, rejected that theory ors the grounds that that didn’t

7

have to be his choice.

8

self or not to violate the law.

9
10

Q

In. the. Marchetti

His choice was not to incriminate him­

I think maybe I didn’t make myself clear.

He is thinking about changing his business from gambli nc

11

to selling dope, so he applies for the blank.

12

for the blank, people who have learned their lesson say, "Man,

13

that is not the business to get into," and he decides not to

14

buy any dope and not to sell any dope.

15

Has he committed any crime?

16

A

Has he been injured?

As a matter of the scheme, he would not be apply­

17

ing for the order form.

13

from him, would be applying for the order form.

19

Q

After he applies

His buyer, or the parson who would buy

They both don’t decide not to go into business.

20

The buyer decides to quit and the seller decides not to sail.

21

He is not incriminated, is he?

22

A

One difficulty with the question is that —

23

Q

My whole point is, just the picking up of the

24

order blank — that is the peirt I have trouble with —■ is

25

in and of itself self-incriminating?

13

that

That is the only point.

1

A

That, in and of itself, is self-incriminatory

2

because he is then obliged to reveal the information concerning

3

a sale.

4

of Your Honor8s question

5

stances, be obliged to give any information, because he made no

6

sale, and I think in that case he would not incriminate himself,

If ha commits no sale — I think that was the thrust
he would not, under those circum­

7

Q

Now the difference between that and this case.

8

A

In this case, he made a sale.

9

Q

Buthe didn't order a blank,

10

A

The blank was not offered to him, nor did he re­

either.

n

quest it, but it is our position that he did not have to request

12

it in the first instance, because had he done so, and had he

13

received it, he wouldnhave- been obliged to fill it out

14

would have incriminated himself.

15

and he

Since that obligation would have been thrust on him

16

had hereceived it,

17

take that risk, as

18

ing for it in the first place.

19

held that Leary did not even have to go to try to register be­

20

cause the Government's position in Leary was that if Leary had

21

gone to try to register so that he could buy marijuana, nobody

22

would have known that he was revealing information because he

23

wouldn't have been permitted to register and nobody would have

24

seen the form.

25

our argument is that he does not have to
this Court has stated in Leary, by even ask­
In the Leary case, this Court

But this Court stated in Leary that Leary didn't even
14

1

have to go through the steps of beginning his registration be­

z

cause that might have subjected him, under the statutory scheme,

3

as it was intended by Congress to function, to the risk of

4

having to supply that information.
I think the Leary case directly covers the question

5

S

that Your Honor has asked here.

He does not have to begin the

7

process, because to begin it would thrust the obligation on him

8

to supply that information.
I might also add that the decisions of this Court

9
10

treat the order form provision as an inherent part of the taxinc

1?

scheme, in addition to the legislative history treating it that

12

way.
Another problem in this case is whether the statute

13
14

was directed to those inherently suspect of criminal activities.

15

This was a question which was raised by the Circuit, in its

IS

opinion.

17

reasoning in the Leary decision, covers that problem in this

18

case, too.

Once again, I believe that the Leary decision , the

The Court held in Leary that those who could register

19

20

to deal, in marijuana would do so because if they didn't do so

21

they would be acting illegally and the penalties were quite

22

severe.

23
24
25

Therefore, this Court was willing to assume that every
.1
.
I
body who could register would register, and that the-only people
who would be faced with the self-incrimination problem would be
the people who could not register and, therefore, you would have
15

t

a distinct class of people involved in criminal activities

2

that the self-incrimination problem would be directed to.
This point is apparently not disputed by the Govern­

3
4

ment because on page 11 in its brief, the Government states that

5

anybody who could register under State law — well, nobody could

S

register under Federal law unless they were permitted to register

7

under State law.

8

who could register would register and falls within the Leary

9

reasoning.

10

Thus, we have the assumption that everybody

Of course, this case deals with heroin.

Since under

11

the statutes relating to narcotics as they are presently con­

12

stituted there is no legal dealing in heroin, therefore the

13

application of this statute to any heroin transaction automatic­

14

ally results in the application of it to a class of individuals

15

that is suspect of criminal activity.

16

The Government, in its brief, indicates that to avoid

17

violation ™ and I think this goes back to Mr. Justice Marshall's

13

question — the defendant need not act.

19

was put to rest by this Court in Marchetti, where the Government

20

argued that the defendant need net gamble once he has registered.

21

The Court said that is not. true where, if he complies with the

22

statute, he would reveal information which would subject him to

23

criminal penalties under sections.

24

applies to this case.

25

Q

1 think that reasoning

I think the same reasoning

That reasoning would apply to this case only if
IS

1

there were a Federal statute that required a seller who sold

2

somebody narcotics without receiving an order form to report

S

that fact.

4

That is the missing link in this case, isn't it?
A

I don't think so, Your Honor, because then con­

5

ceivably if the Government could find out that he made such a

6

sale, which they often do by the use of undercover narcotics

7

agents, they could prosecute him under Section 21 U.S.C., Sec­

a

tion 173-174.

9

Q

What is that one?

10

A

That is the illegal importation — well, conceal­

ii

ment, facilitation and possession of narcotics that have been

12

imported with the knowledge that they have been imported, and

13

possession gives rise to the presumption of knowledge and impor­

14

tation.

15
16

11
18

Of course, the defendant could also have bean prosecui e<
under the State statutes.
Q

We cannot get into that until we have such a

case, can we?

19

A

Mo, but it is in answer to the question.

20

Q

You are speculating on a future possibility

21

22
23

which isn't before us today.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

4

MR, STRAUSS;

Mr. Chief Justice, .and may it please

the Court;

5

I think petitioner's arguments rest on an assumption

6

which is demonstrably false and which, it seems to me, has in­

7

formed the questioning during that time of her argument; that

8

is to say, the assumption that petitioner had an opportunity to

9

provide the Government with incriminating information and then

10

declined to do so in order to protect his Fifth Amendment rights
Such arguments could be entertained only where the

11
12

order forms, for which Section 4705 provides, are actually re­

13

ceived by the sellar of narcotic drugs.

14

Government's proof in this case, proof entirely independent of

15

anything that petitioner said, or any information that he may

16

have provided to the Government, that petitioner received no

17

order form from the purchaser, or Government agent, as a matter

18

of fact.

IS

It is clear from the

It is clear from the statutory scheme, as a matter of

20

law, that neither petitioner, nor anyone willing to purchase

2!

narcotics from him, could lawfully have obtained order forms

22

for that purpose.

23

In these circumstances, it is entirely premature to

24

ask what Fifth Amendment questions might be raised in a case

25

where an order form is actually presented and an obligation tc
18

i

disclose then arises.

2

Q

' Is that the general sanction behind it?

If there

3

is a sale, on the presentation of an order form, then there is

4

an obligation upon the seller to keep one copy of the. form for

S

a period of time and to send another one in.

6

A

7

Q

Is that enforcible through a criminal sanction?

8

A

It is* through the criminal sanction, among

9

Yes* sir.

others* of 26 U,S,C,, Section 7203* which punishes generally

10

any failure to conform to the reporting requirements of Federal

Vi

tax law.

12

It is not punishable under Section 4705(a) and never

13

has been punished under that section.

u

as this Court recognizes* are widely disparate.

15

is the most sevree of Federal narcotics violations. Section 7203

16

states a misdemeanor.

17

Of course* the penalties,
Section 4705(a)

We are dealing with entirely separate typer of things

18

and what I hope to do is to persuade the Court that these two

19

different forms* if you like, putting of a two-step procedure,

20

first receive an order form and second provide some information

21

on that form* each step serves an important function in the

22

course of Federal narcotics regulation.

23
24
25

In these circumstances * as we say, it is entirely
premature to ask what Fifth Amendment questions might be raised
if an order form is actually presented.
19

The requirement that

i

in the first instance an order form be received is independent,

2

and neither that requirement, nor petitioner's prosecution for

3

its violation, raises any question of self-incrimination.

4

That, in brief, is the Government's case.

The Fifth

5

Amendment provides, and 1 quote, that !iNo person shall be com-

6

palled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."
Until petitioner receives an order form, he is under-

7

8

no pressure whatever to give any information of any kind to the

9

Government.

10

The only pressure is the statutory command enforced

by criminal prosecution in this case that he not sell.
Thus, the Government has not, as petitioner has sug­

11

12

gested it

had, abandoned its contention that the obligation to

13

receive an order form is distinct from the obligation to report

14

and retain certain types of information and, for that matter,

15

to refrain from fraudulent use of order forms, obligations which

IS

are imposed by other parhr of Section 4705 and by Federal income

17

tax law generally.
Of course obligations don't stop with receipt of the

18
19

form.

Once an individual in a narcotics sale has received the

20

form, then the further obligation does arise to report.

21

a different case.

That is

That is the case that isn't here.

22

Q

What exactly is the form he receives?

23

A

The form is the form set out in the appendix to

24

petitioner's brief as Appendix C, which provides for a statement

25

by the purchaser as to what kind of drugs he wants, and how much
20

V

It has a place for the purchaser's name and his signature.

2

is to be addressed to a particular seller.

3

4

I may say, simply to fill in some questions that were

It

It has a place for

5

raised during petitioner's statement, two factors concerning the

6

form.
The form is not issued in blank.

7

By statute, Section

8

4705(f), before the Secretary may issue the form he must cause

9

to be stamped on it the narae of the purchaser, and again by

10

statute, Section 4705(g), it is a felony —

n

Q

He sends that form to someone.

12

A

To the purchaser, Your Honor.

13

Q

Which requires him to tell whether he has pur­

14

chased something.
A

15

Is that what, you are saying?

No, Your Honor.

Someone wishing to purchase

16

narcotics, someone who must be a lawful registrant by statute,

17

applies to the Secretary of the Treasury to get a book of these

18

forms.

19

Treasury issues the forms, before issuing them he stamps the

the purchaser wishes to make a purchase of narcotics, he fills

I understand.

It is sent to the seller, and if, the seller’s name is

not filled in, then the seller must, among other things, pro­

13

14

drugs have bean sold.
.

15

Q

And the quantity?

16

A

And the quantity, the confirming information?

17
18
19

that is right? that drugs have been sold in a quantity.
Q

I take it there are some buyers who can really

get order forms and present them to the seller.

20

A

That is right? 400,000 of them.

21

Q

And there are some situations in which the seller!

22

could, legally, without incriminating himself, fill out the

23

form and file it.

24
25

A

Approximately 200,000 executed triplicates are

received by the Secretary of the Treasury each month.
22

In the

1

fiscal year 1967, only four persons entitled to use order forms

2

were convicted of narcotics offenses.,

3

Q

So there are people who can get order forms.

4

A

The very overwhelming majority of transactions

3

where order forms are used are legal, and that, indeed, is our

6

point.

A

You are correct so far as heroin is concerned.

But this is part of a larger statutory scheme.

Q

This is a heroin case.

And this statute does not distinguish as to heroin,

5

Q

But it requires him to make the report with refer

A

No* Your Honor* it does not* because under the

statute* it is impossible to secure an order form for the pur­

A

It includes heroin? that is right,

Q

Even thoughf in fact, if an order form had been

3

used, in keeping with everything else, the subject being heroin,

9

ha might have been prosecuted under what?
A

to

The purchaser could have been prosecuted under

it

Section 4705 (g) for fraudulent use of an order form.

The seller;

12

could certainly be prosecuted under the various statutes that

13

make possession of heroin an offense, Section 174, Title 21,

14

Section 4704 of Title 26, and quite clearly there would be no

15

tax stamps on that package of heroin which had been sold.

1®

But there could be no prosecution under Section 4705(c).

17

I do think it is important to indicate what the

t&

22
23

separate function of this requirement that you receive an order
form is.

j
Q

Is it the Government’s practice to prosecute

these heroin sales where no order form is used under 4705(a)?
A

Since 1956, when the penalty provisions of the

Harrison Narcotics Act were amended, to differentiate among the

24

various offenses, and the penalty for violation of Section

25

4705(a) was made more severe than the others, the practice has
25

f

2

has been to use Section 4705(a) for all illegal trafficking,
/
peddling, of all narcotic drugs, including heroin.

3

Q

You already told us that even if they had used

4

the order form, nevertheless, both purchaser and seller could

5

have been prosecuted for other offenses.

6

A

For other offenses.

No.

Tha seller could only be prosecuted for

failure to file the requisite forms under 7203 of the Internal

6

tions that this statute serves, and I do have to talk about the

7

Harrison Act generally in this situation.

i

8
9

We have on the one side the channel of legitimate
trade in narcotic drugs.

Narcotic drugs, while they are very

10

dangerous to individuals, addictive, still have important medi­

11

cal uses and hundreds of thousands of pounds of opium are im­

12

ported into this country legally every year for manufacture into

13

various drug3, not including heroin, find used in medical trade.
Those legally imported drugs are-supervised from the

14
15

moment of entry into the United States to tha moment of their

16

consumption by use of the reports made on triplicates by the

17

hundreds of thousands of legal users of narcotic drugs every

18

month.

19

aspect of the order form requirement.

20

That is the function, if you like, of the reporting

The function of the receipt aspect of the order form

21

requirement which we are talking about here is quite different.

22

By requiring that you receive an order form, the Government is,

23

in effect, there shall be no sales but legal sales.

24

obtain an order form lawfully to usa in a narcotics transaction

25

You can onl

and you can only use the order form lawfully if the sale is a
21

1

legal one under Federal law.

a

That being the case,, the absence of an order form,

3

the failure to receive an order form, if the Government can

4

prove it in any narcotics case, is immediate proof that the

5

sale was an illegal one, and it is that separate function which

6

petitioner seeks to affiliate with the question of information

7

gathering, and thus draw a conjurer's circle around himself,

8

if I may repeat that phrase that Justice Holmes used so long

9

ago.

10

I think that it should then be quite clear that this

11

case is not in the line of cases which began in this Court

12

with Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board.

13

cases held, in effect, that the Fifth Amendment forbids statutes

14

whose usual impact is to make a seprate crime out of an indivi­

15

dual's failure to report his criminal acts to the Government.

18

Those

Here the violation of the statute consists not in

17

failure to report, but in the positive act of selling narcotics

18

to a person who has not proved his eligibility as a legal pur­

19

chaser by presentation of an official order form for the

20

narcotics bought.

21

The question of reporting, as I have just raid, never

22

arises in that context because order forms cannot be obtained.

23

It is only after an order form has been presented, in circum­

24

stances not present here, and in which the overwhelming majority

25

of transactions are entirely legal, that any such question arises.
28

1

I may say, Justice Stewart, in response to the remarks

2

that you made before about this being heroin, and to that ex­

is no particular distinction made as to what drug is reported

law.

That is correct.

19

Q

That would be a violation of what?

20

A

Section 4705(g),

2!
22

which is not at issue in this

case.
I think some notion of the distance between this

23

statute and the statutes that were involved in Albertson,

24

Marchetti, Grosso, Haynes and Leary can be obtained by a closer

25

view of the classes subject to the provisions involved in those
32

1

cases.

2

In Albertson, the statuta involved made it an offense

3

fcr administratively identified members of the Communist Party

4

not to register as such.

S

Marchetti and Grosso involved the obligation of per-

6

sons to identify themselves as professional gamblers, outlawed

7

in 49 States.

10

__

As this Court interpreted the statute at issue in

8
9

-

Haynes, that case required registration in circumstances which
would almost always establish prior criminal conduct.
In Leary and Covington last term, the petitioners

11
12

were obliged, by payment of an extraordinary tax, $100 per

13

ounce, to identify themselves as members of an entirely crimina)

14

class.
In each of these cases, it was not only the petitiones,

15
16

but all or virtually all the persons subject to the requirement

17

in issue who had engaged in criminal conduct, and thus ran the

18

risk of incriminating themselves if they did what the Government

19

commanded.

20
21

22

Q

I understood yon to say that the order from the

Secretary is irrelevant.
A

For the purpose of prosecuting this case, and

23

fcr the purpose of Section 4705(a) cases generally, the only

24

thing which is relevant about the order form is whether it is

25

received or not.

Any information it may have on it, any
33

%

information that may later be put on it, is irrelevant.

2

Q

The indictment charges that defendant, unlawfully,

3

willfully and knowingly did sell, barter, exchange and give away

4

to Guzman approximately 19,500 grams of heroin hydrochloride,

5

a narcotic drug, in that the said sale, barter, exchange and

6

giving away was not in pursuance of a written order of the said

7

Francisco K. Guzman on a form issued in blank for that purpose

8

by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States ox* his

9

delegate.

10

What does that mean?

I think that is entirely consistent with what

occurred„ if someone attempted to do that, he would be guilty

13

one sells a narcotic drug, including heroin, without receiving

any order form cit all, he is guilty of a felony under another

section of the statute, Section 4705(a), and that case is what

based on that particular Congressional finding, the drug is

treated as all other drugs under the scheme.

But aside from those particular restrictions

Section 4721 and 22 impose the obligation to register.

7

In the particular circumstances we are talking about, probably

8

the relevant obligation is to register as a wholesaler or as

S

a retailer of narcotic drugs.

Those sections make quite clear

10

that the only persons who may register are persons lawfully

11

entitled to sell narcotic drugs; that is, persons who would

12

violate no lav/ of the state if they sold narcotic drugs.
Generally, once a person lias registered and only in

that circumstance as provided in Section 4705(f), he may apply

15

to the Secretary of tne Treasure to obtain blank order forms,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PIIYLIS SKLOOT BAMBERGER, ESQ.

7

MRS. BAMBERGER:

Q

I will £iddress myself briefly to three questions which

9
10

Thank you, Your Honor.

were raised in the argument.
First, Mr. Justice Stewart spoke of a missing link.

11

I would suggest that in this case, while the statute is not

12

identical to those of the prior cases in this area, the differ­

13

ence is not material and should not be dispositive because Leary

U

assumes that the statute will function as it was intended to do

15

by Congress.

16

To do that, or to interpret the statute in any other

17

way, or to apply it in any other way undermines the rules that

10

were established with respect to the Fifth Amendment in the

19

series of cases prior to this,,

20

these rights.

21

22

So, we come to determine how that missing link effects

,

It is our position that the Fifth Amendment, right

is the same here as it has been in prior cases.

Although, the

23

very words of the section which provide criminal penalty do not

24

include the provisions requiring the information.

25

the statute requires the incriminatory information and under the

39

The rest of

i

2

Thus, if the defendant receives the order form as has

3

been stated by the Government, he must give the information»

4

Ilis position then is no different if he does not ask for it with

5

the knowledge that if he receives it he will have to supply the

6

incriminating information.

7

has said previously, at the initial stages of the proceeding

8

rather than waiting until other statutes come into play in a

9

different factual context.

10

lie merely can stop, as this Court

The Government has indicated,in its argument that

This

We are not concerned here with the

17

The effect of Section 47Q5 is to give the transaction

18

an appearance of legality since it says that a sale can be made

19

with an order form while the sale may be illegal under other

sections.

21

into 4705(a), the transaction appears to be legal and complying

22

with it appears to make it justifiable and legal.

time, complying with it reveals the violations of the other

statutes which would be violated by heroin transaction.

25

That is precisely the problem raised.

By falling

you think that that kind of a statute poses these problems?
A

Ho, I don't, Your Honor, because that statute

does not give his act an appearance of legality by indicating
that he has violated some other statute.
