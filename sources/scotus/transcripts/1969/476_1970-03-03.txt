ORAL ARGUMENT BY GERARD C. SMETANA, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. SMETANA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it please

the Courts

status of charging parties under Section 10(1) of the Act.
Specifically, whether they have standing to appeal,

50
it

What is involved here is a determination of the

denial of temporary injunctive relief.
Section .1.0(1) of the Act is an extraordinary remedy.

12
1.3

It provides, whenever it's charge that any person has engaged

14

in an unfair labor practice, within the meaning of Section

15

8(b)(4) A,B, and C; and specifically here, the charging party

16

is a neutral employer in a charge involving violations of

17

Section 8(b)(4) B, the secondary boycott provisions of the

18

Act.

19

So, the charging party is one of the persons contem­

20

plated for protection under Section 10(1).

21

goes on to say: "The preliminary investigation of such charge

22

shall be made forthwith and be given priority over all cases."

23

In this particular case, Sears, Roebuck, the

24

25

The statute then

Petitioner, filed a charge with the NLRB and the NLRB pro­
ceeded to make such investigation.
3

The statute then goes on

1

to say; "If, after such investigation the officer or regional

2

attorney to whom the matter may be referred, has reasonable

3

cause to believe such charge is true, and thata complaint

4

should issue, he shall, on behalf of the Board, petition a

5

District Court for injunctive relief.,”

6

In this particular case, the Regional Directos: for

7

the NLRB in Denver, made such a finding of reasonable cause.

8

Mid he followed the statutory mandate and sought injunctive

9

relief in the District Court for the District of Colorado.

10

It is our position that the charging party, or a

11

neutral party, such as Sears is in this case, is the very

12

person whom Congress, when it enacted the — not only the

13

8(b)(4) provisions, the secondary boycott provisions at the

14

time of Taft-Hartley, but also Section 10(1) the mandatory

15

requirement that the Government seek injunctive relief is

16

the party for whose benefit, in addition, of course, to the

17

public benefit, for whose benefit the relief is being sought.

18

Specifically, the issue in this case arises --

19

Q

20

21

Did the statute say what theposition of those

charging parties would be in those proceedings?
A

Mr. Justice, the statute says only this, with

22.

respect to fie role of the charging party; "Upon filing of any

23

such petition, the courts shall cause notice thereof to be

24

served upon any person involved in the charge, and such

25

person, including the charging party, shall be given an

13

Q

14

A

But —
It is our contention that we will demonstrate

15

to this Court as we believe we have in our briefs, that in

16

reading and looking to the entire scheme of the Act — in

17

other words, the role that the charging parties play in the

18

board proceedings, because the same charge that Sears, Roebuck

19

here filed, gave

20

two concurrent actions? in fact, it happens in this case, they

21

were on the same day, although they needn’t have been.

rise to two proceedings.

It gave rise to

22

In this particular case the Regional Director issued

23

an unfair labor practice complaint, alleging that the carpet-

24

layer’s Respondent union here was violating or he had reason­

25

able cause to believe that the Respondent union was violating

5

1

the secondary boycott provisions of the Act, and similarly,

2

filed a petition for injunctive relief.

3

still verymuch alive.

4

Those two cases are

And the Regional Director, at all times, critical to

5

our petition here, has continued to maintain that reasonable

6

belief or reasonable cause to believe that the union had

7

violated the law or was in the process of violating the law.
Q
v\

10

You said that both cases are very ranch alive is

one of the questions at issue betweenyou and your brother?
isn’t it?

11

A

Correct.

?£

Q

Thera is a controverted questionof mootness in

13
14

this case that arguing? is there not?
A

There is a question, if this Court would wish

15

to hoar argument on that question I certainly would, toward

16

the end of my argument, be happy to present our contentions

17

on mootness.

18

Q

I think your friend is going to mention this.

19

A

I am sure he is.

20

Well, essentially, on the mootness question, very

21

briefly, there are — the major position that we will take

22

with respect to mootness is that as a matter of policy

23

orders involved here are short-term orders.

24

injunctive relief under Section 10(1) of the Act is the kind

25

of relief that not only expires because the dispute is

6

the

Specifically,

1

resolvedc and so that if there is some problem with respect to

2

the correctness of the standing of parties in that proceeding

3

this Court would never have an opportunity to resolve that

4

question if it were to wait — if it could not do so at that

5

time o

6

And so, under the doctrine of the Southern Pacific

7

Terminal case* and more recently, as this Court said last year

S

in the Moore versus Ogiivie , these are important public

9

questions that will come up again and that are not rendered

10

moot, because of the continuing effect, not only upon Sears

11

in this case and other cases, but other parties similarly

12

situated, and would escape review, but for the Mootness Doc­

13

trine ? therefore the Mootness Doctrine will be set aside»
We also contend that the case is not factually moot.

14

15

Vie say it is not factually moot because, for a number of

16

reasons»

17

Wagshal, the union here, to the extent that it has stopped

18

picketing, whatever we can infer from that, we can only infer j

19

that it did stop picketing pursuant to an order of the Board,

20

and more specifically, the union maintains the correctness of

21

its position and has so argued the correctness of its position

22

January 22nd this year in the Court of Appeals for the District

23

of Columbia Circuit, maintaining that it believes and con­

24

tinues to believe that the picketing of Sears, Roebuck was

25

not violative of Section 8(b)(4)»

Specifically, that as in the Bakery Drivers versus

7

So, that so long as this controversy and the under­

1
2

lying dispute remains, there is still the possibility that

3

the picketing will resume and that possibility would come

4

about, should the District of Columbia Circuit, where the —

5

and what happened here in the underlying case is that the

6

trial examiner and the board found the union to have violated

The union moved the District o

Columbia

Circuit toreview that decision and the Sears, Roebuck inter­
vened and the board cross-petitioned for enforcement of that
decision.
And inthe event the District of Columbia Circuit
remands to the Board, there are a number of possibilities as
to what can arise in that case»

Should thex-e be a remand, it

is our contention that there is also then, a possibility of
a renewal of picketing, because there may be some question as
to something further the Board might have to do»
In any event, so far as the factual mootness, it is
our further contention that the language of the statute, so far
as the time during which the injunctive provision runs.
other words, in Section 10(1)»

In

Section 10(1) states that the

injunction — that the court shall grant such injunctive

21

22

Section 8(b)(4)»

relief, pending final adjudication of the Board»
,

23
24
25

So, there was another question, although it was
perhaps not necessary

for the Court to: resolve that question,,

if it resolves the question of mootness on the Southern
8

i

Pacific Terminal and Moore versus Ogilvie line of cases, that.

2

it is perhaps not necessary to reach the question of inter­

3

pretation of those words, pending final adjudication of the

4

Board.
It is our position that pending final adjudication

5

of the Board, means when the matter has finally been resolved

6
t

by the Board, and a settlement would be a final resolution.,

8

In this case we contend it has not been finally resolved by

9

the Board, because of the possibility of the remand.,

e>v

Because, in that situation, the Board would have to

10
n

do something further and we recognize the fact that there

12

was a final Board order here from which the union appeals the

13

statutory language is not clear, and we would contend that

14

that is the meaning of the words "final adjudication."
We have no authority "other than logic and reasoning

15

to support that position.

13

Our argument — before 1 pass on to the argument, 2

17

should, briefly, summarize any facts that I have, in my opening

18

remarks, not alluded to.

19

In this particular case the picketing of Sears,

20

Roebuck continued for a period of ten months.

21

The argument,

Your Honors, essentially falls into two or three categories.

22

Our major contention is that the scheme of the Act, as this

23

Court has considered the scheme of the Act in the Scofield

24

-

decisions, renders that charging parties should have the right

23

9
ii

i

1

to appeal.

9

The reason for it, specifically — what we would

t«

3

se under the scheme of the Act, is that charging parties

4

possess the very rights that axe set forth in Section 10(IK

5

They possess those identical rights and are treated as parties

6

in the Board proceedings, and therefore, they should similarly

7

be treated as parties in a Section 10(1) proceedings
We will then also allude to the guidance that the

8
9
10

legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act can give with
respect to the question of charging party rights.
When we say that we are a party, we use the word

11

12

"party,"with three specific exceptions, so there is no mis­

13

take,

14

one is outside? this is the framework of the National Labor

We say: first that we do not seek injunctive relief

Just to recap for one moment with res­

When the District Court for the District of Colorado
denied the injunctive relief which the Regional Director had
sought» it wasin that proceeding that the charging party»
Sears» the Responding Union and Board all appeared by counsel
and all participated» as provided in the Act.
The District Court Justice, Judge, held that there
was little probability that the Board would find a violation
of law and therefore denied the injunctive relief.

After

this decision the Regional Director continued in his belief
that there was, in fact, reasonable cause to believe that a
violation existed.
We had, we attempted to convince the Regional
Director to seek and to appeal from the decision of the
District. Court,

That request and those requests were without

avail and as the time for filing an appeal drew near, faced
23
with the continued picketing of Sears at its Denver locations,
24
faced with the Director's continuing belief that there was a
25

11

1

violation and with the Director’s refusal to file an appeal,

2

we, on behalf of the charging party, filed an appeal.

3

There ware then motions to dismiss that appeal for

4

lack of standing by — both by the Board and by the union.

£i

There was one further intervening factor which, perhaps, has

6

some significance to some of the arguments that have been

7

raised by the counsel for the Regional Director,

8

9

After the appeal had been filed, the trial examiner
who heard the facts of the underlying case in the first in­

10

stance, came down with a favorable decision for Sears.

11

found that there was reasonable cause to believe the secondary

12

boycott, by a section of the Act had been violated.

He

It was within a few days of that decision that we,

13
14

again, wrote to the General Counsel and requested two things:

15

requested first that perhaps the general counsel, since the

16

picketing was still continuing, would seek injunctive relief

17

under the Discretionary Section, Section 10 (j) of the Act, and

IS

admittedly, we were aware of no case which permitted, where

19

the Board had gone for injunctive relief under Section 10(j),

20

even though this was an area that was covered by 10{1), but

21

the language of the Act would lead one to believe thafcit was

22

possible.

23
24
25

We asked secondly of the Board once more, that they
join us in the appeal.

The Board responded in a few days,

indicating that they did not choose to file for 10(j) relief,

12
1

1

even if that was available* and furthermore * they did not seek

f..

to join us in the appeal»

K.I

the time for them to join us in the appeal had disappeared»

4

The only reason they gave was that

I think that exchange of letters only has become

5

significant and we have mentioned it in our reply brief* in

6

view of the Board's, one of the Board's contentions here*,

7

the same contention they had made below* that if the charging

8

party were to be given the right of appeal and were to be

9

given party rights* subject to the limitation which 1 started

10

to outline before the luncheon break* that would amount to

11

the Board losing control and the Board speaks of control in a

12

number of instances»

13

There is one kind of control which the Board speaks

14

of in the case before the District Court* and there is another

15

kind of control the Board addresses itself to with respect, to

16

the decision of whether or not it should appeal.

17

Nox-7* with respect to the first kind of control* I

18

have started to say that we contend that we have rights of a

19

party, subject to three limitations.

20

not seek the injunctive relief? we simply support that which

21

the Board has done* and we take this position that once the

22

Regional Director has filed a petition for injunctive relief*

23

by virtue of the language in the statute, giving us the right

24

to be heard? we havetha right to support that position.

25

The first is that we do

We relied in the 10th Circuit upon the Retail

13

!

Clerks0 casis, and we would contend that the reasoning of that

2

Court with respect to this question, is indeed sound.

3

We

the second limitation that we would state, would afford to

4

a charging party is the fact that the charging party at no

5

time may enlarge or urge an enlargement of the position taken

6

by the Director and the petition that he filed with the

7

District Court.

8

9

And it is for that reason that we would distinguish
the decision that Justice Marshall, then Judge Marshall?

10

rendered in the Second Circuit in the McLeod case» because

n

in that case the Board and the Union had cited the McLeod

12

case as proposition for the fact that charging parties should

13

not be granted this right, because it’s violative of Norris-

14

LaGuardia.

15

And, in the McLeod case, as in that whole line of

10

cases, it is clear that where the charging partyenlarges upon

17

something which the Director is seeking — in the McLeod case

18

the charging party was urging that there was handbilling in

19

that case and the charging party was urging that they would

2(5

submit representation with respect to the handbilling.

21

And the Court concluded that the question of mis­

22.

representation was not one of the bases upon which the Board

23

had decided to petition.

24

the charging party was urging a different result, to that

23

extent there could be a violation of Norris-LaGuardia.

And, therefore, to the extent that

14

1

Finally, with respect — and the Tenth Circuit in

2

this case dismissed or granted the Board and Union5s motions

3

dismissed for lack of standing on essentially three grounds.

4

First, that the relief here would constitute a

5

violation of Norris-LaGuardia and they contend -that the

6

reason for that is, in effect, they will be granting an injunc

7

tive relief to a charging party.

8

Secondly, the cases we cite, we cited to them and

9

cited in our brief,, the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerks' case,

10

the Tenth Circuit took the position that that ease really only

n

referred to the rights of charging parties in the District

12

Court and therefore, it was not apposite or helpful to them

13

in determining whether or not we would have standing to

14

appeal and have any rights in the Courts of Appeal.

15

And, finally, the Tenth Circuit took the position

16

that the statutory7 language, "that the charging parties shall

17

be represented by counsel and present relevant testimony,"

18

means that and no more.

19

Now, with respect to the last, perhaps, first.

20

Whether the language means that and no more, we would then

21

turn to the first part of our argument and we would say that

22

the scheme of the Act, the fact that the charging parties, the

23

same party to -- who was before the District Court in a 10(1)

24

proceeding, also proceeds in the case before the Board? and

25

in that Board case it is true that the charging party is
15

1

referred to as a party.

2

But the scheme of the Act, as this Court had held in

O
«J

Scofield, the Court looks to the overall concern and the over­

4

all concern in this Act is the protection of charging party

5

rights, and particularly here, there was even a stronger

6

protection with respect to a neutral in an 8(b)(4) situation,

7

where there is the mandatory requirement to seek relief.

8

But in the Board proceeding, the charging party par­

9

ticipates at all levels sin the investigation, in the issuance

10

of complaint and settlement, hearings, appeals, and so on,

A

Ho,

1 would say the statute is not clear and

4

one of the Board's principal arguments is that very fact, that

3

the statute is silent.

6

We would answer that in three ways : first, that the

7

scheme of the Act, in other words, since the charging parties

8

have these rights in the Board case, they also have these

9

rights in the District Court case, and then we have cited this

10

Court to the only cases we have been able to find on trying

11

to define an appeal? Justice Marshall’s decision in Marbury

versus Madison, and we would contend that an appeal, by its

there would be a prior determination, but that prior deter­

Floor of the Senate.

21

Senator Taft, at that point said that he could not

go forward; he would offer another compromise, and that if the

A

Well, my recollection was that it was the uni©

who appealed in that case and that we went in there to defend
our oto position.

And whatever may be said of that case, Your

Honor, I do want to call attention to the latest decision of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which they say—
30

1

in which they said that "although the quetsion of the charging

2

party standing to an appeal was broached in the Retail Clerks

3

case, they nevertheless have now concluded that the charging

4

party does not have the status of a party, of a full party

5

with the right of appeal and they have lined up with the Tenth

6

Circuit in this particular case.

7
8
9

How, if I may get back now for a moment to develop
my argument with respect to the contentions of the petitioner.
The Petitioner’s ease that a charging party in a 10(1}

!0

proceedings is entitled to appeal from an adverse decision of

11

the District Court, independently of the Regional Director, it

12

seems to me, rests

13

charging party with certain qualficiations that the Petitioner

14

here had indicated, has the status of a full party in those

15
16

essentially upon the predicate that a

proceedings»
Noxf, it seems to us that that predicate, that predi­

17

cate misconceives the statutory scheme and also fails to

18

accord proper worth to the legislative history that gave birth

19

to Section 10(1).

20

In our view under the statute a charging party plays

21

a subordinate role in a 10(1) proceeding in the District Court.

22

Congress vested upon the charging party the limited role of

23

assisting and aiding in the course of the prosecution of the

24
25

case by the Regional Director, but that it is the Regional
Director who retains control, not only over the initiation
31

1

in the proceedings in the District Court * but also he retains

2

control of the litigation at all states, both the trial stage

3

as well as the appellate stage.

4

Now, Section 10(1) represents one of the many com­

5

promises that are to be found in this statute and as in the

6

case of other Labor Act compromises which have engaged the

7

attention of this Court, the meaning of Section 10(1) and the

8

role which a charging party was to play in the proceedings can

9

only be fully determined by going back to the legislative
history»

10

I think it is now wholly amiss to say that in a case

11

like this a page of legislative history does outweigh the book

12

of logic.

13

Section 10(1) became a part of the Act, as Mr.

Smetana has indicated, in 1947 when Congress adopted the Taft-

14

Hartley Amendments, including the restrictions against

15

secondary boycotts and strikes over jurisdictional disputes.

16

In the course of that debate Congress took note of the

17

fact that the administrative unfair labor practice proceedings

18

before the Board were unduly and unavoidedly time-consuming.

fg

And for that reason it was felt that a speedier remedy was

20

required in the public interest, rather than a Board order or

a court decision enforcing the Board order.

only, would take control of the case away from the Board?

Yes, Your Honor? I think it would, because at

that point the Regional Director who

has initiated the case,

10

may conclude, for various reasons and I will come to those

15

later, may conclude that there is really no longer appropriate

52

to continue to press at the appellate stage for an injunction

13

on the basis of the king! of record that was made in the court

14

below, on the basis of what kind of issues were involved there.

15

18

appeal from an adverse decision of the District Court,

19

How, if you permit the charging party to say, "Well,

20

we will independently take an appeal, despite the failure of

21

the Regional Director to fake an appeal, in effect, what you

22

have done, you have transformed what is a Government litigation

23

into a private lawsuit and indeed, the petitioner in its brief,

24

almost virtually concedes at that point that it becomes a

25

private lawsuit.
35

1

Now, to be sure, the Petitioner is arguing that it

2

is confined to the theory of the case originally advanced by

3

the Regional Director, that it's confined also to the kind of

4

relief that the Regional Director is asking, but I suggest,

5

Your Honor, that once the Regional Director is out of the

6

picture and the charging party is permitted to go ahead and

7

take an appeal, that then it really has become a private piece

8

of litigation rather than government litigation, and the

9

Congress did not intend to permit that-

10

Q

How far does your argument go, Mr. Manoli?

Now,

II

what Congress did provide in 10(1) was that if the Regional

12

Director thought there was reasonable cause to believe that

13

the unfair labor charge was correct, it had an absolute duty

14

to — first of all, it had a duty to give priority to this

15

kind of a charge.

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

And, having given priority, and finding a reason­

18

able cause to believe in the truth of the charge, he had an

19

absolute duty to go into a Federal District Cou fc and file a

20

petition for an injunction.

21

your argument, that ten minutes later it could say, "Well, we

22

want now to dismiss the injunction."

23

with the obvious will of Congress; would it?

24

25

A

And you would say, I suppose, in

That would hardly comport

Well, Your Honor, let me take one case.

Let's

assume that when the charges are filed, the investigation
36

1
r*.

£,

has been made, the Regional Director shows that there is
reasonable cause to believe that the charges have merit, and
that a complaint should issue; yes.

He is mandated by the

4

statute here to go into the District Court to seek an injunc­

c

tion.

€

Now, on the basis of the development in the District

7

Court, he may conclude that there is no longer any merit to the

8

unfair labor practice charges, and that there is no longer any

9

basis for injunctive relief.

10

In other words, with that kind of a record having

11

been made in the District Court, he may, as I say, conclude

12

that he's got no case at all any more and Congress did not

12

require him to stick with a case willy nilly, nor does Congress

14

require him to take an appeal from an adverse decision of a —

15
16
17

Q

You say that.all that Congress required was that

he file a petition, and that ten minutes later he could say,
"1 now want to dismiss it

with prejudice?”

18

A

Yes, that's -- if he concludes --

19

Q

Do you think that comports with what, the

20
21

Congress said in 10(1)?
A

Your Honors, I think it does.

Let's say that he

22

filed a petition now and ten minutes after he's filed the

2S

petition a piece of evidence which was critical to his case,

24

it suddenly is exposed; it isn't there any more and the piece

2£i

of evidence was critical to his case.
37

He is free to withdraw.

1

He is free fco withdraw because he?s got not case any more on

2

the merits.

3

cause to.issue a comlaint to go to the Board and, having no

4

reasonable cause to issue a complaint, or least he could

5

withdraw the complaint if that were tohappen.

6

no basis any more for an injunctive relief by the District

7

Court.
Q

8

He won11 issue a complaint? there is no reasonable

Then there is

Well, there couldnst have been much of a pre­

liminary investigation„

9

A

10

It's a rare case, Your Honor, where that will

11

happen? it9s a rare case, indeed, where that will happen, but

12

I am addressing myself to the question of could he withdraw it

13

ten minutes later.

14

Q

It’s a hypothetical answer.

15

G

The ten-minute rule might sound more realistic

if it was a month rule.

16
17
18
19

20

A

Yes.

Q

Have you finished up your legislative history?

I interrupted what you started to say.
A

I think I can safely say I know of no case where

ten minutes after we file a petition for an injunction we

21
22

withdrew it.

,

23
24.
25

Well, if I may go on a little bit more with this
legislative history.

I think it53 important, this legislative

history, and 1 can only touch the highlights of it to indicate
38

1.

what the scope of the debate and the intensiveness of the de­

2

bate as to who was to be in charge of this particular litiga­

C'

tion .

4

And Senator Donnell, on the Floor, as I have already

E

read from the supplemental views of Senators Taft and Ball.

6

Senator Donnell, on the Floor of the Senate, said he saw no

7

reason under heaven why the decision toseek injunctive relief

8

and control of the litigation should be exclusively vested in

9

a Board representative, rather than the injured party.
And Senator Wherry added; "The party" — I want to

10

11

quote this — "should not have to depend upon the judgment of

12,

soma bureaucrat in whom is lodged the power to determine when

13

such a course should be followed."
And again, they strongly urged to Senator Donnell

14
15

that the injured party should have, and I want to quote this

16

once more: "should have the right to control its own litiga­

17

tion, to hire its own lawyer, to take such steps as it deems

18

proper and to go into such court as it deems proper to proceed

19

in."

20

Mow, to achieve this purpose, Senator Ball introduced

21

his amendment, and under his amendment, he introduced the

22

amendment on the Floor of the-Senate — under his amendment

23

the -- a party who was suffering from a secondary boycott, or

24

jurisdictional dispute rights, would have the right to'

2E

independently go into the District Court and obtain injunctive
39

1

relief.

2

That proposal encountered strong opposition,
Sorae members of the opposition were unwilling to

permit injunctions, whether at the request of private parties
4

or at the request of the government.

S

suddenly, and might say, vehemently opposed to any provision

6

that would permit a private party to go and seek an injunctive

7

relief in this type of case because they feared a revival,

8

a resurrection of some of the evils that had led to Norris-

9

La,Guardi a»

But the opposition was

They were willing to relax the restrictions of Norris-

10
11

LaCuardia only if the exclusive authority to initiate and to

12

control the litigation of a 10(1) proceeding was vested in the

13

Board,
Nov;, the difference between the two groups was taken

14

15

care of, was resolved through a compromise that Senator Taft

16

proposed.

17

have given a private party the right to go independently into

18

a District Court and get an injunction; as a substitute for

19

that. Senator Taft proposed what is now Section 303 of the Act,

20

,

21

to go into a court in order to get damages.

22

ment was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of something like

23

62 to 28, and Section 10(1), of course, was retained in its

24

present form.

25

As a substitute for the Ball amendment, which would

And Section 303 of the Act. permits an injured party
The Ball amend­

And Senator Taft, after the Conference Committee had
40

1

approved Section 10 CD and Section 303 provisions of the statute

2

to explain that compromise; Senator Taft said that under his

3

proposal the compromise which had been accepted; the injured

4.

party was given "simply a right of suit for damages/’ caused

5

by secondary boycotts or jurisdictional dispute, but that in

6

such cases, and again I want to quote: "The injunction can be

7

obtained only through the National Labor Relations Board»

8
9

Now, I think what emerges from this legislative history
is that Congress agreed to a narrow exception to the Norris-

10

LaGuardia, which vested exclusive jurisdiction in the Board or

11

the Regional Director Cl use the terms interchangably) which

12

vested exclusive control in the Board, not only the initiation,

13

but the control of the litigation at all stages.

14

The private party, the injured party was given simply

15

the right to sue for damages and in Section 10(1) Congress has

16

assigned a subordinate role to the charging party of merely

17

aiding and assisting in the conduct of the 10(1) proceedings

IS

by the Regional Director, but it was the Regional Director who

19

remained in control.
As 1 said earlier, the fight between the proponents

2

of the BAll Amendment and those who opposed it, was not simply

21

22

a fight over who was going to have control over the initiation

23

of the proceeding; the fight went much deeper.

24

who would be in control of that kind of litigation, the injured

25

or the Board?

.

The fight was:

And Congress answered that question firmly in
41

1

favor of the Board and I believe that it's action indicates

2

that Congress withheld from the charging party the status of a

Cj

party»
Q

4

Well, Mr. Manoli, you keep emphasising control

5

of the litigation, as though litigation were just one indivi­

6

sible component»

7

the first instance, or intervention was denied? is that not so?

9

A

Yes, that may well be, Your Honor, but. ~

10

Q

So that control of the litigation concept doesn’t

answer all the questions, quite? does it?
A

12

13
14

15
16
17
18

19
20
21
22
23

Well, it answers them when you take into account

what it was that the — what I'll call the proponents of
Section 10(1) sought to accomplish when they adopted Section
10(f) and opposed the Bali amendment.

They were fearful to

give the charging party any kind of an independent right to
press forward toseek an injunction or to press for an injunc­
tion.

And as I said earlier, if the Regional Director concludes

afterthe has carried out the mandated duty of going into a
District Court, that in the face of that adverse decision, and
because of other considerations I'll spell out in a moment, to
conclude that it’s no longer appropriate to seek injunctive, or
to press for injunctive relief, then the charging party has
taken charge of that litigation and it seems to me that that
kind of control that Congress was talking about would have
42

1

excluded, would exclude the charging party from going on up­

2

stairs and seeking to press' for injunctive relief,

«j,

Q

Was this language of 10(1) that you say gives

4

the charging party a subordinate position, was that part of the

5

so-called Taft compromise?

-Q

8

A

9

That was already, Your Honor —
Was already in the bill?
In the Senate Bill,

It was in the Bill reported

by the Senate Committee; yes, that was already in there.

As a

10!

matter of fact, I might add that the House had passed a bill

II

which permitted both the government or the private party to

12.

seek injunctive relief, but that fell by the wayside, because

13

eventually the Conference Committee, agreed with the SEnats that

14-

Section 10(1) would be adopted.
Q

15

Well, the thrust of your argument now is quite

16

in conflict with what was decided in the Retail Clerks* case

17

inthe Ninth Circuit — the broad thrust of your present

argument.

Well, I did promise at the beginning to -- X haven't

covered all of the considerations, but I think I've made clear

S

the heart of our argument with respect to this power to appeal.
X did. indicate earlier that X would say something

10

1?

about the mootness question, and before I sit

down X shall

12

address myself to that question.

13

and X don't want to deprive my brother of any time, and un­

14

less the Court is willing to give me a few more minutes, I

15

will sit down.

X see my light is flashing

IS

Q

Was that your red light?

17

A

That was my red light, Your Honor.

IS

Q

Five minutes.

19

A

May I have a few minutes, sir, so X can talk

2C

about the mootness?

21

Q

You may? go ahead.

22

A

All right.

23

The statute provides that a District Court may grant

.

X was reading.

Thank you.

24

such injunctive relief as if deems just and proper, pending the

25

Board's final adjudication

with respect to the matter.
46

1

Whether or not this case is moot depends upon what do we mean

2

by "pending final adjudication of the matter by the Board."

3

The Board —

4

Q

Based on what did you say?

5

A

What does that phrase mean, that the District

6

Court has the authority to grant interlocutory, injunctive

7

relief, pending the final adjudication of the matter by the

8

Board.

9

The Board has issued its decision and final order in

10

this case, and we say that that decision and final order of the

11

Board is the final adjudication of this case.within the meaning

12

of Section 10(1).

13

And with the issuance of the Board decision, which I

14

say constitutes its final adjudication, the power of the

15

District Court to grant any kind of an injunctive relief in

16

this case is at an. end.

17

Now, the union has, in fact, stopped its picketing.

18

As X said, the Board3s decision and order is presently pending

19

on review in the Court of Appeals.

20

its picketing in defiance of the Board's order, the Board is

21

empowered under Section 10(e) and (f) to go to the Court, of

22

Appeals and ask for such temporary relief as may be appropriate

23

in the circumstances.

2.4
25

If the union should resume

It's not mandated, but it's empowered to do so, and
presumably, if thereis a violation of the Board's order in this
47

case, the Board should not take very long in seeking to get
2

some temporary injunctive relief from the Court of Appeals,
Now, the argument is being made in this case here that

3

4
c.

final adjudication by the Beard — and I will be through in
just a few minutes, Mr, Chief Justice — the argument is being

6

made in this case here that final adjudication by the Board

7

does not mean the decision of the Board in a particular case,

8

but that the case is not finally adjudicated until it's run

9

itas entire course before the Board, as well as the court.
Now, I may briefly answer their argument by saying

10
11

that the statute does not say "final adjudication by the

12

reviewing court," it says "final adjudication by the Board,"
I think the case is moot, and I may say that I have

13

n

mixed feelings about our mootness question, having come this

15

far, becausewhile I think that our argument on the mootness is

16

strong, at the same time 1 would like to have an answer from

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, ManoXi,

Mr, Barr,
ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID S, BARR, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
48

MR» BARR;

1

Mr» Chief Justice,, and may it please the

2

Court;

3

insofar as its decision is concerned, is not. in conflict with

4

the position we fake in this case.

Mr» Justice Stewart,, the Food Employers Council case

5

The decision was that despite the fact that the

6

Re ional Director mi ht have preferred a settlement, and

7

thereby a dismissal of the petition, he could not tie the

8

hand of the District Court insofar as the discretion of that
Court is concerned in fashionin

a remedy.

That is not in conflict with the position we take.

10
11

The dictum in Food Employers Council is in conflict with the

12

position we take and the dictum was eliminated, for all intents

13

and purposes, in the Henderson case which Mr. Manoli referred

14

to, where they denied the ri ht to intervene.
The statute, if it please the Court, is not silent

15

16

on the question of the role of the char in

17

the lan ua e includes more than just the ri hts of the char in

18

party, but the role of all other persons involved in the

IS

char e.

2C

It says; "Upon the, filin

party, and in fact,

of any such petition, the

21

Court shall causa notice thereof to be served upon anyone

22

involved in the char e and such person, includin

23

party, shall be

24
25

the char in

iven an opportunity to appear by counsel and

present any relevant testimony.
So that means that what we're talkin
49

about

in this

1

case is not only the appeal rights, the independent appeal

2

rights of the charging party, but we're also talking about the

3

independent rights of all the primary and secondary employers

4

in every secondary boycott case.

5
6

7

For example, in this case, Joe and Eddie9s Carpet
Service, if Sears is allowed to appeal, would also be allowed
to independently appeal and so would, under this language,

8

every other primary and secondary employer involved, under

9

Section 10(1} because of its language.

1C

So, it's important to realise that we8re talking here
about more than just the'charging party role? we're talking

11
12

,

13
14

15

about these other persons' roles, as well.
The language"to appear by counsel and present
any relevant testimony” is language of limitation.
Q

Well, Mr. Barr, all of that argument is addressed

16

to the litigation in the first stage and we're, more or less

17

beyond that? aren't we?

18

appeal now? standing for review.

19

A

Yes.

We're talking about standing on

I'm talking precisely, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

about standing to appeal, standing to appeal when the REgional

21

Director refuses todo so.

22

If the language"shall be given an opportunity to

23

appear by counsel, and present any relevant testimony," gives

24

the right of appeal.

25

Q

Is that the language that you would use when you
50

1

are talking about an appellate review?

2

you would use when you are talking about the first phases of

C)

<r>

the litigation?

4

appellate level?

5
6

A

Q

/

9

There is no evidence presented at any

The statute, I admit, does not say precisely

"there shall be no right, of appeal/’ but —

«V

8

No.

Isn't that the language

Well, now while I have you interrupted for a

minute
A

but it is less than language which would have

10

given them party status.

11

parties shall be a party in the 10(1} litigation, even though,

12

in that very same section, Mr. Chief Justice, in the third

1.3

proviso, the labor organisation in 10(1) is expressly referred

14

to as a party litigant.

15

Q

Congress did not say that charging

Well, now, you haven't had a chance, really, to

16

digest, the opinions that Mr. Justice Douglas read this morning

17

in connection with the Data Processing case or the Barlow case.

!8

I suspect you glanced over them.

19

was nothing in the statute that gave any more aid and comfort

20

to the idea of appellate review relief than there is here.

21

Would you agree to that?

22

little bit more?

23

A

In both of those cases there

Or do you think there might foe. a

Unfortunately, the decision was read this raoming

24

has not been read by me* and so I cannot compare the facts in

25

that case to this one, but I would like to say
51

1

Q

2

A

We won't take advantage of you, then»
15rn very sorry‘ about that »

I would like to say

3

that quite apart from what may foe said in those decisions, I

4

don't know if you had in those decisions the limiting language

g

that you have here with regard to simply the right to present

6

relevant, to appear by counsel and present relevant testimony,

1

when viewed in light of the fact that Congress used the word

8

"party," and knew how to use it, not only in this same section

S

but in Sections 10(c) and (e) and particuarly in light of the

10

statutory scheme, whereby the Board only is empowered to seek

11

injunctions under Section 10(1), to institute injunction

12

proceedings under 10(j), to seek interim relief in the Courts

13

of Appeals under 10(e) and (f) and even under 10(f), Mr,

14

Chief Justice, where the aggrieved party is the party that

15

appeals, the interim relief can be afforded to the Board, and

16

not to the party that appeals»

17

So that not only the language, but the statutory

IS

scheme is evidence that Congress intended those words to limit

IS

the role of a charging party, as well as the other persons in­

20

volved in the charge»

21

22
23
24
25

And, of course, the legislative history, as far as we
are concerned, is absolutely compelling, because both Senator
Ellender, a strong supporter of S. 1126, and Senator Taft, its
chief sponsor, had to rise and make statements to the effect
that they strongly feared what would happen if private
52

1

litigants were given access to the injunctive process.

not to be dismissed as moot, because under the Southern

issue could never reach this Court.

24
25

The Counsel for Sears argued that this case ourhgfc

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY,GERARD C. SMETANA, ESQ.

MR. BARR;

I should first like to point out in

12

ficiaries under Section 10 CD.

in an 8{e) situation where there is a hot cargo case, which
was the Ninth Circuit Retail Clerks* case, it was the union
who was the charging party and it was the union who was seeking
to appeal, or> that unions in those situations, as well as in
8Cb)(4)(a) situations where they attempt to enforce or coer­
cively enforce illegal 8(s} contracts and also in 8(b)(4}D the
construction industry jurisdictional cases, the union is a
charging party in them.
Secondly, so far as the cases have decided appeallate
review, union counsel suggests that they have all given the
charging party amicus status.

1 would suggest, Your Honor,

that this is the first case where the issue has arisen where
the — where it involves a charging party as an Appellant and

61

I

1

there is considerable difference, because in the Retail

2

Clerks0 ease* although the charging party was relegated to

3

amicus status,

4

the appendix to our reply brief on the, in opposition to the

5

position for cert.

6

that appendix reflects the fact that the charging party, which

7

was only granted amicus status, however, presented oral

8

argument and presented briefs, and in fact, in the context of

S

the case, were the only ones to present that position.

20

I refer that 1 have to refer the Court foeick to

That9s supplemental appendix A-43,

And

Conversely, in our situatior, if we are not granted

party statuts we would be precluded from appealing from the

12

denial of injunctive relief.

13

trol is to hold, I would submit the Board’s argument on control

14

is wholly without reason, primarily because the Board is

15

suggesting that it could be in the position of, on the one hand,

16

having found reasonable cause where it was mandatorily required

17

to proceed with the Act; on the other hand, still maintaining

18

If the Board’s argument on con­

that reasonable cause, still going forward with the underlying

IS

case, but suddenly deciding that for some reason there might be

20

something that in appearing in the 10(1) situation, might in­

21

22
23
24
25

terfere with the ultimate victory in the underlying case,
I would submit that if that if that is their fear,
fine? let the chips fall where they will and the Board, perhaps,
will hai^e to pull out of the underlying case.

But, so long as

they maintain reasonable cause, so long as they don’t change
62

1

fcheir mind about the underlying ease., 1 don' fc know whether

2

they have a mandatory obligation to go forward,, but certainly

S

they cannot take the position that they must have control.

4

They have the control; they can change their mind on reasonable

5

cause.

That is the only kind of control.
And I would submit, in analysing the question of con­

6
7

trol, we must look to the kind of control the Board has urged

8

even in the court below.

8
IO

Circuit has said, "the language of 10(1) means that and no
more."
But, conversely, again looking at the scheme of the

n
12

13
14

15
16

Act, the Board in charge case, the charging party has many
rights that interfere with the .Board's control.

IS
20
21

once having gone to hearing, without giving the charging party
rights.
The Board cannot settle the Board case, once having
gone to complaint, without the charging party being heard.
These are the kinds — and I!m saying that that scheme of the
Act is also transposed to the language of being heard, being the
fact that it’s the same charging party.
I would, further the answer to the Norris-LaGuardia

22
23
24
25

The Board,

for example, cannot withdraw its complaint in the Board case,

17

IS

The Board would say, as the 10th

argument.

Mr. Manoli gave us a number of quotes both from his

argument and from his brief, with respect to the fears.
the persons who were annunciating the fears at that time,
63

Well

1

they were annunciating the fears that the passage of Taft-

2

Hartley would return us to Norris-LaGuardia and the very fears

3

that they were concerned about was the fear that anyone, be it

4

the Board or private parties would seek injunctive relief

5

before the merits were decided.

6

And I would submit that the Congress acted very

7

wisely in giving, in entrusting the Board with the responsi­

8

bility of seeking that relief.

9

reply brief on page 9, footnote 6 — footnote 3, pardon me.

10

11

As we have pointed out in our

The Board’s record is excellent.
Taking 1967 as a typical year and the only reason we

12

took 1967 is because/ we wanted to see what happened to all thos

13

10(1) cases where the Board went to final order,

14

words, there were 69 cases in that year; there were many other

15

10(1) — they had issued on 165 and there were almost 1500,

16

1800 charges under the Sections.

17

But the significant fact is that in those cases where

18

they went to final order, injunctive relief was either granted

19

or denied and the ultimate Board litigation, only one case was

20

there a cause to find that the Regional Director's original

21

cause, original basis for reasonable cause was in error.

22

So, I would submit that the Board — that the persons

23

of the charge party has not been generally disadvantaged in

24

terms of the REgional Director not being sustained in his

25

finding of reasonable cause, and I submit that the finding of
64

1

reasonable cause Is a central issue and so long as the

2

Regional Director maintains that reasonable cause, he cannot

3

say that he does not have control, because that is the

4

element of control.,

K

Simply, so far as the Henderson case, whibch counsel

6

have both cited, I would say that it is not very convincing.

7

The Ninth Circuit inthe Retail Clerks" case went to great

8

length to try to analyze the question.

8

was simply a summary discussion and really only addressed it­

<*>

The Henderson case

10

self to the question of amicus or intervention status at the

n

appellate level and that is consistent, first of all, with

12

the RetaiXClerks3 case, with respect to that question, and

13

I would submit that the *e is, however, a more fundamental

14

question when we are appellants, because in order toappeal we

15

must be considered a party.

16

And as 1 have said, a party minus the right to seek,

17

a party minus the right to urge, are the positions not consis­

18

tent with the original position.

IS

suggests, perhaps there is some third animal in the law which

20

could come out of this case, something less than a fully parky,

21

because we can't do all those other things, but yet someone

22

having the rights of a party and someone -- and where the

23

rights of an amicus are not sufficient, as the Court has said

24

in Scofield.
