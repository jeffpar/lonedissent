MR. LA FRANCE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
Mr. Padnos closed by saying that what he sought was the
opportunity to get into court.

I might begin by saying that

j

that is precisely what the Appellants seek in this case.
The Appellants initiated this proceeding by bringing a
civil rights action in the United States District Court.for the
District of Connecticut.

They alleged in a complaint that

they wishes, intended to sue their husbands for a divorce if
J
the Connecticut Superior Courts, but that as welfare recipients
they could not afford, to pay the court costs of approximately

17

$60 or more.

As a consequence, they had sent the divorce

18

19
20
21

22

papers to the Superior Court for New Haven County, with applications, asking that court to waive the filing fees and to
arrange service of process.

These papers we re all sent back

by the Clerk of that Court.
Upon receipt of these papers Appellants then asked

23

Superior Court. Judge Longo, and after speaking with him, the
24

State Supreme Court Administrator, Justice Cotter, reversed the
25

position which had been taken by the Superior Court Clerk,

Edward Horwifcz.

sequence, Appellants were

the courts of the State of Connecticut.

They sustained that position and as a con­
effectively barred from access to

They further alleged in their complaint in the District

Court that this denied them constitutional rights involving

due process and equal protection.

The .Appellees moved to dis­

judge panel and this, at direct appeal, was taken to this
Court.
The question which is thus presented is s

Has Connecti­

cut , be erecting economic barriers to its courts, denied these
Appellants the rights to due process and equal protection of
laws guaranteed to them by tie 14th Amendment of the United
States Constitution»
If I may turn first to a due process contention, we
find upon the right to petition for redress and grievance, a
right which is expressed in the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and which is incorporated into the 14th.
The decisions of this Court in N.A.A.C.P. versus
Button, United Mine Workers versus the Brotherhood of Railway
Engineers and the United Mine Workers -- I'm sorry.

The United

Mine Workers versus the Illinois Bar Association and the
Brotherhood of Railvciy Trainmen versus Virginia.
cases are squarely precedent for this.
3

All of these

i

■ The Appellees may attempt to distinguish them on the

2

ground that the litigation contemplated in Button was of a

3

political nature, whereas the litigation Appellants contemplate

4

is @f a personal nature, but that distinction was rejected in

5

the Mine Workers' case.

6

A second distinction, may be that these cases involve

7

the right of assembly, rather than the right to petition for

8

redress of grievances„ but we submit, the language of these

9

three cases discusses these two rights independently and

10

accords to them equal status.

11

right to petition for redress of grievances, indeed in these

12

cases there would hardly have been any point to assembly at

13

all if it had not been to enable individuals as here, to bring

14

suits on their own behalf.

15
16

17

m

25

The right of assembly and the

This is a fundamental right.

This Court has said that the right to sue and defend
in the courts is the alternative of force.

In an organized

society it is the right conservative of ail other rights and
lies at the foundation of orderly government.
Turning to our equal protection contention, it is clear
that the equal protection of the laws can ba denied by
economic discrimination as surely as racial discrimination.
This Court recognized that in Edwards versus California in
1941 and has reaffirmed it in many decisions since, most
recently in McDonald versus Board of Elections.

Perhaps the most significant case here is Griffin versus

4

S

Illinois where this Court .held that Appellate remedies could

2

not he denied to a person convicted of crime simply because

3

of his inability to purchase a transcript for appeal.

4

Appellee's brief at great length has attempted to distinguish

5

Griffin from this case»

6

Appellees have said, first* that Griffin is a criminal

7

case and that this is a civil case? the present proceeding»

8

In point of fact* this is a distinction which is not recognized

9

by the constitution* appears nowhere in the "Equal Protection

10

Clause*” and was not expressed by this Court in the decision

n

in Griffin versus Illinois.

12

criminal procedures* but with court procedure and it is court

37
13

25

Thatdecision dealt not with

procedures which these Appellants seek to pursue.
A second distinction offered in their brief by
Appell£*d3

is

tJiat in Griffin, liberty was involved* whereas

these Appellants are at large to go about as they choose.
a point of fact:

But

the liberty of these Appellants is sub­

stantially curbed by their inability to obtain divorces in the
courts of Connecticut? and this Court has recognized that,
liberty consists of more than simply freedom from physical
restraints.
A final point which Appellees have made in their brief
is that Griffin should not govern here because in Griffin the
State was the participating adversary.

It was the State which

had put Mr. Griffin in custody* whereas the divorce actions

5

s

contemplated by Appellants are private matters between husband

2

and wife.

&

4

5

It, is

the State which has barred these Appellants from its courts.

|

j

I

j

It is the State which has said to these Appellants that they
,

1

..

;

may not settle their marital affairs out' of court,

S

7

This,, however, is an illusory distinction.

Thus, on the one hand the State has required these

8

Appellants to go into court and at the same time has told them;
i
that they may not do so. We submit,, then, that the State is

S

fully as much an adversary in this proceeding as if was in

10

Griffin versus Illinois.
.

n

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Is that the basic difference, do

i

12

you suppose, between your case and other civil litigation,

13

generally, that parties are always free to compromise or

14

settle other quarrels, whether in the form of litigation or

15

not, but that a divorce matter, that is a civil case which can

16

only be decided by & judicial decree and cannot be compromiseds

17

is that right?

!

•

MR. LA FRANCE:

That is certainly one distinction,

Your Honor.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Of course, I suppose there could' tie

a compromise there, something short of divorce, here*.

22

MR. LA FRANCE:

23

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

I beg your pardon?
I suppose there could be a settle-

24

ment here, by something short of divorce, just as -- like there',

25

can be if somebody

suing you for $100,000, you settle for

6

1

something short of that.

2

MR. LA PRANCE:

I don't know of any legal proceeding in

3

Connecticut which would extend to these Appellants half a

4

divorce or one-third of a divorce.

B

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

6

Well, they could agree to live

apart.
MR. LA FRANCE:

7

They could agree to live apart,.

If'

a

they were to agree to that, which in point of fact, most of

3

them have done, what would happen is that they would be locked

10

into marriages which were meaningless, barren, but they would

n

also be cut off from some rather important rights: the right

12

to remarry, the right to procreate, the right to form new

13

families.

14

rights of considerable significance.

And this Court has said that those rights are

1 might also note, as we have in our brief, that denial

15
18

Of access to divorce for the poor poses peculiar problems

17

which may not be posed for other segments of society because

18

denial of that access aggravates the economic circumstances

19

under which the poor live.

ture

21

the poor.

22

It may also weaken the family struc­

tterns which sociologists indicate are prevalent among

Whether or not the peculiar problems for the poor are

23

cognisable

24

Connecticut*s law anybody who is cut off from divorce is cut

25

off from remarriage and is cut off from procreation with anyone

by this Court, it is at least clear that by

What we

What we are submitting is that since,, in fact, these

marriages have ceased to exist, in legal contemplation that

fact ought to be recognized.

MR* JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Fir» La Prance, the sums involved

here, I gather, are a minimum of $45 and a maximum of perhaps

7

a hundred; is that right?

21

MR. LA FRANCS;

Wall,

m first say that 'this court

22

could draw a distinction between this tyne of case and a c&z:

23

which involves purely personal, private issues — a negligence

24

suit, a contract suit, are examples of litigation which does

25

not involve the state in the same fashion that criminal
a

i

prosecution does? or a divorce suit does.

2

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

How about a bastardy proceeding?

3

MR. LA PRANCE: In Connecticut» a bastardy proceeding

involves the state rather extensively.

the Court is simply this:

What I would urge upon

that any time the State, whether it

state remedy through its courts»»

must be available to the poor and wealthy alike, whether it

reasoning would carry over to dog license, road tolls and

There is no constitutional right to a dog license, or I

— the passage through a toll road —

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

21

I contend that it does not.

The issue here is whether a constitutional right

The Appellees have noted that this

it?
MR. LA PRANCE:

If the right to travel were totally

the person who is thus barred has a constitutional claim and

any; so would Edwards versus California»

But I did not under­

If there is no constitutional right involved, as there

clearly is here, then perhaps this Court might distinghish

Do they have lawyers for the

Yes, they do.

I'm sorry.

case and a fair amount of intelligence»
...

We have those -in reasonable abundance in the State of

Connecticut.»

But, if barred from court; if her papers are

simply sent back by the Clerk of. the Court, without any con­
sideration, there is no opportunity to obtain justice at all,

MR» JUSTICE MARSHALL: What about appeal?
MR» LA FRANCE:

I'm sorry, I don't understand the

question.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

Well, assuming that the very

15
capable and heart-rending courts.you have in Connecticut, go
16
wrong and the Petitioner thinks he deserved a divorce and
17
didn't get it.

Does she have topay for an appeal?

18
MR. LA FRANCE:

I would submit that she does not have/ tc

20
21

pay the court costs incident to an appeal.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL:

Or printing, or briefs or

22
MR. LA FRANCE:

She might have to retain her own coun- ,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

What if she cannot afford it?

23
11
I

MR. LA FRANCIS:

i

If she cannot afford it.

I suppose that

2

that one other factor which is worth notincr and that is that

3

the prevalence of legal services programs andthe availability

4

of legal service attorneys takes some of the urgency out of ths

3

the concern for the availability of counsel.

6

relieve the urgency which is bellinu the issues raised by

7

Appellants i

this case.

MR# Ckfi'hh JUSTICE BURGER:

8

It does not

Well, is that a factor which

10

can be into consideration if this were cast in constitutional
terms, the fact that there are Neighborhood Legal Services and <

a

Legal Aid.

12

or there isn’t.

9

....

Either there is a constitutional right to counsel,

MR. LA FRANCE:

13

That is true, Your Honoi*.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

14

I was thinking in terns of the

15

Equal Protection Clause, the Constitution isn't very specific

m

as respects equal protection#

17

and Illinois to give the poor the record,free? and there is no

18

reference to the- right of appeal in the constitution.
MR. LA FRANCE:

19

We have applied it in Griffin

Well, that is correct, Your Honor, in

20

terms of whether the absence of a reference to appeal by the

2?

constitution in the Griffin case, in terms of whether that,
therefore, would require compelling the appointment of counsel

22

in civil cases, I would only respond that the appointment of

23

counsel is a matter which in criminal cases is specifically

24

provided for and the absence of reference to civil cases could

25

12
ii

t

justify this Court in infering that the drafters of the con­

z

stitution did not contemplate appointing counsel in civil

3

cases.

4

Now, am somewhat handicapped in arguing a case which

5

I’m not bringing? but; I do submit that if that case is brought

6

for the appointment of counsel in a civil case, this court

7

might well be justified in distinguishing this case from the

a

arguments which will be submitted at a later -time,

3
10

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

Oh, we might say that counsel

should be appointed by indigents in all civil cases,
MR, LA FRANCE:

11

You might well say that or you might

IE

say only in important civil cases, defining that in various

13

ways.

14

that this Court has coped with, for example, in Gideon versus

13

Wainwright, in determining whether counsel must be appointed

1®

only in felony cases or in misdemeanor cases — determining

17

the limit of the appointment requirementsof the constitution,

18

The problem here is not much different from the problem

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I suppose if we accepted

13

your argument that the right to divorce is of this absolute

20

nature, it would folldw that the right to go into the marriage

21

state would be at least comparable in stature? would it not?

22

MR. LA FRANCE:

Yes.

23

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: What about two people that

24

presented themselves for a $10 marriage license and said they

23

didn't have any money, but they wanted the-license

13

MR. LA FRANCE:

i

In this Court's ruling in Loving versus

2

Virginia, Skinner versus Oklahoma, I would say that the State

3

would be required to raise — I am sorry — waive that filing

4

fee and application for marriage if the applicants established

5

they could not pay the fee and if the state could not show a

S

legitimate.basis for imposing the fee.

7

Mow, I say that with the important emphasis that what

8

is involved is a fundamental right in marriage, according to
‘

9
10

this Court's decisions.

And I would therefore, distinguish

|

this from a dog license.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

MR. LA FRANCE:

12

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
23

Well, 1 think they ought to have

a dog-house license.
MR. LA FRANCE:

13
10

Or, perhaps, a hunting license.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

13
14

Or a hunting license.

With an automobile license the question

then becomes the very difficult one of equal protection of the
laws.
Presumably there is no constitutional —
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

I take it you also have the right

to travel involved there.
MR. LA FRANCE:

Yes.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:
MR. LA FRANCE:

And to work.

The right to work would not raise the

economic consideration which might lead to the conclusion that
equal protection had been denied.
14

The right to travel, in

j

I

itself, would foe a constitutional consideration and protected

by decisions of this Court.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

What provision of the constitution

do you claim affords the right to have access to the courts?

MR. LA FRANCE:

As

I read this Court’s opinions in the

Mine Workers6 case and the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen

case, the right to petition for redress of grievances involves
'
I
both private and official grievances.

14
15

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

But not the Button case?

16

MR. LA FRANCE; The Button case was primarily focused

18

upon official grievances, in the sense that the group there ir&.i

involved in advancing th<fe political, social interests of a

19

minority group which was being oppressed — I mean discrimin­

MR. LA FRANCE:

This

In Button that is true, but in the Mine j
|
Workers5 case and in the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, the \
IS

litigation contemplated was for private gain? for individual

benefit.

a

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

You say that a state is constitu­

4

tionally required to provide a forum for litigating any claim

5

of one private person against another.

6

our courts axe courts of limited jurisdiction and they have

7

jurisdiction to hear some kinds of claims, but not others.

B

There are just some kinds of things that we are going to leave

9

to the private sector to work out the best they can.

10

MR. LA FRANCE:

-It may not say that

What I’m sayinc is -- under that first

II

due process argument I am saying that you must afford*the.

12

opportunity to come into court and raise a claim.

S3

may not provide redress for that claim, but it must at least

14

provide an opportunity to petition for redress.

equal protection argument I am saying that where the state pro­

!6

vides a cause of action for a remedy, it must provide it equally .

The state

Under our

Now, it happens that the State’ of Connecticut provides

18

for a divorce.

19

tothe Appellants that they may not come into court and ask for ■

20

a divorce, nor may it say to the Appellants that divorce is

2!

available to everybody excepting the poor.

22
23

Given that, it seems to me that it cannot say-

MR. JUSTICE WHITE;

Well, that’s just an equal protection

argument? isn’t tit?

24

MR. LA FRANCE:

The two arguments... are quite close.

25

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

That’s not saying that this is

16

t

just a burden on a constitutional right* unless you can say

2,

there is a constitutional right* 1 suppose.
MR. LA PRANCE: The significance of the right to petition

3
4

for redress of grievances in this case* comes about because

5

of this Court’s decisions in such cases as Shapiro versus

S

Thompson* in which the Court has said that in order to justify |

7

racial discrimination or economic discrimination as legitimate

8

legislative policy, a state must show that there is a compelling

9

necessity for that discrminiation.

It may not show simply that

10

there is a rational basis for it* but there must be a compel1-. I

MR. CANNON;

I don't think the state has a legitimate

6

interest to waive all court fees, unless it’s within the realm

7

of the legislature to do it; they could do it, of course

8

they would have to provide tax measures also, because the entry

fees do help to support the judiciary system.

are concerned in a divorce case, the state is more or less

12

standing on the sidelines.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Cannon, if a screening

procedure were set up which required the people who could not
pay the fees to go through screening in order to get a waiver
of the filing fees and other costs, would that not be a denial
of equal protection because rich people would not have to go
through that screening process?

litigation by the poor? in other words, it bars all litigation

by the poor, whether frivolous or not. and matters of consequence

which we feel denies constitutional rights.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

16

wanted a divorce.

MR. LA FRANCE:

X5m sorry; am 1 contending that?

18

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Are you not?

Afe you arguing that

19

because a rich man canhire a lawyer to get a divorce, the state

20

must supply a lawyer for a poor woman or poor man who wants to

21

get a divorce?

No, I'm not.
Well, how could you keep from doing

that if you made them pay the cost.

That was transcript on appeal, Your

MR. JUSTICE BLACK: But you wouldn’t say that they would

MR. LA FRANCE:

All he would have to do, I suppose, in

are granted, present his two witnesses, usually consisting of a

MR. 'JUSTICE BLACK:

All I do contend is that what is required

state will go farther and provide counsel.
