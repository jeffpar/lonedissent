ORMi ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF ABPELLANTS

MR, MELTSNER:

■

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it. please

7

the Court, this case is here-on appeal from a final judgment

8

of the statutory three-" judge court convened in the Southern

9

District of Georgia,

to
11

it was brought in 1967 by Negro

Appellants as a class action challenged violations of the 13th .
i

14th and 15th Amendments by Georgia statutes in State Con­

12

stitutional provisionsp which set up an interlocking system

13

of jury and school board selection, and also to enjoin racial

14

discrimination in the enforcement of these statutes by

15
16
17
13

19

Appellee officials in Tolliver County, Georgia,
Appellants made three claims in this court, that the
Georgia statute which authorizes jury commissions to exclude
persons from service they deem not intelligent and upright is
void for want of standards? secondly, that the District Court

20

failed to grant adequate relief to reform racial selection of

21

jurors and school board members? and -third, that a restriction

22
23

24
25

•that school board members be freeholders or real property
owners, violates the equal protection clause.
The Georgia system for jury and school board selec­
tion which is at the center of this case, begins when &

are not the right age and haven't resided in the county for

In this case, Tolliver County is one of sis counties

The judge then selects six citizens in each, comity to

They

11

then reduce the number remaining randomly in order to get a

12

workable number and place that number on a traverse jury list.

13

From the traverse'-list they select not more than two-fifths

14

From this list the Superior

\

13

Court Judge selects names which ultimately .constitute the

IS

county grand jury.

17

Q

The judge himself performs that last function?

18

A

That's correct.

He chooses 32 names from the

19

grand jury list and calls the persons into court, hears

20

excuses and then takes the first 23 names remaining on the list

Q

21

And the judge himself selects the 32 from how

many, two-fifths of the whole?

22

A

23

Mot more than two-fifths; they, number about 130

in this county.

24

Q

25

Il

And he selects those subjectively, or does he

3

\

pick them from random selection?

2

A

He takes them from a box randomly.

He picks

O

32 names; the sheriff goes out» calls those 32 into court.

The judge then hears excuses

Mow» the grand jury» 'among its - functions» elects the
five-man county school board when vacancies occur» from the
freeholders in the county.

And the school board is responsible:

for the management and.operation of the'schools in the county.
Q

What is the term of this grand jury?

How long

dees it stay in existence?
A

It’s abdut six months» I think» the term of

court; each grand jury.
Q

And what is the term of the members of the

school board selected by the grand jury?

.18

A

Five years.

19

Q

So the grand jury performs the function

21

A

Whenever there happens to be ,a vacancy.

Now» if

22

there is a death or resignation the school board will pick an

23

interim candidate which the next grand jury will then act and

24

is free to select whoever it wants for the position.

Now, I think it is assumed by all the

24

the jury commissioners and school board members that there was

25

racial discrimination in the sd.ee:tion of the jury and -that the

5

I

1

exclusions of blacks- from the school board could not continue.

2

The Court ordered the defendants to make an attempt to remedy

3

•the situation and suggest -1- that two blacks be put on the

4

school board prior to a reconvening of the court# a month

5

later.

6

The jury commissioners during this period*, re­

7

compiled the jury list# placing additional Negroes on it and

8

a' new grand jury was selected.

9

excluded 171 Negroes and only 7 whites because they failed to

10

meet the statutory requirement, that jurors be intelligent and

11

upright.

.

However# the commissioners

i

12

The new grand jury made two appointments to the

13

school board.

14

The black man chosen had a third grade education# no children

15

in the school and he was selected without the public notice

16

which is required by Georgia Law.

17

One was a v&ite man and one was a black man.

On the basis of the recomposition of the jury list#

18

addition of one Negro to the school board and its view as to

19

the constitutional questions presented# the District Court did

20

enjoin interracial exclusion in the selection of the grand

21

jury and denied further relief.

22

Appellant's first contention in this Court is that

23

Section 59-106 Georgia Code# violates the 14th Amendment by

24

authorising jury commissioners to exclude they deem to be not
\

25

upright and intelligent.

'

6

Now, certainly these terms, or the synonyms used by

1
2

Georgia officials to characterise their-meaning, with words

•o

like understanding or honesty, are words which have no commonly

4

accepted meaning. They are matters of personal judgment unless

S

they are applied to some objective standard as they are not in

There were several consequences to their use which

The court has condemned placing

15

co-missloners exercise a similar function, there is no reason

why a different rule should apply.
Secondly, because men cannot agree to the meaning

17
18

of these terms, their application to particular individualsr

19

they almost command arbitrary, erratic and inconsistent judgf

20

meats between individuals.

2t

terms, it seems to me are basically inconsistent with the

22

notion of due process of lawvs that law rather - than men will

govern whether or not one can exercise a right.

outh,

Do you,,think they are any

less? broad than the term "unreasonable," for example* in the
"Fourth Amendment in relation to searches?
A

Well* X -think the language is often vague and

undefined and certainly the word "reasonable" in the Fourth
Amendment is a vague word.

But its function is totally

different from the functiori of these words.

Its function is fee

guide the Court in its decisions of cases and it is construed
by the Court in accordance with history and its own decision.
Q

Then how about the situation when a trial judge

instructs a jury on a reasonable man standard.

tion, which this is — this form of statute has.
Secondly, a jury deciding*a negligence case, for

©

example, is not selecting among individuals in the community.

j

?

It is perhaps exercising an ad hoc judgment which, in certain

8

circumstances the law allows.

-

i
The question is whether the

10

already condemned in many, many other areas, are necessary,

11

hnd I submit that they are not here and there is no state in-

12

terest involved in allowing the jury commissioners this much

13

discretion to select among individuals at their will.
Q

14
15
16
17
18

Suppose the last three or four years, the record

in this case now shows that due to a change and attitude, and
a change in heart, the selection of these people was made an .
— as a result ©f about 45“55 in one term and 55-45 the next
time, and was roughly, over a long period of time, balanced in

19

the way that reflected, or very nearly approximately, the

20

population balance of the community.

Would your quarrel still

:

21

then, be withthe statutes?

h

22

Oh, yrs.

1 think the error in this statute —

23

the' infirmity in this statute is the arbitrary power which it

24

confers.

25

Now, the evidence of racial discrimination which .this

record has in abundance.

For example, the exclusion of 171

0

j

I

of 178 persons of the Negro race under this standard is

2

evidence of this capacity for abuse, quite strongly, 1 think.

o

Our quarrel would still exist with the statute because the

4

problem of the statute is that it makes almost impossible the

s

selection between individuals which is not erratic and which

6

does not depend on'the will cf the selecting official.
How, 1 think that another thing that one might con~

7
S

sidar here is that is totally impossible to review and

9

appriase and evaluate the decisions made by these jury commis­

10

sioners.

n

178 persons lacked — that can't be.

12

'there and prove 'that5 one can't evaluate it; one can’t review

13

it, and that is a. function . ' which this Court has always

14

apparently employed, the vagueness analysis to permit.

15

there is some specificity, there is absolutely no way for the

adjectives out?

And that wouldn’t give him any more or

stricter standards, would it?
.

19

A

It would certainly remove from him the capacity

20

to disqualify persons on the basis of his subjective will,

22

his subjective understanding of these elusive concepts.

22

Q

I should think with no standards at all there

23

would be certainly as much capacity for anybody to exercise

24

his power in a discriminatory fashion.

25

A

Well, on — I -think as the statute is written,

10

this is clearly a disqualification of voters who are, at the

beginning deemed eligible*

1 think, if I understand your question, fir.

;

More objective than they are.
And you are arguing this, as I get your brief,

!

18

in the context of what the practises have beenin this section

;

19

of the country; is that it?

20

A

That is correct»

21

Q

That brings me back to my hypothetical.

Let ms j

22

alter it a little bit and suppose the record showed that in

23

recent years, since there was a change of heart and attitude,

24

that 70 parcent of the persons selected by this jury commission

25

had been Negro, and only 30 percent whites . On what basis

12

1

would you attack the' statute?

2

A

Well* I think that before one would find

3

consistent results of that statute with a statute of this kind,

4

there would have to be brought into it some form of objective

5

line-drawing standards .

6
7

Q

But what would be your complaint in that

factual setting?

8

A

Then, perhaps as © litigant* 1 would have no

9

complaint* but in this case andother eases of this sort* the

10

complaint is there is an inherent capacity for arbitrariness.
Q

1!

Doesn't that bring us back to just what you had

12

discussed with Mr» Justice
Stewart and Mr. Justice Harlan*
r

13

that it’s the practice* not the statute* that1s the vice here?

14

With what’s being done* not what could be done* which is

15

important?

16

A

My position is that in this case both are

17

important; both are here and that the Court should decide this

18

case.

19

statute has nothing to do with results.

20

confirms the vice which we see in it.
Q

2!

22
23
24

25

But I must take the position that the vice of this

Would you say that again?

The result clearly

This act has nothing

to do with the results* did you say?

t

A

The infirmity in this statute is in its grant

of arbitrary power* just as in the licensing of —

1 think X am right, or

Do you think you could make this argument in the
context of litigation there?
A

X think that a litigant in a class excluded

would be able to make that argument? yes, X certainly do.
But, I wish to come back to the State of Georgia,
because there's another aspect of the jury commission which X

10

think the Court ought to consider.

1!

involved here, but the grand jury has been given a political

12

function, and so the'operation of this statute is to exclude

as

blacks from selecting public officials.

14

jury system involved here, it5s excluding black people in this

as

county from choosing the school board.

16

Not only is jury selection ;

It3s.not just the

And so, as important as participating in the adminis­

17

tration of justice is, we have even moreimportant rights at

18

stale© hero.

19

j

My second claim — the second claim that we wish to

20

present to the Court is that the District Court did not &de~

21

quateXy reform the system ©f jury and school board selection.

22

Now, certainly if the Court strikes down the broad discretion

23

which Georgia law grants the jury commissioners, that will, no

n

doubt make far more likely non™racial jury and school board

25

selection but they still need more equitable relief to

14

1

eliminate the effect of past discrimination„ and to make it

2

unlikely to recur in the future.

3

Initially, the present school board still has on it

4

a person selected by the grand jury which, by themselves, was

B

unconstitutionally selected, and one step we think that the

Q

District Court should be required to take on remand, is to

7

vacate feh® membership of the board in order to end the effects

8

of past discrimination and make a break with the past. '
Mors fundamentally, to make sure that discrimination

9
10
11

12.

13
14

does not occur, at a minimum the District Court should, appoint
black jury commissioners as was sought in the complaint.
The commissioners play a critical role in this process and a.
small amount ©f discrimination- in the future would tip control
gradually to whites.
They have discriminated in the past? there has never

15

16

i1
18
19

been a black jury commissloner and the whole process works over
the issue which blacks in this county have an enormous interest;
Whites, on the other hand, have no interest comparable- in
educational quality.
I think it's little like the voter registration, if

20
21

22
23
24
25

I can use that —- the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ii I can use
that analogy, where the statute provided that under certain
circumstances the courts might appoint voting registrars to
administer even a nondiscretionary system of voting registra­
tion.

The record in this case and the activities of Appellee

15

1
2
3

officials here makes similar relief, at a minimum, necessary.
Q

Are the only standards for selection in Georgia

these words you used in your question?

4

A

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED L. EVANS, JR.,

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GEORGIA,

Mr. Evans.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

Right o

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

23

please the Courts* 'There is no question but that Georgia's

24

jury selection statute is capable of being improperly ad­

There in no question but that in Tolliver Comity,

6

This is the true question before the Court for two

7

simple reasons:

First of all, it is self-evident that when­

8

ever law requires judgments be exercised, there is the

9

possibility they may be exercised improperly, or wrongfully.

Secondly, bee

11

as they are, we can anticipate that from time to time

12

statutes providing for 'the exercise of judgment will be ad­

13

ministered improperly.

14

-

Now, of course, the question of jury qualifications

15

goes to the very heart of the concept of trial by jury, a

16

concept which this Court, just a little more than a year ago,

17

in Duncan versus Louisiana, declared to be "fundamental to the

18

American scheme of justice»"

19

State legislatures, including Georgia's General

20

Assembly, have quite generally supposed that the right to trial

21

by jury means ferial by jurors who are, first of all, possessed

22

of intelligence sufficient t© understand the matters they may

be.called upon to judge.

As a matter of fact, pupil expenditure did go

Infche very short time that is left I

am going to try and deal with two or three of these issues
first.
Mr. Justice Brennan, assuming that the Court
eliminates the capacity for discrimination and the upright and
intelligence —

Strikes that down.

A

Yes.

We have concluded that the most appropriate

remedy is for the District Court to try Kt.d. m ike their system

And we think

I can't hear you.

I am sorry=

We think that if this statute is

knocked down by the Court? if our challenge is successful,

that the most appropriate way for the District Court to

7

assure that, the system of school board selection and jury

Put

Well, tell me, Mr. Meltsner, 1 notice that your

13

complaint asks and on the premise that the statute was struck

14

down,that you wanted membership on the board of education and

15

jury commission to be declared vacant, a receiver be appointed

16

to operate tie public schools and the selection of a constitu­

17

tionally acceptable board and a special mass to select members

13

of the grand and petit juries and that ancillary damages fos

19

awarded.

20

Do you still ask for all that relief?
A

Well, we do not ask this court for ssicdllary

21

damages, but all that relief may be appropriate in the District

22

Court to devise a system which will assure fair selection here.

You don’t think a mere declaratory judgment

would be enough?

Absolutely not.

there was a declaratory judgment,, 96 percent of the persons

Stewart, these statutes, with the exception of the cross-

I just wish to make it perfectly clear that we do
not disagree has an interest in intelligent and upright jurors.
We merely assert that the test involved in this statute is not
the way to achieve that end.

It grants too much discretion

and invites racial discrimination.

Q

Well, would you consider that if you prevail

on your, facial attack here that the statutes in these 21 other

states would have to go, too?

I think some of them definitely will, but I

think in most of them — my own experience is that in most of

6

them they are administrative procedures grafted onto them,

which make the selection much fairer»

these statutes will have to go.
