ORAL ARGUMENT OF HONORABLE RICHARD W. MC LAREN

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT UNITED STATES
MR. MC LAREN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

May it

10

please the Court, I will direct my argument to case Number 28,

II

the United States v the Interstate Commerce Commission.

\z

a civil case that comes to the Court on direct appeal from the

13

judgment of a three-judge District Court.

14

denied the Government's request for an injunction and upheld the

IS

X.C.C.'s approval of the merger of the Great Northern and the

10

Northern Pacific Railroad that has been referred toin our brief

17

as the Northern Lines and their various railroad subsidiaries,.

18

This is

The District Court

The merger has been stayed by this Court's Order

19

The issue in this case is whether the I.C.C. correctly applied

20

the Public Interest Test of Section 52(b) of the Interstate

21

Commerce Act vhe-s. it approved this merger, holding that the

22

savings and service benefits of the merger outweigh the

23

elimination of substantial railroad competition between the

24

Northern Lines and the northern tier of Western States,

25

V

Case number 43, the City of Auburn case is related to

4

1

our case and it also raises competitive issues.

The other two

z

cases. Case Number 38, the Brundage case, involving the fair­

3

ness of the merger terms to Northern Pacific stockholders, and

4

Number 44, the Livingston case, questioning the Northern

5

Pacific's title to its property, raise unrelated issues.
Now, although the record in this case is a very long

6

,First, X would like

7

one, the basic facts are relatively simple.

8

to identify the roads which propose to merge in terms of the

S

areas they serve.

The latter shows the applicant roads as they will
appear when it has merged.

Looking first at the Great.

Northern5s map, the bigger one, you will see that the Great
Northern trunklines are at the top in red.

With its affiliates,

Great Northern carries on operations over some 8200 miles of road
in the northern tier states, from Minneapolis and Duluth —Duluth in the east, to Spokane, Seattle, Portland and other
terminals in the Pacific Northwest,
Northern Pacific is green on the map and its
affiliates operate over some 6800 miles of road somewhat south

1

of the Great Northern and they serve the same main terminals as

the Great Northern in Minnesota and the Pacific Northwest.

on the

Now, there is no dispute that the Northern Linas are

14

financially strong firas.

'35

They own vast acreage of valuable

16

land and mineral rights, as well as rail and motor carrier

17

assets.

IS

fair to say that their profits have fluctuated over the years

13

and do not reflect a large percentage of setiVtftt on their invest­

They are also regularly profitable, although it's

Q

How do these compare 'with the Penn-Central

merger in.site?
ft.

1 believe, Mr* Justice Harlan, that in package

it is bigger; in. terms of revenue it is not as big.

6

Q

Mot as big.

7

ft

I8m not positive of those figures.

8

As the rosps seem to indicate, the Northern Lines

9

are head-to-head competitors for traffic across the northern

10

tier states.

Each is the main competitor of the other and the

31

Milwaukee is a very weak third.

12

competition —- rail competition and intermotor competition in

13

this area is covered by the findings in the I.C.C reports as

14

I will describe in just a moment.

The nature and extent of this

IS

To simaarize,the proceedings in the Interstate

S6

Commerce Commission there are two main reports, the first

n

disapproved the merger on grounds that it would have a drasti­

18

cally adverse effect on competition as well as adverse effects

19

on its employees.

20

The second report, on recoi si.deration reversed and

21

then approved the merger.

I should say that the findings of

22

fact in the first report are of significance, since they are

23

largely found again the second report which is based on sub­

24

stantially the same record.

25

will point out.

There are a, few

8

exceptions, as I

1 also think that the rationale of the first report

1
2

is important since it is out contention that it applied the

3

correct legal standards, whereas
Q

4

the second report did not.

I wonder if this set of figures in the

S

prospectus will help me if you will pinpoint the figure that

6

you have in. mind of the competition which will be eliminated

7

in terms of practice in the northern tier in which these two

e

roads operate.

9

6 percent there in one aspect and another figure? could you

m

I8m talking about a figure of somewhere around

pinpoint those for me?
A

n

I believe that the figures that Your Honor
f

/

12

is recalling has to do with approximately 6 percent at points

13

wh$r<3 the Northern Lines are the only rail service.

14

that there is another figure of some 37 or 33 percent where

15

they compete for revenues and there is also some other competi­

16

tion.

25

1 believe

And the broad figure that we use and that I will get into

in. some further detail later is that the Northern Lines directly
compete for around 43 percent of their revenue and there is an
additional overhead portion of their revenue, 12 percent.

So,

we‘re contending that they are eompetitOM for about 55 percent
of their revenue.

There are some other figures as to the per­

centage of the market they have, which I will get to.

It runs

67 and 80 percent in different areas.
To review just briefly the proceedings in the
Interstate Commerce Commission, they began in 1961 when the

Applicants petitioned for authority to merge.

when this was eliminated the merged road would have -a' dominant

For example, it found that the —- together the

Northern Lines would handle 61 percent of the carload traffic

moving westbound in the northern tier and 83 percent east-bound.

ICC found that the Northern Lines were in direct competition, as
X mentioned at points accounting for 43 percent of their
revenues, and further that they competed for overhead traffic
accounted for another 12 percent, thus the merger would
eliminate competition between them for 55 percent of their total
revenue.
As to tse Milwaukee Road the ICC found that for
various reasons it was a handicapped and weak competitor.
accounted for only 12 percent of east-west traffic in the
northern tier.

The first report recognized that the Milwaukee

could be strengthened by conditions attached to the merger and
it considered these conditions: principally the granting of

traffic rights into Portland, Oregon and into Billings,

Montana and the opening of II gateways where it could exchange

though they had all these gateways and the new terminal on the

coast at Portland,, they still would be relatively weaker.

out that the new company would have what it referred to as

18

Justice Black, because the Court has laid out the requirements
for an accommodation of the Transportation Act, the organization
of roads into systems and serving the needs and requirements of
efficient transportation.
On the other hand, the Courthas held we do haveaa
national policy favoring competition and that the cases say thau
the Commission in approaching these merger cases must accommo­
date the views and the policies of these two statutes.

Well, ye're opposing it on the theory, Mr.

railroads, they do not need this merger in order to continut to

the requirement of accommodations of the policy of the Transpor­

such an anti-competitive merger not ba permitted unless it
serves a real public need and that that kind of elimination of
competition should not be permitted to serve the private
interests of 'the parties and if there are public interests that
are being served by the merger, but if they could be served by
a less anti-competitive alternative, then the merger should not
be permitted.

The less competitive alternatives should be put

into affect by the Interstate Commerce Commission which, after
all, under the law, is given vast powers and great discretion to
regulate and to supervise the affairs of the railroads.
And in this case it is our contention, that the
Commerce Commission should have considered to what extent it
could have opened up the gateway in order to strengthen the

16

Q

Well, then, what's wrong here is, in your view,

17

is that the Commission, although it found there would foe better

service, didn't make an express finding that they could not

achieve these results by another route?

White.

That's one of the things? yes, Mr. Justice

They did find that in the first report.

let's assume the Commission in the second report had made that

finding, would you foe here?

Yes.

I think if they made that finding and that

think that they would have that power.

wouldn't be here, because I think that then the Court has a

5

right to look at this situation and see if the — if that

S

determination is supported by substantial evidence.

7

as a question in this particular ease, that the Commission has

8

done more than really give lip service to the question of the

9

value of competition.

10

I am not sure that we

And 1 see

They have followed the dissent, the point

that I made a little earlier, that after all, these giants have

Now, on the second report the Commission came out
and they said that this is a matter of where we were in error
on the savings that will come from the merger.

There, will be

some $39 million in savings after a few years instead of 22 or
25 million earlier estimated and they dwell at some length on
the improved service which ultimately would result from the
merger, but they did cite no prospective service benefits that
had not been considered in the first report.
And I think it's fair to say that what they did do
infchs second report was to discharge or reverse two principles

23

1

of analysis which had been followed by the majority in the

2

first report.

3

they determined to focus not. so much on competitive effects on

4

the northern tier states where competition would be eliminated,

5

but rather they broadened out the focus and they took the broad

Q

view of the total area that was served by all the merger

7

parties, included that down in the central corridor which is

8

served by the Burlington.

petition looked somewhat less drastic, taking that view.

substantial intermotor as well as intramotor competition,

15

though it survived the merger.

Would it also be correct to say that they took

That was argued in the lower courts, Mr. Justice

Both sides in both reports?

23

A

Yes, sir.

There was an indication in the first

report that there is a presumption in favor of mergers.

25

On the

And then the second thing in effect, said in the second report

is that it does appear that they in effect, did accept the

idea that there is a presumption in favor of mergers that are

brought out by the private parties in the second report., whereas

5

they gave competition a certain value and weight in the first

report that they didn't in the second report.
The difficulty, as they pointed out the first report,

Mr. Justice Stewart, is you have the difficult task of weighing

an intangible value, competition.

followed in the Denver — it was followed in the Minneapolis-

19

St. Louis case and it has been referred to at various times

20

since then.

21

recent cases have cast some additional light on this in the sense

22

that the Court has treated competition as a basic policy and

23

it has treated the power of the administrative agency to grant

24

25

I think that there is some indica­

That was spelled out in McLean.

It was

I think that two or three of the Court's more

immunity from that as carrying a rather important determination
that is to be made by the administrative agency.

3

Q

Are you referring to cases like the Maritime

Commission case, Svenska or whatever it is?
A

Svenska is one of them? the Denver-Rio Grande

4

case, I think is one of them.

That's the Railway Express

5

Agency stock purchase and in the Denver-Rio Grande opinion there

6

is a passage that has to do with it and it points out that this

7

52 power is the power to grant immunity from the policy which

8

favors competition and it implies that, this is a matter of

9

considerable importance for the Commission to determine.,

And I

10

think that when yon then get to the Svenska case, true, that

n

was a Maritime case and true that was not a merger case but it

m

did specifically mention two of the rail merger cases and it

13

said that those case followed the same pattern.,

14

Q

Mr. McLaren, as I read this record, there are

some very, very substantial reductions in the time runs.

on agricultural products, which is one of the figures that. I

17

have here in my mind from the apple-growing country in Oregon and

18

important factor isn't it in this day of speed?

A

Yes, it certainly is, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now,

What

I point out now is that the original figures came out and I

22

don’t remember them precisely, but I think the rail time from

the Northwest down into the Chicago area was something like 94
hours and they said, "When we merge we can put together better,
more direct routes and we can cut 12 hours off of that.

point out that they —* this came up on the Maritime Commission' s

power, which is comparable to the Commission's power to grant

immunity to an anti-competitive arrangement and there I think it

20

was an explicit dealing arrangement and referring to the

21

22
23

question ofthe national economic policy, the Court pointedout
that an otherwise illegal arrangement, as the Court said,

In other words, although you disagree with the

suggestion in the question of Mr. Justice Brennan that the
Commissio®, in fact, applied the same basic standard in each
case and it came out differently.

At least I would suppose if

there were changes in the facts, as I understand there were,
that it would have been quite possible for the same Commission
to apply the same standards and come out differently and the
changes to which I refer are: first of all, the petition by
these applicants which led to the second report accepting every
single one of the conditions affecting the Milwaukee? every
single one of .the conditions affecting the Chicago-Northwestern
i
agreeing fully to enter into collective bargaining agreements

33

'i

with the representatives of their employees to take care of

attrition, and finally pointing out that the profits that would

7

in facts were evident; were present at the time of the second

report, it would be quite conceivable that you could apply the

same standards and come out with a different result»
I'd like to answer that if I may.

10

As far as the

11

conditions are concerned, Mr. Justice Stewart, 1 think in the

12

first report they assumed the conditions as to the Milwaukee,

13

at least, which I think are preeminent.

14

they assumed the attrition agreements in favor of employees and

15

it's true that in the first report they pointed out that it was

18

both the anti-competitive effect and the adverse effect upon

17

employees.that was bad.

Now, 1 am not sure that

But the main conditions for the Milwaukee, 1' think,

18
19

had been considered.

As far as the savings are concerned, the

20

new evidence that came' in — there were just four days of hear­

21

ing on reconsideration — three of them with a proposed one for

22

rebuttal, and the savings therewith additional evidence had

23

largely to d® with simply an adjustment factor, applying a

24

percentage to previously estimated — previously estimated

23

savings.

So, 1 don’t think that that was a matter of new

34

1

evidencef particularly.

2

Now, the fact that the Anti-Trust Division petitionee

3

that the matter be reopened both to find out how many more

4

changes there had been already put into effect, like this

5

faster train business and so on and also what savings had been

6

achieved and could be achieved without merger and this was

7

denied by the Examiner and was held by the Commission.
Q

8
9

As I understood your answer, there was at least

one fundamental change in the facts between the first hearing

10

— the time of the first hearing and the time of the second

n

hearing and that is the elimination of any problem with respect

12

to attrition of the employees.

Now, the basic character of Northern Pacific changed

after 1951 when substantial oil was found in the Williaton Basin.

The State recognised this when they eliminated Northern Pacific

But perhaps the best thing to do is to quote first

what the Commission said and then what the District Court, said.

12

Let me quote from the Commission — this is in 297 in your

13

appendix.

14

"The issue hers is whether the exchange ratios are

IS

just and reasonable and limited thereto we find the record

16

both adequate and affirmative in that they meet the necessary

Now, what the District Courts say: "On the basis of

to rule or to permit the ratio which was established, with

38

1

Mow, let's take a look at Section 5.

There are

2

really three steps involved in achieving a railroad merger.

3

The. first is that the parties have to agree on something,.

4

second is that the Commission then takes action, supposedly

5

independently and that they approve these; terms or they modify

6

them under Section 52, to achieve what the test is of justice

7

and reasonableness.

8
9

The

And the third thing that happened: After the
Commission was all through with the tests then you must have

10

assent of the stockholders by an appropriate vote.

11

Court's view is one that is quite independent of any agreement

12

of the parties or stockholder approval.

13

agree because the ICC objects.

14

is only in there having to do with relevance as to the enforce­

15

ment of whatever the Commission has found.

16

Now, -the

The parties don’t

And the stockholder approval

So that the area here is in relying for the decision

17

on irrelevant things as the agreement of the parties in the

18

first place and the subsequent approval by the stockholders.

19

This, we claim has legal bearing-

20

Now, there is no relation to Section 5 of arms

21

length bargaining, not at all.

22

at all is at the subdivision. 11 where it says that it. is a

the stockholders.

Now, all that we claim is that Section 5

X think it might be helpful

First, let’s take the arms length bargaining busi­

9
10

ness.

May I say we impute no fraud or chicanery to the

n

negotiators of these terms, perfectly responsible people; we

12

recognise that.

13

But, the common interests which they have had in

14

joint ownership of the Burlington, running back to 1901 and

IS

holding ownership of the SP and S in which the persons alter­

16

nated as presidents of the SPS and the joint operations of the

17

Manitoba Railroad, you just couldn’t: have this kind of arms

18

length bargaining which 1 think any court would consider to be

19

arms length bargaining.

20

But of more disturbing importance is the conflict

21

of interests that shows up on the. part of the two members of

22

the five members on the Northern Pacific Consolidation Committee

23

which was the negotiating committee.

14

Pacific stock and more than 46,000 of Great Northern stock.
Now, the legal definition of what constitutes

15

IS

market value and this Court in Schwahacher posited the fact that

17

the true criterion was the present intrinsic or market value of

18

the contribution to be made by the various groups.

19

in mind, the general legal definition is what a knowledgable

20

and willing trade is — who wanted to make a deal and a trade,

21

acting under no compulsion at all, what figure would they

22

arrive at?

Having that

Now, let’s take a look at that much that is in this

’Now, how soft the bargaining was in this matter is

7

shown by when they got up to discussing the industrial pro­

8

perties which both railroads had, Northern Pacific had been

3

evaluated at $32,700,000, so they are not talking about peanuts.

10

The financial advisor for Northern Pacific was willing to take

11

really the assurance without any appraisals that the two men

12

had, that they had properties of very substantial character.

Q

That0s a dollar and fifty cents.

A

Yes; and it keeps going down until it's redeemed

Now, I have about concluded the first points.

As to

the issue interpretation, Section 5, in laying stress on the
arms length bargaining and the stockholders' vote.
tod now we come to Point 2.

44

That is that there is

1

just not reliable, probative, substantial evidence in the whole

2

record to support the finding of the Commission and the District

3

Court that these terras are just reasonable*under Section 5.
Now, the unique problem in this case is to determine

price earnings ratio of 15 times earnings in. 1960 when the

terras were agreed upon as an appropriate one and that hasn't been

19

questioned anywhere in the record.

20

The real issue is:

The real issue

how are you going to value these

21

natural resources?

The Applicant’s positionon that in the

22

record was that it’s difficult., if not impossible to value

23

respective stocks, except on the basis of capitalisation earnings.

24

But they made an attempt to value stocks by separate valuation

2.5

and they found it impractical; why?

45

Because they couldn't agree

1

on the stock ratio, because there’s difficulty evaluating these

2

properties, on account of market conditions and the uncertain”

3

ties of their future potential.

4

"‘no definitive evaluation'" of the property.

So, they made what they called

They said in the last analysis it just has to be a

5
6

question of judgment.

Now, the Committee’s position was and is

7

that to arrive at a proper intrinsic stockmarket value of these

8

two stocks, which is what Schwabacher mandated, it is more

9

appropriate to take a market value of them than to measure them

10

on the basis of capitalisation of earnings.

current earnings and capitalise it in the marketplace there

12

would foe traders lined up with a very high price on each ratio.

Let me read to you from Exhibit 32, Page 3, which

is Morgan Stanley’s report on the non-railroad properties.
Here is what they said:
"In essence, however, a sale of interest in the
properties would take place to Great Northern stockholders.

And

on this basis Northern Pacific stockholders should realize sale
value rather than value based on capitalisation of earnings."
Now, the Committee Chairman, frankly testified on his
direct testimony that you can’t make any exact appraisal in
dollars of -these properties.

We claim, however, although it's

not easy to value, some approximate valuation is not only
possible but is necessary if you are going to sustain merger

Now, what was the applicant's evidence in tie record

to support this finding?

He pointed to the TXL, Texaco deal which

Mow, the'important thing for this Court.to realise
is that this body of specific testimony on the part of the
Committee was never rebutted,,

They —- the applicants had

Morgan Stanley? they had all the oil experts and timber experts
on the payroll.

Thousands of our stockholders5 money was paid

to hire them but they didn’t go on the stand and say that Mr.
Williams' price earnings ratio was wrong, or that Mr. Brundage's
testimony as to the various factors that must be considered in
the marketplace, their ratings for natural resources were im­
proper or how to weigh any factors that pertain to these
natural resources.

You just draw a blank from the applicants

in that respect.
So, we say that their testimony is not probative.
It isn’t reliables no experts? nobody to get at the truth.
Mow, the Committee doesn’t claim that the exchange ratios should
be based on exact dollar valuation but it does claim that there
must be.some rational basis in therecord for any alleged just

ratio.

the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and their successors or

3

assigns.

4

This contract which was consummated upon delivery of

its acceptance to President Lincoln December 29, 1854, provided

6

for a method of amendment by Congressional action.

if the terras of the contract are not satisfactory to the

parties, the approach is to amend the contract.

An amendment

10

arid the terms of the contract spall out that Congress has

n

reserved its right to alter or amend or repeal the contract.
And it is submitted, therefore, that under these

12
53

terms the Interstate Commerce Commission has no right to ab­

14

rogate terms of the contract and has no provision to repudiate

IS

any terms by approving a proposed merger which contradicts the

18

terms of the contract.
Now, in summary, Railway officials themselves, have

57
18

recognized — what we are saying here is that Railway, if it

19

did, indeed, take Railroad's mainline right-of-way, it took it

20

It likens the railroads to the players in a game.

But this hasn't been the

rules of the game for nearly half a century.

Act of 1920 established altogether different standards marking
a. fundamental change in the scheme of railroad regulations.
By that legislation, the Commission for the first
time, was empowered to autliori.se and approve the merger of
railroads, not withstanding their anti-competitive effects.
Indeed, that legislation'specifically conferred anti-trust
immunity upon transactions approved by the Commission.

case and so on.
Now, following the X92Q enactment* two acquisitions

of control have reached this Court.

this Court8s attention to idle savings in the New York Central’s

could authorise the one railroad's acquisition of control of

12

consequences was accorded by the Southern Pacific case.

Now, the most dramatic

In 1922, this Court had found that the control of

13
14

the Central Pacific by the Southern Pacific violated the

15

Sherman Act and it ordered divestiture.

16

however, in an effort to maintain control applied to the Commis­

The —• Commissioner Webb had dissented

in the Seaboard Coastline case and of course, he is the author

21

of the Commission's first report and some of his thinking as to

the necessity for preserving railroad competition and certainly

23

his views of the Transportation Act of 1920 of facilitating

24

railroad mergers, that this doctrine does not carry forward into

opposition to the merger.

would have yielded, as the Commission has found on Page 300 of

17

the recordi as the Commission mentioned at 300 of the record,

18

at $5.2 million.

19

specifically that many of the coordinations that were physically

20

feasible would produce grossly unequal benefits to Great

21

Northern and Northern Pacific as separate carriers.

22

competition between the Northern Lines renders a difficult, if

23

not impossible as a practical matter, to curb the expense in­

But the Commission went on to state

It is these benefits, then, that the lessening of

And that

there will be a very substantial lessening of competition has

"undisputed fact,” and as I believe Mr. Justice Black pointed

5

out this morning, it is scarcely possible to conceive of a

significant merger of railroads in an area that would not be

anti-competitive.

8

competitive consequences can be ignored by the Commission.

The Commission refers to this as the

Court*s decision in the McLean and Minneapolis and Seaboard

will result from the proposed consolidation and consider them

Arid the Commission

In our brief we offer many examples.

10

We quote, for

A Montana grain dealer who has elevators near the

11

example;

12

Northern Pacific tracks and he said”for the most part the grain

13

has to move on the railroad pretty close to where it's grown.

14

For instance, I can't ship on the Milwaukee, even if their rate

15

is

16

zero.”
The Commission in the second report indeed

17

recognised that, the northern tier states are rich in animal,

18

mineral, agricultural and forest resources.

19

well that this traffic constitutes, as Mr. McLaren pointed out,

20

approximately SO percent of the traffic originating and by these

21

roads in this area.

22

transportation offers the most distinct competitive advantage,

23

to use his phrase, or the greatest inherent advantages.

vulnerable to motor carrier competition.

And found, moreover, if

9

was this traffic that- the rail carriers must retain to balance

10

their operation in handling the products of -the agricultural

and extracted industries.
The record establishes and the Commission so found-

12
13

that this category of traffic, manufactured in miscellaneous

14

parts, constituted more than 30 percent of the Great Northern’s

•15

carload revenue and nearly 40 percent of the Northern Pacific's.

16

And for both roads is the single most important category of

17

traffic.

18

Now, with respect to the much-quoted Exhibit 16,

19

referred to in the Commission’s second report in the vicinity

20

of Page 316 of the record.

21

well in its second report as it had in its first, that rail

17

these stations contributed about 33 percent of the cars and

38 percent of the revenue of the Northern Lines in this area.

Mr. McLaren would add all these figures, including

20

overhead traffic, and tell you that the railroad merger would

21

result in a loss of competition of 55 percent.

£12

forgot, however, that ‘the addition of the bridge traffic

Northern and Northern Pacific and the other roads serving these
points is not wholly the result of interplay of competitive

forces, but often the result from other factors entirely.

Second:

The shippers at these Class II locations,

competing for traffic.

MR. COX:

Mr, Cox.

May it please the Court, Mr,. Chief Justice,

I appear in this case for the Applicant railroad.

I propose

10

to discuss in the first instance the argument of the Department

11

of Justice and reserve, I hope, a brief period of time at the

12

end of my argument to talk about the arguments of the stock­

13

holders committee and stockholders of Northern Pacific.
I think I shall, unless there are questions from the

Court, submit the appeal o£ the Livingston Anti-'Merger Com­

16

mittee on our brief where it is discussed in considerable

detail.
L-

Q

18

Mr. Cox, would it be a fair or a safe generali­

19

sation to start with in this problem that almost all mergers

20

have an anti-competitive effect to some degree and probably in

21

some degree — not necessarily the same — some savings and

22

benefits.

23

Doesn't that underlie the root ef the problem?
A

That underlies the problem and I suppose that

.24

you could find an economist who would say the more competition

25

you supress the more savings and benefits you get, but it's a

87

s

question of fact in each case,. I suppose and it is our view of

2

the statute that what Congress has done here is to directly

3

authorise the Commission to consider the elimination of compe­

4

tition on the one hand, and the benefits of transportation

5

services and facilities on the other and having made that

6

consideration, to decide on the facts of a particular case and

7

not by the application of some rule of law general application,

8

but to decide on the facts in that particular case whether the

9

merger or preservation of the competition will do more to pro­

10

vide improved, adequate, and economical transportation service

u

which is the standard that we find in the statute.
Now, that is, as wa see it, was the issue here,

12

13

as our view with the Commission in the second report it went

14

to exactly that process, which is the process described in the

15

McLean case in language which is frequently reiterated, that it

IS

weighed the adverse effects on competition against the benefits,

17

improvements in transportation service facilities on the other,

18

and it decided on balance that the merger would do more to

to

11

whether they are, in effect, inviting this Court to 'review the

record de novo and make an independent determination on whether

the Court believes this merger is in the public interest.

14

The argument, it. seems to me, seems to be suspended rather

uneasily between those two extremes.
How, in view of that it was my intention this

18

any way you look at this case, the facts deserve some considera­

19

tion and perhaps more consideration than they get from the

20

argument from the Department of Justice.

21

true, they deal with these facts in a sense, but they deal with

22

them in a rather curious technique, by admitting them they

discount them.

record shows about what this merger means and with the Court's

2

permission I should like to talk a little bit about that* even

3

though, I suppose,- in some certain respects the Assistant
Attorney General will not dispute these facts.

4

How, this is a mass of evidence in this record.

5

There are 14,000 pages of transcript; 240 Exhibits, and the

6

Examiner's Report takes up most of two volumes of this appendix

here.

And a great deal of it is related to the benefits of

this merger to service benefits, the improvement in service and

of this evidence that I would like to say something about.
First, the evidence that has to do with the faster

and more reliable service.
this morning.

Now, that's been mentioned here

The expedited schedules? there are a number of

examples of those 1 could give to the Court.-

It makes some

difference of time of the Yakima Valley of 12 hours to Chicago
and 24 hours to Kansas'City.

From points west of Spokane it

means 24 hours difference to Chicago; intermediate points the
same thing.

Some points of North Dakota and Montana it means

22
24 hours faster to Minneapolis.
23

Now, the whole point that the way the Department, of
24

Justice apparently tries to deal with that is to say, "Well,
25

90

i

the railroads could do this anyway4 without merger»”

2

anticipates the point that 1 intended to deal with a little

3

later, but I will saiy this about that.-

4

this record — not in the record, but there is evidence- which

5

everybody has taken — no question about it, that ufeile this

6

proceeding was pending Milwaukee put on a fast train between

7

Chicago and Seattle and I might that oddly enough, there was

8

also evidence that the reason they did that was because of the

9

fear of truck competition.

This

There is evidence in

Northern Lines responded by putting

10

on fast trains and we were told that that shows that all these

n

improved schedules could be achieved without merger.

12

Now, the fact is, and the Commission referred to this

13

in its second report — really, the third report.

14

13

Mailwaukee and the two northern lines put on between Chicago

16

and Seattle, are light-weight, light-tonnage trains, since they

17

18

more for every kind of freight they carry on those trains.

19

There is one of those trains each way each day except on one

20

of the Northern Lines, which 1 believe was stricken

Mow, in contrast whafc this merger would do would be
to provide faster schedules for the fast trains, but it is going

23

to provide faster schedules for all the trains? the regular

24

freight trains and not only the transcontinental trains, but

25

these intermediate trains.
91

So that the suggestion that

1

light™tonnage trains, light-weight trains that the Commission

2

took into account proved that the carriers can do these

3

schedules without merger, I submit, but not really supported by

4

the rational consideration of the evidence.

5

Hothe other kind of improvement — two other

6 i things that I should like to mention -- one is -the improvement
7

in car supply which this merger will bring which is a very

8

serious matter in this part of the country.

9

will come in two ways:

That improvement

In the first place the improvement in

10

schedules, the elimination of interchanges and the elimination

11

of switching time, turn-around time in the yard is going to make

12

more cars available and there is a reasonably conservative in

13

the record for the Commission that this would mean about 1700

14

additional cars daily which would be available for loading.

IS

Now, that’s one way the ear supply would be improved.

Another vray it would be improved v/hich is of great

16
17

significance, is that when the lines are merged, of course the

18

cars will be centralized? there will be a centralized control

19

for the dispatch and distribution of the cars.

20

evidence of this kind in the record, that these lines will

'Sometimes stand idle on one of the lines while not too far as

22

away the shipper is waiting for the car.

23

one agency distributing those ca.rs over the system that kind of

24

thing certainly will be reduced and maybe eliminated.

Today there is -

Well, when you have

i

25

Mow, the third thing that I should like to mention

92

1

about these service benefits because — so that the Court will

2

get some senseof what's in this record, is a mass of evidence

3

that has to do with the effect of improved through routes and

4

single line service which is often in many cases for some

5

commodities cheaper than even through rates by through rail™

6

roads.

7

which this merger will make available to shippers.

8

evidence proves, and it rather surprised me that these shippers

9

attach great importance to this transit and loading and unload­

20

like a combination rate.

those privileges available to systemwide — they are not now,

22

because the Northern Lines don't extend this kind of privilege

23

to one another — but they will be ®er the entire system, as

24

well as over many parts of Milwaukee, as a result of the con­

ditions.

What they mean, vaguely, is this; that if the

Now, I should now to return to the point in which

things can be done without merger.

13

freight — the expedited scheduled.

14

the.point which is not, 1'think, left entirely clear in the

15

IE've talked about the
I think Mr. Kahn has made

argument this rrtorni% tahfc the Commission did make some

16

findings on this.

They,made the findings that Mr. Kahn referred

17

to and the Examiner made a finding that there was more reason-

18

able expectation that these railroads could achieve these

19

ippr©Vements in service and these coordinations if they remained

20

independent competitors.

21

I think that the findings that the Commission made

22

on that represent one area of agreement between the first and

23

the

24

of the Commission there said: "We agree that these carriers as

25

-second reports because in the first report the.majority

competitors will not — cannot as a practical matter,

94

make

1

coordinations-from which they derive grossly unequal benefits.."

2

And the Commission in the second report found that most of these

3

instances these coordinations or facilities would produce

4

grossly unequal benefits and therefore, as a practical matter

S

it is not reasonable to expect the railroads to make them.
Now# this can be illustrated, and again, to give you

6
7

some flavor of the record, I should like to descend into de­

3

tails that may be a little bit dreary, but 1 think they may be

9

necessary.

10

''
One of the things thatss going to be done in this

11

merger is to coordinate routes, so that the trains in the

12

combined system move over the best and most expeditious route.

13

For example:

14

composed of a segment of the line — the present line of the

15

Northern Pacific from the Twin Cities toa point in North Dakota.

IS

At that point the traffic will move on to what is now the main

17

line of the Great Northern, which is a much batter line, in a

18

respect, and will move on the line of the Great Northern all

19

the way across the top of the country to Sand Point in Idaho.

20

At that point the traffic will be moved over to a line of the

21

Northern Pacific below Spokane and then from Spokane it will

22

move on to the coast over a line of the Great Northern.

23

on the main line west the main route would be

Now, if you stop to think about it, that is the

24

kind of thing -- they are going tobe running common trains —

25

that cannot be done by

95

1

independent competing companies, despite some suggestions this

2

morning to the contrary.

3

compel one railroad to give another railroad traffic rights

4

over its line.

S

would have to have arrangements for compensation worked out,

6

&nd since this is going to be done systemwide on all routes,

7

what you would have to think about would be the two railroads

8

sitting down to decide they were going to run trains over one

0

another1s routes, perhaps mixed trains *

So, if the railroads tried to do this they

10

pay one another was

11

12

The Commission has no authority to

17

Apart from those, you couldndt

do that without ending what was practically a de facto dealing
of revenue and sharing' of *■** and that relationship could hardly
be consistent with really effective and vigorous competition

18

between the two lines.

19

and I would add here that the Commission, in the first report,

20

the report which disapproved the merger, the Coxtimission never

21

found that, coordination of routes between competing railroads

22
23
24
25

So, this coordination of routes --

was ordinarily not practical.

So, here again there is really

no dispute about it.
Now, the coordination of the routes is an essential
part of all these improvements of service.

96

It's obvious that it

I

has a direct relationship to the schedules and the car supply,

2

but it's also essential to the coordination of these terminal

3

facilities and the reason for that is that in order to construci

4

these new terminal facilities you have to rearrange the traffic.

5

You have difficulty getting ground in cities, usually, at the

6

appropriate time and. in most of these cities the two railroads

7
8

8

come into the city from different directionsP as they do, for
example, in St, Paul»

As 1 explained a moment ago, all of that trunk­

line traffic from 8t„ Paul is going to come into St, Paul, the
main traffic east and west over a line of Northern Pacific,
Now, that is also true in some of these other terminals;
Spokane and in Portland, where to do the terminal arrangements
they have to coordinate the routes.

Really, they have to run

mixed trains,
Nov;, that again is not the kind of thing that can be
done — these yards, effectively and efficiently, between two
independent companies.

two companies are operating, they are both — each of them are

as the other does.

You have duplicate yards? duplicate

■y~.

Indeed, there is here, I think, what a* strange
25

97

t

internal inconsistency in the argument of the Anti-Trust

2

Division which 1 think is worth commenting on.

10

14

If you did — could do all of these things by
voluntary coordination between the carriers, what you would
have would be the two carriers running mixed or combined trains
with common crews over-each' other5s routes, using common
terminals and common repair facilities.

To some degree they

would be using managerial staff in common ~ at least they woulc
have to have a common agency distributing the freight cars.
You have a cooperating relationship that would be inconsistent
with the existence of thekind of competition that the AntiTrust Division says should be preserved.

And, indeed, it some­

what surprises me to hear them taking this line inthis case
because in other contexts, they have frequently pointed out the
dangers and .indeed the illegality that would arise from these

15
16

cooperative and joint undertakings, which is exactly what they
seem to be arguing for here.

17
I think that I should now like to speak briefly to
18

the — to one matter and leave it. without much comment, and

19
20

that’s the matter of the savings to the railroads.

I should

merely like to point out to the Court that there is a direct
21

relationship between the improvements in service and savings.

22
Because the savings come in large part — not entirely, but in

23
large part, from the coordination of facilities and from the

24
quicker routes and the other steps that will

25

98

-produce the

1

better service fco the shippers, so that it is a mistake to

2

think of the savings as being of only indirect benefit to the

3

shippers, because they do have a direct relationship to the

4

service improvements.
But, apart from that the Commission made findings

S

6

which all relate to matters that it is entitled to give weight

7

to under Section 5{2), which pointed out that a savings would

8

decrease the pressure for rate increases which come from in­

9

creasing costs but they would, by improving the rafca of return

10

to the carriers, would put them in a better position to buy

n

modern, improved equipment and that they would increase their

12

capacity and power fco compete with the trucks, and other modes

13

of transportation»
Now, the Department of Justice, as I stated at the

14
15
16

17
13
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

beginning, seem to admit that these benefits exist, but it says

that they really are not important as against the loss of
competition that will be caused by the merger of the two
Northern Lines»

tod, I said earlier, their view seems to be

that almost as a matter of law you need something beside
improvement to transportation services and facilities, you need
something over and above and beyond that of a more extraordinary
character»
Q

What would that mean?

A

Well, Mr. Justice Whit®, 1 am not exactly the

man to develop that»

1

Q

1 know, but I'm just trying to imagine the view,

2

A

Well, they give two examples —

3

Q

One of them might be a failing carrier»

4

A

Failing carrier? the other on© is where you

5

have two prosperous carriers that say you need to put them

6

together so that they can..save a third failing carrier like the

7

Mew Haven in the Penn-Central case.

Do you follow me on that?

3

Q

Yes,

Those are the only two examples that they have

given us and have a footnote in their reply brief which to some
degree casts doubt on whether they — whatthey really mean
about the failing carrier, but that's as far as I can go, I
regret to say,
Q

*
I think it's — they would say that if it’s

improved transportation services that we want, the lav? prefers
the competitive way of securing them.
A

That is right.

Q

Mow, while we have developed this legal

argument in our brief and I don't want to retxead what Mr. Kahn
said, but we point out on our brief a number of things about
that argument.

One is that the act itself, almost by term,

shows that Congress is not prepared to rely upon competition to
produce these benefits and we point out specifically that

the

adequacy of transportation service is one of tie four things in
Section 5(2)(c) that the^Commission is required to give weight

25

100

1

to when it is asked to consider a merger.

2

out that the national transportation policy, which of course,

3

pervades to a degree the interpretation of the provisions of the

4

Act, speaks in terms of efficient, economical, adequate and

5

safe transportation service.

6
7

And we also point

Now, it is our view that you can look at the statute
and if you look at the provisions of the statute, the very kinds

3

of benefits that thiscase produces to shippers are the kinds of

9

benefits that the Congress authorized the Commission to con­

10

15

21

22
23
24
25

sider and .if it had a reasonable judgment on thematter in
evidence to support it, could justify a merger -feat suppressed
substantial competition.
And of course, we argue, too, from the McLean case
and the Seaboard case particularly, that they were precisely
cases of that kind.

That's what the Commission did and this

Court sustained it.
Q

I suppose the Government's feeling might be that

•you just developed the sections that shouldn't be ever held to
apply or permit a merger between competing carriers.
A

I don’t think they would go that far, but —

Q

At least when they are strong.

A

Well, I couldn’t honestly say that I could read

their brief that way.

As I say, 1 have some difficulty in

getting into it and analyzing it precisely, but I certainly do
say that you can’t ever have a merger in that situation unless

101

1

you have some very extraordinary benefits that go far beyond

2

improvements in service and the only two I know anything about

3

are the New Haven or the Bankrupt Carrier.

4

Now, Mr. Kahn has discussed the competitive effects

5

of thismerger, particularly with a view to suggesting that the

6

Department has exaggerated fch€; quantitative extent to which

7

competition is affected and I don’t want to cover any of that

8

ground again.

3

There are some things about the competitive situation

10

that I think it might be useful for me to speak of very briefly.

t?

One of them has — they really relate, not so much as to the

12

quantity of the competition that is eliminated, but to the

13

economic condition of that elimination and particularly

14

economic significance in relation to the adequacy, efficiency

15

and economy of transportation service.

18

important to remember here that we — at least in our view, are

17

not operating under a, statute which gives competition as such

IS

in the abstract, some overriding and controlling importance.

19

It is an important consideation and the Commission treated it

20

as beingimporfcant, but it's important as it relates to the

21

contribution it makes to good and improved transportation ser­

22

vices .

23

Because I think it’s

Now, for the economic consequences in that sense to

5

the two Northern Lines and they combine that with the points

6

at which there are the two Northern Lines andone or more —

effect of this merger at those points is quite different.

9

There is a significant difference.

Now, of course the

10

12

significant enough, either in terms of value on the volume of

13

traffic produced, or on the markets they serve to support the

U

arguments on the other side, so they had to combine the 6 per-

16

other railroads in addition to Northern Lines and it’s that way

20

to be the effect of the extent to which you can eliminate com­

21

22
23
24
25

Now, I have said that there is a difference between
the two situations and it's obvious that there is.
question I suppose really is:

The

if you eliminate one of three

or four railroads how economically significant is that in this

103

'i

industry in relation to the.» service and the rates that the

2

shipper will get?

3

tition, but there is nothing in this record thatsuggests in

4

any way that the elimination of one Federal competing railroad

5

in this industry has effects quite as devastating on railroad

s

service and railroad rates as the argument on the other side

7

suggests.

8

that points in a contrary direction.

It is an elimination or reduction of compe­

And there is some pretty hard empirical evidence

9

That is the evidence of the shippers.

10

is a large number of shippers who testified hare and a good

11

many of these shippers came from these points where there would

12

be a reduction by run in the number of railroads serving the

14
15
16
17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

points.

Now, there

Yet, all of these shippers, practically unamous —

all of these shippers, while saying competition is a good
thing, and we like competition, all of them supported this
merger and particularly as its conditions protect the Milwaukee
and Northwes tern.
Now, that evidence seems fco me to indicate pretty
clearly that the shippers, at least, so long as they have two
or more railroads, believe 'that the benefits from this mergar
fco them in their pragmatic judgment,-- the benefits of this
merger to them economically is of more consequence than theeliminating of one railroad out of several at these points.
Now, that is not, of course, a question to be
decided, essentially, by shippers, but certainly, the

104

!

unanimity of support among the shippers is some persuasive

2

evidence that looking at economic consequences, there was

3

nothing unreasonable in the judgment that the Commission made»
I think, since I mentioned the shipper testimony,

I should say one thing more about it because it

shippers were brainwashed by -the railroads, and they also

11

suggest that they are frightened of the railroads»
Well, as to the first suggestion, I merely declare

12

13

that there were more than 200 of these shippers and about 39

14

associations representing shippers that testified.

ware cross-examined; the Examiner accepted their evidence as

credible and persuasive and there is plenty of evidence in this

record that they don * t hesitate tolitigate and to oppose the*

railroads when they want to.

19

the railroads in the first hearing in this case on the question

20

of the Milwaukee conditions.

21

for this suggestion that the railroads brainwashed them.

22

The suggestion we frightened them rests on -a

It was a rather remarkable attempt to

105

i

weapon„ I think.

2

But, I suggest that these witnesses deserve con­

2

sideration and weight has bear given to them by the Examiner and

4

by the Commission.
Now, there are two other things about the economic

5
6

consequences of the elimination of competition that will be

7

eliminated here;, that I think are significant.
One has been referred to, which is the conditions

a
9

of the Milwaukee.

And 1 merely say about that, that, while

10

the Department attempts todiemiss the Milwaukee as a weak and

11

ineffective competitor, again there is ample testimony in this

12

record from the shippers that the Milwaukee has been, even with­

13

out the conditions, an effective competitor.

14

15

evidence that they expect, with the conditions, that it will
an
be/even more effective competitor. And there is no doubt

IS

about, the effect of what those conditions will do with competi­

17

tive power.

18

Northern Lines? it doesn't have as big a volume of traffic? it

19

isn't, as large, but those facts do not mean that a company is

20

an ineffective competitor.

And there is also

It's true it doesn't have as much money as the

21

Indeed, if I may take somewhat the same line I took

22

a moment ago, I have often heard the Anti-Trust Division attach

23

great, importance on the activities of small competitors on the

24

grounds that they make up in hunger, im&ition and enterprise for

25

their lack of 'resources.

106

Well, the Milwaukee here has certainly

t

and

2

will be, I think, on the basis of the facts, an effective

3

competitor.

4

The other thing that 1 would like tax.mention before
