MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Number 270 Brady against

the United States.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY PETER J. ADMJG, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5

MR. ADANG:

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

1

Court:

a

case of Brady against the United States, which is on v/rifc off

9

certiariari in the United STates Court of Appeals for the

lo­

I represent the Petitioner, Robert M. Brady, in the

Tenth Circuit.
This case involves a denial of a motion to vacate

ll
12

sentence made under Title 28, Section 2255 of the United States

13

Code.

14

resolution by this Court.

115

decision of this Court in the case of the United STates against

I believe that this case presents three issues for
These are first: whether the

16

Jackgon will be given retroactive application to prior guilty

17

pleas under the Kidnapping Act; secondly, if the decision is

18

to be given such retroactive application, the question is what j
§

19

test Will be formulated to determine when such guilty pleas-

20

were involuntary prior to that decision.

;

21

22
23
24

25

And, finally, assuming that the Court does make
Jackson retroactive as suggested, and does formulate an
appropriate test, how the facts of the Petitioner’s case fit
within that test.
I would like to depart somewhat from the orthodox

2

I

procedure on oral argument and address myself initially to the

2

first issue which I havementioned, and that is the retro­

3

activity of the Jackson decision.

4

do this if the Court will allow me, is that I feel that this

5

is a question which can and should ba determined as an abstract

6

proposition of law without reference to the facts of this case

7

or any particular case, for tnatmatter.

8

And the reason I'd like to

Also, I would like to say at this time that since

9

wa only received the Government's answer brief last Monday we

?0

were unable to have an opportunity to file a reply brief, and

11

therefore I would like to try to concentrate on attempting to

12

rebut the arguments which appear in the Government's answer

13

brief.

14

The Government has taken a position on retroactivity

IS

which we feel is essentially a negative argument,» which, as

10

a practical matter, would allow very little or possibly no

17

retroactive application of the Jackson decision.

18

ment quite rightly points out in its answer brief that there

19

are apparently two underlying purposes for Jackson: First to

20

prevent the discouragement of guilty pleas ■— or encouragement

21

of guilty pleas and discouragement of the exercise of the right!

22

to a jury trial.

23
24

And secondly, to stop penalising those defendants
who do assert their constitutional rights to a jury trial and
■

25

The Govern­

to plead not guilty.

i

?

Essentially, then* the Government's argument is

2

that you can only apply Jackson retroactively to those cases

3

in which a defendant has pled not guilty and been tried* con­

4

victed and sentenced to death.

5

tion that the first purpose, which we believe is inherent in

6

Jackson, should also be given retroactive application.

7

We, of course* take the posi­

And we have briefed three arguments in support of

8

these contentions, as alternative arguments for retroactive

9

application of the decision to. prior guilty pleas under the

io

Kidnapping Act.

it

The first of'these arguments, we believe, is that

12

it is implicit from the language of the case itself, that it

13

should be given such application retroactively.,

14

held in Jackson that the evil in the selected death penalty

IS

provision, of the Kidnapping Act was that it tended to dis­

16

courage of the right to plead not guilty and deterred exercise

17

of the right to a jury trial.

18

This Court

^

Now, this evil, whi&e it wasn't necessarily coer­

19

cive, was held to be needlessly encouraging of guilty pleas

20

and this, the Court said, had a killing effect upon the exer­

21

cise of constitutional rights? that killing effect being

22

unnecessary, was therefore, excessive.

23

We submit, therefore, that the rationale behind

24

Jackson or the implicit rationale was that if the selected
-

25

death penalty provision had been allowed to remain in the
1
4

1

Kidnapping Act there would have been a potentiality in the

2

future for involuntary guilty pleas and we submit that if that

3

is recognised then there has to ha a recognition of the

4

implicit corollary and that is that guilty pleas prior to

5

Jackson might also have been involuntary. And if that presump­

6

tion is accepted, then 1 feel that Jackson has to be given

?

retroactive application to prior guilty pleas automatically,

&

because this Court has held in the past that involuntary

9

guilty pleas are subject to collateral attack.
Q

10

I realise yours is a Federal case, but in your

11

retroactivity argument do you think that whatever rule is

12

appropriate hare is also appropriate in the application of

13

the actions of the states?
A

14

I feel that it is, Your Honor, assuming that

15

we are talking about a statute with the same kind of a si

IS

selective death penalty provision.

n

is
19

Q

You*re not concerned with that, I recognise,

A

Well, 1 believe that it should be applicable,

but —

20

postulating that if we had the same kind of a statute and the

21

same kind of a selected death provision I would submit that it

22

sheuld be applicable to the states.
|

23
24
23

The Government has made an argument inrebuttal

I

to our contention on retroactivity that when this Court stated j
s
in the Jackson decision that not every defendant who pleads

5

\

guilty under the Kidnapping Act to a capital indictment, does

2

soinvoluntarily.
This Court implicitly rejected any contention that

3
4

prior guilty pleas should he open to collateral attack.

5

feel that that conclusion hardly follows from the language of

3

the case.

We

We feel that all the case says is that the Court is

going to say that the selected(hath penalty provision was

not necessarily coercive, because that would have meant in­
validating all prior guilty pleas automatically.

We submit

that the Court merely was recognising that some guilty pleas
could be involuntary in the future, had the selected death
penalty provision been left in the Act.
And, as I stated before, I think the implicit
corollary is that some guilty pleas in the past could also
have been involuntary.

And for that reason, we submit that

Jackson should be, under the language of the case, applied
retroactively to prior guilty pleas.
Mow, an alternative argument which we have made is
that under the doctrine of absolute retroactive invalidity of
an unconstitutional statute there should also be retroactive
application to prior guilty pleas.

And because of'the time

limitation on this argument and the fact that the Government
hasn’t made ary response to this contention, I am going to skip
over it unless the Court has some questions.
Another argument which we made is, again, an
6
j

1

alternative argument.

2

that is that under prior decisions of this Court on the retro­

3

activity question, Jackson should also be applied retroactively

4

to prior guilty pleas.

5

in our brief in chief on pages 28 to 32 and I am sure they

6

axe more familiar to the Court than they are to me, so I am

7

not going to discuss them in any detail, except to mention

8

that the Court did say in the case of Linkletter against

9

Walker that there are three tests for determining retroactivity

The Court has heard it yesterday, and

These decisions are discussed in detail

prior decisions and that these tests are:
First, the purpose to be served by thenew rule.
i

Secondly, the extent of reliance upon the old rule by law
enforcement authorities and finally, the effect upon the
administration of justice of the retroactive application of the
new decision.
In Desist against the United States, this Court
held that the most important of these considemtiQhg is the
purpose to be served by the new rule and it has bean further
held that when the purpose of the new rule is to assure fair
trials and reliable verdicts.

In other words, to insure

integrity of the fact-finding process, then that consideration
is paramount andother considerations, such as reliance by
law enforcement officials, or an adverse effect upon the ad­
ministration of justice, deserve little consideration.
And we submit thatunder that philosophy, that the
7

I

s.

I

i

Jackson decision must also be given the retroactive effect

2

which we suggest»
The effect of the selective death penalty provision

3

in the Federal Kidnapping Act, in inducing individuals to

S

plead guilty in order to avoid imposition of the death penalty

S

was not merely to denial them a fair trial? but it was to deny

7

them any trial at all.

8

obvious thatthe implicit purpose of Jackson was to ensure fair

9

trials if individuals wanted trials and ensure reliable ver­

10

dicts if they are going to plead guilty.
tod I feel? therefore, that because of this and

11

12

13

And we submit? therefore, that it is

because of the authorities cited? Jackson should be given
retroactive application to prior guilty pleas.
How, the Government has made to arguments in response

14

IS

to this.

16

such retroactive effect, we are probably going to have a

17

18
1©
20
21

22
23
24
25

First the Government has said? "If we give Jackson

substantial adverse effect upon the administration of justice."
But in the

try next breath the government says t "Well ? there

are only about 120 Federal prisoners now in custody under
guilty pleas or bench trials under the Kidnapping Act.

And.

then it further admits that not all of these individuals are
incarcerated under capital indictments.
And? as I will show the Court later, we are only
concerned with capital indictment situations.

So? the number

of individuals that we are dealing with is something less than
3

Even if we add to this number

1

120 under the Kidnapping Act,

2

those, individuals who are incarcerated under the Federal Bank

3

Robbery Act or similar state statutes having select death

4

penalty provisions, we submit to the Court that the number

5

we9re talking about really isn't that great; and even if every

8

one ©£ thass cases were to be reviewed onthe collateral attack

7

we don't feel that there would be a substantial adverse effect

Q

upon the administration of justice; especially, when compared

9

to the potential adverse effect that there would have been had

10

this Court made Miranda or Griffin or Mapp retroactive» Had. one

11

of those decisions been made retroactive the effect would have

12

been that there would be thousands cf prior convictions as

13

opposed to the mere handful of cases we are talking about here»

14

So, we don't feel, for this reason that the argument

15

oi the Government on a substantial adverse effeci is really

16

supported by the facts which the Government cites.

17

In addition to this, the Government has made

IS

another argument and this is that the purpose of Jackson

19

doesn't require that we give it retroactive effect to prior

20

guilty pleas.

previously —-

Q

The Government says, and I pointed this out

Mr. Adang, wouldn't the decision in your favor

on retroactivity have impact far beyond the Kidnapping Act.
A

I don't believe it would, Your Honor.

Well,

the Kidnapping Act and the Federal Bank Robbary Act and state

statutes where we do have select death penalty provisions•

state, but when you start counting up numbers you can't just

4

talk about the Kidnapping Act.
A

6

Well, that is a possibility but I don't think

that the Government has ~

Q

Possibility?

I believe so, Your Honor. A3 I stated -—

Wouldn't it be stronger than that?

to

Well, I don’t know how many cases we*re talk-

u

ing about.

12

effect that we would have had Miranda been made retroactive.
Q

13
14

Certainly 1 don't believe it would be the kind of

But we don’t know, so you can’t just say it’s

120.

i
A

15

Oh, I didn’t say — I didn't mean to imply

16

that, Your Honor; I’m sorry.

But all I’m saying is that the

17

Government’s argument on a substantial adverse effect simply

18

isn’t supported by the facts which they cite in their brief

19

and therefore, we have the nebulous question.
As I was stating, the Government has made a second

20
21

argument on the purpose of Jackson and they state that Jackson

22

should only be applied to those eases in which an individual

23

has pled not guilty and been tried and convicted and sentenced

24

to death..

25

' ^
Q

■

That was the holding in Jackson, wasn't it?
10

1

A

No, ft wasn’t, four Honor, because —

2

Q

The holding in Jackson was that the death

3

penalty provision of the Federal so-called Lindbergh Law was

4

unconstitutional, period.
A

5

Isn’t that true?

I believe that that'is correct.

And I think

S

that while the facts of Jackson were very limited, I think

7

•that because of the holding it encompasses our argument on

S

retroactivity.

9

1 think that the Government*® argument is, as 1

10

pointed out, simply a negative argument because unless the

11

Government has found some magical formula for resurrecting the.

12

dead, 1 don’t think that there would be ve.rv much retroactive

13

application under their theory.

14

the figures on the death penalty convictions, but as I under­

13

stand it, there have only bean six of them under the Federal

IS

Kidnapping Act.

17

people have already been executed.

18

into consideration the possibility that there are soma people

19

now under death penalty sentences under the Bank Robbery Act,

20

which I don01 believe there are, because the only case

21

com© up in the last yeas.* has been Pope against the United

22

States.

23

statutes on death penalty, we’re probably not talking about a

24

very great number of individuals and I think it's really in­

25

finitesimal.

I don't, again, have all of

And I understand also that all of these
Even again, if we take

that has'

And individuals who may be sentenced under state

And I feel, therefore, that essentially the

11

j

i

Government's argument for retroactivity is that there wouldn't

2

be any retroactivity or very little# in any case.

3

Q

Does the rationale you are urging on us have

4

any possibile application to the situation where defendant

S

enters a total plea to, let us say, any lesser offense:

6

manslaughter on a second-degree murder charge, where no death

7

penalty is involved; where he is giving up his jury trial and

8

in order to avoid a heavier penalty,,

9

A

1 don't believe that it does, Your Honor? and

10

if I may, I will address myself to this argument, because the

11

Government has raised it in its answer brief.

12

The Government takes the position that even if we

13

have needless encouragement in this case or in any case we're

14

dealing with of a guilty plea that doesn't equate with in­

15

voluntariness or coercion and therefore, evidence of needless

16

encouragement is irrelevant.

1?

factual support of this, the situations involving multi-count f

18

indictments or several indictments against the same individual j

19

or the lesser degree of the same crime.

20

says that in this situation an individual might very well be

21

encouraged toplead guilty to a lesser degree of crime in orderj

22

to have some counts dropped against him or some indictments

So, the Government cites, in

And the Government

i

dismissed or to get a lesser degree to avoid a harsher penalty]
23
24

2S

Q

Isn't that.the whole idea underlying the

concept of plea negotiations and discussions?

12

1

A

That's correct, Your Honor, I think there is a

2

definite distinction»

1 think that in the plea bargaining

3

situation it is implicit that the penalties which the state can

4

create for the various degress of crime are all valid and

5

eonsitutienal penalties.

6

a crime of first-degree murder and make the death penalty the

7

sentence and create a crime of second-degree murder and make

8

20 years the maximum sentence and in that situation the indi-

9

idual is definitely encouraged to plead guilty to the lesser

In other words, the state can create

10
11

12

13
14
15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But, as I stated, the distinction is that there the
Government or the State can't create the alternatives and
therefore the choice that derives from those alternatives is
not unnecessarily compelling.

In other words, I would submit

that there the encouragement is only incidental to the fact fchal
there was a. choice available:; and that encouragement is not. un­
necessary and it's not excessive, whereas in the death penalty
situation it's inherent in the opinion of Jackson that the fact
that there is a choice available, is itself, unconstitutional.
There the Court was implict in the essence of that
decision that the state cannot create two different penalties
for exactly the same degree-of crimep and impose 'the harsher
penalty only when an individual chooses to assert his constitu­
tional rights.

So, therefore, in that situation, because there

is a choice which is compelled and that choice is unnecessary

13

?

and avoidable the encouragement which results from that choice

2

is also unnecessary and excessive.

3

sufficient to make a guilty plea involuntary.

And yet, I believe it is

4

So, what we end up with is a situation: in the plea

S

bargaining case we have a choice available, but that choice is

0

one which can be imposed by the state? the encouragement which

7

derivas frorathafc choice is, therefore, not unnecessary and not

8

excessive and not illegal.
However, in the Jackson situation or the Kidnapping

9
10

Act situation the fact that there is a choice is in itself

11

unconstitutional and therefore the encouragement which derives

12

from that choice is unnecessary and excessive and can be

!3

avoided in the words of the Government.
So, I don't think that if you were going to make

14
15

Jackson retroactive, as we suggest, that it necessarily going

10

to affect the plea bargaining situations.
Q

17

What about the situation where there is a

IS

bargain — or a plea without bargain for a lesser degree or

19

another cris3 or included offense, just a straight charge and

20
21
22

23

24
25

a plea of guilty in return for a roeosssendation of only a
certain sentence?

Then you are right back in Jackson; aren’t

you, as you. read it?
■■■*•_

A

To some extent, but in that situation it's

obvious that the recommendation is not binding on the Court,
so there is really no guarantee.

14

1

Q

Oh, X know, but the Court accepts it.

2

A

Pardon me?

3

Q

The Court accepts it and what if it weren't

4

acceptable?

5

kept?

What if he pled guilty and the bargain wasn't

i

A

6

:|1
Well, again, 1 don't think that would invali­

7

date the plea, because the,.courts have always held, and in this

8

kind of a situation the recommendation of the United States

9

Attorney or the prosecutor in the case is not binding upon the

10

Court.

II

the. plea was involuntary would be necessarily upheld.

12

So, 1 don't think that in that situation the claim that

Q

But if it were accepted, the court followed the

13

recommendations? the court asked the prosecutor what he recom­

14

mends — perhaps that isn’t good practice, but assume it did,.

15

and the prosecutor made a recommendation and it was taken and

f'6

accepted and it was a plea of guilty.

17

A

Well, again, I think all 1 can say about it is

18

that you get down to a negotiating situation or bargaining

19

situation and we’ve always held that plea bargaining is not

20

itself invalid.

21

provision, that’s there in the statute and it, itself, creates

22

a compulsion.

23

Whereas, in the situation of the death penalty

Another analogy might be the situation where a judge

24

on arraignment says to the defendants !SIf you plead guilty

25

we’re going to give you 20 years imprisonment; if you plead not

15

1

guilty and are convicted, Is in going to give you 50 years im­

2

prisonment. " And I think in that situation it's fairly obvious

3

that the guilty plea, if one results, is invalidated? it is

4

involuntary„

S

And 1 think our situation here, instead of the judge

6

saying that, the statote says its

7

maximum penalty is the death penalty; whereas if you plead

8

guilty the most you can get is life imprisonment.

9
10

To plead not guilty the

Well, 1 feel that that is a more consistent analogy
with the situation and it does support our argument.
I was going to say previously, that, in addition the

11

12

Government's theory, if one thinks about it, would be to punish

13

tine potentially innocent individual and reward the guilt • indi­

14

vidual

15

reward those people that' were tried and convicted and sen sncod

16

to the death penalty by reducing their sentences, but let's not

17

go into prior guilty pleas on collateral attack and thereby, I

10

think we would potentially punish individuals who might be

19

innocent or who might be incarcerated because of a clear viola­

20

tion of their constitutional rights.

21

22
23

In other words,- the Government would say, "Let’s

So, I 'think for all of these reasons Jackson should
be be given the retroactive application which we request.
Now, with that, assuming that the Court does adopt

24

that argument, I'd like to give a brief statement of the facts

25

of this case to present the framework for the remaining arguments

which we have in our brief.

20

detailed? but I believe that the Government has admitted in its

21

answer brief that Brady was undoubtedly encouraged andmofcivafced

22

to plead guilty by fear of the death penalty and his desire to

23

avoid the inquisition of that penalty.

24

After allof the evidence was in the District Court

it implicitly held that because the statute was constitutional

Brady's claim that fear of the death penalty coerced him was

4

without any merit.

5

And I feel that

On April 8th of last year this Court handed down the

decision in the Jackson case and the denial of Brady's motion

7

was appealed. '

8

affirmed the decision.

And the Tenth Circuit on December 17, 1963

decision in the Jackson case should be applied retroactively

to the guilty pleas but it . want on to state that the existence

of the proscribed provision did not necessarily imply that all

15

conclusion that Brady's guilty plea 'was influenced and en­

16

couraged by factors other than the death penalty provision.

17

It held that — that was supported by substantial evidence.

And therefore, it affirmed the District Court's

In the second point in our brief in chief we have

18

19

proposed a test to be utilised by District Courts in deter- ...

20

mining when prior guilty pleas are involuntary.

21

stated before, we’re only concerned here with cases where the

22

death penalty was a reasonable possibility and that would be

23

only those cases where there was a capital indictment.

24

that sjquisite is satisfied, the nest question is ; what kind

2S

of evidence will be necessary to show that a guilty plea is

'

18

Once

1
2

involuntary.
And I submit that the only practical and reasonable

3

test that can be formulated is a simple test and rather un­

4

defined and that is that if the District Court can find from

w»

the evidence that fear of the death penalty and the desire to

6

avoid the imposition of that penalty was a definite factor; a

7

substantial factor in motivating the guilty plea, then that

Q

should be sufficient to invalidate the guilty plea.

9
10
11

Q

Would there always be a definite factor?

How

could it not be?
A

Well, I think that you can probably postulate

12

situations, Your Honor, where it wouldn't be.

13

I think maybe in the situation where an individual was indicted

f4

under the Kidnapping Act and also was indicted under a state

15

charge of first degree murder you might conceivably, very well,

15

plead guilty to the kidnapping charge to have the state charge

17

against him dropped and you might not even consider the possi­

18

bility of the imposition of the death penalty under the kid­

19

napping act.

20

For example,

But, really, that kind of argumentation doesn't

21

land anything to the question; it kind of obfuscates the issue.

22

I think that there certainly can be cases where an individual

23
24
25

would plead guilty, not out of fear of the death penalty, but
out of a motivation — a genuine sense of guilt.

Thf> practice.!

question is that in every one of these cases an individual is
19

1

going to claim that he was afraid of the death penalty and you

2

get involved in an evidentiary problem and the question iss

3

how do you resolve that?
Anci 1 think that the only way to do that is to give

4
5

tbe District Courts this general test and let them gc from

6

there; because 1 think as a practical matter,, the District

7

Courts aren't going to believe the testimony in every case of

8

the defendant himselff that he was afraid of the death penalty.

9

2 think they are going to require that there be some more

10

independent, objective evidence of the influence of the death

ii

penalty»
And I think that this kind of evidence could come

12
13

from the lawyers who

14

witnesses who were involved at the time who would have less of

15

a motivation to fabricate a story 'chan the accused himself.
Q

,

If there is,, a complete implementation of Rule

17

II and the judge who takes the plea and makes an inquiry which

18

develops all the factsf which cumulatively would make for guilt,

19

would 3fou then say that that satisfies the test that you have

20

advanced?

2!
22

A

That’s postulating leaving the selective death

penalty in, 1 suppose and 1 would say no it would not.

I think that question has already been dealt with in Jackson.

And whether there is a factual basis for the

A

Well, yes, that’s true.

X stand corrected on

that.

That is the basis of it, to determine whether there is a

12

factual basis and whether there — but the factual basis is a
13

practical matter as determined by the defendant standing there
14

and saying, "Yes, I did it," which is his guilty plea.

In

15

other words ~
16

Q

Well, if the District Judge — if the trial

17

judge is doing his task the way it should be done, he will not
18

accept that.

He will ask the man to recite what he did and

19

develop on the record the full statement of all the facts
20

a summary of the facts that would be in the case against him.
21

A

All right, adopting the Court’s line of

22
reasoning, assuming there is some factual basis for the plea,
23

that still does not necessarily rule out that here the death
24

penalty would motivate and encourage that guilty plea.

In other words, a factual basis does not necessarily
mean that the man is, in fact, guilty.

that you can't have a guilty plea in these circumstances.

I would say that is correct.

It

I see that my time is rapidly coming to a close and

12

I would just like to summarise our last point briefly and that

is that it is clear on the record that Brady’s guilty plea was

encouraged andmotivated by fear of. the death penalty and that

it was a substantial factor in his plea.

to this; other witnesses testified to this and there was

17

evidence on the statements made by the Court to him at the time

of his plea and at the time of all of these proceedings.

the Government had admitted that there was encouragement of his

20

guilty plea.

His lawyers testified

And

And I feel, therefore, that because of this evidence
Brady’s guilty plea should be vacated and his motion to vacate
sentence should be granted.
The Government's argument is that even if we show
encouragement of a guilty plea under our test that wouldn't be

enough to invalidate a guilty plea, because it woul&ns t fee

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH J. CONNOLLY,

16

ASSISTANT TO THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ON
BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

17

MR. CONNOLLY;

18

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

19

the Court;

Post-conviction hearing in this case disclosed the

20

following facts which should be emphasized:

w

Petitioner wass 24 years old when he pleaded guilty

21

22

to the charge of kidnapping a young woman.

23

charge and of the Government's case is that Petitioner and his

24

co-defendant, raped their victim several times during the

25

abduction.

24

An element of the

Petitioner was represented by competent and ex­
perienced counsel.

After thoroughly investigating the case,

Counsel concluded; "That we just couldn't go to a jury? it
would be almost sure conviction."
Petitioner's co-defendant, Tafoya, had given a
confession which fully implicated the Petitioner.

Therafter

Tafoya decided to plead guilty and seek leniency from the Court
onthe ground that the Petitioner was the instigator and prin­
cipal actor in the crime.
Faced with the testimony of his victim and other

10
11

witnesses and including, possibly, his co-defendant, Petitioner

12

with the concurrence of his counsel, entered a plea of guilty.
Petitioner now contends that his conviction must

14

17

be set ae'lde on the authority of the United States versus
Jackson.

tary in the traditional sense, which I will discuss in a few
minutes.
Rather, his argument rests entirely on the Court's

18

19
20

finding in Jackson that the death penalty provision needlessly
encouraged guilty pleas and jury waivers.
We must assume that such encouragement wets present-

21

22
23
24
25

He does not cirgus that his guilty plea was involun­

in this case, but the issue here is whether the needless
encouragement so far undermines the validity of the guilty plea
that Petitioner is thereby entitled to release on habeas
corpus.
25

The function of the writ of habeus corpus as the

Court said in Faye versus Moya, is to provide a prompt and

6

We submit fchatit is not.

7

In our brief we consider two theories under which

8

the validity of the guilty plea might be affected by the

9

needless encouragement rationale of Jackson.
The first theory which I will discuss in more detail

10
11

here is that Jackson announced a new standard to be applied in

12

determining the voluntariness of a guilty plea.

13

approach taken by the Fourth Circuit in the Alford case,, which

14

was argued yesterday.

This is the

The second theory-' is unrelated to the concept of

15

voluntariness.

16

The elements of this theory ares {1} that

Jackson established, in essence, a right to be free from

17

needless encouragement and (2) that this right should be applied

18

retroactively so other defendants who had previously pleaded

19

guilty are entitled to automatic release on habeus corpus.

20

We turn to the involuntariness theory.

21

It is our

submission that the determination of the voluntariness of the

22
23

guilty plea to a kidnapping indictment is not a££<&tted by the

-

24

25

decision in Jackson.

Even before Jackson was discarded a

defendant's extreme fear of the death sentence after trial, who
26

?

had been shown to establish the involuntariness of his guilty

2

plea .

The fact that the statute created a needless en­

o

couragement added nothing to its coercive effect.

14

an understanding of the policy considerations which underlie

15

the rule.

16

The first of these considerations is the overridng

17

purpose of all our rules of criminal procedure to ensure the

18

reliability of criminal convictions.

19

that are the product of compulsive pressures because of our

20
21

22

We reject guilty pleas

concern that suchpressure may have caused the conviction of one
who is not, in fact, guilty of a crime to which he pleaded.
The second consideration which underlies the require­

23

ment of voluntariness is our concern for preserving the dignity

24

and integrity of the individual in the criminal process.

25

is the fundamental principle enforced through the Fifth

27

This

2

It is inconsistent with our adversary system of justices,

3

to subject the individual to compelling pressures which over­

4

come his determination to make the state prove its case against

5

him.

6

With these considerations in mind we think that a

7

fear of the death penalty which overcomes the defendant's

8

capacity to make a free and rational decision? renders his

9

guilt}/ plea involuntary.

i

Such a defendant who pleads guilty

10

in a manner which precludes the death penalty is entitled to

11

relief even if the death penalty provisions are entirely con­

12

10

was a needless or ’unnecessary burden on his right to a jury

the necessity or the validity of the provision.

The fact that

the death penalty provision was subsequently declared invalid
gives no additional reason to conclude that Petitioner’s will
was overborne.

It gives no reason to believe that Petitioner

was not, in fact, guilty of the charge.
The needlessness of the encouragement, we submit,
is not relevant to the question whether that encouragement
produced an involuntary guilty plea.
Q

Row, what you are saying, I gather, in your

argument is, leaving out the question of retroactivity, that
the Jackson decision has' no impact at all upon what the issue
29

1

is in determining whether a plea of guilty is coerced or not

2

coerced„

3

A

4

I will leave to our brief the discussion of the

5

S

alternative theory on which petitioner might be entitled to
relief on the basis of Jackson,,
\
Under that theory Jackson would be viewed as

7

8
9
10

11
12

13

creating a new constitutional right to unencumbered choice.
The choice of plea or mode of trial free from needless en­
couragement.

16
17
10
19
20
21

22
23

If this right is given retroactive application

then Petitioner and all other defendants who pleaded guilty
under the Kidnapping Act are entitled to their immediate
release.
Although we doubt that the Jackson decision was

14
15

That's right, Mr» Justice.

intended to create such a right, we analyze this theory in our
brief and we conclude that retroactive application of such a
right is not appropriate because the purposes of the rule do
not cast doubt on the accuracy or integrity of prior convic­
tions .
Petitioner's argument that the principle of Jackson
was that there was a possibility that there would be involuntarpleas in the future and hence, a possibility that there were
involuntary pleas under the Kidnapping Act prior to the invali­
dation of the death penalty provision is fully answered, as it

24

was in Duncan versus New Jersey by the fact that such
25
30

1

defendants had available to them the vehicle to show their

2

involuntariness of their guilty plea.
Finally, it may be argued that our inquiry had been

3
4

too limited and that it is difficult to believe that the

5

Jackson decision had no effect whatsoever on previous guilty

6

pleas.

7

tried to explore other possible theories on which Jackson would

8

affect past convictions.

presented by the three individuals in these cases argued yes­

In preparation of our brief and our argument we' have

Indeed, three different theories are

terday and today.

11

theories, is that the Jackson opinion, if it is to be applied

12

13

to previous convictions at all, gives no indication as to which
defendant should and should not benefit from it.

1?
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

But the difficulty in selecting any of these

thus so uncertain we believe that the appropriate course is
to decline to release serious offenders without a showing of
the involuntariness of the guilty plea under established
standards.
For these reasons we submit that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals can be affirmed.
