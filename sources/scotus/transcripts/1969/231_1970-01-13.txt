MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Longshoremen against the Ariadne Shipping Company.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

No.'231, International

MR. WALDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court, this; case brings up for review an order of the District

9

Court of Appeals for the State of Florida which affirms a

10

permanent injunction against picketing.

•II

the kind that is generally known as area standards picketing

12

by which we mean that a union which does not necessarily

13

represent the employees in a particular establishment, and in

14

this.case the union did not, but which does represent employees

15

engaged in the same work in other establishments in the area,

18

pickets to publicize the failure of the employer to meet the

17

wage standards or other employment conditions under which his

18

own employees are being employed.

19

C!

The picketing was of

Does that claim depend upon whether this record

20

does or does not show the pairticipation in longshoremen work

21

by American nationals not part of the ship’s crew?

22

A

We take the position, your Honor, that the

,23

record is cuifce clear, and there is no evidence to the contrary

24

that there was participation by American nationals not part of

25

the ship’s crew.

We take the alternative position that had the

3

jj

i

!

facts been otherwise, and had the record been quite different.

Z

from what it is, and had the record disclosed, which it did

<9

w*

not, that all of the longshore work, but admittedly longshore

4

work, was performed by members of the ship's crew, then the

3

National Labor Relations Board would still have exclusive

jurisdiction, and this Court*3 cases, as I shall develop later.

7

dealing solely with shipboard relations, labor relations between

8

the crew, acting qua crew, and the vessel have no applicability-

to longshore work and do not withdraw jurisdiction from the

In other words, a foreign flag ship cannot

14

bring its own longshoremen as part of the ship's company and

That is correct, your Honor.

It is no

We have no question, and that is what we urge

upon this court, that in that situation that operation would

be subject to the federal labor laws, as well as other federal

regulatory laws, and we are in effect no different.

Your Honor, again I have got to distinguish

between what the record shows and what they contend.
have to make an alternative contention.

Again I

I have to say that

on the basis of this record that point does not arise, but
were the record to be otherwise, we would still take sharp
issue with them.

First, the record does show, and it is the

only testimony in the record that there was loading of cargo,
automobiles, et cetera.

They claim the contrary.

There is no

evidence to that effect in the record,
Second of all, however, they admit that there was
5

I

the loading and unloading of baggage, and there was the

2

loading aboard of ship’s stores.

3

work, such as handling of lines that is traditionally longshore;

4

work.
-

5

this is work that the National Labor Relations Board has

6

already traditionally and as a matter of its rulings held to

7

be longshore work.

8

industrial practice that prevails in this country.

cited, for example, the NLRB certification of the longshore

There is actually other

We pointed out, particularly in our reply brief, that

unit in the Port of New York, which is of course by far the

n

largest port in the nation, and that certification in express

12

terms applies to the loading of cargo, including baggage and

13

ship's stores.

14

the Board assumed jurisdiction over a jurisdictional dispute

15

under Section 10(k) involving expressly the handling of

16

passenger baggage aboard a foreign crew ship,

25

We have cited a case on the West Coast in which

again.on the

basis of industrial practice where this is longshore work and
is historically longshore work, awarded this work to the
employees represented by the Longshoremen’s Union

on the West

Coast.
()

You say line handling.

Line handling is

traditionally longshore work?
h

Yes, sir.

Q

That just could not physically have been done

by members of the crew because they could not get back aboard.
6

i

1.

1

Certainly as a ship is coming in, unless they

z

are going to jump ashore before the lines are passed ashore,

3

that has to be shore based employees' work, and is, and was

4

performed here.

5

It was performed by shore based terminal labor.

6

there is another record in another case which so indicates on

7

these vessels.

a

as they say, they are still wrong, but the facts are not as

§

they say.

1 think this is actually where they are wrong.
Actually

That is why we say, yes, granted the facts

We would say, your Honor, that if there is any real

10

issue as to whether or not this work was admittedly performed

II

as longshore work, that is for the Labor Board todetermine,

i

12

just as the Labor Board must determine threshold jurisdictional

13

questions, such as the status of employees as supervisors or

14
13
m
n
18
13

j

’’employees' within the meaning of the Act, whether an
organization is a labor organization within the meaning of the
Act.

Otherwise, you have opened up the possibility of a state

court, perhaps a hostile state court fashioning its findings
in such a way as to exclude from the National Labor Relations
I
Board that jurisdiction which Congress intended it to have.

20
o

The rnei-e claim, however, does not taka

21
jurisdiction away from the courts, does it?

That would violate!

22
everything that the Incres case and its companions stand for,

j

23
which is tliat the Labor Board does not have any jurisdiction
24
whatever over the seagoing crew of foreign flag ships, so far

j

23
as they are the crew of the ships.
7

The mere claim that they
l

«*ft

are doing some sort of

2

work that somewhere in the United

States is cone by somebody else except for the crews of ships

does not tike all of the jurisdiction away from the courts,. I

work there, and that has created a jurisdictional dispute, a

12

labor dispute, because this is traditionally Teamster work

under the Teamster's contract for that vary establishment, and

14

there is a dispute that arises.

15

have to say, your Honor, that I would think that would be for

18

the Labor board to determine in the first instance.

1?

you can get frivolous claims, but I do not read the Court's

18

decisions in Inores and Soeiedad Nacional to say that when

19

there rs a dispute about the nature of the work, whether it is

20

seamen's work or otherwise, that is a dispute to be determined ;

the union's right under the 1st and 14th Amendments to
publicize its disputes.

These issues were argued throughout.

After a temporary restraining order was issued on
the basis of the fact that this was work performed for a
foreign flag vessel, and after the trial court in the hearing
ruled that there was no abridgement of free speech because
this was violative of Florida law, albeit there was no

20
evidence or claim of violence or obstructionism, no attribution
21

in evidence or in the record at all of any particular objective

22
to the union's picketing, let alone any legal objective; no
23
indication by the Court as to what state rule of lav;,
24
statutory or judge-made, was violated by the objective or type
25

of picketing involved, merely the naked assertion that this

was in violation of state law, on the basis of this the Court

.There are provisions of the

We would also challenge the

Cn the preemption point, it is our contention
12

1

2
3
4

5

essentially that the considerations which led to this Court's
decision in the Seamen's cases have no bearing here.

In those

casee, this Court was persuaded by not the possibility of a
conflict w:;.th foreign law, foreign regulations, international
treaties to which this nation was a party, but the inevitabilit

6

of such conflict.

The relations between seamen and the ship

*3?A

necessarily continue wherever the ship goes throughout the

8

high seas, and at any port of call, including ports in the

a.

United States and ports in the nation of registry.

There can

?o

in the nature of the case be only a single set of laws

ii

governing this unitary relationship, a single union representing

12

the crew — you can't have separate unions depending on which

13

port the ship is in at any one moment -- et cetera, and for

14.

these reasons there has developed the law of the flag and the

15

principle generally that as a pragmatic expedient that there

16

being one law that must predominate, the law of the flag will

17

be that lav/.

IS

invoked in the Seamen's cases in saying that although the

19

language of the national Labor Relations Act may be sufficiently

20

broad to cover this type of dispute, absent any clearer

21

expression of Congressional intent, the Court would not assume

22

that Congress intended to vary so the general relations among

23

the nations.

24
25

It was this principle in effect that the Court

Now, this just does not apply at all when there is
a longshore dispute, even if exclusively the ship's crew were
13

1

2
3
4
E

involved in performing the work.
Q

Let me get it straight,

I thought you said

a moment aco that this picketing, as far as the record shows
on the evidence, was directed at both the ship's crew and third:
party longshoremen work,; both.

HP

®

7

A

That is correct.

C

Then you don't agree, Mr. Waldman, or maybe I

a

misread yov, with Footnote 6 in the Government's brief?

oH*

Government's brief says, "Hera, American longshoremen were

10

11
12,

The

locally hired to do the longshore work, and the Union was
seeking to carry its dispute to them."
A

That is correct partially.

We were objecting

13

to whoever was performing the longshore work, and on this

U

record it was two classes of people.

15

indicates that we were only or might have only been objecting

16

to the work —

17

Q

Insofar as this footnote ;

You have probably already answered this, Mr.

18

Waldman, but let me ask it again.

Even if the ship's crew

W

v/ere the oily ones doing this longshore work, you would still

20

be here, would you not?

21

h

Absolutely.

22

Q

All right.

23

o

Let us assume you are wrong on that, and it

24

was only the ship's crew, there is no preemption under Xncres

25

in those cases.

Assume that that is the law.
14

Then what would

!

be the result if both the ship's crew and third parties are

2

being picketed?

3

A

Then it should go to the National Labor
v

4

Relations hoard to- determine how the combined set of facts

5

and the considerations that apply to the combined set of facts

6

yield a result consonant with the terms of the Act and this

7

Court's decisions.

S

s

Well, Mr» Waldman, to that extent, then, you

Q

do acres with this sentence in Footnote 6 of the Government's

I
:
i
-

10

brief? "Were there any risks of improperly involving the ship5 s

11

crew, that could be accomodated in the first instance by the

12

Board in any proceedings before it."

13
14

A

Mr. Justice White has in his question assumed

I was wrong on my primary legal thesis.

13

Q

I am., too, but I am talking about this mixture.

m

A

If I make that same assumption, and the reason

17

f

I have toagree

IS

Q

19

A

•

is I didn't know whether that assumption
With that assumption,

but a mixture.

With that assumption,

I would agree with

20

Footnote 6»Without

that assumption,

and on my argument as it j

21

is, I disagree with Footnote 6 of the Board's brief.

22

the Board was burned a little too much in lucres and is

23

withdrawing more than it should.

24

should be a balancing of contacts in longshore disputes any

25

more than the Court fait contrary to fhe position expressed

Perhaps

\

I would not say that this

that a balancing of contacts to some extent should apply in
the Seamen's case,

are going to talk of that , should be performed by this Court
as it did in the Seamen’s case, but with the opposite result.
We say the Labor Board does have jurisdiction.

3

11

I think the balancing of contacts, if we

We would be

1

here complaining if they declined jurisdiction,, whether the
work were performed by the ship's crew or by a mixed group.
This work has no extraterritorial consequences.

The Board's

assumption of jurisdiction applies totally within American
territories.

There is no indication in this record or in any

12

brief that any foreign nation has sought to regulate purely

13

longshore labor disputes in ports of another country.

34

would be contrary not only to the international law, the law

13

• ‘

of the flag, and its converse, the law of territorial
jurisdiction; it. is contrary to industrial reality throughout
the world, because, and we emphasise this in our brief, the
longshoreman is not a uniquely American industrial creation.

J9

We have not cut out or excised a portion of the normal

20

seaman’s trade and given it to some other group of people.

21

The longshoremen and the seamen are functionally and

22

individually diverse in every country of the world, in every

23

major port of the world, so far as I know.

24

international conventions, international labor enactments,

25

which apply to the work of a longshoreman, the loading and
16

We have cited

unloading of cargo.

We cited domestic laws to the same effect.

■

We are dealing here with an American situation which

2

parallels the international situation, and in other countries
i)
as well, they expect to and do regulate their longshore labor
VSi

disputes under their own laws, no matter who is performing the
work.

That is precisely what we say should apply here.
:

i

»

Hay I just raise one other point in connection with

8

the record!? This relates primarily to something Mr. Justice

9

White mentioned.

i

In terms of the state of the record, I do

10

want to emphasize what we pointed out in our briefs-, that the

tt

on what the result should be with respect to a ship’s crew

J.

I would think , your Honor, there should still

be a reversal on the grounds that this record shows without

contradiction that this work was being performed at least in

part by American residents hired locally, in which case we

would urge that Footnote 6 of the Government brief correctly

sets forth the result, namely, that the NLRB still has

jurisdiction in the first instance to consider that.

This is

1!

not a case where the record facts are in contradiction.

12

are very clear as to what they show.

a good many days before the respondent’s brief, and the

20

going to iruike in its brief about that.

■

That is correct, your Honor.

21

h

22

1 just want to emphasise what I said earlier.

If one;

23

were to immunize the work performed by the ship’s crew from

24

Labor Board jurisdiction when that work is not seamen’s work,

25

:
when that work is performed within American territorial confines:

18

i

1

exclusively, when that work is performed on shore,, then I

2

think a Pandora's Bex has been opened.

3

foreign flag vessels are traditionally paid well below

4

American standards.

3

American standards, and there would be no problem at all in

The ship's crew of

to do not only the loading and unloading of the ship,, but to

8

do the loading and unloading of the trucks bringing in cargo,

0

or taking cargo away, to do ship repair work in drydock, and

10

as I say, even to go inland and pick up supplies.

11

least, it would be unthinkable that given a statute which is

12

expressly designed to eliminate or minimize disruptive

13

industrial disputes, and to secure uniformity, that the

14

National Board would be powerless to step info the kind of

15

labor disputes that would inevitably ensue in that kind of

16

a situation.

To me, at

point, this; Court . has held that in applying the constitutional !

Mr. Justice Stewart, according to the rules, that it is still
before the Court, even if net put in the appendix,

I

I believe

it is Rule 17.
C:

It is lodged with the Court, and I have not

got the rules before me, but as I have them in mind and
recollect them, those rules make it incumbent upon the parties
to put into this printed appendix such parts of the record that.;
|
the parties want to bring before the Court.
i,

Respectfully, your Honor, 1 checked that rule,

i

because I saw this was not here, and the Rule 17, on page 15
of the Supreme Court Rules, says that everything in the record
is before this Court.

But that is why I want to tell you what

the facts are, because this has been found three times as to
this no cargo, no cars, and therefore no longshoring.
Q

In doing so, you may represent properly only

matters which are in the record itself,
h

Surely, your Honor,

That is why I put the

record pages 53 and 54, which are pages 28 and 29 of the
original transcript, which I happen to fcs reading from, and
unfortunately not in the appendix.

12

That is the point we are trying to make,because Mr.

Gopman, the union attorney, knew this very well, because this

14

is on this record on the 16th of August 1966.

15

this case started with our injunction in May of 1966.

There is

no doubt about that.

But that is why I am pointing out on

2

these three different occasions, not only this time, but three ]

3

days before this Court in Eastern, and that is why 1put that

4

in my brief, because it was laid out so clearly there, in

3

there when Mr. Gopman asked the question about cargo, he was

8

told by this same man, again under oath, no cargo at all.

Mr. Gopman asked "No cargo at all?"

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SEYMOUR M, WALDMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

V.R. WALDMAN:

I can't say too much in a minute, but

may I just make these brief points.

Mr. Leslie’s memory

in the

Eastern case, not in this case, and I don’t think it is
properly before the Court, but it is there: on pages 12 and 13
of that deposition.

Mr. Kane said the handling of lines is

done by she reside employees, not by ship's crew, by a shore
gang.

That is in the record of the Eastern case.

Kane deposition baffles me.

But this

This is a deposition taken in a

lawyer’s oifice in another case that apparently somehow is
filed in this case.

I can’t, see the slightest procedure!

way that it, ever came to the attention of the Court in this
case.

I see no reference to it: in any motion, proceeding,

order, statement by the Court, or by counsel.
the judge v as ever aware of it.

I don’t think

I don’t see how any counsel

can argue to a court, let alone the Supreme Court, that facts
are established by a deposition taken in another case by a
lawyer in Ms office that never comes to the attention of the
Court.
