ARGUMENT OF REBER R„ BOULT, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. BOULT;

8

Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Associate Justices,

this case concerns a college student, not a school child, a
9
10

college student, who was dismissed from the state university for
handing out one leaflet on the campus not in or about any class­

It
room.
12

The issues break down into four.

The regulations

13

involved prohibit disrespect for authority and any other conduct
14

requiring severe discipline.

We contend that these are void for

15

vagueness and overbreadth.

Primarily a first amendment conten­

16

tion the fourteenth amendment due process notice is also sub­
17

sumed in the question.
18

Nextrve contend simply that they are void as applied that

you cannot outlaw the distribution of literature or more specifi2

to this case put somebody out of school for it.

As I understand this record, there were six stu­

22

dents who were dismissed?

Three in this package, Your Honor.

What happened to the other two?

of the four issues were identical to all three petitioners.

If we agree with you that his distribution was

You do not have to. Your Honor.
For example,

I am -thinking particularly of the issue on your

15

point of vagueness of the regulations whether we have to reach

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

I would suggest

13

that in the way first amendment litigation is going nowadays,

so many Dombrowski - type actions that the first point of reference:

if more often the facial unconstitutionality rather than the

Is the leaflet that he was charged with distribut­

ing in the record, is it?
'A

Yes, it is Flaintiss*s Ehixib.it 6 which appears

appears at page 175 of the record.

2

The other two issues invovled are due process issues,

one having to do with the composition of the panel and its

conduct, the Faculty Advisory Committee, that is the University's

disciplinary committee, its confusion of functions being essen­

the hearing.

never had a chance to rebut this.

One other witness testified that she saw him hand it out in the

21

cafeteria.

two, three or four months before the leaflet was prepared.

24

dent of the University.

Q

This Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 is supposed to be on

5

page 175 of the Appendix here, but this pagination is a bit con­

6

fusing to me at least.

?

A

The confusion on the pagination, I believe, Your

8

Honor, comes from the inclusion in the Appendix of the Student

9

Handbook which runs from 177 to 178 but takes some-70 odd pages

10

to do it.
Q

11
12

Yes, I see.

I think I now have this.

It is on

page 175 marked in the upper right-hand corner.

Upper right-hand corner, yes, in the Appendix.

Q

Getting in the early years of the Civil Rights

16

A

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

A

Also, at the disciplinary hearing, there was no

Movement?

evidence presented whatsoever of disruption of the campus, immi­
nent

disruption, proposed disruption, suspicion to disruption.;

possible disruption, none.

It was just not commented upon.

At the hearing in the District Court, th.ere w

no

23

evidence of actual disruption.

The only evidence of possible

24

or prospective disruption was the President of the University8sf

25

1 can only use the phrase, vague and undifferentiated
5

fears as

1

2

in Tinker.

He referred to it as inflammatory, it gets students

all stirred up thinking about other things.

3

There w.as one other bit of testimony on that.

The

4

Dean of Students objected that the students received the leaf­

5

let as they were walking across the campus and would stop and

6

read it.

7

The disciplinary action was not taken until at least

8

one month after the leaflet was handed out so that this is not

9

a case where we really need to rely on forecasts.

10

The idea on the first issue of whether the void for

II

vagueness doctrine should apply on the campus, I believe, is

n

amply covered in the brief.

13

just seems inconceivable that it shouldn't.

14

I will only mention here that it

It seems much more reasonable to me to apply it there

15

where you have got people thinking about things, erudite,

16

scholarly, literary, talented, to write rules than in the small

17

towns that are held so rigidly to first-amendment standards as

13

specificity in drafting their ordinances.

13

As to what the standard might be, I think the same

20

approach as was taker, in Dombrowski v. Pfister, Dombrowski

21

referred to the loyalty oath cases as setting forth an appro­

22

priate standard for other contexts.

23

of a different context, though, because it is still on a campus,

24

at least not much of a different context.

25

Q

This is really not much

But aren't these regulations in a different
6

1

category, they are provided for an institution of learning.

z

These don’t have the status of the law, statute or city ordi­

3

nance .
A

4

They have considerably greater effect on those

3

who must live by them than say a disorderly conduct statute

6

which -----

7

Q

But on the other hand, the people who were doing

8

the drafting, at least at the time and in the context in which

9

they were originally drafting,were probably proceeding on the

10

assumption that these students were coming to these institutions

11

to study and to learn and they perhaps did not give them the

12

kind of detailed attention they would give them if they were

13

writing them today.

14

A

Your Honor, I would hope they would give them,

15

more detailed attention if they were rewriting them today.

16

I hope, will be one result of this case.

17

The regulations were revised every year, though.

This,

They

18

were quite current at the time, 1967, and some of the regulation?

19

involved on the procedures followed by the Disciplinary Committe ;

20

had been rewritten that very year.

21

The regulations were rewritten immediately after this

22

case was brought.

23

opposing counsel can help us on that.

24
25

I do not know what the result is.

Perhaps

On whether we are talking about the facial or applicatory constitutionality of this situation, ‘I think the case does»

have to be considered in light of what the university is.

2

it is considerably more than just a group of scholars and

3

learners and second

4

ties today.

First!,

in light of what is happening in universi­

As obviously there is much unrest,, various authorities

5
6

have attributed this to the failure to extend constitutional

7

rights in the universities.
Q

8
9

Is the leaflet that is in controversy printed on

page 175 of the Appendix?

10

A

11

I think we should also consider that this University,

12

13
14

Tennessee State University, as is true with so many of the
smaller universities,state universities, around the nation
trains a lot of teachers„
As this Court has recognized for many years, McClaren

15
16
17
18
19

v. Oklahoma, they are training someone to be a leader and
trainer of others.

22

I would rather say that they are educating

someone to be a leader and educator of others, but I think it
is more accurately stated the first way.
Further, that those who will come under his guidance

20
21

Yes.

and influence must be directly affected by the education he
receives.

The education that the students at the Tennessee

State University are receiving is not one calculated to make
23
24
25

them sensitive to the demands of the Bill of Rights.
I think this statement is accurate with regard to

You say that that does not give notice that the

I think a direct insult would generally be

considered disrespectful.

vagueness doctrines do not look to specific conduct involved

where overbreadth is involved.

Now the first amendment void for

If we were dealing with a libel case under Times

7

and Sullivan, 1 would understand your argument a little bit

8

better.

9

Under Times and Sullivan you can call the president .

10

of a university or a senator or almost anyone else a racist

11

pig or what not with considerable impunity, but this is not a

12

libel case.

13

This is a situation where regulations were trying to

14

govern conduct to that civilized people could function in a

15

university complex without friction and without conflict, with

16

each other.

17

A

I have never observed a university yet in which

18

people functioned without friction and without conflict with

each other.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice and Associate

Justices.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

S

A

Mr. Roberts?

I want to first take care of a little matter of

7

the Reply Brief that was made to my Brief in which it was

8

alleged that I had made some erroneous statements.
There are only two points I want to raise in connec­

9
10

tion with that.

One is to the effect that I have left the

11

impression, at least, that the leafletting activity that this

12

Petitioner has been charged with, and found guilty, of was connect

13

ed in soma way with the arrival on the campus of Mr. Stokley

14

Carmichael and an ensuing riot that occurred.
I am wrong about that and I apologise to the Court

15
IS

and to opposing counsel.

17

passsed out at about this time and some of them before and some

18

after the riot occurred there on the campus in the summer of

19

1967.

20

the Administration invite Mr. Carmichael there.

21

did and the riot did result.

22

There had been a number of leaflets

There was one of them, for instance, that demanded that
They later

However, this particular leaflet which advocated and

23

urged the student body to boycott registration at the school

24

was passed out after the riot had occurred.

25

The second point that I v?ould make to the Reply Brief
14

-

1

is in regard to the charge against this Petitioner of being in

2

violation of city, county or state laws.

3

by the words of Dr. Payne, who was the Dean of Students and who

4

presided over these hearings, that he agreed that this was

5

not used against the student in the hearings.

6

not bear Mr. Boult out on that.

7

the entire record in regard to it.

3

It is urged here that

The record will

I think he has failed to read

What actually took place Mr. Hedgepath on page 12 of

S

the proceedings at the F.A.C. hearing made it clear that we

10

were, the school was^relying upon any disorderly conduct or

?!

conduct unbefitfcirg a student or any that violated the rules

12

of the Handbook there at the Institution.

13

70 - 78 there was about 8 full pages where it was developed

14

what Mr. Jones.had been convicted and paid a fine in the Metro­

15

politan Court for.

Further on at about

16

Those are the two points I wanted to raise on that.

17

We have made two issues out of the four that Petitione

18

had.

19

the entire matter of the procedure including the due process

20

rights of these Petitioners.

21

We feel that there are only two things involved.

As stated earlier, there were five original Petitioner

22

Two of them were dismissed at the time of the hearing.

23

the charges against them were dismissed.

24

found guilty of acts that warranted their suspension.

13

the Court and that is the fact that these students were not
expelled»

They were suspended.

They have not, this Petitioner

has not gone back to the school and sought readmission since
the suspension.

I don't know whether the school would allow hir>

readmittance or not.

He was an out-of-state student and he came

down there and he did things that they felt to be and found to
be disruptive.
This one piece of literature tried to impress his
will upon the other students, for example, and cause them not
register for school and thereby disrupt the entire procedure.
Q

Is there anything Petitioner did other .than to

pass out that leaflet which is in there?
A

Yes, sir, one thing else that he did there in

14

connection with the leaflet, he lied about it.

15

he did not do it despite the fact that the President of the

16

University says/'tB. handed me one himself right in front of the

17

Administration Building and he had about 50 of them in his hand

18

when he did it. "

19

He said that

**

A lady down in the cafeteria testified, there was soma

20

discrepancy about the date that she claimed that it was passed

21

out, but she said that there wasn't any question in her

and picked it up and read it.

25

Q

She went over

With the exception of passing out the leaflet

and lying about it, that is all?
16

A

Wo, sir, then the third thing is that he violated

a

the rules of the Student Handbook in that he was convicted and

3

:ined in the Metropolitan Court for two charges of disorderly

4

conduct.

I don't think we would do that without making

Yes, sir, of course, I think that it really be­

comes moot anyway.

You might recall that after this hearing

and after he certainly had notice at that time about it and was
accused of lying to them, we had a full-dress court hearing in
the U.S. District Court of Tennessee in Nashville.

Judge Hiller

agreed, of course, with the University officials in connection
with all of these things that they found against him.

Do you contend that, and I take it that you do,

Yes, air, I certainly do.

Mr. Jones claimed that,

he only passed out some other leaflets, one of -them, I think,
was called ‘The Black Thesis which was more or less a philosophi­
cal piece of writing.

Well now that wasn't, so far as I could

see, anything in there that would have bean disruptive.
But suppose that he had been able to persudae even
a substantial number of these students to refuse to register

when the term started certainly that would disrupt the school.

and then was brought up on charges?

It was approximately a month and a half.

This happened during the summer and they had already sent

the Summer Term of school.

Q

But he didn't disrupt anything, did he?

It didn't turn out that way, but I don’t believe

13

you have to wait until the horse is out of the barn before you

14

close the door.

Q

Will you show me in the record where those two

convictions are that you were talking about?

17

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

If you don’t mind.

19

A

The charge itself charged him with them and they

20
21

readily admitted it, and they are on page 70 to 78.
Q

In the record, where is the charge against him

22

printed in the record?

It is in my brief on page 5.

criminal activity that he was charged with takes place between

pages 70 and 78 of the transcript of the F.A.C. hearing.

that took place was the matter of this leaflet by which he

2!

attempted to disrupt orderly activities of the school, and even

22

in Tinker it is stated clearly that the orderly activities of

23

the school is not subject to first amendment rights.

We think that registration certainly is an orderly
and part of the

regular functions of the school.
