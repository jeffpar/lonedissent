ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABINOWITZ, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT SAMUELS
MR. 'RABINOWITZ:

IQ

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from the judgment of the three-judge

11

court sitting in the Southern District of New York, denying to

12

the plaintiffs an injunction of declaratory judgment against

13

the District Attorney of Queens County and the Attorney General

14

of the State of New York.

prosecution under the New York State Criminal Anarchy statute.

The plaintiffs seek to enjoin their

The eleven plaintiffs and five others were indicted
on charges of, one, advocacy of criminal anarchy; two, conspiracy
to commit advocacy of criminal anarchy; and in the case of one
of the plaintiffs, permitting his premises to be used for as sera
blages of anarchists.
The indictment contained altogether 48 counts, of whici|i
only six are under consideration here.

The other 42 counts

related to offenses such as illegal possession of guns and illegal
possession of explosives and weapons and conspiracy to commit
arson, and a whole series of other conventional crimes.

1

We are concerned here„ and we attack only that much

2

of the indictment, as relates to the New York Criminal Anarchy

3

law.

4

1902 and was applied once in 1921 in the Gitlow case,

&

was used again until 1964 when it was used to convict Mr. Epton.

6

The indictment was handed down here months after the New York

?

Court of Appeals decision in Epton and it raised fears in the

8

minds of not only the plaintiffs, but many others who are inter­

$

ested in civil liberties issues, of a widespread use of the state's

Now that law, as this Court will recall, was passed in
It was

10

sedition statutes, which had long been’considered moribund, but

ii

which had effectively stifled radical thought in the 8 20 's and

iz

like the Federal acts in the !50's.
In addition to the possession of guns and the conspiracy

13

U

to commit arson and the other what I referred to as conventional

15

crimes, two of the plaintiffs in this case were charged in simul

10

taneous indictments with conspiracy to commit murder.

\1

convicted and that case is pending here on a writ of certiorari.

They were

I mention this merely to indicate that to stress the

18
19

point and to emphasise the point, there are on the books of New

20

York, of course, many statutes, including those that are charged

21

in this case, to protect public order and to take people who

22

collect guns in order to seek to overthrow the Government or for

23

any other purpose.
There are three principal points raised by the appellants

24
25

here.

The first is that the New York Criminal Anarchy law on its;
4

1

face and as applied here violates the First and Fourteenth Amend

2

trsanfcs to the Constitution, both with respect to freedom of press

3

speech and assembly, and also with respect to due process of law

4

Second, that the New York statutes with respect to the

3

selection of grand jurors has a monetary qualification at that

6

time for services of a grand juror and that, therefore, the

7

Grand Jury which indicted, these defendants was illegally convenae

8
9

And, finally, that the Federal Government through the
Smith Act has preempted the field of sedition, including sedition

10

against the state.

I shall argue only the first of these points

11

here today and I am not abandoning the other points.

12

are good.

13

I know that those issues are not essential to the concern of the

14

Court here today and I shall just rely on my brief.

15

by current limitations and I would prefer to use my time to addrf ss

16

myself to the subject which I know concerns the Court most.

I think thc^y

We are relying on them, but they have been, briefed anc

We are limited

The first aspect, however, the New York Criminal Anarch y

17
18

law, is unconstitutionality and is, of course, a critical matter,

19

And this aspect of the case has also in its turn, I thik, three

20

aspects.

21

The first is whether Section 1983 of the Civil Rights

22

Act of 1871 is an exception to 2283 of this Judiciary Code, and

23

I think that issue must be met head-on.

24
25

The second is assuming that we can cross that threshold,
whether the Court should nevertheless abstain, and I think that
5

1

that issue has to be met head-on; and finally;» we get, I hope,
.

2

to the merits of the case, namely, whether the Act on its face

3

and as applied in this situation is ’unconstitutional»
.Now, the first question of the interrelation of 1983

4
5

of the Act of 1871 and Section 2283 of the Act of 1789, I guess

6

it is, is a matter which, of course, has been discussed almost

7

endlessly.

8

area of procedural rights in a — with respect to Federal juris­

9

diction over criminal cases that has caused quite as much judi­

It is hard to think of any question within the general

30

cial and law review over the last, two or three years.

1.1

m

The.issue was faced by a three-judge court in Cameron
[sic]
against Jackson. It was argued and briefed in that case in this

13

Court, but this Court never reached the problem and sent it back

14

to the District Court for decision on the merits.

We have collected the cases or tried to collect the

16

cases — the cases are not completely up to date in footnote 11,

1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 was intended by Congress as

a

an exception to 2283 of the Judiciary Code.

4

It is our contention that Section

Mr. Macke11 in his brief points out that 2283 was

5

enacted at a time in our history when the rights of the states

6

were primarily concerned.

7

passed at a time in our history when Congress was primarily con­

8

cerned with protecting the individual from injustices which they

9

feared would be perpetrated upon them by the state courts as a

That is quite true.

But 1983 was

10

result of the antagonisms, the tensions and the problems that had

1!

arisen out of the Civil War.

12

It was passed by the Reconstruction Congressas, and to

13

say that those Congresses did not intend to interfere with state

14

prosecution in certain kinds of cases was directly contrary to

15

the legislative history of that statute.

16

the appellees here and by the persons in other cases that our

17

interpretation of the 1983 will impeded the state courts in the

18

normal operation of the criminal laws.

19

exactly what was intended by Section 1983 of the Civil Rights

20

law and the legislative history makes it clear, not in all cases,

21

but in certain kinds of cases coming within Section 1983 that it

22

was the intent of Congress to protect persons whose rights were

23

being interfered with by state officials, including state courts

24

to protect them by giving them resort to a Federal Court.

25

And I cannot see how it is possible to read the

That is true, but that kind of case would be avail­

able.

That is, a. 1983 case would be available to the plaintiff

25

only in a case where he could come within the four corners of the

i

Act, namely, that his constitutional rights were being inter­

And he would have to come within that kind of a case.

I presume that in order to secure an injunction

from a Federal Court,, you would have to show more than a mere

allegation.

5

either the statute involved was on its face unconstitutional

6

because it deprived the petitioner or the plaintiff in that

situation of rights, privileges and immunities secured to him by

the Constitution of the United States, or some other action to

come within this statute.

You would have to present the situation in which

true.

the statute, which I submit is unconstitutional.
And it may be that on the outer reaches of this prob­
lem there will be questions raised, but we are not at the outer
reaches at the moment.

We are right at the center.

Q

What is the action of the circuits and divisions?

A

Well, the circuits have not only

within the circuits there have been divisions.

divided, but
And where there

have been in many situations — where there have been decisions,
for example, in the Fourth Circuit,

I believe that the Fourth

Circuit has held that 1983 is not an exception to 2283, but
there is a very strong dissent by Chief Judge ;Sobelof£.
In several cases in the Fifth Circuit the same conclu­
sion, but again there have been dissents by Judges Reid and

24

Risdo, so that — though in the Third Circuit, I think Cooper

25

against Hutchison, the decision is the other way.

unanimous decisions,, and have — and those two courts have held

8

that 2283 is not a jurisdictional statute at all, but that 2283

9

is a discretionary statute and.-, that it is, I suppose, equivalent

10

Both of them am

to the whole question of abstention»
I must get on, if I may, Your Honors»

11
12

One is a decision by

I know this is

critical.
On the question of abstention, leaving the statute

13
14

aside, because 1 would assume that the general rules of Douglas

IS

against Jeannette and so forth might cause a court to hold that

1©

he is going to abstain, even if he has jurisdiction under 2283.

17

It still may abstain, and I raise the question as to whether

18

abstention has any justification at all in this case.
Incidentally, the right of the court to abstain, Mr.

19
20

Justice White, is perhaps the answer to your question, that

21

where there are merely matters of evidence involved that the

22

Federal Court, out of consideration for comity and all the con­

23

siderations in Douglas against Jeannette will decide that it will

24

abstain.

25

In this case there is no reason for abstention at all. I

in the Epton case, what the state court is going to decide

10

because it is very unclear on its face, but it is clear because

11

there has been a limiting construction, we contend, and an uncon­

13

an unconstitutional application in the Epton case.

It has given that limiting construction

Epton, in effect, has been running .interference for

14
15

us.

He has cleared a way.

There are ambiguities in the statute

16

and there is no reason for further abstention by this Court,

17

because nothing will be done by a statute.

18

New York Court of Appeals is going to hold, and what it is going

19

to hold is that it has amended the Gitlow statute so that it

now has a limiting construction.

ARGUMENT OP ELEANOR J. PIEL, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FERNANDEZ

a
4

MRS. PIEL:

My client in this ease is Fred Fernandes.

He is one of the 15 subject to the indictment.
I want to commence my argument, going on from Mr.

5

6

Rabinowitz's argument? on the theory that the issue of 2283 and

7

1983? I think? can well be answered, as J4r. Rabinowitz answered

3

it.

9

after one says? "Yes? there is the power to enjoin,” it is obvi­

But I am not sure that that is an adequate answer? because

10

ously not a principle which is promofcive of peace in the states

11

to have the Federal Courts interfering whenever there is a claim

12

of unfairness below.

IS

And so I have culled over some of the opinions of this

14

Court and some of the writings of the American Law Institute

15

with regard to th&ir consideration of this subject.

16

me that we can set up four considerations or reasons which all

17

obtain in this ease?, which would persuade a court not to abstain

18

from a decision with regard to a constitutional issue.

19

It seems to

The general premise is that a Federal Court will

20

abstain and permit a state court to decide the issues of consti­

21

tutionality where they are raised.

22

Now the first consideration has to do with the First

23

Amendment and? generally speaking? this Court has been more sen­

24

sitive to issues of First Amendment? particularly when there is

25

a rise in' the states? and for a number of reasons — in order to

18

1

create the uniformity of law in the United States and in order

2

to protect the First Amendment, which sometimes in the heat of

3

the battle below, or whatever, state jurisdictions are not as

4

sensitive to the issues»
I am going to mention these four factors and then go

5
6

back, over them.
The second one ties into the first Amendment and it

7
8

has to do with when the issue involving the First Amendment has

9

to do with the public business.

I am referring to the language

10

used by Mr. Justice White when in the Red Lion case, when he

1?

referred to the kind of public business that Alexander Michel-

12

john talks about the First Amendment.

13

right of people to hear arguments and the right of people to

14

speak.

15

He is talking about the

When we. are in the area of sedition, you are in the

IS

area of the public business, because you are talking about govern­

17

ments and some peoples' idea about what is wrong with it.

18

Then the third factor has to do -- and it is a very

19

important question -- and that is, can the constitutional issue,

20

even though it involves the First Amendment, even though it

21

involves the public business, can it be solved by the state route?

22

Is the issue something that the state court has not yet had an

23

opportunity to rule on?

24

state ground, as in the recent case that had to do with Alaskan

25

fishing rights.

Perhaps there is even an independent

This Court abstained.
19

Mr. Justice Douglas

1

wrote the opinion.

‘This Court abstained because there might ever

2

have been a decision there based upon the Alaska Constitution,,

3

so that even though there were important issues, it is not appro­

4

priate for this Court to interfere.
Then there is a fourth ground, which is that the Consti­

S
6

tution itself is unfair and discriminatory and perhaps a law

7

which is not ordinarily invoked against a defendant is used.

8

And that Is the fourth basis, and that fourth basis was mentioned

9

in the American Law Institute series of reasons given when they

10

decided — of course, they are not the Supreme Court — but there

11

are a number of judges sitting on it, and they decided that 1983

12

— or there is an exception, there should be an exception in the

13

law to the absolute caveat against the Federal Court issuing an

14

injunction against the state court and constitution.

15

Q

(Inaudible)

16

A

Well, it hasn't been with regard to the Banking

17

Act.

18

as to other instances when it is not written in.

19

I believe that there is a whole line of opinions that show

Certainly the way 1983 is phrased, which gives a liti­

20

gant a right to relief, equitable or otherwise, would suggest

21

that it is an express exception.

22

23
24
25

Now in all of these consideration I think we start out
with the fact that we are talking about equity, so it is all of
these considerations which do not obtain or are not persuasive,
then it is something that perhaps should be sent back to the state
20

1

court.

adequate remedy.

3

although originally it may have been intended to overlap 1983, I

4

think today a litigant would have a pretty hard time using it

5

in one of these cases.

But Mr. Justice Marshall mentioned removal might be an

3

during the Civil War period and its aftermath.

4

Mow with regard to this application to the instant

5

case, the question was asked was the Court of Appeals opinion in

6

Epton the knowing interpretation is that narrowing interpretation

7

constitutional?

8

the highest court in the State of Mew York, in trying to read

9

into 160 and 161, and presumably if that obtains, it would also

13

And 1 submit that it is not, for the reason than

be read into the new statutes which supersede

160 and 161, which

it already passed but was not yet effective at the time the
highest court of the State of New York interpreted the statute.
That highest court left out of its language language

14

which appears in Brandenburg, which has to do with the require­

15

ment for the validity of a sedition statute that the danger of

16

overthrow or of lawful action be imminent.

17
18
19

20
21

22

Now that has been

left out of the interpretation of the — in Epton and it is left
out 6£ the statute's interpretation and it also is missing from
the indictment.

If you will read the indictment in this case,

you will read that there are no considerations of clear and
present danger in the indictment and all you have is the allega­
tion that these defendants with regard to the anarchy counts

23

advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence

24

with intent that it take place, but not any allegation as to the

25

likelihood of it taking place or any allegation ~~ and this is
22

1

another consideration that comes out of Yates and Dennis and

2

Bradenburg, but Brandenburg not so much — that the group doing

3

the advocacy of the,overthrow of the Government be of sufficient

4

size and strength to actually prevent such a threat.
Now Epfcon did one more thing.

5

Although the Court said

6

in Epton — that is* the Court of Appeals — that clear and

7

present danger has to be read into the statute, when it applied

a

that doctrine to Epton, what it really said was that the clear

9

and present danger would not have to be the clear and present

10

danger of the overthrox^ of the Government of the United States.

1!

All it had to be was clear and present danger of the riots then

12

rocking Harlem continue.
I submit that that is the real meaning of Epton, and

1.3
14

looked at that way, the State of New York has an unconstitutiona:

15

statute which it is trying to apply to these defendants.
Now when I speak of the public business, I think it is

16
17

very important that you know how this case fits into the public

ia

business.

and it is attached to the appellant’s brief and also filed with

21

the Court, we attach a number of newspaper stories,

23

people were indicted and, it is very clear from the language used

24

in these press releases that the direction of the action is agai: ist

She thought of these defendants.

We do allege in our complaint that this is a harassing

23

all of whicljt

1

Now, quoting the District Attorney on page 67 here,

2

the press releases that appeared in the press, he said that

3

Stokely Carmichael, a leading black power advocate, had connec­

4

tions with RAM — that is the Revolutionary Action Movement,

S

which was dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system

6

in the U. S. by violence, if necessary.

7

Now parenthetically this is anarchy or the attempt

8

to overthrow the government of the State of New York, that ail

S

of these press releases have to do with the attempt to overthrow

10

the Government of the United States.

11

Again Mackell said the arrested RAM members are fol­

12

lowers of Premier Mao Tse-tung and are associated with another

13

Negro organization called ‘'Black Americans Unite or Perish,"

14

headed by Robert Williams.

15

Negro militants across the nation, following rioting in Atlanta,

16

Tampa, Dayton, Cincinnati and Watts.

17

And again their intent was to stir

And then finally -- I think this really caps the First

te

Amendment public business part of my argument — in discussing

19

the defendants, Mackell said that Fernandez — that is my client

20

— who headed a group of approximately 20 youths between the ages

21

of 16 and 21, may well have tried to influence with Eevolutionari

22

Action Movement ferocity.

23

And finally, Queens District Attorney Mackell said that

24

that 16 arrested on various charges were members of RAM's anarach 1st

25

group which Federal authorities say is pro-Communist, pro-China

24

1

and pro-Cuba.

2

That is the final one.

"The police investigation int6 this matter dates back

3

two years," Macke11 declares.

"I have had Assistant District

4

Attorney Thomas di Marcos of Jackson Heights on this case everr

5

since we -were informed about it.

another problem.

And there is

By the time this case is tried there is, as

you have heard, 48 counts in this indictment.

Only five of these

involve my client, four of which involve anarchy and the fifth
one involves conspiracy to commit arson in the third degree.

29

Now by the time the jury has heard all of the testimony

21

with regard to anarchy, I predict that my client will be convicts

22
23

24
25

of arson in the third degree.

This is, of course, a distinction

from Dombrowski where the contention was made that the criminal
charges were brought against the defendant with no possibility
of their being a conviction.
25

1

In this case we say that there is a strong possibility

2

of a conviction and that the anarchy serve to prejudice the case

3

as a trial before the jury.

4

District Attorney in his brief that he needs the anarchy charges

5

in order to supply the factor of intent as to the illegal gun

6

7
8

charges, which he raised not against my client, who is a casualty'
perhaps of this entire adventure, but he attached intent to the
gun charges against the other defendants.
Wow the other aspect of what can happen is exactly wha :

And when he

was convicted, the judge gave him a sentence which was. concurren :

Federal Court, to secure a fair trial and absolution by the stati
method.

cution by statute and 1 do think it is important for the Court to
consider this.

26

history.
It has been used in Gitlow in 1920, and it was revived

2
3

44 years later in Epton, and it was only upon the heels of the

4

Court of Appeals opinion in Epton, which came down May 16, 1967,

5

that these indictments were brought in against these 15 defen­

6

dants .
So, it is clearly a discriminatory prosecution.

7

Now

8

it seems to me that if there is ever a case for the kind of

9

relief which is available for Federal intervention, this is it.

10

There is a further argument that was made, and I want to make if

11

because I think it dramatises the validity of the relief request

12

And that has to do with the Grand Jury point.
Since this case was argued, this Court has come down

13
14

with two decisions which suggest that the 250 property limitation

15

might well be invalid, but in another decision you have said that

16

the subjective standards that we claim here might be administerec

17

fairly, so that the statute on its face would only be a little

18

bit unconstitutional.

I say "a little bit" advisedly.

19

I think that against the standards that I have just set

20

up, straw standards, that it is a challenge to the statute on the

21

basis of the First Amendment.

There is one problem, and that is another argument, I

19

think, in support of not abstaining here, and that is the right

20

of the defendant in a criminal case and plaintiff in an action

21

such as this to finally get some kind of relief from the court.

In other words, these actions pending over a long period of time

those sections are set forth at page 8 and page 9 of ray brief

on reargument and also the original brief, allows us to combine

4

defendants and charges in one indictment, provided we separately

5

number each crime in a count, and that provision appears in Sec­

6

tion 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedures.

7

mention of it is this, at this stage:

8

in one indictment the indictment now before the Court 15 defen­

dants and 48 counts.

But again our Cods of Criminal Procedures, and

The reason I make

Because we have combined

We could have had 111 different indictment

10

and then moved to consolidate them on the ground of the common

11

issues.
The test for putting these counts in one indictment

12
13

is there are four different circumstances in 279.

The one that

14

we selected is where the crimes charged ware connected together

IS

and are part of a common scheme or plan.
Nov/ by motion before the Appellate Court you can —

16
17

before the trial court these Indictments can be settled.

Now

18

these things, then, are by law, by the law of pleading in crimina

19

matters in our state inter-related charges.
I want to also state that in these 48 counts the first

20
21

four of them deal with criminal anarchy and charge all the defen­

22

dants with the commission of that crime.

23

with anarchy and the fourth is conspiracy to commit a criminal

24

act.

25

The first three deal

Now the other counts in the indictment have nothing to
34

do with criminal anarchy, but are there because they are inter­

2

related with the ultimate purpose of this indictment.

case.

It does not — that count is not charged against every­
Many of these defendants are not charged with that in thi;s

Counts 6 and 7 deal with permitting premises to be

7

8

used for anarchy.
The remaining counts, 41 in all, deal with weapons.

9
10

Now this may be a little bit abstruse, but it is important to make

H

this one point, that four of these 41 counts that deal with wea­

12

pons deal with handguns and 37 deal with shoulder guns.

13

the Weapons Law of New York, as I told the Court last time I was

14

the author of it, mere possession of a handgun in four of these

15

41 counts is all the prosecution has to establish to convict of

16

a crime.

17

you need of proof of intent to use unlawfully against another.

18

And there is a good reason for that.

Under

But the shoulder guns — rifles, shotguns, carbines —

19

A lot of people have rifles to hunt animals.

20

tols and revolvers and automatic weapons normally are used only

21

to hunt other human beings.

22

But pis­

The only proof of intent to use unlawfully against

23

another we have for this indictment, and the only evidence that

24

was before the Grand Jury at the time the case was presented, wak

25

the intent to paralyze and overthrow local government.
35

\

Consequently,, when counsel said that you can't when

2

irreparable injury is done raise an immediate because of the

3

possibility of concurrent sentences in this case.

4

so, and I will demonstrate why it is not.

5

That is not

Because there are, first of all, four defendants in th:.s

6

case who are not charged with possession of weapons — I will

7

amend that, there are five who are not charged with possession

8

of weapons — Harriet Knowle, Raymond Smith, Fernandes, Miss

9

West and Max Stanford,

Those five are not charged with any

10

possession of weapons in this indictment.

11

didn't possess weapons, but because when these search warrants

12

were executed, they were not found in possession of the weapons.

13

It isn!t because they

Therefore, these five people -- of these five people,

14

three of them are charged with no anarchy crimes at all.

15

these five cases —■ pardon me, with no nonanarchy crimes.

16

three of these five cases w® have persons who could be convicted

17

only of anarchy-connected crimes and not of any correlative crimes.

18

The doctrine of concurrent sentences would not apply.

19

So in
In

If I am not mistaken, as I read Benton against Mary­

20

land, this Court last term abandoned the concurrent sentence

21

doctrine anyway.

22

no longer holds.

So that the

23

But in any case we have three parsons that could be

24

convicted solely of these anarchy-connected crimes under this

25

indictment and would have full opportunity to bring the validity

By the way, the Hew York statute that we are talking

court of the state came down with their decision on May 16, 1967
one month and four days before the Grand Jury indicted the per­
sons in this case.
Now it is true that some of the acts for which these
people are accused took place prior to the announcement of the
decision in Epton.

But there is one other unusual feature of

19

our weapons laws in New York, and that is the amnesty feature.

20

And under the amnesty feature any person at that time, if they

21

had read Epton when it came down on May 16th and following law

22

as closely as counsel seems to suppose they would, could come ini

in during any month — and hand over these guns with amnesty and

What we are concerned was, in this case, the amassing

12

of an arsenal for th® purpose of paralysing and overthrowing

13

a government.
Now this Court in its most recent pronouncement on the

14
15

question of free speech, Brandenburg at the last terra on June

16

9th, said that you may punish a person for advocacy, for words,

17

provided it is accompanied by inciting and producing lawless

IS

action and there is probably cause that that lawless action woulc

19

occur.

20

Now the minutes of the Grand Jury which are here before,

21

this Court show that they assembled 9,000 rounds of ammunition.

22

They assembled cans of gasoline, cans of oil, intending to burn

23

the subways, the power plants, the lumber yards, the tire fac­

No stay has ever been issued? but it has been

dispose of it.
We have in a second indictment convicted two of these

21

22
23
24
25

appellates in this case, Ferguson and Harris.

They were con­

victed of conspiring to murder Whitney Young and Roy Wilkins.
They had other people on the list as well, but they were the
first two.
39

1

They had a trial before a jury and in the intermediate

2

appellate court five judges found unanimously that there was

3

sufficient evidence to convict them.

4

of the five, on the grounds that because Senator Robert Kennedy,

5

whose name was also on the list of those to be killed, was men­

6

tioned at a time when he was lying between life and death, that

7

a new trial should be granted but the judge should have granted

8

a continuance.

9

But two judges dissented,,

The highest court of our state, seven judges found

10

identical, unanimously, that there was sufficient evidence to

11

convict murder in the first degree and — but three of them

12

agreed that maybe the trial judge should have granted a continual.ce

13

on the circumstance of the assassination of Senator Kennedy.

14

I v?ould like to say this in connection with the ques­

15

tion of Section 2291.

16

that statute on the books, sine© March 2, 1793, and never once

17

has this Court in any way said that a lower court, that is a

18

creature of Congress, must not observe that statute.

19

20

25

I mean 2283.

For 177 years we have had

For 99 years —* since 1891 — we had the provision of
Section 1903, the so-called Civil Rights Act, which gives the
person a course of action, an action at law, a suit in equity or
other proper means of redress if any rights, privileges or imreun
ties can guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the United
States are taken away from him under color of state law.
Never in' 99 years has this Court ever held that that

&

an exception to 1983.
Now recently this Court has taken up the question —

3
4

they took it up in Dombrowski against Pfister —• and, very care­

5

fully Justice Brennaa, in writing that opinion, observed the

6

restriction of the Act of 1793, and Justic Harlan in his dissent­

7

ing opinion also called the attention of the Court that if there

8

had been an action pending at the time of application to the

9

Federal Court, then of course this Court could not authorize

10

intervention below.
Again it carae up in several other cases,

11

Cameron

12

against Johnson is a good illustration of this.

It cams up from

13

Mississippi and was sent back by this Court to the District

14

Court in the Southern District of Mississippi, to have them deter

15

mine whether 2283 was a bar, and District Court of Mississippi,

16

a three-judge district covirt, came back and said, "Yes, we think

17

the suit is barred by 2283."

And this Court affirmed it.

But there was a footnote by Justice Douglas where he

18

19

said, "Well, we don't have to decide the question of 2283."

20

still this Court did affirm the determination of the District

21

Court of Mississippi.

But

Again in Brooks against Briley, Tennessee, the same

22

thing.

The 26 words that were put in amending the parent

statute, the Judiciary Act of 1789 •— 26 v/ords have to be observed,

15

Nov/ this Court has repeatedly said — in 1941 they said it, too,

IS

in the Toucey case — they said that we must be scrupulous about

17

the meets and bounds that become effect because of their own

18

creation.

19

They must be scrupulous.
And then in 1948, when Congress codified three excep­

20

tions, in 1951 this Court resisted it.

21

of 1793 — and at that time they said,

22

25

Once again the statute
"You have got to go by

those three exceptions of Congress and you can't go any further.'
Now there is another consideration involved here,
interrupting, and that is the same as a Federal prosecution.
that is that this tribunal, which is a constitutional tribunal

How can we then say that this Court is going by statu­

10
11

tory interpretation?

This isn't a constitutional question, and

12

give to lower courts a power it doesn't even arrogate to itself.

13

While Congress has the power, unless this Court wants

14

to overrule ex parte McCardle -— Congress has the power to take

15

this case and get away from this Court now by taking appellate

16

jurisdiction over any question, let's say, of denial of injunc­

17

tion by three»judge courts below.
Unless we overrule ex parte McCardle, which involves

free speech, that would be the result.

Under pending indictments in ou

I may add this, too, if I may, that this type of inter

ruption of a state criminal proceeding does not give us, the

13

states, the opportunity to respond to charges in the indictment.

14

Now in the Brandenburg case this Court pointed out that there

15

was no refinement of the charge in that case either by the trial

16

judge or by the highest court of the State of Ohio.

17

In our case there are many more stages of refinement

that this proceeding has interrupted.

89 of the appendix to my brief, Section 295-g of the Code of

Criminal Procedure says, "Mandatorily in the form of indictment

I thank you.

16

May I ask just one thing, Your Honor,

One of my

17

assistants -- 1 have no reason to know why a greater privilege

18

to use force is allowed when political dissent is involved than,

19

for example, in self-defense or defense of another or defense of

20

your habitation.
Just because you are attempting to overthrow the Goven

21

22

ment, it seems to me, does not give you a broader privilege to

23

use force than if you are committing an ordinary crime of

24

robbery.

25

Now as between robbery and criminal anarchy there is
51

1

this distinction.

If a robber sets out and succeeds in getting

2

the loot, faking it from a client, he is not home free, because

3

he may later be apprehended and put in jail.
But if an anarchist overthrows the local government,

4
3

sets out to do it and succeeds, then he is home free.

an epigram from Sir John Harrington in the 17th Century.

says, "Treason doth never succeed.

treason succeed, none dare call it treason."

Thank you.

Aside from the nonspeech elements, which have already

The Court said, and I quote:

"The damage which such

an attempt would create, both physically and politically, to a

nation, makes it impossible to measure the validity in terms of

probability of success."
These words are of particular significance in light of

State courts have the same duty and power to rule upon

and in most cases where a prosecution is already pending, this

would adhere in resolving the issues in the state courts.

The statute is over-broad.

The states have the same

power as the Federal Courts to strike it down and prevent a
