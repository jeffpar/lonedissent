MR. SWEENEY:
the Court:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

It is not without some regret that the State of

Maryland arises this morning as the Appellant in this case,
because we are not without sympathy for the plight in which the
Appellees have found themselves.

They are citizens of the

United States of America, they reside within the geographical
boundaries of the State of Maryland, they pay certain taxes to
the State of Maryland, and most understandably, they are
desirous of having the right to vote.
I might also say that were this a matter of personal
discretion for the Attorney General of Maryland, or for the
Governor or Maryland, with whom we have discussed this, we, out
of sympathy, would extend that right to vote to them.
But, we also submit to the court that in a government
of laws and not of men, that this question is one that should
not and cannot be decided out of sympathy for the Appellee3s

23
24

position, but it is a question to which the laws of the United
States, the Constitution of the United States, and the laws of

25
2

1

Maryland must be applied,, and a decision rendered after con-

2

sideration of -those laws.

3

I further suggest to the Court that the opinion of

4

the District Court below, the District Court, which we believe

5

isone of the finest District Courts in the United States, not-

withstanding its occasional error, as in the instant case, that
the opinion of the District Court below was decided from an
overabundance of sympathy for the plaintiffs, and that that
opinion, we respectfully submit, is mistaken in fact, and
erroneous in law.
At: the outset let me state that Appellants and
Appellees alike concede that the land in question here is that
over which the Government of the United States had exclusive
legislative jurisdiction.

It was not the policy of the State

of Maryland, in ceding jurisdiction to the Federal Government
on any of the many Federal reservations scattered throughout
our state, to reserve to ourselves, concurrent jurisdiction,
except that reservation which has become almost, standard, the
reservation as,to serving process.
The question as to whether or not a resident of a
Federal enclave, over which th& United States exercised exclu­
sive legislative jurisdiction, whether those individuals were
entitled to vote was considered by the Court of Appeals of
Mai*yland as recently as 1963, when some residents of the Perry
Point Naval Hospital in Cecil County in Maryland, applied for

25

1

the right to register, were refused that right and appealed to

2

the courts.
In the Court of Appeals8 decision in that case, Royer

3

4

versus the Board of Elections Supervisors, the Maryland Court

5

of Appeals carefully considered the long line of cases in which

6

the courts throughout this nation have considered this same

7

question and after consideration of those cases, and after re­

8

view of what we believe to be the pertinent Federal Law on this

9

question, concluded that these individual residing on these

10

reservations, were not, in fact, residents of the State of

11

Maryland,
It appears to us from our study of the law that dating

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

from 1811 down to as recently as six months ago in New Mexico,
the courts throughout the United States have held thatpersons
residing on Federal x*eservations, over which there is exclusive
legislative jurisdiction vested in the Congress by virtue of
Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution, those
persons are not residents of the state.

They do not have the

same political rights as do the residents of the state which
surrounds them, and that the sovereignty and the authority and
the dominion of those states, the states surrounding these
reservations does not exist over the individuals residing
therein.
In this long line of cases considered by the courts
throughout the country, there are but three representing a

4

1

minority view, or there were but three representing a minority

2

view, until the decision of the District Court.

3

three are not really applicable to the case at hand, because

4

one of those involved a state which had reserved to itself,

5

concurrent jurisdiction; another involved a state statute and

6

only one, the decision of the — an intermediate Court of

7

Appeals in California, followed the line of reasoning which

8

was adopted by the District Court in this case.

9

May it please the Court;

Two of those

The arguments which we

to

present today would appear to be the first arguments addressed

1!

to this Court on this specific question; on the question of

12

whether or not the residents of these enclaves must be granted

13

the right to vote.

14

of first impression to this Court; it is not a question of which

15

this Court has not taken notice on prior occasions, because the

18

Court in Surplus Trading in 1930 in holding that certain blanket s

17

inthe hands of a trader on a Federal reservation were not sub­

18

ject to state

19

But the question itself, is not a question

taxation.

This Court set out at great length in its opinion and

20

adopted, we believe, the language of some of the state courts

21

which had held, and quoted the language of the state courts
which it held that the residents of these Federal enclaves are
noc entitled to vote, to be treated for voting purposes, like
the citizens of the state surrounding them.
!

The District Court decision on which we have appealed,
5

1

starts out by restating the premise that where the United

z

States exercises its exclusive legislative jurisdiction, over

3

land within a state, that the persons residing thereon, are

4

not residents, are not residents, and need not be granted the

5

vote.

6

Then, having, we believe, correctly stated below, the

7

court goes on to examine the so-called retrocessions statutes,

8

various statutes by which the Congress of the United States,

9

from 1928 on, has purportedly retroceded to the states certain

10

jurisdiction over the inhabitants of these reservations.

11

the court, after a review of these statutes, then concludes

12

that the United States, in fact, having retroceded its jurisdic­

13

tion in what it says is all or substantially all of the impor­

14

tant matters of state sovereignty and authority, that this

juri; ~iction is not exclusively Federal, but is concurrent
between the state and the Federal Government, and it being
concurrent, the state, the District Court said, is required to
extend that most precious right of all, it says, the right to
vote, to the Petitioners.
We submit, Your Honor, first of all, that an examina­
tion of these retrocession statutes will quickly reveal that
they do not retrocede to the State of Maryland or to any other
state, the all or substantially all of the state sovereignty
over these areas? nor do they give to the state concurrent
jurisdiction with the Federal Government in the important areas
6

1

of sovereignty.
What do they do?

Quickly stated,, one extends to the

3

residents of these enclaves, the benefits and the detriments of

the State of Maryland9s wrongful death statute.

Q

How about state income, sales and gasoline

A

I was just about to say, Mr. Justice, that the

taxes?

two that were of most interest to the District Court were the
Buck Act and the Lee Act, which gave to the states the right to
exact income and sales taxes.

That’s the Buck Act and the Lee

Act which gave the states the right to levy taxes on motor
fuels sold in the enclave.
These, obviously, were of great interest to the Dis­
trict Court and I submit to Your Honors, it is because of the
application of the Buck Act and the application of the Lee Act
that the District Court reached its conclusion.
The Buck Act gave to the State of Maryland the right
to levy certain taxes on the residents of these enclaves.

It

gave the state the right tolevy income taxes and it gave the
7

?
state the right to levy sales and use taxes.

2
Further, the District. Court noted that although the
3
State of Maryland has absolutely no jurisdiction of any kind
4
to try one sitxiated in a Federal reservation for any crime,
5
any criminal violation of the state law.

The District Court

8
noted that the Congress had enacted as long ago as 1825 the
7

Assimilative

]

Crimes Act and the court says that subf/t anti ally

8
this means that the state criminal laws are enforced on the

9

reservation.

10
And it was really because of these, because we exact

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

24
25

income and sales taxes and because of the Assimilative Crimes
Act that I believe the District Court found that we had all or
substantially all of the sovereignty over these individuals,
as we do over residents of the state.
And it is in this, Mr. Justice, that we said that the
court has been mistaken in the facts.
First of all, I think this Court can take judicial
notice of the fact that the income taxes and sales taxes of any
state are levied for the purpose of providing the monies
which are used for such public projects as: highways, schools,
colleges, libraries and we believe that enacting the Buck Act
giving us the right to impose sales and income taxes on these
residents, the Congress of the United States was merely saying
to the State of Maryland and to the other states that "We
recognise that these individuals who are employed by us

8

1

within the geographical borders of your states, are utilizing

2

certain state services and we recognize the inequity of your

3

providing these services for them without any return on your

4

part ,"

5

And so we believe, Your Honors, that the passage of

6

the Buck Act was merely an exercise in Congressional equity,

7

giving to the state that to which the state was already en­

8

titled from the services which we supplied to the Appellees,

9

And I might also point out, as the District Court did

10

not, that when the Congress of the United States enacted the

11

Buck Act, they appended to that Act a phrase which said that

12

Nothing contained herein shall be held to have surrendered the

13

exclusive legislative jurisdiction that the Congress of the

14

United States exercises under Article I, Section 8, over the

15

lands here in question,”

16

I believe that this? may it please the Court, is

17

strongly persuasive of the fact that the District Court erred

18

when it held to the contrary,

19

Q

May I ask you a question, Mr, Attorney General?

20

A

Yes, Mr, Justice,

21

Q

22

I suppose the foundation of this constitutional

challenge is the equal protection clause; isn't it?

23

A

Yes, sir,

24

Q

How would you describe the state interest, what

25

state interest is being served in making the distinction between
9

i

those on the enclave who are otherwise residents of the

4

A

The state's interest in this cause is this —

S

Q

You've got it under the law; you've got it on

6

your books, I know, but you have to defend it in terms of some

7

kind of a rational or under the equal protection —

8

A

The simple fact that it is unjust and discrimin­

9

atory to the other citizens of Maryland, those who reside

10

within our geographical borders, but off the reservation.

11

is unjust to them to extend, for us to extend the vote to

12

persons living on the reservation and for whom we have ab­

13

solutely no sovereignty; over whom we have absolutely no

14

authority and no dominion, excepting that authority and so

sovereignty granted to us which we hold at the sufferance of
another sovereign.
We can do absolutely

nothing on this reservation and

that is the state interest in this question.

Are we to be

required by the District Court or by the courts of the United
States, to give the right to vote to people who are eompletsiy
immune from a state criminal prosecution of any kind while on
the land on which they reside?
The Assimi.lat.ive Crimes Act, my brother in his brief,
says, as the District Court, that substantially the same, end is
achieved but the Federal Government, under the Act of 1825 and
10

1

as airsanded,, will enforce on the reservation the laws of the

2

stats, and we say that there is a material difference between

3

having the laws of the State of Maryland enforced on that

4

reservation by the United States Attorney.

means that the State of Maryland does not decide whom it shall

prosecute.

Q

As to the people themselves, not the Government,

but as to the residents, with the exception of not paying real
property taxes, what, else is there that they don't have to do
for the state that every other citizen does?
A

In the traditional phrase, "Thank you for asking

that question, Mr. Justice."

We believe that an examination

of the laws of Maryland will reveal that there are substantial
burdens which are carried by the people of Maryland from which
the Appellees are exempted.
First of all, and this Court will know, as students of
the law, and as men versed in Government, that a substantial
body of law of every government is contained in the regulations

24

and rules of the governmental agencies, aside from that which
25

11

appears on the statute books„
The persons living on Federal reservations within the
State of Maryland are totally and completely exempt from the

county governments in the county or municipal governments in

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR, SWEENEY:

May it please the Court:

authority the state could not exercise on residents of govern­

9

ment enclaves.

Just to hit. the highlights of some of that authority,
I mentioned that they are completely exempt from regulatory
authority over the 220-odd boards, agencies and commissions of
the state, of all similar county agencies, which means that
for example, the State of Maryland is completely without power
to enforce with the boundaries of the Federal enclave, the
liquor control statutes of the state or of the county.
The State of Maryland is completely without authority
to enforce within the confines of the enclave, such state
health department regulations as those whi©h require compulsory
vaccination, obviously, of paramount concern to the health of
all in the vicinity; on or off the enclave.
The doctors; who practice their profession at the
National Institute of Health and the attorneys who practice
there are free to do so without being required to subject them­
selves for licensing or examination by the State Board of
13

1

Medical Examiners, or by the State Board of Lav; Examiners, and

are not subject to the authority of the — lawyers? for example,

15

And I mention these merely to show

I say this? Mr. Justice? that there is a total

absence of authority for the proposition that the Federal Govern­
ment may prosecute cn the Federal reservation under the
Assimilative Crimes Act for violation of a state regulation?
even -when that regulatory? measure has criminal sanctions attached
to it.
So, in the instance that you gave perhaps it would fall

14

1

within the area of a substantial crime f but in the great

2

majority of regulatory measures, even though our statutes might

3

provide that violations of any of the regulations of the Health

4

Department or the Department of Natural Resources amounts to a

5

misdemeanor, if it is, in fact, a regulatory agency and I am

6

citing the Interdepartmental Report on the statuts of Federal

7

enclaves, there is absolutely no authority for the proposition

8

that the Federal Government may prosecute under the Assimilative

9

Crimes Act.

Yes .

You do have some legislative authority

over the residents of the enclave?
A

Beyond dispute, and I think I —

Q

As a matter of fact, quite a few powers over the

residents, so that

you say that the Federal Government has

exclusive jurisdiction even though they have ceded a good deal
of it back to the state.

Bo you say that because you think the

Federal Government can take it back?
A

I think that, again, there is a question of law

to which there is nc answer at this time.
Q

But, assume they couldtake it back, nevertheless

exclusive legislative authority over the enclave.

How can it be exclusive if substantial blocks

unless there is a similar Federal statute and if there is a

similar Federal statute, then that prevails, or unless the

State criminal statute is contrary to the public policy of the

United States.

And vhenver you raise your sales tax, enclave

residents pay it?

Yes, they do; yes, they do.

No.

What the Buck Act does is say to Maryland:

"You can collect tares from them, " not all taxes, these
specific taxes.

It concludes, as I mentioned earlier, by

saying "This is not to be taken as the determination of ex­
clusive Federal juri.sdiction therein."
Q

I know, but — I*m familiar with the idea that

you may have Federal Law, but what it is is borrowed state law.

Not sir; I*m sorry.

Out suggested solution to

this is the passage by the Congress of a bill such as was intro­
duced first under President Eisenhower and has been considered
by a succession of Congresses, which would retrocede to the

12

state all of the jurisdiction on these areas, all of it which

13

the Federal Government does not need for the specific purpose

14

for which they are utilizing these preraises.
Then we say we will have concurrent jurisdiction; not

15

exclusive, but concurrent, and if it is, in fact, truly con­
current, then I think under the weight of the cases throughout
the United States, they

the Courts

right from both tests.

24

Q

You do?

25

A

And in that connection I would like to point out
23

1

that it might be useful to focus on the specific facts surround

2

ing the acquisition of exclusive jurisdiction by the United

3

States over the tract in issue here.

4

The tract with which we are dealing,, is a tract lying

5

in Montgomery County to which the United States acquired title

6

in the 1930s and then built the National Institutes of Health

7

on it.

8

1940s, became registered voters, some around 1960 and still

9

later,» others moved onto the tract in the 1950s.

10

Plaintiffs in this case moved onto the tract,in the

It was only in 1953 that the legislature of the State

11

of Maryland ceded jurisdiction and thus created the exclusive

12

jurisdiction right of the United States to this area under the

13

Forts and Dockyards clause of the constitution.

24
25

Q

When was that; 1940?

A

1953.

Q

That's the first time it has occurred?

A

That's right, Your Honor.

Whathappened here was

that the United States first acquired title and only years
later, in 1953 did the State of Maryland cede jurisdiction and
thus vest inthe United States, the exclusive jurisdiction
claimed under Clause 17, Article 6 —
Q

Was there any objection raised by Maryland?

A

Mo, they did not.

TheState

ofMaryland

Voluntarily?

A

Yes; voluntarily,

2

Do you think that the Congress of the United

States could pass a lav? permitting, giving these people the

4

right to vote in Federal elections?

Yes, 5four Honor; I believe the United States

could do that.

The contention of the state --

Why wouldn't that really be enough?

Xf they

the enclave, why wouldn't that give them all they need

10

with reference to voting, if they got it fromthe government,

11

which has the enclavs.

12
13

A

Your Honor, the United States, however

— the

Congress of the Unitod States has not done so and —

14

Q

Well, they could, couldn't they?

15

A

Oh, yes? they could.

16

Q

Are you as clear about that as — the reason I

17

asked the question is because I first thought thett probably

18

there was no doubt about it, and then X started to think about

19

it and I'm not sure about it.

20

A

Mr. Justice, as far as the House of Representa­

21

tives is concerned, I believe that this particular right could

22

be said to be vested in the Congress ofthe United States.

23

would not be the case, perhaps, with regard to other

This

24

Q

That's not the case in the Senate?

25

A

X would sety it vrould be a more difficult issue
25

1

in that case.

2

it would be most ei€;ar.
Q

3
4

You would not ask the Congress for the franchise

for these residents to vote in state elections?
A

5
6

I think throughout the House of Representatives

Mo? certainly not.

And that, therefore, can

only be done by asserting their right under the 14th Amendment.
The position of the State of Maryland is basically

7

8

that we are dealing here with a geographic area which is not

9

part of the State of Maryland, the doctrine of extraterritor­

10

iality r which was first enunciated by the State Courts in the

25

19th Century, particularly by the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts in 1841 in the opinion of the justices, and
thereafter in Sinks versus Reese, 1869 by the Supreme Court of
Ohio.
It is very significant to note that in both instances
in the case of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts, again the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio
a great deal of emphasis was placed on the fact that the
residents of the enclave as they existed then had no Obligations
whatever toward the states in question; Massachusetts and Ohio.
And both courts placed-the thrust of the decisions of both of
these courts was that because there was no obligation owed by
an enclave resident to the state, it was for that reason that
there was no concurrence or no right arising out of it, to vote
in that particular state.
26

1

As the District Court, three-judge court in this

2

particular case, pointed out, the situation was abruptly

3

changed when the Federal Government in the late 1920s and

4

30s enacted a series of statutes which in effect, extended the

5

jurisdiction of the State of Maryland over the enclave and

6

enclave residents for practically all purposes, other than

7

criminal jurisdiction.

8

And this is really what we are down to.

It is only

9

as far as the enforcement of the criminal laws are concerned,

10

that there is a continuing exclusive authority vested in the

United States Government.

All the rest of it, in terms of the

daily lives of the residents of the enclaves, we are dealing
with people who are, in every other way, subject to the laws
and duties of citisens of Maryland.
Q

How could they enforce a law with reference to

speeding in the enclave, for instance?
A

It would have to be done, Mr. Justice, by the

— in the United States courts, by the commissioners.
Q

By what?

A

By the United States Commissioners.

In other

words, the speeding law would be enforced •—
Q

well, what control does Maryland have over the

enclave and you said criminally; now, what does that include?,
A

Taxation, as far as all taxes to which these

people would be subject if they were not living on the enclave.
27

1

Q

In other words, income tax?

That’s right? income tax, sales tax, motor

vehicle tax.

ofoffleers.
A

8

That’s right.

As a matter of fact, Your Honor,

7

I wish to point out that what we are dealing with here is a

8

situation in which the plaintiffs are deprived of the right to

9

vote for all offices, from Presidentof the United States on

10

down to local members of the board of education.

11

of these offices, save one, these residents have a very deep

interest.

County.

The

record points out that quite a number of the plaintiffs are
28

t

members of the P„T.A. of Montgomery County, and that in every

a

other way they are a part of the Montgomery community.

s

I wish to point out that prior to 1953 the issue, as

4

to whether they are or are not members of the Montgomery County

5

community, could not even have been raised.

6

the state law, ceding jurisdiction in 1953 simply drew a line

7

along Wisconsin Avenue and Old Georgetown Road, which said,

8

"From here on in there shall be no criminal jurisdiction by the

State of Maryland over this particular area."

It was simply that

Was there a state law

or anything like that?
A

What happened was the following:

In •— the

residents of another enclave in Cecil County, Maryland, had been
prevented by the Board of Supervisors of Elections of their
county from voting.

They went into the Maryland courts and in

1963 the Maryland Court of Appeals in the Royer case, cited in
the brief, decided againstthem.
29

What enclave was that?

That was Perry Point Naval Hospital — Veterans

Hospital at Perry Point in Cecil County.

Q

How many voters there, I wonder.

A

Probably a small number.

Q

Not fromthe size of that installation; that’s a

huge place.

9

A

10

Two-hundred-and-fifty, I am told.

It took, Mr. Justice, about five years before the news

11

of the Royer case somehow got down to the Board of

12

Election Supervisors of Montgomery County and beginning early

13

in 1968 they decided to turn people down if they fci'ied to

14

register to vote, from people who were residents of the NIH

15

enclave and in the months following, when the point —-

I assume Maryland has not objected to their

18

A

all along.

20

Q

Has there been any effort, political effort, in

21

the State Legislature, to get a state law giving these people

As to why the legislation is not going through.

I believe the delegationof Ann Arundel County has

Difficulty as to what?

some doubts about military installations in that particular
county.
Q

You mean they didn’t want them?

A

That’s right; I believe that's the case.

Q

They didn’t want them voting.

A

They didn't want the installation —

Q

They wanted the military installations, but they

didn’t want them voting.
A

Yes.

I do want to emphasize in this connection,

however, that —•
Q

Did I understand you to say they Wc

'd the

installation but didn’t want them to vote?
A

at*s right; we’re dealing with, among other

things, the Naval Academy, Your Honor.
Q

They didn't want it in Maryland?

A

They would not want the residents of these

military installations to be voting in Anne Arundel County;
that is my understanding.
Q

Has there ever been any objection to the
31

1

installations being there?

2

A

I don't think so.

I do want to emphasise —

3

Q

I suppose the theory behind that is that they

4

are people without a permanent attachment to the State of

5

MarylandA

6
7
8

press home here, is that that is not the point that we are
making.
The State of Maryland retains the full power to define

9
10
11

residence in terms of the bona fideness of a particular person
living in a particular localtiy.
In the case, of Annapolis, for example, the State of

12

13
14
15

IS
17
18
19

20
21

22

Mr» Justice, the issue that I would like to

Maryland could perfectlywell hold that a midshipman entering
the academy for four years is not a bona fide resident of
Maryland.

However, a member of the faculty who has, plans to

spend his entire life there, and lives on the enclave, should
be considered a permanent resident of Maryland,
The same is. true at Fort Meade.

Somebody who is there

on a temporary tour of duty can be very we11 denied the right
to vote, but somebody who, again, is part of the permanent
cadre should have a right to vote inthe State of Maryland.
So, the distinction can still be made that the issue
that is raised here is whether a person living in a particular

23
24
25

locality and planning to live there for the rest of his life,
should be deprived forever of his right to vote as long as he
32

1

chooses to live at that particular locality, even though he

a

is paying taxes to the state and is* as the Court below pointed

3

out* also subject to the criminal laws of the state through

4

the Assimilated Crimes Act,
The only issue* the only point of distinction as I

5

6

mentioned before* is. the point of distinction with regard to

7

the enforcement of the criminal laws.
And, to return to Mr, Justice Harlan's question, I

8
9

would say that if the state wouldprovide that residents of the

10

enclave may not vote for State's Attorney of Montgomery County,

11

1 would say that there would be a rational reason for depriving

12

them of that right to vote, because the State's Attorney of

13

Montgomery County, does, indeed, have no jurisdiction over the

14

enclave.

15

residents may not vcte under the theory of the state, is a

16

person in whom whose services _they have a vital interest.

17

But every other officer of government for whom these

Mow, I understand that the State's Attorney is

18

the only officer without, at least some, if not complete juris-

19

diction over these would-be voters.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Why doesn’t he, under the

Assimilated Crimes Act he does not?
A

No; be does not.

Q

I mean, if there is a robberv or a murder or a

rape or a criminal assault and battery the state substantive
law applies under the Assimilated Crimes Act.

With regard to the basic question of whether the
absence of criminal jurisdiction can deprive a voter, a
resident of a particular locality of the right to vote at his
place of residence, I would like to direct the attention of the
35

1

Court to the analogy in the cases involving the American

2

Indians who* though they live on Indian reservations, are —•

3

and are not -under the criminal jurisdiction of the states in

4

most instances, do have the right to vote under the various

decisions of the State Supreme Courts since 1948.

over the people living on the reservation, the right fcovote

Can those who enforce those laws, come

I would assume, Mr. Justice, they cannot.

would have to proceed through the United States Attorney,
Q

Why would that be?

A

I believe that this is inherent in the right of

— in the fact that the United States starts out with exclusive
jurisdiction.

So you are saying, civilly, too, then, that

enforcement proceedings of any kind, of Maryland’s laws, civil

or criminal, are in the hands of the United States Attorney?

Civil proceedings, I would assume, could be

initiated in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Maryland.

But you couldn’t come and take somebody's car

No.

I understand from the Appellant’s brief that

This, as I pointed out, Mr. Justice, is a

circular argument.

I suppose we are dealing, in that particular

It may very well be true.

To sum up, may I point out that in terms of the real

factors involving people’s lives on a day-to-day basis, we are

13

dealing here, fundamentally with the point that the residents

14

of enclaves pay the taxes that all other residents of Maryland

15

in similar situations pay and are subject to the same laws that

16

other residents of the State of Maryland are in terms of the

deprived of the opportunity
