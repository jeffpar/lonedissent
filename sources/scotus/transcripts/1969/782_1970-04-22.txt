ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. FISHER;

May it please the Court;

7

My name is Robert Fisher.

I represent a class of

8

plaintiff appellants.

3

who are incarcerated in the Baltimore City Jail, and we have

The class is defined as those people

10

defined it as a continuing class.

We brought this action in

11

July of 1968, and there are currently about 150 people in

12

the Baltimore City Jail under this statute that we are attack­

13

ing.
This case is different from the Williams Case that

14
15

the Court has just heard in that there only an unusual appli­

16

cation of the jail or fine statute was bcaing contested ~ the

17

situation where the judge gives both the maximum jail sentence

18

and a fine and a person is required to serve more than the

13

maximum amount allowed.
Our case covers ail types of incarceration for non­

20

payment of fines, except the contumacious refusal to

22

situation.

25

We are not concerned with that.

a $2 rate instead of a $5 rate.

pay

Our case involves

It is a mandatory rate which

the statute says the judge shall commit him and then pursuant
to the terms of the statute, the statute provides a $2 rate.

1

Q

Two dollara per day?

2

A

Two dollars per day.

3

Q

Your statute has been substantially amended?

4

I expect you are going to tell us about that in due course.
A

3

That is right, Your Honor.

The new statute

6

should be in force, but it is not.

I called the Chief Judge

7

of the Municipal Court of Baltimore yesterday, and he said he

8

had never heard of the nev; statute.

9

a copy, which I did.

He asked me to send him

I called the jail, and they said that

10

they had not heard of the new statute; that nobody was getting

11

out under it.

n

The new statute, by the way, just gives a judicial

13

remedy.

It does not say that everybody who was committed under

14

the old statute should get out.

15

to apply to the justice that committed them for redetermination

16

under -the new statute, and it does not guarantee that they will

17

get out.

It only gives them a right

18

Q

It gives judicial --- Excuse me.

13

Q

I was just going to ask does it have a daily rate?

20

The new statute?

23

A

It has a minimum rate of $10 per day.

22

Q

So it gives potential judicial remedy to those

23
24
25

now in jail, and it also, for the future, sets up

You are right, Your Honor, it gives a potential

remedy, but it doesn’t require

that they be notified of the

existence of the remedy.

And if the Chief Judge of the

Court doesn't know about it a week after it was

4

Q

5

A

Well, he knows now; you told him.
how are people that are locked up in jail,

6

where they don’t have television or newspapers or radios,

7

supposed to find out about it?

8

Q

Is the new statute part of your papers?

9

A

No, it is not. Your Honor, but it is substan­

10

tially the same as a copy that was printed in the brief of

11

the state conceding jurisdiction, and, in addition. City

12

Solicitor Russell has sent, 1* understand, copies of the new

13

statute to the Court.

14

Q

15

Does this ca.se. involve offenses for which a fine

only is provided?

13

A

Yes, it doss, Your Honor, traffic offenses.

17

Q

This does involve the traffic offense that we

18
19

■were talking about previously?
A

That is right.

I am aware of the colloquy before

20

me, and I notice that the Attorney General of Illinois said

21

that it would be disastrous, because there would be no way to

22

compel people to pay traffic fines.

There is a very good way

And there are

Let me explain how we got here — I have very little

2

time — and then maybe I could start off with my argument on

3

the equal protection? due process? cruel and unusual punishment?

4

excessive fines? and involuntary servitude when we come back

3

after lunch.

8

We commenced this action under 42 United States Cods

1

983 for an injunction of the Warden of the Baltimore City Jail

8

to restrain him from holding people unconstitutionally

9

detained and for a declaratory judgment that the statute is

10

unconstitutional on its face.
The district court held that the statute was constitu­

1.3

in two respects.

Where I left off, Your Honor, was the

decision of the three-judge district court.

Maryland $2 a day statute as constitutional on its face.

It upheld the
But

10

it held that in each case the sentencing judge had to hold a

11

hearing to allow persons being commited to tell the judge

12

about their indigency and give him an opportunity to decide

13

whether or not to reduce the fine, or to put them on probation,

14

or to allow them to pay in installments, or to commit them.
I also held that, as the statute was being applied

with respects to costs at that particular time, the statute
was unconstitutional, because the people were not being jailed

18

for costs in all cases, but they were in some cases.

We have appealed from this decision 'under the
authority of article 28, section 1253.

Our basic contention

in this Court boils down really to one premise, and that is

I

1

that one 24 hour day in jail with all that that entails in

2

terms of the stigma in the community and the fact that

3

the man may lose his job, the fact that the man may be sub­

4

jected to the unpleasant experiences of the jail — one 24

5

hour day in jail does not equal $2.

6

The poor man is being punished more severely than

7

the rich man if the rich man pays $2 and the poor man goes to

8

jail for a 24 hour day.

9

that is so fundamental that it is written in stone on the

We submit that this goes to an issue

front of this Courthouse, "Equal Justice Under Law."
Q

11

How far would that argument go?

Let's assume

12

a §10 fine on a person and that all that person possessed in

13

the world was §10, as compared to a §10 fine on a person who

14

had a million dollars.

15

wouldn't it, under your standard?

A

16

That would be unequal protection,

The way our society looks at a. man who has paid

17

a fine is different than the way our society looks at a man

18

who has gone to jail.

The man who has paid a fine is somebody who might have got a

traffic ticket.

Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the

Courts
My brother is correct.

The first argument I

intend

to make is that this case is moot in light of the statute
recently passed by the Maryland Legislature as an emergency
bill entitled? Chapter 147? and it was signed by Governor
Mandei on the 15th of April.
This statute under section S is retroactive in its
application? and? therefore? the appellants? or the plaintiffs?
16

It provides that any

1

in this case may take advantage of it.

2

person incarcerated for dafav.lt of payment of a fine may apply

3

for a hearing or, by general order of the court, may have a

4

hearing on his indigency status.
The court, after conducting an inquiry, if it finds

5
6

that this individual is unable to pay the fine, immediately,

7

the court may provide installment payments.

8

that installment, payments are not feasible under the circum-

9

stances, it then may offer to the defendant substitute punish­

If -the court finds

ment.
And this is the theory under which Maryland has enact-

12

ed its legislations

13

tive punishment appropriately imposed upon a defendant upon

As a matter of fact, the Court in Strattman

And I am .not suggesting that he be

I am suggesting — the bast thing to do is to do what

And that can be done.

Your Honor asked a question in the previous argument

13

about whether the new statute would be counter-productive,

17

whether a judge would start sending people to jail.

I think

18

we have to assume that judges will act the way judges are supp­

19

osed to act and keep the blindfold on as far as a person’s

20

poverty is concerned, and that they will sentence people fairly

21

and judicially, even though they may, under some new scheme,

22

not be able to send them to jail for nonpayment of a fine.

23
24
25

So I don't think — I see ray time is up — I don't think that
it will be counter-productive.
Q

Are you saying that all punishments of money
35

are necessarily void because there is denial of equal protection

of the law?

A

Oh, no. Your Honor*

money.

There are a number of different ways that the State of

1?
18

Well, it requires a pretty good amount of wisdom,

doesn’t it, to determine what you will do in these cases?
A

19

These are tremendous problems, and they do

20

require a great deal of wisdom, but -the foundation that that

21

wisdom ought to be built on is the principle that is even

22

older 'than the jail-or-fine statute; that the law looks at

23

the man without regard to his status in the community.

Would the law be invalid only as applied to an

You have a situation where you claim -that the

law is invalid, either as applied or on its face.

That is correct.

Now if it is invalid on its face, invalid

state provide for punishment by money fines?

Then, in the

A

When the Chief Justice asked his question, 1

that here, because the $2 rate is unequal in any event.

How would we decide what

A

I don’t know, Your honor.

If you had to decide

12

that question — I think you can decide what is not enough,

13

especially, when the purpose of the state statute is to make

14

an unequal punishment in order to collect the money from

15

people that can pay.

16

never heard anybody suggest to me that $2 is equal to 24 hours?

17

nobody has actually asserted that to me.

You could decide that easily. And I have

Suppose they made it $10?

Well, my position is that $10 is still not

If you just decided that, that would only settle

It wouldn’t settle the deep problem that was

raised between you gentlemen?
A

No; but it would settle the other case if you

went further -chan I have asked you to go and reached the basic

value judgment that jail and money cannot be equated.

would settle all of that.

I do not understand that.

That is probably true.
