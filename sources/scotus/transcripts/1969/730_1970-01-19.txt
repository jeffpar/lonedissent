MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

the State of California.
Mr. Amato, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH AMATO, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. AMATO:

Honorable Chief Justice, Mr. Associate

8

Justices, this is another case that we have here in a long

9

history of cases that the United States Supreme Court has

10

decided in the past regarding the Fourth Amendment to the

11

United States Constitution.

12

That amendment reads as follows, "The right of the

13

people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and

14
15

effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not
/
be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probab’e

16

cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly de. I

17

scribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things

18

to be seized."

19

Certainly this Court has treated the rights of the pri­

20

vate citizen in the past with great emphasis.

21

United States has held that a search based upon reasonable cause

22

is allowed incidental to arrest providing that that search is

23

reasonable.

24
25

Weeks

vsl

Before we go into a long facts situation of this parti­
cular case, I think it should be pointed out that the petitioner
1

1

in this case is alleging that his particular arrest, which was

2

an invalid arrest, and then subsequently the police went on with

3

an unreasonable search, that this was a violation to his Fourth

4

Amendment rights even prior to this Court’s decision last year

5

in People v. Chime1.

6

Certainly in this particular case the Petitioner

7

appealed and opposed all information and all evidence regarding

8

that particular case, at the trial level, the court of appeal,

9

at the supreme court and now here before the United States

10
11

Supreme Court.
The particular trial court at the time they were rul­

12

ing on the evidence, particularly the diary which is really

13

the relevant issue in this particular case because without the

14

diary the evidence is insufficient to convict the particular

15

petitioner.

16

admissibility of the particular evidence and the diary that

17

the trial judge made a statement that a ruling to the prosecu­

18

tion would open Pandora's box to the particular evidence that

19

was included in this particular case.

20

That at the time the trial judge ruled upon the

IJhat the trial court meant at that time was not that

21

this factual situation would open the court but this would open

22

such a vast exception to what this Court has ruled in the past

23

it would in effect allox* an arrest, an arrest that was not a

24

valid arrest, it was the arrest of a mistaken person and then

25

to go from that arrest on to search the premises, to search

2

2

:he fruits of the particular crime that the police were search-

The court of appeal after taking it under ~—

5

Q

6

*nd this case?
A

7

8

Supposing Chimel is carried backwards, does that
Does this satisfy Chimel?
Yes, Your Honor , I believe without question

hat this comes within the rule of Chimel that ——

9

Q

You mean it is invalid under Chimel?

10

A

Invalid under Chimel, yes, Your Honor.

31

I don’t believe that this is the big issue in this

12

articular case although I am sure the Court has granted certior-

13

ri on the basis of Chimel and the decision on whether to make

14

t retroactive or not.
The Petitioner in this particular case had this go on

15
16

he court of appeal.

17

ased upon the law of Rabinowitz and Harris, and then the Supreme

18

ourt of California affirmed

19

wo cases as guidelines.

the conviction using those same

It would seem, based on the factual situation in this

20
21

The Court of Appeal of California reversed

ase, that what we have here is the Petitioner absent from his
esidence.

The police finding information out from co-companions

his case as the Court is aware of involved four individuals
robbing a particular house and then two of those individuals
shortly thereafter, a day or two thereafter,

3

was captured by

1

the police on an unrelated crime, the possession of marihuana.

2

The police at that time had information from those

3

particular police officers and the victims of the robbery it­

4

self, also a bystander.
So, it is not the pstitioner's contention that there was

5
6

not reasonable cause to arrest Hill, clearly there was, but it

7

is the petitioner's contention that the rights of privacy that

8

this Court has constantly held is the rights of privacy of the

9

house and not. the fact that reasonable cause allowed a mistaken

10

arrest to then give effect an authority to an unreasonable

11

search.

52

First of all, the arrest itself was made, the petitionor

13

contends, in debatably good faith.

There were four officers in

14

this case, two of them carrying shotguns enter into the office

15

of Hill, I should say the apartment of Hill.

16

Miller answered the particular door and immediately thereafter

17

the officers arrested Miller.

Hiller was there.

18

Miller stated that he was net Mi Her nor gave identifi­

19

cation showing that he was not Miller and then when the officers

20

asked whether or not Miller knew where Hill was Miller replied

21

"No, that he did not know where Hill was."

22

Q

I am not sure of the significance of his dis­

23

avowal or his claim that he was Miller and not Hill.

24

not unusual for people engaged in this kind of business to

25

carry false identity cards and a lot of other things, is that
4

That is

1

not so?

2

A

That is correct, Your Honor, but I think from

3

the standpoint when you take all of these factors, the fact

4

that there was a couple of inches in discrepancy in the height,

5

10 pounds in the weight, the fact that he said that he was

6

Miller and that he was in Hill's apartment that at this parti­

7

cular point in time he showed identification that he was Miller.

8

There is no information that the officers had prior to going to

9

the residence of Hill that there was another person and there

10

was no indication that Miller knew that the officers were coming

11

in there, or Hill.

12

So the officers, and I think the case cited in the

33

Friend of the Court Brief shows that the. officers are required

14

to use diligence and prudence when they arrest a particular

15

person.
Most of these cases hold that when a person or an

16

17

officer does not use diligence that it in fact is a bad-faith

18

arrest.

19

Brief, it even held that particular officer liable in damages

20

for the amount of $1,500, and in that particular dissenting

21

opinion, and I am referring to Walton v. Will, 66 Cal. App. 2d

22

509, the dissenting opinion stated that in all respects the

23

description of the accused was either identical with or closely

24

approximated that of respondent.

25

In one particular case cited by the Friendof the Court

That was a particular "same name" case.
5

In this

■i

situation the names were not the same at all Archie -----

2

Q

We do have express findings by the state courts

3

that the officers fchoudfrrois taken in their identification acted

4

in good faith, don’t we?

5

A

Yes, Your Honor.

6

Q

So von have to start from that premise, your

1

argument has to start from that premise, doesn’t it?

8

A

Well, I think it starts from that premise.

9

Q

You are not asking us to upset those findings?

10

A

That is correct, Your Honor, but I think in all

II

these particular search and seizure cases all the facts are

12

important.
This initial arrest should also be considered in light

13
14

of the total search itself which petitioner contends is un­

15

reasonable .
Then we go on to the search itself.

16

The search was

17

directed toward the bedroom, the material search, where it

18

disclosed a particular diary and some other funits of the search.

19

The diary is the area petitioner contends

20

unreasonable as far as the search is concerned and :.hat it is

21

totally inconsistent with Rabinowitz, with Harris or any other

22

cases that this particular Court has decided.
First of all, the officers had no way of getting a

23
24

25

is totally

search warrant based upon the information they had regarding the
diary.

The fact that they were able to search that particxilar
6

residence and assuming they are allowed to search the drawers

?
and rummage through the particular dresser drawers, this Court

2
has always stated in the past that because you have a lawful
3
search doesnct necessarily mean that you have a right to seize.
4
In the Respondent's Brief, there is indicated that
5
fchye came across this particular diary in the search for their

6
other items, and we are tallying about cameras, we are talking

1
about clothes of certain types that the particular suspects wore

8
during the commission of the robbery.
9
Even in People v. Harris, which is probably the most

10
liberal decision allowing the police to search,

this Court held

11
that not in all cases will they allow such an extensive search.

12
Certainly in Harris they were looking for checks, two-

13
$10,000 checks.

And by the nature of the search, the nature of

14
the things that they were looking for, it would require looking
15
into a particular drawer or books or personal belongings, but
16
what information the officers had in this particular case did
17
not require that type of search.
18
If in fact they did, and it is concluded by this Court
19
that they made a reasonable search, then it is submitted by the

20
petitioner that there was an unlawful seizure.

21
In Boyd v. United States, it is held that an unlawful

22
search or an unlawful seizure are not dependent upon each other.
23
So certainly the petitioner is strongly contending
24
for that one item alone that it was an unreasonable search and
25
seizure.
-

7

-

1

2

Q

And that is proceeding on the premise that there

was probable cause to make an arrest?

3

A

Your Honor, we assume ——

4

Q

Of Hill.

5

A

Yes, Your Honor.

6

I don't believe that there is any question.

We have

7

not raised issues that we do not think are extremely material

8

and relevant or straw issues, so to speak.

9

We have raised issues relative to the arrest itself

10

and the seizure itself, and certainly we wanted the arrest it­

11

self, the fact that it wasn't the person that the officers were

12

there to make sure that all of the circumstances of the case

13

were before the Court.

14

Certainly it doesn't need dwelling on that Rabino-

15

witz and Harris, which the California Supreme Court relied on

16

to affirm the conviction of the petitioner, is totally different

17

from the facts situation in this case.

18

I have indicated this in my particular brief and I

19

don’t believe it needs elaboration on at this time, but we are

20

emphasising at this time that there is really no degree of con­

21

sistency with the fact situation and the application of the

22

Fourth /amendment in that case as compared to the case at Bar.

*

23

I would like to go to the second point and that is to

24

the determination of whether or not this Court will make Chimel

25

— People v. Chime1 retroactive or not.
8

In this particular case, I think it directly comes
1

2
3
4
5

into play, another pe.rt, another exception, another error on the
part of the prosecution to press their case.

I think it is

another area that this Court could reverse in addition to
the very initial contention that Petitioner has made.
That is the: fact that Chimel, People v. Chime 1, decid­

6
ed last year,clearly limits the police to search a particular
7
residence.

While many questions have been raised as to how far

8
the police are allowed to search, certainly in this instance
9
where the particular arrest was made in the living room, al­
10

though this Court has decided that that is not a material
11
fact, then the search was made beyond the immediate scope of

12
the particular Petitioner that, and I quote Petitioner because
13
in fact he was not even present that the arrest could not, or
14
search could not pursue into the living room, into drawers and

15
in fact a general and exploratory search to find evidence of the
16
crime.

17
Q

How big was this apartment?

A

The apartment was a one-bedroom, kitchen and

18
19
small living room apartment, a four-room apartment.
20
Q

Four-room apartment including the kitchen and

21

Miller was in the living room, was he, when the police came in?

22
A

Yes, Your Honor, Miller was lying on the couch

23
when the four policemen came he went to the door and was immedi­

24
ately arrested at that point.
25
9

1

2

Q

And the diary was found in the drawer of a desk cr

of a closet or of a bureau of something in what room?

3

A

It was found in the bedroom in a small drawer.

4

Q

In the bedroom.

5

Q

Now, insofar as retroactivity on this particular

6

case, certainly this Court has decided that it depends on a

7

case-case basis depending on the law, the actual effect it will

8

have on the administration of justice and whether or not it

9

will serve to a good effect on the past conduct of the Courts.

10

Now, it is contended that the administration of jus­

11

tice will be strongly effected as a result of making Chimel

12

retroactive.

13

fact, be the case, that the Courts are extremely flexible that in

14

the past time and time again the courts on major counties have

15
16
17
18
19

The Petitioner contends that this will not, in

been able to take some of their civil judges and utilize them
for criminal matters.
This happens on occasion even if — when there is no
strong decision from this Court changing the particular law.
The Petitioner strongly contends that making Chimel

20

retroactive will not have that great of an effect on the particu-

2!

HirctiF administration of justice from the standpoint of having a

22

lot of criminals who have been unconstitutionally convicted of

23

being released.

24
25

Petitioner has contended in his Reply Brief that surely
the appeals that are pending now could easily effect the law as
10

1

2

Court has enunciated it in People v. Chimel.
It seems appropriate that when you review the cases

3

regarding this particular problem in Alaska's Supreme Court,

4

the Court of Appeals of Hew Mexico that these cases have applied

5

Chimel on direct appeals only, and then when you review the

6

cases, you also see that they apply to these particular cases

7

without opinion.

3
9

When the cases are not utilizing Chimel on direct
appeal, they seem to state what this Court has stated in

io-

Stoval v. California and the Desist case setting forth the

ii

free criteria that this Court strongly considers in their

12

determination of whether or not a case in criminal law should

13

be made retroactive or not.

14

The Courts, in fact, have just come to a conclusion

15

that when there is a constitutional finding before them that

16

they review the facts of the law as it is in that pending appeal

17

It doesn’t have to be satisfied with the law of

18

opinion or justification, but that, in fact, it seems reasonable

19

to those particular judges that this case should be made as the

20

law is stated by this Court and not set some date back when a

21

particular case and arrest was made two to three years ago and

22

have all those particular arrests then based upon whether or not

23

it was constitutional or not constitutional.

24
25

It is immaterial because the date of the arrest of
Chimel, the date of the seizure — search and seizure is not the

11

1

sanis date as specified in the pending appeal.
This particular case was close to Chirael.

2

The petitic i-

3

er contended at the time

at the Court of Appeal that this was

4

not a case where the law of Rabinowitz and Harris,, and I am re­

5

ferring back to the first issue, if I may, was not constitution­

6

ally sanctioned search even at that time.
So certainly insofar as Chirael is concerned,which

7

8

far limits the courts -- far limits the courts in affirming the

9

rights of the police officers to search.
It would be submitted by this petitioner that Chimel

10
ii
12

should be made retroactive at least if the case is on direct
appeal.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. George?

15

ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GEORGE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

18
17
18
1.9

Thank you, Mr. Amato.

MR. GEORGE:

The sole issues in this case are whether

the search of petitioner's one-bedroom apartment was lawful
under then existing law, and secondly if the search was not
l
.

20
21

22
23
24
25

lawful under present law as defined by this Court’s decision
seven months ago in Chimel v. California, whether Chimel is to
be applied retroactively.
The factual setting in which the lawfulness of this
search arises is a rather unusual one, and I would, therefore,
chronicle it briefly.
12

i*

On June 4, 1966, a robbery involving a brutal assault
1

2

was committed by a gang of four armed men one of whom was
petitioner.

3
As part of a series of robberies committed by this
4

gang, or we can say which this gang was suspected, in a parti5

cular district in Los Angeles.
6

Two days later after this robbery in the evening the
7
police acquired probable cause to arrest petitioner.

This is

8
conceded by petitioner in this Court.

I won't dwell upon the

9

probable cause to arrest petitioner, that is clear and, as I
10

said, conceded.
11
The police then proceed to petitioner's apartment in
12

order to arrest petitioner and to retrieve the weapons used
13
in the assault and robberies and in order to retrieve the dis­
14

guises and stolen property.
15
In fact, this is done with the consent of one Bader,
16
who is one of the members of the gang.

Bader and one other man,

17
Baum, have been placed in custody and Bader is petitioner's
18
roommate.
19
The police knock and identify themselves and they are
20

confronted by somebody who later turns out to be Mr. Miller.
2!

Now Miller is the sole occupant of the apartment at this time.
22
He opens the door.

He looks almost identical to the petitioner.

23
In fact, the discrepancies are almost negligible, brown hair,
24

brown yees, almost the same height and weight.
25
13

In fact,

!

petitioner was two inches shorter, 5“10" instead of 6s, and he

2

was 10 pounds lighter as well, but that is

3

crepancy and one that certainly isn't necessarily apparent to

4

the officers or one that need not be apparent,

5

6

Q

a

negligible dis­

That issue is foreclosed unless we are going to

review the findings of fact, isn't it?

7

A

I would think so, yes, because the trial court

8

and the court of appeal and the State Supreme Court all found

9

that the officers did act with good faith.

I know this Court

10

has stated that good faith is not a substitute for probable

11

cause, but, of course, there is no substitution here.

12

ample probable cause.

13

Q

14
15

16

There is

By good faith in this context you mean — you

submit that there was a finding by both of the courts in the
all three of the courts in the state that the officers
genuinely believed that Miller was Hill.

1?

A

Yes.

18

Q

Do I understand you correctly?

19

A

That is correct, yes,

20

There are many things that support this.

21

in addition to his almost identical physical description he

22

suspiciously and evasively denied having seen any guns in the

23

apartment.

24

25

This person

Yet, when the officers are standing outside the
apartment after the door has been opened, they see an automatic

14

1

and a loaded clip right on the coffee table in plain view»

2

The person denies being petitioner but he is unable

3

to give any satisfactory explanation for his presence in the

4

apartment.

5

his name to be Miller, but this doesn’t mean much to the arrest­

6

ing officer.

1

He says he has some kind of identification showing

As the Chief Justice noted, it is commonly known and

a

the trial court took judicial notice of the fact that many

9

criminals, at least in California, do carry false identification.

10

It is an easy thing to come by, and why should the officers

11

believe this identification when he had just lied about the gun,

12

not knowing there was a gun in plain view.
The small apartment was then searched incident to this

13
14

valid but mistaken arrest of Miller and -—

15

Q

What were they searching for?

16

A

Theywere

searching for the weapons which they

17

had been told would bs at the apartment, the weapons used in

18

this crime and disguises which they had heard were there and

19

presumably soma of the stolen property as well which they had

20

reason to believe were there,

21

Q

22

A

The diary was just a windfall.
That is correct.

They had no idea, and it is not

23

even suggested that anybody had any idea there was such a diary,

24

I don't think it is something that we would assume a person would

25

write,

"Dear Diary, Yesterday I committed a crime."
-

15

i

2

Q

If you by any chance had gone for a search warran

you wouldn't have been able to mention the diary, would you?

3

A

4

Q

3

A

Well, what would have happened, we would subraitWould you?
Well, I will answer that.

I think that one could

6

have obtained this diary with a search warrant in the following

7

way, by searching for weapons, for looking for weapons in a

8

place where weapons might logically be, a bedroom, a dresser

9

drawer, opening up the drawer, seeing the diary

open to that

10

current page and then going to use that information lawfully

11

acquired to go get a search warrant.

12

20

22
23
24
25

Q

I'Jhat about

the constitutional requirement to

specify what you are searching for and where you search?
A

Yes.

Q

Is that gone?

A

That is not gone.

The officers would have acquire d

information lawfully by being where they had a right to be in
a place where they might find weapons.
Q

You still will agree, will you not, that you woulc

ba a little better off if you had a search warrant, just a little
bit better off?
A

We would be better off, but, of course, that was

not the lav; at the time,and we have an alternate argument that,
even under current law, there were exigent circumstances here
which would have not required the officers to obtain a search
16

1

warrant.

2

Q

What wore the exigent circumstances?

3

A

The exigent circumstances were as follows, the

4

officers had two suspects of the four robbery gang members in

5

custody»

6

committed.

No.

I will give the chronicle, if Your Honor

pleases.
On June 4th, the robbery was committed at 10:30 p.m.

that is a Saturday night.

The same evening?

21

A

The same evening.

22

Now, there were two members of the gang at large.

23
24
25

We

submit that the officers did not have to wait and worry about
these fellows committing other crimes^ Also, there was a distinct
possibility that petitioner would learn of the fact that two

1

of the members of the gang had been taken into custody and would

remove these weapons from the apartment»

3

Finally, one could say, well, why didn’t they go ahead

4

and seise petitioner, arrest him, and then the next day go back

5

with a search warrant»

6

Well, we have this fourth member of the gang, Baca,

7

who was still at large, and he might be alerted by the fact

8

that these three members were placed in custody and might re­

9

move the property before a search warrant could be obtained.

10

This is not the type of situation that Chimel criti­

1!

cizes where the officers routinely, as a matter of course,

12

dispensed with the requirement of a search warrant.

13

itself, is replete with language recognizing that there are

20

law.

21

Q

In turn, I feel

Suppose it were retroactive, why do you say the

22

search was reasonable?

23

A

Because the officers were confronted with a

24

situation where time was of the essence, this gang was going

25

around assaulting and robbing people, the evidence might be
18

removed from the apartment if the other members of the gang at

large were apprised of the fact that some of their members had

been arrested.

It is pretty clear that they all had access to this

Mr. George, directing your attention to page

There was no telling him and then

telling him again.

IS
Q

Well how in the world did the Supreme Court of

16
California make this mistake?
17
A

Well, as this Court has found previously, they

18
are not infallible, and I submit that this is a mistake on
19
their part.
20
Q

Occasionally this Court makes factual errors in

21
its opinions, too.
22
A

Yes.

But I just last night looked over this and

23
I read the entire record carefully including the state court
24
record, and it is clear that this officer spoke only once to
25
Bader and Baum and that was the only information he had from
i

i

1

them that he acquired at 5:30 on June the 6th.

2

I think these state findings are entitled to great

3

weight where they are supported by the evidence especially re­

4

garding the good faith of the officers here.
I think, too, the fact of judicial notice where the

5

6

Court can consider as evidence these facts of common knowledge

7

that false identification is being carried and that although the

a

man wets booked under this different name that in California you

9

are booked under the name you give.

10

So clearly the officers did

consider riiller to be Hill.
Now, I think, we gat to the heart of the case here.

We assume it is a valid arrest.

and I don’t think there is any basic limitation on that.

z

think the mere evidence rule being rejected in Warden v* Hayden

3

eliminates these distinctions where we worry about one piece of

paper which in one case may be a so-called instrumentality by

5

the Court reaching strained application of that doctrine to

save it from a mare evidence rule.

I think you can certainly look inside envelopes under

pre-Chimel law.

that is not our situation here.

I don't think there is any problem, but, again,
The officers are looking only

Now, basically what, the petitioner is relying on here

12

in his attempt to persuade us

is an outmoded and totally inappropriate concept of property

law.

15

that the search is unreasonable

He is saying, well, fine, the arrest is all right, and

16

this defendant, here he had the control over the premises in the

sense of physical control.

18

could go run over to evidence, but he didn't have control in

19

a proprietary sense.

20

He could go and grab a weapon.

That is a totally inappropriate standard.

appropriate here.

4

Let's assume that Hiller was arrested in petitioner's

5

apartment but that petitioner was right there and the police

6

wanted to arrest Miller, that they knew he was visiting there.

7

Certainly even under Chimel the police could search the area

He has the

Is this risk being that your visitor, your

social guest, may be somebody whom the police are pursuing or

22

want to arrest for some reason or another and therefore are go­

23

ing to enter your house, and in the restricted search of your

24

guests they are going, to an extent, invade the privacy of your

25

house, is that the point?
24

!

A

Yes, exactly*

I think similarly if one gives

2

a key to ones apartment to somebody else or leaves the door un­

3

locked, one assumes certain risks.

Maybe a pursued felon will enter, and that is the situation here

Is there anything in the record to show that Hill

left Miller in the custody of the apartment?
A

Mo, there is nothing to show that, but he obvious

ly got in somehow.

20

Q

That is different from the duffle bag.

21

A

I think what is interesting is that absolutely

22

no defense was offered at the preliminary hearing or at the

23

trial, not one word of evidence to come forward and indicate

24

that this apartment had been locked or whatever, nothing at all.

25

Q

You mean that there was no claim that he was a
25

1

a trespasser

2

A

Pardon me.

3

Q

There is no claim by Hill that Miller was a tres­

5

A

There is no claim whatsoever.

6

Similarly I think that if Miller had

been arrested

7

in his own apartment, in Miller's apartment, and this had all

8

been a mistake, what would happen if the officers found marihuana

9

in Miller's pocket, let's say, or in the drawer.

I think it

10

would be clearly admissible against Miller despite the invasion

11

of his privacy, if it was a reasonable mistake to arrest Miller

12

and search his premises.

13

Q

You mean that if the word comes out that a 6',

14

200-pound blond man committed a crime that the police have the

15

right to go into anybody's apartment that fits that description?

16

Certainly you don't mean that.

17

A

No, and I didn't mean to imply that.

18

Q

I thought so.

19

A

But there is much more evidence here.

It would

20

have to be a reasonable mistake, and that is always going to

21

be a case-by-case basis.

We submit that Desist is the governable standard here.
Desist set forth the function of the three considerations, the
purpose to be served, the extent of reliance and the effect on
the administration of justice.

The memorandum which is attached to this letter of the

completely revise its procedures and place judges on call nights

7

Of course, an argument could be made which it

8

was suggested as 1 remember in Desist that at the time this

9

happened this was not any Federal violation of the constitution

10

even in the retrospective wisdom of Chimel because the consti­

11

tution itself prohibits only unreasonable searches and seizures.

I believe it was Your Honor in that

was the law.

And agents who rely on the decisions of the court;

can hardly said to be acting unreasonably.

17

A

Yes.

We certainly concur with that.

18

Q

I say that is kind of a circular argument, but

it is not lacking in realism either.

19

’■A

20

I think not in view of the particular wording

21

of the Fourth Amendment that searches are to be judged in lack

22

of their reasonableness, and that certainly must imply what the

23

law is at the time the searches are conducted.
I sea ray time is up, and that is all we have unless

24

there are any questions.

How far can you go?

Q

V?e don’t have to worry about that here, do we?

I believe you do, Your Honor, because

A

That part is true, Your Honor, but as far as

ow to the extent of the search, now, haw could you make a search
n a particular apartment of a diary when in fact even before
:hey went to that particular apartment they couldn’t have gotten

a search warrant.

the warrant in turn recited any books, papers and records re­

I think that is so general in nature, Your Honor,

13

that they would have to specify what type of books, what general

What in the constitution would require you to

That is why the general warrant has been out­

view?
3

I think it would

4

be justified from the standpoint of the parts that they set forth
5

for clarity and would extend to the diary which would be illegal.

6
In other words, if they brought in the diary, it would be in­
7

sufficient.

8
As far as the

other

evidence,it would be all

9

right as far as the Court is concerned.
10

Counsel brought out the fact that Bader who was in

!!
custody consented to the officers to go to the petitioner’s

12
apartment.

I think the California court, and it is stated

13

in my Reply Brief, that Bader who was held in custody does not
14

have the authority to strip the petitioner of all of

his

15

constitutional rights.

!6
Certainly because Bader said that he could go to that
17

particular apartment doesn’t mean that he can go ahead, the
18

officer can go ahead and search it and as far as the petitioner
19

contends an unreasonable search.

20
Now, this point about this Baca, B-A-C-C-A,

Bacca

21

was the third person who was not in custody, meaning two of

22
the defendants were in custody, but petitioner was not avail­
23

able.
24

So, the respondent says there is a very big emergency j
25

37

here, we can’t go back and get a search warrant.

2

Well, what is the emergency here?

What we are talking

about is four individuals.

Police officers, two with shotguns,
Now, we have, in fact, if the y
The

The fourth man has access to this

So, it would seem to me that if they wanted to get and
protect the particular goods that were in that apartment, to
search it more in detail at a later time, that the proper and
reasonable police procedure would be to have the officers stay
at the apartment to survey it, and if that fourth suspect comes
back,then they can make an arrest at that time.
It would see that it would be an asset to not search
the apartment rather than have to search it right away and be
fearful that this particular Bacca would come back and take the
goods from that particular apartment.
Insofar as this diary, and this is what the petitioner
is contending at this time, is completely unreasonable.

The

other items that were searched the petitioner contends it is
possible under Rabinowitz and Harris that these items may have
been able to have been searched and properly seized by the
officers.
Insofar as that particular diary is concerned, I think
it is the burden upon the prosecution when they are attempting

25
-

38

1

to make exceptions to the Fourth Amendment that the particular
officers show enough authority and enough diligence and prudence
to justify that particular search and to show it into evidence
and not have the petitioner show that he has the rights afforded
by the Fourth Amendment but rather have the prosecution show
the exceptions to the Fourth.
Q

Do you concede that everything about the search

was valid except the taking of the diary?
A

No, Your Honor, I concede only that it may have

10

possibly been.

11

seems so clear in reviewing the case decisions in Rabinowitz

12

and Harris and all the other decisions Weeks and Lefkowitz and

13

Gobard Company, and reviewing in light of Chimel, all these

14

cases make it so crystal to myself that the particular search

15

and seizure of the diary was improper.

16

Certainly this case regarding the diary to me

The most you can get, I think, is the search was valid.

17

The seizure is difficult to comprehend in light of the Court9s

18

decisions in the past.

19

Q

21

A

Do you claim that the thing siezed was not

Yes, Your Honor, I think that they were making

22
23

a general, exploratory search.
Q

I am not talking about the search.

You do not

24

assert, do you, that a diary which contains a confession that

25

a man was guilty of a crime is not relevant evidence against

t

him?
A

no question about it.
Q

it.

Suppose he saw a weapon exactly of the description which

0

was used to shoot a man, would you say they couldn't get that?
10

A

I would say, Your Honor, I think it depends on

11

the circumstances.

In the first instance, if the officers knew

12

or had reason or any evidence or any probable cause as this
13

Court has —
14

Q

Suppose they didn't have evidence but when they

15
looked at it they saw it was highly relevant.
16
A

Well, Your Honor, I say that they cannot seize

17

that particular evidence without a search warrant.
18

I have no further questions, Your Honor.

Thank you.
