ON 8EHAI3? OF PETITIONERS •
MR. COONEY:

This case is here on certiorari to the 8th Circuit|

Than!;; you.., Your Honor.

it is an income tax case involving the question of whether the (
i

cost of a stock appraisal proceeding held in connection wit}]

the extensi or. of a corporation's charter, are ordinary and
necessary expenses incurred for the production — excuse me,
ordinary and necessary expenses incurred for the management of
property held for the production of income and are, thus £.
deductible, or in the alternative: whether they are capital
expenditures paid relevant to the acquisition of title to
corporate stock and thus, nondeductible.
In other words, this Court is asked to characterise

18

19
£0
21

22
23
24

for income tax purposes, money spent by the taxpayers as
majority shareholders for professional services renederad in a
litigation arising under a sta$@ appraisal statute. wherein
the only issue in the equitable action was the real value and.
in some states it's fair value, of the dissenting shareholder’s
stock.
The character of this production so far as the

ZB
2

1

taxpayers maintain is to be determined under Section 212(2)

2

of the present Code*

3

"non-business deduction" section that was added, by the 1942

4

Revenue Act, which this Court in 1965 was called upon to

5

interpret in the Gilmore case.

-S-

This is the successor to the so-called

Mechanically, a Section 212(2) deduction would have

7

been taken on last year's income tax return; that would be the

8

one for 1968, on page 2 of 1040 under "Itemized deductions"

9

under the section entitled: "Miscellaneous.M This year under

I©

the new forms it would be a deduction on the schedule en­

'ii

titled "Itemized deductions" under miscellaneous deductions.

12

In this particular instance the taxpayers are

13

majority shareholders; the majority shareholders are people,

14

the petitioners.

15

This is otherwise in the companion case.

The factual situation involved herein was precipi­

16

tated and is completely controlled by the Iowa Renewal Statute

17

If you wish to refer to it at this particulartime, if you

18

will turn to page 23 of the Appendix there are excerpts of

19

the opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court, and the laot .pair a graph

2©

on that particular page contains the text of the statute.

23

This is a little bit different in most states.

way of apology, but Iowa’s corporate law leaves something to

23

be desired relative to speed in adopting changes.

holders, a three-way tie contract.
This is important,

13

the dissenting shareholder had not — I beg your pardon —

the unanimity of consent rule — in other words, this was a

18

the dissenting shareholder had entered the agreement, the

10

contract, the business venture, to go for 20 years.

20

could not be stopped: unless there was some reason relative to

21

it would be better for the investment to terminate it.

22

And it

Then, there is law that would indicate that you

23

could then, but she had agreed, everybody had agreed to go to

24

20 years, and this is what the Iowa statute has been from,

25

initially in 1851 to the middle of the decade of the 40's.
4

5

But that was just Immediately prior to the last renewal for

2

20 years of this corporation.

3

The context is Iowa Law? the taxpayers are residents

4

of Iowa; the corporation happens to be a newspaper corporation

that owns a radio station.

6

9

The taxpayers control approximately

70 percent of the shares of stock, the dissenter owned
approximately 30 percent.
The evidence shows that there hadn't been an offer
or a sale of the stock, at least to 1950.

That is, the

10

evidence in the valuation case, the petition of which in the

So, the corporate charter was due to run out in
December of 1931, having been renewed for a term of years in
December of 1941.

A meeting was held with notice duly given,

efc cetera, on June 9, 1960.

The dissenting shareholder voted

against a resolution to extend the corporation's charter.
Now, Iowa has adopted the statute which is shown on

would adopt majority rule, but they were concerned thatthey

would run smack into the due process clause, calling for the

We were advocating strenuously that the stock should

Now, those

two theories, of course, are always under the "fair market valuej
cases, general^ under the estate gift taxes.

1

But the Supreme Court of Iowa would have nothing to

2

do with that argument.

They said: BWhat is she entitled to if

3

she would have continued?

4

question arises: How axe these expenses to be determined?

That being true, of course, the

It is our understanding, the taxpayers * understanding

5

6

that there are two questions that are involved.

7

question is whether or not this is a personal expense of the

8

taxpayer or an expense that arises in a profit-seeking venture?
This Court’s case of Gilmore enumerated the test

that would come under 212 as a management expenditure relative

to property held, for the protection of income,.
It would seem, without, by just reviewing the factual
situation that this is not a personal expense; these are the
— this in a profit-seeking status» or venture or context.
The next test is whether or not the item, the expendi­

is to determine whetheror not a particular expenditure is? a

The first

ture is an expense that would be deductible or a capital ex­

give us appraisal rights, are generally considered sis accounting?

How, this Court inGilmore relied on its, for its

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

As the corporate charter which was involved here was

about to expire, the majority stockholders voted to extend the

«
j

charter and enlarge the cowers of the. corporation.
Mrs. Quigley, owned 379 share of the 1,200 outstanding
I
shares of the corporation. She voted against the extension and
'
enlargement of the corporate charter. With her having done that,
1

under the Iowa. Law the majority shareholders were required to
purchase her stock, and purchase it at its real value.

What did. the appraised value turn out to be?

In accordance with the Iowa law, they

The Tax Court affirmed that denial and the 8th Circuit affirmed
the Tax Court decision.
In determining whether the expenditures in this case

13
14

are deductible for Federal income tax purposes, we must look to

15

Section 212 and Section 263 and to some of the leading court

16

decisions.

Sedan 212 provides that an individual may take a
deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses incurred
during the taxable year for the management, protection and main­
tenance of property held for production of income.
This, of course, is a counterpart to Section 162,
which provides for deduction of the ordinary and necessary ex­
penses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.
Here we are concerned with the individual provision
'which is Section 212.

The Woodwards contend that Section 212 applies and

provides for deduction of these expenditures»

The Government,

on the other hand, contends*that Section 263 is applicable and
that deduction of these expenditures is prohibited.

The dispute arises as to which of these,-rules is

appraisal costs were ordinary, necessary expenses incurred for
the management, for maintenance of property held for the 'produc­
tion of income.

They would avoid Section 263 and a capital

was solely for the purpose of determining the real value of the .
stock..

Q

23
24

25

isn't it?

Well, that's about the fact of the matter?
It was to determine the. price of the stock, period.

There is no talk about their duty to purchase?

12

1

A

That.9s right,, Mr. Justice.

z

Q

And the only purpose of the proceeding was to

3

determine the price»

.

That was the purpose of the proceeding.

But, we

B

say, Mr. Justice, this is not the whole picture; we must look

6

beyond that.

7

a
s

IQ
1!
12
13
14

We say that you cannot look just at that segment of
the overall transaction; and we think that to ask the Court to
look at that fragment of the overall transaction is asking the
■
Court fco close its eyes to the entire picture.
This Court has provided precedents that help us in
approaching this problem to distinguish between deductible
expenses and nondeductible capital expenditures.

In the

Gilmore case, already mentioned this morning, the Court held
that the origin and the character of the obligation, from which

15
16

17
18
19
20

2?
22
23
24

an expenditure arises, determines the character of that organisa­
tion, of that expenditure».
In the Gilmore case Mr. Gilmore war owner of three
General Motors franchises.

He incurred substantial expenditures

in connection with a divorce action started by Mrs. Gilmore.
He attempted to deduct those expenditures on the theory that
an unsuccessful defense of a divorce action would have had
substantial adverse effects upon his status and his businesses, j
!
and therefore, these expenditures were incurred to protect,
manage and maintain property held for production of income.

25
13

!

I

He was ’victorious in the divorce action,, but this

2

Court held that the character of the proceeding from which the

3

payments came determined the origin and character, and that

4

therefore, firs» Gilmore"s divorce action arose out of the per­

3

sonal relationship, marital relationship and not out of any

6

income-producing action.

7
8

9

Accordingly, the expenditures were held to be nondeductible, personal expenditures.
Now, while the Gilmore case involves the question of

to

distinguishing between personal and business expenses, we think

n

that, nevertheless, that this broad decision by this Court,

12

indicates a principle that can be applied in determining whether

13

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

an expense incurred in an income-producing activity is a
business expense or a deductible expanse or a nondeductible
capital expenditure.
In its decision below, in this case, the 8th Circuit
looked at this overall transaction involving Mrs. Quigley's
stock and decided that this case was a transaction involving the
purchase of a capital stock.

Thus, this case is much like the

case decided by this Court some 30 years ago, in Helvering
versus Winmill.
In that case the taxpayer was engaged in the buying
and selling of securities.
age commissions he paid.

He attempted to deduct the broker­
And the Court held, however, that the

commissions constitute a part of the cost of acquisition of the
14

i

securities purchased» and that,, thereforef they were not de­

a

ductible .
We say that there is much comparison between the

3

4 I broker’s commission in that ease and the expenditure incurred
3 I in this ease»

Both were directly related to acquisition of:

$

capital assets, and we see no sound reason to distinguish be­

7

tween the two, merely because the amounts of each were cal"

When the majority stockholders voted to extend

Well, X understand that, but nevertheless, the

thing that triggered this whole problem was the desire to ex­
tend the corporation charter and maintain his stock ownership;
right?

A

Right.

Q

Well, why isn't that the origin of his claim?

A

1 think it is the origin, sir.

That decision to

extend is the origin, and I will come to that in just & moment.
But X think that, in addition to extending the life of the Cor­

poration for their own stock, which is the case as X understand
that you present, they here acquired soma additional stock
which is a little different.

You said that would be a harder question..
I did initially, but he convinced me during the

course of the argument that, if, Mr. Chief Justice, that if they

Mr. Jsutice White has presented it.

It has its roots in the same transac­

I think it does; sir.

Just because he

I think here we would

have an acquisition and we can't ignore that.

The origin,, by

tying in with the point Mr. Justice White was making a moment
ago, the origin, we say, of this appraisal proceeding was not
the sole question of determining the real value.

We think that

the origin lay in the decision to extend the corporate charter,
and the statute requires acquisition of these stocks.
So we say that the origin of this lay further back

16
17

I meanf

than just picking up after the corporate charter had been ex­
tended.

To view the appraisal proceeding as stemming from any

other origin, we think is to ignore the entire picture.
The character of the appraisal proceeding was set by
the character of this overall transaction, not just by the
little question of what is the value of the stock.
The appraisal proceeding, thus, was . part and parcel
of the whole transaction.

It was an integral part, but the

fact that the statute required the majority stockholders to

25
19

I

purchase the stock, and afforded the appraisal proceeding

2

machinery, does not change the character of the appraisal pro­

Now, the Woodwards capitalized the stock they paid to

3

Mrs, Quigley for her stock.

6

and the amount of money it cost them to determine what that

figure was.

for the stock.

9

We see no difference between that

It was a part of the total cost figure they paid

in that at all.

reference to the primary purpose test which has been mentioned

15

by many court decisions so argued to this Court.

i

That test comes into play when litigation involves a

16

17

defense or a protection of title, and the appraisal proceedings

18

in this case, however, there was no question about who owaad

20

the 8th Circuit pointed out in its decision,"The primary purpose

22

however, we could not agree with the Woodwards as to the pri-

The question of title was not involved.

Therefore, as

Even if it did,

mary purpose of these appraisal proceedings." In determining
that purpose, we would say, as we mentioned earlier, Mr. Justice!,
that we have to look at the entire transaction; the overall

21

i

transaction, not at just one little piece of it.
The tax law does not. allow us to fragment events that

2

are related.

4

to complete the acquisition of Mrs. Quigley's stock, which was

5

a part of the overall transaction.
The fact that the appraisal proceedings came after

it
12

Mrs. Quigley was deprived of certain of her stockholder rights,
was immaterial.

The tax law, as I indicated a moment ago, does

not allow us to separate events that are functionally related.
It not only does not allow it; it prohibits us from fragmenting
events that are related, when to do so would not achieve a
proper tax result.
Thus we say that the timing of these appraisal pro­

is not critical, but we say that the functional relationship of

15
these events, the appraisal proceeding, acquisition of the
IS
stock, that they are very definitely and directly related and
17
18

arifeieal.
The Woodwards have argued extensively that in this

19
case -the stock owned by Mrs. Quigley passed, essentially, to the

20
majority stockholders prior to the appraisal proceedings.
21
With this, we do not agree, for the reasons stated in

22
the decision of the 8th Circuit, that even if it were so, wa
23
would say that this does not make any critical difference in
24
this case.

The timing of the events which are directly related

25

22

1

should not be critical in determining what the tax consequences

2

of one of the little fragments is.

And so we say here that even though this appraisal

proceedings preceded or followed the transfer of title, it

makes no difference.

The Government persists on making an

analogy with the expenses of the appraisal liti gesti on in the

13

WinmiXl case.

Inthat case, the result of that case we have no

quarrel'with.

But, the brokerage fees were incurred to find a

seller for a buyer, or a buyer for a seller.

It was not a search for a buyer? there was one, that
was brought about by the extension statute itself.
The second point we would like to make is they in­
sist in dividing — insist in joining the two actions, that is,
23

the two elements of this:

CD the extension of the life of the

2

corporation by the special meeting of the shareholders * and the

valuation proceedings.
Obviously, the valuation proceedings wouldn't have

This case arose in 1911.

It would seem that it would

take care of this once and for all.
The Iowa Court cites this case in its dissenting
opinion in a ease entitled "Carroll versus Ringo*" which was Le­
the Supreme Court for an interpretation of various aspects of
this valuation and renewal statute.
In that they hold, without doubt, without controversy
that there is two transactions: that the title passes under
statutes like this when the vote is taken, simply because these
appraisal statutes are in abrogation of the common law and have
to fee strictly construed.

What does it do?

If you will get out cf the business then you can have]
in exchange for that, the State will grant you the right to—
the dissenting shareholder the right tohave her shares appraisee
In this particular instance, under the common law,
if there was a new statute the whole venture would have ter­
minated at the end of the 20 years in any event.

But,,this case, arising under a statute that creates
a Federal banking appropriation and was cited by the Iowa
Court as comparable to our particular statute, sets adrift the
Government’s argument relative to this business that it’s all
one transaction.
We recognise this business that one wouldn’t have
happened but for the other one.

The — we have no quarrel

with the Government in their citing andusing the Gilmore test
to determine whether or not this is a personal expense.or
an expenditure that is in a profit-seeking context — arose in
a profit-seeking context:,, but it can go no further than that.
This Court, in its Bingham Trust case., which is based
upon the Komhauser case, enumerated the approximate cost tests
which were approved in the Gilmore case, which very briefly,
takes care of the problem and would indicate that the deducti­
bility here would arise under Section 212 of the 1954 Code.
