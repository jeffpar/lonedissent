This case is before this Court, to review the

boy on the South Side• of, Chicago.
The confession that he gave primarily being respon­
sible for his subsequent conviction in the Criminal Court of
Cook .County, Illinois and his subsequent incarceration for
55 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary.
On April 20, 1961 at 4:00 in the afternoon the body
of a school teacher in the Lewis-Champlin Elementary School on
the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, was found.

She was dead.

She h 1 been stabbed numerous times and it appeared that he
had bee sexually molested.
Sixteen hours after her body was found Lea Arthur
Hester was removed from his schoolroom at the Lewis-Champ1in
School which would put it at approximately 8:00 o’clock a.ni.
From 8:00 o’clock a.m. on April 21st, a Friday, 1961, to the

carcerated.

The officers rummaged through the records of the

teacher came into- the room; they told her they wanted to see
Lee Arthuri

She told this to Lee Arthur.

She sent him out of

9

in the continuous unbroken custody of at least seven police

questioning him.

14

Hester over to another office by the name of Follis and the

15

principal's office, who kept him for approximately 15 minutes.

He then turned Hester over to twoother officers, Robert

17

Perkins and an officer by the name of Harold Thomas, who then

tools Hester to a police station in the neighborhood; they

Hester was searched at the Juvenile Detention Home?

all of his clothing was removed and from his pockets, all of

Every single witness who testified for the prosecu­
tion testified that Wws did not warn him that he need not makes
a statement; that we did not warn him that anything he said
could be used against him? we did not worn him that he was
i

entitled to counsel and we did not warn him that if he couldnH:
t

afford counsel we would give him counsel.*
I know that those are the four requirements in
Miranda versus Arizona.

Now, our basic point, today. Your

Honors is that in three ways this confession’ must, fall:
The first way, that basically, specifically and
uneguivocably, you cannot take a confession from a person al­
most illiterate.

How, then, he is 14 years old you must

couple that with "what we know, we cannot forget as lawyers what]
we know as man.'5

I think Justice Frankfurter once said that

And after five minutes, after they told him to get it off his

Now, it is the contention of the defendant that unde; ;

conventional principles of due process, forgetting the retro-

9

activity or lack thereof, of Miranda and Escobedo, that you

10

cannot take the confession of a 14-year-old of the type that

11

I have described, «after incommunicado holding of him, failing

12

to give him even the barest rudiments of representation or

13

having anybody stand-in loco parentis to him.

without providing him some

rudiments of due process.
First, that in order to assure him that the confes­
sion is voluntary, when you take it in a setting of an

-incom­

municado holding? when you take it in the presence of only
police officers, without any protection whatsoever, a bell
must ring,■a light must go on and the greatest conceivable
care must be given so that the confession is voluntary.
Third, and our brief asks the Court to abolish the
taking of juvenile confessions because there is no possible way
at least Lee Arthur Heater can be adequately advised of his
rights.

Advising Lee Arthur Hester of his rights is like

advising a deaf man of his rights.

X think it's

However, this case

can be decided under the «narrowest, the narrowest of principle:;;;
To be candid, yes X did ask to make that rule.
And that this case cam be examined, we must look at
what kind of individual is Lee Arthur Hester.
Q

Well, what about the 18-year-old who is a genius

and a senior in college?

We have a problem and I'd be frank to admit,

Q

rules like that; don't you?

h

Your Honor, we have a problem —

Q

Why don11 you stick to the case you are at?

Of the 14-year-old with nine years of mentality; why don't
you stick to that?
A

Yes, Your Honor»

Now, going back to- -the basic facts in this case, and
conventional due process rules, this case can be resolved byplacing this case within the purport and the ambit of all of
those,cases that this Court has decided, from Brown versus
Mississippi up to and including Miranda versus Arizona»
tod although Johnson versus New Jersey may not —»
does not require Miranda, to be applied to pre-Miranda cases,
nevertheless, the fact that a man was held incommunicado; that:
he was never advised of his rights; that he has a mentality of
an eight-year-old? that we have a 14-year-old person, chrono­
logically 14 with the mind of an eight-year-old.

this confession because the State failed to sustain its burden

of proof to show that the confession was voluntary.

10

Mr. Justice Schaofe.:

16

Mr, Justice

Under Illinois law and in the line of cases which

Mr, Justice Schaefer cites in his dissent, there was no doubt

Because, and Justice; Schaefer points this out in his

testimony of what occurred with these officers; what they said

to the mother and what the mother said to them, was never in

And 3: must be candid about that.

MR. KAPLAN:

Thank you.

I had intended to say

something else, but Mr. Justice Harlan raised a point and per­
haps Mr. Bolton didn’t say enough about the law.

There is no

There is no doubt — there is no doubt that whet, r
it’s 1961 pre-Miranda or 1969 post-Miranda, there is no doubt
that our premise that you cannot take a confession from a

boy like this.

This case must be, as this Court has always

said in a confession case, to look to the entire record.

27

The

1

fact that the record is so old in this case, the Court asks

2

that this case be considered on the entire record and after

Ov»

5

that these would be no appendix.

7

that with the fact that it took seven, eight, nine, ten

with the inability of. the defendant? when you add to that

imbecile.
If a police, department in .an urban canter like

18

Chicago, with a population of 3 and 1/2 million? a county of

19

6 million in Cook, doesn*t it know that you can't question a

20

14-year-old nincompoop without this Court telling them they

21

can't, they they don't deserve to be a police department.

22

Well, I concede that there are cases that this Court

23

has decided that may fairly have apprised prosecuting authori­

24

ties and police authorities of what the law was after the case

25

was decided, but conventional due process, — looking at

Culomfoe versus Connecticut, although there was physical

brutality there.

whether there is any legal:1 question other than the confiso ion

Well, 1 have other points in the brief»

search and seizure was improper.

The

There was no reason to take

all his clothes and leave him naked, except with a smock on
him, which is similar to Molinsky versus New York.

There was

no reason that they couldn’t have gone before a magistrate.
They could have even gotten a warrant.
they could have watched him.

They

The boy is in school;

took all of his clothes;

23

24

they hustled his clohtes to a crime lab which took three or
four weeks analyzing the clothes and.i» the courca or a

that it’s your blood? a hair of the lady is on your jacket;

If the arrest was — if the detention in the

have been made.

I realise that.

And lastly, Your Honor, that when you take this case

18

and the total absolute inability to cope with his captives,

19

plus the? fact that this is an innocent boy sitting in the

20

penitentiary; that an offer of proof as to a truth serum test

2!

was made and that he passed a truth serum test; that he denied

22

unequivocably that he had any knowledge of how the woman had

23

mat her demise.

i

24

I say that when a judge in chambers is presented with:

25

testimony like that, although 1 can’t find any basis in the law
30

1

to admit a truth serum test into evidence, that once he knows

2

that a boy has passed a truth 's6rnm .test some inquiry has to

be made as to whether or not the right guy is on trial.
