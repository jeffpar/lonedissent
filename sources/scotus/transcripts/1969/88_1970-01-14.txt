OPAL ARGUMENT BY SHIRO KASHINA„ ASSISTANT

8

ATTORNEY GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. KASHIWA:

May it please the Court:

This is a

8

review of a decision of the Sixth Circuit, relating to the

9

scope of the subject rule expressed by this Court in the

18

11

Miller case in 1943# 317 U.S. 369.
Briefly, the factual situation was, first of all, this:

12

had to do with the Nolin Reservoir Project in Kentucky.

13

Reynolds5 owned a total of 399 acres.

14

case of partial taking of 250 acres of the 390.

15

after the talcing inthis case there were 140 acres remaining.

The

The present case is the
In other words,

.

16

Out of the 250 acres, 172 acres were for inundation,

17

and 78 acres were for recreational purposes and it6s the 78

18

acres which causes the question in this case.

19

Now, what relation to the project?

The project was

20

Congressionaliy authorised way back in 1938# as a flood control

21

plan for the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.

22

Incidentally, after 1938, in 1944, Congress passed
I

23

a special statute authorizing acquisition of recreational areas

24

in conjunction with reservoir projects.

25

In 1956, planning funds were appropriated for the

Nolin Project and in July 1958 a general design memoranda was

approved»

This design memoranda contained, contemplated re™

In September, 1958 funds were provided by Congress

3

for the project and in January, 1959 the project was started.

6

In October 1959 this 78 acres for recreational pur­

7

poses was specifically set aside in a memo by the United States

&

Engineer.

On april 8, 1962 a suit, was filed and declaration

Incidentally, going back, the

But, just before the case went to the jury the court

changed its mind and said, "No," as to whether the 78 acres was

to consider it.

25

to the 78 acres, with and without enhancement.

And so the onus put on testimony with relation

trial court, held that, whether it wasin the scope of the pro­

The Court at first took the scope of the project
question and testimony was adduced only before the court.

But,

later when it changed its mind the witnesses testified? the
Government attorney did not cover the testimony as fully as he
did just before the court.

But he remembered —

but the court,

in considering the evidence, commenting on the evidence, went
back to the evidence he heard while h© was sitting out. of court.
And then in this mix-up the grounds for reversal came up.
I will go back tothis later.

So, the first issue in

this case is whether the scope of the project question is a
determination for the court or for the jury.
This Court in the Miller case, a case with substan­
tially similar factual background as in this case, held that it
was for the trial court to rule upon and not a jury question.
4

!

Infchafc oa.se the respondents' attorney tried to put on evidence

9

with relation to the valuation of the particular parcel and

o

the Government attorney objected, because whatever he offered

ing and specifically directed the witness not to include that

And this was a direct ruling by

And the court took part in the question­

reference to jury instructions given by the court and with

decision that has caused much difficulty in the courts below*

It’s this portionof this Court's

:

I maintain that the opinion means, arid at bast, that

it whs a question for the court.

The later comment in the

instruction •— it was really not an instruction given the jury

W

any leeway as for deciding one way or the other? it was the

n

comment by the court -that "you shall not, with relation to this

lot, considor enhancement.f5

But that was taken by the Sixth

.

19

Circuit, as well as the trial court to mean, well, there are

20

two portions of this decision and therefore we'll let the jury

21

have it.

22

We co tend that is a wrongful interpretation of what

23

this Court held, because the evidence of enhancement was not

24

allowed at all.

25

didn't have any evidence ©£ enhancement before it?

How could the jury consider enhancement when it

5

So, that was

1

a purely warning type of instruction.

2

And it is our position that as stated in the Wardy

3

case of the Fifth Circuit Court decision which follows the

4

Miller case, as we interpret it, the Circuit Court, Fifth

5

Circuit, well put it; "The judge decides a legal question which

6

limits the factors to the determination of just compensation,51
We further point to Rule 7lA(h) adopted in 1951

7

Thin

8

is the rule that has to do with eminent domain,.

In essence,

9

taking all the portion with relation to jury commissioners and

10

all of that out, as material in this case, it reads; "Anybody

1\

may have a trial by jury on the issue of compensation."

12

it further states; "Trial of all issues shall otherwise be toy

13

the court."

Then

As I said, this rule was adopted after the Miller

14
15

decision, tout we contend that the rule is perfectly consistent

18

with our position that legal questions which limit the factors

17

to the determination of just compensation are for the trial

18

court.
In fact, the way we read the rule it reads very much

19

20

in our favor.

21

We do admit that it does say "any party may have

22

What the, our opponents are saying, "Anything.that

23

has remotely to do with this compensation should be tried toy

the jury.

25

in most of these recreational area cases, quite a few of these,

We disagree, for various reasons.

We contend that

That is the rule.

which the judge should not have —

But, even though the judge told the jury that

We maintain that this should not have gone to

the jury at all.

said that thesre must be an indication at the outset of the

project that a particular tract or area will be acquired.

3

this, we contend is a very narrow rule; that Third Circuit

rule.

Mow,

In the Eighth Circuit it is sufficiently clear that

some land will be taken, even though the particular land is not

identified.

the rule in the Miller case.

That is the rule of the Eighth Circuit and that was
I

We contend, and I call this the Department of Justice

9
10

Rule, that the rule should be broader.

ii

is that the land was within the general area influenced by the .

12

project.

13

the basic reason in the — as stated in the Miller case -- was

14

that owners ought not to gain by speculating on probable in­

15

creased value due to governmental activities.

21
.22

23
24
25

The only requirement

And we maintain that that should be the rule because

In other words, the government should not pay for the
value it creates.
Another reason why the Third Circuit and Eighth
Circuit rules are unduly harsh on the government -- if those
rules are adopted it would be very difficult to change projects.
Not the whole project but the scope relying to the project.
As I stated in the Crance case, for example, the
public — instead of the recreational area being here they want
it over here and these changes are made by the engineer.

And

that should not affect the individual owner because it is withir
12

1

the recreational areas we*re contemplating.

2

we take it shouldn't change the rules.

And the fact that

If the Third and the Eighth Circuit rules are true

3
4

we contend that perhaps the government will mark out a very

5

large project as large as it should and then take within»

is what the government did in the Rock Creek case.

contend, as used in the Miller case, under the influenceof the

16

project.

18

This is what it really means.

And if we adopt this

view which is a view broader than the Third Circuit and the
Eighth Circuit, I think that justice will be done in all of

19

these cases and the government will not be paying for the value

it creates.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN S. SOLOMON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SOLOMON:

If the Court pleases:

First, 1 would

like to correct certain statements that I knew were inadvertently
13

1

in error.

2

because our position is this:

3

the factual situation in a minute -- but the Miller case, we

4

say, stands for the proposition that if, in the original

5

design of a project the land is delineated to be taken or as in

6

the Miller case, if it were marked out or designated that it

7

would probably be taken, then there is no enhanced value,,

The Miller case — I'll go into

If it's in the original scope and the original plans,

8
9

One is a crucial date — I'll review the dates again

no enhanced value, or as in the Miller case, where there was a

10

railroad right-of-way over an area tobe flooded and they had

11

marked out —• to use the terminology of the court in its

12

opinion: "marked out," or "designated" where this right-of-way

13

should be.

have taken,"

15

21

22
23
24
25

That's they they use the words "probably would
Or, whan th@ government was committed to .it.

In those two instances, we say that, there would be no
enhancement.

However, as in our case, where the government in

its original design and then in a later design, did not take in
the property, the 78 acres, but later did so in a third memo.
As we say, an afterthought, then we believe we are entitled to
the enhanced value of that land.
Q

How about the second stage?

A

The second stage was eliminated, Your Honor.

Erroneously —■ I want to give the date of that in this par­
ticular case.

For instance it was stated that construction

funds were appropriated in September and October of '58,
14

I

Construction was started in January of * 59.

And on June 17th

£

of ”59 there was a design memo, outlining the recreational areat:

3

which did not contain the — what we call the site of the 78

4

acres»

It did not contain it.
In othex" words, on July 14fch of ”58 when the govern-

B

6

mart approved the general design memo, which contained all

7

phases of .the construction and land acquisition, the 78 acres

8

was not in there and it was not in the memo for recreational

9

areas of June 17, 1959.

10

The Government permits this in its

brief, on page 3.
Q

II

Did I understand you,tMr. Solomon, to use the

12

terms "original design," and "scope of the project" as being

13

synonymous?

14

A

No, sir.

X9m saying that in the Miller case
And I think that's what — if the

15

they used it synonymously.

16

Court would realise the factual situation in the Miller case

17

and then I think the ambiguities of the terminology and the

18

vagueness of the verbiage and phrasing in the Miller case would

19

be dissipated.
Knowing the factual situation where in the Miller

20
21

case, in the original design they had marked out or designated

22

where they were going to take a right-of-way.

23
24
25

They didn't take

if originally, but they had marked it up and designated it to be
taken.

And then they do take it and the court said, "This

probably would have been in the scope originally, which it was,

15

1

because ifc was marked up on. that map»
Q

2
3

Mr. Solomon, where are all of these maps filed?

Where do you find them?
A

There were no maps filed in this case. Your

6

Q

I mean, where is the original design?

7

A

The design, memo was not filed in this case.

4
5

Honor.

8

The government did not file it but the testimony of Max Bore,

9

who is a government witness —

10

Q

But I gather you have to get the internal

11

records from some government department, condemning the land?

12

is that it?

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

That's how you discover what, originally was

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

contemplated and that was mapped out and drawn out.

Is that

the way it worked?
A

Yes, sr.

As stated by the Government, the

Justice Department, the judge in the -- the trial judge had put

on a hearing out of the presence of thejury to begin with, to
see whether, as a matter of law he could determine whether this
land was entitled to enhanced value or not, being whether it was
in the scope of the project or not.
And the government called its witness —
Qa

And they introduced the desigrs and the

chronology of things? is that it?

A

?

Yes, sir.

Then, the other inadvertent error

2

of the Justice Department was that while the opening statement

3

was being made, not when the jury was being charged, but when

4

fchfe opening statement was being made»

5

to the bench and said that ha was in error in his first finding
