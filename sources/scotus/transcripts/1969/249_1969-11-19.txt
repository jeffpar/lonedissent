Mil. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Case Wo. 249, Barlox-/ against

Collins.

Mr. Edgar, you may proceed.

ARGUMENT OF HAROLD EDGAR, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. EDGAR:

7

8

Mr. Chief, Justice, may it please the

Court;
This case concerns the very limited purposes for which

9
10

assignments may be made of benefits payable under the Upland

11

Cotton Program.

12

Secretary of Agriculture may disregard the considerable legisla­

13

tive and administrative construction of the statutory phrase

14

"making a crop" and redefine it to authorize assignments for

15

the purpose of paying rent for land.
Prior to his change in regulations such assignments

16
17

More particularly, it concerns whether the

were prohibited.
Petitioners, tenant farmers, who were hurt by this

18
19

change in regulation brought suit in the Middle District of Ala­

20

bama, seeking a declaration that the changed regulation was

21

invalid.

22

The District Judge held that they had no standing to

23

raise the claim, and that in any event it was not meritorious,

24

rhe Fifth Circuit affirmed on grounds of standing alone.

25

lourt granted certiorari last June.
2

This

1

I would like to begin by showing how the changed regu­

2

lation harms petitioners, tenant farmers.

3

in the traditional pattern of Southern cotton farming.

4

stay on the same land year in and year out, and some have been

5

on the farm all their lives, some 61 years, and the shortest-

6

named petitioner has been there for over ten years.

7

They farm the land
They

What they do is at the beginning of the year they make

8

a rent note with the landowner.

3

right to use the land.

That rent note gives them the

It also normally provides for the land-

!0

owner paying them small advances to pay for food and clothing

11

while the crop is being grown.

12

The landlord for this gets both the right to rent at

13

settlement date, which is after the crop is in, and at that time

14

the advances are repayable with interest.

15

tenant farmers do not have any credit standing with the community

16

typically they are forced to buy all the seed and tools that

17

they need to make this crop from the landowner, who extends them

18

credit and charges prices far higher than the prices charged in

19

the community-at-large.

20

However, since the

'Moreover, interest is payable on that amount.

So it

21

turns out that at the end of the year they have to pay their

22

rent for all their purchases in the interim and typically they

23

have nothing much, and this goes on year in and year out.

24

23

Now, the Upland Cotton Program promised a somewhat
better deal for petitioners in this position.
3

What it was was,

1

it authorised in Section (d){13} that payments made under the

2

program could be assigned.

5

funds coining in.

Now, the assignment is the right to

If you can assignment, you can get credit.

People

You can avoid the necessity of buying all your goods at

7

the stores maintained by landowners and you can thereby perhaps

3

save some of the money, so at the end of the crop season you wili

9

have some money left.

10

Q

i

You say, Mr. Edgar, the people know in the communit y

H

you have a definite amount of funds coming in?

12

advance just what the figure will be?
A

13

Is it known in

It is not known exactly in advance what the figure

14

will be.

It depends on the amount of the cotton that is grown

15

and the amount of land that is diverted.

16

a fixed payment and you are not growing any crop on the land

17

vierted, therefore, for that amount to be fixed.

18

price support is predictable by knowing the typical yield rate

19

in the area, but it is not by any manner or means --

The land diverted is

The actual

20

Q

Exactly predictable?

21

A

Wo.

22

Now, if they also, Your Honors, what they can do is

23

that they can start cooperatives, as they have done in this case

24

Tenant farmers can get together and by pooling their credit

25

resources they can purchase at far less than

the costs they are

4
I

1

now paying.

2

If the landlord, if they can assign these payments to

3

the landowner from whom they rent, they in effect lose the right,

4

the credit that Congress intended for them.

5

insists that the assignment be made as an additional security

S

for renting the land.

The landowner simply

In that case he cannot use any of the credit that Con­

7

8

gress had provided for his benefit, and so far as he is concernet ,

9

Congress might as well not have passed Section (d)(13) , which die

10

grant farmers this right of assignment for the purpose of creat­

11

ing credit for small farmers.

12

The Government doesn"t deny that this is going on.

13

What happened in this case is that the landowner told the peti­

14

tioners that either they make the assignment or get off the

15

land.

16

were thrown off the land, they were deprived of their allotments

17

and left without any source of income.

18
19
20

Two or three of them refused to make the assignment.

The\

The others made the assignment and then were deprived
of the credit which Congress provided.
The respondentschallenge that this is what happened.

21

They say the fact that this happened does not suffice to warrant

22

granting relief.

23

The question is whether Congress permitted this result.

24

The relevant statutory language is found in Section 3(g) of the

23

Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, which provides for

5

1

assignments for the purpose of making a crop.

2

considerations, we think, that preclude interpretation of this

3

language to encompass assignments for the purpose of paying

4

rent for land.

5

There are three

First, the structure of the statute itself; second,

6

its legislative history, demonstrating a congressional intent to

7

use the phrase as a limitation on assignment rights; and finally]

8

administrative construction given the terny which from the moment

9

of enactment in 1937 has been included until the changed regula­

10

tion challenged, any assignments for the purpose, of paying rent.

11

First, the construction of the statute.

It provides

12

for assignments to secure cash and advances for the purpose of

13

making a crop.

14

securing use of land an advance.

15

that are supplied to you on credit, so the language of the status e

16

does not seem to be looking to assignments for the purpose of

17

paying rent.

18

Only in the theoretical economists' view is
Normally advances mean goods

Secondly, the legislative history recently suggests

19

that the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act confirms

20

that approach.

21

22
23
24
25

The Act was passed as a compromise provision as an
amendment put to work by a conference committee.

The House bill

permitted assignments for all purposes, but only to landowners.
-The bill was twice introduced in the Senate, a broader
assignment bill permitting assignments to anyone, and the Senate
6

1

refused to pass it because it provided insufficient protection

2

for tenant farmers from being forced or from being either by

3

their economic circumstances or their own lack of prudence from

4

making inadvisable assignments.

5

So the Senate rejected the bill twice.

In' conference

6

the bill came forth, but it came forth limited by these provi-

7

sions that are designed to protect.

8

the limitation of the purpose of assignments to making a crop.

One of those protections is

j
!

9
10

Now, making a crop is not a term of common usage.

It

is also a technical agricultural term, and we believe --

12

Isn't the only ques- }
|
tion here now at this stage the question of standing to raise

13

these questions?

II

Q

A

Could X ask you a question?

j

Well, Your Honor, I had planned to deal with the

standing question at the end of my argument.
Q

Isn't that what was decided by the lower court,

that there was no standing?
A

Well, the lower court also intimated its views on

the merits, yes, but its specific view was --

20

Q

It was not as to the merits?

21

A

No, Your Honor, not expressly.

22

I would turn, then, to the standing question.

23

Q

The point is, is that all that is required?

24

A

Well, Your Honor, we believe a decision on the

25

entire case is appropriate in this Court.
7

The standing question

1

and the question on the merits is closely linked.

2
3

Q

You would like to have it, but I still ask you

if the only question we are to decide is what was standing?

4

A

Yes, Your Honor.

5

Q

Therefore, I would assume that you disagree with

6

the lower court that there was no standing?

7

A

Mr. Justice Harlan, —--

8

Q

If the Court decided -- -

9

A

I think it is fair to say that the Court of Appeals

10

strongly indicated its view on the merits, as respondent noted,

11

and in our view that the questions are so close that it doesn't

12

warrant remanding for the purpose of the Court of Appeals deci­

13

sion.

14

Q

We don't review intimations.

We only review hold­

15

ings, counsel, so you had better address yourself to the stand­

16

ing question.

17

A

Yes, Your Honor.

18

We believe that the Fifth Circuit decision Xvnas errone­

19

ous in denying standing in this case.

The source of confusion

20

there was that they analogized this case to the case of the

21

competitive interloper.

22

severe standing problems in this Court are those in which a per­

23

son whose conduct is in no way described by the statute challenge

24

the action of someone else who is under some form of statutory

25

limitation and urges that the statutory limitations that govern

Most of the cases which have raised

8

3

1
2

•he other person's conduct are not being carried out.
This is not such a case at all.

For example, ir the

V?

Jecretary of agriculture had, instead of expanding the purpose

4

for which assignments might be made — if he had simply sard,

5

"No assignments shall be made at all," it seems the petitioners

6

are surely entitled to come to Court and challenge his construc­

7

8

9
10
11

12
13
14

15
16

tion of his duties under the statute in simply saying that the
statute will not be given effect.
There is no, from the point of view of standing

ioesn't seem to us that there is any difference if he is cutting
back power to assign or expanding it, where it is clear that tne
purposes that the congressional reasons which underlay the impose
tion of the restrictions on standing were precisely to benefit
tenant farmers in the same way that a settler of the spenddniit
trust imposes limits on the spendthrift trust to protect the
beneficiary against his unwise judgment.
Just as a matter of common law, the analogue to the

17
18
19

20

ic

common law and interest protected at common law, the strictest
standard this Court has ever used in the standing cases, any
trustee who informed a beneficiary of a spendthrift clause fcha«.
he was going to disregard the terms of the trust, the beneficiary

21

would have standing to seek removal of the trust, and we suggest
that even under the common law analogue there is standing in
23
24
25

this case.
There is also clearly standing in this Court's decision
9

1

in Hardin two terms ago»

There, the Court said that there was

a

standing, standing did exist when a person was a member of a

3

class whose interests Congress had sought to protect..

4

Mow, as we say, the legislative history of Section 18

5

is clear.

It emerges as a broad assignment provision.

The

6

Senate rejects it precisely because it is too broad, and it

7

manages to get approved with narrow limitations on the purposes S

8

for which assignments may be made.

9

which the approval, the congressional approval, was granted, so

<

That is the only ground upon

10

we think in light of that, it is clear that these tenant farmers

11

are within the class that Congress hadintended to protect.

12

Furthermore, that conclusion is particularly strong,

13

seems particularly mandated, insofar as this Court has often sale,

14

that there ought to be a presumption that administrative action

15

is judicially reviewable.

16

Now, no one else can have standing in this case but

n

petitioners.

18

thought himself harmed, would have no standing to raise the claim

19

pressed herein.,

20

it is proper in the light of assumption of judicial review that

21

standing be conferred on these who are adversely affected in

22

fact, and that is, of course,the constitutional minimum.

23

there is no question here that these parties, or these petitioner s

24

are adversely affected in fact.

25

In other words, a landowner who is harmed, who

These plaintiffs are the only ones who do, and

But

Some of them have been thrown off the land that they
10

1

have been working all their livesf and that, we think, holds the

2

conclusion that standing is present.

3

Q

Were you in the Court yesterday?

4

A

No , Your Honor.

I have read the Government's brieij,

5

but I was not here yesterday.

6
7

Your Honors, I would like to return to the question of;
♦
making a profit, what it may permissibly mean. The term is not

3

one of broad, general usage.

3

a synonym for current farming costs.

It is not, as respondent suggests,
It has a long meaning,

10

confirmed by agricultural dictionaries, that it refers to pro­

11

ducing crops.

12

doss not refer to the rental of land.

13

It refers to harvesting, to sowing the need.

It

This interpretation, we think, is confirmed by the

14

fact that within nine days

15

tary of Agriculture issued regulations expressly for bidding by

16

assignments for the purpose of paying rent for land.

17

immediately after the enactment of the statute.

18

after the Act was passed the Secre­

13

purpose had been.

20

owners to simply usurp the credit that had been provided for t

21

tenant farmers by forcing them to assign, and he said it could

22

not be done.

23

He saw the potential risk in permitting land­

Now, the same risk is present today, and as we say,

24

respondent does not challenge the fact that the effect of permit­

25

ting assignments to pay rent is to take the credit that Congress
11

?

2

provided a way for the tenant fanner.
Nov;, the question becomes what effect this has under

3

the new Act, Section (d)(13) which, as we say, is the provision

4

enacted in 1965, which incorporates by reference the prior law.

5

Now, that new Act is also pervaded -- it has several

S

protections for small farmers in it.

7

Act expressly authorizes and commands the Secretary to issue

8

regulations to protect the interests of small tenant farmers and

3

sharecroppers.

Section (d)(10) of the

10

So it can’t be said that this purpose which underlay

11

the 1937 Act has somehow, that Congress is of the view that it

12

is no longer important.

13
14

Q

It is important,

You say the Act instructs the Secretary to issue

regulations to protect the farmer?

15

A

Yes, Your Honor.

16

Q

Where is that?

17

A

It is Section 7 USC 144(d) (10) , Your Honor, which

18
19

Is that 10, Section 1?

is Section 103(d)(10) of the 1949 Agricultural Act.
Q

I take it, then, v?e have the Secretary responding

20

by issuign what he thought was a regulation to protect the inter­

21

ests of the tenant farmer, and that in his judgment it was neces

22

sary to, in order to help the farmer make a crop, to permit assic n-

23

ments for cash rent as wall as other costs?

24
25

A

Justice White, we don't think that that construc­

tion of what has happened is a likely one.

12

The reason is that —

You think he would disobey his duty?

j

at least, it was to help the tenant farmer, I take it.

Is. that j
[

3

right, or not?

4
5

A
reason.

C
7

First of all, for roost farmers it does not --—
Q

So he disobeyed his duty and he issued a regula-

tion that hurt them?

3
0

We would not accept that, Your Honor, for this

A

No.

This regulation, Your Honor, is not issued --

the regulations we are challenging are not issued pursuant to

10

Section (d) (10).

These are not part of those regulations,,

They,

11

rather, are regulations that are issued under Section (d)(13) .
What the Secretary has done in our view, he has issued

12

13

regulations in part protective of tenant farmers under (d}(10).

14

He has redefined the term "making a crop" in a way v?hich preju­

15

dices severely tenant farmers for the benefit of landowners and

16

does very little good for the rest of the farming population.
Now, the people who simply own land obviously do not have

17
18

to assign for the purpose of paying rent.

13

value of the cotton land is between one-third —- at least in

20

Alabama

21

The average rental

between one-third and one-ha if the value of the crop.
So, even those farmers who do rent land are in no need

22

of the right, to assign for the purpose of paying rent.

23

they can do is, they can use the assignment to purchase the seed,

24

the tools, the other things that they need, which are as large ~

25

in fact, a larger portion of the ultimate crop value, and use
13

What

1

whatever resources they are now expending to get those goods

2

for the purpose of paying their rent if they are dealing with a

3

landowner who will simply refuse to accept — refuse to rent

4

except on a "pay now" basis.

5

Now, if the Secretary's purpose were merely to help

6

other farmers, he could have prevented the harm that is done

7

here simply by issuing the regulation under Section (d)(10),

8

which would say that even though assignments can be made for the

9

purpose of paying cash rent, no landowner can remove a tenant

10

from the farmer who refuses to make the assignment.

1

If the only purpose which underlay the changed defi­

12

nition of making a crop was to facilitate financing for farmers

13

as a whole, this particular lawsuit could have been avoided by

14

a protective regulation issued pursuant to Section id} (10)-.

15

Q

I take it the Secretary probably thought he was

16

aiding tenant farmers

17

A

Your Honor, we do not know what the reasons under­

18

lying the Secretary1s change of regulations were.

They are not

19

issues after any formal proceeding, or issued with any explana­

20

tion.

21

what by the new Act to the extent that the tenant farmers can

22

avoid the whole structure of rent notes, advances, credit from

23

the landowner.

24

simply do not know whether that was the motivating factor behind

25

the Secretary's action, whether it was his view, a view which we

farm content.
The reason we don’t think that was his motivation is,

12

if that is all he wanted to do, he could have protec ted against

13

this particular abuse, from which he was aware ~~ I mean from

14

Alabama — tenant farmers, organized, presented their claim,

15

and he could have protected against this abuse by .issuing a

16

regulation precluding the landowner from removing the tenant froj

17

his farm if the tenant refused to make the assignment.

18

If the only purpose behind the Secretary's action was

19

a facilitafcive one, then the harm here alleged, which is a real

20

harm, could have been taken away, could have been removed very

21

simply, so it is for that reason we do not think this was what

22

underlay the Secretary's action, particularly insofar as even

23

those farmers who rent land who both own land and rent land can

24

normally juggle their use of assignment to pay for their crops

23

with their cash and pay for their land with their cash and their

MR. STRAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

11

I would like to start, if I may, with something in the

nature of a statement of certain factual propositions which bear

13

on this case and which I think put it in something of a per­

14

spective .
First, although I think it was clearer from petitioner;

should be clear that what we are talking about is a new program,

13

a 1965 program, and not a program which has been running since

19

1938 .

20

Petitioners have no right to make assignments of their

'21

cotton payments except under the 1965 Act.

The right of assign­

22

ment was new.

23

in which they were permitted to make assignments to pay for

24

cash rent, to the regulation that permitted them to make those

25

assignments for thatpurpose was adopted prior to the first crop

They have never used it except under circumstance

year of 1966, to which the Upland Cotton Program of 1965 applies
They had not been able to make assignments at least

3

since commodity payments ceased under the 1938 Act in the very

4

early 1940's, and now they can do so.

5

Now, they can do so, and the terms under which they car

6

do so have not been materially changed since that program began.

7

The second, and really part of that first observation,

6

is that there has been no continuity in the administration of

9

assignments generally.

Section 8(g) was passed in 1938.

Through

10

1941 literally hundreds of thousands of assignments were made

11

every year.

12

I
necessary to make commodity payments in order to secure agricul-j

13

fcural prosperity, and Congress ceased to do so.

14

In that year, the war began.

It was no longer

Assignments feel dramatically, and by 1952, when sta­

13

tistics ceased to be kept, and when the Secretary of Agriculture

IS

went to the Congress and said, “1 don't need the statute any

17

more, wipe it off the books" -— by 1952 only 2100 assignments

13

were made under that Act in that year.

19

So that there was, in effect, a 20-year hiatus

20

between the arid of practical importance for Section 8 (g) and the

21

enactment of the 1965 Act, which the Government's position is is

22

the only Act at issue in this case, and we think that has some

23

substantial bearing on the issues before the Court.

24
25

The third thing, and I think this gats to some extent,
Mr. Justice White, to the questions you were asking, is that
18

1

there had been a radical shift in tenure pattern even among those

2

who rent the land they farm since 1938.

3

We pointed out in a footnote to our brief, on. page

4

32, footnote 22, that in 1935 42 percent of all farmers were

5

tenants and they farmed 32 percent of this nation's land.
By 1964 their place had been taken by part-owners.

6
7

Part-owners are farmers who own some land and rent other land , .

8

typically for cash.
In 1964 part-owners outnumbered tenants, and they

9
10

1

farmed, almost four times as much land.
Now, at the time we wrote the brief, 1 had not been

11
12

able to find statistics relating to cotton farming, and the foot­

13

note notes that fact.

14

such statistics on a statewide basis, and if the Court please, I

15

should like briefly just to mention theones which strike me as

16

being significant.

17

compiled on a statewide basis by the Department of Commerce in

18

something called the "United States Census of Agriculture."

Since that time, I have been able to find

They are from, the Census figures which are

19

In 1964 the Census of Agriculture for Alabama shows

20

that 33 percent of the commercial farms in that state raising

21

cotton were operated by part-owners.

22

33 percent of Alabama, as cotton farmers who have rent obliga­

23

tions, these cotton farmers held 53 percent of the state's cottar

24

land.

25

These cotton farms, this

That is over half.
On the other hand, cash tenants, the only other major
19

1

group with a aash rent obligation, were only 11 percent of the

2

state's commercial cotton farmers, and they farmed only 7 per­

3

cent of its land.

4

from numerical figures that appear on pages 64 and 65 of this

5

volume, and if the Court pleases, I have xeroxed copies of these

6

pages, which I have already given to counsel, and which 1 will

7

leave with the Clerk.

8
9
10
11

The figures I am referring to are derived

The point is that there were over twice as many partowners as cash tenants in 1965, and they farmed over seven times
as much cotton land.
One can go on at considerable length, but the point

12

is a simple one, that petitioners are not facing a changed inter-

13

pretation of an established program under an old statute in

14

which they have long participated.

j

15

They are complaining of the initial interpretation of

16

a new program which was passed and which applies in conditions

17

very different from those which existed when the now moribund

18

statute on which it happens to draw wa.s passed.

19

statute of 1965 was not a tenant statute, and its interpretation

20

as respects assignments to finance the farming costs of cash ren

21

primarily affects part-owners and not cash tenants.

22

The assignment

To get back to the other point of the questions you

23

were asking, Justice White, regarding, well, why has the Secre­

24

tary done this, what about the protection of tenants?

23

ars were complaining in the course of their colloquy with you.

that he had adopted no regulation to provide for the protection

2

of tenants, that this was meant to apply to all farmers with cash

Of course, there were regulations which were adopted

for the Upland Cotton Program at precisely the same day and the

7

not be approved for payment by county committees, if the county

11

committee determines among other things that there exists between

12

the landlord and any tenant or sharecropper any lease, contract,

13

agreement or understanding unfairly exacted or required by the

14

landlord, which was entered into in anticipation of participating

15

in the program, the effect of which is to force the tenant 03:

16

sharecropper to pay over to the landlord any payment earned by

17

him under the program, to change the status of any tenant or

18

sharecropper so as to deprive him of any payment or right he would

19

otherwise have had under the program, to decrease the rants to be

20

made by the tenant — to increase, rather — the rent to be paid

21

by the tenant or decrease the share of the crop or its proceeds

22

to be received by the sharecropper.

23

Now, of course, disagreements could exist that are

24

not present in the allegations and legal contentions in this

25

case.

Disagreements could exist as to whether those regulations
21

1

are sufficient, whether they are properly enforced.

2

I don't believe that that is the case.

3

sure that there could be reasonable arguments about the questioni

4

Obviously,

Petitioners do, and I am

But what strikes me as being significant to this case

5

is that petitioners will have no part of authority’s regulations

a

and petitioners will have no part of the section under which the],

7

were adopted, 7 USC 1444(d)(10), which does specifically provide

8

that the Secretary of Agriculture must provide adequate safe­

9

guards to protect th©interests of tenants and sharecroppers,
They don’t argue for standing under that provision,

10
11

for example.

Their argument — here is a provision that says the

12

Secretary must protect the tenants.

13

That is not their argument, nor do they argue that way on the

14

merits.

Therefore, we have standard:

The Secretary has failed to protect them.

15

Of course,

16

it may be significant that that provision only requires adequate

17

safeguards.

18

petitioners cite in part, or quote in part in their brief,,

19

I believe it is at pages 20 and 21 of their brief.

There is a little bit of legislative history which

Petitioners quote ia part a House report from the Soil

20
21

Bank Program at page 39 of that report.

22

that says, "No single problem connected with the proposed Soil

23

Bank has caused the committee more concern than that of provid­

24

ing adequate protection of tenants and sharecroppers under the

25

program."
22

They quote the sentence

Q

What section do you think the assignment regulation

'was issued under?
A

The assignment regulation was issued under Section

d(13), of course.
Q

And d (13) says what, it says that the provisions

of a certain section shall apply?
A

That’s right, which are Sections 390, which is

Section 590(g) or 8(g) of the 1938 Act.
Q

And the Secretary, however, has issued a reglation

15

which interprets that section or which applies it in a way that

16

it hasn’t been applied before?

17

A

Well, I would have to disagree.

1 think in a

18

formal sense, what you say is true, but since that statute went

19

out of — lost practical meaning in 1932 and was, in effect, afeai

20

doned by the Secretary in 1952, since these regulations were adopte-

21

in 1965 immediately following the enactment of the Upland Cotton

22

Program in that year

23

diately following the adoption of the Upland Cotton Program —

24

we view this as interpretations of the Upland Cotton Act.

6

In 1965, particularly, I think Congress was well

1

aware that it was cutting by almost 30 percent the level of

3

support that farmers were receiving under the Act and they were

9

going to need new financing.
Q

10

Why would you suggest, then, that these farmers

11

involved in this case aren't within the group which this section

12

was intended to benefit?
A

13

In 1965?

Oh, I fully admit that they are within

14

the group that this section was intended to benefit, but 1 have

16

Being in that group, they come in and say that

this section was intended to benefit the farmers, this section

Fail to benefit them.

or frustrate the purposes of the Act.
Mow, why doesn't that satisfy Hardin?
25

1

2
3

A

My understanding of Hardin was that it referred

rather specifically — and for that matter, the Court’s prior case
it referred rather specifically not to a simple matter of

4

benefits, but rather an issue of protecting.

5

this case used in Hardin, and I am quoting from page 6 of the

S

opinion as it appears in Volume 390, is that when the particular

1

statutory -- and the particular statutory provision invoiced does

8

reflect the legislative purpose to protect a competitive inter­

9

est, the injured competitor has standing.

The language which

10

Q

This isn’t a competition case.

11

A

Mo, this is not a competition, case, nor do we con­

12

tend that Hardin is restricted to competition cases.

We do

13

think, however, that there is some function to be served, and we

14

think we observe that function being served by a limitation in

15

those terms, in protection terms, in keeping people from injury

IS

rather than perhaps in failing to do for them everything that

17

they think ought to be done for them under a beneficial Federal

13

program.

19

Q

Do you think there is a case of controversy here?

20

A

Yes, X do.

21

Q

How about the question of standing that we are

22

talking about, a Hardin-type of question?
A

23

X think we are talking about a Hardin-type cf

24

question.

I think what this Court, having heard the argument

2S

/esterday, and having heard the argument yesterday in the ADAPSO

1

case, I went back and did a little homework that perhaps I shoulc

2

have done before.

2

What the Court said in. Stark and Wickard is rather to

4

the point in this regard.

5

with what seems to me just, this problem.

6

same problem that came up in Abbott» what is the relationship

7

between what this Court has frequently said was an assumption of ■

8

judicial review, on one hand, and standing, on the other hand,

9

and the Court was quite careful in this case, as it was, I think,

There,, it had to deal rather expressly
j
It is part of the

10

in Abbott itself to distinguish between the two situations, to

11

say before we get to the question of review or reviewability,

12

we have fco resolve standing.

i

And then it went on to say that the Court was very far

13
14

from assuming that the Courts are charged more than administra­

IS

tors or legislatures with the protection of the rights of the

16

people.

17

Under Article III, Congress established Courts to

18

adjudicate cases and controversies on claims as to infringement

19

of individual rights.

20

some nexus, as the Court has put it, in Jenkins vs. McKevin,

21

just last term.

22

That is, there must ba some special claim,

I. have that here someplace.

The Cous’t said that soraetl ing

23

more than an adversary interest is necessary to confer standing.

24

Thera must be soma connection between the official action chal­

25

lenged and some legally protected interest of the party
27

1

challenging that action»

2

Again, protection»

I can't imagine that those words were casually used»

3

In every one of this Court's opinions, there has also been an

4

interest in specificity, and X can't imagine that that, either,

3

was inadvertent»

6

7

the conduct of Government and business, really»

(inaudible)

3

No, that is certainly true.

10

Q

(inaudible)

11

A

Well, maybe I should start with another — if I

12

may, this is in response to your question, I think»

13

clear, isn’t it, that if petitioners, or rather if you are

14

right, in the direction your questions are leading, it won’t be

13

only petitioners that have standing.

It is quite

It will be every farmer in

the country, or every cotton farmer ir?, the country who is dis­
pleased by something the Secretary of Agriculture has done, who
18

thinks that he ought to have got more, that the level of benefits

19

ought to have bean a little higher, who will have standing to

20

come in, because it is quite clear that in a benefit content

21

this statute is meant to benefit not just tenants, but people

22

principally other than tenants, even those among those who pay az sh

23

rents.

24

So we are not talking about just tenants versus nobody,

25

Q

Assume the Secretary had left the regulations just
28

r

'i

like they were before»

z

A

Right.

3

Q

And a tenant came in and said, "Gee, Mr. Secretary,

4

j;
I just can't stay on my land, because the landlord wants security,,

5

and I want to give it to him, but you say I can't have it.

can't assign it."

7

A

Yes.

"Now, I would like to challenge your interpretation

9

11

of this section."
A

Well, if that had happened, I assume that the much

more numerous part-owners would have been arguing that way.

12

Q

But how about standing?

13

A

I think they Would have no standing.

14

Q

You would go both ways on this?

15

A

Certainly.

16

Q

You would have to.

17

A

We certainly do.

It is either all farmers or

18

none, and we think in that situation the choice is known.

19

Court's cases have traditionally and consistently limited

20

standing to the area of protection, not simple benefits, and

21

indeed we don't understand petitioners, who argue differently,

22

because they seem to be arguing that either tenants will be able

23

to get review or not.

But as in Hardin, for example, the

the merits at length,

1 think our arguments are fairly ade­

quately set forth in the brief and implicit in what I said
before,

I just want to make a couple of very quick points.

j

First, that we are dealing here with — the Government
insists we are dealing here with the 1965 statutes, not with

23

the 1938 statutes.

And in connection with that, this Court

24

may decide that making a crop means this or that.

23

for the reasons we set out in the brief that it vary comfortably

You said the merits were here?

I think the Court could reach the merits if it

I don't see any reason in this case to do so.

Well, I would prefer if you would say something

about the merits myself.

I won't argue.

The point I wanted to make was only this s

We

meaning of financing the expenses of making a crop.

crop.,

about the meaning of this statute,, how it was applied, about

Court were to say, "Nonetheless its reenactment of the statute

And this Court responded that the scanty legislative

knew of these particular regulations, much less the indirect

impact now ascribed to them.

scanty legislative history that exists, prior interpretation was

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD EDGAR

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6

MR. EDGAR:

2 think I can do it in that.

7

Your Honor» I would first like to speak a bit about

&

the question of whether a remand would be appropriate in this

9

case.

Under both the Government's discussion of standing and

70

in our discussion of standing the purpose of the assignor pro®*

11

vision is put very much in question in order to decide whether

12

the standing exists.

13

In view of the necessity of elucidating the purposes

14

underlying the law that bears very closely on the scope of the

IS­

IS
17

18

discretion which the Secretary has in changing interpretations
of the meaning of the statutory language that have been well
settled — it has been well settled.
In view of that fact, it would seem that to remand

19

the question -- once that task had been done in this Court, to

20

mand that question to the courts below would ba inappropriate.

well reach the merits in all these cases.
