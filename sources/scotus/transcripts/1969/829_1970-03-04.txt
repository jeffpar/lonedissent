I would like to reply to the jurisdictional point

It's reprinted in the appendix of the Government's
It provides that a state plan for

consideration any other income and resources of any child or
relative claiming Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
The HEW regulation construes that critical language,
"any other income and resources," as meaning actual income,
actual contributions made by a stepfather or a MARS.
nia’s approach is to the contrary.

Califor­

They assume that where

there is a stepfather or a MARS, that his income is attributable,
and is a resource of the child without any actual proof.
That’s the essence of the controversy here.
California agrees and the Court below agrees that

if HEW'S regulation is valid as a proper implementation of the

Act, that California's conflicting statute must necessarily

fall in the sense that California can no longer continue to

to cut them off.

I’m not sure that I understand Your HOnor —

How about the new California statute?

Well, the new California statute is, as Mr.

Amsterdam discussed yesterday, does raise, with respectsto
parts of the controversy before the Court, some questions that

MR. BEYTAGH:

Thank you.

40

1

We think that the regulation is valid for a number of

z

reasons»

3

attaches» as this Court has said a number of times, to the

4

administrative interpretation by a government official charged

S

with the responsibility for administering a particular act.

First, we think that a presumption of validity always

As Mr, Amsterdam indicated yesterday, the same

6

7

approach, the approach of requiring proof of actual income

&

before reduction of benefits has been applied across the board

9

in other categorical public assistance programs by HEW.

10

Moreover, we think that in 1967 Congress, at 1 ast .

II

implicitly, approved the HRB regulation when it reenacted the

12

act and enacted certain amendments to these provisions, knowing

13

what HEWBs construction had been, and not seeking to change it.
Moreover, we think that it's quite clear in King

14

13

versus Smith the Court specifically referred to a predecessor

16

regulation and said that “Regulations of HEW" ~ this is in

17

'

footnote IS of King versus Smith, "Regulations of HEW which

18

clearly comport with the statute restrict the resources which

IS

are to be taken into account under Section 602 to those that

20

are, in fact, available to an applicant or recipient for cur­

21

rent use on a regular basis.

22

from consideration resources which are merely assumed to be

23

available to the needy individual."

This regulation properly excludes

24

Moreover, the Court, earlier this term, summarily

23

affirmed a decision by the District Court in Connecticut in
41

I

t

Solomon versus Shapiro, which is reported at 396 U.S. 5, which

2

held the HEW regulation valid and an inconsistent Connecticut

3

practice to be invalid'.
Moreover,, we think that. HEW’s approach is consistent

4
S

with the purpose of the Act* which is to provide economic

S

security to the 5 million -5* children that are covered by this

7

act.

8

of it; it — the whole program involves expenditure of over

9

$2 billion by the Federal Government each year,, a total ex­

10

n

It's a massive act? this regulation is an important part

penditure of close to $4 billion.
'

California's statute/ we think, conflicts with this

12

regulation and since California has a statute that I earlier

13

referred to, which says that when its rules and regulations

14

IS
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

conflict, FEderaX rules shall prevail.

We think whatever the

relevance of this supremacy clause, that in this context, the
District Court improperly struck down the HEW regulation and
properly upheld the California approach.
California's approach of assuming support simply is
contrary to fact in most cases.
Moreover, it9s inconsistent with King versus Smith
for the reasons that I have indicated earlier.

There is some

language in that opinion that counsel might refer to, but that
language is always accompanied by the reference to "support
in fact,” and While the court referred to a legal obligation,
it also referred to support in fact, as coupled therewith.

42

i

The Court was referring, in King versus Smith, we

!

2

think, to a legal obligation of general applicability, not the

3

strange sort of thing that California sought to carve out„

4

Indeed, if California is right, Alabama could have avoided the

.5

decision there by just enacting a statute which said, "Okay,

6

substitute father have a legal obligation of support." -

1

Whether it was enforceable or not, what difference? it would

8

have complied.

!

How, I don’t think the Court intended that in King

9
10

versus Smith and we don't think it makes good sens®.
Q

11

I should think, to follow what California has

12

done that the family would not be eligible for AFDC grants at

13

all.
A

14
15

clusion you reach hare.
Q

16
17

I think, four Honor, that6® the ultimate con­

I mean, it would be the same as the situation in

King versus Smith.'

18

A

That's — well --

IS

Q

Because families are eligible only if one parant

20

is dead or absent.
A

n
22

25

Ifyou press it to the

ultimate, they are making these people parents, and —

23
24

That's correct.

Q

Is that our definition that they are not

A

But California doesn't want that, of coarse,

i

eligible?

43

j

1

because the statute we8 re talking about here is specifically

2

tailored to AFDC and relates only to that project, so they are

3

simply trying to reduce the benefits the people receive by

4

assumed support they get from these men without any actual

5

proof of it.
And I think that if California were pressed -- there

6

7

are some “—.a'-couple states have adopted statutes that, at

8

least as to the stepfather, place a general obligation.
As to those ~

9
10

Q

Well, that makes the family ineligible,

11

A

We would agree.

Yes, and Washington has

12

offered a statute, and I think a couple others.

13

right.

D-oes California have a general statute applying

That's quite

I couldrft really conceive of one applying to

the MARS, but stepfathers, 1 think is a feasible thing, and as
I indicated, some states do, and that makes the stepfather the

19

— the regulation itself, the first part of it which I didn't

It says: "or in relation to

a child's stepfather with ceremony remarried to the child's

the child under state law of general applicability, which re­
quires stepparents to support stepchildren to the same extent
that

natural or adoptive parents are required to support their
44

children»”

2

Q

KoWf. why would you say that was all right?

It's analogous .to the

A

Well, to the extent that there is a notion of

having stable family units, it seems to me that HEW's approach,
and not California’s fosters that, because HEW’s approach
alloxra the reduction in the amount of benefit payments only
when there’s proof of actual income.

And therefore, when there

is not actual income the MARS or the stepfather, I assume, will
continue fe© reside with the children.
Wow, to the extent that that's a value worth preser­

California’s does not?

This litigation started in the District Court.

Was it while the State and the Federal Govern­

18
A

I believe the timing, Mr. Justice, the corres­

19
20

pondence was in the summer of 1968 and the first of these two
consolidated cases was filed in October of *68.

But, as far as the STate is concerned, we had never

It hardly strikes me as an ideal way to

litigate a complex legal question to go directly on no record,

I’m not certain that it’s any more improper or

A

The. HEW regulation has two parts to it.

The

I

4

first one is the SEcrefcary's definition of who may be a parent.

Which, of course, goes to the question of: is the child a

17

Well, with some few exceptions, but generally

speaking if both parents are inthe house? ineligibility, period.
A

15
16

If the person is determined to be a parent,

there is no eligibility, with the exception of the unemployed

13
14

I know, but it doesn’t go to the question of

By definition the Social Security Act sets up

AFDC eligibility for a child who is deprived of support because
of the absence of a parent.
HEW in Subsection. A of its regulations, 203 says that

18
19
20

"The only person who can be a parent is a natural father, an
adoptive father or a stepfather, who- is legally obligated to
support the child to the same extent as a natural or adoptive

21

father.
22
If that's correct — California is not attempting to
23
defy children living with a MARS or- stepfather as nondependent
24
children.

We are not trying to call the stepfather or the MARS

25
60

?

a parent, but under HEW's definition the only thing California

2

did wrong was to limit the stepparent liability to a stepparent

3

in a welfare home,

4

California had imposed an obligation on all step­

5

fathers to support their children, then it seems to me that

6

under the HEW regulation California could determine all needy

7

children in a home with a stepfather, totally ineligible for

8

aid and it certainly escapes me how the needy child in a welfare:

9

home derives any more economic protection from the extension

10

of the stepfather liability to a stepfather in a nonwelfare

11

heme „
Q

12

Well, if you3re right, then you’re violating

13

the Federal law in a different way, because you are spending

14

Federal money which you are not authorised to spend, because

15

you are giving it to children who are ineligible under the

16

Federal statute.
A

17
18
19
20
21

22
23

24
25

Well, you can easily remedy the situation, Mr.

Justice, by simply exchanging our support our of HEW's statute
and making all stepfathers liable for the support of their
chiIdren„
Q

As I say, if you do that, then if you give any

money to a family with a stepfather, then you8re making an
unauthorised expenditure ©£ Federal money and you are violating
the Federal Law,
A

Which, to me, would be frustrative of the

61

purposes of AFDC, which is. to -impose a support obligation, on a

2

stepfather in a relatively affluent family certainly gives. no.

3

ecnomle protection to the child with a stepfather in a poor

family.

I think I can state with relative certainty,, that California

will just extend its stepfather liability statute and cut off

7

all children in stepfather homes.

If they can find him, but with the MARS, the

The other one important resource, which I think is

unique in the West, particularly in California, in the case of

As ‘this Court pointed out in King versus Smith,

if there is a legal obligation of support, proof of actual
contribution cannot be determinative.

regulation which requires proof of actual contribution is

21

invalid under that section?

Yes, because it defines a child in California

to be resourceless*

10

it’s a method of enforcement of the obligation that the state

is reducing the grant and the mother ©an say with real meanings

12

“Support me or get out."

13

And the facts of this case, the complaints in this

14

case, despite their protestations that the men are not support­

15

ing the children in the house, the complaints themselves admit

16

that, due to the emergency, as the language of the plaintiffs,

17

the Appellants use, "due to the emergency caused by this state

statute the men ©re supporting the children until the statute

is declared ..invalid."

20

The statute does work.

It is enforceable and the

21

men are supporting the children? at least some of the main

22

plaintiffs are, and the record will show that.

23

The other fact is that the — in the case of the step

I think that that is somewhat there.

Will you state it in your own way?

I think the question is, taking Ring versus

Smith, as the starting point of what is and what is not allow­
able, the child in a

home where there is a legally-"Obligated

man, a support-obligated man, a burden may fall, on that child
because the man may not be performing his duties.

program, is that the child may be harmed because of a

But» so long as he remains in the house,

the burden is the chiId8s and our essential argument is that

the Social Security Act, we submit, makes that child either
