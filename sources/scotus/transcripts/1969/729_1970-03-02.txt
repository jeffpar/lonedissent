MR. AMSTERDAM;

OS BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Number 729, Bacheliar

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This state disorderly conduct prosecution brings

to the Court three issues, of greatly varying breadth.
The narrowest relates simply to the jury instructions

'11
i2

in this particular case, and i.t is whether, on this record, and

13

in light of the trial court8s charge, the finding of the

14

offense of disorderly conduct.
The Court5s foiluTS to give certain instructions

15
16

requested by the Petitioners caused the case to go to the jury

17

on a const! tutional.Ly-impermissible basis.
The second and broader question is whether, on this

18

19

record, a conviction of these petitioners under the specific

20

definition of disorderly conduct, charged to the jury,
'

21

violates the First Amendment.

22

Maryland Disorderly Conduct Statute has been unconstitutionally

23

applied„

24
25

Or, in other words, whether the

And the third question is whether the Maryland
Disorderly Conduct Statute is unconstitutional on its face, by
2

1

virtue of the First and Fourteenth Amendments»

2

Now, all three of these questions have in common the

3

language of the offense of disorderly conduct inMaryland.

4

REsolution of any of them requires careful attention to that

5

language and I would like tostart with it»
Q

6

Just before you do, Mr. Amsterdam, because 1

7

understand the distinct category in which you put your three

8

issues in increasing breadth.

&

whether the statute on its face, was unconstitutional and

You said the last one was

10

violated the First and 14th Amendments.

11

this have to do with vagueness or breadth over-breadth or

12

vagueness or does it have to do with what the statute explicitly

13

Do you mean — does

prohibits and makes an. offense?
A

14

It has to do with the particularized standards

15

of vagueness and over-breadth, applicable in the First Amend­

16

ment area.

17

I mean unconstitutional on its face in the same sense in which

18

this Court, has looked to the facial validity of

19

when applied in areas involving speech,

20

And so when I say "unconstitutional on its face,”

statutes
~

'

I am talking about a. First Amendment contention, but
it's not related to the general doctrines of vagueness and

21

22

over-breadth.

23

vagueness and over-breadth, applicable in the First Amendment,

24

area? it is that which we invoke.

.

25

Q

There is a more particularised doctrin® of

All right,
3

1

Now, It is not unusual that in a disorderly conduct

2

area the statute itself does not contain the exhaustive

3

definition of the crime.

4

brief and it simply says: "Every person who shall be found

5

acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public

S

peace, upon any street or highway or in other public places, is

7

guilty of the offense."

8
9

The statute is found on page 4 of our

However, th& statute has been authoritatively
construed by the Maryland Court of Appeals, and at pages 30 and

10

31 of our brief, we both state those constructions and set

11

forth the portions of the specific jury charge in this case

\z

which embody the Maryland Doctrine to Disorderly Conduct.

13

And there are two distinct theories of disorderly

14

conduct in Maryland.

15

jury is: "Disorderly conduct is the doing or saying, or both

16

of that which offends, disturbs, incites or. tends to incite a

17

number of people gathered in the same area.

18

such nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons who

.

21

Q

Now, the term "peace and quiet" is linked up-

22

directly with the incitement — the incite and the peace and

23

quiet are linkedj are they not?

24

25

A

Well, it. is unclear.

Again, it's of the nature

!

of definitions of this sort, that they don't make those linkages}

4

lationship between that and inciting and disturbing, but the

4

verbal nexus is not direct»

The verbal terminology is: "conduct of such nature as
Now, I think there is a re­

S

The second — for shorthand, 1 think it may be

6

helpful to call that "the disturbing of public theory of

7

disorderly conduct/’ and I wiilrefer to it as that»
The second is the disobeying of police order theory

8

of disorderly conduct and that was charged to Petitioner's jury

9
10

as follows:

"A refusal to obey a policeman's command to move

11

on when not to do so may endanger the public peace, may amount

12

to disorderly conduct»"
Now, having focused in on the language, 1 would

13
14

propose very, very briefly to describe the facts of the case»

15

I know the Court is familiar with them? I only want to touch

16

the highlights,, and that, very briefly»
The case arises, of course, out of an anti-war

17
18

demonstration in front of a recruiting center»

There were

IS

pickets in front of the recruiting center, marching in a line? j

20

they had signs and placards»
•The Petitioners here were part of the picket line?

21

they joined the picket line and they marched with the placards ;

they were asked again to leave, both by the Recruiting Ser­

so, they were removed»
At this point the testimony begins to diverge in as

n
12

many directions as there are witnesses»

They said, they were

13

taken out and thrown bodily on the ground in a violent way»

14

The officers testified that, they were put outside? some of the

15

officers admit putting them down on their backs? others say

16

at least one landed on his feet? some say they were escorted

Does that dispute in evidence have any rele­

vancy to your point?

If you look at our brief in
"At the conclusion of the

testimony the trial court declared that the offense of dis­
orderly conduct with which they are charged, does not relate
to anything that took place inside of the office.6'

How, this

was in connection with a defense request to charge to that
effect.

The trial judge said he would charge to that effect.

He did, in fact, neglect, to charge to that effect, but that's
not a claim of ours at this point.

We raisedfchat claim below

that he should have, as a matter of state law?, but his ruling
is quite plain.

He didn't think that anything that went on
9

)

1

inside the office was part of the offense.
Indeed, the Chief Justice's point came up at the

2
3

trial? that is, whether we took the position that what went on

4

inside the office was totally immaterial.

5

counsel did take that, position and asked that the testimony

6

be stricken.

7

think that the testimony was relevant background? the court,

8

rejected thatposition, but the court rejected it specifically

9

on the ground, that this was relevant background and not that

street.
Q

Now, there were 25 or 30 other people who had,

been picketing on the street for a fairly long period of time
while your clients were in the office? is that correct?
A

That's correct, both before and after.

The picketers included the six defendant petitioner
here and when they went in — they were in there, remember,
10

T

for about an hour — the picketing continued and from what it

2

appears, 'die petitioner were in and out and other people were

And then they were thrown out.

They were the ones who had stayed.

Now, the point is, 1 think --

7

Q

You spoke of them marching in a line.

Now,

8

some of the pictures indeed show they were marching in a line,

9

but Exhibit. 9, which is one of the exhibits here, is not much

of a linei; would you say?

n

spilling out onto the street, and indeed, spilling out to the

12

point where, although there are parking meters there, no car

13

could be parked there at the time that the activity was going

14

on.
A

15

The crowd in front of the store,

Let us be clear on timing, Mr. Justice.

I

16

wasn9t responding to that question? I was talking about the

picketing.

18

Exhibit 9 refers to the time —

The picketing had ceased by the time of Exhibit 9.

19

Q

What was going on at the time of Exhibit 9?

20

A

The six petitioner had been thrown out of the

2!

office arid were on the sidewalk in front of it.

At that time

22

a crowd composed of the other demonstrators,that i_ . the
!

23

picketers, and onlookers, gathered around to watch.

24

clear on the record, whether, or .not that crowd of onlookers

25

was already obstructing the sidewalk in the way in which you

when they were thrown out.

That is not a. picket line# Your

That is a crowd of people; no picketing in the

3

sense that you were talking about, at all, except that your

6

clients are still engaged in their demonstration; aren't they?
A

7

They are at that point, depending on the view

8

one takes of the testimony, which was never resolved by the

9

jury? either still engaged in a demonstration or lying on the

10

ground where they were thrown, because they haven't yet had a

Now, the response of others here somatimes is peace­

ful, just curiosity, an interest in what's going on and some­
times it might be more than that»

But the response is part of

the statute? is it not?
A

Thera is no doubt about that, unless the public

responds in

I

clear to me whether that’s so.

and see«

Let me take the statute apart

In one sense response is necessary.

That is, under

the definition of disorderly conduct which involves doing

5

something which offends,, disturbs, or incites, the reaction, of

the crowd is relevant.

Q

What I'm concerned about is what it

Q

They were there

to guarantee their rights to

picket and parade up and down the front of the recruiting

17

office?
A

18

Absolutely no question about it.

Your Honor,,

19

I want to make very clear our position here, which both the

20

Court below misunderstood and the Respondent appears to mis­

21

understand.

22

arrested because the police disagreed with their views? they

23
24
25

were not.

We are not contending that these petitioners were

We don’t suggest that for one moment.

What we

suggest is two things: first of all, what is in issue before
this Court is not the reason for their arrest.
13

What’s involved

1

before this Court is the basis for their conviction and they

2

were convicted on the theory that they did something which

3

offended, disturbed and incited,

4

obstructing the sidewalk or any basis for the police arrest,
Secondly, the offense of disturbing and inciting has

5
6

It had nothing to do with

to do with the crowds response to their ideas.

ing the police disagreed with their ideas; we're saying that

8

the police arrested them because they disturbed,the crowd.

9

What Your Honor is saying, Mr, Justice, is exactly right, that

10

this offense turns in large part, not exclusively, on the

tl

crowd * s reaction.
And what has happened in this case is that the crowd
Why?

13

reacted with hostility to the petitioners,

14

of their position on the street? because of their position on

15

Vietnam.

Mot because

IS

a result of that hostility the police then proceeded to arrest

17

them for creating a disturbance.

That's plain, on the State's own testimony.

And as

18

Now, it is the purpose of disorderly conduct to pre~

19

vent the public from being upset; and it is the purpose of the

20

First Amendment to prevent disorderly conduct laws from allow­

21

ing convictions where the upset is ideological.

22

essence of our submission in this case.

That is the

23

Now, I want to be very clear about the issues pre­

24

sented, because in my view, the respondent takes a very dif­

25

ferent view of the issues than Petitioner,
14

j

We8re not say- j

7

12

j

And I think who is

1

ultimately right on the merits of this case depends in large

2

part, if not exclusively, on whose formulation off the issues

3

if the correct one.

4

exactly what 1 think the issues are.

For that reason I want to tell the Court

The question here is not whether these petitioners

S
6

have done .something for which Maryland can constitutionally

7

punish,

S

to sit in a recruiting office; it is not whether they have a'

0

right to sit down on the sidewalk; it is not whether they have

Mora specifically, it is not whether they have a right

10

a right to obstruct the sidewalk,

n

they have any of those rights,

I am not asserting that

12

What they have a right to is a fair trial on the

13

issue whether they did any of those things under a statute

14

which, in terms, punishes doing those things, so that the issue

'15

submitted to the jury and fairly decided by the jury will be

16

whether the Petitioners did anything

17

constitutional right to punish.

*

Maryland had a

Now, that is not this trial and that is not this

18
19

statute.

20

agree with the Respondent’s statement of the issues in this

21

case.

22

obstructed the sidewalk, they were told to move on; therefore,

23
24
25

And, it is for this reason that we profoundly dis­

The Respondents make it a simple case; Petitioners

they were charged with refusing to move on after being told to J
:

do so because they were obstructing the sidewalk and that’s a
perfectly constitutional charge.
15

1

The trouble with that is that the first time

2

Petitione.1® have been charged with that is in this Court, and

3

if 1 may refer to the record, I think I can satisfy the Court

4

pretty squarely on that point.

5

specifically? in their brief iss "Petitioners were - arrested for

6

blocking the sidewalk and for failure to obey a policeman * s

7

command to move on, when not to do so may endanger the public

8

peace."

9

What the Respondents say,

An examination of the record clearly discloses that

10

obstruction of the sidewalk was the prevailing factor that

it

caused the arrest of the Petitioners, not disagreement with

12,

their ideas.

13

I think X have already pointed out that the issue

14

here is not what they were arrested for; it's what they have

15

been convicted for.

16

were convicted for? one ought to look at another aspect of the

17

Respondent8s brief.

18

'

And at this point, when one asks what they

The Respondent points out at page 42 that the prose­

19

cutor elected not to proceed under a Maryland statute governing

20

obstruction of the streets.

21

immaterial that the State didn't proceed under that statute.

22

I suggest that the fact that the State didn't proceed under that

23

statute is the essence of this ease.

Now, that charge, as X say, has two aspects; doing

And this was

With all the facts, including, Mr. Justice, the

7
8

background facts like the fact that these people were walking

9

with signs and that they were singing "We Shall Overcome,"

10

when they were on the street.
Now, the State, even in this Court, calls their

12

singing on the sidewalk, misplaced vocalising and suggests

13

that it was disorderly because it prevented them front hearing

police orders.

saying that.

16

want and I don't violate this statute unless I offend, disturb,

You don't think I'm disturbing anybody who wants

to use the sidewalk if I block the sidewalk completely?

I have no doubt that you would be disturbing

those people who want to use it.

Well, then, why isn't that covered by the statute ?

Because the statute —

6

it's not simply a< matter of disturbing; it is a matter of

7

acting in a disorderly manner to the disturbance of the public

9

from engaging in his own pursuits.

That doesn't simply mean disturbing any individual
The notion of disturbing

10

the public peace is one with which courts have struggled for

11

a long feline and this Court witnessed State Court definitions

12

of disturbing the peace in Cox and Edwards,

It's a very

3

different thing from simply disturbing somebody who wants to

4

walk along the street.

5

And, in any event, the whole purpose of the

Petitioner's request to the jury, request to charge the jury

7

would have been to limit the statute to exactly that.

that the statute is not clear in what it means.

There is one other thing I should respond to,

Court may well assume when it comes to this case and I want to

be very clear; 1 don’t think it’s a fair assumption, and that is

12

the assumption that these people sat on the sidewalk.
Wow,, I'm not, as I said in my brief: I'm not going to

14

be evasive about that.

15

and I think this would be a different case if the way this case

the question of whether or not the defendants0 conduct offended-

would be totally incomprehensible.

liability, one of which was; knowingly and purposely engaging

in actions they had no lawful right to do and which obstructed

of our appendix, our instructioning would have defined in

17

precisely Mr. Justice White’s terms “obstructing traffic."

had voted against these Petitioners, we wouldn’t we here.

That wouldn't be this case.

the sidewalk, but a broader one,

But what was submitted to the jury

Now, there is ons aspect of the court's charge that

may seem to submit that, question.

21

It is not in the portion

i

<1
ii

describing the defense case , and I want to take an aside one

2

moment to point out that the court summarized the evidence

3

here, as well as gaing instructions on the law.
When it summarised the prosecution9s case, you would

4
5

think at least it would mention obstruction if obstruction is

6

an issue, even though that wasn't wasn't a legal element, but

7

they didn't even talk about obstruction.

8

There is nothing, either in the instructions to the

B

jury on the law, nor on the summary, even of the prosecutor's

10

case, which suggests that obstruction was an issue here, and

n

therefore, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether they sat

12

there or whether they obstructed anything was not resolved by

13

the jury.
Mow, one quibble that one might have with that is

14

15
16

this; there is, in stating the defense case, a statement that;
"The position of the defense is that they didn't hear the

17

command of the officers to get up and move.

18

case they had a right to sit on the sidewalk, or in the case

19

of one or two who had been restrained there by the hand of the

20

officer.4’

21

22
23
24
25

If that is the

But, notice that the jury charge submits two theories
of liability; offending, disturbing and inciting is one and the
other is refusing to move on.

This says that they had a right

to sit on the sidewalk, i.e., not to move on if they didn't
hear the instruction of the officer.

If doesn't say anything

i

about whether they5re guilty or not guilty under the first
theory»

And it is perfectly consistent that the jury, in

3

resolving this case, Mr» Chief Justice, found that although

4

they did not roughly sit down, they were thrown there by the

S

officers; although they did not have a chance to get up or

6

although they were held down, which is their testimony, that

7

nevertheless, they did something that offended, disturbed and

incited a crowd.

Yes, Your Honor; there is such a rule in

Then of what relevance are the instructions of

Maryland.

• the trial judge?
A

They are supposed to be merely advisory, but

inasmuch as the Court of Appeals of Maryland has held that a

•:
5

23

1

conviction is reversible if the advisory instructions are wrong

2

it seems very clear that this Court would have to say, as a

3

matter of Federal Law, whether the instructions were wrong,

4

and if they were wrong, then the judgment wouldhave to be re­

5

versed.

6

Q

Well, 1 just wondered in a case — and I think

7

perhaps the unique situation in Maryland where the jury is

8

made the judge of both facts arid the law, whether our decisions

9

coming from other jurisdictions "where that is far from true,

10

n

are completely relevant,
A

I have no doubt that if the Court were disposed

12

to treat Maryland differently than any other jurisdiction for

13

that purpose that Maryland's whole law of disorderly conduct

14

would have to be unconstitutional.

15

would be to deprive this Court of imposing legal restrictions

16

on the formulation of rules in the First Amendment area and

17

that very deprivation would cause inevitably the kind of

18

vagueness and overbreadth which this Court has held bad when

19

applied to First Amendment, conduct.

20

Because what that would do

If it really is true, and I simply do not take it

21

seriously, because frankly, the Maryland Court of Appeals

22

doesn't take it seriously, that the jury is a judge of the facts; .

23

For all ordinary trial purposes it isn’t.

and argue and the jury is told that they axe, and that sort of

25

thing, but as this Court pointed out in Brady and as the Giles

Counsel can get up

1

?

opinion that it refers to in Brady pointed outs

"All ordinary

2

rules of review are applicable in Maryland.

If the instruction

3

is wrong,, the jury judgment gets reversed."

That's all that's

4

in issue here.
This is a matter of Federal Constitutional Law.

5

This

6

instruction is wrong and rendered wrong because of the refusal

7

to give the requested charges and if so, Maryland Law itself,

8

says that this judgment has to be reversed.

12

ATTORNEY GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. LENTZs

Mr. Chief Justice, and Associate
i

H

Justices, may it please the Courts

Before addressing myself

i5

to the principal issue raised by Petitioners, namely that they

16

were tried for the wrong crime, it-would assist the State's

17

presentation if the Court would permit the State to present

IS

their argument first from, the standpoint of the application of

19

the statute to the Petitioners by reviewing the actual facts

20

involved.
Secondly, considering the issue of vagueness, which

21

22

Petitioner has raised, and finally, from the instructions to

23

the jury.

24
25

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Mr. Lents, would you raise
your voice a little?
25

1

MR» LENTS :

2

This is siot a complicated case.

Certainly.
However, the facts

3

must be considered in detail to present a — to arrive at a

4

proper legal determination.

that this is a disorderly conduct case, not a freedom of speech;J

9

public peace, on the streets in the City of Baltimore,

13

cution,

14

a minimum of 35 to 40 demonstrators, whose activities were

15

peaceful, were not arrested, but on the contrary, they received

16

police protection and were granted complete freedom to picket

17

an army recruiting office and distribute literature to un­

IS

sympathetic onlookers,

19

However, their

This position is established bythe recognition that

Only when the Petitioners sat down on a ten to 12-

20

foot-wide sidewalk in a commercial section of the city, blocked

21

it as a public passageway, refused officers8 request to move,

22

were they arrested for disorderly conduct.

23
24
25

These demonstrators could still be picketing if the
Petitioners had not laid down on the sidewalk.
Q

I take it that Baltimore has no anti-picketing

law?

S

A

That3 s correct.

6

Q

7

8
9
10

That is correct to the best of my knowledge ,

Is there a law or ordinance about disobeying the

order of an officer?
A

No* Your Honor; there is a state law which is

embodied in the interpretation of 62 Article 27 Section 123,,
which is your State disorderly conduct statute»

n

Q

l‘t isn't a separate one just for that alone?

12

A

Not to my knowledge; no* sir.

13

Q

But there is a statute* as 1 understand it*

14

making it an offense to obstruct a street or sidewalk?

15

A

Yes* sir.

That is Section 121 of Article 27»

16

Now* the thrust of Petitioner's argument is that

17

their arrest and prosecution was based on an expression of their

18

political views and ideas.

19

that the arrest and their conviction was based on disorderly

20

conduct and the vehicle used for the prosecution, namely:

21

Article 27, Section 123, is a valid constitutional vehicle.

22
23
24

The Respondent, of course, argues

At the outset, the Respondent would emphasise to the
Court that this case does not present the fighting words of
Chaplinsky; it is not a racial arrest that wss patently illegal,.
■

25

such as we had in Shuttlesworth, Cox and Edwards.

27

It is not a

1

pure speech case, such as we had in Terminello.

2

peaceful picketing as was in Gregory.

3

simply an instance where the conduct of the six petitioners

4

was disorderly.
Q

5

It Is not a

The case is purely and

Well, could I ask you then; surely the statute

8

and the instructions to the jury would permit convictions for

7

saying anything to disturb someone; and the instructions

8

specifically permitted the jury to convict on that basis?

A

Yes *

them to do so, then we don't know on what basis they convicted

There would be no baelg for arriving at that

level, Your Honor, because the only words brought out were the

Now» the State's position is that this disturbance
on the sidewalk was caused directly by the Petitioners

This blockage of the side™

as five requests were made: three by one officer and two by

another.

As many

The Petitioners took the position that they did not

Now, an explanation is offered that

volume that the Petitioners did not hear the officers6 request.
Nevertheless, a surrebutal witness, one Fogarty, a

15

with which the Petitioners were charged.

Certainly, if our

State6s Attorney is to possess any degree of discretion, he is

the one that makes the decision as to what particular statute

he will charge the accused of.

IS

where the accused is going to select the statute that he wishes

to be prosecuted by; certainly he was in violation of 121, the

21

blockage ofthe sidewalk, but certainly he was in violation of

Number one, the disorderly conduct violation occurred
when he hit the. sidewalk and remained in that position.

for which it was intended; namely; the free passage by

They must make a

24

And the question: Is this statute as interpreted by the Maryland

25

Court of Appeals, void for vagueness?

A problem exists, admittedly, in drafting any

Now, the State would submit that the interpretation

given to this statute by the Maryland Court of Appeals is fair

prohibited and this interpretation is:

the crime of disorderly conduct as it was in the cases of

"Also it has been held that failure to obey a

policeman’s command to move on or not to do so may endanger the

25

In considering whether this statute, as interpreted,
36

1

is sufficiently clear to a person with common intelligence.

I

2

would first remind the Court that the Petitioners in this case

-*J>

are all college students or college, graduates and no suggestion

4

has been made that they lacked common intelligence.
This Court, however, has twice considered the

5

6

Maryland disorderly conduct statute in the Drews cases in e64

7

and 965 and no quarrel was found with its constitutionality on

8

the vagueness issue.
The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, in decid­

9
10

ing this case, made specific reference to the findings cf this

11

Court in Drews.
Mow, let’s consider the other — the enactments of

12

13

other states and attempt to draw a comparison with the Maryland

14

statute.

15

brief, the state has attempted to offer for this Court8s

W

consideration the disorderly conduct statutes of all the states

17

and also the All Model Penal Code disorderly conduct statute.

18

Set down on pages 55 through 69 of the Respondent’s

They all seem to be strikingly similar in their

19

wording and X would certainly submit that the common mart would

20

have less difficulty, considerable less difficulty in under­

21

standing, comprehending and applying this disorderly conduct

22

statute to himself than he would many, many other statutes,

23

including, if I might also suggest, our income tax regulations.

24
25

Simple generic terms have been used in the statute
and these express to a man of common intelligence what is

37

!

necessary or what is prohibited.

1 would suggest that the

Ten Commandments are expressed, in the simplest of terms, yet
3

they are completely understandable to the sinner, although

4

theologians might experience some difficulty in agreeing orp the

3

interpretation.
The same might apply to the disorderly conduct

6
1

statute.

I don't think that the common man would experience

8

any difficulty in applying this statute.

9

judges might well contest its specific meaning, as they have

10

been doing for centuries over such terms as: "probable cause,

11

due process, reasonable, competent, fair or proper."

However lawyers or

2 would refer this Court to the words of Justice

IE
13

Frankfurter in Addison versus Holly Hill where he stated: "

14

"Legislation when not expressed in technical terms is addressed

15

to the common run of men and is therefore to be understood

16

according to the sense of the thing,

as the ordinary man has

17

a right to rely on ordinary words addressed to him,,"
This Court has, in the recent past, considered

18

19

similar disorderly conduct statutes in Swicker versus Boll,

20

in the Woodward case, which is cited in the State's brief,

21

22

25

while the Second Circuit considered a similar Illinois statute.
And in neither instance were these statutes held to be void for
vagueness.

the issue was whether statutory overbreadth in a Kentucky

I would point out that all instruction's in criminal

7

8

cases given by judges to juries in Maryland are advisory only.

9

Maryland is one of two states having this provision in its

10

constitution.

This Court has taken cognisance of this proced­

that the Court need not grant any requested instructions if the
