!
The defendant here was indicted for failing to report

There was a trial before a jury, at which the

defendant testified.

The jury returned a verdict of "guilty."

the defendant said that he could not participate in the Vietnam j
War without doing violence to the dictates of his conscience.
And he further stated that he cannot qualify as a
conscientious objector within the meaning of the Military
j
Selective Service Act of 1967, because he is not a pacifist and,
in any event, his conviction that the Vietnam War is illegal,
immoral and unjust is not based on religious training and belief.

We do not dispute that the appellee was sincerely and conscien­

9

victions, educational training, extensive reading both about

10

Vietnam and such things as the 0. N. Charter and the Nfirnberg

trial.

12

As I have indicated, his claim is selective, not

13

against war in any form, as the phrase is in the statute, and

14

he expressly asserts that it is not based on religious training

and belief.

In this situation the District Court held that the

appellee had a valid claim to be constitutionally exempted from

combat in the Vietnam type of situation.

Do you think this is a motion for arrest of judg­

21

A

Well, this is the subject to which I am about, to

22

address my argument.

23

first half of ray argument is devoted to jurisdiction and the

24

second half to selective conscientious objection.

25

I was trying to give the setting, and the

The Court, concluded that the Military Selective Service

that, in the alternative; Section 6(j) of the exemption provi­

objection.
From this decision the United States took this appeal
purporting to act under the second clause of the Criminal Appeal
Act of 1907 now found in. Title XV1I1 o£ the United States Code,
Section 3731, the relevant: passages from which are set out on
page 13 of the Government brief.
And now I will turn to the jurisdictional question,
v/nich in my mind is a very close question.
We contend that there is jurisdiction,, but good argu­
ments can be made both ways.

There is no doubt that there was

a trial here and if there had been a verdict of "notguilty,"
even a directed verdict of "not guilty," there could be no appeal
no matter what error of law was made by the trial court.
An illustration of that is found in the case decided
just last month in United States against Bowen, which is set out.
in an appendix to one of the briefs filed by amicus curiae, the
one by the Los Angeles Selective Service law panel.

In the

Bowen case Judge Wygarl directed a verdict for the defendant,
who was a selective conscientious objector, based, on religious
training and belief.
We think that .'Judge Wygal was wrong as a matter of law,

i

but there is nothing we can. do about it and we have, of course,,

z

taken no appeal,

o

The difference is that here there was a verdict of

4

"guilty" followed by a motion in arrest of judgment, which was

5

granted»

20

Now if Judge Wyzanski had entered an order saying,

evidence to submit to the jury and the case should not have been
allowed to go to the jury, and accordingly I direct the judgment
of acquittal be entered," I think we would be so close to the
situation in the Bowen case that we couldn’t talk about it„
And it is easy, I think, to say that what Judge Wyzan­
ski did was not different in substance from that, and that sum­
marises the difficulty of our position on the jurisdiction,

Well, there is one important difference, though,

in that the verdict and judgment stand now, does it not?

(Laughter)

In this situation we have concluded, not without diffi­

16

There is no genuine difference between this case

stipulated to on a motion to dismiss.
We think, too, that the decision below is one on the

17

construction of Section 12(a) of the Selective Service Act.

18

Less clearly, we think that the Court decision with respect to

W

Section 6(j) comes within the Criminal Appeals Act.

of the statute.

We are not prepared to dispute this contemporaneous

understanding and the interpretation of the Act, which has

22

obtained since 1907.

23

24
25

It is true that the statute has been

amended, particularly when, it was codified in 1908 — 1948.

But

the revisers noted at that time, make it plain that the changes
then made were editorial only and were not intended to alter

the scope of review.
Over the years the Department of Justice has repeatedly

sought to get the statute changed. I might, say modernized, and

No, Jr. Justice,, it is just hard to gets things

10

through Congress even when there is no objection.

11

McCulloch, the ranking minority member of the House Judiciary

12

Committee, is interested in this now and we have hopes that he

will make some progress not only on this, but on the statutes

This Court has so said quits clearly in Hamilton against the

This is on pages 44 and 45 of our

from an opinion of Judge Augustus Hand* who I think 1 may appro-!
prlately say is perhaps my favorite Federal judge.

20

There is a distinction between a course of reasoning

The latter and net the former may be the basis of
exemption under the Act* and it surely never occurred to Judge

Hand that there was any legal question lying behind that state-

The former is usually a political objection; for the

4

latter we think may justly be regarded as a response of the

5

individual to an inward mentor.

has ever decided and. seems to me would be wholly unwarranted

And there are extensive arguments in

1©

If that provision was given such sweeping scope, it

17

would of necessity extend beyond the Selective Service Act to

16

other areas, such as the payment of taxes or to people who had

19

conscientious scruples against racial equality.

And I have no
i

20

doubt that there are such people whose conscience is perfectly

21

clear on that matter, unless the Fourteenth Amendment was held

22

to have pro tanto repealed the First Amendment, which seems a

23

curious reversal operation of those provisions.
Such a construction of the First Amendment is without

24

25

precedent.

It would be wholly destructive of the orderly

functioning of government, and it would undermine the essential <
integrity of the democratic process.
It is true, of course, that we are a constitutional

5

principles is majority rule.

Would

you see any difference in the posture of the basic claims of

this appellant and that of a taxpayer who refused to pay any
taxes so long as some of the taxes were being used to maintain,
a war that he objected to on the same grounds?
A

14

Well, no, Mr. Justice, that is essentially the

15

argument I was just trying to make, that pressing the First

16

Amendment to establish a constitutional right of free conscience

17

19

could not be limited to the Selective Service Act. It could
'
apply to all across the board anything which a person sincerely j
I
i
conscientiously objects to. He would be protected in his objec­

20

tion by the Constitution, including as far as I can see.

21

of course, would be another issue to be argued before the Court j

22

the premise is that the Constitution protects peoples in con­

would follow that a citizen could refuse to pay either any taxes

7

and his taxes could go into a fund which couldn't be used for

8

10

defense purposes and other people’s taxes would go into the
defense fund.
It seems to me that pressing the general language

n

of the First Amendment that far would be pushing it to a dry,

12

illogical extreme.

13

And, finally, we contend that the provision made by

14

Congress does not violate the Fifth Amendment.

15

rationally distinguish between persons opposed to war in any

18

form and those whose objections extend only to a particular war

Congress could

by the duly elected representatives of the Government is wrong

Except for the Courts below and Judge Wygal in the

What's the excuse?

A

I recognise that if that Ccise came, and in some

ways it is almost presented in the Bowen case.

The Bowen case

involves a sincere Catholic, who following certain teaching of

©

the church with respect to just and unjust wars, and concluded

i

I

that this was an unjust war and that he could not participate
11

in it.

And I need not make it plain that I have no question

12

whatever about the sincerity of his beliefs or about the sin-

13

cerity of Sisson's beliefs.

■

It is our position that this is a judgment which not

14

16

Congress to make.

raise

22

We have not only the First, Amendments we have

And I would suppose that that would be true even though

20
21

;

Congress repealed the religious training and belief exception,
which it seems to me they might do.

Australia and Great Britain

Congress.

the amended language?

ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. S. FLYM, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

21

MR. FLYM:

May it please the Court;

22

I would like, first, to address myself to the question

23

whether the decision arresting judgment of conviction was, in

24

fact, entered by the Court below.

23

the Government8s brief at pages 7 and 8 states, "Appellee's

before this Court today that the Government agreed with our

position that what the judge, in fact, granted was a motion in

I think that assumption is supported by

the record.

18

Q

■ this appears at page 197 of the
That

Could that motion have been, made under the rules

after the entry of the judgment?
A

Yes, it would.

G

In other words, is it broad enough to allow a

27

1

motion in arrest of the execution of the judgment?
A

2

I think Rule 34 expressly limits the time within

3

which a motion and arrest of judgment, can be made to a period

4

of ten days following the verdict of "guiltyp" or within such

5

period of time as the Court allows,

would be filed.

Moreover,

the docket in the case is reproduced at the beginning of the rsc 3ri
on appeal at pages 3, 4 and 5, as a matter of fact, as an indi­
cation spelling out the judgment, the decision of the District
Court as follows:

"The defendant with his counsel and Govarnmen t

counsel present, the Court reads it opinion granting defendant’s
motion in arrest of judgment pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal

16

Rules of Criminal Procedure„"

17

words of Rule 34, the indictment of Sisson does not charge an

18

offense.

Excerpt quoted below:

of the statute upon which the indictment is found within the

Then the docket continues and concludes, "Court orders

motion in arrest of judgment entered forthwith.”

It reall f

is quite persuasive that the intent of the draftsmen of the
Criminal Appeals Act was precisely to confer upon this Court
jurisdiction in all cases which were not precluded by the Consti­
tution by reason of the double jeopardy clausa.
I have in mind, for instance, and I am simply select­
ing at randomly, on page 22 of the Government's brief there is a
quotation from Senator Bacon, which indicates that the jeopardy
clause was inserted in the motion in bar subdivision out of an
abundance of caution.

The caution, I suggest to the Court, in

context was simply that they wanted to be quite clear that they
were not purporting to grant jurisdiction in cases which was
constitutionally prescribed.
There is a reference to the purpose which the statute
was intended to serve on that same case, on. page 22 of the brief.
The purpose was simply to meet the problem of having district
court judges dismissing criminal prosecutions,

Particularly

there was a case against Chicago Meatpeakers where the Court

29

1

dismissed the proceedings and the Government was powerless to doj

z

anytiing about it.

the Criminal Appeals Act.
To simply avoid this result, namely, of providing

14

case is the prototype of the situation which the draftsmen of

15

the Criminal Appeals Act could not possibly have intended to

16

result in precluding review by this Court,

17
18
19

It seems to me that the present

And it would simply be much too easy to circumvent
the purpose of the Act.
Wow on page 23 Senator Nelson especially says, and I

20

am quoting the quotation.

Nelson said that the plea in bar

21

section it was made clear, "out of extreme caution,5' that "where!

22

the defendant has been put in jeopardy he can not be reindicted.
The emphasis again was again on the question of whethe.l:

23
24

the defendant, having filed whatever motion he filed and having

25

that motion granted by the Court, whether he could be reindicted:

1

I don’t think there is any question or is there any suggestion

t

by the Government that in circumstances where a defendant files

a motion in bar or a motion in arrest of judgment, that he could;

Now we assert that the order as such, which precedes
any assignment to any fie lie of duty, whether to Paris or to
Vietnam or any other location, we assert that that order was
in and of itself invalid for a variety of reasons.

I would in the time remaining this afternoon simply
like to address myself to two points,

One will be in passing,

#

I will refer to a recent hook written by a man named Ronald
Berger, entitled "Congress against the Supreme Court,-" in which j
I the point is made, I think quite convincingly, that judicial

I!

i

review in this Court is not a matter of usurpation by this CourtL

j
j but was something intended very definitely by the framers of
the Constitution precisely to provide a safeguard against encroach
raent of individual liberty by Congress.
I would only like to refer to two quotationst- one ir.
from page 31 of this book- - it is a 1969 book

by Jefferson.

Jefferson in 1781 stated that 173 despots would surely be as
oppressive as one, and elective despotism- was not the government
we fought for»
Similarly Madison, in dealing with the purpose of the

■

Bill of Rights, stated these amendments are incorporated into
the Constitution,,

Independent tribunals of justice will con-

;
eider themselves in a peculiar manner guardians of those rights.1
j
We will ha an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of
J
power in the Legislative or the Executive.
Now, the notion that the Federal Congress might

arrogate to itself powers and infringe individual liberty was

something of which the framers were very, very conscious»,

were concerned principally about the Federal Congress»

But they knew nothing whatsoever about this new organ

this Federal Legislature that was to sit at times 1,000 miles

8

away from some parts of this vast land,, and the people were

9

afraid that precisely the Federal Government would reach out

u

and deprive them of fundamental liberty.
For this purpose this Court was vested with judicial

review, the power of deciding whether has exceeded the limits

13

of its powers, of its limited delegated powers conferred by the

Constitution.

This doctrine was asserted repeatedly throughout

the time of the ratification and framing of the Constitution.
That is set out in the Berger book.
It was reiterated by this Court in Luther against
Gordon in the middle of the 19th Century.
The only other point that I wish to make is the
repeated insistance by the Solicitor General to history, that
on the basis of the history surrounding the adoption of the Bili
of Rights there is no basis for this Court concluding that reli
gion stands for the ’’rights of conscience."
I submit, and 1 do it diffidently

I refer, in particular,, to Declarations of Sights
made by the Conventions of New York, Rhode Island, North Caro­
lina and Virginia.

These Declarations assert the existence of

certain inalienable rights and make it clear that the Constitu­
tion was being ratified only with the expressed understanding
that these rights were not infringed by the Constitution.
That was prior to the adoption of the Bill of Rights.
One of these rights was;

"That the people have an equal, natur a 1

and unalienable right, freely and peaceably to Exercise their
Religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no
Religious Sect or Society ought to be favoured or established
by Law in preference of others."

Well, how does that fit into this case?

is, it is an inaccurate statement to describe Sisson as a

conscientious objector, and the very necessity for making that

10

distinction between a religious objector — or rather, a non-

11

religious objector and a nonreligious conscientious objector is

12

the fact that the Act, as the Solicitor General so ably defended

13
14

it, makes that distinction.
It does not extend the scope of the exemption in the

IS

Act to the full measure of protection afforded religion under

16

the First Amendment.
