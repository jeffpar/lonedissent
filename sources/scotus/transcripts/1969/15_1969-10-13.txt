MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM G. LINE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. LINE:

io

No. 15, DeBacker against

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case involves the question of whether equal
justice under law means for adults only.
Clarence DeBacker is in the Nebraska State Reformatory

12

as the result of a petition filed against him in the Juvenile

Id

Court of Dodge County, Nebraska, alleging his delinquency be-

14

cause of the possession of a forged check with the intention of

15

uttering it as genuine.

16

A jury trial was demanded and denied because the

17

Nebraska Juvenile Court Act. says that juvenile delinquency cases

18

will be handled without a jury, and the quantum of proof is by

'19

a preponderance of the evidence.

20

Habeas corpus was sought in the court of general juris­

2!

diction, it was denied, and the Nebraska Supreme Court, in a

22

4-to-3 decision — it was the type of decision where the minority

23

prevailed — held that the Nebraska Juvenile Court Act met

24

Federal constitutional requirements.

25

Nebraska has a State constitutional provision requiring
3

I

a concurrence of five judges to declare a State statute in­

2

valid.

3

The position of the appellant in this case has been

4

referred to by some of the adversaries in amicus curiaes as

5

being simplistic.

6

if is precisely that.

Without the evil connotations of the word,

Since this Court’s decisions in Duncan, in Bloom, in

7
S

Gault, a proceeding where a person can wind up in a penal in­

9

stitution for more than six months, surely has all the attri­
butes of a serious felony case.

10

11

Q

When was he tried?

12

A

He was tried in April — actually February or

March 1963, before Duncan and Bloom were decided.

13

Q

14

How do you argue on retroactivity of Duncan and

Bloom, or do you think they are evcjn relevant?

13

A

16

retroactivity.

17

Q

18

I don't think they are even relevant on the
I realize that they are not retroactive.
Because up until Duncan and Bloom, I suppose you

19

would say the Stata was not bound by the jury trial provision

20

at all?

21

A

Right,

22

Q

At all.

And DeStefano said that Duncan and

Bloom would not be retroactive beyond what — May 20, 1368 is- 11?

23

A

24

Mny 20, 1968.

This case was all argued in the

Nebraska Supreme Court on May 29, 1968.

25

i

t

1

2

Q

Fiat DeStefano said that in trials beginning aftei

May 20, 1968 *

3

A

Right.

4

Q

So how do you get around that?

5

A

Gault left open the question of whether a juven­

e
7

Mr. Justice White, the position

ile de.liaqu.ey case was, in fact, a criminal case.
Q

That is true, but even if it was the Sixth

8

Amendment, it wouldn't bind the states to give a jury trial at

9

the time of Gault.

10

A

They wouldn't at the time of Gault, but —

1!

Q

And it wouldn’t until May 20, 1968?

12

A

My argument is based on this premise:

that —

13

Q

Or did it rely on the Sixth Amendment

at all?

14

A

15

Q

And on the equal protection clause.

16

A

And on the equal protection clause.

17

Q

If the State does, in fact, give a jury trial to

'

c8
19

20
21

Oh, you have to rely on the sixth Amendment.

adults, then it must to juveniles situated as this ona was.
A

For example, an adult in Nebraska, due to the

Nebraska constitutional procedures and statutory decisions can
get two jury trials for running a stop sign, a 6-man jury in the

22

lower court and a 12-man jury on appeal to the District Court..

23

So that argument, also, we do rely on, of course.

24
23

It seems to me that this is a nev7 case, basically,
and until this Court decides this question, this is the case

5

5

that should decide once and for all whether these labels that

2

everyone is so fond of mean anything any more.

3

What this case is not about, of course, is the

4

rehabilitative features of the Juvenile Court.

5

pointed out, in ray opinion, any reason why a jury trial or an

6

adjudication based upon a criminal standard of proof will inter­

7

fere one wit with the noble, benevolent features of the juvenile

8

court system.

9

Ho one has

For example, I can imagine a juvenile court judge who

10

has a delinquent before him being able to ba much more parens

11

patriae if he hasn't convicted him..

12

have been convicted by a jury of your peers.

13

what we can do about you, son,” and the juvenile is apt to feel

14

less resentment at the juvenile court process if he has been

15

convicted by his fellow citizens with a standard of proof beyond

16

a reasonable doubt,

17

Q

Surely he can say, "You
Now let's see

What would you say if it was turned around the

18

other way, that the judge might think he ought to be convicted,

19

but the jury would say, "Well, this boy is a youngster. We are

20

not going to convict him"?

21

22

A

That, I think, Mr. Justice Harlan, is the magic

of the whole system.

23

Q

Is what?

24

A

Is the magic of the whole system.

! is the reason he ought to have it.
An*c/

6

1 think that

Very occasionally judges

1

think people ebonId be convicted and juries think they should

2

not, and that is the way it works out.
Q

•%>

4

Why have juvenile courts at all?

Why not turn

them over to the adult authorities?
A

5

It seems to me that if a juvenile court system

Q

means anything at all, the theory, as I understand it, is that

7

you are not supposed to punish him? you are supposed to rehabill

8

tate him.

9

be arriving at that theory, too, not the thumb screw and the

c

10

Of course, modern penology, I think, is supposed to

rack, and so forth.

We are interested in rehabilitation.

It seems to me that the juvenile court can still func­

11

12

tion; that merely because you give a boy a constitutional right

13

to be tried by a jury, you don't then necessarily have to take

14

away from him whatever benefits yet remain.

♦

Q

15

Wasn't one of the purposes of the whole, juvenile

IS

concept to spare the child, ths juvenile, from the traumatic

17

experience that accompanies the whole criminal process, from

18

indictment to the prison; that is, spare him from, among other

19

things, the panoply of a jury trial?

20

of the conceivers?

21

with it.

Wasn’t that in the minds

I am not talking about whether you agree

Wasn't that the conception?

22

A

N© question about it.

23

Q

Would you agree that the jury trial can be a

24
25

traumatic experience for both an adult and a child?
A

It can be, but I submit not near as traumatic as

7

1

winding up in a penal institution on the say-so of one man whan

2

you have asked for a jury trial, and on the basis of a prepcnde*

3

ance of evidence.
Q

4

I think that is so much more traumatic.

In your brief you almost seem to be asking for

5

what Mr. Justice Harlan has just suggested.

You say since his

8

case is a criminal case in any realistic sense of the term.

7

you add all these incidents of the other world, that is, of the

8

adult world, aren't you liable to wind up having all juveniles

9

tried — I am not talking about you, personally, Mr. Line.

If

If this process continues, aren't we, indeed, well on

SO
1!

the way toward abolishing the whole juvenile court concept and

12

system?
A

13

That is the other side of the coin.

The argument

14

to that effect is made earnestly, but I don't believe realistics 11

15

Mr. Chief Justice.

16

throughout this country are disposed of on pleas of guilty.

Ninety percent or more of criminal cases

Juvenile cases, the argument is made in the amicus curiae brief,

17

13

one reason that this Court shouldn't grant a jury trial is be­

19

cause it has been considered so invaluable it has never been

20

demanded.
I think reference is mad© to Denver where there were

21

22
23
24
25

only a very few requests made over a period of years.
I
On the other side of the coin, they say, on the other
hand, if you do make it available nationwide, than if. will be
in such demand that the system will break down.

Vie won’t bs

We won't be able to do this and we won't

be able to do that.
Q

I suppose we can take judicial notice, although

4

it is also in the record hare,, apparently, of the situation in

5

the District of Columbia, for example.

6

far backed up they are because they have jury trials.

7

A

That is true.

You are aware of how

Again, surely the availability of

8

a jury trial cannot depend upon the administrative convenience

9

of a court.

10

Q

What happens to the juvenile concept if we grant

11

belli to the juvenile when he is 13 or 14 years old and it takes

12

five or six years to get him to trial?

13

trying him then?

14

A

Is there any point in

Mr. Chief Justice, you have run a ringer in on

15

me on bail because that is not an issue that I have addressed

16

myself to and that is net presented by this case.

17

Q

It is part of the whole problem, though, isn’t it ?

18

A

It is part of the whole problem, but then, right

19

there, I think you get into a whole new issue.

It is probably

20

that people are acutely aware of it now because I read in the

21

paper after I got here about the juvenile crime involving drop­

ZZ

ping a rock off an overpass where he had been out on bail.

23

that becomes fresh in a person's mind.

}

24

25

So

But again, bail is something that shouldn't, perhaps,
be just automatic.

Certainly society can protect itself from

3

1

people who are psychiatrically disturbed if they think there is

2

going to be a high risk of danger to society»

3

be able to take care of that»

4

in that perhaps if this Court decides a juvenile is entitled to

5

a jury trial, the fact that perhaps it might be used as a later

S

decision that bail rights should be enlarged, I respectfully

7

suggest one step at a time»

The system should

The fact that there are problems

I think, are going to waive jury trial for a juvenile.

12

not going to, as his counsel, put him through this traumatic

13

experience unless you think that it is in his bast interest.

You are

I itfanfced to put DeBacker through the traumatic exper­

14
15

ience because I was satisfied, it was my judgment, that he woulc

16

be acquitted.
Q

17

First of all, I suppose a jury trial would neces­

sarily involve a public trial, wouldn't it?

18
19

A

Yes, Your Honor.

£0

Q

Which, of course, wonId run contrary to the idea,

as the Chief Justice has said, which was in the minds of those

21

who conceived the juvenile court system.

22

was that the proceedings be private.

23
24
25

Isn't that correct?

A

That is correct.

Q

But beyond that, you keep talking about guilty

sorts of things about his previous record and about his conduct

7

generally and his environment and his reputation and all those

8

things that are generally entirely inadmissible in a criminal

12

The charge was that

A

That was gone into in the dispositional stage,

Delinquency involves an act that would be vio­

lative of a criminal statute if performed by an adult.

?

A

Yes.

8

Q

Necessarily so?

9

A

Yes.

Is that true in Nebraska?

Subdivision 4, "Delinquent child shall mear

10

anycchild under the age of 18 years who has violated any law of

II

the State or any city or village ordinance."

12

Q

13

A

I see.
Section 5 is, "A child in need of special super­

14

vision shall mean a child who is under the age of 18 years and

13

is wayward, habitually truant, deports himself so as to en­

16

danger his morals or the morals of others."

17

Q

Under Nebraska law, can a child in need of

18

special supervision, as the statute defines it, be put into

19

custody in an industrial school or a special school?

20

A

I believe that he could.

21

Q

But hot as a delinquent.

22

A

But not as a delinquent.

Q

Your submission, as I understand it, is that any

23

24
25

proceeding that can or does result in involuntary custody for a
substantial period of time, with respect to any such proceeding
12

I

the Constitution requires the right to a jury trial.

2.

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

3

Q

So if you are correct in your tentative answer

4

as to the Nebraska law with respect to a child in need of

5

special supervision, a jury trial, it would follow, would also

6

be required for such a proceeding.,

7

A

Is that correct?

I think there is a difference.

A child in need

3

of special supervision seems to me to be a child who is in a

9

status.

A delinquent child is a child who, by his voluntary,

10

volitional conduct, has violated the law of the State.

II

that it would not necessarily apply to a child in need of

12

special supervision.

I think

For example, if a child is found on a doorstep and

13
14

becomes a ward of the juvenile court, that child doesn't need

13

a jury trial to determine whether or not somebody will look

16

after him.

17

Q

You have answered tentatively, and I am not hold™

13

ing you to this at all, but your impression is that in Nebraska

19

a child is determined to be one who is in need of special super»

20

|
vision, he can be sent, to an industrial school and there confined

21

against his will for a substantial period of time.

22

that is true.

23

Let's assume:

1 suppose it would follow from your argument that the

24 j Constitution requires a jury trial before he can be found to be
23 | a child in need of special supervision.
Ii
13

1

A

l think so.

I have some difficulty with this

2

concept of how you determine in advance how serious a ease is

3

going to be, as to whether the jury trial is going to be avail­

4

able.

5

this child that he is going to be confined for more than six

6

months., then he ought to have a jury trial.

But I think if it is contemplated in the process with

13

U

demand of the juvenile's counsel.

Second, I suppose then it

15

requires the judge to search his mind and determine what he is

16

going to do with the child.

There, frankly, I have difficulty.

The Prank case that referred to probation being im~

17

posable for over six months without a jury trial and then if

19

probation is violated only a sentence of six months could be

imposed.

facts of the case are.

23

Q

I don't know how a judge can determine what he is

Isn't that one of the considerations that led

24

the founders of the system of juvenile courts to eliminate the

25

jury and let, presumably, an expert in juvenile matters deal
14

1

with it?

2

A

I think that is perhaps one of the considerations

3

but certainly a juvenile court judge is no particular expert in

4

deciding whether or not DeBacker forged the check or broke into

5

a filling station.

competence of the jury.

That, I think, is still within the tradition

ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. KUHLMAN, ESQ.

MR. KUHLMAN:

10

If the Court please, first of all I

11

would like to point out that the reference to.the young lad

12

DeBacker being in the State Reformatory, that he is there under

13

a transfer statute which is not involved with deciding whether

14

or not there should be a jury in juvenile cases.

15

transfer statute where the young man is transferred after a

16

hearing at Kearney, and I maintain that the method to attack

17

this is to bring a habeas corpus at the penal complex to decide

!8

whether this transfer statute is unconstitutional.

This is a

This is a separata matter that should be determined.

19
20

The only thing here is whether or not the trial of the young

21

man in County Court or in the juvenile court need be with a

jury.

reformatory doesn’t have anything to do with this jury question.

been initiated attacking that transfer, did you say?

The Nebraska Juvenile Code is oriented along

judicial lines, rather than along social welfare lines.

counsel; of the right to confrontation; the right against self™

incrimination; the right to cross-examination; the right to a
