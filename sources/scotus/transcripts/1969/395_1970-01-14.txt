ORAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES van R. SPRINGER,

7

OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON
BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SPRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10

the Court: The question in this case is the meaning of the

11

standard clause in the Federal Government construction con­

12

tracts that provides the pertinent part of this clause.

13
14

“The contractor (the construction contractor) shall
be responsible for all damages to persons or property that
+ •

IS

occur as a result of his faults or negligence in connection

16

with the prosecution of the work."

17

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has up­

18

held the dismissal for the Government's complaint under this

19

clause, holding that this responsibility clause leaves the

20

United States solely liable for any injuries that arise from

21

concurrent negligence on the part of both the United States anc

22

the contractor.

23

In other words, the Fifth Circuit has read this

24

clause as relieving the contractor of any obligation to in­

25

demnify the United States, unless the contractor's negligence
2

1

2

4

is the sole and exclusive cause of injury»

Q

Well, even then, the clause doesn’t say any­

thing about indemnifying anybody; does it?
A

Well, the Fifth Circuit did treat it as «— in

5

general as an indemnity clause, saying it would operate as an

B

indemnity clause if, and only if the contractor was the sole

7

cause of the injury.

8

"responsible,88 and doesn't use the word 88indemnify,88 though I

9
10

It is true that the clause does say

will pursue that point a bit further on,
As X say, we submit that this was wrong and that the

11

responsibility clause must be read as shifting to the contrac­

12

tor as its words say, and specifically, under the facts in this

case, the full responsibility to pay all of the damages caused
fey its negligence, regardless of the fact that the United States
may also have been negligent.
Certainly, it was improper by the courts below to
dispose of'this case on the pleading, without a trial in which
the various pertinent facts relating to the contract, the
relationship between the parties and the facts of the accident
itself, could he explored.
The basic fasts are as follows;

The Seskinger

Company had a fixed price construction contract with the Navy
Department in an amount of, roughly, $650,000 for the construc­
tion of outside steam pipes at the Parris Island Marina Depot
in South Carolina,

3

Ernest Branham was an employee of Seckinger, who was

1
2

a welder and steamfitter.

3

was working on a steam transmission pipe that was being in­

4

stalled above-ground across one of the streets at the base*

5

at a height of about 16 feet above the street»

On the day of the accident Branham

6

A day or two before, this stretch of pipe crossing

7

the street had been put in place on its supports by a crane.

8

But on the day of the accident, Branham and another worker were

9

making certain adjustments in the positioning of the pipe in

10

preparation for welding to the pieces of pipe on either side

It

of the street to which it was.to be connected»
Branham was working, shortly before the accident on

12

13

one side of the street and another Rian was working the other

14

side.

15

©f course, an employee of Seckinger5s, noticed that the man on

16

the other side was having some difficulty -and directed Branham,

17

the employee, to go over andhelp him.

18

The construction foreman in charge of the job, who wase

In order to get there Branham did not climb down to

19

the street and walk across the street, but instead, walked

20

across the pipe itself, which is about 20 inches in diameter.

21

And as he came near to the place where the other man was work­

22

ing he bumped into an uninsulated power line which was running,

23

which was strung along poles in the normal way, running paralie 1

24

with the street at the side of the -—

25

Q

By whom had that power-line been strung?

4

A

i

That, was a Government-owned power line which

2

was one of the regular lines that provided power to the base.

3

I believe it was undisputed in that trial that this power

4

system covered about a third of the whole base.
The wire was about four or five feet above -the top

3

8

of the pipe and, as I say, whan Branham got to the other side .

7

where he was going, he bumped into the pipe and the shock
J

8

knocked him off the pipe and he fell to the street, which was

9

16 or 17 feet below.

10
1!

And he was, of course, seriously in­

jured.
Branham collected Workmen9s Compensation fro®

12

Seckinger under state law and also, being unable to collect

13

anything more from his employer, he sued the United States

54

under the Federal Tort Claims Act in the District Cotirt for

15

the Eastern District of South Carolina.

16

After trial, that court found that the accident had

17

been caused by negligence on the part of the Government and

18

awarded Branham damages in the amount of $45,090.

19

cally the court, in that case, found that the United States

20

had bean negligent in two respects, one or the other of which

21

it found had caused the accident.

22

Specifi­

First it found that'the Government's eonstruction

23

inspector, who was in general supervision of the job, was

24

negligent in failing to have the power line deenergised before

23

Branham was sent by the foreman to work near it.

5

j

1

And secondly, the court found that the same inspec­

2

tor was negligent in failing to warn Branham of the danger

3

of the wire.

4

The United States in that action in South Carolina,

5

filed a third party complaint against Seckinger in which it

6

sought indemnity under the responsifoi 11 fcy clause referred to,

7

saying that any injury to Branham was' caused by Seckinger, the

8

contractor’s own negligence, and therefore the. United States

9

should not bear the damages.
i

The South Carolina District Court dismissed that

10

11

third party complaint without prejudice on the theory that

12

trying it in that case would unduly complicate the proceedings

13

there»

14

did bring, a separate action of this case, against Seckinger.

15

It was unable to sue Seckinger in connection with this case

16

in South Carolina, so the case comes here from the Southern

17

District of Georgia, through the Fifth Circuit.

18

So, accordingly, the United States had to bring, and

The Government’s complaint in the indemnity suit,

19

like the third party complaint that had teen dismissed, alleged

20

that Branham’s injuries was caused by the negligence of

21

Seckinger employees.

22

the South Carolina District Court, which had held the Go%yern-

23

ment liable,-the complaint alleged as follows?

24
25

In particular, tramping the findings of

As to the failure to deenergize the power line the
complaint alleged that Seckinger, the contractor, was
6

1

responsible for requesting that the power be turned off before

2

it sent for him to work near 'the wires?; or else that Seckinger

3

should have either put. some insulation on the wires,, or re­

4

quested the Government to do so»

5

And as to the second element ©f negligence , the

6

South Carolina District Court had found, the complaint alleged

1

that Seckinger should not have directed Branham to work near

8

the wires and should have prevented him from proceeding in a

9

dangerous manner.,

10

Q

How much ©f a rating did Branham get?

11

A

$45,000»

12

Q

Therefore, this complaint alleged that

13

Seckinger3s negligence was the cause of the injuries to Branhan

14

-and the contractual responsibility clause made Seckinger sole

13

liable for them? and thereeore, Seckinger should indemnify

16

•the United States for the damages that it paid»

17

The Government was prepared to prove 'these allega­

18

tions, of course, at a trial, though it never had a chance to.

19

It was prepared to prove not only that Seckinger was negligent

20

and that negligence caused the accident, but also that the

21

circumstances were such that Seckinger was primarily negligent

22

and the Government only secondarily so»

23

If, as the South Carolina Court has held the Govern­

24

ment should have turned the power off, the relationship between

25

the parties was such that the Government could rely on

7

:

1

Seckinger, the contractor , to inform him when it was necessary

2

to turn the power off.

3

show that Seckinger had a full-time foreman on the job at the

4

time of the accident, as the contract required; whereas, the

5

Government’s inspector, who was charged only with inspection

S

of the performance under the contract, was concerned not only

7

with this job, but with a number of other jobs going on at the

S

same time and, in fact, was not present at the site of this

9

job when the accident occurred, but was somewhere else, super­

10

vising another job.
As to the Government8s breach of its duty to warn

11
12

13
14
15
16

Branham, the South Carolina District Court has found, the
Government would further have relied, had it bean able to have
a trial on its indemnity clause, on the specific instructions
that were given to Seckinger in the contract to assure safety

In this regard the Government would

Yes.

The Court, of Appeals said it wouldn’t ever cover

a case where the Government was negligent?

Yes? that®s correct»

5

A

That is ~

6

Q

Welly it has no scope at ally then?

7

A

Yes y because the Government cannot be liable

8

under the Tort. Claims Act, unless it or one of its agents is

9

negligent and, in fact, there is no authority under that act

10

for the Government even to settle a case, unless the person who

H

authorises the settlement and believes that the Government liras

12

negligent and 1 suppose if a non-negligent Government settled

13

a case and then sued for indemnity under the interpretation

M

the Fifth Circuit has given to this clause, the person sued

13

could then say the settlement was improper because the Govern™

16

rnent had no authority to settle the case.

Mr. Springer, is this a standard clause?

In fact, these clauses are written until,

formulating these provisions since the industry is consulted.

Yota could say, with a proviso at the end tha

this clause means what it says, even if the Government itself
is negligent.

But, we would submit, that that isn’t necessary.

matter, seme person decreeing that it would be to have it that

that there are 200 cases pending —

Oh, 1 am sure there would foe many thousands,

since it covers all fixed-price construction contracts that the
Government, or virtually all that the Government, whether the
Defense Department or the rest of the Government»

Q

Yon say there are some 200 cases pending and

awaiting a decision of this case?
A

Well, they are in the District Courts,

Q

Yes ,

In fact, this is the only, so far as I am aware,

the only case that has gotten to the Court ©f Appeals»

And prior to the decision in this case, what had

been the fate of this clause in cases such as this arising in
the District Courts,

Do you say this clause has been in Govern

I should think there would* be a

great deal of law one- way or the other.

A

I have to say that this clause has not, at

least until the 60 Bs been used by the Government, generally
speaking, as an indemnity clause»

I think that may seem

strange*, but I think probably the simplest explanation for
that is that it was not until relatively recent years that
employees who were barred from pursuing their employers under

7

Government contracts, thought up the notion of suing the

8

Government under the theory that the Government was negligent

9

and was a handy third party.

The Federal Court Claims Act goes back to the

12

Yes.

Did I understand you to suggest that this

14

problem might be eliminated by simply putting it after the

That certainly could be done, Mr» Justice

But that could be done in any contract.
Q

We would still have to construe what it meant,

wouldn’t we?
A

Well, I think you would say in other language,

22

you would say, as I would say in argument that you could put

23

the various different means, forming some words in saying what j-

24
25

Q

You underestimate the abilities of our pro­

fession? don’t you?'

12

1

A

Increasingly less, Mr, Justice Black»

2

The Fifth Circuit, of course, treated this clause,

3

and we think erroneously, as an insurance clause»

It thought j

4.

that the Government was basing its case on the proposition

'5

that this clause entitled the Government to indemnification

from a contractor, even if the contractor was utterly innocent

7

of any negligence.' '

complaint are that the Seckinger Company was negligent; that

Of course, that8s not the theory of our

its hegligence caused the accident, and therefore, and only

ii

therefore, the Seckinger Company is obligated to bear, as the

12

clause says, the responsibility for its negligence.

13

Q

Are you asking for construction that would

14

hold where both parties are negligent, that the Government

15

should not be held liable; are you asking -— where both parties

16

are negligent -- the question is whether both parties are

r/

negligent and if the Government is shown not to be and the

18

contractor is shown to have been the prime cause, that he

18

shall -- which are you arguing about?

20

A

Well, I think that, as X said in answer to

21

Mr. Justice White's question, if the Government is not

22

negligent, this ease couldn't arise, because the Government

23

it is not subject to liability if it, itself is not negligent.

24
25

So that we are necessarily in the situation where both the
Government and the contractor are negligent.

13

I

1

Q

2

A

3

And then what do you ask?

i

We say that, in any such case, that the meaning!

of this clause is that the contractor shall bear* full damages.

4

Q

5

A

Full damages.
Of course, now, we don't think that if that

6

proposition is rejected, that we are out of court in this

1

case.

3

say, that at least, there shall be some allocation of liability

9

between the contractor and the Government.

10

It
12

We think it's perhaps a less-sweeping rule, you could

And, of course,

that's commonplace, at least where there is disparate
responsibility in. the common law itself.
Q

I guess if that were adopted, the easiest way

13

to work it out of court would be to say that each of you

14

are equally liable, without having to go through weeks of

!5

evidence to find out which was- the most liable; which was the

16

most negligent.

!

A

That would be a possible rule.

Of course.,

there is a growing body of authority on comparative negligence
where the finder of facts does, in fact, allocate the respon­
sibility and of course, there is the more traditional rule
that where one party is primarily negligent and the other is
only secondarily so, which is clearly on the facts of this
case, the theory of the Government's point thcifc —
Q

The easiest way might be for the Government to

get a better contract.

14

A

That.’s certainly true# Mr, Justice Black.

Of course that could be said*, as 3: suggested„ of any contract
that if you had drafted it better you wouldn't have a lawsuit,j
You answered that
Q

The Government is going to continue in the

business of making contracts.

Have they changed it any since

this case —
A

No, it has not been changed, although there

are, in fact, I gather constantly, there are revisions of
these clauses -under consideration, and the Department of
Justice has suggested that we could, avoid these cases by more
explicit language.
Q

That may or may not be so,

Suppose the law allocates the responsibility,

the law of — where was this, South Carolina, North Carolina?
A
Q

South Carolina,
And South Carolina, 1 suppose, like every other

state that 2 know anything about, makes this employer liable,
whether or not he is negligent, to the employee under some form
of workmen's compensation„

I assume that's bean paid and that

liability has been discharged by the employer in this case,*
is that right?
A

Yes, although I think it would be clear that if

the United States ware otherwise entitled to gome kind of
indemnity, you could not set up the South Carolina Workman8s
Compensation statute as any kind of a defense to his liability

15

to the United States, particularly under contract with the
Government, and perhaps even as a -matter of —
Q

That would be a matter of the state law, the

common law, then?
A

Yes.

Q

Of course, you don't win this lav/suit if you

win here, do you?
A

No, certainly, but we have to prove negligence.

Q

Yes.

A

And we have to prove compensation, end perhaps,

although we think we should not have to, we might have to prove
the relative responsibility.
Q

Did I understand you to suggest that perhaps

if you succeeded here and also in proving negligence, it
doesn't necessarily meari you'd get a judgment for $45,000?
A

Well, we would say that the literal

language

of the contract clause is the contractor shall be responsible
for all damages as a result of his negligence.

But I must say,

it is our first position that that, automatically assures us
full recovery..
Q

I wasn’t sure whether you were talking about

the joint contribution or comparative negligence.
A

I am suggesting that that would be another

view that could be taken.
Q

Well, if you prevail here you are going after
16

i

1

the whole $45,000?

2

A

Yes, first on the theory that the contract

3

gives it to us automatically.

4

common law indemnity theory that insofar as the United States

3

has a duty to this man it was justified in relying upon the

'5

contractor to discharge the particular duties that gave rise

7

to the United States* liability.

Secondly, on the traditional

Well, X suppose your basic claim o£ negligence

against the contractor is that they put the man where people

10

normally are not supposed to be and must take all of the burden

of that.

Well, they did 'that, and of course, the con­

13

tractor himself says, in one of the clauses we have set forth

14

in our appendix, "that the contractor shall give his personal

The consequenceof the Fifth Circuit's view of it is that the

And it also uses the word

"indemnify."

So, the definition ©f responsible is much more

Yours hinges around those two words?

Yes, sir; yes, sir.

I'm amased that

A

To our side .

The Government cites Porello

6

when they try to get into the Ryan Doctrine and leave the

7

narrow question of 'the interpretation of the word and go to

e

implied warranty, which also is an issue in this case.

9

Porello has a similar clause, although it was much longer.

And

to

And beyond 'these two cases, neither side has been able to come

11

up with much.
Now, in that context, remember this clause was born

12
13

in its present form in 1938 at a time when indemnity by the

14

United States would have been impossible because there was no

15

Right.

indemnity to the United States.

You mean they could not have been held liable,
Exactly.

So, hot'/, in 1954 when this contract

20

was drawn, can it get added meaning to cover a situation which

21

was not in effect when the present wording of the con-tract was

22

born.

23

Q

Dont we take it from the time it was born,

24

But it was put in with that abundance in 1938

15

when indemnity wasn't possible.

abundance of precaution you would certainly use the word

Now# the title to this clause is misleading.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

6
7

Mr. Kennedy, you may

MR. KENNEDY:

Thank you, sir.

We left off when we

8

were taking a close look at the clause and we were making the

9

point that it had a title which does not say anything about

10

indemnification and has a first sentence which lacks any

11

words of indemnification and, we submit, falls short of being

12

a real indemnification clause.

13

The scope of the paragraph is not indemnity.

The

14

intention of the paragraph is not indemnity and we feel that

15

this clause is not sufficient to require the contractor to

16

pay back what the government has lost as a result of its

17

IS

negligence.
Q

Do you make that argument against the propo­

19

sition that you are or are not liable for any part of the fault

21

did? which way?

10

I think the latter would be closer.

included an indemnity clause,, so that the Exchequer would not

be out the entire $45,000,

We are &n

no position to document the number; we are in no position to
document the amount that is at stake, but certainly, if con­
tractors are required to go onto a Government installation and
to indemnify the Government for its negligence there's going
to be a much higher bill for Government contracts.

The Govern­

ment is urging the position that although their negligence was
$45,000 worth and was sufficient to sustain the verdict of
$45,000, we, the contractor, have to pay them back.

This is a

long and hard burden for a contractor to assume and I don't

situation

25

in this case —
32

!

!

Q

That wasn't my question, Mr. Springer.

2

haven't submitted it, as I understand it.

3

have got is the —• as 1 asked you earlier — what is the

4

meaning of the clause in the contract.

5

A

You

The only issue we

1 think, to answer strictly technically and

6

accurately, we have, I think, preserved the Ryan theory but we

7

do not primarily rely on it because 1 think that anything that.

8

Ryan would give us we say we have explicitly in &e clause.

9

And the Ryan line of cases does, in some sens®, set a back­

10

ground for our statement of what we say this clause means is

n

not extrordinary, because at least in the Ryan — whatever

12

area Ryan covers -the Government contractors have been given by

13

implication, what we say here we are entitled to by a natural

14

reading of -the clause.
Mr. Kennedy has referred to the absence of record in

15
16

this case.

Obviously the reason there isn't a record is be­

17

cause we haven't had a chance to make one.

18

that l9ve made about the facts of the accident are taken from

19

the findings made by Judge Timmerman in the earlier case in

20

the Eastern District of South Carolina and we have lodged,

21

in connection

22

believe everything X8ve said, even what I've said about what

23

we would prove, which, of course, is really just me talking at

24

this point, since we haven't had a chance to make a recordon

25

that.

The statements

with this case, the record of that case and I

Everything in that is at least consistent, and I believe,
33

1

supported by testimony in. the transcript of the earlier trial.

2

As I -understand Mr, Kennedy's argument it's pri­

3

marily that this clause should not he considered as speaking

4

to the matter o£ indemnity at all.

5

he departs from the view that the Fifth Circuit itself took.

6

And I think it*s. plain the Fifth Circuit regarded this as

7

some kind of indemnity clause.

8

an indemnity clause which could stand up to this kind of case

9

where the Government was negligent or also negligent.

Of course, in that respect

It simply held that it wasn't

But I

10

think the Fifth Circuit agrees with us at least to the extent

11

of saying, "This is where we look in this contract if we want

12

to know what kind of indemnity there is."
As to the historical origins of this clause, I

13
14

think it is, as I understand, the situation that prevailed

15

prior to the Tofct Claims Act is not strictly accurate to say

16

that the Government was never subjected to Tort liability.

17

believe what normally happened was that Congress would passs

18

a private bill or at least this happened in a number of cases,

19

which in effect, amounted to an “ad hoc" Tort Claims Act,

20

giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction to adjudicate whether

21

or not the Government should be liable.

I

So, that kind of

"

22

Situation could wall have given rise to a situation where the j

23

Government had beenhela liable and want to look somewhere for j

24

indemnity.

25

Q

Well, that would be an extreme claim under this

language? wouldn81 it?

Also, it's true that these clauses are being, as I

said earlier, reconsidered, and to some extent, reworded from

time to time.
