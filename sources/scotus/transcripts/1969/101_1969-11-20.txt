ORAL ARGUMENT BY GORDON P. MAC DOUGALL, ESQ.

. ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. MAC DOUGALL;

MR. Chief Justice and may it please

50

the Court, I appear for the Appellants and my argument time is

15

lading shared by Counsel for the United States and the Interstate

12

Commerce Commission, because the Government has aligned itself

13

in this case on the Appellant8s side.

14

These are two direct appeals from two cases heard

15

together by a Three-Judge District Court for the Northern

IS

District of Illinois.

17

action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in allowing to be

13

discontinued a portion of one passenger and all of another

19

passenger train.

20

These two cases were suits to review the

The press of this continuance involved the Chicago to

21

Evansville segments of the Georgian Train which operates from
i
s

22

Chicago to Atlanta? and a complete discontinuance with the

23

Hummingbird Train which operates from Cincinnati to New Orleans.

24

The interconnection is at Nashville.

25

Appellants had a substantial interest in this service
-

3
1

1

since these are the only trains — the only daily trains from

2

Chicago to Terre Haute, Vincennes, Evansville, Chattanooga,

3

Mobile and now the only daily service from Chicago to Nashville

4

and Montgomery, Alabama.,

5

The Court Below dismissed both of the actions for

6

lack of jurisdiction and the Court said that Congress intended

7

to deny judicial review to the public because when the carrier

3

prevails at -the ICC the order is one discontinued investigation

0

On the other hand, if the railroad loses at the l.C.C,

10

the order is one requiring a continued train operation and the

i?

railroad can go to court.

12

And we think this is unfair and the reason to think

13

it’s legally unfair is that Congress never intended the unfair

14

result and there is nothing in the legislative history to

15

suggest that the public can’t go to court, but the railroads

16

can go to court,

17

Q

What you mean is that you think it’s illegal

!8

A

Well, the question --

19

Q

And we- get into this same question about

20

unfairness —
A

21

I just thought I'd mention the word "unfair*

22

ness” since it's com® up today.

23

sions which we rely on did use the word "unfair," and said that

24

Congress could not be presumed to have intended such an unfair

25

result,

representing all of the State Commissions for the 50 States,

8

the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
The Appellees are the Chicago and East Illinois

&
10

Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.
The sole issue before the Court, in our judgment,

11

IZ

is whether Congress did intend to deny judicial review to the

!3

public, while granting such judicial review to the railroads.

14

There is no question of.standing involved.

15
16

17
18
19
20
21

22
23

24
25

Courts have expressly passed upon the issue.

Eight District
Two earlier

decisions in 1965 held there was no judicial review for the
public.

And all of the decisions since then have held to the

opposite, that there is judicial review.
And one of these other decisions was rendered by a
Three-Judge Court for the same Northern District of Illinois
after the judgments below were entered.
How, the statute we have here is Section 13-AfX) of
the Interstate Commerce Act, which became law in 1958.

And

contrary to the opinion below, there is nothing in the language
or the legislative history of 13-A(1) to suggest that Congress
5
i

1

intended to deny judicial review.
The general framework of the Interstate Commerce

2
3

Act is that decisions of the Commission are Subject to judicial

4

review.

5

an investigation at the Commission.

6

virtually all of their rate cases and thosedecisions have been

7

subject to review? reviewed by this Court ever since the

8

Rochester decision in 1939 and the Administrative Procedure

9

Act in 1945.

10

There is nothing unusual about an order discontinuing ]
This i.3 what they do in

The Commission institutes an investigation of a

11

freight rate and finds it lawfult the order is one discontinued

investigation.

Exactly the one which Appellants were denied

Now, the lower court based --primarily based its
opinion on the wording of the statute.

And they said that

where the railroad files a notice and elects to supercede state
jurisdiction the X.C.C. has authority in that 30-day notice
period to either institute investigation or not.

If it doesn't

institute an investigation the Lower Court held that the trainoff becomes effective pursuant tothe statute.
Q

And is tha.t — do you concede that? that if

i

no investigation is initiated by the Commission within the
period then do you concede that that’s the end of it?
A

No, I don't think so.

that the ferry was unwarranted.

but that- they were just going to have scows across the harbor»

was passed, had held

And that was upset in court
■y

S

So, Congress passed 13aClK

The carrier then

7

invoked 13a CD and the Commission declined to institute an

8

investigation and inits notice, said one of the reasons was

9

the prior report.

10

We have already investigated this.

And that's the State of New Jersey case and I don't

11

think that the courts are precluded from judicial review in this

12

30-day period.

13

could have a bad-enough case, corruption at idle Commission,

14

something like that, possibly you>would get judicial review,

15
16

17

It depends on the use of discretion.

If you

Q

But your argument there, or am I mistaken in
\
thinking that your argument in no way depends upon that issue?
A

That's right.

This was given great weight

18

h* the Court Below.

19

based on the State of New Jersey, and said, well, since that

20
21

They used this nonreviewability concept

since a train would come off at -the end of 30 days without —
Q

That's the Appellant's argument, but your

22

argument in no way depends — you could concede, as I understand

23

your argument at least, that the authority of the Commission to

24

hold a hearing and then discontinuance of the servies is n-*u~

25

reviewable and still may be basic to the argument you are now
8

1

making*

2

Yes, because —

3

Q

Which is the mutuality argument*

4

A

Well, I point out that Section 1336(a) of

5

Title 28 says that you can go to court with any order of the

6

Interstate Commerce Commission.

7

order discontinuing an investigation is such an order.

8
9

10
1?

The question is whether an

Now, where the Commission doesn't investigate the
case there is no order? it's a notice*

There is no such thing

as an order issued*
And that really is our case in a nutshell.

The

12

second reason given by the Court Below is that if you allow

13

judicial review why, you will have delays and it was a Cong™

14

ressional purpose to stop the delays that were occurring at

15

the State Commission level.

16

And Congress set up a dual system.

Most train-&5fs today are before the State Commis­

17

sions , not the XoC.Co

18

statute? not self— a carrier has to file notice and that act

19

supercedes the state jurisdiction*

20
21

22

Section 13a(1) is not self-executing

WE have a situation where this statute has been set
up and Congress answered the delay problem by imposing a 12month limitation upon the Interstate Commerce Commission. That’s

23

where they answer to the delay — you have judicial review in

24

State Commissions and there is no reason why you can’t have

25

judicial review in I.C.C. decisions.

The Louisville and Nashville In our brief, suggests

!

that if you have judicial review you are going to have injunc­
tions a
Our answer to that is that1 s all right;, but that
issue is not before this Court, because the Louisville-Nashvilie
stopped the train at Birmingham and the application for a stay
was denied, so the question of injunctions or stays pendente
11te are not before the Court now.
The sole issue is whether there is ultimate judicial
review and this is an important case to Chicago and to the
Southern States involved and to ail regulatory commissions.
And we ask that the judges below be reversed.

Mr.Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF U. S. AND Z.C.C.
IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANTS
MR, SHAPIRO;

Appellant's/obtained Jtidi^lal review of the Commission's decisio
permitting discontinuance of the trains involved in this case.
We do so for two legal reasons;

more than just discontinue the investigation? it makes a sub­

stantive determination and that substantive determination has a ,

substantial impact on the communities affected and because of

12

that impact it amounts to a reviewable order*

13
14

I talc© it that you think, then, that as soon as
■
they start an investigation 'the standards of the Act take over

and that it has to be consistent withthe public interest for

• •

A

'

only in tie event that they want to order the trains to be
continued *

i
A

Well, in determining whether there should!»©

23

an investigation, of course, they have to considerthe stand­

24

ards of the Act,

25

But there8s more to it,
1

When an agency is going to decide whether or not
IS

?

to investigate something, not only is it considering the sub­

a

stantive standards involved, but also it has to take into

3

account other considerationss resources, the situation — the

4

importance of the termination to the area affected and so on.

5

Q

Well, tell me this, Mr. Shapiro: I gather

6

that Congress enacted this law, as I recall it, out of some

7

impatience with the delays and — in getting trains discontinued,

8

didn’t they?

9

A

10

Q

Thatis correct.
Where properly railroads should be allowed to

11

discontinue jervica was alx tied up with the state and the

12

commission hearings and everything else and sometimes years

13

went on before they succeeded? is that it?

U

A

That is the purpose of the statute

15

Q

And certainly that’s action contemplated some

15
17
18
19

kind of summary procedure? didn't it?
A

It contemplated an expedited procedure? not

necessarily a summary procedure.
Q

That's why they ~

Well, isn't it summary to the extent that the

20

Commission decides not to investigate, as I understand it, what

21

washheld in the-New Jersey case, is silent? namely: that is

22

not judicial review.

23

the railroad discontinues its service.

)

24
23

A

Well, that ends the whole business and

And the reason it does, Your Honor, is

because under the criteria governing judicial review, in the
16

1

Administrative Procedure Act, the decision of whether toopen

2

an investigation or not is committed fcothe agency's discretion

3

and hence is not reviewable.
Once ife has taken agency action it has a substantial!

4

I

5

impact on people who are protesting that action end were

6

affected by it.
Q

7

And then« of course , the other thing is that

8

you have got only four months to set when you do investigate?

9

don-t you?

i
A

10

it
12
13

but its suspension ©f the railroad’s discontinuance is only
four months.

Q

18

j

In other words,, another one of those things

that isn’t, fair? is that it?
A

IS

17

And the Commission endeavors to wind these pro­

ceedings up rapidly.

14

IS

The Commission can take more than four months

It boils down in a sense* to a fairness

question.
I’d say only that on the law* what you’ve got here
is a declaratory order, in effect, of the kind that was used in

19

20
21

22
23
24

the Frozen Food Express ease.

And there rhe Court held that an

■
order that si&ply had the.affect of declaring what certain
rights — Commission order declaring certain rights under the

i

Agricultural Exemption to the law, was said to be reviewable.
■
Now, that order, I might say, in the Frozen Food
Express case, contained the same language that we have in this

;

ease 0
It makes --the order — the Commission makes certain

3

findings and incorporates those findings into its order by

reference and it said "The investigation is to be discontinued,1

The impact of that evaluation order would be felt when

And the real issue is

expedition in the review process, not denying review altogether
■ Now, the only other two grounds that I rely upon

13
14

to deny a review are first, that there is some difference in

15

the substantive standard, between 13a CD which governs inter­

16

state trains, and 13a(2) which governs intrastate trains.

But the answer to that is that this Court has said
in Southern Railway Company against North Carolina that the sub- ■
stantive standards are the same.

And infact, if we look at

them, although there are sane slight wording differences, it
amounts to the same tiling.

are differant because the standards for review are different,

I think the best analogy ona can give is the

situation in which the General Counsel of the; NLRB issues a

Q

Now, what happens, Mr, HosXand, if the hear­

ing proceeds and the decision is not to stop? not to stop»

A

It is, indeed, Your Hones; because the Inter­

state Commerce Commission can prevent the discontinuance of an
22

1

interstate train only on the finding by the Commission that a

2

public need exists for the train and that it is not an undue

3

burden on interstate or foreign commerce for the train to be

4

discontinued*
Now, this is the only order that can foe.issued in an

The discontinuance, although they

the Commission labels it an order, it is

not, in fact, am order because the railroads are simply taking
advantage of srhat the statute grants them: their right to dis­

The notice ©r order as the Commission calls it, is
simply a means of notifying the people who participated in the
proceeding as to what the Commission has done with the case*
If they can'fc make a specific statutory findings in both of
them, than there is no basis under which the railroad can be
required to keep the trains for a maximum period of one year*
Inthat regard there is a big difference betwee*

the

provisions of Section 13aCD and Section 13a(2) of the Inter­
state Commerce Act.

A railroad which wants to take off an

intrastate passenger train must first proceed before the state
regulatory body.

If that state does nothing within 120 days

or acts unfavorably within that period they then have the right j

By contrasty the parties other than the Commission

The carriers have nothing to prove in a 13a(1)

proceeding. They can take off an interstate train for any
reason they choose,' so long as they publish the required notice.,

As this Court has held in the Atlantic Coastline

19

case — Z.C.C. versus Atlantic Coastline, that a Commission ©rdte r

20

is reviewable if it determines rights or obligations from which

21
22
23
24
25

legal consequences may flow»
I respectfully submit that there are no legal rights
i:n the interest of the Appellants in this case t© which they
are entitled to judicial review and I think that this Court has
answered that question in the Hew Jersey case because if the
26

1

Appellants have a right in anSection 13a proceeding , that right,

2

should certainly survive the decision of the Interstate

3

Commerce Commission, whether it would or would not investigate

4

a train-off case.
In'those instances where the Commission refuses to

5
6

investigate, -the interested communities: the State of New

7

Jersey and its Bublie Service Commission and the County of

8

Bergen and all others, certainly was as great as it is when the

9

Commission sets a case down for hearing.
But this Court has held that there is no judicial

10
11

review where the Commission does not investigate.

12

certainly there is nothing in the manner inwhich Congress

13

drafted 13a(1) that suggests any fragmentising of the question

14

of judicial review depending ©l whether the ICC decides to

13

investigat or whether it doesn’t.
i\nd a corollary to that point, 1 believe, is the

16
17
18

19
20
21
22

23

fact that the argument of the Government in this case is that
the ICC decides whether judicial review is available.

Now,

certainly Congress never intended that when they enacted

Section 13a(IK

But the Government says: ‘’If the Commission

does not investigate then it is not subject to judicial re­
view.

However, if the Commission does investigate it is sub­

ject tojudieial review."
Now, the question of whether an investigation was

24
25

Now,

held or

tot, was dependent,*-' according,to the Government* solely

27

'i

on the question of whether a substantial question exists and so

2

by the simple expedient of the Commission deciding whether or

3

not a substantial question exists, judicial review is or is; not

4

had«

5

But it is not, certainly in the statute nor in the

6

intention of Congress when it enacted Section 13a(1) that any

?

such distinction could ever be drawn.
I might say? Your Honors, that another point which

8
9

bears very directly

on this issue, and that is on the question

of judicial review, are the circumstances underlying enactment
n

of Section 13a (!).
In 1958 the railroads were indire financial condi­

12
13
14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
23

tion; they were losing at the rate ©f about $700 million a year
on

their passenger train operations alone.

Theretofore, the

railroads were relegated to the piecemeal approach of going to
eachof the various states through which the interstate ksr^in
operates and to seek their authority to discontinue a train.
And frequently that authority was denied, or in massy cases,
unduly delayed and as a consequence, Congress was highly con­
cerned that the extensive delays that were being experienced,
and the costly delays in burdens on the railroads to operate
unneeded and costly passenger trains.
This was the very purpose that Congress entered the
field and when it did,

it gave the carriers the right, to

completely bypass any state regulatory proceeding by the

28

1

expedient of filing a notice of 30 days.;- that would enable them

2

to discontinue the train and thus postpone for another four

3

months by the Institution of an investigation„

4

The Government and the Appellants would have this

5

Court believe that the concept of judicial review is not in-

6

compatible with the intent of Congress to dispose of these

7

eases as promptly as possible»

8
9

Congress has set a maximum period of five months
under which a train has to ba operated,,

Unless the Commission

10

issues an order, based on the two statutory standards previously

II

mentioned, requiring continued operation for one more year»

12

But the point, I think is established by the circum-j
.

13

stances in Number 102, the L&N Trains that are involved»

The

so-called Hummingbird trains between Cincinnati and New Orleans!
14
15
16
17

The day before the discontinuance was to take effect
the Appellants filed suit in the Federal Court in'Chicago and
!
received a temporary restraining order'/ which restraining order

18

'
remained in effect for a period ©f nine months after the date

19

that the L&N filed its notice to discontinue the trains.

20
21

Congress sat the period at five months as a maximum

j

_and yet here the L&N was operating a train that was losing

22

money at the rate of a million dollars a year for an additionalj

23

period of time without any protection bond and I daresay that

24-

if tliiSi Court had granted a stay of the District Court's order

2.5

then it would still be operating.

25

We would be losing at the

■

i

1

rate of a million and half dollars -- we would have lost at

2

least a million and a half dollars by now and in continuing to

3

operate until further order of the Court.
.

5

I certainly don't think that there is any consistency'
■
between th© intention of Congress in enacting and putting on

s

si maximum five months statutory suspension period and the

7

concept of judicial review where railroads have‘frequently faced

3

with temporary restraining orders, and where bonds are not.

9

given for the adequate protection of any damages that might be

4

10

given.
I might want to say one more thingg Your Honors,

11
12

withrespect to the Los Angeles case,

As this Court held in that

13

proceedings that there are so-called orders of the Interstate
!

U

Commerce .Commission which are not subject to judicial review.

IS

With respect to the discontinuance of a proceeding

16

under 13a(1} the Commission does characterise its discontinuance•

17

as an order.

18

should characterise it as an order and in fact, it is nothing

19

more than a notice to the parties and if anything, a house­

20

keeping order.

2!

anything.in this case.

There is nothing in the statute that says they

It is not an order ordering 'anybody to do

22

And under those circumstances, we respectfully sub­

23

mit that the decision ©£ Los Angeles is, in effect, after this

24

25

point.

And what the Commission has simply done in issuing its

so-called order of notice of discontinuance is merely the
30

1

statement of the results of its investigation.
Thank you, Your Honors

12

Thank you, Mr. Hoelend

I’d like to just mention one or

ter© things; the first is that where the C

does enter

upon an investigation during' the 30-days notice period, and
where it does issue an order requiring

continued operation of

the train, after that point the discontinuance of the trains
does not become operative pursuant to the statute.

It becomes

operative pursuant to the expiration of the Commission order?
an order in which the Commission determines it will not renew

13
14
15

it
►x

So, if there is a Commissionapproval or disapproval,

©f the train-off case, once they enter upon an investigation.
16
Mow, it’s true that in the 30-day notice period if
1?
they decide not to investigate

the discontinuance, would take

18
19

place pursuant to the statute.
The case is not before us today.

20
21

We are not re­

arguing Idie State of Mew Jersey or finding out what modifica...
j

tion of it should be made.

The case we have here today is that

22
the Commission idid institute an investigation and moreover,
23
they held hearings and the statute requires a hearing.

Section

24
13a Cly

? requires evidence and requires

25
31

i

findings under Section 14(1) of the Interstate Coireaerce Act

2

once the Commission enters an investigation it has to make

3

findings and a report»

4

And the last thing x*d like to say is that in order

5

simply discontinuing an investigation is common at the Commis­

6

sion; common.

It hasn't come to this Court, in such a precise

gation, but this is — does happen behind the scenes in all of
the freight rate cases»
Q

Wouldn't you have to have that finding before

an order of discontinuance?
A
it the other ways

Tour Honor, the statute requires — putting
It says if theCommission finds that continued

operation is required it can issue an order requiring continned operation? but. the Commission has alwyas held that the
opposite applies? that once they enter an investigation? once
they hold hearings, that they have to make findings; findings
as to whether or not the trains are required by public commutem
necessity? or whether they are not»
And that decision is the Great Northern decision
recorded at 307 ICC»
And also the — as 2 said, Section 14(a) requires
findings and a report and I -think that the Administrative
