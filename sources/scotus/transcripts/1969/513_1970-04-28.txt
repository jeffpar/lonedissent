ARGUMENT OF MELVIN L. WULF, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

10

11

MR. WULF;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.

i2

The contempt conviction of an attorney is here on

13

appeal from the Louisiana Supreme Court.

14

poned pending argument on the merits, and there are some juris­

15

dictional problems.

1G

describe the facts of the conviction itself because the facts

Jurisdiction was post-

Before discussing those, I would like to

of the conviction also involve some of the jurisdictional prob­
lems .
The appellant in this case, Mr. Spencer, is an attorney t
a member of the Louisiana Bar who appeared before Judge Dixon
a District Court judge in the Louisiana Courts representing one
Mr. Hopkins in a hearing in a divorce case.

It was an unconteste 2

divorce suit and the purpose of the hearing was, according to
the Louisiana practise, to confirm default in Mr. Hopkins favor.
After testimony was given by Mr. Hopkins and a witness
2

1

on his behalf. Judge Dickson denied the divorce because the
2

9
10

11

testimony didn’t show abandonment by the spouse but showed only
that Mr. Hopkins and Mrs. Hopkins had had an argument, and that
they decided that one of them should leave.

Mrs. Hopkins was thn

one to leave.
The following day, after the denial of the divorce, the
appellant filed a motion for a new trial on behalf of his client,
Mr. Hopkins, on the ground that the decision by Judge Dixon
was erroneous in fact and in law.
Simultaneously with filing the suction for a new trial,
he also filed a to recuse Judge Dixon.

The Motion to Recuse,

•32

which he filed, is set out in the back of our brief.
13
14

Q

Did that motion contain any new matter that he

hadn't known the day before or the 'week before?

15

A

The record doesn't show, Your Honor.

16

Q

Can any inferences be drawn as to whether this was

17

some discovery overnight, or whether it was a new idea after he

18

learned that he had received an adverse decision?

ID

A

I believe that one cannot draw any inferences

20

from the record because there isn't anything in the record at

21

all to suggest when this impeachment proceeding was initiated, 11

22

it was initiated and what any of the facts surrounding that

23

petition were.

24
25

Q

So,

but we

don't even know if it is true or

false, is that correct?
3

1

A

We don't know it is true or false, Your Honor.

2

One of the reasons we don’t know whether it is true or false is

3

that the Judge who sat on the contempt proceeding itself a year

4

later wouldn’t allow any such testimony to be entered.

5

record is ambiguous as to whether any such testimony was attempt-•

6

ed to be put in by the appellant,

7

The

It is perfectly clear from the statement, of Judge

8

Williams himself, he was the judge who sat on the contempt hear­

9

ing

and this is contained in the record of the case and also

10

in the back of the jurisdictional statement —- Judge Williams in

11

opposing Mr. Spencer's application for writs of certiorari to

12

Louisiana Supreme Court, and I quote - - I

13

In his application — opposition to the application, which is

14

in the record, Judge Williams said himself that he refused to

15

admit any such evidence concerning the truth of the assertion

1G

in the Motion to Recuse.

17

18

Q

eki

sorry I don't quote.

And we don’t know if Mr. Hopkins was a lawyer or

what he was as far as the record goes.

19

A

I think Mr. Hopkins was not a lawyer,

20

Q

And we don31 know anything about Mr. Charles

21
.22
23
24
25

Anderson„ III?
A

No, sir, less about him than about Mr. Hopkins.

Q

Do we know anything — I suppose we coula take

judicial notice, although I certainly don’t have any actual
notice of how in New Orleans you get a judge removed from office

you get a judge removed front office as being unfit therefor or

for any other reason.

We don't know anything about this case,

We do know that there was then a procedure under

6

the Louisiana constitution, Article 9 of the constitution, which

provided that upon the petition of any 25 citizens of the State

in which they allege that a judge was guilty of a run of a fair­

ly long list of offences ranging from high crimes and misdemeano cs

10

to habitual drunkenness;, including incompetency, corruption, favor

itism, extortion, oppression in office and gross misconduct, fcha

citizens so alleging that the District Attorney had to initiated

Where?

Before what form?

A

The Supreme Court of Louisiana, Your Honor.

However, that statute which was in effect at toe time

17
18

Q

that this Motion to Recuse was filed was repealed not long after­
wards .
Q

Do we know, Mr. Waif, how it came about that

Judge Dixon ceased to hold office as a judge?
A

He was elevated to an appellant court in Louisi­

ana not long after this trial also. Your Honor.
Q

You are going to address yourself to whether you

are legally here at all on the question of whether there is an
5

1

tppeal, are you?

2
3

A

Yes, sir, 1 ant.

But, if I may just finish the

ecital of the facts, I will address myself to that.

4

Q

I am sorry I interrupted you.

5

A

Rhe Motion to Recuse contained the following

6

paragraphs, it is paragraph 4 and it is set out at page 8 in

7

;he appendix, the separate appendix.

8

It says the plaintiff herein, Lewis P. Hopkins, Jr., arc

9

.is chief witness in the case, Mr. Charles Anderson, III, are

10

resently engaged in the process of attempting to have Judge

II

ixon removed from office as being unfit therefor by virtue of

12

orruption, favoritism, and misfeasance in office.

1,3

The next paragraph said, that because of this activity

14

f Mr. Hopkins that the Judge is therefore interested in the

15

ause and biased, prejudiced and harbors personal animosity towaris

16

he plaintiff.

17
10

The Motion to Recuse was filed pursuant to the Louisian i
tafcute which permits motions to recuse on allegations of bias.
Q

ID

At some point will you develop what is the nexus

20

.s you see it between allegations of corruption and allegations

21

f bias, or perhaps indicate there is none.

22

hat.

23

A

I am pusssled about

The nexus is that the judge inferentially know-

24

ng about the Motion to Impeach, the proceeding to impeach, initiit

/-3

u by the wltl.in the case would necessarily be biased against
6

against him on the fair assumption that it certainly isn’t
1
something that were going to endear the plaintiff to the judge.

2
That, was the essence of the claim of bias and personal animosity •
3
a fair implication, X weald think.
4
This Motion to Recuse having been filed, the judge

5
several days later issued an Order for a Rule to Show Cause why

6
appellant, Mr. Spencer, ought not be held in contempt.

The

7
order is set out on page 10 of the appendix.

It is very brief.

Q
It states. «Rin'* the language of the Louisiana contempt statute,
9

that he did file a pleading which contained scandalous, insult­
10

ing and abusive language and abusive language and irrelevant
11

ciritism of the judge of said court, which pleading was attached
12

a ereto and made a part hereof and which language particularly in
13

paragraph 4, which was the paragraph I read related to the im­

14

peachment proceeding, thereof impairs the dignity of the court
13
16

and the respect for its authority contrary to the law of the
State of Louisiana.

17
18
19

20

At that point the appellant here initiated collateral
proceedings in the United State District Court in Louisiana to
enjoin the contempt proceedings.

X do not think that is directly

relevant now.

That was an attack

on the —

What was the basis

of your claim?

21

22

Q

process, first amendment, or what?

23
24

Was it due

Q

Depriving you of what Federal right?

2

Is.

I am afraid I cannot recall.

Q

That was decided against you?

A

He alleged that the statute, Louisiana contempt

statued, violated the first amendment on its face.

Q

That was decided against you?

A

That decided against the appellant, yes. There

»as initially a three-judge court.

10

12

It was free speech,

Q

You did not appeal that?

A

He filed notice of appeal nad then withdrew after*

ards.
Another part of that proceeding was, I think it is
fair to say, that out of that proceeding Judge Dixon disqualifies
himself from sitting on the contempt hearing himself and another
judge was assigned to actually hear it.
Q

Are the issues in that Federal court action being

17

raised in this action, too?
18

A

The only issue that was disposed of in a Federal

19
Court action wasthe constitutionality of the contempt statute
20
on its face, although that was raised here initially- in the
2?
jurisdictional statement from our supplemental brief.

Here you

22
will see that we are confessiong that that ought not to be here
23
because it was not properly set forth.
24
Q

When ware your other issues ever raised in a

1

State court?

2

A

The other issues by which you mean ---

Q

They wars not litigated here»

4

A

They were raised, the invalidity of the convic­

5

tion was raised, in the Motion to Recuse in the course of the

haring before Judge Williams and in the appellant’s application

for writs of certiorari to the Louisiana Supreme Court»

Where was that?

It must be in the record some

At the bottom of that

paragraph he quotes soma of the language from the Holt case, and

then at the conclusion he says, "under these circumstances and

22

ing this Court, "found these were constitutionally protected

23

expressions of free speech and I would submit that the same

24

thing is true here."

issue of his right to
Q

2

Is that it?

4
5
S

You mean this addresses itself to 222{Hf as applied ?

A

Yes# the reference to Holt.

Q

You say this addresses itself to the constitution-•

ality of the section we have before us4.222 (3). is that?

7
S

A

Addresses itself to the charge ---

Q

What we are dealing with here is our jurisdic-

tion to hear this.

Is that right?

9
A

Wa are# and our supplemental breif conceded. —

Q

That on its face you cannot —•-

A

We have abandoned the attack on the contempt

10
1!

12

statute on its face because in my opinion it was impossible to
13
assert that it had been draw in issue properly.
14

Q

And I come back to my original question.

Then

15
you go on# as I read your supplemental brief# to say that the
16
constitutionality of 222(3)# based upon the first amendment,

as

17
applied

is that right?

Is that what you are saying here?

18
A

Mi at I am saying down here is that what we are

19
attacking is not the statute other on its face# certainly not on
20
its face.

What we are attacking is the validity of the convic-

2!
tion itself.

22
Q

You are here by appeal.

A

I am here by appeal.

23
In the supplemental brief

24
I confess that we are here incorrectly by appeal.

m tn? supple

25
mental brief .1 have asked that pursuant to Section 2103 that the
10

1

case be treated as a petition for certiorariwhich in fact was

2

one of the alternative prayers in the jurisdictional statement

3

and certiorari be granted, and that the surviving issues, apart

4

from the constitutionality of the statute on its face --

5

Q

What are the "cert" issues?

6

A

The essential “cert" issue --

7

Q

Before you get to the "cert" issue let me ask

i

3

you this.

9

had been included in your jusigdictional statement, is it possi­

If what, is not disclosed in your supplemental brief

10

ble that there would have been a dismissal out of hand of the

11

whole proceeding'?

12

A

I would not make that prediction, Your Honor.

13

Q

If you admit now that you had no basis for being

14
15

16
17
IS
19

here on appeal —
A

That is right, but I think we have an excellent

basis for being here by way of certiorari,,
Q

You have not filed for petition for certiorari.

You filed an appeal, is that correct?
A

Yes, an appeal -- notice of appeal was filed from

20

the decision of Louisiana Supreme Court and then a jurisdiction

21

statement was filed here.

22

conclusion at page 13 said that thequestion presented by the

23

appeal is substantial, and alternatively in the event this

24

appeal is rejected armeilant prays that the paper be treated

25

in this petition for writ of certiorari.

The jurisdiction statement in its

11

If I had drawn that document, I would have made a
1
petition for certiorari in the first place,, and necessarily we
2
are now here asking that it be treated as a petition for certi­
3
orari.
4
Q

Where else, Mr„ Wulf, did yon raise any Federal

5
constitutional matters in the trial court other than at page
S
18?
7
A

X think that was the most explicit.

Q

While you are about it, Mr. Wulf, will you point

S
9

out what the issues on "cert" are that you think are now be­

10

fore us?

11

12
13
14

I gather this is the First Amendment issue?
A

It is essentially a Holt vs. Virginia issue.

Q

That is what I mean.

A

Which is a due process, First Amendment and devoi<ji

of evidence issue as 1 read that case.

15

Q

16

You mean that anything that Holt vs. Virgina

dealt with is raised by that?

A

Yes, sir,

You hope„

I hope, yes, sir,

What other "cert1" issues are there?

Well, certainly the central Holt issue is raised

his applications for writs to the Louisiana Aupreme Court, he

Q

I know that, but if there were a rule in Louisiana

chat you must raise the issues in the trial court to have them
considered in the appellate court, then you have not raised the
issue as soon as you can in a State court.

A

We raised the Holt issue in the trial court,

Q

The other side of it, what I am suggesting, is

that there is something about this Louisiana practice which

makes that form a disposition on the merits, not merely a

denial of review such as it would be here.

They are that the conviction

The last issue is the no evidence issue along the line

of Thompson vs, Louisville which in fact was one of the grounds

in the Holt case although it did not precisely refer to Thompson

a

petition for certiorari.

Am I correct?

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

This, therefore, I gather is an inadvertent

misstatement in your opening brief to the effect that the juris­

2

dictional statement was filed on August 9# 1959 and probably

**■;

■CJ

7

jurisdiction was noted on February 2, 1370.

That is a misstate-

mem: of fact.

A

That is a misstatement which I corrected in the

supplemental brief.
Q

You now concede there is no proper field here

3

and what you are presenting is a petition for certiorari which y ot .

9

are asking us to grant?

10

A

Yes , sir „ grant and deal with on the merits pre­

11

cisely as it would have dealt with the merits of the appeal if t ll

12

appeal were properly here.

13

X might say with respect to the application for certio

14

ari that this Court has not infrequently considered issues of

15

contempt visited on lawyers by tike bench as a very important as­

16

pect, both as to its constitutionality and its supervisory duty
■i

17

over the conduct of litigation in the lower Federal courts.

18

isre been several dozen contempt cases here in one form or another

19

There

I would suggest that that, itself indicates the signi­

20

ficance of these kinds of cases where lawyers are held in contempt

21

by the bench and X think that the issue, quite apart from that,

22

even if there never had been & case of this sort here before,

23

that quite apart from that is is an important question on its

24

own merits and does implicate 'the independence of the bar and

23

raises serious questions about the bar being free from the
-

16

~

1

imposition of arbitrary sanctions by judges and merabers of the

2

bench„

3

I would just like to concentrate for a moment on this

4

case in relationship to the Holt vs. Virginia.

3

light it is a very easy case in that it is controlled directly

6

and entirely by Holt vs. Virginia.

Looked at in that

7

In Holt there are two lawyers who were held in con-

3

tempt for filing a motion for change of venue in that case in

9

which they cha red that, the judge there,

"is now in effect and

10

or in racfc acting as a police office, adverse witness for the

11

defense, grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge."

12

charged that the judge had, intimidated and harassed attorney

13

Gulp at an earlier hearing on a. contempt proceeding.

14

uhe&eupon, on hearing this motion read in open court, said ”1

15

think the plea is contemptuous.

The judge

The Virginia Supreme Court held that the motion vio­

This had to do with a person

after the occurrence was there ever again any mention of the
existence of such a petition*

During the Federal .court litiga­

tions, with the attendant ill publicity, Judge Dixon was elected

by the voters of his district to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeal, hardly an event consistent with an action for his remova
for corruption, favoritism, oppression and misfeasance.

Williams, the Judge who was going to hear the contempt.

any evidence by any process indicating that before he filed this

these acts of misconduct.

He wanted to prove that Judge Dixon had confered

court.

He wanted •— he said something vaguely about his long

disputation between himself and Judge Dixon, part of which is
reported in — not really reported but. a case that arose out of

Williams refused to admit any such evidence.
