ARGUMENT OF HUGH B. COX
ON BEHALF' OF APPELLEES
GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY CO.

5
MR. COX;

6

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

8

9

Mr. Cox, you may proceed

This morning I shall discuss the exchange ratio.

The

negotiations over that ratio extended for more than three and a

10

half and, as it was observed yesterday, each of the two companies

11

here was advised by an independent company of investment bankers.

12

Northern Pacific by Morgan Stanley and the Great Northern by

13

First Boston.
Now as Mr. Dailey indicated, perhaps the greatest

14
15

problem in these negotiations was the natural resource proper­

m

ties of the Northern Pacific.

17

sides of the bargaining table that if you looked at merely rail­

18

road properties and railroad earnings, the Great Northern was

19

entitled to a very substantial premium in this exchange ratio.

20

But the Northern Pacific’s position was that its natural resource

2!

properties entitled it to parity, share after share.

It was agreed by everyone on both

The Great Northern took the position that that was not

22
23

the case.

24

on historic record of earnings it was entitled to a substantial

25

preference in this exchange ratio and it took different positions

It said even with the natural resource earnings, based

110

i

about the amount of that preference, but toward the end of the

2

negotiations it said that giving due allowance to the resources

3

it was entitled to about a 20 percent premium,

4
5
0

Q

Does the Great, Northern own any substantial non­

railroad income-producing properties?
A

No,

I has some industrial properties, but I

7

think you can fairly say as a general matter that the earnings

8

represent earnings from railroad activities.

9

Q

I suppose it does own real estate,

10

A

Yes, it has some industrial real estate and some

II

properties of that kind, but nothing like the properties of the

12

Northern Pacific.

13

X think that has to be said.

This went on until 1960.

At that time, and I think thi C'

14

is rather significant, the banking advisors of Northern Pacific,

15

Morgan Stanley, suggested the compromise that was finally adoptee

16

the exchange ratio that the parties agreed to.

17

Now that was described yesterday.

I would merely like

18

to say this about the ratio.

19

that it gives the shareholders of Northern Pacific in the long

20

term an equal share in the equity of this new company, but at

21

the same time it gives an immediate but not a lasting recognition

22

through this preferred stock to the historical fact that the

23

earnings and dividends of the Great Northern had been greater

24

at the time the exchange ratio was established.

25

The reasoning that underlies it is

Now this compromise proposed by Morgan Stanley was
111

f

1

approved by both investment banking houses, by the Board of

2

Directors of each company and it was twice approved by the stock

3

holders of Northern Pacific, once in 1961 and once last year' in

4

1968 .

5

stockholders.

6

stockholders who voted against it.

7

of the stockholders voted against it.

8
9

In each occ?ision it was approved by 3 percent of the
The first time there were about 6 percent of the
The second about 2 percent

I think it must said about 2 percent declined on that
vote, that the committee conducted a proxy fight and they did

10

ask that those who favored their point of view not vote as well

n

as vote against, so that without that part accounted for the

\z

decline in the votes.

13
14

15

But the committee in the proxy fight presented all the
arguments that they presented here.
Now the Commission and our Examiner both found that

16

this ratio was just and reasonable.

17

it fairly represented the contribution that each group of share­

18

holders made to the new enterprise.

19

I think the impression might have been left with the Court yes­

20

terday that the Commission based its approval of the ratio solely

21

on the finding that there was arm’s length bargaining.

22

The Commission found that

I emphasize that fact becaus e

It did find t^hat there had been arm's length bargaining

23

but it also made this finding on fair contribution to the new

24

company by each group of shareholders.

25

The findings that were made by the Commission on the

112

1

fairness of the ratio, we submit, are supported by substantial

2

evidence.

3

Commission's finding that this ratio fairly represented the con­

4

tribution made by each group of shareholders.

S

based finally on an appraisal of earnings, both an appraisal of

6

the past earnings to which there was evidence before the parties

/

and which was before the Commission, and in judgment about the

8

earnings in the future, including the earnings of the natural

9

resources properties.

10

There was a great deal of evidence to support the

The ratio was

The parties didn't use any arithmetical formula, but

n

they reached a judgment about that and established the exchange

12

ratio accordingly.
Now the committee seems to make really two points about

13
14

the evidence.

IS

based on an asset appraisal, an appraisal of the market value

IS

of these properties.

17

dence about that before the Commission, but 1 think that is not

18

quite a complete account of what did happen.

19

the railroads here got independent asset appraisals from inde­

20

pendent firms of the more important of these properties and in

21

their direct testimony before the Commission, the executive of

22

the railroad applicants testified about these appraisals and

23

explained why they didn’t use them in establishing the exchange

24

ratio.

25

They complain about the fact that the ratio wasn't

They suggest that there was really no evi­

z

mission,

5

as earnings.

6

even the independent firms who made them in some instances said

7

they weren't sure that they reflected market value.

The Commission had some evidence about the asset
They weren t

They were not reliable

There were enormous differences between them and

3

The committee also complains that not enough weight

9

was given to the earnings of the natural resources properties

10

of the Northern Pacific.

It says they should have been valued

11

at 50 times easrnings or perhaps 22 and a half times earnings,

12

but I submit there is nothing in the record that required the

13

Commission to accept those particular arithmetical formulas as

14

a standard for judging the legality of this exchange ratio.
The 50 times earnings, at the time it was testified to

15
16

would have produced a value for the natural resources property

\1

of the Northern Pacific alone, which was $90 million higher than

?8

the total stock market value of the entire enterprice, including

19

railroad properties.
It would have produced a valuation that was $280 mil­

20
21

lion more than the amount that -the committee proposed that these

22

properties be sold for in connection with the divestiture pro­

23

posal that the committee put before the Commission.

24

formula really didn't come within any measurable distance of

25

reality.

114

So that

8

The 22 and a half times formula, if applied to the

2

five years before 1960 when the exchange ratio was determined,

3

produces an exchange ratio that is a little less favorable to the

4

Northern Pacific stockholders than the ratio they actually

S

received.

6

That is true if you apply in some more recent years.
Nor the committee can apply it to certain yars and

7

get results that they say show that the ratio wasn't fair.

These

8

computations are in our brief and in their brief.

a

to think that what, they show is that with one of these arith­

I am inclined

to

metical formulas you can get different results if you apply them

it

to different years.
But the fact is that there was substantial evidence

iz

n

before the Commission about all the matters the parties con­

14

sidered in relation to earnings, the various things that affected

IS

earnings in the past and what might affect them in the future, tc

16

indicate that this exchange ratio had a substantial basis.

17

that evidence was all before the Commission and is discussed in

18

detail.

19

1.1 pages in the Commission's report that sets out this evidence.

20

Now what I have said about the finding as to the fair­

And

There are about 28 pages in the Examiner's report, about

21

ness of the contribution that each group of shareholders made

22

to the company, 1 think could also be said about the finding that

23

there was arm's length bargaining.

24

Commission made that finding and the Examiner made it after

25

hearing testimony from the executives who participated in these
115

Both the Examiner and the

1

negotiations and from the representatives of the banking house

2

which participated and advised the two companies.

3

I think that I understand what the committee's point

4

of view is»

5

Commission may have given too much weight to some evidence and

6

not enough weight to another, or perhaps they prefer their infer-

1

ences to the inferences that the Examiner and the Commission drex?

8

from the evidence.

9
10

1 think they believe, no doubt sincerely, that the

But I think it cannot be said really that these find­
ings lack support and substantial evidence in the record.

11

Nov/ the committee makes another contention which was

12

referred to briefly yesterday, and that is that the Commission

13

abused its discretion in 1968 when it didn't reopen this record

14

and retry the issue of the fairness of the exchange ratio.

15

have discussed that point in our brief and replied to the show­

16

ing that they have made as to changed conditions with analysis ox

17

those conditions which we submit show that the matters on which

IS

they rely to not really support the argument that the Commission

19

abused its. discretion.

The shipping public virtually to a man, and I emphasise that
word "virtually to a man," is solidly behind this merger as
directed by the Interstate Commarce Commission and before this
Court today.
We cannot support the Department of Justice!s posi­
tion of what they would provide by their solution is a mere

basically my part of the presentation is to give the facts of

9

points I would like to touch on in the time that I have here.

The third thing, the vast amount of com­

the merger is accomplished.

Fourth, the tremendous number of

safeguards that the Interstate Commerce Commission has built
into the order that is before this Court today to protect us fron
rate discrimination and service discrimination, some really
wonderful safeguard.

And lastly, the $40 million saving, the

benefits that will directly accrue to the shipping public from
the manifesting of those savings to the railroads involved.
Now coming specifically, are the shippers that I repre­
sent here today, are they the pawns of the railroads?
the ones swayed by 'the brochure?

valiantly for something over ten years, even before the official

That cannot — the value of that cannot

It increases the shelf life of our perish­
It reduces the

inventory requirements for the stocks out in the West, where we
have such tremendous distances, that reduces icing and refrigera­
tion costs, that produces less inventory requirements.

119

I

All of this is tremendous to us.

It will make one to

2

two days’ difference into the Kansas City-Midwest markets and at

3

least a day’s net final difference to us to and from the Chicago

4

market, not on hot-shot one-train westbound a day, but on basic

5

all-freight that is so critical to the marketing of the Pacific

6

Northwast.

7

We will have faster north-south as well as east-west

8

service.

A second part of this is the dependability of the

9

service.

After this merger the merged railroads will have two,

m

not one, lines, which will give us dependability when there is

ii

weather washouts, detaiIntents and other things that repeatedly

12

occur on railroads of the type of the operation here.
But m$re importantly, on the dependability is the

13
14

fact that they will be using vastly shorter routes to and from

15

the key marketsFor example, the rrecord shows right now that

16

15 million car-milesxa year will be saved by the new short routes

17

that will be utilized by this merged line in the operation after

18

merger is accomplished.

Unfortunately in the West we raise strawberries in

earlier will save 639,000 car-days a year by using the faster

Is there any possibility of rate competition

A

Any possibility of rate competition?

Yes, sir,

there is, and in the area in which we compete we have given them
■

s

quite a bit of rate competition and we find that in many instances

7

that the Northern Lines and w® do not at all see eye to eye, and

3

before the Commission, and before the Courts we are on opposite

9

sides as we try to adjust our rates on commodities to or from

10

certain territories, and the Northern Lines have appeared to pro­

t!

test and try to prevent our rate changes from taking effect.

12

Q

Would you say service competition is more usual

13

than rate competition?

I would say by and large that rate competition is

15

the more troublesome factor and the mare likely to be at issue

between the railroads.

The conditions?

12

A

Absent the conditions, the Milwaukee took a very

strong position in opposition to the merger.

13

14

Q

Why?

15

A

Because the merger would permit the improvement

16

of service by the Northern Lines, permit them to offer their

17

shippers more than they can offer today, permit them to give

18

many of these benefits that the Milwaukee's conditions will

I would like to, if I may, answer one point that came

23

up yesterday and then to finish a point which I started yesterday

24

and did not conclude.

25

Now it has been argued by the other side that our
136

*s

position in this case is am amorphous one.

2

it is very clear and it is simply this:

3

Section 52 of the Co-raeree Act, when read in the light of the

4

national transportation policy, does not authorize a merger whici|t

S

destroys very substantial competition among healthy railroads

6

who dominate their territory in the absence of a serious trans­

7

portation need which cannot otherwise be met.

8
9

We think it is not,

As a matter of law,

Now, Mr. Justice White asked what kind of mergers will
this permit?

Well first, it will permit a vast number simply

30

because most roads are not in competition with one another or

11

if they are in competition with one another, it may very well be

12

in a relatively small area that they cover.

13

rather negligible.

14

The overlap may be

Secondly, tills would not prevent mergers

of strong

15

with weal: roads, even if they are competing.

16

types of mergers, we think, are theprincipai ones which Congress

17

contemplated when it passed the 1920 and 1940 Acts, mergers

18

which would strengthen the smaller and weaker roads and contri­

19

bute to the development of competing systems, and the legislative

20

history is discussed in our brief at page 30.

21

Now these two

Finally, you do have the healthy dominant roads who are

22

head-to-head competitors and what kind of needs would justify

23

their merger?

24
25

Well in our view examples of serious transportation
needs would include, first, a need to remedy inadequate service

137

I

which cannot other be made adequate»

2

opening up an expensive new area to serve for some reason, and

3

it comes to mind the Alaskan frontier where new oil discoveries

4

have been made and it is very difficult to reach.

Perhaps this might, involve

5

Second, a demonstrated inability of the merging roads

6

to separately serve expanding or projected new shipper markets.

7

Third, a need to shore up a weak or failing line,

8

whose services, while essential, cannot be maintained without

9

the drastic remedy of merger, and here comes to mind the Penn

10
1!

Central merger.
Fourth, a need for a restructuring in order to restore

12

effective competitive balance in a major area.

merger of the Milwaukee with one of the Northern Lines, if

Milwaukee cannot otherwise be made viable.

have two effects:

17

competitors in the northern tier instead of the situation that

18

is created by this merger where one enormously dominant company

19

and one relatively weak competitor would be left.

20

a merger would involve only a relatively small amount of competi­

21

tion being eliminated.

22

As a hypotheti­

Such a merger would

I think that is the term he used.
The only

report is the statement of the Commission that the policy of the

2

Act is clearly to facilitate and thereby to foster and encourage

3

consolidations which can be shown to be consistent with the

public interest.

5

language that the benefits of the merger outweigh the loss of

6

competition >

And then it went on to rely upon conclusive

Well now, as I started to argue yesterday, we think th<

7

8

ICC did give, up too easily on these less drastic alternatives.

9

At 321 of the record said, in the second report denial of the

10

applications for the purpose of preserving competition between

11

the Northern Lines would merely perpetuate the existing dominance-

12

of the GN arid the NP in the northern tier.

13

to say it would relegate the Milwaukee to an increasingly margi­

14

nal and deteriorating role.

And then it went on

We do not think with the vast power of the ICC to

15
16

supervise, as McLean Trucking indicates that it has, that this

17

statement fairly reflects the alternatives that the Commission

13

does have.

19

to order thru-routes and to open gateways when this is "needed

20

in order to provide adequate and more efficient or more economic

21

transportation."

22

For example, under Section 54 of the Act ICC has powejr

And we think that if there is a transportation need

23

for this merger, why then we say that here is a less drastic

24

remedy which should first be exhausted.

25

In conclusion, I would just like to point out we think
139

1

this case involves an issue of the utmost urgency and importance

2

going to the enormous changes in the nation's railroad structure

3

which are now talking place, in particular.

4

The proposed merger represents a crucial and a far-

3

reaching step in the restructuring of the western rail system.

6

If the Commission's approach to this case is valie, other roads

7

in other areas can present similar cost savings and service

8

improvement evidence and it is difficult to see how ICC could

9

turn down any major proposal for a merger of parallel compeitors

10

even where they are dominant.

U

At. stake, I seriously say to the Court, is the whole

12

question of rail competition and we say that it should not be

13

discarded.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
In oral argument before this Court the proponents of

the merger have chosen not to meet the committee's argument,

the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee *s argument, on the merits,

24

and have chosen to rely on their briefs.

25

It is suggested here that the tide of difficult argu­
ments

of economic imponderables largely attached to the antitrust

2

issue not be allowed to sweep away the arguments of the Living­

3

ston Anti-Merger Committee.

note once more that the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee raises

6

the threshold issues in these consolidated cases.

In summary? the Livingston Anti-Merger Corami ttee
claims that ownership of the federally chartered right-of-way is
a jurisdictional element.

If the right-of-way is not owned by

a merger applicant or party petitioning for inclusion in the
merger? and the committee claims that is isn't? the Commission
has no jurisdiction.
Secondly? even assuming the Commission has jurisdic­

of title to the federally chartered right-of-way? the merger

is still barred by statutory law and contract.

It is barred

by the provisions of the Federal charter which were imposed upon
the road when Congress granted the road in the first place.
And those two provisions — there are two provisions.
One prohibits the merger and the other prohibits mortgage with­
out congressional consent.

If Railway succeeded-to the title of

the main line right-of-way federally chartered to Railroad? then
141

Railway also succeeded to the liabilities and obligations

and burdens that that title carries.

burdens are "no merger" and "no mortgage without congressional

consent."
