Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

New York City and the five boroughs of which

10

is comprised, is the only jurisdiction in this country which

punishable by as much as one year’s imprisonment.

the remaining 57 counties of the State of New York, a person
is- entitled to a jury trial of sisc, requiring a unanimous
verdict.
Thus, the question which this case brings to this
Court, whether Section '40 of the New York City Criminal Court
Act, set forth on Pages 3 and 4 of our brief, violates the 6th
Amendment, as applied to the states in the 14th. In denying
jury trial for what we deem to be a serious offense, and also'

of New York, whether the ecrual protection clause is so violated.
The record facts inthis case are relatively simple.

How does the

i

1

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Primarily, Mr. Justice Harlan,

z

in that the State of New York, making available to all its

3

residents, except those who reside in the City of New York,

4

the right to a jury trial.

5

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

what you are saying, in

6

effect, is that every State must be exactly the same.

7

state, city, county.

3
9

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

'

Every'

Well, no, Your Honor. I'm saying

that where the state has undertaken to provide most of its

10

other citizenryt apart from one city, with the right to a jury -

11

trial, given what this Court has said inDuncan about the imoor?-

IE

tance of the.right to jury trial as provided by the state.

13

Indeed, in deciding Duncan, this Court looked to the states to

14

see how important that right was and they found that it was-

15

applied and provided for in all the states.

16

17
18

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, I was really just

pushing your argument just one step beyond that, that once you
have a fixed cutoff time in one state the citizens of every

IS

other state which does not comply with that favorably, is in­

20

volved in an equal protection problem.

21

22

23
24
25

MR. HELLERSTEIN:
Your Honor's question.

Oh, Your Honor, I misunderstood

If that's all that's involved, then

there is no problem there, because New York is the only state
-- New York City,

X mean — is the only city that has the

problem that is before this Court, namely: the right to a jury
3

I

trial for a year and we don’t have to equalize anything among

2

the other states, because this Court has already decided that a

3
4
S
6

six months period of time on the fence is petty, and since all
the other state's do not deprive anybody of a jury trial for a
year's time, then there is no equalisation applied between New
York and the rest of the country»
There is equalisation required between New- York

7
8
9

City and the rest of the state, but I would like to get to that
equal protection argument a bit later»

court and was denied.

The New York Court of Appeals, by a

majority decision, 5 to. 2, felt that this Court’s decision in
Duncan did not require a holding that one year was a serious
i

crime, nor did it require any different holding on equal protect
tion.

The justices that dissentedf Judges Burke and Keating,

took a much different view and, of course, is much more con­
sonant with our position.

j

Essentially, our Sixth Amendment argument is really

2

broken down into three parts.

3

did not decide tills question, the thrust of Duncan., the logic

4

of Duncan, resolves the issue for us.

5

We think that although Duncan

However, we also feel that if Your Honors were to

6

credit Mew York’s looking to its own historic experience to

7

deprive the Appellant of a jury trial, and even under what we

8

concede to be erroneous criteria, our argument still prevails.

S

And the people have misunderstood our argument on this point

10

because they seem to say

in their brief that we offer it to

11

the Court as an affirmative indication of our position.

12

I’m only saying that if we were forced to, we

13

could win our case, even on the criteria that the Court of

14

Appeals followed, even though we think its wrong.

13

Thirdly, I think perhaps the ghost in the closet on
has to be
this case,/the question' of the impact of the Court’s decision,

16
n

25

on the criminal court problem in Hew York City =, because I
really believe that if this case had come from Casanovia,•as'the
people would have it, this would not be a consi** ^ration.
Now, although the Hew York Court of Appeals spoke
cf the problems-of the New York Criminal Court on the equal
protection issue, I can’t help but feel Iwwauid like to come
to grips with that end of the argument of the Sixth Amendment,
lurking behind this problem that the Court faces, is the
problem of the calendar chaos of the New York Criminal Court.

Hence, looking towards the decision in Duncan, as

call the objective criteria, chiefly the existing laws and
•

7

.

Looking to national criteria- the Court found that

S

nowhere else in the land was a two-year sentence countenanced

9

without a right to jury trial.

10
11

Applying that method of analy-

sis, the Court would arrive at the same conclusions respecting
New York City; namely that nowhere else in the land does a.

12

situation prevail in which the defendant facing one year's

imprisonment was denied a right to jury ferial,

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

I thought there were a lot of ■«

states, though, although they gave a jury trial

the one-year,

misdemeanor type of case, they had six man juries and what not,
MR. HELLERSTEIN: Yes.

i
I think, Mr. Justice Harlan,;

you are getting to' what the people are, and they hang their
case on it, I might say; namely; that our ’position depends on
whether we are entitled to a common-lav jurv or not.

And I

think this is an ^rror, for the same reason that it was an error
or at least was irrelevant

to

’fehs decision-in Duncan.

Primarily

Justice Portas in his concurring opinion in Bloom, Mr. Justice-.

whether the entire bag and baggage of the Sixth

The unanimous jury, the 12-man jury — I think,

4
5

again, this is a question left open in this case and one which

6

we n'eed not resolve, because all, I think, and depending on

7

Duncan, that we are asking for, is some form of a jury trial.
For instance, in Louisiana, after Duncan, the jury

8
9

trial which is now provided is not a common-lav/ unanimous jury?

10

it is a five-man jury for the one-year crime.

11

did was they knocked a lot of crimes down to six months and

12

for the ones that were over they provided a five-man jury.,

13
n
15

What Louisiana

1

don8t think the record in this case, nor the issues in this
case have to depend on whether a Sixth Amendment jury with
its bag and baggage, is reqiuLred.

What the New York Court of Appeals did thatfor, is

21

*

they looked away from Duncan and at least read

, looking

to its own historical experience? namely, that in New York we
have always considered a misdemeanor a petty offense and a
felony a serious offense and the one year decided which was
which„
But the six-month cutoff, nationwide, even historcally, has much more support with respect to the issue of the
jury trial, than does the one-year cutoff upon which the people
and the New York Court of Appeals based their opinion..

7

K

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now, if we adopted your

Z

argument, this would preclude the idea of any states cutting

3

back as they find jury trials.more difficult to adminster?

4

MR. HELLEPETEIN: I think, Your Honor, it would

S

preclude the state from denying a jury trial to anything more

6

than a six-months period of imprisonment.

7

the Court, upon reconsideration of a decision, could be forth­

a

coming in this case, and in Duncan, might reconsider the whole

9

record of what the problem was.

Unless, of course,

I think that it is interesting in the People’s

10
n

brief, they attempt to call the Court's attention to the

12

Minnesota experience with requiring a jury trial in certain

1.3

lesser crime situations by showing that delays were resulting.

14

Their brief doesn't reflect, however, the next two lines of the

15

Minnesota Lav/ Review Article, which also discloses that the Bar

16

Association of Minnesota, in response to the delay and the

i?
m
m

zo
21

question of whether the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court
should be made in

, recommended that it was much more

important to retain the* jury system than to disregard it' as- a
result of some momentary shortages of space and facilities, and
I will get to that again later.

-

The six-month cutoff has historical significance,
This Court, in Duncan, mentioned the fact that for the most
part in the 18th Century, the six-month ..cutoff., with exception,
was a general experience.

Also it the reason why New York8 s experience doesn't

experienced that the colonies had.had„

4

as Justice Frankfurter in his article with Mr. Corcoran# point

5

out# were much harsher in their denials of trial by jury than

6

many of the other colonies.

7

exactly what's at stake is not really a fruitful thing# but I

8

think we have got the better of it in terms of isa fact that

9

there were more lenient policies«

10

New York# Hex* Jersey and

So# we attempt to locate in history

I think it is interesting to note that at least two

11

commentators# Professors Goebel and NaUghton# in our brief#

ia

think that the New York denial of jury trial is serious arid in

13

petty offenses or serious offenses# depending on where you

14

place the label, have something to do with the aristocratic

structure of the colony.
I veiw the New York experience# although we affirm
it consistently over the years by the court# as sort of a v^stirs
of this old colonial policy.
The dissenting opinion# as we do# took the position
that you couldn't tell# even if you looked to the New York
..experience# that the citizens of New York had not opted, had
not felt that over six months was a serious offense.

And the

reason that the legislation had given a jury trial elsewhere
inthe state# and that at the recent Constitutional Convention#
the elected representative of the people# drafted the

constitution with. a new provision which this Court called

attention to in Duncan, that would have limited the denial of

a jury trial to a six months period.

7

So, 1 don't think the Hew York Court of Appeals is

S

right in saying that the Hew York citizenry do not view a one-

9

year sentence as a serious crime»
MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

10
n

How long has this dichotomy

existed between New York City and the rest of the state?

12

MR. HELLERSTEIN;

The dichotomy has existed — it

13

was the history of Hew York entirely, until 1824 when the

14

legislature cut back and said to the rest of the state, we will

15

provide some form of jury trial.

16

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

Up until 1824 it was all

17

analogous to what New York City is now.

13

MR. HELLERSTEIH;

It is curious, as we point out in

19

our brief, it's interesting that in 1878 the Hew York Court of

20

Appeal's said, when Confronted with the question of the validity

21

of that choices "We no longer can see the reason for denying a

22

jury trial to the citizens of New York."
Of course now, the reasons have ttecomra a bit more

23
■

24

sanguine, you might say.

The city has grown and its problems

25

have become so immense, but in 1878 the New York Court of

10

1

Appeals, not having, not fee liner itself possessed of an equal

2

protection argument just declined to answer the question on a

3

constitutional basis, although it is not a. violation of the New

4

York State Constitutions and let is go at that; but they com­

5

mented that they couldn't see the distinctions

6

7

MR. JUSTICE MUTE: Is there legislation pending in
York on this question now?

8

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

9

MR. JUSTICE MIITE:

10
n

No? not to my knowledge,,
It would have been included in

the constitution that was turned down?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes.

And there have been constant

12

efforts by various groups to have it, you know, brought up, but

!3

there is nothing pending that I know of .in the State Legislature.

14

The People have attempted to draw Your Honors'

15

f
attention in their brief, and I think that superficially it has

16

a lot of trappings, but I think down deep it really doesn't cut

1?

too deeply, by trying fcoconvince you that one year as a cutoff

18

really has a lot of sense, a lot of historical sense in our

19

national history.

20

really is a felony-misdemeanor distrnctidn tha'fc goes to such

21

things'as the right tojury trial? the right ' toindicfcment for
/
this crime, the collateral effect of the conviction of a mis­

22.
23
24
25

But, the one-year cutoff-which they refer fee

demeanor, as distinguished from a felony, and the place of in­
carceration, with respect to —
But it’s interesting at this ona-year distinction

11

t

that they attempt to draw.

z

any state,, except New York, with respect to the right to jury

3

trial.

4

between felony and misdemeanor, as a one-year crime, in terms

5

of who gees to what prison? but with respect tothe jury trial

&

a common-law jury is provided in Claifornia for traffic
to
offenses. So, the one-year distinction as/the felony-misdemeanor

1

It is not a distinction as drawn by

For examples California still draws the distinction

8

really doesn't anwer anything, and combined with what I can see

9

as a much more sensible and stronger historical six-months

10

position, really wipes itself out.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

n
12
'13

question raised under the constitution on the basis of what is
sensible?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

22
23
24

25

Well, can we decide this

Justice.

Maybe I chose the wrong word, Mr.

Sensible, to me, means .logically consistent with the

prior decision, and I think what^I'm suggesting here is
logically consistent with the language in the thrust of Duncan.
The commentators who have analysed Duncan have so rested.

Those

are the authorities we cite in our brief.
I think, dince Duncan looked to the nation as a
whole and said, "Let us see what is doing in the other states,
that that issue was the result and the only thing that was
left hanging was the New York situation.
The right also to attempt to tie a one-year serious
petty to the incident of the" right toindict, can5t work very
12

t

well, either;, because only eight states inthis country

a

guarantee the right to indict — now, most states guarantee

3

the right to jury trial, as set forth in our appendix, don't

4

really care about indictment and I would presume to say that

5

if 1 thought there was one provision in the Bill of Rights that

S

would probably not be incorporated, apart from the Second

7

Amendment, would have to be therighfc to indictment.

8

ships, the literature on the subject, is against the grand jury

9

indictment, rather than for.

The schola::

10

1 think anyof the old cases,

perhaps,

it would be for —
Also, the place of confinement, it had 22 states as

13

demeanors go to county jails.

14

analytical worth to Your Honors, mainly because it's only ??.

IS
16
17
18

states, but this distinction arises out of concepts- of■infamy,
concepts-of finance, why should a local administration have'to
bear the costs of a serious felon, when the state could take a
more proper interest.
And, indeed in New.York, one of the blunders o_f the,

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

I. don't think there is any

penal law, even with its recent modification is that felons can
go to the county jail, which we call the- New York City Peni­
tentiary.

This is something ..the legislat’ 'e would like to

resolve, but right now it is a matter <$$¥ practice, felons do go
to Riker’s Island, which is the penitentiary.
i

So, what, you really don't, as I see it, get much
13

i

mileage out of the distinctions that are to be drawn by the

2.

People»

torical»

The collateral effects are also time-tried and his­

I think, given the nature of the New York City
criminal population, most of the people faced with the mis­
demeanor conviction, the loss of misdemeanor collateral conI would
sequences are much more severe and/think, certainly neutralize
the Court of Appeal emphasis on the felony collateral effects»
I think the most difficult part, of the case in
terms of the psychology of both below and perhaps here, what
the Court conceives of as a problem in the New York City
Criminal Court»
New York. City Criminal Court is in chaos and it has
been in the past in chaos for a long time to the extent — I
don’t know how

to convey to you, the feeling I would like to if

I could take you throucfh our Court Houses.

I have tried to

document? 1 would not dare make the claims I have made in my
brief without documentation, of what it is like? what the process
14

!

of justice has become in our Criminal Court»
The turnstile feeling; the feeling by the minority

population, which participates very heavily in that court, of

4

what it is like to have a judge —• to be apart and watch the

5

judge decide his 15th case of.the day.

meant, I think, by this- Court to protect a defendant against a

judge, for whatever the reasons may be, from being case»

hardened? from being worn down by the system and the burdens of

the court, as we have -pointed out, with the addition of new

judges, as we assume,/the elimination of the three-judge court

12

would not create much more difficulty»

any sense to permit New York to stop now and say we have only

14

so much? judges only so much and we think we have enough judges

IS

for this.

10

'16

I don*t think it makes

'
tod also one of the significant aspects of the jury

17

trial system is a heavy incidence in waiver; that it makes any

18

sense to stop, permit New York to say, "We can now stop in 1969

19

with our ~ "

-

I think New York is capable and certainly necessary
for it to respond to, what .1 think the Sixth Amendment requires»
MR» JUSTICE HARLAN;

Am I right in understanding

then that the present New York laws in a case of this kind, the
defendant can get a three-judge court as a matter of right, bymoving for it?
.15

HR. HELLERSTEINs

f

Yes.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

z

And' then if he wants a jury,

ta has to go to the Supreme Court in which it is a purely

3
Liscretionary matter with that court.

4
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Xt9s exceptionally discretionary,

5
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

It is no

different from what

S
; was brought up in, that I was interested in.

7
MR0 HELLERSTEIN:

It's really titled a faction

8
remove' as a means to prosecute by indictment and jury trial, the:

9
.aw on that, the discretion which the courts"have exercised,
10
las bean such an" arbitrary

I could gat you to see where the

11
judges themselves say, “We have no guidance on this."

12
And it is not a procedure that is used very often*

13
Just briefly, then,, the equal protection issue, we
:hink

,

is a bit more difficult because people, I think, put the if

lands on the one possible weakness in our case, and that is"
.f we are right on the 6th Amendment, we are begging the question
if
.n a way, because/we have got the constitutional right we don't
tave to work out a classification problem.
Although I would suggest that if for some reason I
;an't convince you the 6th Amendment takes us where we would lilc«3

.t, arid even without having the "Sixth Amendment, where, as I have

ORMi ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. JUVILER

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

B

9

Thank you, Mr,

MR* JUVXLER:
'c'^e Cour’c;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

!?Ile boundaries of the petty "offense cateogry, as

10

Mr. Justi.ce White said in Duncan against Louisiana, "are ill-

Vi

defined, if not ambulatory."

12

This case presents the opportunity to define those

13

boundaries.

M

relates to the alleged denial of equal protection of the laws

15

in the geographical classification adopted by the New York

16

Legislature„

A subsidiary question raised by Appellants claims,

17

I propose to rest entirely or almost entirely on our

18

brief as to that, although 1 might perhaps say something about i

m

in closing tomorrow morning.

20

The difficult question which the Court left open in

2!

Duncan, as to the boundaries of the petty offense category, does

22

not have to be resolved without guidelines, for indeed, there have

23
24

been substantial guidelines set out by this Court.
The Court has made clear that imprisonment of itself,

25 does not render an offense serious, such as to require trial by
17

I

jury»

2

punishable by no more than six months imprisonment, is a petty

3

offense.

4
5
©

It has also been stated unequivocally, that an offense

On the other hand, a crime punishable by two years
is a serious offense.

That was the holding in Duncan.

So, we have, essentially, in this case, a choice

7

between a six-month cutoff proposed by Appellants and the one-

S

year cutoff, which we urge upon the Court.

9

There is a temptation in choosing between these

10

alternatives to an a priori judgment, to say, "Well, this is

11

serious or it isn’t? I know it when I see it."

12

extensive indications? there is extensive circumstantial

13

But there are

evidence in the. experience of the states and the Federal system

14

of justice, which point predominately to the one-year cutoff as

IS

the proper boundaryas an objective boundary.

16

20
21

22

24
25

Appellant claims that New York City and provisions
for jury trial, stands alone in the entire nation in witfiholdih:
trial by jury from offenses punishable by up to one year.

But

it is not that clear as Mr. Justice Harlan implied in his
question of Mr. Hellerstein? there are juries and there are
juries, and since the issue for this Court is a constitutional
issue under the Sixth Amendment, we would bast look to the
constitutional law as to what is a jury trial.

That is a jury

which consists of 12 persons rendering a unanimous verdict at
a trial in the first instance.

18

This common-law, Sixth

!

Amendment jury is withheld in 13 states for trials of crimes

2

punishable by up to one year„

S

this boundary.

Thirteen states have adopted

Does thatinclude Hew York?

Including New York.
Because out of New York City,

as I understand it,'the right is to a six-man jury.
MR. JUVXLER:

The right to a six-man jury in all

of the other counties, for crimes punishable by up to one year.

!0

If a crime is punishable by more than one year, there is a right

II

in the entire state to a common-law Sixth Amendment jury.

\z

And thirteen other states have the same boundary

line between this hybrid jury, which the states felt free, to

14

experiment with, for crimes punishable by up to a year.

IS

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

In the hybrids, you are

including a jury of less than 12 people and also you are in­

17

cluding a trial de novo?

IS

MR. JUVILER:

Yes; there are, for example, nine

19

states in which there are fewer than 12 Jjurors for crimes

20

punishable explicitly by no more than one year; that is the

21

explicit cutoff in nine states.

22

verdict can be rendered in a case punishable by up to one year

23

as the precise cutoff and in five states there is a trial de

23

guilty of crimes punishable by up to' one year as the expressly19

If you add this all together, it!s 15, but there

really are 13 separate states, because some of the states have

4

adopted several of these hybrid procedures.

S

6

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALLs

But the real problem is

between; three judges and sis-: jurors? is that the real problem?

7

MR. JUVXLER:

The problem is that three judges, or

8

even 12 judges, are not a jury? they are not citizens, private

9

citizens interposed between the accused and the government and

10

we do not urge that a three-judge bench is a jury of three

11

persons.

12

13

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL: Well, why have three instead
of one?

14
15

MR. JUVXLER:

That is a legislative determination

in New York, which is based on long-standing history.

16

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, X think you would say there is

17

a difference between the judge and

I think it was
felt, Mr. Justice
T

20

Marshall, that in adopting a system which had no jurors at all,

21

there might be an ameliorative factor by interposing, at the

22

option of the defendant, more than one judge so that you could

have deliberation.

3

tion requires New York State or New York City to provide.

11

been found guilty.

12

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

13

MR. JUVILER:

14

But the penalties are the same.

The penalty is the same: punishment

by up t© one year.
Mow, of course, as Mr. Justice White pointed out in

15
m

Duncan, these procedures are subject to reconsideration as in

17

the case that was ordered to review yesterday, from Florida^

13

involving six jurors, but we take the law as we find it and the

19

prosecution can also find solace in the constitutional law as

20

we find it.

21
22

23
24
23

At the momen there are 13 states which would be in
violation of the constitution if this Court accepts the
Appellant's argument 'that a one-year sentence renders a crime
serious under the Sixth Amendment.
There are only six states on the other hand, which
21

1

have adopted a six-month cutoff for the provision of a jury

a

trial of any kind in the first instance,, And -that is not a

3

bulky evidence of a nationwide feeling of seriousness support­

4

ing the six-months cutoff, which Appellant proposes»
MR. JUSTICE MUTE: What do the rest of the states

a
6

do?
MR.

7

JVILER:

The majority of states provide for a

8

common-law jury at various levels of sentence.

9

18 states, including California, a full-fledged jury trial is

10

provided for any crime punishable by any imprisonment whatso­

11

ever.

For example, in

But, since the choice here is between a six-month
cutoff arad a one-year cutoff, these provisions in 18 states
which go far beyond what is required by the constitution, offer
no guidance as to which of these two cutoffs should be chosen
by the Court.

California has made clear elsewhere in its law that

there are two classes of crimes: felonies, punishable by more

has chosen in legislative wisdom to apply a full-fledged jury
ferial, even for the petty offenses.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

There are other expressions of seriousness that
point at the one-year cutoff, many of which have come after thi:'
Court's decision in the Duncan case; many of which have been
4\
effected after the Duncan decision.
The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act,
provides a provision for eavesdropping by state law enforcement
officials pursuant to court order and one of the categories of
crime that Congress has authorised to be the subject of elec­
tronic eavesdropping, is crimes punishable by more than one
year of imprisonment; not six months of imprisonment.

25

The

i

prosecutions, has been enacted by Congress after Duncan to

z

exclude and disqualify from these panels persons convicted of

3

crimes punishable by more than one year — not more than six

months -- these are the serious crimes which disqualify

3

American citisens from sitting on a grand ©r petty jury infche -

6

Federal system of justice.

7

The Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, which has been

8

adopted in 45 states? Section 14 of that Act, which I neglected

9

to'cite in the brief, adopts also a one-year'cutoff; not.a

10

six-year cutoff; adopts also a one-year cutoff, not a six-year

it is considered not serious enough, and therefore, a judge has

accurate, for the following reasons s

1

In Duncan, this Court pointed to Title 18,

3

Section 1, six-months cutoffs, and said, in a way of the

indicia of Duncan, whether the case was try&ble by the Federal

Court.

That Title I still remains? still stands and is

7

very similar to the Mew York Penal Law? both prior to —

The Federal Magistrate9s Act, which Mr. Juviler

9
10

speaJcs of and writes of, has not changed anything at all with

11

the statute of the availability of a right to jury.-trial.

12

Putting aside the constitutional considerations —

13

Mr. Chief Justice asked the question about the

S4

three-judge court and the demand, how frequently.

months, whereas * in New York,‘it's classified as a misdemeanor.

the breakdown of the Criminal Code of Penal Law of New York

and I think Your Honors will see, if you ware even curious to

look into the nature of the offense, rather than the term of

punishment imposed, that New York's C ass A misdemeanor does

0

not strike a chord in terms of petty offenses that one might
