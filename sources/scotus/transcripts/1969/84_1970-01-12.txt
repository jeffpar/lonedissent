Mr. Chief Justice, and may it. please

This is a criminal tax case brought here by direct

appeal by the United States District Court for the District of

11

Utah.

I might say at the outset that the United States
brought the case here, not because of the intrinsic importance
of the casti, much less for the revenue involved, but. rather, out

Having said that, I want to be very careful and de­
tailed in stating the facts of the case.
its I said, we're-

in. the District of Utah before the

Chief Judge, Judge Ritter.

An information is filed against

a mistrial, the jury having already been sworn, if the Governi
ment had been allowed more time in which to consider whether it
wished to-dismiss this information.
5he Government indicated that it was ready.

The

defense hac. no suggestions to make, understandably, and so the
case proceeded.

The first witness was an Internal Revenue

official who was called, simply to identify the returns which
were the subject of the charge.

It was immediately stipulated

that these were authentic returns and the witness, therefore,

■

was immediately removed from the stand.
Thereupon, the first real witness was called by the
prosecution, who was one of the taxpayers? that is, one of those
for whom a return had been prepared by the defendant, Mr. Jcrn.
As soon as the taxpayer took the stand, defense counsel, and
this appears at Page 40 of the very short record in this case,

Mr, Morrill, Defense Counsel, addresses the Court as follows:

matter, it is my feeling that each of these taxpayers should he

to talk himself into a Federal penitentiary here, so what the
Court has to say to you is this:"

And I will not read the

following two pages in which the judge quite clearly, emphatieally, in the strongest possible terms, advises the prospective
witnesses of their right not to testify for fear of incriminat­
ing themselves? of their .right to have a lawyer? of their right
to have a lawyer appointed for them, even though they are not
criminal defendants, before they testify? and then he addresses
the witness and says

— this is now on Page 41: "Well, what do

you want tc do?"
The witness responds: "You Honor, my wife and I have

18
19

had it pointed out to us that our returns had information in
them that we know is wrong and we have admitted this and I would

2,0

21

admit it further in this court»"
The judge responds: "Have you talked fco a lawyer?"

22
23
24

he says, "No, sir."

And

The Court says, "I'm not going to let you

admit it any further in this court: that is all there is about
that.

The idmissions you have already made were very likely

made without telling you what your constitutional rights are.

2

The witness says, "No, sir."

3

The Court says, "What is that?"
The witness says, "We were advised at the time we

were first contacted by the Internal Revenue Service."
The judge responds, "If you were, you are the only

about incrr.minating prospective defendants.

his disposition

18
19

to abort the trial.
The judge excusas the witness at. this point, turns

20
21

22

to the U. £. Attorney and says, "When* are your witnesses in
this case?

The U* S. Attorney replies, "Your Honor, by the tints

Q

How much was involved?

A

There were, originally, Mr. Justice Black, 25

counts, shewing exaggerated or invented deductions in amounts
ranging from, I think, for each taxpayer, totals somewhere
between $200, $300 and $400.

Eventually, 14 of those counts

were removed, but for all we know, Mr. Jorn had been involved
in this occupation for some tine and with respect to a great

Was Mr. Jorn a professional tax adviser or

consultant?

It appears from colloquy at the beginning of

of this Coart, that I need not dwell on that aspect of it.
I am willing to argue, however, on the alternative

4

S

i
basis that the defense is not to be held accountable for the
judge's arbitrary action in prematurely ..ending the trial.
And for that purpose, it seems to us we can assimilate

6
1
8

9
10

this case in every respect with Gori versus the United states,
decided by this Court some few terms ago.

There also, a judge

in what this Court characterised as “exaggerated," or perhaps
exaggerated solicitude for the defendant, without any motion
from the defense, ordered a mistrial and the question was

1!
12

13

whether the defendant could be retried subsequently and the
Court held that he could.
That decision, as well as, or prior decisions of this

14
Court on this subject, have indicated that the double jeopardy
15
«iXaug© really does not control this question in any direct
16

r/

sense.

The double jeopardy clause, historically and as this

Court has construed it, deals more immediately with the problem
18
of a case which gone to verdict, whether a verdict of acquittal!
19

20

or a verdict of conviction.
'A mistrial which is, of course, neither, bars re-

21

prosecution only in circumstances where either, and I think
22
this is this Court's decision in Dovmuffl, where to allow a re­
23

trial, would be to get around the double jeopardy clause in
24

this sense

if the defendant stood a good chance of winning an

25
9

;

!

acquiftt&l, which would have barred his retrial, he must not be

2

cheated of that right to obtain an acquittal by action — un­

3

justified action laid at the door of the prosecution.? because

Q

And, in that

The question, then, basically is one of

fundamental fairness or fundamental unfairness?
A

It could be put in terms of fundamental fair­

ness or fundamental unfairness.

We put it in terms of whether

the action of the court was taken on behalf ©f the government;
whether its effect was to harrass the defense.

We recognise

that it may be a part of the right to trial by jury, though',
aside from the double jeopardy clause, to have a case brought
to a conclusion before the jury is first 'empaneled,
0

That certainly doesn't apply in the event of

a jury that disagrees,

Nobody he*s ever claimed that after a:

mistrial caused by a hung jury that there-cannot be another

>■

prosecution,
h

And precisely that .example, an example which

indicates not a motion of the defendant? not a waiver by the
defendant, indicates that there is no absolute bar,
Mr, Justice Washington very earlier on, said the
double jeopardy clause obviously doesn't control this situation
of a mistrial, because the double jeopardy clause has no ex­
ceptions in it and we have no right to read exceptions into it.
10

i

Z

5

Therefore, this is a case not governed by the double jeopardy
clause, since everyone concedes that in the case of a hung
jury, for instance, there must be a right to the public in the
prosecution to retry

even though no argument of waiver by the

defense could possibly be advanced.

6

Is there more reason, would you say, to have

7

a stringent; rule on double jeopardy where the defendant has gone

8

forward and put in his evidence, than in the ease where his

evidence has never been reached?

12

defendant would require, in order to assert one constitutional

right, the constitutional right to reversal on constitutional

14

error, to waive his supposed other constitutional right, the

15

right not to be retried, that is right granted him by the

18

double jeopardy clause.

17

It follows from this that it.is not the defendant's

motion that makes a new trial permissible in the case of a trial

And the defendant’s motion and any notion of waiver is quite

4

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

5

MR. MORRILL:

6

the Court:

7

stated the facts.

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please:

I believe counsel for the Government has adequately
I would amplify on these in certain instances.

First, I believe it should be pointed out that a

9

peculiar relationship existed in this case between the defen­

10\ I

dant and the taxpayer witnesses called to testify against him.
1

11

The defendant was accused in the information of

12

aiding, assisting and procuring and counseling and advising in
1

13

the preparation of false and fraudulent tax returns.

The return;:

U j involved were the returns of the very witnesses who were
testifying.

15

The Internal Revenue Service had determined that these

16
17

jreturns wen; erroneous, were fraudulent in their view, therefore.

18

if defendant was not guilty of the fraud then the taxpayers may

19 ijwell have been guilty.

From the preliminary hearing in the

matter, I, being defense counsel at the time, it was my feeling

20

21 jj that some of these witnesses were trying to blame their errors
22 yon the defendant and thus escape prosecution from the Internal
23

j Revenue Service.

It was for this reason that counsel

After this warning was given, as stated by Counsel

opportunity on either side for objection.

I gather from your argument, the logic of your

argument is that the more wrong the District Judge was, the

more erroneous was his action in dismissing the jury, the

stronger your case is; do I understand you correctly?
15

In other

words, if. -here was an absolute necessity for a mistrial;, that

10

S1

ecessity and the trial judge irrationally or

That's the logic of your argument, isn’t

it?
MR. MORRILLs

Yes, Your Honor, that would be the

12

logic of iny argument.

13

of this Court that the risk of judicial arbitrariness should

14

not be placed upon the defendant, but rather should be placed

15

upon the Government in this instance.

18

It has been stated by one of the members

Then, too, I believe the position of the trial court

17

in this case is rather unique, in that the same court that

18

granted this mistrial, or discharged the jury, some five months

19

later, on reviewing his own exercise of discretion, granted

20

defendant’s motion to dismiss, based upon the double jeopardy

21

clause of the Fifth Amendment.

22

It would appear to me that this judge was in an ex­

23

cellent position to review his own exercise of discretion and

24

that in granting this motion he concluded that in his prior

25

action he had abused his discretion.
16

Abuse of this discretion

1

prejudiced the defendant, and for this reason the action in

2

dismissing the information should be affirmed.
This Court has also held in Down urn versus the United

3
4

States that a mistrial declared in the aid of prosecution would

6

prevent retrial.

6

into two parts, the first his opinion or conclusion that these

7

witnesses souId not testify and second, the dismissing oftthe

Q

jury, it appears to me that the defendant was prejudiced.

Upon separating the action of the trial judge

After concluding that the witnesses could not testify},

9
30

had the court continued the trial there is no question but what

11

a verdict of acquittal would have been forthcoming, since these

12

were all of the Government's witnesses.
In both the Gori case and the Tateo case, relied upon

13
14

by the Government, retrial was allowed after a mistrial in the i

15

one case? after conviction in the other.

16

tect the rights of the accused.

17

rather heavily on that argument: the rights of the accused were

18

Then, I suppose what you are saying is that

he actually could, but it wouldn't be legal.

This is true? this is true.

It is the

15

defendant's position that once the jury was empaneled, evidence

16

was taken from one witness? another witness was sworn, jeopardy

17

attached and pursuant to the United States Constitution, the

18

Fifth Amendment, and the cases of this Court, the defendant

cannot now be retried.

21

Either this appeal should be dismissed because, under
Section 3731 if jeopardy had attached, no appeal would lie, or
the action of the court below should be affirmed.
Thank you.

OFFICE OF TBS SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF

One comment, Mr. Chief Justice.

OF THE APPELLANT

MR. CLAIBORNEs

I agree with counsel that the

6

question in this case is correctly stated in the quotation made

?

attributed to a. member of this Court that the issue is where

S

the risk of judicial arbitrariness must fall in these circum-

9

stances.

That statement is taken from tha dissenting opinion

10

in Gbri versus the United States.

n

in that sane case, which has been repudiated, not by the

12

Downum decision, or by the subsequent decision in Tateo versus

13

the United States.

14

We invoke majority opinion

t
it seems to us that the balance of considerations

15

here requires that in this case where a judge as this judge, we

IS

must conclude, has, arbitrarily and without the need for doing

1?

so, declare.s a mistrial, but not at the instance of the Govern­

18

ment , • not to the advantage of the Government, that the pro­

19

visions of the double jeopardy clause do not prevent retrial of

20

the defendent.

21

C

j
When a trial judge approaches, or gives: some

22

indication of contemplation of mistrial in the circumstances

23

where they ara not warranted, is there any remedy which the

24

Government has that you know of?

25

by mandamus; is his order reviewable in any way by any court?

Can they effectively reach him

to seek mandamus from the High Court, nothing would prevent a
high court from entertaining and granting such a writ.

We had a case here some few years ago, invol­

ving what seemed to foe an entirely erroneous and irrational
direction of, the judgment of acquittal, up in the District of
Massachusetts.

Von Prue , I think, was the name of the case and

that was — the Government sought to remedy that by writ of
mandamus and that — which was granted by the First Circuit
Court of Appeals and that action of the Court of Appeals was
reversed here.
