MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ARGUMENT OF JAMES van R. SPRINGER

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER CAMP

6

7

MR. SPRINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
These are two consolidated cases reviewing the same

8
9

Mr. Springer, you may pro­

decisions by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The

10

ultimate question presented is whether state bank authorities

11

can prevent a national bank from providing its customers with

12

an armored car messenger service to and from the bank if they

13

can do so on the theory that such a service amounts to the opera

14

tion of a branch governed by state law under the National Bank

15

Act. ,

16

Section 36(c) of that Act provides in general terms

17

that a national bank may establish a branch if a state bank

18

similarly situated would be authorized under state law to do so.

19

Florida where this case arises is a state that does not permit

20

branch banking at all, and it is further established for present

21

purposes at least that a Florida state bank would not be per­

22

mitted by the state authorities to operate the messenger service

23

here in question.

24
25

I might say parenthetically the reason why it is estab
lished for present purposes only is that the Court of Appeals

3

1

noted in its opinion that there is litigation pending in a

2

Florida State Court where this issue has been raised for the

3

first time that will resolve, presumably as a matter of state

4

interpretation, whether or not this kind of service is, in fact,

5

prohibited by the statutes.
However, subject to the outcome of that litigation,

S
7

the Florida Court has stayed until this Court decides this case

8

the Court of Appeals accepted the interpretation of the Florida

9

State Banicing Commissioner, who is one of the respondents here,

10

that the Florida statute would prohibit this kind of service

If

subject only to a retention of jurisdiction by the District

12

Court to change its order —Q

13
14

statutesand the issues has herewith repeated?
A

15
16

Yes, yes, that is correct, Mr. Justice,

I; was

just putting the cart before the horse.
It seemed a little strange to me that the Florida

17
18

Did you say this is not prohibited' by Florida

Court would stay itself, pending determination of this case, but
t

19

it in fact has done so.

In any event, nobody knows what will

20

happen to that litigation, and unless something does happen, the

21

Court of Appeals has, in effect, decided that this service cannot
f

22

23

proceed.
The issue therefore in this case is whether the kind

24

of messenger service sought here is a branch, that being, of

25

course, a term of origin of the National Bank Act.
4

If it is a

1

branch, then 36(c) of the National Bank Act makes its legality

2

depend upon state law and, as I have said, stata law for present

3

purposes forbids it.

*4

If it is not a branch, then its legality

depends only upon the provisions of the National Bank Act relat­

5

ing to the powers of national banks, which do not refer to

6

state law and are not in issue in this case.

7

' .

As w© see it, the definitional problem this case

8

presents really breaks down, into two questions.

The first ques­

9

tion is the threshold question of ’where we look for the criteria

to

to determine what is a branch.

■31

look to subsection (f) of the branching section of the National

12

Bank Act Section 36, which says that the term "branch," as used

13

in this section, shall be held to include any branch bank, brand,

14

office, branch agency, additional office or any place of business

15

at which deposits are received or checks paid or money lent.

36

We say that naturally one. would

The Court of Appeals says, however, that Section 36(f)

37

is hardly adequate as a definition.

18

Therefore, Florida should determine whether it is a branch l:or

19

purposes of incorporation of state law, which is provided for in

20

Section 36(c).

21

Those are the words used.

As I have indicated, if the Court of Appeals was right,

22

that ends the case.

23

further question whether the District Court properly held that

24

the armored car messenger.'service in question here was not

25

Here if we are right, there remains the

branch banking as a matter of purely Federal law under the
5

1

Section 36 definition which the District Court treated as its

2

exclusives definition»

3

was right, then Florida has nothing to do with the case»

4

And, of course, if the District Court

There are two petitioners here, the Comptroller of

5

the Currency, who has authorised the service in question, and

6

the First National Bank of Plant City, Florida, which was con-

7

ducting the service.

3

petitioner,

9

mentioned, the choice of law question which has importance not

10

only for this particular kind of service, but for a variety of

11

other services that national banks offer or may wish to offer.

12

There will be argument on behalf of each

1 plan to cover the first of the questions that I

Mr. Edwards, who will be arguing on behalf of the

13

bank, will deal primarily with the second question, which assumes

14

that of course that we prevail in the first question, the ques­

15

tion as to how the facts of this particular service relate to

IS

the Federal definition in Section 36(f) if that is, in fact, the

17

governing definition.

18

That question, of course, also has great importance

19

because there are a great number of national banks throughout

20

the country that provide services or are interested ir, providing

21

services of the general nature of the services that are involved

22

by Plant City.

23

Because of this division, I would hope to limit my

24

statement to a very brief statement of how the case arose and

25

the fundamental facts, leaving for Mr. Edwards a more detailed
6

1

description of tha messenger service that is involved in the

2

case.

3

Q

Will you keep your voice up a little please?

4

A

I am sorry.

5

In 'October 1966 consultation, with the Comptroller of

6

the Currency,, the Plant City National Bank began to operate its

7

messenger service.

8

primarily stores, in the outlying areas of Plant City, Florida,

9

which is a city of about 18,000 people some 20 miles inland

10

It was designed for the benefit of customers?

from Tampa.

11

The messenger service has two elements;

12

armored car which pursues a daily route between the hank’s

13

office and the customers’ places of business.

14

on that truck and he receives from the customers sealed bags

15

containing funds for deposit in the bank, which he then delivers

18

to the teller at the bank’s office, who opens the bags and then

17

treats the contents as deposits when they are received at the

18

bank.

19

order by the customers sealed bags that contain change or funds

20

for use in their businesses, which have been, withdrawn from the

2!

customers’ accounts before the truck leaves the bank.

22

First, an

A messenger rides

The messenger also delivers to the customers upon prior

The second element of the messenger service is a secure;

23

receptacle, which is literally a hole in the wall at a shopping

24

center with a drop-slot where the bags or envelops containing

25

funds for deposit in the bank can be left for pickup by the
7

1

messengers during the course of its daily rounds.
The armored car operation was designed to comply spe­

2
3

cifically with paragraph 7430 of the Comptroller's Manual for

4

National Banks, which is a compilation of pertinent regulations,

5

among other things.

6

subject to the condition that the customer understands the mes­

7

senger is his agent and not the bank's* and that any funds

8

received are not actually deposited until the teller at the bank

3

accepts them.
The bank also obtained with respect to the shopping

The paragraph authorises such an operation

center pickup point a specific ruling from the Comptroller's
office that that, was permissible subject generally to the same
conditions that I mentioned.

Underlying both rulings, of course,

was the determination by the Comptroller's office that such
operation subject to these conditions were sound and safe servic; s
authorized by the National Bank as incidence to the conduct of
a banking business, and that they did not amount to the opera­
tion of a branch as to which, of course, state laws would be
pertinent.
Just as the messenger service was about to begin its
operation the respondent Diclcinson, who is the Florida State
Banking Commissioner,, serf: a letter to the president of the bank

23

expressing the view that the services would violate Florida law

24

and threatening suit if-the bank did not cease and desist.

25

The bank promptly began this suit in -the District

8

1

Court seeking declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent

2

state interference with the operation.

3

Currency subsequently intervened as a plaintiff and the responde t

4

state bank her also intervened as defendants on the side of the

5

State Commissioner.

The Comptroller of the

At the outset of the litigation the District Court

8
7

entered a preliminary injunction allowing the messenger service

8

to continue and, in fact, that preliminary injunction has con­

9

tinued until now, so that the service has been proceeding.

Then

10

after exploration of the facts and affidavits and on reading

n

voluminous depositions that were taken in the case, the District

12

Court entered summary judgment in behalf of the National Bank

13

and the Comptroller.
Q

H

Would you mind stating precisely the nature of

15

the business at the alleged so-called branch bank — the messen­

16

ger bank?
A

17

As I indicated, Mr. Justice, 1 had hoped perhaps

18

that Mr. Edwards in his portion of the argument would describe

19

that more fully.
Q

20
21

I would know mors about the case if you would do

that.

22

A

Well, as I indicated ——

23

q

But, then if it bothers you, you wait.

24

A

It does not bother me, Mr. Justice Black.

25

try to outline the general language if operates under.

S

I did

1

Q

1 didn't get —--

2

A

It involves an armored car which picks up from

3

customers, generally business enterprises in the outlying areas

4

of Plant City, sealed canvas bags containing funds which they

5

wish to deposit at the main office of the bank in downtown Plant

6

City.

7

two officials at the .bank at the office, who then open the bag,

8

count the money, treat the money as if it were then deposited

9

at the point when it reaches the bank.
Q

10
11

It receives those, turns them over to a teller, actually

Do they go and pick it up at the individual

stores in the outlying areas?
A

The messenger on the armored car does do that,

24

Q

How far does he go?

25

A

Weil, a ---

16

Q

Does he go to any other villages or towns?

A

Mr. Edwards may correct me on that, but I believe

22

13

yes.

27
18
19

not.

I believe it is unincorporated, more or less rural areas

that surround the shopping center.

20

Q

But these are employees of the bank, are they not'

22

A

Yes, they are.

22

Q

And the truck is owned by the bank?

23

A

Yes, it is.

24

Q

They are controlled by the bank?

A

Yes, in the sense that --

25

10

1

2

Q

Their routing would be, their daily activities

are directed by the bank as a principal?
A

3

Yes, that is right, Mr. Chief Justice, though

4

of course there are contractual relationships, a specific con­

5

tract with each customer upon whom the truck calls, this con­

S

tract in which the customer states he understands the fact the

7

messenger* is his agent and not the bank's and that money is not

8

treated as a deposit until it is actually received, which of

9

course has substantial practical significance.
If the truck were robbed, the money would still be the

10

11

customer's money and not the bank’s money,

12

Q

But it is insured?

13

A

There is insurance, but it would not be deposited

14

until the customer, for example in the case of a robbery,

15

obtained recovery from the insurance company and then gave that

16

money to the bank.

17
13
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Q

Who provides the insurance?

A

The tank pays the insurance,

Q

Does the depositor pay anything for this service?

A

No, he does not, Mr. Marshall,

I understand —

though it is strictly not part of the record —■ it is contem­
plated that when the service shakes down, and I don't know
exactly when that would be, that some allocation of cost could
be made.

Perhaps a charge would be made.

there is now now charge to the customers.
11

But it is true that

1

As I indicated, the District Court agreed with what

2

is in substance our position here, that the determination of

3

whether of not this service amounts to a branch is one of

4
5
S
7

8
9
10
11

12
13

purely Federal lav? in the application of the definition as set
forth in the National Bank Act.

It further determined that this

service did not amount to a branch, that the Comptroller had
properly shown.

And, accordingly, this was allowed.

The Circuit reversed taking the approach that the
question whether or not this was a branch, therefore whether
Florida lav? would be incorporated and therefore whether Florida
law would be allov?ed to prohibit this service was a question of
state law, and that since Florida law, as the Court understood
it, regarded this activity as a branch, therefore Section 36 —
Q

What was the source of that Florida law?

A

The source of that Florida law as to what was a

14
15
branch was ultimately the Court of Appeals notion of the meaning
16
of the Florida statutes, which in fact says nothing about branch
17
ing or about branches in terms.

It simply says any bank and

18
19

trust company shall only have one place of doing business and

20

the business of the bank ot trust company shall be at its banking-

21

house and not elsewhere.

22
23
24
25

Q

There are no Florida decisions which would sup­

port the Court of Appeals interpretation of that?
A

That is true.

Q

Is that the issue now before the Florida—

12

1

A.

As X am saying, that is an issue which is now

2

in a court in Florida, which may of course work its way up throu :fh

3

the system.

4

The Court of Appeals did, as I indicated, note the

5

view of the Florida Banking Commissioner and, to be frank,

6

indicates that it thought that was a reasonable position, so it

7

was not and out and out relying simply upon the ruling of a

8

Florida official.

9

The Fifth Circuit's decision leaves what seems to us

10

an anomalous principle, one which is apparently stated in this

n

Court by respondents, but which is enthusiastically supported

12

by the amicus brief which has been filed in behalf of The

13

National Association of Supervisors of State Banks, who I under­

14

stand will be presently an argument and who represent all 50 of

15

m
17

the state's banking commissioners, including the one who is a
respondent here.
We believe that the principle followed by the Court of

18

Appeals is erroneous, but it is one that would be highly damag­

19

ing to the proper regulation of the National Bank Systems.

20

think that a straightforward reading, to begin with, of Section

21

36 of the National Bank Act makes it quite clear that Section 36

22

is designed to establish a uniform and exclusive definition of

23

what is a national bank branch.

24
25

We

The structure of Section 36 remains now very much as
it was when it was enacted in 1927 as Section 7 of the McFadden
13

1

Act for the first time allowed national banks to engage in brand:,

2

banking,, generally speaking, on the same terms as state, banks.
The introductory paragraph of Section 36 provides the

3
4

conditions upon which the National Banking Association may retain,

5

establish and operate a branch or branches are the following:

6

The word "branch" appears throughout the section,

7

notably in subsection (c) to which I have referred, which says

8

that a national banking association may, with the approval of

9

the Comptroller of the Currency, establish and operate new

JO

branches if such establishment and operation are at the time

11

expressly authorised to state banks by the state laws in questio::..

12

There are further refinements there.

13

Q

Mr. Springer, do you read the Court of Appeals

14

opinion as saying whether this is a branch under Federal law is

15

wholly irrelevant as a consideration?
A

16
17
18
19

I acknowledge that there is a certain amount of

not entirely clear language in the opinion.

I think that the

ultimate — that the Court's statement of what it was holding
and it is holdixig in fact can only be read as holding that if

20

state law regards it as a branch, it is therefore a branch for

21

purposes of Federal lav? and, therefore, substantive law of

22

branching is incorporated by Section 36(c).
Q

23
24
25

Irrespective of whether we are looking at it

simply in the four corners of the Federal law, it is a branch
of not?

14

A

1

In fact, the Court of Appeals says that the

2

Federal law is hardly adequate as a definite and, as we read it,

3

I see no — and as the State Supervisors read it, that in substa ,ce

4

does amount to saying that if state law calls it a branch, you

5

don't have to look at. a Federal law.
That seems to us a highly anomalous reading of a sub-

6
7

section of a. Federal statute which says that the term "branch"

8

as used in this section shall be held to include any branch bank t

9

office or agency at which deposits are received, checks paid,

10

or loans or money lent.
Congressman McFadden, who was the sponsor of the Act,

It
12

in his own analysis of the Act upon its passage, said that

13

subsection (f)

and 1 am quoting his language -- "defines the

14

term 'branch'."

"Anyplace outside of the main office where the

15

bank carries on its business, receiving deposits, paying checks,

16

lending money or transacting business at the main office is a

17

branch."

18

Of course, this question of what is a branch is rele­

19

vant for a variety of purposes other than than subsection (c)

20

to which we refer in our brief, including sections where there

21
22
23
24
25

is no semblance of any incorporation of state lav/.

It seems

unusual that Congress would expect that the definition of "brand:."
for these purposes would vary according to the state where the
particular national bank in question is located, and it seems
even more anomalous to treat, the word "branch" as having different

15

1

meanings in different subsections of the same section enacted

2

at the same time*

3

As we further detail in our brief, the Comptroller,

4

the Attorney General and, in this case, the Federal Courts have

5

all treated the question of whether or not a particular enter-

6

price is a branch as a question of Federal law unaffected by

7

local law.

8

when Congress uses a word, unless there is some reason to believe

9

otherwise, Congress intended that that word should be defined

10
'ii

12
13

This is consistent with the general principle that

and interpreted as a matter of Federal law.
A

Is it true that the state bank could not operate

this service?
A

Subject to what I said before, that is true;

14

subject to a possible decision to the contrary by the Florida

15

Courts where the question — for present purposes it is true.

16

17

Q

But as the law now stands, it is law that the

state bank could give its depositors this additional free servic< ;?

18

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, that is correct..

19

Q

But a national bank can't?

20

A

Yes.

21

Q

Isn't that contrary to the purpose of the Act?

22

A

It is argued, of course, that is contrary to a

Wa say -—-

23

supposed principle of competitive equality.

Of course, that

24

principle was articulated and followed by this Court in the

25

Walker Bank Case.

As to that, of course the Walker Bank Case
16

]

involved a situation where nobody questioned what was involved

2

was a branch and that there was an incorporation of state law.

3

The question there is, is all of the state law incorporated * as

4

the Court put it, or only some of it?
The Comptroller made a valiant uphill argument that

5

6

it was only the law relating to the. location that was incor­

7

porated and not the law relating to the manner in which a branch

8

can be established,.
This case, on the other hand, raises the question whet' i.QI

9
to

there is any incorporation of state law at all.

11

an incorporation only if there is a branch.

12

that the policy of competitive equality comes into play only

13

to the extent there is in the Act an incorporation of state

14

law.

15

throughout every provision of the National Bank Act and, of

16

course, there are a great many things national banks can do that

17

state banks cannot do and there are a great many things that

18

state banks can do that national. banks cannot do.

19

There is such

We would submit

It is not an all-pervading, absolute policy that runs

So that ws say that while competitive equality if a

20

great genuine principle, it is a principle that applies only in

21

the instances where Congress has specifically provided for a

22

reference to state law.

23
24
25

Q

Of course, you could win on the question of the

governing law and lose on whether this is a branch or not?
A

'Yes, that is certainly true, Mr. Justice White,
17

1

and 1 am relying on my colleague primarily to convince you of

2

that as a matter of Federal definition, this pickup and delivery

3

service does not amount to the conduct of a branch and more par­

4

ticularly, in the words of the statute, does not amount to the

£

receipt of deposits of the payment of checks.

6

The effect of the Court of Appeals notion of the all-

7

pervading applicability of the principle of competitive equality

8

is to delegate to the states broad control over perhaps any

9

off-premise activity by national banks.

All the state has to do

10

is to call it a branch, and by calling it a branch the state

H

can succeed in having its own substantive law which may permit

12

it or may prohibit it, incorporated purportedly through subsecti*, n

13

(c) of Section 36.

14

Q

Well, if the state did that, I suppose the Court

15

might be interested in v;hef.her the state may be doing something

16

of the same general character and not calling it a "branch,”

17

would they?

IS

A

Oh, it would certainly be determined, the State

19

Comptrollers would say, "Why should anybody be worried?3'

20

State Comptrollers can prohibit an act by'a national bank only

21

if they are also willing to prohibit it by a state bank.

22
23
24
25

Q

The

As you indicated, I think earlier, the state does

not permit this activity for a state bank?
A

Yes.

Of course, the effect of this is, first,

to move from the Federal Comptroller to the state officials * or

18

1

it least to the State Legislature a broad range of control over

2

:he incidental services that a national bank can perform off its

3

premises.

4

:ype, but a broad range of activities related to the lending of

5

toney, which is another issue of current importance.

This involves not only armored car services of this

Potentially it involves things like credit cards, for

i banking activity being carried on off the bank's premises, and

I suppose that this is getting under the phase

that your colleague in his argument is going to handle.

15

Of course, I am happy to answer.

Sir, as 1 have

16

indicated, we think that this does have broad significance, sorae

17

of which has been indicated by some detail by the Bank of Cor­

18

nelia and a group of other national banks throughout the country

19

as amicus curiae in this case.

20

In sum, we think this choice of law issue the District

21

Court, gave Section 36 a simple, strictforward and sensible read­

22

ing.

23

not only sensible, but the least complicated approach, which has

24

some virtue, that national banks can have branches where state

25

banks can have branches

The Act provides, according to that reading, which seems

but as befits a comprehensive scheme
20

1

of Federal regulation, the Act specifies the uniform nationwide

2

set of criteria for determining what is a branch and, therefore,

3

when we look to state law.

4

I might just say a word of introduction to Mr. Edwards 1

5

points that, of course, the Comptroller in promulgating the

6

rulings pursuant to which these activities are being carried on .

7

made a determination that these pickup and delivery services do

not amount to branch banking.

9

purposes, which involves involve its regulation of the banks

The Reserve Board for its own

50

that are members of the Federal Reserve System which are governed

by the same law, the same Federal law with respect to banking,

12

has actually the same determination.

13

We believe that those interpretations are, first, the

14

only reasonable ones that can be given of the Federal' statutes,

15

that is something we are treating the question as a matter of

if there is an area of reasonableness,that determination should

be set aside only if found to be unreasonable.

believe, first, that the question is before this Court is one of

Federal law and that the Federal lav; was properly interpreted

23

with respect to this situation.

concerns the District Court's choice of law.

7

National5s activity constitutes branch banking.

First of all, the Court starts off early in

Then it goes on to say, "First National attempted to

opinion, "We therefore refuse to tread the twisting paths of

20

And finally it said toward the end of its

21

language plus the result, we have to say that in effect the Cour

22

of Appeals has said that the language of 36(f) is superfluous.

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. EDWARDS

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERf THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK IN

4

PLANT CITY
MR. EDWARDS:

5

6

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I would like to begin, if 1 might, by addressing myseX

7

8

just generally to how we got into this situation.

I represent

9

the First National Bank in Plant City, who filed a suit for

10

declaratory relief in the Federal Disfc Court in the Northern

n

District of Florida.

Mr. Dickinson resides at Tallahassee.

We were faced with the situation of where we had gone

12
13

to -the Comptroller of the Currency, who is our supervisor and

14

our boss, as it were, and had cleared with him and having analysed

15

his regulations and rulings thst we could carry on this transaction

16

that we do now carry on.
We had prepared and begun to render this service when

17
18

we received a letter directed to us by the Assistant Deputy

19

Banking Commissioner of the State of Florida, simply telling us

20

to cease and desist, that our activities constituted branch bank­

21

ing under Section 65906 under the Florida law.

22

if we did not elect to cease and desist, that they would take

23

action as they had just recently filed against the Bank of Panama

24

City to require us to terminate this type of service that we were

25

rendering.
23

It indicated that

1

It was much later, as a matter of fact, after a favor­

2

able decision by the Federal District Court and the appeal was

3

well on to the Circuit of Appeals when the State Court was first

4

involved in this litigation by a bank in Tallahassee.

5

litigation arose much later in time and there was no state liti­

6

gation availablej, any state decisions that would guide anybody

7

at the time the Court made its decision in this.
I might, as a matter of passing, point out to

8
9

The state

you

that much later, even after the Circuit Court of Appeals had

10

entered its decision, there was a case of the Bergamon Financial

11

Corporation against Dickinson decided by the Supreme Court of

12

Florida, wherein the Supreme Court of Florida declined to deter­

13

mine that chapter 659 made the activities of a broker who was

14

soliciting and accepting deposits for transmittal to a savings

15

and loan association in the State of California as a banking

16

activity,

17

The Supreme Court at that instance said, “The receipt

18

of these monies by this broker to transmit to Ca3ifornia did not

19

constitute the acceptance of a deposit which would violate

20

chapter 659 of the banking law and, in essence make that broker

21

a banker.”

22

to us in the State of Florida.
There were no other decisions and there are no other

23
24
25

So that decision by the Supreme Court is available

decisions.

The subject court, which is the court of original

jurisdiction in Florida, elected to simply await the outcome of
24

\

this case since the activities had been begun on the basis of

2

the District Court's opinion or decision that it was lawful.
I need to speak to you also to the fact that we have

We hasten always —

Q

Are there any other banks there?

A

There is one other bank, a state-chartered bank

that has been in existence since 1905.
and one of the intervenors here.

It is the Hillsboro Bank

There are two other intervenors,

which are the Peoples Bank of Lakeland, which is 11 miles away
in the City of Lakeland, and the First State Bank of Ruskin,
which is approximately 25 miles south of us.

These three state

banks are intervenors in this Court.

23

Q

Intervenors and what deposition?

24

A

They are on the side of the State Banking Commis­

25

sioner.

They have actively carried on the litigation cn behalf
25

1

of the Banking Commissloner of Florida, resisting the decision

2

of the Federal District Court and sustaining or promoting the

3

decision of the Circuit Court, of Appeals.

4

The Hillsboro Bank has long been in existence, the

5

state bank in the City of Plant City.

We became a chartered

6

bank in 1957 and as such was the baby bank, the one that needed

7

to get out and to do thing in order to get deposits and in order

3

to be able to render a service to the community and thereby

9

grow.
We are the smaller bank of the two banks in the com­

10

11

munity.

12

a situation where our city, which had been long a very small

13

city, was beginning to develop and the first shopping center was

14

coming in.

15

We found ourselves in 1966 and actually in 1965 with

It was located approximately a mile from town.
We researched under the Federal rulings that were

16

available this idea of hot»/ we could render a service to this

17

shopping center approximately a mile from town.

18

that the locating of a drop very similar and, as a matter of

19

fact, identical to the night depository of the bank in that

20

shopping center would render a very great service to this area,

21

because we had these many stores that were confronted with the

22

problem of getting at the closing hour from that place to our

23
24

25

We determined

banking premises, hopefully, and possibly to the other banking
premises to deposit the collections of the day, carrying with, it
all the attendant problems that goes with transporting money
26

1
2

after dark and so forth.
When we were able to determine that the Comptroller of

3

the Currency thought that if we complied with these rulings,

4

that this drop would not go to and become within the definition

5

of a branch bank, we began this service,

6

service is now being rendered by several other banks in the

7

State of Florida,

And incidentally this

'

8

8

.1

This service is simply a place for people to bring
their night bags, drop them into the night depository so that

10

they will be picked up by our armored car messenger service and

11

admitted to the bank either that evening or the next morning,

12

thereby eliminating the problem that is very difficult for them.

13

Wow we also elected at the same time because the

14

Comptroller indicated that it could be done to sign, contracts

15

with various other business people in the area, which said that

16

we would agree to transmit their funds to the bank for deposit

17

as agent with the clear understanding on the basis of the con­

IS

tract that was signed that their deposits would become deposits

19

when they reached the bank’s teller and thereby we felt that we

20

had adequately met the test that the Federal definition set up.

21

22
23
24
23

Mien we examined Section 36(f), it was very clear to
say that branch banking would be considered and we would become
under the Florida regulations when we established a branch place
of business or another business office at which we elected to
accept deposits of paychecks or lend money.
27

We were very careful

!

not because of any subterfuge, but simply because we wanted to

2

stay vzithin the rules and render the service that was needed, to

3

[iave an understanding with our people as to what we were doing.

4

And I will submit to you that on the basis of that we

5

have a clear understanding with these people and that we cannot

6

go beyond that and will not go beyond that, and that this is a

7

very definite and clear place where you can draw the line, and

8

that this is what Congress intended to do..

8

Q

I would like to ask you a little more about the

10

factual setup, which I believe Mr. Justice Black was addressing

11

himself to a while ago.

They carry money both ways, do they?

12

A

Yes, we do.,

13

Q

Suppose a customer, who is a contractor, calls

14

the bank and says that he wanted $10,000 in small bills delivered

15

in a certain way and delivered to the job site where the con­

16

tractor was performing work in order to pay off his employees.

17

Would the First National carry out that instruction?

18

A

If he has on deposit in the First National Bank

19

$10 ,000 and has previously signed this contractual arrangement

20

with us whereby we have agreed to charge his account, then we

21

will charge his account, place this money in a sealed container,

22

outlining the monies that are in there, carry it to the person wb

23

has requested it, obtain a receipt from him whereby he acknow­

24

ledges that we have charged his account at the bank and deliver

25

those monies to him, yes.
28

!

Q

Would they put it in envelopes with names on it,

2

specifying amounts for each person, so that these envelopes

3

could be handed out to the employees on the job site?

4

A

We do that quite frequently for people who come

5

to our drivein window.

S

yes, we do that and place it within the bag and it can be picked

7

up at our drivein window at the bank.

8
9
10

Now I say that because I don't believe that we have
been asked to do that in our service if we have not been called
on.

n
22

If they ask that a payroll be made up,

The answer is that probably we would.
Q

How far, what would be the range of the territory

that you would make that delivery to the job site for the con-

13
14

A

15

of the situation would govern.

16

Well, there is no rule on it.

The practical

Our truck does go out

as far as 20 miles in one or two instances and in some other

17

instances, in all honesty, the trucks range much further than

18

that.

19

can go only so far.

20
21

22
23
24
25

There is no rule within the Federal System that says we

Q

But a state bank could not, or could it afford

that service?
A

Under the present circumstances in Florida it

could not, because it has been held by Comjrtrailer Dickinson
to be a matter of branch banking and they would not,allow that.
I think that would bring us well to this problem jof

29

1

competitive equality, which has been the overriding problem in

2

this situation all along.

3

And I would like to call to this Court’s attention ——

4

Q

Do you have any villages outside of Plant City?

5

A

Yes, some very small villages.

6

Q

What sisse?

7

A

One store or two storey a filling station and

9

Q

Do you have a bank in any of those other places?

10

A

No, sir, there is not.

8

a store.

However, I would want to

11

say to the Court that we have not set our rules to prohibit us

12

to go to another bank’s community.

13

legitimately do that as that bank, for instance, the Peoples Ban}

14

in Lakeland comes into our community in advertising and in lend­

15

ing money, so that we are constantly competitive with those othei

16

banks in the other communities.

Did you say you have a night depository at some

of these places?
A

We have a night depository ~~ we have a drop at

the shopping center that is the same thing as a night, depository.
It is the shopping center approximately a mile from our main bank
ing office,
Q

Is that the only one you have there?

A

It is the only one we have, yes, sir.

Q

The other places you just simply move in there
30

A

Our truck drives to their door.

Our messenger

carries it to the business house, which has previously contracted

with us for this service.

And you get the package from them, money which is

to be deposited?
A

That is correct, sir.

We pick up sealed bags

on which there is listed on the outside slip the money which is

9

contained therein.

This transmittal slip also has printed on

10

the back side the contract under which we operate, specifying

It is the

Q

Why do you insure it if it is not your money?

A

We insure it because it is a service to our cus­

tomers and we feel the customers would be at a loss without it.

21

the insuror to understand that there is a contract protecting

any other banking services.

A

Yes, sir.

I think we would definitely have ---

You don't have the big

it.

Well, to begin with, we have no people there.

It is simply a hole in the wall where you go and leave it.

simply picks up.

10

\

Ho, sir, the messenger does not stay there.

He goes there and —
Yes, he does.

But the point being if we could .

go back to the night depository, w~e have a clear understanding

13

by contract established by night depository law that when you

14

drop into the night depository at the bank, you have not made a

!5

deposit and we believe that this definition is very important

16

in defining the state versus the national situation, and that it

17

is a breaking point that is the proper breaking point.
If we did set up this building that you are talking and

18

19

render the services, it is clearly within the deposit window

20

situation that is anticipated by Congress.

21

are still without that when we have rendered the service on this

22

basis.

23

We believe that we

We would like to point out to the Court that there is

24

a very definite and clear reason for wanting to do this, because

25

it does render a service and constitutes a banking service rather
34

!

branch banking, which is prescribed by the Federal and state

2

laws.

3

Q

How would you characterize this as a branch or

4

not a branch;if the catch in your theory of the laws controlling

5

is the functional, rather the contractual activity of the bank

6

— the:functional activity of the bank rather than its con™

7

tractual relationships with the depositors?

i

8

h

Well, to begin with, I believe that when we start

9

dealing with deposit law or contract law and move over into the

10

functional definition rather than the strict contract law which

11

1 don't know what Mr, Springer's argument is, may

Respondents take this position, Mr, Justice Har­

We say that there are about four different views which

have been advanced here.

The first is that 36(f) is to be nar­

10

rowly construed without any reference whatsoever to the competi­

u

tive equality upon which the section clearly was placed in its

12

enactment.
We say that is wrong.

the District Court.

We made this argument before

It took that view.

But we say even in that

event, if that is the correct view, then we still should have
prevailed because the contractual arrangements are fictitious,
the Court should perform to substance.

There is no real agency

relationship and, accordingly, even by common law principle

19

agents of the bank are authorized to receive deposits and are

20

therefore receiving deposits off the premises.
The second argument is that we made an argument that

21

22
23
24
25

36(f) was exclusively Federal, it was a complete definition with­
out any reference to state lav;.

But it should be construed

broadly and liberally for the purpose of effectuating competitive
equality.

41

1

This view, incidentally, is the position which is

taken in a little pamphlet by the Legislative Reference Section

of the Library of Congress in evaluating certain of Mr. Saxon's

rulings, and it suggests a broad construction.

I would also point out that in 1927 at the time the McFadden
Act was being debated, that there were many people who argued
branch banking was a progressive service, but it offered service
and convenience to the customer.

And Congress decided, in

phrasing the McFadden Act as it did and taking the approach that
it did, that the question of service of convenience in this
area should be left for local determination.

any way by the local banking laws of Florida, in performing

precisely the same service as is performed here as an agent for

Yes, sir, I think that is possible, it could dc

that.

11
12

A

Well, I think we have to be careful with our

examples, Mr. Justice White.

But generally you would think that it. is possible

that the Florida lav; might prevent things that aren't banking?

And that a national bank could engage in those

practices because they aren't branches.

you first must apply 36(f).

11

A

That is correct, sir.

12

Q

And using the illustration you suggested yourself

13

of a travel agent, if out at this shopping center now this

In a regular bank if you go it in your car, you

can stand there in your car and give the money to the teller.

A

There is nohe, sir.

9

And at that, place that you refer there are receiving

10

deposits and therefore if they do it to the armored car, they

11

are likewise receiving deposits.
Now there is one point I would like to refer to before

12

13

it slips my mind.

14

that has happened in this operation is that money has been

delivered to customers and picked up and brought back.

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

This is

done routinely six days a week by the armored ‘car.
The armoBd car calls upon the depository twice every

17
18

The presentation has been made here that all

day.

At the depository it is not only night bags that are

placed into the depository, but also envelopes containing the
transmittal slip which is really just the regular deposit slip
with the conjured language on the back of it to try to make an
agency out of it.
And, and this is the most important point because it
should have resolved this case below and we should have never
been here, the District Court held that the matter of fact that
51

1

the First National was paying checks through this operation,

2

because it would actually deliver cash to a'customer and take a

3

check in return drawn on the bank.

4

That is paying checks.

That is a

ection 36 function.

5

The District Court strangely enough said it is not

going to approve that, but it will approve the rest of the opera­

tion, because fee First National is otherwise substantially com­
plying with the Comptroller of the Currency's rulings.

as amicus curiae for urg-

Now because both our position and the opinion of the
ourt below have been characterised in a manner by the petitioner^
ifch which we do not agree, I would like at the outset of my
rgument to pose the issue as we see it and its resolution by
he Court of Appeals below.
Now the petitioners argue that the determination of
hat are off-premise activities of a national bank amount to a
ranch is governed exclusively by 36(f) and they contend that all
hat is involved in a case of this type is a technical analysis
f the understanding between the bank and the customer in the
ighfc of applicable contract and commercial law to determine
hefcher there has been a deposit or check transaction placed in
he bank's business.
Nov; if there has been no transaction, there is no
>ranch and no reference to state law is required or permitted in
this analytical process.

Now under this reasoning the Comptrolle

of the Currency has recently ruled that national banks are not
23
60

1

ranching when they engage in check-cashing or the depositing

2

recess through off-premise shopping center depositories or

3
4

©bile facilities or when they they engage in the loan-making
recess through off-premise loan production.
Now if the result is a competitive disadvantage, the

3
6

itate banks who are prohibited such activity by branch policy

7

imbedded in state law, the petitioners assert that this is pre-

8

:isely what Congress intended.
Now the construction of Section 36{£} we support, which

9
10

11
12

13
U

15
16

,s the principal argument presented by the respondents and which
.s the one reflected in the decision of the Court of Appeals is
:his:

The Court of Appeals started with this Court's decision

.n the Walker Bank Case and there this Court had exhaustively
studied the legislative history of the branching provisions of
:he McFadden Act of 3.92? and the Banking Act of 1933 and reached
:he conclusion that the dominant intent of Congress was to estab­
lish competitive equality between national and state banks in

M

18
19
20
21

22

:he matter of branching based on state law.
And the Court then concluded that the only way to recon
:ile Section 36(f)» and Section 36(c), the branching section,
within the. framework of this congressional intent was to con­
sider Section 36(f) as a functional definition.
3ff-premise

If there is- an

facility at which activities are performed essential

23
to the loans, deposits or check-paying process, then reference

24
xiust be made to stat i banking policy in state law to determine

23
61

1

:hat the o££--premise facility would be a branch.

2

Now in other words,, the Court Of Appeals considered

3

Section 36 as a substantive definition of essential banking func

4

:ions, not as a technical delineation of the; party’s rights.

5

’he whole controversy in the McFadden Act of 1927, when both

6

Section 36(c) and (f) were adopted, and later in the Banking Act

7

>f 1933 revolved around the dispute between unit banking and

©

>ranch banking, and in the real world of banking the resolution

9

>f that dispute did not make a contractual relationship described

10

.n small print on a transmittal slip.

It is made by determinatiajn

«1

>f the extent to which banks can compete off-premises in the

12

functional essentials of banking —■ loans, deposits and checks.
Now that is what the Court of Appeals did and there is

to conflict or obscurity about it.

15

rou looked at it,, unless you want to throw away all the concepts

m

.n the business of banking, the off-premise activities in this

:ase inaugurated by the petitioners below involve the deposit-

18

ttaking process.

Q

Would you agree that Congress could authorise

.ational banks to do all the things that axe challenged herei*
A

Yesp Mr. Chief Justice.

There is no argument

hat the Congress of the United States could have given national
ianks this authority.

The question is one of statutory construc­

tion, did it?
Now 1 would like to turn, if I may, at this point to
(ome of the lines of argument advanced by the petitioners against
this position.
The first one, I think, frankly is directed to the
wrong form —* the Courts rather than to the Congress,
basically it is this:

But

Imaginative and vigorous national banks

13

are developing modern concepts of banking which would be frus­

14

trated under the ruling of the court below because it was sub­

15

ject national banks to unfriendly state legislation construed

IS by unfriendly state banking departments and result in a disparity
17
18

of treatment of national banks by the various states.
This line of argument

errs on at least six counts.

19 First, there is a disparity of treatment of national banks by
20

the various states and the matter of branching today.

Zl

permit unlimited branching, fifteen prohibit it altogether and

21

23

24

25

Twelve

the remaining twenty-three adopt a middle ground with widely
varying restrictions offering some of the benefits of banking,
but trying to protect small country banks, for example, by expan­
sion of city banks.

63

So diversity was specifically intended by Congress when

i

2.

it rejected the concept that branching should be determined by
Federal law.

So the very diversity that the petitioners; decry

4

that Congress wanted, because in every state

5

economies as well as divergent issues on the issue of branch

e versus unit banking.
7

there are differing

And Congress- sought to adopt that standard

as a measure of optimist of branching activities of that.

8

Second, with regard to this hypothecation of unfriendly

9

state legislation, the idea that a state is going to pass branch­

i

ing legislation that will hurt national banks when that legisla­
ti

tion is equally applicable to state banks, is simply unsupport-

22

able.

13

doing as opponents of unit banking is saying they don't like any

U

restrictions of branching.

15

has decided the state should decide.

16

And when petitioners make this decision, all they are

But that is a matter which Congress

Now somehow, third, the concept that imaginative

1? national banks are now trying to keep up with the times and are
18

being hurt is deserving of the same answer.

For what may be

10

imaginative expansion to some may spall a breakdown in unit bank­

20

ing and banking concentration to others.
Mr. Hansen has filed a brief for the Independent Banker 3

2!

22 Association making this pointly very strongly.
23

Now there are states which permit precisely the type

24 bf activity petitioners argue here.
25

'

California, for example.

But those states with a strong policy favoring unit banking,
64

1

such as Florida, do not.

2

of this issue.

3

the forum and national banks as well as state banks can go into

4

a state legislature anytime they want to to change the policy

5

sf their state.

6

And there are arguments on both sides

Congress has said state legislatures should be

Fourth, the concept that the decision below somehow or

1

Dther places national banks at the mercy of supervisors or,

8

indeed, as the Comptroller posed the question this morning, that

9

state bank supervisors can invent something, we believe is totallly

«0

unwarranted.
The source of state law is not supervisor imagination,

It
12

put the statutes of the state reflecting its branch banking

13

policy.

14

tively new today, so there are not many state judicial decisions

15

and as each instance' arises the question comes up, -is this in

16

accord with or contrary to branching policy of the state?

17

Wow this whole field of off“premise activity is rela­

In the absence of judicial decisions supervisors usuall

22

indeed, as has been pointed out here, the ruling of the Supervise

23

24
25

Wow each ruling is nondiscriminaEach

Now, fifth, the argument of the Comptroller that someiow the results

of the decision below is tantamount to supervisor

approval of Comptroller decisions is. equally without merit.

Of

course the Comptroller doesn't have to seek supervisor approval

5

to branching, sure that doesn’t mean that an iron curtain has to

descend between the Comptroller’s office'and the State Supervisor

I
Now also and finally, the petitioner aid their support- |

ing amicitie have compiled a fearsome list of activities which
they assert the State Supervisors can strike down under the decisior
of the court below on the guise that their branches are forbidden
under state law.
The functional definition of Section 36(f) does not
go to all banking activities.

It goes to the essential banking

activities -- the loans, deposits and checks.

And therefore any

20

such activities as signing a trust agreement in a law firm's

21

office and turning that law firm’s office into a branch clearly

22

wouldn’t even pass the functional definition.

23

Banking by mail, new business solicitation really

24

doesn’t have any off-premise additional office or facility.

25

what we are talking about here is the loan, check or deposit

66

So

i

functions of the type where there is a competition with other

2

banks for the public of the banking business,- because that is

3 what the preservation of the unit banking system in those states
4 that have adopted it depends upon.

When you go out and set up

S a facility such as the setup in this case and get a million dol­

s
7

lars of deposits in a week, it is a darned competitive facility.
And this is what the Congress was ta3.king about.

It

8 was talking about giving the states the right to determine whethe V9

or not you were going to have a unit or a branch banking system.

10

If you really follow the Comptroller's argument to its

11

ultimate decision, what he is saying is that anything that goes

'12

on in a banking office can go on anywhere else if you surround
it with a whole bunch of agency contracts and other types of

14

contractual relationships so that the ultimate responsibility or

15

the technical completion of the loans, checks or deposit process

16

doesn't place until you have gotten back to the main office.

17

And if a national bank can go into a shopping center and set up

18

a loan production office and right next-door is a depository,

19

desk, et cetera and right next to that a whole series of customer

20

where you can pick up checks and cash by mobile deposit, I ask

21

the question "Who needs a branch?"

22

Obviously, ——

of Section 36?

In my opinion they both involve essen­

tial elements relating to the deposit-making process,

Could you really call an armored car service that

12

A

It is a branch place of business with essential

activities relating to the deposit-making process, because I do

14

not see how you can construe Section 36(f) in any other way and

15

still reconcile it with the basic competitive quality intent

IS of Congress.

Do you think the president of the bank every now

I think that if you can go out and serve your

ustomers in a 20-mile area of the bank, to say that you are
perating solely within the framework of your main banking busiess is simply impossible within the framework of the branch
olicy definition.
Q

Well, what I'm trying to get at now is your
