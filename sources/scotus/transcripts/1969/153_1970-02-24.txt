The principal issue in these cases is whether or

These are three habeas corpus petition cases in which
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had ordered
evidentiary on the petition of state prisoners who are detained
by virtue of their pleas of guilty.
The District Courts which initially considered these
habeas petitions declined to order such hearings because the
primary allegation of each relator that a coerced confession
had been obtained from him was not a direct attack on the guilty
plea itself.
By its decisions in these cases the Second Circuit
has held that confessions which weren’t introduced against a
relator nevertheless can be attacked collaterally.

I will

address myself primarily to the nature of the pies, of guilty as
precluding a subsequent attack on the admissibility of

i

potential evidence»
Mr» Juviler of the Office of the District Attorney

2

of New York County will also discuss this issue»
In addition to claiming that a coerced confession

4
5

was used against him? each of the relators makes other allega-,

6

tions on which the Second Circuit has also ordered evidentiary

7

hearings and Mr* Juviler will discuss those allegations as

These three men were all convicted in New York State

Richardson satisfied two first degree murder charges

plea to murder in the first degree had been rejected on his
behalf *
Dash satisfied an indictment charging him with

the second degree after he personally rejected a. guilty plea to
the higher charge*

14

I think that it is more than relative and I

IS

think that this is one of the problems with the Second Circuit

decision, that they place absolutely no weight on the one

17

colloquy which they did have before them which was a model of

18

inquiry.

20

That's the Richardson?

A

That's the Richardson.

Q

Is that among these printed papers, or is that-

A

Yes; that's in the appendix at pages 88 through

It was a most thorough

inquiry

Don't stop; 1811 look at it.

4

1

Thank you»
A

2

No; I would like to follow up that thought for

3

a moment there , because I think that one of the problems in

4

these cases is that no matter how we look at these petitions

5

and at the Second Circuit decision, no colloquy, even the one

6

in Richardson, could ever satisfy the issue raised in these

7

cases.
After the judgments of conviction became final in

8
9

these cases each of these relators sought collateral relief in

10

New York by coram nobis, which is the post-conviction pro­

n

cedure in New York for testing claims which are not apparent

12

from the face cf the record»
Relief was denied in each case without hearing and

13
14
15
16

the denials were affirmed by the State Appellate Courts.

each relator sought Federal habeus corpus, claiming essentially

that he, after his arrest he gave a coerced confession.
After the District Courts had dismissed these peti­

17
18
19

tions the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered
evidentiary hearings in three separate opinions.
The Dash case was part of an en banc decision»

20
21

22
23
24
25

Then

Richardson was decided the same day and Williams about a month
later.

Basically, the majority opinion held in the second

Circuit that where a claim is made that evidence was illegally
obtained and where it is also maintained that the existence
and threatened use of that evidence at a trial substantially
5

1

motivated a plea of guilty, a petitioner is entitled to an

2

evidentiary hearing to test his claims? to test his claims that

3

his confession was coerced,that his plea was involuntary and

4

that his plea was substantially motivated by the allegedly

5

coerced confession, the whole range of allegations„

6

We think thafcin rendering these decisions the Court

7

of Appeal© has seriously misinterpreted the significance of the

8

plea.of guilty»

8
10

Q

into the voluntariness of the confession?

1!

A

52

Q

13
14

Well, does this contemplate also an inquiry

Yes; it does»
Without any state hearing in any state court

on that question?
A

The SEcond Circuit contemplates hearings

55

without there having been state hearings? that's right.

16

without, certainly, there having been pre-plea state hearings»

57

The question of whether or not the state would open up its

18

doors to these petitioners if this case were affirmed is

19

another issue, I think.

20
21

22
23.
24
25

Or

The convictions here, because they are based on pleas
of guilty, don't rest on any evidence.

Wo evidence was used

against these relators at a trial and this has occurred because
each relator, after consulting with counsel, decided to forego
a trial and all the contests of fact that that decision by
definition involves.

Each, instead, deliberately chose to have
6

1

their convictions rest fully on their pleas of guilty in open

2

court.
Q

3
4

Is it true that in each one of these cases

there was? in fact, a confession?

3

A

No.

6

Q

That's

just an allegation.

7

A

That's

just, an

allegation. We haven't

seen

8

any confessions,’ we don't know if they are written? we — I

9

believe each one may state that they are written; I am not

10
11

sure.
Q

Under the Court of Appeals' holding,

I guess

12

the counsel on the other side agrees that at any hearings it's

13

incumbent upon the petitioner to show that there was a con­

14

fession and that confession was coerced.

15

always within the power of the state to say there was no

16

confession.

17

A

If the state can verify this in any way —

18

Q

Well, it's not up to the state to verify it;

And I suppose it's

19

it's up to the petitioner to prove it; isn't it?

20

was one and that it was coerced.

21

A

That there

Well, as a practical matter, I don't know how,

22

beyond his own word a petitioner would establish that he made

23

a confession.

24
25

Q

Is there any way of knowing whether police

departments or district attorney's office and so on, keep the
/

1

files in cases which have long since been disposed of?

2

A

I don't know what the practice is with respect

3

to each county district attorney!, as to how long they keep

4

filed? and I don't know to the extent, for example,, the police­

5

man's memo book,, which may contain the only statement which

6

was ever made* would be preserved by the policemen or how long

7

is he able to read his notes or if they were ever turned over

Q

13

But* of course, that's not your problem; that’s

14

net the state’s problem; that's the petitioner's problem; isn't

15

it?
A

16

Well, it is the state's problem to the extent

17

that wehave to go hold hearings to get all records, to get

18

whatever witnesses are available»

19

thing»

20

Q

It's an extremely difficult

Well* to have hearings; yes, but this partic­

21

ular problem is the petitioner’s problem* because he has the

22

burden of proof»

23

A

Certainly he wouldhave the burden of proof,

24

but as a practical matter, it would turn back to the State,

25

because the state has whatever records there are, if there are

8

1

any.
Q

2
3

You think the mere assertion would be a

problem that the State would have to meet?

A

4

This is one of the questions that the Second

5

Circuit has not answered»

6

or other affidavits should be necessary, but they didn3t re™

7

quire in any of these cases and were already getting petitions

8

which makes very bare assertions on which hearings have been

these same circumstances in terms of times and criminal acts

14

and the petition alleged that he had been motivated in. making

15

his guilty plea by the knowledge that an eyewitness was avail­

16

able, but that this eyewitness was one whose testimony was

17

"tainted" because of improper lineups or eKhibitions of photo­

18

graphs, et cetera.

Suppose an allegation were made in

Would you read it as being within the scope of what the
Second Circuit has; now opened up?
A

I think it's entirely possible that it’s

within the scope of what the Second Circuit has opened up,
along with illegally-seised evidence.

They claim that evidence

was illegally seised along with almost any evidentiary claim
which can be made.
9

1

I have received a brief from the office of Respon­

a

dent's counsel, which alleges that he was coerced because of

3

unfair pretrial publicity and it rests directly on the allega­

4

tion — thw allegations are based directly on this case in the

5

Second Circuit,

©

of opening up of a plea, 1 think they are endless.

7

So, that it's ratifications for ether kinds

I think that thisis one of the reasons why once a

a

decision has been made, to rest a conviction on a plea of

9

guilty and to take whatever benefits flow from that plea and

10

after years have passed and the State has relied on this plea

13

in just the ways that we have described, that it should not be

12

the relator's option to repudiata the plea, because then there

13

is no meaning to the plea of guilty.

14

cedural step to the testing of evidentiary claims and it’s

15

significant that the independent basis of conviction is

18

completely negated.

n

Q

It only becomes a pro­

Do you understand it to be the view of the

13

Second Circuit that a plea substantially motivated by the

19

existence of an involuntary confession is an involuntary plea—

20

A

Yes „

21

Q

— or whether or not an involuntary plea, it’s

22

voidable, even though voluntary, if it was substantially

23

motivated by the involuntary confession.

24

25

That may be just a

am. not quite sure I understood the rationale of the Second
1G

1
2
3

Circuit.
A

Without meaning to be facetious, 1 have

problems with the rationale of the Second Circuit.

4

0

Well, that prompted my question.

5

A

I think it can be read that if a confession is

8

coerced and if that confession -- not the coercion of the

7

confession itself,, the existence of a confession, substantially

8

motivated the plea; that is, taking into account whatever

8

other evidence may have been available; taking into account

HO

the nature of the bargain that was struck; talcing into

11

account any variety of factors, the District Court now must

12

weigh this and call it "substantial motivation," and decide

13

how substantial it was.

14
15
16
17

And if it were substantial, and apparently if the
confessiones coerced, then the plea is to be set aside.
Q

Even though the plea itself was a voluntary

plea under the normal, conventional standards, was a voluntary

18

plea, i.e., knowing, intelligent, informed plea with the

19

advice of counsel, et cetera.

the Second Circuit — in the Second Circuit rationale»

What do you

Well, -that was ray question: doesn't there have

to be some nexus between the alleged coerced confession and
the plea?
A

No? because I don’t think substantial motiva­

tion means that.

I think all that substantial motivation

means is that there was a confession and for some reason it
was coerced, but I didn't test it, instead —
Q

I'm assuming the premise that it’s a coerced

confession.
A

All right.

I thought that the attack upon the plea de­

pended upon shotting that the plea was a consequence of the
coerced confession.

Not at all.

I agree that there is a differencet but I think there is

IS

substantial motivation or "but for/' may come down to the same

16

thing, but the answer is still: this plea was entered in lieu

17

of a trial.

18

Once the term "induced/1 or "substantially motivated/’ and all

19

of these terms predicated on, although all ignored the exist­

20

ence of a trial; they ignored the very nature of a guilty

21

There could havebeen a trial and there wasn't.

plea; they ignore the fact that no evidence is necessary to

22

support the conviction; that the plea is the independent basis

23

and thatonce you use words like "substantially motivated," or

24

"induced/’ to reach out to the evidentiary test you have

25

negated the plea of guilty.

You simply say: first you plead
13

1

guilty and then we’ll have this evidentiary hearing,, when you

2

demand it, at your request; many years later, perhaps, And you

3

have undermined the plea of guilty for which there are

4

certainly very great justifications,

A

Yes; we do, Your Honor,

Q

And you say that it makes no difference that

I take it then that you disagree with the

the defendant alleges and makes a specific allegation of the
incompetence of counsel in advising him about how to pleiad?
A

11

I think that the allegation that counsel is

12

ineffective, is certainly a ground on which collateral attack

13

against a plea of guilty can be based,

14

not argue to the contrary — but —
Q

15

I would never — would

In fact,

Then what would you say; that the plea was not

intelligently made; would you?

I mean, you were operating on a

false premise.
A

That's right.

Q

And you have set the guilty plea aside?

A

That's right, but where we have a claim of

coercion and an available procedure and this is essentially
what we are talking about in these cases, then we have —Q

With a guilty plea how can you ever get

to learn if the confession is coerced or not?
A
Q

You can't, except where you have —
So, if there is a coerced confession and for

some reason the lawyer and the defendant, both say there is no
use taking a chance; that's it.

Nobody can ever look into it?

A

That's right; that's what the plea of guilty ~

Q

But if there is a coerced confession and a

Denno hearing

Q

The difference being that once you go to trial

and test a confession the confession becomes a part of the

So that if the police officers identify the man

and they know they are wrong and if they beat a confession out
of him — I'm not even assuming it’s this case — and yet the
lawyer tells him, "Look, they are going to believe that police
officer and they are not going to believe you."

And he pleads

guilty? that's it?
A

16
17

It is evidence which

That's right.

That is because there is no

more point to testing a confession after a plea of guilty than
there is at a trial.

The same issues of credibility still

exist.
Q

But suppose at this hearing that the Second

Circuit has ordered it's found that there were no confessions.
The conviction stands?
A

That’s right.

Q

If the court finds that there were confessions,

they were perfectly legal; the conviction stands.

If they find

the confession is extorted by force and violence or what have

to suppress any

2

so moved, is it your suggestion that they have permanently

3

waived it?

4

A

That3s true, but this is not the ease of these

5

three relators who all pleaded guilty before the decision of

6

this court in Jackson against Denno.

7

Now, the Second Circuit felt it was compelled by the

8

decision in Jackson against Denno to hold that New York did not

S

provide these relators with a reasonable opportunity to test

10

11

their claims of coereien.
Q

And Judge Kaufman, if I understand his pro

12

curiam opinion, thought that these decisions were limited to

13

pre-Jackson ?. Denno situations?

14

A

That's right.

He felt that another issue on

15

the Second Circuit opinion as to whether that concurrence by

16

Judge Kaufman in which other members of the court concurred, is

1?

truly the limiting point.

18
10

20

Q

But, at least his view was that these decisions

were so limited to pre-Jackson-Denno cases?
A

If — that's correct? and if that's true, then

21

the Second Circuit decision is, in a sense, more limited than

22

many other decisions from the other circuits which never take

23

account at all of the possibility of going to trial.

24

neverrsgard it as an alternative, and yet it would seemthat the

25

They

right to go to trial is really what is at issue in these cases.
19

Now, as I said briefly before, before the Jackson

1
2

decision the problem in Jackson was that the same jury passed

3

on the question of guilt or innocence and on the question of

4

the voluntariness of the confession? and that procedure was

5

upheld by this Court in 1953 in Stein against New York»
Since the Jackson applied to cases which had already

6
7

been triad 'prior to June 22, 1964, the Second Circuit con­

8

cludes that it applied also to cases in which there was no

9

trial prior to 1964»
But clearly, Jackson does not apply where there never

10
11

was ajury trial»

12

already been tried before 1964 is that a confession that the

13

jury had already heard might have been coerced ant

based on a coerced confession»

case.

19

The problem arising from a case that had

therefore,

And so now we have to hold

But as we said here, the convictions are not based on

The Second Circuit also found that these relators

20

couldn’t be deemed to have entered voluntary pleas of guilty if

21

their pleas were substantially motivated by coerced confessions

22

the validity of which, for practical purposes, they were unable

23

to contest»

24
25

But, for this assertion to have any meaning, it would
have to be alleged factually that the pre-Jackson procedure in
20

?

some way actually motivated the plea of guilty and counsel's

2

advice to a plea of guilty.

3

In other words, the Stein procedure, as a matter of

4

law, is so bad that it even prompted pleas of guilty, innocent

men could plead guilty,

DISTRICT ATTORNEY, AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT
OF PETITIONERS

5
MR. JUVILER:

6

Hr, Chief Justice and may it please

7

the Court:

As Miss Soloff has pointed off, the applicability

8

of Jackson against Denno retroactive to cases that had already

9

been tried in which confessions were actually introduced to the

10

jury, suggests not one way that the Jackson case is applicable

n

where the conviction rests upon a plea of guilty.
A plea of guilty has many consequences, one of which

12

13

is to forego the benefit of any subsequently announced pro­

14

cedural right affecting a trial.

15

on one of the questions from the bench, if a defendant pleaded

16

guilty prior to the Bruton decision he may not now come forward

17

and say that he was induced to plead because he expected that

18

his co-defendant's confession would be introduced and the jury

19

would hear it and that would prejudice him.

You don't understand the so-called "omnibus"

Yes,

New York is that issue preserved on appeal after a plea of

Q

I see; 1 see.

And the logical outcome, perhaps, of the

Second Circuit opinion read in its broadest sense,, it to

acquire the New York procedure as a matter of constitutional

is the relator's arguments is that if evidence is obtained by
the police in an illegal manner, there reallyis no way that
a contested hearing on issues of fact can be avoided, even if
the defendant pleads guilty»
Here we have merely allegations of coercion of the
confessions, unsupported by anything outside of the petitioner’s
own, motions, but even assuming the truth of these allegations,
there is no connection; there is no nexus in a constitutional
sense between this alleged coercion and the plea of guilty, so
long as the defendant has a reasonable opportunity prior to
the entry of judgment to raise these constitutional claims and
indeed, the expansion of the list of these claims as to the
admissibility of evidence, requires that we maintain the timehonored, orderly procedures for presenting these claims,
whether they involve confessions or tangible evidence or eye­
witness identification»
24

1

There is no suggestion of a nexus in the allegation

Well, I suppose that if they were admittedly

or clearly coerced confessions that counsel wouldhave advised

had a procedure by which they could keep this confession out

be binding.

That is what a plea of guilty is all about.
What do you mean by a nexus, Mr. Juviler; a

Q

Doesn't it mean a connection?

5

A

It could mean a factual connection.

6

Q

Well, what does it mean to you?

7

A

I think it means a factual connection? it means

8

a continuation of ‘the coercion that was addressed in the

&

stationhouse to the defendant? a continuation of that coercion

10

11

into the courtroom and that is not alleged in these cases.
And, as long as there is nothing other than that to

12

take out of this case the dispositive fact that these defen­

13

dants had attorneys who, with the relators, made a choice to

14

forego their constitutional channels, as long as there is

15

nothing to remove that, then the plea of guilty should mean

16

what it says; "I am guilty."

17

You don’t have to prove it.

Wow, it seems apparent from the decisions in the

18

State and. in, I would say, all of the circuits, that this is

19

assumed to be the case with search and seizure claims, where

20

there is an attack, post-conviction proceedings on the ad­

21

22
23
24
25

missibility of tangible evidence, after a plea of guilty and I
don't see why there should be any difference when we come to
the confession claim, other than the perhaps emotionallysignificant fact that both the plea of guilty and the confession
are oral? but if there is a break in the chain of events between
27

1

the stationhouse interrogation and the plea of guilty, as there

2

is in each one of these cases, then that fact that these are

3

both oral is completely immaterial.

4

act of free will exercised by these defendants when they de­

5

cided to forego their trial.

when they allegedly confessed in the stationhouse,

the police and subsequently, while in custody, he makes
another confession, that second confession may be admissible
at a trial, even though, in a sense, the cat is out of the bag,
if the facts establish that there was a break in the chain of
events.

24
25

And that the second confession was voluntary and

came after the defendant was aware of his rights, where in our
case, the confession — the cat is not out of the bag at all,
because the defendant, aided by counsel, still armed with the
power to try to keep that cat in the bag, he says that "It's
not worth my trying," for various reasons, and so long as the
State or the Federal Government does not unnecessarily dis­
courage the opportunity of the defendant to challenge these
pieces tof evidence, then his decision not to do so shbikld be
binding.

22
23

The cat was not out of the bag

Q

that the Second Circuit proposes: yes or no?

I think that the first obligation is to allege

it before such a hearing should be ordered. We cannot just

7

presume it,

8

Justice, to presume that, because I think in common sense, as

9

Judge Friendly pointed out in his dissent:

5

A

I think, indeed, it would be unreasonable, Mr,

"There is no reason

10

to believe it"s purely speculative to say that this difference

11

between the Stein procedure, pre-Jackson procedure and the

12

post-Jackson procedure compelled this defendant or unnecessariT;

13

encouraged him to forego a trial,

U
15
16

Q

Didn’t Judge Kaufman slow you down a little on

A

He tired and he prevailed in the Second Cir­

that?

17

cuit, but I think, with all respect to the opinion of Judge

18

Kaufman, it is not persuasive and it does not overcome the

1®

fact that there was no factual allegation? it just doesn't

20

overcome the dissent,of Judge Friendly,

21

Now, the relators here in this Court, the way their

22

brief is written, urge on the Court this f«actual connection,

23

this actual faetucil motivation entering into the minds of

24

counsel that they sat down with their defendants and. they said,

25

"Well, the Stein procedure is not fair; we just can't get a
29

fair shake."

But I do not see that in the petitions them­

2

selves , and even if they were in the petitions, because all

3

they have in the petitions is citations to Jackson against

4

Denno, except for Richardson, who doesn't even make this claim,

5

so in his case it's not before the Court.

6

But if they were, a resourceful defendant were to

7

listen to my argument and to come back into a Federal Court

8

with these factual allegations, I would say again, these are

9

immaterial, because these convictions were based upon pleas of

10

guilty, not upon evidence, and when these defendants pleaded

11

guilty it was understood by everyone in the courtroom, in­

12

cluding every member of this Court that the New York procedure

13

was not fundamentally unfair.
Now, the problem is raise, well perhaps an innocent

14
15

man might be coerced into a plea by some improperly obtained

16

evidence, and we can't tolerate having people in prison under

17

those circumstances,

18

themselves in testifying at a preliminary stage of the case.

19

And, faced with that the defendant had no choice but to plead

20

guiIty.

21

Perhaps the police deliberately perjured

Now, I would say that under those circumstances where

22

we would have merely allegations, those are the reasons we

23

have trials, and either we maintain the practice of accepting

24

pleas of guilty or we have trials in every case.

A

25

risk of an innocent man —
30

If there is a

1

5

Q

Did I understand you to say that if it was

perjured testimony?
A

Yes»

I think it was Your Honor who asked or

suggested that -—
Q

Welly you say if there we re perjured testimony

6

by a police officer and as a result of that,, and for no other

7

reason the man said.» "I can't take a chance," that he is still

8

convicted and there is no way to reach him?

9
ie

Certainly you don't, have to go that far»
A

Then X think that the plea should be vacated»

ii

But, I'm talking about a case where the man admits his guilt

12

and he pleads guilty because after consulting with his counsel

13

he comes to the conclusion that he is guilty? he will admit it

14

in court? his conviction will be based on that plea and it's

15

just isn't worth a contest and that brings us to the other

16

allegations in these petitions.

17

First

,

that of Mr» Richardson, because he attempts, .

18

in a way, to get. under this rubric and say that his attorney

19

just completely failed to protect him against the \ise of a

20

coerced confession.

21

22
23
24
25

When Mr» Richardson pleaded guilty the colloquy pre­
cluded the dangers suggested in your question, Mr. Justice
Marshall, as reflected at pages 90 and 91 of the appendix.
The Court inquired of Mr. Richardson:

"Did you dis­

cuss this case fully with Mr. McCoe and Mr. Rosner?"

31

Those

1

were his assigned counsel»

2

"Yes, sir? I did»"

3

"Did y>u understand them when you spoke fco them about

4

your case?"

5

"Yes, sir»”

6

The Court then established that there were no threats

7

made to induce the plea and no promises from a long list of

8

public officials.

9

Now, the Court inquires? "Did you commit this crime?"

10

"Yes, sir."

11

"Now, did you, on or about March 24, 1963, in the

12

County of New York, willfully and feloniously, strike Rosalyn

13

Smith with a knife, thereby causing her death?"

14

"Yes, sir."

15

IF we

have

a danger

of innocent men pleading guilty,

16

then the way to attack that is in the colloquy of pleadings,

17

to protect the pleading procedure, as has been suggested in the

18

Boykin case by this Court and inthe McCarthy case, interpreting

19

Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,

20

neither of those cases is there one whit of a suggestion that

B\

this colloquy, this protection of the defendant, must include

22

any inquiry whatsoever from the court as to the admissibility

23

of evidence.

24
25

But, in

With respect to the other allegations in these peti­
tions, which include ineffective assistance of counsel and
32

1

a judicial threat to induce a plea»

2

Our basic position is that the Court of Appeals

3

deprived the District Court of a sound discretion when it

4

overruled the denial of these allegations without a hearing.
And if there is to be no finality in criminal cases,

5
6

no end to litigation after a conviction, then there should be

7

no end to the sound discretion of the District Courts, who are

8

on the front lines, and their colleagues in the state courts,

9

reviewing post-conviction claims for relief.
It is established that if a claim in post-conviction

10

IS

proceedings, Is vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible, then

'12

it can be denied without a hearing,and that is overlooked by

13

the Court of Appeals in these three cases.
Without dwelling at too great length on the specific

14
15

facts, Mr. Richardson, who claims ineffective assistance in

IS

counsel, in objecting to this coerced confession, in his

n

petition in the District Court merely made conclusory allega­

18

tions at pages A-78 and A-82 and surely there is nothing stated

19

there which overcomes the colloquy which I read tc Your Honors.
The Court of Appeals did not say otherwise? they

A

Yes? that5s why, as 1 was about to say, even

2

if the allegations in the supplementary affidavit were true,

3

and not that they present the picture of an outstanding member

4

of the Bar, but if they are true, they still do not state a

5

claim for Federal relief, because they do not show that this

6

man was completely without the effective assistance of counsel.

7

And the length of deliberations and consultations with his

e

counsel, which are alleged to be too short, are not the test

9

of the effective representation»

10

Not only that, but the supplementary affidavit is

21

contradicted by the letter? it is contradicted by the pleading

12

minutes and there is no explanation, why Mr, Richardson, after

13

allegedly having been told by his attorney that he could con­

14

test his confession by a writ of habeus corpus, waited for a

15

minimum of two-and-a-hhlf years before attempting to do so in

16

the Federal Courts.

17

Mr. Dash was granted an evidentiary heairing by the

18

Second Circuit on an allegation that when he appeared in court

19

for pleadings the judge threatened him, off the record,

with the maximum sentence if he went to trial and was convicted

in New York City for a hearing — for relief,

You say there was a split decision on that?

And Mr. —

Is the claim made here that the confession

Yes.

So, it therefore would not — the claim is that

it was not only a coerced confession, but also one that is

inadmissible because it violates the New York rules that

antedated the Messiah case?

IS

A

Yes; but the New York rule was not applied, I

20

don’t think at this time it was applied retroactively, and to

21

my knowledge, the Messiah case has not been either, so that

22

I don’t think that would give Mr. Dash his relief.

But, in any event, it’s academic; he pleaded guilty.

The Williams petition was held sufficient for a hear­

3

Williams' assigned counsel was disbarred for overzealousness in

a divorce case.

It's introduced by

Hows when that disbarment was published, this claim

6

was raised in the state court and - then in the Federal Court

7

that Mr. Davison had, just prior to theplaa, so advised the

8

relator that the charge to which the D.A. was allowing the

9

plea was a misdemeanor, not a felony? and that relator did not

10
11

discover the fact until sentenced on the felony.
Now, he was sentenced to 7-1/2 to 15 years for

12

robbery in the second degree.

13

he would, knowing at sentencing, discovering then that this was

14

not a misdemeanor, wait for six years before informing us as to

this advice from counsel, particularly a man who was no strange

ORAL ARGUMENT BY GRETCHEN WHITE 0BERMAN, ESQ.

?B

COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS

1©

MRS. OBERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20

the Court:

21

address myself to, because I feel that there has been either

22

misstatement or confusion about, first of all, the facts in the

23

case, and secondly, just precisely what the court below did do

24

in each of these cases and what it did not do.

25

There are two primary things that I would like to

First arid foremost, I think that it is clear the
39

1

Second Circuit did not announce a new rule of law in any of

2

these cases»

3

oc its own cases: United States ex pel. Glenn v. McMann.

4

this was a very long overdue step, because the Glenn decision

5

was at odds with decisions in this Court, as well as with the

6

decisions in the Courts of Appeals of at least five other

7

circuits„

10

11
12

decision acknowledged that under certain circumstances the
existence of a coerced confession could coerce a guilty plea.
The surprising thing about this recognition is that it came so
late.
But, it cannot be stressed enough that the Second

13
14

15
16
17

?S

Circuit c-id nor hold that the bare allegation that a confession
was coerced entitles a habeus petitioner either to a hearing or
to relief.

21

22
23
24
25

A certain specified cause and effect relationship

has 5.0 be alleged and has to be proved.

And the cause and.

effect relationship varies xn each one of these cases.
In the Richardson case and to an extent, in the

19

20

How»

Secondly, the court below, in limiting this Glenn

8
9

It merely reinterpreted and severely limited one

Williams case, the reason that the defendant was prevented from
raising his confession claims at trial was because he was
represented by counsel who was incompetent or negligent and
refused to lift a finger to help him, according to the allega­
tions.

Now, we're on the pleadings here and this is not a

question of what has been proved.

40

These are uncontroverted

1

2

allegations.
In the Dash case the cause and effect relationship

3

between the coerced confession and the guilty plea was that

4

counsel was unable to do anything meaningful to prevent the

5

coerced confession from being used to convict the defendant at

6

trial and the reason for this was Jackson against Denno, or

7

Stein against New York, I should say»

8
9

The third thing that I wouldlike to point out is that
the decisions below do not automatically call into question

10

the validity of all guilty pleas, no matter how painstaking and

11

how complete the colloquy at pleading has been or despite the

12

fact the defendant has been represented by counsel»

1.3

Second Circuit merely held, as I think virtually every other

14

court in the country, that in certain instances where you have

15

off-the-record or allegations of off-the-record facts in a

16

petition, even a full colloquy of pleading and even represen­

17

tation by counsel do not create an irrebutable presumption of

?8

voluntariness of the plea»

19

The

Moreover, the Second Circuit recognized that both

20

these factors, the completeness of the colloquy and represen­

21

tation by counsel are entitled to great weight in the ultimate

22

assessment of the voluntariness of the plea.

23

connection it should be noted thatthe Circuit held that both

24

the burden of pleading, that is the burden of going forward to

25

make a showing to get a hearing and the burden of proof at the
41

And in this

1

hearing of each and every allegation in the petition, not upon

2

the habeus petition,

3

Now, it must also be stressed that each of these

4

cases came up for review on the pleadings and the issue for

5

decision in each case was whether the facts alleged in each

6

petition stated claims which had proved at a hearing, either

7

in State of Federal Court would entitled petitioners to relief

under the 14th Amendment.

25

And the Second Circuit:gave New

cause the matter was remitted to the District Court and the
District Court was fcohold a hearing only if New York did not
hold a hearing.
In each case the Circuit has held that if the
allegations v/ere proved at a hearing the pleas in each case
were involuntary and for this reason a hearing had to be held.
It should be noted here that the State’s position in all of
these cases where they took a position, because at least in one
case no response was filed in the District Court, was that the
allegations even if proved at a hearing would not entitle the
respondents to relief.
Q

As I understand the Court of Appeals * opinions,

if it were merely alleged by a petitioner that a confession
was coerced from him and that that coercement and that confes­
sion motivated his plea because he thought it would be usable
against him, and that therefore, his guilty plea was coerced;
42

1

if those were the allegations, as I understand the Court of

2

Appeals8 opinions, there — he would be entitled to a hearing»

3

Let!s put aside — I know there are other allegations

4

in these cases»

5

weren't any allegations of incompetency in counsel, as long as

6

they alleged there was a coerced confession and that coerced

7

confession motivated or caused his plea and without the con­

8

fession he never would have pleaded guilty; as long as he

9

alleges that he can get a hearing?

10

A

But, as 1 read their opinions, even if there

Yes? I would have to amplify that just to a

n

certain extent»

The Circuit in its burden of proving, put upon

\z

the petitioner the obligation to come forward with whatever

13

affidavits —

14

Q

He would have to prove his case»

15

A

No, no; in order to get the hearing, so that

16
17

the bare allegations as you have outlined
Q

Sure»

Well, assuming he makes detailed allega­

18

tions as to why he thinks the confession was involuntary and

19

assume he says the state had no other evidence, no substantial

20

evidence but the confession?

21

22
23
24
25

A

Well, he mads a powerful showing — I think

that's the only way I can express it, that his confession was
coerced and that the confession, for reasons specified, was
the factor which induced his plea of guilty.
Q

That’s all he has to allege?
43

1

A

Yes.

2

Q

And then in Richardson you have the additional

3

factor of allegations of incompetency of counsel; don't you,,

4

in connection with advising the plea?

5

A

In Richardson you have the factor of the in-

6

competency of counsel which, 1 think, comes to hear in two

7

places: that it is an independent ground or claim for relief,

8

beyond the coerced confession claim, and vis-a-vis the coerced

9

confession claim, counsel’s failure to investigate and coun­

io

sel's wrong advice, and it was clearly wrong, under New York

n

law and under Federal Law at that time, about the time for

12

raising the confession, was the reason, the nexus, the causal

13

connection —

14

Q

Well, if you win, his advice was right.

15

A

Well, that's a fortuitous circumstance that I

16

17

don't think should have anything to do with the decision here.
Q

But, I take it that on my previous question {hat

18

you just alleges a coerced confession and that caused his plea,

1©

he gets a hearing even though he clearly conceded that his

20

counsel was competent?

21

22

A

Well, I'm afraid I have todivide that question

into two parts and then answer each one.

23

I think that before the decision in Jackson against.

24

Denno, if there is no challenge to the competence of counsel,

25

that *— but there is the allegation that the reason that the
44

1

confession issue was not raised at trial was because of the

2

Stein procedure and all of the chilling effects that that

3

procedure had upon — the distorting effects that that pro­

4

cedure had upon the fact-finding process and the guilt deter­

5

mination .

S

The fact that the defendant was represented by

7

competent counsel, under the point of view that the Circuit

8

Court took, doesn't preclude him from a hearing.

9

Jackson against Denno you have a different kind of problem.

Now, after
As

10

Mr. Juviler has pointed out, in New York, anyway, you have the

11

full hearing on voluntary confession that's held prior to trial

12

at that point the defendant has the option of ~

13

Q

Suppose he takes advantage of it?

Yes.

And after Jackson against Dennc

could deter a defendant from going to trial or ™

confession and the plea.

23

decision, which was not an en banc decision? and a separate

24

decision in which one of the dissenters in the en banc wrote the

25

majority, the connecting factor between the coerced confession
45

1

and the inability to raise the confession issue at trial was

2

the allegation of incompetency of counsel and counsel5s —

3
4

Q

Exactly,.

That was the factor in the

Richardson case.

5

A

Yes, but in Dash it was pointed out by the

6

Second Circuit that there was no allegation of incompetent

7

representation by counsel, so then the next question was:

8

"Well, if you have a claim that you consider a valid claim? if

9

you feel that your confession was coerced and you had competent

10

counsel to represent you at trial? you had a champion, why

II

didn't you present that claim at trial?

12

present it at trial

13

there has been a waiver, because you have failed to present the

14

claim in an acceptable state procedure."

And if you didn't

can we say that under those circumstances

The answer to that v;as Stein against New York, that

15
16

even competent counsel, before the decision in Jackson against

17

Denno, would think long and think hard about taking his

!8

defendant to trial with a coerced confession claim,under that

19

procedure, and I cannot stress enough the detrimental effect,

20

the coercive effect that that procedure had, both to counsel

21

and to a defendant confronted with a coerced confession claim

22

and the possibility of trial or plea.
Q

23

Mrs. Oberman, may I ask:

If this heaxing goes

24

forward — this is in the Dash case, and not the Richardson

25

case

Dash is where there is no allegation of incompetent
46

1

counsel, and it is established by Dash that, indeed, the con­

2

fession was beaten out. of him, then are you suggesting that any

3

advice of counsel — because he was represented by counsel —

4

then becomes irrelevant to his right to relief?

5

A

No* Your Honor; I am not.

6

Q

Well, what is the relevancy, of advice of

A

I think the Circuit viewed it in terms of

7

counsel?

8
9

prime mdtivative factor, other circuits' have talked about —
Q

10

Well, excuse me, but let .me make a. concrete

11

hypothetical.

Suppose, in fact,what counsel did was to say,

12

"Now, you say this was beaten out of you and you have some

13

corroborating proof that it was beaten out of you, but there

U

ware two police officers involved and there is going to be a

15

question of credibility, because thoseofficers are going to

16

deny that they beat it out of you and your witnesses are going

17

to say they did, and there is always the chance that, being a

18

fact question, that the issue of credibility will be resolved i i

19

in favor of the officers' story.
"Therefore, I suggest to you that if that should

20
21

happen you may go to the electric chair, and the better thing

22

for you to do under the circumstances, then is to plead guilty,

2.3

if we can get a second degree plea."
Suppose those were the facts as to the advice of

24
25

counsel—

47

‘5

A

Yes,

Taking your hypothetical strictly on its

2

facts, I think the Circuit has answered the question in its

3

opinion, by saying, "even there the confession is coerced,"

4

defense counsel may properly advise the defendant, to plead

5

guilty, say if there is substantial evidence, or if the possi­

6

bility of proving a claim is minimal, because of the caliber of

7

the witnesses and so on —

8

Q

But is that quite the question 1 put to you?

9

A

Well, perhaps I —

10

Q

Well, what I'm trying to get at new is the

A

11

reasons you told me initially, a hearing on the — on whether

12

or not the confession was coerced, and it. is decided, factually,

13

and the officers testify and -- I am speaking now of the habeus

14

hearing — and here the issue is resolved in favor of the

IS

petitioner and said, "Yes, it was coerced," and yet the counsel

16

had said to him at the time, before he pleaded guilty, "These

17

are the chances that we take.

18

if you go to trial maybe it will be resolved against you."

19
20
21

This issue of credibility, and

Does that — what I'm trying to get at is, if that's
what develops, notwithstanding the finding at this habeus hear™
ing was that the police did beat it out of him, and it was

22

coerced; but counsel has just told him what the chances were

23

before he pleaded guilty and he had pleaded guilty; would you

24

think he would be entitled to relief?

25

A

Well, the Ninth Circuit says, "no," in a very

48

1

recent case, and I would say, "no,” also, under the decision

2

of the Circuit, because there are two elements —

3

Q

No? he is not entitled to relief?

4

A

Yes| there are two elements that have to be

5

proved; not only the fact that the confession was coerced, but

6

the fact that the confession was the substantial or the prime,

7

or the main motivating force behind entry of a. plea of guilty.

8

Now,there are only —

9

Q

Well, of course, a confession is, in my hypo­

the lawyer whethar or not ha should take a chance on the issue

the Second Circuit decision, that the defendant would lose,

8

given your hypothetical, because then this could be a situation,

9

possibly, where a lawyer could properly advise a defendant to

10

11

plead guilty despite the confession.
I think that there are other courts, as we have

12

pointed out in our brief, that do not take this hard and fast

13

line and feel that, or have granted relief in cases where the

14

attorney and/or the defendant, or both, had to take the con­

15

fession into account as one factor in determining the strategy

16

of whether to plead or go to trial? and to this extent —

17

Q

Well, 1 want to gat this very clear.

At least

18

it's not your position that the Second Circuit has said that a

19

finding at the hearing it has ordered that a confession that

20

was coerced, in and of itself, entitles the petitioner to have

21

his conviction on the guilty plea set aside?

22

A

That’s ~

23

Q

That’s not your position and you don’t think

24
25

the Court of Appeals has said that?

yes, I don’t think the Court of Appeals —
Q

2

Butt X gather you also answered that even if,

3

on the habeus hearing it is shown that that coerced confession

4

was a major factor in inducing the plea, that there would, not

5

be relief?

6

A

If it were a major factor in the terms that the

7

Second Circuit has spoken of? if the coerced confession were

8

theprline motivating factor and no other claims of considera­

9

tions then there would be relief.

20

But, I say that, the Second

Circuit has taken rather a hard line with this, because there
are other courts which have granted relief upon a showing that
the confession was coerced and that the confession was a factor
to be reckoned with in the pleading decision.

I think that.

that — I believe that the citations to those cases are at
page 32f footnote 29, Zachary against Hale, Cuevas against
Randle and Smiley against Wilson, where the courts, in the first
two cases in granting relief, say that court-appointed counsel
was forced, under the circumstances to give some consideration
and weight to an illegal confession.
Q

Mow you bring me something that Isve been

wanting to inquire about, if I may.

tion the court is going to have to hear what other evidence the
State had? is that not so?
A

Possibly.

13

in Vietnam."
Now, what kind of a predicament does that put the

15

State in?

16

I don't — the point, I think, that the dilemma

what motivated his plea of guilty; doesn’t he?

12

A

Well, it’s not just a question of motivation»

13

Q

If he says that motivated it, it’s pretty hard

14

to disprove? isn’t it?

15

A

Motivation is only one of the two aspects that

16

has to — or oneof the two factors that have to be: proved»

rights, because thereason that he's given relief is not his

But how do you get at that without the subjec­

tive tests, Mrs. Oberman?

1

Yes, but the motivation is not the "be all”

6

complain.

If the confession was not extracted by physical

Q

7

Well, what if he says, "I confessed orally to a

8

policeman only because he was beating me with his club on the

9

head, and this did happen and I did confess orally, and that's

10

the reason I pleaded guilty."
And then the State comes in and says, as far as we car

11
12

see there never was a confession of any kind: coerced or un­

13

coerced.

That doesn't necessarily disprove his case; does it?

14

A

Well, —

15

Q

He says it happened and that he did confess and

16

that the confession was beaten out of him and that's the reason,

17

the only reason, or the substantially-motivating reason that

18

induced his plea of guilty.

19

though the: State says, "We can’t find any confession at all."

Hasn’t he proved his case?

I don’t think so.

So? we're talking

By then the State comes back and says? "Yes? but we
had these — and the petitioner says ? "And that's the reason
pleaded guilty? this motivating reason or the sole reason,"
The State responds like in the Chief Justice's
hypothetical case? and says? '"We have these eight eyewitnesses.'
And the petitioner says? "Well? I didn't know that there were
any eyewitnesses? that wasn't my reason,
the coerced confession.

I did this because of

I didn’t know about, any eyewitnesses."

So? the State's showing that there were in fact?
eight? doesn’t defend against this claim? does it?

There are many hundreds of hearings.
Well? I would like to answer that by saying that

there have been hearings of this sort and perhaps the latest

case is French against the United States, which is a Ninth

2

Circuit case, where, after a Statehearing the District Court

3

Judge found that the confessions were taken in violation of

4

both Miranda and Escobedo, that they were illegal confessions,

5

but also found that the illegal confessions did not induce the

6

plea, because there were a number of other facts in the case.

7
8

Q

And wouldn't you have to show that the petitioner

knew of all those facts?

0

A

I don't —

10

Q

It's not sufficient for the State to show that

11

there were eight eyewitnesses; it has to show that the petitiones

12

knew there were eight eyewitnesses.

13
14

A

that this is hew it has been done.

15

16

I don't believe that this is -- I don't believe

Q

I think that --

Well, but that's the theory of the Second

Circuit Court of Appeals? isn't it?

17

A

But the —

18

Q

The confession has to have been shown to have

19

been motivated by the existence of a -- the plea has to have

20

been shown to have been motivated by the existence of a coerced

21

22

confession.

And that has to do with subjective motivation, so

you would have to show what is in the mind of the petitioner

23

and of what he had knowledge at the time of the plea; isn't that

24

right?

25

A

Not precisely, because I think the theory of
57

1

every other case that we cite in the appendix to our brief , is
also a substantial motivation theory, but for a substantial
motivation prime inducing factor, and we don't have to
psychoanalyze the defendant at the hearing to come to the
result.
It hasn’t proved that much of a problem in practice;
I think that that’s my only

the best answer that 1 can give.

The language is

Well, the old standard was:

any confession.

Is this plea of guilty voluntary or involun­

general test, conventionally.

And that's been the

Is that correct or am I all wrong

in this?
A

Well, I think that the test has been — yes,

whether or not the plea was voluntary, but what is voluntary?
50

1

Q

Yes; exactly»

That8s where the horse is

2

buried: what is voluntary?

these cases is, as 1 understand it, that the Court of Appeals

for the Second Circuit has now said, "Even though a plea is

Now, here, the one thing about

Have I misread the Court of Appeals* opinion?
With all deference, Your Honor, I don't believe

that was the basis of the decision at all»

The genesis of this

whole case came from Glenn against McMann.
Glenn against McMann was a decision which says that
the guilty plea was a waiver of all prior non-jurisdictional
defects, and refused to recognize the other side of the coin,
which was that an involuntary guilty plea is a -— and I think
that Chambers against Florida and Herman against Claudy, Walker
and Johnston, Waley and Johnston.

This Court has taken info

account the pressures brought to bear upon the defendant to get
him to plead, and specifically that one of those pressures
could be the existence of a coerced confession.
Q

I had understood those other cases with which I

am familiar, were posited on the proposition that the coercion
continued up until and through the timeof the plea.

He can —
Q

What's the difference

between a free choice in

the one case and the other?
A

I can't see a free choice when you have an

19

attorney, as in Richardson; the allegations were this:

20

picked up, X was subjected to physical and verbal abuse.

21

confessed my guilt to a crime X didnBt commit just to stop the

22

beating. X wanted to call a lawyer, because X know a lawyer,

23

but they wouldn*t let me call a lawyer.

24

assigned counsel to represent me in a capital case.

to see me for a ten-minute conference, and he said to me,

"X was

2

He talked to him for ten minutes»
When Richardson came to the court* told the attorney

3

4

h@ wanted to go to trial? he didn't want the plea that was

5

offered, because he only confessed since the confessionhad

6

been beaten out of him.
The attorney said, "This isn’t the proper time to

7
8

raise the confession.

9

your life and bring it up later by habeus corpus.”

completely wrong advice.

Fortuitously only. Your honor.

15

Q

Couldn't have been better.

16

A

You can't escape the fact that it was wrong

IS

u

It could have

been a —

17

advice at the time.

The Nicholson case in New York, as we

18

pointed out in our brief, was decided a year before and

19

Nicholson said a guilty plea is a waiver;'you can’t plead and

20

raise a coerced confession claim.

21

This man says, "I wanted to tell the court what those

22

police did to me, and my attorney said to me, ’don’t do it now.

23

Let’s go ahead, you know; let’s get it over with.’”

24
25

Q

Each one, and then it was Richardson, as I

understand it, turned down the original offer of a guilty plea
62

1

— opportunity to plead guilty to the greater charge and a

2

negotiated plea -- the bargain was then made that, he plead

3

guilty to the lesser charge» lesser degree of the same offense;

4

is that it?

S

A

6

The offer of a plea or a lesser degree is not

an uncommon offer in New York.

7

Q

Or anywhere else.

8

A

But, Secondly, it could very well be that

9

everything that Richardson says just wortffc wash at a hearing.

10

Perhaps the reason thathe pleaded was because offthe offer of

11

the lessee plea.

12

said, "This is a question thatcan only be resolved after a

13

hearing.

But, the Circuit recognised this? the Circuit

We can’t decide this on the pleadings."

14

But, my point .is that —

15

Q

16
17
18

Is there anything in the pleasings that says that

New York State was going to use that alleged confession?
A

No, Your Honor, and there is nothing in New

York State’s answers that say that they weren't.

W

Q

Well, you are sort of carrying the burden;

20

aren’t you?

2?

A

These cases are --

22

Q

Well, let me put it another way;

What consti­

23

tutional right was violated when that policeman beat him up —

24

assuming that he did?

25

at that stage?

What constitutional right was violated

Wellff 1 believe that, there is a -- well», at

Isn’t it true that it doesn't become a con­

stitutional right unless it is presented as evidence?

5

A

I don't think so, Your Honor.

S

Q

Well? what right was violated when they beat

7

him up to get a confession?

8

Q

It might be the 1983 action? mightn’t it?

9

G

For what?

10

A

I would —

1?

Q

Constitutional right.

12

A

What comes into the"mind

is the Fifth Amendment

1.3

14th Amendment says that we just can’t permit this kind of

14

thing.

15

Q

But that's due process of law.

What you can’t

16

permit is the admission of a coerced confession in a court of

17

law? by the prosecution.

18

Q

We could have the policeman convicted or you

19

would sue for damages? but what constitutional right, is

20

violated if the State never uses the alleged confession?

21

A

But the point here is that if it was a motivat­

22

ing factor to induce a plea the State has the benefit of that

23

wrong its police officers committed in that back room of the

24

stationhouse.

25

Q

Are we going to assume a State is going to use
64

1

evidence in violation of the Constitution?

2

A

I don't make a presumption one way or another.

3

Q

1 guess the presumption would have to be the

4

other way; wouldn't it?
A

5

I'm sorry, Your Honor; I don’t agree»

The

6

State made this argument in their brief and our counter-argument

7

to that is that there has been case after case in which they

8

did introduce it.
And 1 ■think in this respect —-

9

Q

10

We don’t know how-many cases there may have been

!1

where they didn’t, because that would never be a matter of

12

record.

13

A

That’s right.

And this is something that is

14

pointed out, I think, very cogently by Professor Altshuler in

15

his University of Chicago Law Review article, where he says .

16

that sometimes compromise pleas are offered by the Prosecution

17

to cover up constitutional weaknesses in their case.

18

And I would think that the extent to which it could

19

be shown by 9 petitioner that he was offered a plea to a lesser

20
21

agree in his case, because the prosecuting attorney was worried
*vabput the legality of his confession. To that extent, bad

22

faith is present.

23

Q

But then, on a close question, a choice is

24

made, why is not that the end of it?

25

hypothetically“dose case that may or may not be admissible.
65

You have just posed a

i

Why isn't the choice then final?

z

District auclfg review it eight* ten or twelve years later?
A

3

Instead of having to have a

In these cases I think the petitioners them­

4

selves cry out as to why the choice is not final.

Each man

5

says* "I was coerced into confessing to a crime I did not

6

commit* and I pleaded because I had no other alternative.”

7

And if the law's ears are closed to this kind of plea* just for

S

the name of finality* I think that we haven't gained anything.
The other way* okay* we have to work a little bit

9

harder* but it's worth it in order to uncover the one instance

n

of injustice that may exist or the five or the ten or the

12

twenty.

13

And there are — the plea is the least circumscribed

14

of all procedures upon which a conviction is predicated.

15

what goes on behind the scenes may not be that savored.

16
17

And

I would just like to turn to the Williams’ petition
for a moment* because I think that Mr. Juviler misstated
</

IS
I»

Williams’ claims to a certain extent.
Williams alleged that he was 20 years old when he

20

was arrested* that he was held without hooking* he wasn’t

21

informed of his rights* he was handcuffed to a chair; he was

22

beaten; he had no food or sleep.

23

Nov/* because of this he confessed and he alleged that

24

the confession was false.

Ee said that he wasinitially offered

25

a plea* but ha refused to plead guilty* but his attorney told
66

1

him that the plea was merely to a misdemeanor and Williams

2

alleged that the judge at pleading never told him that the

3

crime he had pleaded to was a felony.

4

produced the Williams5 hearing minutes, so we don01 know

5

whether or not the trial judge informed him.,

Well, the State never

6

Q

And what was the offense?

7

A

Robbery.

8

Q

Larceny or burglary?

9

A

Robbery.

10

Q

Robbery under the statutory —

11

A

Now, Williams also alleged that he told his

12

attorney that he had an alibi defense and the attorney refused

13

to raise it at trial.

14

"pulled out of the thin air."
The only fadt

15

This, as Mr. Jnviler referred, was

one significant fact that I think

16

we can come forward with was a fact that appears on the so-

17

called "DCI sheet" which the attorney General, annexed to their

18

answer in District Court, which shows that Mr. Williams, in

19

fact,

20

Ohio in

court on a day when hewas in jail -- or in New York

21

City in

court on a day when he was in jail in Dayton, Ohio.

on a prior date had been identified as being in Dayton,

And

22

So

that factor in itself, givesone a little bit of

23

disquiet.

that again, what the Circuit did in this Williams

24

case was to look at the allegations, to say, "Do these allega­

25

tions state a claim which, if proved at a hearing, would have
67

1

entitled the petitioner to relief?"

2

if these allegations were proved at a hearing there is not one

3

court in the country that could say that this was a voluntary

4

plea»

5

defendant clearly and voluntarily acknowledged his guilt, but

6

because of factors outside of his control which were brought to

7

bear and he was left with no alternative»

3

9

And I think the answer is;

This was a plea that was produced, not because the

Q

Well, what about the positive statement that he

did kill the woman?

10

A

This was Richardson,

Your Honor.

II

Q

Yes? what about that one?

12

A

I think —

13

Q

Do you say the coercion went that far?

He said

14

said in the plea; "Yes, I'm guilty to everything," but then

15

he’s asked a specific crime and he said, "Yes? I did it."

16

A

If that confession was involuntary, and'if the

17

confession was the reason that he made this in-court admission,

18

then that in-court admission is tainted, and I think that here

19

I must cite Harrison against the United States, where similar

20

kind of situation was considered, because in that case the

2!

defendant had made a confession which was introduced into

22

evidence at the first trial and defendant took the stand in

23

order to counter certain statements that, were contained in the

24

confession»

25

When the confession was rendered involuntary, the
68

1

State sought to introduce the in-court admissions at the second

trial„

Could he have
Could he

He has admitted guilt to the crime and everything
else? could he have said "no?"
A

Well, it would be very difficult to say "no,"

10

after there is a confession and you have an attorney who is

11

not willing to —

12

Q

But he could have said "no?14

13

A

He couldhave said "no," and the house

14
15
16
17

could

have fallen on his head, even harder than it did fall.
Q

It didn’t have to? the judge still could have

accepted the plea? couldn’t he?
A

I -- in New York that’s really not so clear,

18

because New York has a couple of cases which hold that if

19

inconsistent material comes out in the pleadings, then the

20

judge does have a duty to make further inquiry.

21

22
23

25

Q

Well, but he could have?

that all of the other was on one side and this is on the other

z

Q

Well5 would your submission be, in trouble so

3

far as 1 am concerned, if I can put it in two compartments?

4

If I can?
A

5

Weil, if the in-court admission is going to be

6

isolated from everything that happened before the statements in

7

court were made, then no collateral attack upon a plea of

8

guilty is possible.

9

Q

Suppose, insteadof just asking the question as

10

was put here: "Did you commit tha crime," and getting an

fi

affirmative answer, suppose the trial judge, the judge taking

12

the plea, says: "Ifow, tell me what you did."

13

then related in great detail all of the circumstances, how the

U

crime was planned and executed.

And the defendant

Would you make the same arguments with reference to

15
16

the possibility of an alleged coerced confession, as you now

17

do?

10

A

Yes, Your Honor, because if it —

f9

Q

In other words, then the issue does not have

20

anything to do with guilt or innocence, but. only with what led

21

the man to decide to make the plea?

22

A

Well, guilt or innocence; is relevant to a

23

certain extent, but I don't think it!s dispositive because in

24

all cases where the voluntariness or the intelligent nature of

25

the plea is considered, the allegation that a man is innocent
70

1

is not critical, because we're arguing due process,
Q

2

We are speaking, though, in the context of the

3

case

where it's being tried and the question of the use of the

4

confession is involved. Isn't that quite different when you

5

come to a plea of guilty?
A

6

No, Your Honor, because a plea can be coerced

7

even

from a man who is guilty and in such a case the due pro­

8

He alleged that he was

police was to get them to stop beating him, even though he

9

hadn't committed the crime.
He alleged that he was given, court-assigned counsel

10

who refused to do anything to prepare for trial and he also

12

affirmatively misled him about the time for raising the issue

13

of coerced confession.
Now, Richardson said, in effect: "Because of the

coerced confession, because my counsel didn't do anything for

16

me, I had no choice other than to plead guilty; therefore, I

A

You’re not going to say that? are you?

Well, but still and all no complaint was made

15

and possibly at a hearing the fact that no complaint was made

might be considered dispositive either of the truth or falsity

17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

18

MR. JUVILER:

Thank you, Mrs. Obernan.

As Mrs. Oberman says, it's very

19

difficult to assess the competency of counsel and it's rarely

20

required that a Federal Court do so, but I wager to say that if

21

Mr. Williams' attorney had attempted to wrest an alibit defense

22

at trial on the defendant's fingerprint record, then the

23

attorney ®uld have come to the attention of the Appellate

24

Division long before that divorce case.

25

This fingerprint record merely shows that two persons

77

1

wfcih the name William McKinley, or Williams McKinley or

2

McKinley Williams were in custody? one in Ohio and the other

3

in New York and it expressly states that there are no finger­

4

print cards to support this statement.

S

Nor must, we assume that the Richardson petition,

6

even with the supplementary affidavit, establishes ineffective

7

assistance of counsel.

8

The defendant Richardson was charged with a doable

9

killing by stabbing? two first degree murders. The attorney

10

secured for him a plea of guilty to one second degree murder

11

and Your Honors will recall from the pleading colloquy that

12

his client unequivocally admitted his guilt of this crime.

13

Q

What was he charged with?

14

A

He was charged with stabbing to death two

15
16

people at the same time.
And he admits in his motion papers before this court

17

that the police knew that three men had seen him in the company

!8

of the deceased pair before they started an altercation which

19

led to their death.

20

and he admits that these people who died were his relatives.

21

22
23
24
25

He admits that he had blood on his clothing

And he further acknowledges that he gave the police
a false alibi prior to the initiation of the coercive tactics
which he now alleges.
And he attributes this false alibi to his desire to
avoid getting these three men in trouble.
78

1

Further, Mr» Richardson acknowledges that he did

2

have two conferences, although they were brief, with his

3

attorney, respecting the admissibility of these confessions

4

and the attorney came to a reasoned decision that the best ■—

5

or that he was not going to succeed if he attempted to keep it

6

out of evidence»
The only defense tendered to any court at any stage

1
8

of the litigation against Mr. Richardson is that in his

9

District Court h.abeus corpus petition, which is surely a very

10

weak foundation for a defense to a first-degree murder charge.
At the time of the altercation Mr. Richardson alleges,

11
12

involving these two persons, his relatives: "I was the only

m

other person present and when they drew knives and started

14

stabbing at each other I tried to stop them and break them

Richardson I thought was the North Distirct.

22

No? Richardson — oh, the petition was in the

23

Northern District.

Oh, because that's where he was incarcerated?
