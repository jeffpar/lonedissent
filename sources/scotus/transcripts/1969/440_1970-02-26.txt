proceed.
MR.KLEINDIENST2

This case comas fcothe Court on

12

certiorari tothe Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit.

It

13

raises a specific thatin the opinion of the Government, a

14

very important issue as to the admini&ration of the National

IS

Labor RElations Act; and it presents the precise question of

16

whether on the eve of, or at or about the time of a represen­

17

tation election under the Act, the employer engages in unfair

18

labor practice activity? whether such unfair labor practice

W

activity is rendered moot and therefore not susceptible to a

m

enforcing order from the Court of Appeals by virtue of a sub­

21

sequent representation election which the union, lost that came

22

after the unfair labor practice activity.

i

23

The facts in the case, I think are likewise, rather

24

direct and not controversial.

The union in the case began its

25

organisational activities among the ®saploy@ss in the Fall of

j

1

1964„ on the eve

of the representation election a few days

2

before,, representatives of the company engaged in conduct

3

which subset?-: -**4*ly, as I will outline, were determined to be

4

in violation "dfthe Act.
An ©lection was held? the union lost the election.

5
6

The union petitioned to have the election set aside and at the

7

same time filed unfair labor practice, filed a complaint with

j

8

the Board 4»d charged to the Board and the Board subsequently

j

9

filed its complaint.
Thereafter the Board heard evidence with respect to

10
11

the alleged unfair labor practice activity and issued its

12

order against the employer to cease and desist in the conduct.
Following the order of the Board, a second election

13
14
15

8
17
8
19

20
21

was held.

Again, which the union lost, and that election was

set aside for reasons which are not material here and do not
appear in this record.
After the second election the Board petitioned the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for an order enforcing

.

its order against the Respondent company and after that
petition to the Court of Appeals, a third election was held,
and again the union lost the election.
■

22
23
24
25

But at this time there was no objection filed by the ;
union or the employees with respect to be conduct of the
election and the Board certified the election as being valid.
Q

Do the records show, Mr. Kleindienst, whether

i

1

the unionss vote increase, decreased? what happened in the

2

success of elections?

3

A

4

I believe my recollection of the record is that

the union votes decreased»

5

0

Decreased?

6

A

Yes; that the union's position became stronger

7

in the situation that is in the record here; but that's my

8

recollection of it»

9

or another to the determination of this issue, if the Chief

10

Justice please»

11

Well, if their total ballot .decreased as each

12

election went on it might suggest somerelationship between the

13

company's— the continuing impact, the continuing effect of

n

the company's anti-union activities, would it not?
A

is

That could possibly be it, but I think —

16

there are

17

employees, other conduct, the issues raised in the election»

18

I would say thatyou would almost have to have precise evidence

19

of a point like that, Mr. Chief Justice, before that would be

20

a supportable inference all by itself; and just the mere fact

21

that the votes went up or down erne way or another.

22

be my opinion in this regard.

23
24
25

so many other factors that could occurs turnover of

Q

That would

Does the record show, since you have already-

been interrupted, before you resume; does the record show the
reason that the second election was set aside?

4

A

1

Nos and I don't believe that any inference can

2

be gained from this record as to the fact that it was set

3

aside.,

4

improper for the Government to suggest? inferentialiv or other-

5

wise that that second election was set aside as a result of

6

misconduct on the part of the Respondent company.

1

doesn't show it is, Mr. Justice, and. 1 don't want to infer

8

that it, was a continuation of improper conduct on the part of

9

the company.

There is nothing in the record and I think it would be

!

10

The record

"Now, when the matter got to the Court of Appeals for |

11

the Ninth Circuits, the Respondent company brought to the

12

attention, of the court the fact that a valid subsequent elec-”

13

tion had been held and asked the court to dismiss all ©f the

14

proceedings involved in the matter and asked it to reply upon

15

its decision in the General. Engineering case of 1962.

16

17
18

The court, in a. pro curiam decision, did deny the
Respondent company's motions' to dismiss all the proceedings.
And I think it's significant, to point out

here that

19

they did not determine on the merits, when it had it before it,

20

as a matter of fact, based upon their record considered as a

2!

whole, and the law, whether in fact the Responant company was

22

guilty of committing the unfair labor practices.

23

threw the whole thing out on the grounds that thematter had

24
25

They just

become moot and no longer of any import as a result of the
third subsequent valid election.
5

j

1

The Board petitioned for certiorari, raising three

2

fundamental questions,

3

else conflict between the decisionof the Ninth Circuit on the

4

one hand and the Seventh Circuit in almost identical eases.

S

j

one, it presented a very clear, pre-

The decision of the Ninth Circuit in Raytheon in this case and

6

General Engineering conflictsin the opinion or the Government

'7

with clearly enunciated, opinions of this Court dealing

8

ally and broadly in this field.

9

Then finally, it presented a good question of policy

10

with respect to the effectuation of the policies and the ad­

11

ministration of the National Labor Relations Act.

12

•

The Respondentse argument in the case seems to be

13

essentially predicated upon the statement that since Section

14

10 (e) of the Act confers upon the Court of Appeals to review

IS

decisions of the National Labor Relations Board, thatthat

IS

expression is a broad one and that the Court below properly

r?

exercised its broad discretion in dismissing this case on the

18

grounds of mootness.

19

As a- preface to my argument, and if the Court will
.

20

grant me permission, I would like to direct the close attention;

21

to a case that was not cited in the Government's brief, nor in

22

briefs filed by the REspondenf company.

■

23

I called Mr. Resnick Monday, when the case came to my

24

attention and indicated my desire to do so, and I believe that \

23

he will say, without objection, that 1 may.

6

The reason thatit j

I

was not cited, it's a decision of Mr. Justice Marshall, which

2

was written cm December 15th of this term of the Court and it,

3

was handed down after the brie Is on behalf of the Government

4

were filed.
And that3s your cases NLRB versus Rutter-Rex.. The

S
6

j

reason why we filed is that the Supreme Court, this Court,
.

1

very clearly and concisely said what it had said before, and

8

that is to say that the remedial powers that the National

-.9

Labor Relations Board are broad, is a broad discretionary power

10

and they are subject to but limited review#
,

11

And I think that this case, this recent decision of

12

this Court in the opinion of the Government, is practically

13

dispositive of the Respondent company here.

14

IS
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Because the only

way that Respondent company can get to this point is to say
that Section 10(e) confers upon the Courts of Appeals very
broad, discretionary powers in. the review orders of the National
Labor RE1ations Board.
1 think the best example of that is the decision of
this Court in National Labor Relations Board versus Mexia
Textile which was handed down by this Court in 1349.
case the issue was whether or not the Board

In that

could go to the

Court of Appeals to enforce its orders even if the Respondent
employer had voluntarily complied with the order of the Board.
And the issue is raised to the Court of Appeals that: "There is;
no reason for you to consider this matter any longer.

7

The

f

Board said that we eng ge in illegal activity and conduct.

2

We agreed with it? we have complied with it, so why 'have an

3

order of the Board enforcing the conduct that was already com­

4

plied with, or corrected?"

5

This Court, I think, correctly held that since this

S

kind of conduct can he continuing in nature, the mere showing

7

of compliance, voluntary or not, by the employer in any one

8

given point of time, would not be si bar to the Board:s right

9

to get an enforcement, ’ however, so that it would have availablej

10

to it, a contempt citation and order in the event the employer I

11

came along subsequent to its voluntary compliance and engaged

12

in similar conduct»

t

,v

!3

I think also under decisions of this Court, which go

14

to the whole question of mootness, bring to bear the essential

15

problem that’s involved in this case.

16

As this Court has held in the United States versus

17

W» T» Grant Company, you should not dismiss a case on the

18

grounds of mootness iant.il only there is a reasonable expectation

19

that there will never be a recurrence of the wrong again»

20

there is a strong burden imposed upon the wrongdoer to come

2!

forward and show that, regardless of our intent and the cir­

22

cumstances, it is likely that the conduct will not occur again»

If

.

23

■

And 1 think again, as this Court has held in Walling

'/

>'<

i

I sifR® 11 sS SB H fBIS ft JH't

24

versus Reuter, this is true, so that the courts or the adminis­

25

trative boards and agencies can always have in its hip pocket,

j

i

1

so to speak, the arrow to its bow of a contempt citation

2

issued by a court in the event the wrongdoer commits the wrong

3

again»

4

And then, finally, of course, just from the stand­

5

point of public policy in the administration of the Act, and

6

I think it's this point that the Court should be primarily

\

concerned about, because if you take the Respondent * o argument 1

7

just at first blush, he would make the Court believe,- 1 think

8

that there is something integral and indigenous about Section

9

8 of the Act, dealing with unfair labor practice conduct on the

10

one hand, and Section 9 of. the Act, which deals with represen­

11

tation elections.

12

Section 7 of the Act guarantees to employees

the right to engage in concerted activities for their mutual

13

aid and protection.

14

.And I think that this guarantee in Section 7 of the

15

Act, ©acompasses several portions of the balance of the Act.

16

One of them, of course, is; the representation election.

17

Em­

ployees under this Act, have a right to, in a free environment,

18

'

the Board has said, I think, many times in the past, ideally,

19

under the laboratory conditions that the Board would like to

20

see exist, to organise among themselves, to designate a union

21

as their collective bargaining agent, to have a representation

22

election whereby such a bargaining agent can be certified.
23
But this right that is conferred upon employees in

24

terms of self-organization, is a distinct, separate right under
25

9

ii

;

1

the Act in terms of its policies,,

Then the prohibitions that

2

are contained in Section 6 of the Act, that deal with unfair
■

S

labor, practice activities»
One of the reasons why you have Section 8 of the Act,,

4
5

is to give the Board and, the courts a machinery by which you

6

can create these so-called "laboratory conditions/5 so that,

7

employees can make a free choice with respect to the selection:

8

of their collective bargaining agent.
And for an employer to come along as the Respondent

8
10

feampany has.in this case, to say that;

11

had two or three'shots at this election and they lost it, and

tz

what we might have done with respect to the first one,should'

13

*4
15
16
17

20
21

have to do, then, is to permit employers to engage in this kind;
of conduct and the union could have 3, A, 5 or 6 elections
and the courts would really never have a means by which to
stop the illegal activity and conduct.
Q

24

2S

Would/vou, Mr. Attorney General, you seem to

agree that if a court determined there was no really substantial
chance ©f the conduct ever being repeated that it could be
dismissed as moot?

j

be rendered moot, I think begs the question,, because all you

Well, really, they have

A

Yes.

The Jones and Laughlin steal case in

Q

So, this is really what it amounts to is sort

1936 —

of a fact-bound case, then h®re.

10

You just want us to disagree

I

i

with the judgment of the Court of Appeals that this conduct is

2

not contrary to their thinking,, really might occur again.

A

3
4

I don't think the Court of Appeals really went

into that question,, Mr. Justice.

5

Q

Do you think they applied the wrong 'standard'?

@

A

1 don't believe they applied any standard at all

.

7

If • they had been: aware of the Messia ca§e of' this. Court, when

8

it carae down to the General Engineering case in 1962, I don’t

9

think they would ever have arrived at that result.

10

Q

I

What you’re saying is that we should vacate the
j

11

12

judgment and have it reconsidered under the right standards?
A

Yes, sir.

In my opinion what should be done is |

!3

to vacate the act of the Court of Appeals, send it back to it,

14

have it determine

15

the record considered as a whole and as a matter of law, and

IS

then if the Court of Appeals, which I wouldn’t expect it to do,

17

came forth with an erroneous application of the law or exer­

IS

19
20

the unfair labor practice on the merits,

cise of its discretionary powers, you would have something
before this Court that would have some substance and merit.
Q

But, X suppose that certain unfair labor prac­

21

tice could be so tied to a particular election like, for ex­

22

ample, in the first election' they had a poll watcher? something

23

that they shouldn’t have and there was a complaint about it.

24
25

A

Mr. Justice, that raises a good point, because

not all conduct that the Board looks at as being improper

11
i

1

conduct at. the time of election constitutes an unfair labor

2

practice.

3

Q

I agree»

4

A

Like we have the 24 hour rule here.

5

Q

And also, I suppose there is some kind of con-

6
7

duct in connection with an election that no reasonable man
would think would ever be repeated.
A

8
9

Right.

As a matter of fact, I think the

Respondent company neglected to point out the fact that in the

10

three forms of illegal conduct in this case, that is to say,

11

interrogating the employees and the illegal speech that this

ia

company also initiated a new grievance procedure which tbs Cauri

13
14

15

held was unfair labor practice conduct.

procedure is a continuing procedure, presumably^, although the
record doesn't show, it exists today.
So that as our reports held, in the Second, Fourth

the right.

They have

Indeed, in this case the inference is -strong that

they will want to because they have tried it three times already
and if you have in the environmental factors that, exist at this
particular plant, conduct of a continuing nature which the
Board has said is unfair labor practice conduct in violation
of Section 8(a)(1) and Section 7 of the Act, then 1 think in
terns of effectuating the policies of the National Labor

12

j

1

Relations Act, that these employees are not going, to be able to;

2

decide the choice of their collective bargaining represents™

3

hives in a free environment*
And that's the essential policy ©f the Act that's

4
S

6

j

involved here*

If, to ba sura that the National Relations

Board is being given the weapon that the statute contemplated, i

7

that is to say, a eontempt citation from the Courts of Appeals

8

so that employers will'be restrained from engaging in a con/
tinning form of conduct in order that at least, with respect, to

10

If
IE

this aspect of the Act, the employees will be able to choose
their collective bargainig agent in an environment free of
coercion and inducements and benefits or threats or promises.
Q

13
14

IS
16

Of course. Section 10(e) of the Act does give

to the Courts of Appeals a very- great deal' of discretion m

o

what they shall do in response to an enforcement proceedings.
«*

A

Yes o

Q

And we both know that Courts of Appeals, like

1?

18
19
2©
21

22

other courts, are overburdened with a. great deal of work and,
I gather, it's your adversary position that while it's almost
one of confession and avoidance, while perhaps "moot” is the
wrong word here, nonetheless, Section 10(e) does not absolutely
require the Court of Appeals to give full consideration on the
merits to every single enforcement, proceedings, and here in this

23
particular case there is simply good reason for them to exer­
24
cise the flexibility conferred on the Courts of Appeals by •
25

13

1

Section 10(e) to simply wash this case out.
A

2

I respectfully disagree with that, Mr. Justice.

14

wanted to cut off part of the back-pay award because the Board

had been derelict in its duties to promptly process it, and

Mr. Justice Marshall, I think, appropriately pointed out that

17

this Act is for the benefit of employees and not for. the bene­

18

fit of the Board or an employer with respect to back-pay orders <

19

But, that was a back-pay ogder.

What this company,

this Respondent company wants yon to do is to completely

case appeared

As the record stood before th© Court ©f Appeals,

19

Raytheon was an employer of approximately 40,000 people, with

20

plants in a number of locations throughout the country.

21

ployees at a number of plants, including two in California,

22

were represented by unions and there had never been a strike by■

23

Raytheon employees.

24
23

Em­

Approximately 19 petitions for election had been
filed at Raytheon plant? during the period between I960 and 196C

17

1

And prior to the case before you, no objections had been filed

2

as to Raytheon's preelection conduct in any of those; and of

3
4

course, no elections had been set aside,
■
On January 4, 1965, the IDE filed a petition with the-

5

Board for a representation election to be held in a unit of

6

production and maintenance employees at Raytheon5s Mountain

1

View, California plant.

8

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers expressed interest in the pro­

9

ceeding and an election was agreed upon for February 4, 1965,

10

On February 2, two day? before the election, Robert

n

Hennemuth, Raytheon5® Vice President of Industrial Relations,

iz

delivered an address to eight groups of employees,

13

Speeches were substantially identical in conduct, emphasising

14

the importance of voting, explaining how the collective bar­

15

gaining process works, making a comparison of wages and fringe

16

benefits with other Raytheon plants and with other companies

\7

and requesting employee support,

Subsequently the International

The

audience, Hennemuth repeatedly emphasised that the election was

tradition,18

He stated repeatedly that he could not and would

not promise any benefits or make any threats of reprisal.
He pointed out that, and I quote; "We doa^fc know how any of
you voted anyway, so don81 worry about it."

On these facts, the rule of law should be derived

from the decision of the Court, below, and from its prior de­

the national Labor REIatIons Board that an employer is engaged j

4

in unfair labor practice conduct» but you can't do anything

about it.

because you would again have the total environment beclouded

7

by a statement by the National Labor Relations Board that this

8

company had engaged in illegal conduct and yet» if in. fact.» it

9

had» there couldn't be an order of the court to make them cut

10

it out and if it hadn’t» 1’ think this company would be under

11

the burden always of being accused of this type of conduct,

What you have is a naked.» ineffectual statement, by

had I think that further complicates this situation»

Q

12

It would have some effect» would it not» Mr.

13

Attorney General, in the sense — I*m speaking now of the exis­

14

tence of the determination of an unfair labor practice,, that

15

if a new complaint were issued at a later time and the conduct

16

were a similar conduct» the Board certainly would have his eye

17

on the prior determination —

A

18

19

X think what it would do» instead» Mr, Chief

Justice» would run right up to the Court of Appeals and say»
■

20

"You gave us an order , ordering these people not to do'this "-and

21

they have done it and we want you to hold them guilty of

22

contempt„

23
24
25

Q

Well» I'm going on the assumption that there

would be no continuing effect.

The Ninth Circuit's judgment,

was left, standing and you had no enforcement order» there would

31

1

still be some impact on the unfair labor practice determination

2

itself? would there not?
A

3

Well, that might have some impact on the Board’s
/

4

decision.

Then you would get into problems of whether or not

5

improper inferences or illegal inferences are brought, as a

6

result of prior conduct,

7

I think the best way to clean the case up, really,,

8

and get rid of this principle of law that inadvertently came

9

out of the Ninth Circuit, and it doesn’t square itself with the

10

policy of this Court or the decisions of other circuits, is to

11

send it back there and ask them to find out whether, in fact,

12

this company engaged in unfair labor practice activities.

13

they didn’t then dismiss the whole kit and kaboodle and if they

14

did, then make them susceptible to a consent citation.

15

■Q

If

Well, that seems to me to be rather inconsistent

16

with what you said earlier that we seemed to concede that if

17

the Court of Appeals had made the determlnsfelon that there

18

wasn't my substantial chance of any recurrence of this conduct

19

that it could, have properly refused enforcement.

20
21

A

No.

If you interpreted ray remarks as saying

that, Mr. Justice, I think you mi .sunder stood me,

I said that

22

there is conceivably some fact situation where they could.

23

don’t believe they exist in this kind of a case.

I

And if you

You mean the *— a court

can find arid it could be conceded by the union that, well,

2

there's really no meaningful chance that that conduct will ever

3

recur?

4

A

1 can

5

Q

And then, but nevertheless, we insist that you

8

adjudicate this unfair labor practice, which will take you a

7

lot of time and energy and then if you agree with the Board

8

you must then enter a cease and desist order.
A

9

IQ

Oh, 1 agree with you on that, Mr. Justice,

but I do not agree that this is that kind of a case.
Q

11

Well, 1 know, but that’s another point.

Why

12

should we — you apparently think there is some standard by

13

which the mootness or nonenforceability should be judged.

14

And at. the very least you' claim the Court of Appeals didn’t

15

apply it.

♦

16

A

Right..

17

Q

And if there is that'kind of a stant&rd"that

18

didn't apply, why shouldn’t that have the job, not. us, ox

13

20

A

Well, 1 think this Court has applied the stand­

21

ard generally, and 1 think the Ninth Circuit has misapplied it.

22

I don't believe that ‘tills record shows that there's no reason­

23
