MR. WILMER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

serviceable to the Court if we would first put in proper re­

12

I think at the outset it might be appropriate and

I would say at the outset that the position of the

17

to this question and proceed onto as best we can to explain the

As we view our responsibility

other proceedings in the court below.
I think the best way to put the record in proper
relationship to the actual facts is perhaps to begin with the

21

response that was filed by the Committee in the Supreme Court

22

ofthe State of Arisona.

23
24
25

Now, it is my understanding, from reading the rules?,
of this Court, that papers that are certified by the Clerk of
the lower court are part of the record and subject to being in

1

this case.

2

which is part cf the Petitioner's filing with this Court, ex­

4

Q

In other words, this was the discussion of

Could I ask a question?

Assume this litigation

never had been brought and Mrs. Baird had simply persisted in
her view that she didn't have to answer the question.

What

would have happened to her application to the Bar, for
admission to the Bar?
MR. WILMER:

Her application would still, as it is today,

be sitting on our shelves waiting for her to complete the
processing of it, or

something else would have happened.

I might say this briefly, the Committee in Examinations
and Admissions is a hand-maiden of the Arizona Supreme Court.
We have no authority other than that which the Court gives us.
I might say the entire rules of the Arizona Supreme
Court are in Volume 17 of West Statutes.

They govern, they

limit, they set the extent of our authority.

6

We have no

1

inherent authority of any kind, no rights, other than those

2

given us by the rules.

3

Therefore, when the Court says to us, "Ask these questions

4

and they are set out verbatim, "Get an answer to them and

5

proceed to certify to this Court your opinion," we have no

6

choice.

7

can reject it.

I suppose we could, and perhaps we should.

But the facts are, unless and until that question is
answered, or someone else tells us that we must do something
else, the case matter will stay as it is.
Q

Is it fair to say in practical effect, as far as

her position is concerned, your continuing disent on it, on
the hypothetical premise no litigation would be brought here,
would be the equivilent of your saying, "You are required to
answer that question.

the Court:

By interaction between the rules and the Committee# s

action, for practical purposes, I would concede: Mrs. Baird
is for the moment, stymied.
But to call upon the Arizona Supreme Court to make an
effective ruling, that is not a matter within our province.

25
1

11

1

I would simply say that as of the moment at least, the Arizona

2

Supreme Court has been told by the Committee that we have not

3

made a decision.

4

Court has simply said,"We deny the petition.

5

complete the processing of this petition."

We are unable to make one and therefore the
You should

I might say for the purpose of my next statement to the

6
7

Court that this letter of April 24, 1968, which antedated

8

the beginning of this proceeding, to Mr. Allen, Chief Counsel

9

for the Petitioner, has, I believe, some validity and some

10

value in determining what in effect, what in fact, 1 should

11

say, is the actual position of the Committee and the Court

12

below, and the Committee here.

i

7

53

**“

•

This
letter said,
y-

"1 also believe Mrs. Baird should

14

realize even though she answered the question, she had at one

15

time been a communist or otherwise associated with organiza­

16

tions not friendly to the United States Government, this would

17

not necessarily cause us to reject her application.
"We would want to ask her some questions as to her present

18
19

beliefs and as to other matters bearing upon the effect of

20

such membership would have on her qualifications to practice

21

law. "

22
23
24
25

|

The Committee is aware that under present Supreme Court
decisions, mere membership in an organization is not sufficient,
necessarily, to disqualify anyone from positions of responsi­
bility and this would be the attitude of the Committee in this

8

1

matter.
Now, I say that for this reason:

2

If it please the

3

Court, we have had here what I would term a somewhat rather

4

"fancy steps down the sideline," so to speak, of what words

3

mean.

would be proud of having admitted?
Now, a fair reading, I believe, if it please the Court,
of the Committee's letter to Mr. Allen, the Committee's
response to the Arizona Supreme. Court, and of our response
here, indicates simply one thing:

Whether we use the word

belief, the word view, or whatever word we use, we are concerned
with one thing.
I heard yesterday the question asked, if Mr. Baird would
prefer the record be made in the Court below or here, and I
believe ha said here.

I have to confess surprise.

I wrote

them both and really didn't think I was saying anything
different at one time than the other.

I thought we were

saying to the Court below and this Court, that if Mrs. Baird
9

1

believes in the sense she would actively advocate and

2

assist and advance the overthrow of the Government of the Unite*3

3

States and the State of Arizona by force and violence,

4

we want no part of her, nor will we recommend her for admission

3

to our Supreme Court unless and until we are told to do so

6

by some higher authority.

I meant by that was she preparing to go out and

Let us take the first one.

Suppose she is willing

to walk up and down the street?
MR. WILMER:

Advocating the; overthrow of the Government

16

by force and violence?

17

No. 1, that would go against the Cannons of Ethics which say

18

you shall do nothing to bring it disrepute, the profession

19

of the law or the Courts.

20

says, ”1 propose to walk up and down the streets after I am

21

admitted as a lawyer, proclaiming to the world that I, a lawyer,

22

believe we should blow up the Capitol, assassinate public

23

officials, and otherwise change the form of Government by force,"

24

we want no part of her.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

May 1 ask you another

question?

3

MR. WILMER:

4

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

yes, Your Honor.
Does this application

S

require an applicant to stat© whether he or she has ever been

6

convicted of a criminal act?

7

MR. WILMER:

It as3ts the usual question of whether

3

or not they have been involved in fraud? v?hether or not they

9

have had a bond claim made against them and have they been in­

10
11

volved in a criminal action.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now, suppose an appli­

12

cant refuses to answer that question? would that applicant be,

13

then, in the same posture that Mrs. Baird is in at the present

14

time, with reference to the Board’s action?

15

MR. WILMER:

Yes.

I-'m sure we are not going to

say, "You refused to tell us if you stole money somewhere., .so

we are going to admit you anyway."

question might be: "Yes, when I was 14 years old I was found

22

MR. WILMER:

Honor, we have admitted people that in their younger days had

MR, WXLMER:

5

If she answered "yes/’ to

Twenty-seven?

No; it would not bar

6

her; no.

We would then endeavor to find out how deep did that

7

belief lie; and if it lay on the surface and was simply a'

8

childish thing; a pass'ing fancy, that’s on® thing; if it de­

9

scended to the depths of an embedded true fanatical feeling the

10

Government should be destroyed, I, for one, feel that a person

11

should not be admitted to practice law.

12

Now, I would like to certainly say, then, Your

13

Honor, that we are told this belief that Mrs. Baird talks about

14

is a political belief; it’s a political matter; it is something

15

which is protected by the decisions of this Court, therefore we

IS

should not be permitted to inquire into thought processes in

17

connection with it. .

18
19

I find it difficult, if it please the Court, to
believe that the notion of a bomb dropped at the appropriate
'N.

20

time in 17 diffa'«snt places in the United States in

an attempt

2%

to take over- the (government, is a political matter.

And that

22

is what I read into the notion of overturning this Government

23

by force -and violence.

24

assassination of public officials, members of -the Congress or

I do not read into the notion of

is

25

other persons in positions of authority, for that purpose, I do
14

1

not read that as a political activity or as a political

2

belief which is subject to protection.,
Sorae years back,, unfortunately, we had, I suppose

3
4

what was then considered a form of the administration of

S

justice in the Western States and unfortunately other places,

6

commonly known as "necktie” parties.
Now, it is true, that when they had an unfortunate

7
3

individual strung up was suspected of having been a rapist?

9

suspected of having been a murderer, or whatever -- cattle

10

thief, whatever* you want to. term it, 1 suspect that you might

11

term that the administration of justice, but I don't believe

12

that you would terra it the administration of justice in the

13

sense that we are speaking of the administration of justice

14

today? and by that token, I do not believe that the notion of

15

violence, or violent overthrow of the Government of this

16

country, for the very purpose of destroying it, is a political

17

belief.

If so, someone smarter than 1 will have to convince

MR. WILMER:

Yes.

I would not raise the point that it

5

MR. JUSTICE 'WHITE:

I would not raise that,

Was there any indication at

6

any time during these proceedings, at least until it got to the

7

Supreme Court, that there was a refusal to answer Question 27

on the grounds of self-incrimination?

I would have to say, Your

Honor, my recollection is thatprobably it was raised.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

The Fifth Amendment was raised,

as her grounds for refusing to answer the .question.
MR. WILMER:

I think it was.

Mr. Baird, I am sure,

can qualify my answer one way or the other, but my rec©i~isc<„.ion
is that in discussions with Mr. Allen and in related matters,
at least it — the point was brought up, that this amounted to
incrimination —
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

But it was urged in fee Supreme

Court of Arizona?
MR.WILMER:

Your Honor, the problem with that is

that there is a brief — relatively brief petition filed? the
relatively brief response with the memorandum and the argument

MR. WILMER:

Amendment situation, if it pleases Mr. Justice White.

18

I think that that case is not readily distinguish­

I don’t like to Use this illustration, but I can

19

think of none more apt, and that is this:

In Arizona,

20

Massachusetts, Florida, Washington, we have what is called

21

dog racing-? and in that, particular activity, which is a para-

22

mutual betting situation, dogs that have never run before are

23

called "schooledi”

In other words, they are run through the

races as if it was a race; the time is recorded — the whole
thing is recorded, just like any race track habituee would desire
17

1

to know about any dog or horse.

And based on that, when they

2

do start running they are catalogued.

3

Now, the reason is, you have a track record? you

4

have something to go on,, and those that are put on the track

5

and have run, have already established themselves.

0

therefore, that when someone comes who does not have a track

7

record, as to whom we have no background, then rightfully, a

8

different rule should apply than from a lawyer who has been

3

admitted to practice, has established his reputation or his

Mow, I say,

10

ability, rather, to practice; who has, in all things, carried,

11

bin such that, the Bar may properly criticise him; and therefore

12

I say that when we say that a lawyer who has been admitted 'to

13

practice, who is a practicing lawyer, should be permitted to

14

take the Fifth Amendment.

15

from the applicant who is a raw product, if I may use that

expression, whose qualifications and whose future ability is

I would readily distinguish that

18

entitled to ask many questions we probably should not and could

19

not ask an admitted lawyer.

20

How, 1 would just say in closing, if it please the

Court, that there are some very sound reasons for the finality

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN*

Could I ask you a couple of

questions, perhaps, here.
MR. WXLMER:

Certainly.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

Perhaps they are a little

outside the record, but I think it's appropriate to ask them,
notwithstanding that, for whatever they are worth.
In light of what you say your standards would be
if Mrs. Baird had answered this question., going further and
satisfying yourself that this was something more than belief
in the abstract sense, have you ever* asked your court to change
the form of that question to incorporate those elements in it?

No, but I think perhaps this might be

an indication wo should. Your Honor.

As I say, these are old,

X am not at all here defending them; I am

simply saying that these are what we live with.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

The second question I wanted

20
21

22

to ask you is that this litigation pending, what is the fate of
that question in its present form now.

Are applicants refusing

to answer it, or ere you holding up or are they answer it; or
what *.s going on?
MR. WXLMER:

Your Honor, they are most of them-

answers to Question 25? is that correct?
MR. WXLMER:

No, Your Honor? but X would not make

a point of that, because my recollection is that Mrs Baird

10

did answer it; if she hadn't answered it we would have made a

point of it; X cannot recall in detail what bar answer was, but

12

I know it satisfied us, or we would have pursued it further.

13

And my r-v >llection is she did list quite a number of organiza­

14

tions , but it is not here and
MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Would there be any objection

15
16

if we — from either of you to supplementing this record, if

17

this is an admitted fact that she answered them, to submit the

18

answers?

1®

20

For myself, I'd like to see the record supplemented

that way.
MR. WILMER:

No, if I had realised it, we would have

21

had it here, Your Honor; but we would be very happy to supply it

22

ourselves; Mr. Baird can supply it? whatever is convenient.

23

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Would she have been required

24

in answering Question 25, to state that she had been a member

25

of the Communist Party if she had?
21

1

MR. WILMER:

2

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

3

Yes.
That was required by Question

25?
Well, obviously, the question —•

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

We can proceed on the assumption

that she has been asked if she belonged to the Communist Party
andhas said "no.”
MR. WILMER:

We would accept it on its face value,

'unless something had come up.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

Of course your question is a

little broader than that? it is not only the Communist Party,
but other subversive organisations.
MR. WILMER: Correct.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:

And therefore, I suppose her

failure to answer the party wouldn't necessarily have set at

rest the relevancy, if this question is proper in 27, so that
you don't have to ferret through and find out which of the

organisations may be subversive and so forth.

MR» JUSTICE BLACK:

Now, I want to ask yon a

3

question about that, in view of your answer to the query about

4

it.
When she was asked to state all the organisations

5
6

she belonged to since she had been 16 years old- was that

7

asking to state whether she had been a Communist, just the same

8

as 27 was?
MR. WILMER:

9
10

My interpretation of that question,

Your Honor, is really that it is a duplication of 27.

11

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

12

MR. WILMER:

13

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

14

MR. WILMER:

15

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

16

That it is a duplication.

Yes;-And that she did answer?

She did answer 25.
She stated the things she said

she belonged to.

17

MR. WILMER:

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

19

I am sure that is right. Your Honor.
I think you have just

one minute left, Mr. Baird.
MR, BAIRD;

20

For one minute I'll take.

I would like

21

to respond to Mr. Justice White’s question about the Fifth

22

Amendment.

It was raised in a letter to Mr. Wilmer and the

Committee.

This is part of the records it is in June 27, 1968

23

24
25

in the form of.a letter where Spevack versus Klein was dis­
cussed and there was’a memorandum attached to that where the
23

i

application of the Fifth Amendment to the Bar admission
process was discussed and in Mr. Wilmer's brief there was a
statement that she did not assert the right of self-incrimina­
tion, but tills is in a letter dated July 31, 1969 that Mr.
Wilmer sent to Mr. Davis, the Clerk of this Court, saying that
that was an incorrect statement, that in - rt, she has asserted
the privilege and —
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:
MR. BAIRD:

~

Pardon me?

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:
MS. BAIRD:

Of what?

Privilege of what?

Against self-incrimination? the Fifth

Amendment right.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Was it at the time she answered
this question a crime against the Federal Government to belong
to an organisation which pledged to overturn the Government by
force?
MR. BAIRD:

By a literal reading of the Smith Act,

I would say yes.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:
MR. BAIRD:

But she answered Question 25.

Answered Question 25.

MR. «JUSTICE WHITE:

Why didn51 she refuse to answer

that one?
MR. BAIRD:

Because we were required, Mr. Justice

White, under Konigsberg and Anastapl© to answer that question
which calls for the names of organizations.
24

She was specifice.il

pr

1

2
3

directed by the mandate in those cases, we believe, to answer
that kind of a question.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Suppose Question 25 said,

4

"State whether you are a member of the Communist Party and also

5

state all other organizations of which you are a member; would

6

you have had the right.to assart the.privilege in any respect?

7

Anastaplo require, at the pain of —
MR» JUSTICE WHITE:

groups in that category that she has already listed —
