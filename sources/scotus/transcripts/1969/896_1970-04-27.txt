ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

No. 896, Wyman vs.

MR. WEINBERG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

May it pleast

the Court:
This appeal raises the question whether, in a time
when urban problems are recognized by virtually every thoughtful

10

person and every social commentator examining American life to

11

be of the most serious proportions, the State of New York may

12

not employ its concededly limited resources in the field of

13

social welfare in such a way as to address itself to these

14

problems with slightly greater emphasis.

15

131~a of the Social Services Law of New York, which

m

is the statute this case is all about, provides levels of wel«

17

fare allowances for welfare recipients in the State of New York.

18

It was enacted by the 1969 Legislature and, as I am sure the

19

Court knows, itj was the same statute that was involved in

20

Rosado vs. Wyman, which this Court decided on April 6.

I

I

21

Section 131®a establishes levels at one rate to wel­

22

fare recipients within New York City, and at a slightly lower

23

rate, approximately $5 a person, for welfare recipients living

24

outside New York City.

25

Commissioner Wyman, the State Commissioner of Social Services,

It then goes on to give the Appellant,

3

1

discretion under an amendment which was passed prior to the

z

effective date of 13i^ag which was July 1, 1969, discretion to

3

increase the payments in any county upon the request of that

4

county

5

facts warrant, and prior to the effective date of the statute

6

Commissioner Wyman did indeed exercise that discretion and he

7

halved the differential between the few York City welfare pay­

8

ments and the welfare payments in the suburban countiess in­

9

cluding Westchester and Nassau Counties, which are adjacent

03?

indeed without the request of that county,» if the

10

to New York, essentially suburban counties, and which are the

11

two counties in which the plaintiffs here reside,»

12

It has to be presumed, as the Court has stated on

13

many occasions, that ,fhe State Legislature acted within the

14

knowledge of local conditions and indeed the Assemblymen and

13

State Senators who passed this section of the Social Services

18

Law are elected from very small districts„

17

close to their local constituencies as any elected represents**

18

five can be*

19

sent less people than a Congressman, and they have to be pre­

20

sumed to be aware of local conditions0

They are about as

Their districts are much smaller and they repre­

21

Indeed,, it is noteworthy that the Assemblymen from

22

Nassau and Westchester Counties predominantly voted for this

Now —
Q

You are speaking now of the bill which estab­

lished the differentials, to recognize the higher cost of

living in New York City?
A

Yes, sirs which differential was, as I have

3

indicated, halved by the administrative action of Appellant

4

Commissioner Wyman before the; bill took effecte

5

Q

Halved»^ h«a®l«-v-»e»d?

8

A

Yes, sir»

7

Q

And what is the present case?

8

A

The 1970 Legislature reenacted section 131«a

9

with increased levels9 but they maintained the differential so

10

that the cast isnft moot»

11

cept that, as a. result of the very sweeping preliminary injur?.c>*

12

tions issued by the three»judge district court in tills case ,

13

the state is now paying the identical payments to welfare re»

14

cipients in the counties involved in this case& but that is

15

only because of the injunction»

IS

copy of which is next to our reply brief, which was then

17

superseded by a slightly different statuteg copies of which we

18

mailed to the court last week when it was enacted, still

m

maintains the differential, only the figures are slightly

20

different, they are higher, but the differential still exists,

21

except insofar as the preliminary injunction has eliminated it

22

for the purposes of this case»

23
24
25

Q

The differential still exists, ex»

But the '1970 legislation, a

The differentials are between New York City, on

the one hand, and all of the rest of the state, on the other?
A

Yes, sir»

j

!

Q

Is that fight?

2

A

Yes ? sir o

3

Q

And all the rest of the state is now treated

4

equally by statute0 subject only» as I understand it 0 to the

3

discretion to increase it up to a maximum of what New York city

6

pays?

7

A

Thatcs correct» Your Honor» except ■=>■=■

It used to be three areas in New York» as I

That’s rightc Your Honor«

And it was dene by legislation?

A

Exactlyo

Q

Now there are two under the statute» New York

before this present legislation?

City and the rest of the state» those two?
A

Except for the Commissioner's discretion which

he has exercised in eliminating the differentialt.

19

y

That I understand,,

20

A

And the Commissioner9 by regulation in 1969»

21

returned in effect to three districts^ or really four districts»

because New York City gets the statutory rate <=•■=>

A

25

Righto
the suburban- counties which were previously

locked in with New York City now get an amount slightly lower

Ii

:

1

than New York Gitye and the two other up-state districts are

2

administratively established at a slightly lower rate than the

3

suburban counties ringing New York City and also a couple of

4

apostate counties which were traditionally thrown in with the

5

suburban counties*,

6

subject only to the injunctions which have thrown the suburban

7

counties in with New York City*.
q

8

9

So now8 in effect

9-

there are four rates8

Does the question still remain* as it was be,’

fore, whether this is a reasonable classification on the part

10

of the Commissioner?

11

A

That is precisely the question* Mru Chief

C)

Whether it changes because you have fewer

12

Justice,,

13
14

classifications, the fundamental question hasn't changed

IS

your view?

18

A

f

in

No* sir,, under the Equal Protection Clause* it

17

is still a question of whether there is any rational basis for

IS

the differential0

19

adequate basis for that differentialp for the reasons which we

2Q

deduced before the three»-judge court and which I would like to

2!

expound on here,>

22

And* as we will show* there is more than an

It should be noted, before we turn to that* that

23

these payments don't include rent or fuel for heating* and the

24

record shows that the actual payments received by welfare

25

recipients in New York City for rent* which are paid over and

$84 a month«

6

one person, are getting $105 or $108 a months if my memory

7

serves 5 over $1OQ0 in any evente and in Nassau County the

8

record indicates that the maximum permissible payment for a

9

family of four is $155 or $160 a month,, depending on whether

Indeed, as the record shows here„ the average

The plaintiffs here9 who are single women, just

10

it is an apartment or a private house0

ii

double the average that is received in New York City»

12

due to rent control and0 I suppose, to the larger amount of

13

apartments available in New York City and the general squeeze

14

in housing in the suburban counties which have grown so

15

rapidly over the past years0

m

reasons, when discussing the actual benefits or allowances

17

received by welfare recipients, of which shelter is obviously

18

one cf the basic components, you have got to look not only at

19

the welfare allowance, which doesn't include shelter, but also

20

at the cost of shelterd which is also paid by the Commissioner0

2!

And since the costs of rental are so much less in New York

22

City, it averages out so that in fact these plaintiffs and

23

others similarly situated in Nassau and Westchester Counties,

24

are actually receiving as much money or perhaps more than

23

people in New York City0

we submit improperly, and certainly improperly in the light of

11

its way to determine ;the constitutional question adversely to

12

the state, as it happens, and we submit that reversal is re»

13

quired on that ground alone, over and above everything else©

I

14

This statute has to be viewed, whether we talk of

15

equal protection or the statute and regulations, in the context

16

of a statutory scheme in Mew York State which traditionally

17

treats Mew York City :as sui generise and indeed Mew York City

18

is a special casea

I

It is the urban megalopolis par excellence9 j
I

18

it comprises half the people in New York State and indeed more

20

than half of the welfare recipients, three-quarters, as the

21

record states, and throughout the statutes in New York we see

22

special treatment given Mew York City far in excess, I am

23

sure, of the special treatment given Chicago or Baltimore or

24

Philadelphia in the statutes of those states 0

Indeed, this Court itself, in Salsburg vs© Maryland,
10

|
i

2

remarked, quoting an earlier case.», Missouri vs0 Lewis, a 19th

2

Century case, that it would be permissible under the Equal

3

Protection Clause for New York State to apply the civil code,

4

the civil law to New York City, and the common lav to the rest

S

of the state if it wanted to®

6

Now, that sounds like hyperbole, but this Court said

7

it, and it quoted it in Salsburg vsc Maryland, which is a case

S

from the 1950®s«>

0

it is unique, and the Legislature has to be presumed to be

10

aware of that*

The fact is that New York City is different,

There are briefer bounds and specific examples«

S!

For example*, the multiple dwelling law, which pre­

12

scribes all kinds of requirements for apartment houses, only

13

applies to New York City*

14

which is entirely different, which applies to apartment houses

15

outside New York Gity0

16

Baldwin case,, which is before it, the entire structure of the

17

penal law, the Code of Criminal Procedure, is different in New

18

York City, and indeed this Court has before if the question of

10

whether New York State can permissibly within the Equal

20

Protection Clause give jury trials to misdemeanors outside

21

the city and not have them in New York City*

22

There is a multiple residence law,

As this Court knows well from the

Mow, whatever the rights and wrongs are there, it is

23

again illustrative of the fact that the New York Legislature

24

has traditionally treated New York City as a very, very dif«

25

ferent thing from, the rest of the state«

II

Now, when we look

*i

at section 131-ag we don°t see the enormous difference that we

2

find in these areas,, where you. are talking about giving jury

3

trials in one place and not somewhere else* or having stringent

4

requirements for multiple dwellings in New York City and not

5

having them in the other counties of the Statec
We are talking here about a very slight $5 a person

differential* which the Legislature* as I have said* has to be

presumed to be aware of the specific Local conditions0 saw tic

cost of urban living* which the. New York City welfare recipii

12

The question here* as this Court said* is whether the

13

grounds adopted by the Legislature are wholly irrelevant to the

14

staters objective a

15

so wholly irrelevant * then it plainly has to reverse» it

16

c&ppGHSrS a

And unless the court can say that they are

18

Now, let Idjlook at the grounds0 These grounds are.
i
specific and factual» They are not policy grounds» and yet in

19

Dandridge this court saw fit to declare that the maximum family

20

rule in Maryland* which created a real difference* a sizable

21

difference in the amount of welfare benefits received by indi­

22

viduals* depending on whether or not they were in a large

23

family* it held that .that was a permissible exercise of

17

;

24

Maryland8s legislative discretion* based solely on Maryland8s

25

policy grounds0

Now* here we don*t have policy* we have
12

**

actual factual material©
For example® we have the rent control and the actual

2
•o
w

lower rent within New York City® which I have already alluded

4

too

In addition® as the record shows® and a study on housing

S

in New York City shows® because of rent control and because of

<©

the antiquity of much of the housing in areas where welfare

7

recipients live® there has been an enormous deterioration in

8

the quality of that housing® and realistically the Legislature

9

was entitled to find that this entails the purchase of items

10

necessary to maintain this deteriorated housing® which might

11

not exist in a suburban area©

This

true . that New York

are reported9 but certainly not every stolen welfare check is

2

reported,, and stolen goods and monies undoubtedly are not

3

reported in the majority of cases.

4

other devices that are necessitated by the high crime rate

5

are simply a fact of life to a New York City slum dwellerf and

6

it is no doubt debateabie whether the Legislature should give

7

Window gates and bars and

more money within its standard of need to compensate the New

8

York City welfare recipient for these problems„

9

concede that it is debatable„ then the Equal Protection Clause

!

But once we

three-'

10

doesn’t apply and it simply becomes a matter of what the1

11

judge court below did»in our judgment, in substituting its
♦

12

views on policy for the Legislature’s discretion in coping with !

13

the realistic problem before itB what this Court characterised

14

in Dandridge as the

15

extraordinary difficult problem of apportioning or parceling

16

out to welfare recipients all of whom obviously need whatever

17

the state can afford to give theme precisely how much the

18

state can give this one and that one„

19

the differential was extremely slight„ compared to the family

20

maximum which this Court sustained in Dandridge®

21

i

j

I

I am paraphrasing the Court8 but the

And here we repeat that

Another factor which the Legislature,, since it

22

enacted this act-, had to be aware of is the sales taxa and New

23

York City has a 6 percent: sales tax@ 3 percent state,, and an

24

additional 3 percent imposed by the city0

25

sales tax applies to the state law„ of course„ but in Nassau

J

items other than food which the welfare re­

a difference*,
In refer the Court in our brief to the fact that the

12

Internal Revenue Service, in its tax forms for the year 19695

13

saw fit to recognise that for a family with an income of be«

14

tween $4*000 a year g which is the income of the family of

15

four on welfare in New York* the sales tax allowable under the

16

suggested permissible allowances for its sales tax deduction

17

on income tax is $92 «for New York City for a family of four

18

with that income level* and only $46 in Westchester County*,

19

Now, right there you have got a $4 a month differential*, and

20

we are suggesting that this is necessarily binding on the

.23

Legislature or that they have to abide by that* but once we

22

concede that it is a debatable point* then, we have left the

23

Equal Protection Clause far behind in the area of legislative

24

discretion*.

Well9 I would like to read their brief that

way, Mr« Justice White, and if we pan read it that way, then I

15

think with all due respect that New York is home free, because

16

we have shown that there is that demonstable standard, at least

17

it is debatable and, once it is debatable, that regulation

18

certainly can*t impose any greater requirements on New York

“objective” and ’’equitable” and that can* t mean anything more

in

When

3

you look at the reasons for the slight differential

of New York City

5

valid reasons®

It had the deterioration of housings the higher

6

crime rate5, the higher sales tax, and one which was testified

7

to by the commissioner» which 1 didn*t get to yets and namely

8

the fact that the vast bulk* the overwhelming, preponderance of

9

welfare money is paid under the AFDC program, and that means

10

favor

we see that the Legislature in fact had

11

that most welfare recipients in New York,, as in other states8
>
have children® And where the social cost of urban living hits

12

home is to the child on AFDC living typically in New York Cit^9

13

unfortunately in a tenement :Ln areas remote from the park®

14

As our brief indicates9 there are huge areas in Bronx County

15

particularly which have a high number of welfare recipients.f

16

where there are simply no park around for miles, this neces­

17

sitates the parents taking the child on public transportation

18

and bringing him to a park or to the 200s and museums and

IS

aquariums and other facilities„ features which are available

20

in New York City, and which are part: of urban living®

21

Now, in the suburbs we are not about to suggest that

22

life in the suburbs where the AFDC child lives is rosy9 but

23

there is no room, around and the Legislature had a right to

24

find that a child on welfare in Nassau or Westchester County

25

is a lot more apt to have some kind of vacant lot around than

a child in a tenement and haul them over to South Bronxg and

Vie are not saying that every Member of this Courts

with what the Legislature said in every one of these instancess

But there has to be an ambit or a

scope of legislative discretion* and these are factual things

here»

12

successfully in the Dandridge case»

13

which the legislature' and the commissioner who has the

expertise and the corps of civil service people* the staff to

Q

Now* you lre back on the constitutional argument®

!S

A

I think they meld or dovetail* Mr® Justice

Douglas»

20

equitable* and when one reads that together with the statute.,

21

which speaks of the statewide standard of need* I think we are

22

roughly in the same territory as the Equal Protection Clause

23

which says that there has to be a rational standard for the

24

legislature»

23

The standard and the regulation is objective and

0

I don’t know if the equal protection was held
23

i

2

in that and, furthermore* the fact that you’re roughly equival­
ent doesn’t mean that you are there.
A

Sir 9 I agrees but I think that where the

4

legislature has the demonstrable standard„ the very language

5

that the regional commissioner of H.E.W. talked about9 that

6

both under the equal protection and the test under the regu«

7

lation is objective and equitable0 there exists an adequate

S

ground for the differential.

9

court didn’t look at it that way at all.

But we note that the three-judge
They bypassed the

10

statutory and regulatory grounds and, as we have indicated9

1?

they veered toward the constitutional grounds„ so right off

12

the bat it would appear that the sweeping injunctions granted

13

below have to be reversed«, but we submit that a remand for

14

the purpose of considering the statutory and regulatory ground

15

wouldn’t serve any useful purpose here® because the scope or

16

the ambit of discretion within which the. state legislature

17

is allowed under that test seems to be about the same as the

18

government in effect says in its brief$ as under the equal

19

protection clause,, and as their commissioner has said,,, to the

20

extent that there are demonstrable differences*, the differen­

21

tial will be justified9 as indeed they have justified differ­

point out that the injunctions granted below are not granted

on the statutory ground, which the three®judge court saw fit to

ignore*,

They were granted on the constitutional grounds and

11

the way they phrased their order, they are broader than what

12

this court permits„

13

example, in issuing an injunction where the only, ground is

14

statutory and not constitutional*,

15

Rosado, where there was a violation found of an act of Congress,

16

was to remand the case back to the district court to give New

17

York State the choice of letting federal funds go or of re®

18

drafting their statute®

19

court below didn*t do anything like that, for the good reason,

2Q

or at least for the reason that they didn:t take the statutory

21

route; they took the constitutional route®

22

I think this Court can pass on both the constitutional ground

23

and the statutory ground and find that, as this Court said in

24

Bandridge» that there isn®t anything special about welfare

25

11

this Court placed forward in the Rosado case»

12

is a point, this Court argued, to an articulation of the

That is there

3

standard of need which reflects social realities and cost re­

4

alities throughout the state,,

5

that is going to be cut back, at least the people of the state,

16

There is a point, because if

the legislature of the state, should know how much cutback is

7

actually going on and how fax short the state is falling..

8

That was the purpose of 402823»

I

19

suggest to you that the state, is free to cut New

20

York City back or move the suburban counties up, but it must do j

21

Q

Would ti

they have to ©aka some new objective

findings, or could they just take your brief and say, well, we
4

'i

2

surrender and we cut New York City back?
A

Wella Your Honor , the objective findings have

3

already been made by the appellant commissioner in his report,

4

and they have been made a gain 0 again and again, and they have

5

been made for years, that the cost of these items are the sarae0

6

They don't have to meet those costs, they can cut back, they

7

can pay a lesser percentage*

8

some kind of objective showing® seme kind of study, some kind

9

of consideration of the actual cost of these items, which shows

But unless they come up with

10

that the items vary in one region or another or are more or

11

less than one figure or another, they simply can't state that

12

New York City shall receive this amount and Nassau shall receive

13

some other amount*

14

I think what has taken place in this case is that

IS

what the appellants have done, and done clearly in terms of

16

their argument, is establish a different standard of need, not

17

a different cost, but a different standard of need for New

18

York City than for the. suburban counties*

19

any one of the arguments that they put forth, that becomes

20

quite clear*

21

And if one examines

For example, the primary argument cited in the find®

22

ing by the Legislature relied on by appellant below is that

23

there is a higher cost of social living in New York City which

24

requires transportation to daycare centers, to welfare centers,

25

to beaches, museums, to clinics, and so forth*
42

i

Answer:

What took place in this case and what is taking place

in this case is that the Legislature has seen fit to declare a

for the slightly higher allowance within the city for com­

with the fact that rents are paid specially according to

question»

X was taking

your statements of facts»
A

Well, taking my statement of facts, Your Honor®

21

X would rephrase the 'question this way»

I would say that

22

what New York State has done is average out costs of rents

23

throughout the state, average out the costs of all these other

24

basic need items, and presented it as one average sum for the

25

people of New York State»

That does not dens? equal protection,
49

1

even though some benefited more and some benefited less»

2

I would state that when Hew York State decides that it is going

3

to pay rent especially so that everybody has their full rent

4

needs paid, and then it is going t© take another sum and meet

3

other basic needs, and then it is going to pay up to 16 percent

8

more to people in New York City, because they donTt have as

7

much money to pay rent which they don’t need to pay rent, then

8

there is acme thing irrational about that*

But

'

Q

9

Well, 1 understand that as the advocate's argu*»

10

mente but let*© just stay on the rent for a moment„

11

think there is a rational basis: for a differential rental allow*

ance in New York City and other places?

areas?

average figures, that would be fins*

24

tion questions*

25

Ohs yes*

Well, it is not any more precise9 it

The commissioner has averaged figures for what they

They have chosen not to,

They chose to pay eht exact amount of
That doesn’t raise any equal protect

All we argue is that, having chosen one method or the
SO

\

i

other to pay rent* to then state to the people upstate that®

z

because you have a higher rent cost than people in New York

3

City havee we are going to give the people in New York City

4

16 percent more to buy things which we are tot allowing you to

5

buy since we are not giving you any money to buy with®, doesnst

6

make any sense at all*

7

Nowc I argue® Your Honor» this Court need not reach

6

that question in terms of equal protection»

9

of judgment as to rationality and whether <=»» how much deference

That is a question

10

is going to be given to the legislative judgment on this*

11
12

terms of the statutory requirement of statewidenesss the
*
violation, is clearv It is clear* The problem» 1 think» on

13

appellantes part occurs because they confuse the standard of

14

minimum rationality for equal protection and the standard under

15

the H.EoWo requirements of uniformity and they confuse them,

IS

badly anda therefore® don't address in reality the standard of

17

uniformity*

I would conclude„ Your Honor® that we could engage in

Do you think the federal act requires equal

Statewide® yes® unless there is a variation, in

In the costs*.

Yes »

you understand the United States* position ft© be* that there is

11

there is variation in cost?
A

As I -understand it* the United States* position*

12

which will be stated by the United States shortly* is this:

13

First* they have established a different standard for New York

14

City* since they are allowing for different kinds =*<*>

13

Q

Is thatyour position*

16

A

That is

17

Q

And what is the different

18

A

too?

our position»
standard?

The different standard is that they are allow®

19

ingj by their own language* monies for transportation, to day®,

20

care centers* social welfare centers and so forth for the

21

people of Hew York City* which they are not allowing elsewhere*

22

even though by their own testimony the people elsewhere have

23

those very same needs»

24

Q

25

miscellaneous

Well* in the standard of need is there some
.category or is every item listed?
52

1

A

Well* the principle of standard of need allows5

2

as H.E.W. sets forth© in simplified methods», allows the state-

3

to combine a wide variety of items*

not combine and listed individually©

But those combined items

They give one overall sum for that©

How would it ®«. let’s assume that laundry costs

the same in Mew York City as in Nassau County per person, or

10

however

11

shirts get dirtier in New York City©

12

reflected in this?

13

suppose, mors for laundry©

each shirt costs the same©

A

14

IS

Another thing' is that
Mow, how would that be

You could still pay the New York City, I

You could increase the standard by showing that

shirts get dirtier in New York City©

IS

Q

17

A

IS

In the past. New York did

City, yes

Increase the standard, is that
You could increase the standard for New York
the standard, by the amount reflected

19

Q

YOu have got to pay them for laundry

20

A

Oh, you could create a special

«*«

needallowance

21

for laundry, which is allowed under the H0E„W0 regulations and

22

which pretty much used to be the case in New York City©

23

only point which is relevant about that that I see to this case

24

la that if you create a special allowance for laundry, let’s

25

say $10 a. month maximum, dependent upon how much need you
SB

The

a

statewide so that people "sh© live in Buffalo and work near or

live- near a steel mill in Buffalo who also happen to have that

same need can also get the shirts washed*

it can ba shown

Yes» but what if you don't have it in Nassau

County?

Then we are not going to listen to the argument

costs in particular «»*»
Q

tf© might on a

body

I am not interested in •=»“> can you argue some»

else's rights under these ••
A

I think welfare recipients can and ought to ba

20

in a position to argue that when their grants are cut back» as

21

they were cut back under section 131«ae to below what New York

22

State had prescribed previously as the absolute minimum and

23

necessary for survival» and then welfare recipients in one part

24

of the state are further cut back up to 16 percent more» up to

25

16 percent more» then recipients in another part of the state»
54

1

welfare recipients have something very vital at Issue®

2

that vital matter may not result in the need for a special

3

standard of local protection., as'this Court noted in Dandridge*

4

but it does require some sort of attention to the rationality

5

of the procedure 9 and I think that issue is there*

6

court.concluded that it violated minimum rationality as well

7

as special scrutiny* but it certainly violates the statute*

Now*

The lower

S

8

That is what is at issue here*

Q

Suppose the State of Haw York Legislature made

10

a legislative judgment that helped relieve the congestion in

11

the cities 3 that they would have equal rates all over the state*

12

the same in Poughkeepsie and whatever your northern most towns

13

are8 the small towns9 that is in Hew York City* even though

14

they acknowledge the differential in cost* but they did this

15

deliberately to get people to move out of the cities as a

16

matter of public policy?

17

A

Yes*

Do you think that would be permissible ?

I think •>■=• perhaps l misunderstood part

18

of Justice White*s question*

19

lated„ and 1 will try to answer Xit more fully now*

20

two contrasting situations*

I think these questions are re»
There are

Contrasting situation number one*

'3

21

which is what we allege took place here* is the creation of

22

two separate standards for two parts of the state; or® part

23

put on a lower basis* without any relation to actual costs in

24

another* part*

25

Situation number two* which may also raise a
55

1

uniformity question* would arise where one. uniform standard is

2

created throughout the state* even though it is quite clear

3

that in one part of the state that uniform standard is totally

4

insufficient to meet the cost

5

which it does need* because of the actual cost situation in

6

another part of the state®

7

of the items of basis needy

We suggest that it is consistent with the principle

8

of uniformity to average costs and apply a uniform standard

9

statewide*

HaE<,W0 has said* out of its experience* that costa

10

outside of rent just don81 basically differ within most states

II

and therefore some objective showing ought to be made»

12

an objective showing is made* the costs really differ and

13

differ in a very significant extent* and the uniform state

14

standard is not arrived at by an averaging principle but simply

15

by taking the lower place as the standard and subjecting the

16

people who live in the very high cost place to that* then I

17

think there would be a uniformity issue raised„

18

19

But If

Now* Your Honor* in terras of the soundness of legis*»

20

lafcive policy involved* X think that is an issue in the first
f
instance for the United States Congress? And it seems to Die

2!

that with thirty «five years of a Social Security Act* which is

22

administered by H*E®W«* has followed the uniformity principle*

23

the United States Congress may be said also to follow this

24

uniformity principle* and this principle is critical*

25

critical and important for public assistance administration*

for

8

now I just want to say a few things rather briefly to get down

9

what seems to me9 seems to the United States to be the central

10

11

feature of this case*
First. I think it is by new clear that the only issue

12

in this case is the preliminary injunctions a preliminary in®

17

strictly in the terms of Mru Justice liar lair e opinion for the

Court in Rosada* if the state wishes to continue receiving

19

federal funds9 then it must order its needs standards in such,

20

a way that it is done on an objective* rational basis* which*

our submission* is the requirement of federal law and no more*

It is not & requirement for
It is not an injunction, for

The injunction tells the State of New York*

Second* X think again to clear up a point which has

23

been raised here* it is fundamentally our belief

24

put it in the probability terms* which are all that are re«*

25

quired here on preliminary injunction ®«= that the appellants
57

and X will

1

have shown that ip. all probability New York State is applying

2

two different standards of need* one for New York City© which

3

includes the social costs of living in

tion and visits to museums and beaches9 and possibly laundry

costs and lock costs* end a number of other items* and another

standard of need for the rest: of the state* in which residents

if they live in a ghetto in Yonkers or in Buffalo* there is

simply no allowance for them for these itemsw

13

position of H«E.W0 that the standard of need is a standard of

14

services* not a standard of money necessarily* and the obliga®

tion of the state is fco determine for itself* and they have

16

great latitude in doing so* what services are required as a

17

minimum for living in that state*.

services are required* than they may cost those services * and

because welfare recipients may

Whan they determine what

they may do so* as Mr* Sparer has suggested* on one of two

20

bases:

21

average of those costs throughout the state or they may do

22

on a regional basis*,

23

pense* the locks in New York are considerably greater than the

24

average expense in Buffalo* or certainly than the average ex®

into account in deciding how much to pay in those regions»

But it must make provision, if it is going to provide

3

that these things are available$ it must make provisions for

their availability on a statewide basis»

K

Chief Justice, that really provides the answer to your rent

6

question»

7

would think it is a wise judgment, although not a necessary one

8

<=**• that the costs of rent are so variable in different parts of

9

the state that it would be unfair to treat them as an average

10

11

And I think, Mr»

New York has made the judgment

X. for myself,

and9 therefore, they treat them on an individual basis»
But in terms of the standard of need, what is import**

12

ant is that every one in New York State ha© the right to rent»

13

It doesn®t matter whether you live in Buffalo or New York City

or Nassau County, you have a right to rent»

on an average basis, you could have it on an individual cost

basis, but you have the right to that service»

17

You could have it

What New York City is doing in this case, we submit,

18

is to say that only people who live in New York City have a

19

right to go to the beach* and only people who live in New York

20

City have the right to an allowance for transportation, and

21

only people who live in Hew York City have the right t© an
