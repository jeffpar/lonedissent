yesterday mentioned that he would accept the measure of in­

Q

Purely administrative?

A

Purely administrative.

25
18

And, as I pointed out

1

yesterday, this matter of whether or not this statute which

2

allows this transfer is unconstitutional should be attacked in

3

that way, rather than attacking the juvenile court system

4

through this vehiclee

is by virtue of a separate statute which is not at issue here,

Q

The fact thathe is in the penal complex

He is now in a penal institution where a man

or woman, who is an adult, would be if convicted of forgery?
A

Yes,

The basis for the transfer is a matter,

the statute sets out if they become incorrigible they can be
transferred.
Q

And it was based on this that he was transferred,
As you terminated yesterday, I think you were

12

making the points nowhere in this case is there any attack on

13

the validity of this administrative process by which he was

14

transferred out of a juvenile detention establishment into an

15

adult penal institution?

16

A

That is correct, Your Honor,

17

Q

And 1 think your point was, and you have just

is

made it again, that, if anything, is the correct attack by

19

collateral proceedings?

20

A

Yes, by habeas corpus there at. the penal comp­

21

lex to test the sufficiency or constitutionality of this

22

transfer, rather than through the juvenile jury system.

23

Q

While we have you there «**■* although it probably

24

is not relevant here

was there any kind of hearing in the

25

administrative process of making this transfer from one
19

1

institution to another?

2

A

Yes, there is a hearing within the Board of

A hearing of sonte kind?

A

The Department of Public Institutions,

Pardons.

a hearing that determines this.

11

This is an institutional hearing held in the

peritentiary?

It is

A

I am not certain just where they hold it.

I air

not familiar with this part of it but 1 will assume they hold
it at the training school at Kearney„ where the boy is.

12

Q

Did they have an outsiders there?

13

A

I don't know.

Q

If all the hearing amounts tc is the warden

they release them.

Is there a statutory maximum?

The longest period of time they can be

And this subsequent transfer to the adult

of the term of his custody?

that they could# but I wouldn’t be certain.

They can only commit them for a term of two years

In any event# it is your submission that now is

not before us in this case?
A

19

This is my contention# 'that this is another

matter which should be taken up.

is the matter of the benefits which a child receives from a

But on the other side of this

right off as a basis for the transfer.

from his home and placed in some other home, ba it a state

Q

The fourth category provided by the statute of

your stats seems to be a child in need of special supervision.

So far as the benefits of not having a

jury trial in juvenile court are concerned, the two main
things are the promptness of the disposition and avoiding the
trauma of a public hearing.
So far as the- prompt hearing is concerned, a jury
trial in and of itself is a delay»

Just simply setting tip a

jury trial where, in addition to the people, involved in the

24

i

thingr you must get either six or twelve other people at a

certain place at a certain time.
The District of Columbia does have provision for a

jury trial in their proceedings,

according to Judge Miller9s testimony before the Senate, they

were approximately 10 percent of the juveniles that asked for

a jury trialT and tills ten percent asking for a jury trial has

caused approximately a six-year backlog in these trials,

I might point out that

‘That was because they only handled 40 a year»

wasn't it?

Yes- sir,

I didn't see any

explanation for the reason

they can only hold one a weak,

I would assume it is because of the other

business of -die court that they can only schedule one per week,

Q

You are speaking now of on® jury trial?

59

A

Yes» siri one jury trial per week,

20

O

While -fchey are doing one jury trial a we«*k

they are doing a multitude of other nonjury trials?

21

Q

22

Could that be remedied by more courtrooms»

more judges?

23
24
23:

i:

A

This is what the judge was asking for,

Q

That can be remedied by money?

25

A

1
2

Yes, by increasing it.

There were approxi­

mately 2300 cases that were handled during this year,
Q

If it was a thousand it could be handled by

3

A

Yes, this is true.

6

Q

The other point, what about the fact — is it

3
4

money?

1

not true that all of these benefits that accrue from the stan­

8

dard juvenile court proceedings — isn*t it possible that the

9

juvenile or his lawyer or his parents could waive the jury

10

trial ami accept all those nice benefits?
A

II

This presents a problem*

It was pointed out

12

here yesterday that in Colorado where they allow jury trials

13

that there were only two over a period of time.

14

believe this was prior to Gault, and the attorney was injected

15

into the juvenile court proceedings.

16

C

18

A

20

21
22

23
24
25

Since that time there

have been more and more juveniles with an attorney.

M

19

However, I

But they could waive it?
Yes.

Well, this presents a problem, Your

Honor.
Q

As I understand it all of this is for the

benefit of the juvenile.
A
Q

Yes, sir.
And if the juvenile wants all of that benefit,

he can. get it by not asking for a jury trial? am I correct?
A

He can get it by waiving the jury trial, by ~
26

Q

1

What's wrong with allowing' him to have a jury

trial if he wants to waive all those benefits?

2

A

3

This brings up the problem of how dees he

4

waive it?

How does a youngster waive it?

Attorneys are

S

becoming more and more hesitant about waiving for a youngster?
because of the fact that he will discuss it with the youngster?

s

and the youngster will say. later? ®X didn’t understand.55

7

Q

S

Well? is it possible that they would also

discuss it with 'the parents?
0

10

n

A

1 would say ™“

Q

Isn't that the usual thing?

The juvenile? the

parents and the lawyer? right?

12

A

Yes? Your Honor,

Q

And

13
if they decidethey

want ajury

and they

n
want to give up these benefits? what's wrong with that?

15
A

I don't knot'/ that they would be giving up the

16
benefits of the court by asking for a jury trial,

1 don't

17
think that this would necessarily be so.

18
Q

Because after the trial the judge could still

W
give him all of these benefits.

20
At

Oh,

yes,

21
Q

I'm not talking about the constitutionality of

22
the claim for the jury trial., I'm just talking practically.

23
There is very little problem there? is there?

24
A

The

problem is that

25
27
IS

the attorneybecomes

I

hesitant about waiving because can a parent waive for a child?

2

Or does the child have to understand; it*s the child that has

3

to —

4

Q

Well, in the regular proceeding, isn't it

3

normal for the judge to ask the parents about what they think?

6

Not that he5s bound by it “~*

7

a
9

A

In our proceedings, at least they are.

The

matter is discussed with the parents and with the child.
Q

So, they find the juvenile delinquent and the

10

judge talks it over with the parents and says, ”2 really don't-

tt

think anything will be aided by putting this koy^Sway," and I

n

would do what I would normally do.

Nothing is lost but money.

A

I'm not sure I follow you, Your Honor,

Q

I said I don't 'think anything is lost but the

cost of 'the state of summoning the jury.

A

If

What else is lost?

oa a number of these there can be a long

delay during the period when they are readjusting for 'this,
these things can't happen immediately.

During this period of

time something has to be done with 'these youngsters.

At this

time they are in their formative years?, they are in -the period
of time when they are forming themselves for later life and by
not correcting the thing immediately or as close to the time
of the inciderit, you are really doing damage to the child,
rather than helping him.

You are hindering the child? you are

burdening the child with something he should®t be.
25

28

You are

1

burdening him with a delay that is really bad for him.
Q

But which he, his family and his lawyer agrees

that they want,

Is this right?

Ism not sure — I don’t

I would say it

just the same judge with a different hat on? is that correct?
A

11

Yes.

There we use the comity judge who serves

It was touched upon, Your Honor.

I don’t

20

believe the Court's opinion mentioned it, but it was simply

21

touched upon'in the argument„

22

Q

23
24
25

A

The closest 'thing to it is the Fugate vs ’Ronin

case where they say that the prosecutor has absolute discretion

31

1

in it, which is

2

Q

Standard list discussion.

3

A

Yes* which is the basic concept of the United

4

States, that the prosecutor has discretion as to what he will

5

file, whether it be a misdemeanor, felony, or what it may be.

6

So far as other jurisdictions which

or other

7

people may feel that a jury trial should not be had, there are,

8

of course, 34 states which do not provide a jury trial*

9

of course, the District of Columbia, as I mentioned before, does

And

■10

have a jury trial provision and at the present time there is a

1!

bill in the House and in the Senate which is supported by the

12

United States Attorney GeneralSs Office, which among other

13

things, eliminates the provision for a. jury trial for juveniles

14

The Presidents Crime Commission Report —» in their report they

15

state that they do not feel that a jury ferial serves any pur/
pose in a juvenile proceeding*

16
17

The Uniform Juvenile Court Act does not provide for

13

a jury trial and the Model Rules for Juvenile Court, which was

19

prepared by the National Council of Juvenile Judges, does not

20

provide for a jury trial in a juvenile court.

21

22
23
24

25

Really, one other problem that you have in connection
with a jury trial for — in a juvenile court, is the matter of
finding a jury of peers*

Really, the juvenile judge who, by

dealing with these children all the time, is less apt to be,
shocked by the long hairj by the mannerisms? the things that

32

the children do,, than the average person, from off the street.

16

Would you think that situation would be a desirable

A

Mr. Justice, itss obvious that there will be

17

situations wtere the child is adversary to the parent and it

18

existed in this case.

19

Q

The child®s adversary to the father,

I think it was suggested by either Mr, KuM-maH

20

or Mr, £ canIan that this might be a very, very large propor­

21

tion of all the juvenile cases coming before the courts? who

22

are not responsible people, hence do not have the relationship

25

of trust and confidence of the child for whom they would be
called upon to waive the jury.

I think certainly — I donst know what
42

the percentage would be* but if itEs as high as 25 or 30 per­

2

present a problem.

who, after all, is the lawyer for the juvenile, not for the

6

parents .

7

Inthat case, it would seem to me that the

8

between tha juvenile and the parent he has to go with the

9

juvenile.

Now, if he’s retained and being paid by the parents

10

to defend the child, there can be problems.

A

Well, he might have to take on some guardian

24

views his responsibility differently in dealing with a juvenile,

25

I think there is a built-in less adversarial feature about it.
43

1

I think that the average lawyer wants fco do something for the

2

child and doesn’t view it in a hard-core,, adversary fashion

like you have to with some adults.

7

What do you think the Constitution means by a jury of peers?
