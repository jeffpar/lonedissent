the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

This case is concerned with a single aspect of the

!0

proceedings under a. voluntary petition for corporate reorgani­

?r

sation originally filed in 1954 pursuant to Chapter 10 of the

12

Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor, Hancock Trucking Corporation.

In the petition Hancock alleged that it was unable tc
meet its debts as they became due and requested the appointment
of a trustee to operate the business and manage its property.
The Respondent here is that trustee.
The claims of the United States against-the debtor
are for unpaid income, withholding, employment and excise
taxes in the total amount of more than $375,000.

Because of

the narrow focus of the questions presented by the Government’s
petition for certiorari, little of the lengthy history of these
reorganisation proceadings need be recounted here.
The issues in this Court concern an amended plan of
reorganization filed by the trustee in June 1967 and approved
by the Courts below over the government’s objection.
2

The

!

amended plan reflected an agreement approved by -he District

2

Court and by the Interstate Commerce Commission for sale of

The contested plan provides for an initial payment

4

!

of 100 percent of certain wage claims and certain state and

2

local tax claims , 2C percent of the claims of the general

3

unsecured creditors, which is all they will receive, and 10

4

percent of the government's tax claims and of the remaining

S

state and local tax claims.

6

The remainder of the amount due to the government ami

7

to state and local tax authorities was to be paid in 78 monthly

8

installments secured by an assignment of the note and chattel

9

mortgage Hennis had executed in its purchase of the debtor's

10

operating rights.

This amounts to initial payment, on the

$37,500, and 78 equal monthly installments thereafter of
approximately $4,330 each.

No interest was to be paid on the

monthly installments, which together with the initial payment
would simply total $375,400 owing to the government.
As we point out in our brief, at the time of the
initial payment when lower-ranking creditors were to foe paid
in cash, the discounted present value of the right to these
future payments to the government, plus the initial payment to
the government, would amount to approximately $317,000, soma
$58,400 less than the $375,400 owing to the government.
The government0 s position is that this does not
satisfy its priority rights, not because the- government has a
right to immediate payment of all eash\th&t is, on hand, up to
the limit of its claims in Chapter 10 proceedings, which we do

Q

You really wouldn't suggest that a secured

creditor does not have some priority in Chapter 10; would you?
A

It’s been held in equity reorganisation and

3

equity receivership proceedings that secured creditors,, at '

0

least the mortgagees» have priority ahead.of the government's

7

priority under 3466 and there has been disagreement about other

secured creditors.

G

All right, let's take mortgagees, then.

You

say they have priority under Chapter 10?
A

We believe that the standards of priority that

12

prevail in equity receiverships have been carried over into

*3

Chapter 10; yes, six*.

14

Q

Well, now, just take a mortgagee.

He's got .

15

priority over unsecured creditors.

16

mortgagee may not be: postponed in payment to unsecured

Would you suggest that a

creditors who, say, have been scaled down to 2S percent of
their claim?
Let's assume the plan calls for satisfying the
secured debt over a period of ten years.

But, unsecured

creditors are paid off when you value the property and you find
out what interest the unsecured creditors have, you find out
the only assets that are left for them are 25 percent.

25

percent of their claims are going to be paid, and they have the
cash to pay them and they decide just to get rid of them, and

i

they pay them off in cash in the plan but. secured creditors

z

who are going to be paid in full, are postponed for ten years.
A

3

Our understanding of the fair and equitable

4

rule is that if the secured creditors object to that they have

5

a right to insist on 'their payments being made first.

<3

7

Q

And that is essential to your case, isn't it?

A

It's not essential to our case, Mr. Justice,

because we have a statutory right in revised statutes.

8

Q

9

X know, but all you say that gives you is
•r

priority

1©

A

11

Moreover, we have an explicit right in Section

IS

199 of Chapter, 10 to object to the plan if it doesn't satisfy

13

our rights.

24

Q

Sure, you can object to 'the plan but then the

question is; what provision would be made for non-assenting

15

creditors and whether it's fair and equitable to do that?

16

But you don't claim that the use of 3466 gives you some kind of

17
18

29
2©
21

a priority that's different from other priority creditors?
Assuming it's applicable to this case, it does give you a
priority.

Is it any different priority than a secured creditor

has, for example?

.

22
23
24
25

A

Well, I think it's more explicit that it's a

right to have our claim first satisfied.

That’s the language

used in Section 3466. where there is no explicit Statutory
language giving the secured creditors such a right.
10

They would

1

have to draw their rights from judicial interpretations of the

2

fair and equitable rule in equity receivership proceedings,
'

3

and there, arguably, would be more leeway for the courts to

4

!
consider making exceptions to some of the rules that have been j

5

established in those proceedings *

6

7
8
9
10
11

Q

•>

I take it then, that you really do find it

essential t'o rely on 3466 in this case?

A

Not essentially, because we don't think we

received the full payments right granted in Section 199, since
the discounting of our claims was never —
Q

Except for that point, though, you aren't

12

just relying on being a priority creditor under Chapter .10 „

IS

You are relying on being a priority creditor under the other

14

section, 3466?

15

16
17

18
1©

2©
Z\
22
23
24
25

A

Well, we also rely on the idea that Chapter 10

grants two priorities only.

There are only two explicit

priorities in Chapter 10 and I'll turn to that right now.
One of them is reproduced on Section 43 of our brief.
That is Section 216s number 3, Subsection 3. "A plan of re­
organization under this chapter shall provide for the payment
of all costs and expenses of administration and other allow­
ances which may be approved or made by the judge.”

That is the

only statutory basis forth® priority for administrative ex­
penses in Chapter 1C.

The terminology used is the same ter­

minology used for the government's tax claim priority, that the

11

t

plan — the right is to have the plan provide for payment and

2

we believe that Section 199 which is the provision in Section

3

— in Chapter 10 which gives us our priority rights insofar an

4

they can be found within that chapter, also, in body and

§

notion of priority,

6

Everyone has assumed right along in the administra­

7

tion of Chapter 10 that administrative expenses are entitled

8

to be first paid.

9

Q

They do have that priority,

Well, the cases have

certainly adjudicated a

10

whole system of priorities? haven't they?

11

be set out in the statute, but the cases have certainly ad­

12

judicated, including administrative expenses?

13
14
15
16
17
18

A

And they may not

Well, no one, to my knowledge, has contested

that administrative expenses have priority.
Q

Or, nobody's contesting that you have priority .

A

That's just what is meant by priority that is

being contested here? that is correct.
Well, our claim is that as a priority creditor,

19

admittedly a priority creditor, the government cannot be

20

required, when the lower-ranking creditors are being paid in

21

22
23
24

26

cash, to accept a deferral-without-interest of a portion of its
payment? or to put the matter another way, we contend thatno
lower-ranking creditor can, over the government's objection,
be paid until the government's claims have first been satis­
fied, which is what we understand to be the normal meaning of
12

priority, in bankruptcy.

!

2

In the alternative, we do contend that the government

3

is at least entitled to interest from the time of the- payment

4

to the lower-ranking creditors untilthe time of the deferred

3

payment to it, to compensate .it for the deferral.
But, our principal contention is that the government

6

7

hs

8

risk that deferred payments will not materialize, but should,

9

instead, be paid first.
In making our contention we rely on several dif­

10
11

the priority creditor, should not be the one to bear the

ferent guidepostsi because, as I have already said, Chapter 10
.

12

does not include a specific, comprehensive provision setting

13

forth a hierarchy of priority as Section 64 does for ordinary

14

liquidating bankruptcy proceedings.

15

The more venerable source of the government’s

m

priority rights in this case is Section 346S of the Revised

17

Statutes, which is

18

the United States Code.

IS

Congress in the late 18th Century, which had their roots in

20

sovereign priority of the Crown.

21

on

page 41 of our brief and in Title 31 of
This provision originated in Acts of

the

The statute expressly provides that debts due to the

22

United States shall be first satisfied whenever, as is the

23

undisputed ease hero, the debtor is insolvent and had committed

24

an Act of Bankruptcy.

25'

Decisions of this Court., cited in our brief, have

13

I

established that tax debts owing to the United States , are

z

among those covered by the broad language of this provision»

3

The plan upheld,by the courts below plainly does not comply

4

with this statutory requirement that the government’s tax

5

claims shall be first satisfied and there is, on the face of

6

things, no reason why this provision is not controlling»

7

manifests the continuous Congressional policy that the claims

8

of the Federal Treasury and the important public needs to be

9

served by the funds in that Treasury are to be placed ahead

It

*0

of the also just claim of unsecured creditors who did business

n

with

tz

the debtor for profit»
In light of this important public purpose of the

n

priority statute, this Court has repeatedly said that only the

14

plainest inconsistency would warrant the finding of an implied

15

exception to the clear command of Section 3466»

This was said

16

most recently in the; United States Department of Agriculture

17

against Redmond, in Volume 330, U»S„

18
19

These considerations and others, led the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit toconclude five-and-a-half years

20

ago, in a thoughtful opinion by Judge Reeves, that Section

21

3466 is fully applicable to Chapter 10 proceedings.

22

United States against Anderson, which is discussed in our brief

23

and the same conclusion had earlier been reached by the Courts

24

of 24ppeals for the Second and Third Circuits in cases cited on

25

page 13 of our brief»

14

That’s

I
a

3

This Court has not previously had occasion to de­
cide whether this provision is applicable to Chapter 10.
The Court below came to the contrary conclusion that

4

Section 3466 is superceded by the provisions of Chapter 10.

5

And our contention is that the other courts of appeals ware

®

correct in deciding that this statute is entirely compatible

7

with Chapter

a

provisions of Chapter 10, themselves, in the light of their

9

legislative history arid as interpreted by this Court, indepen­

10 and we go beyond that and contend that the

10

dently provide a priority right for the government's tax

II

claims which the plan here did not satisfy.

12

The principal provision in Chapter 10 that is per­

13

tinent, is Section 199 on page 42 of our brief and the second

14

sentence is the pertinent language, beginning at the end of

15

Line 7 of Section 199.

16

chapter, the United States is a secured or unsecured creditor

17

on claims for taxes or customs duties"— the parenthetical may

18

be omitted “-"no plan which doss not provide for the payment

19

thereof, shall be confirmed by the judge except upon the accep­

20

tance of a lesser amount by the secretary of the Treasury,

21

22
23
24

25

"If, in any proceeding under this

certified to the Court?” followed by a proviso which is irre/

levant here.
Nothing in this language which gives the Secretary
the right to demand or to forego full payment is inconsistent
with the command of Section 3466 as to the relative priority of
15

that right to payment as

2

command of the government's claim shall he first satisfied*"

3

And the history of the evolution of Section 199 recounted in

4

’detail in our brief shows that Congress knew that Section 346S

S

had been applied in equity receivership proceedings involving

6

insolvent corporations and that, in enacting the «Statutory

7

successors to equity receivership, which culminated in Chapter

3

10, Congress manifested no intention to diminish the govern­

9

ment's priority rights and rejected a specific recommendation

10

that it do so, but instead, was concerned to provide for pro­

11

tection for the government in Section 199, not only as to ,

12

insolvent debtors, to whom Section 3466 applies, but more

13

generally as to all debtors involved in Chapter 10 reorganisa­

14

tions ,

15

against other claims*

"The

1

Of course, Congress also provided specifically in

16

Section 199 and its predecessor, that the Secretary of the

17

treasury may compromise the government's rights and in appro­

18

priate cases this enables the Secretary to contribute to

19

Chapter 10's objective of fostering rehabilitation of the

26

debtor, when feasible.

21

compromise did not imply that the rights themselves are dirrdniH

22

shed, and as 1 have already mentioned, on the face of the

23
24
25

But, the granting of this power to

statute, this language providing for payment is the only
language used when Congress wished to provide for a priority
right in Chapter 10,

16

And in any event, the contrast within Section 199

1
2

between payment and acceptance of the lesser amount shows to­

3

ns on the face of the statute that.the government's rights were

4

not satisfied in this case.
There is another basis for the decision of the court

5
6

below, namely the provisions ir Chapter 10 requiring that the

7

reorganisation plan be fair and equitable; that these pro­

8

visions do not leave each District Court free to give effect

9

to its own notioxis of what is fair and equitable

In this

10

field* the words "fair and equitable," are terms of art which

11

acquired' their meaning through judicial interpretations in

12

equity reorganisation proceedings.

13

held with respect to Chapter 10, unanimously, in an opinion

14

Mr. Justice some years ago.

That is what this Court

And, one aspect of the meaning of fair and equitable

15
16

is broadly stated that creditors of a junior class may not be

17

given something of value at the expense of non-consenting

ORAL ARGUMENT BY SIGMUND J. BECK, ESQ.

a

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BECK;

9

Mr. Beck.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10

Courts

It's always been ray view that all cases ought to be

!1

viewed in the light of their facts and certainly it's true in

12

this instance in an equitable proceedings.
The facts are more fully elaborated in cur brief, but

13
U

there are some highlights that S think should be brought out.

15

It's true that this case began in May of 1954»

16

plan was confirmed in 1957»

17

without going into detail, the reorganised debtor took over the

IS

assets and property from the trustee in June of 1958, and

19

began operating without control of the Court.

22
23
24
25

Under the terms of that plan,

In December of 1961 the trustee filed a petition for

20
21

The original

final decree.

The hearingwas to be held on that in Marcv of

1962.

In February of 1962 there became a change in the direc­

tors.

The corporation had had financial difficulties and they

then entered into a coitract of sale with Hennis Freight Lines
for $1 million, principal and interest included, over a period

18

1

s

of time of 78 months«
Prior to the hearing on final decree, three creditor,*;

3

who had corae into being subsequent to the reorganised debtor

4

taking over the assets, asked the Court to have the trustee

$

retake the property and assets, alleging insolvency..

6

took place? hearing was held and the court vested the trustee

7

with the assets and property of the debtor corporation.

8

Investigation took place; the trustee then moved to affirm the

S

contract of sale with Hennis.

11

This

The court affirmed that contract

in August of 1962.
It took three years for the Interstate Commerce Com­

12

mission to finally approve the sale.

14

invented was a sort of limited restriction.

a reduction of mileage.

16

should the ICC reduce the mileage then Hennis wouldbe entitled

17

to a reduction.

When it did approve the

The original contract provided that

There was a dispute between thetrustee and Hennis as
to what the price should be.

whereby the maximum amount of“the sale was to be viewed as

22

interest, payable over the same period of time; that in

23

addition, the trustee would offer in the plan a 20 percent

Now, bearing in mind -that it's a plan of liquidation,

12

something else comes into play here and that is: What would

13

happen in the event of liquidation?

I would like to bring up two matters ‘before I go --

Q

It is still a reorganisation plan.

16

A

It is still a reorganisation plan.

With a plan for complete liquidation.

18

A

That is correct.

19

Q

So, itcs just by the rules of Chapter 10 —■

20

A

No question about that; no question about that.

It is our view, however, Mr. Justice, that in valuing the

21

22

assets inthis case we obviously cannot value the assets on the

23

basis of a going concern, but only on the basis of liquidation,

24

the value of the asset which is being transferred,

-

23

Q

Well, there is no argument about that? is there?
20

!

A

No.

2

The Government takes as Its viewpoint that they are

3

entitled to absolute priority of the 3466.

4

stand what they mean by "absolute priority#" frankly.

Absolute priority is; set forth in the Case case.

A’

Mos t do not think so.

Why not?

Because 1 don't think that at that particular

Would you think then, that a plan could be

Q

Where is the priority in the statute for

A

There is no priority in the statute..

At this

what Congress has enacted, and it would appear that —

In a straight Chapter 10, I would say yes»

I would not disagree,

MR. BECK;

Mr. Chief Justice* you asked before the'

7

case.

8

they did not cite the case of Consolidated proceedings * was

9

that they based their decision:

visions of Chapter 13 which apply.

But that isn't — whether they are entitled fee

entitled to payment before a junior creditor. A

I don't believe there is any place in the Act

which says they must be paid before the junior creditor.

Welly is the United States a senior creditor;

A

6

I would say, in my view# whether the United

7

States is a senior creditor or a junior creditor, they are not

3

entitled to get paid before any other creditors receive any­

9

thing.

They are entitled to be assured of satisfaction and

assured of their payment and this is done in this instance

!0
n

Q

And you must take that position —*

%z

A

Oh, yes; I do.

I don't have any qualms about

taking that view.

■13

Q

u

That a senior creditor may be postponed in

payment for ten years as longas he is assured of being paid,

15

but junior creditors can be paid immediately?

16

A

1?

Nos junior creditors may not take something

from the senior creditor, but in this case they are not taking'

18

tB

anything from the senior creditor; in fact, they are giving

20

something up and that's what I think we have to show.
Q

21

Well, let's justtake the case where a senior

creditor is provided for in the plan by promise and security

22

that he will be paid in full ten years from the date of con­

Now, any trua' reorganization in­

would necessarily have to have a solvent corporation coming

Let me indicate to you the practicalities of this

and why I say this is true in this instance, and I could think

3

of many others where it might not be.
(Whereupon, two large charts were set up in the

This is the plan:

7

The plan provides for a total

payout of $925,600 under the plan.' That5s the total cost.

No one disagrees that the administration claims are entitled

10

The first distribution indicates what

18

20
21
22
23
24
25

The miscellaneous taxes, incidentally, some 30 other
taxing authorities, received this $14,000, or 100 percent.
Thus, these two» which would ordinarily, in bankruptcy, at
least, have the same established priority, are out of the way
in order to solve the problem.

Because, Your Honor, the 20 percent is a com­

10

Q

Counsel, if the United States is right on their

20

argument about the priorities, then these matters would become

21

irrelevant, because the wisdom of their challenging the plan

22

is not for us, if indeed, there is a priority?

2S
24
25

A

I contend that even with the priority they are

so bound by Sections 216(7} of the Act, which indicates that a
dissenting creditor can be satisfied by various means.
32

And in

I

?

this case they are satisfied by two weans:

2

the property has been sold with their rights of taxing to it.

3

And in this case the United States does not have a specific

4

lien against it.

Q

Novi1, there you are arguing the wisdom of it

A

No; I'm talking in terms of 216(7) and in talk­

again.

S

(1) the sale of

ing in terms of 216(7) which is part of — in the appendix to
our brief.

We8re talking in terms of the plan of reorganiza­

10

tion in this chapter "shall include and respect the creditors

11

generally, or some class of them, means or provisions for

12

altering or modifying their rights."

there under Chapter 10 for the very reason that we're here.

dissenting class of creditors could not. insist in being paid

17

20

ai
22
23
24

This 216 was placed in

out in cash as the old equity receiverships required.

A

However,

in the old equity receivership there was no way for this to
happen, because the senior creditors had to be paid out in cash
if they insisted.
We contend that that's what 216(7) is for and we
also believe that there is nothing that excludes the United
States as a claimant from the application of 216.

Now, this

is where we disagree with the government, and we contend that
this true in other cases, in other security cases where there
have been secured creditors on a particular piece of property,
there hasn't beers any question that other claimants could get

25

33

1

paid, and that the secured creditors rights would be altered

2

in one of the many ways of 216(7)„
Now, I think the big question here is the interest

3

4

question, because there we are talking in terms of a question

3

that Mr, Justice Stewart asked: are they getting a discounted

6

value?

7

they are not is because post-petition interest is not avail­

8

able to tax claims.

I contend they are not and the reason I am contending

And full payment of $375,000 now is not made by

paying installments that add up, arithmetically add up to that
sum over a period of many years.

That's not full payment.

Well, if Mr, Justice will allow me, 1 would say

this: I think the question is one of substance, not of fault.
If we wc

continue these proceedings and begin to pay out as

the monies come in then the United States will not receive
interest and it will receive its full principal as we go along.

/
There is nothing, as a matter of fact, even in the first seven
chapters of the Bankruptcy Act, which provide that the United
States must be paid before anyone else? it provides that there
must be provisions made for the payment of the United States.
34

Now, that, to rne, is the real crux of it.

talking in terms of substance or fault.
I would go further, of course, and that is this:

The government insists that 3466 applies.

held it did not.

I am convinced that 3466 does not apply in
I believe that Section 199 provides

the priority that the legislature granted the United States.

They indicated that this was tomake certain that the United

9

States was going to be paid its taxes and custom duties, and I

10

just don't think that that's the question.
Now, I don't even believe that there is a conflict

between U. S. against Anderson and this case.

debts.

We’re not talking about non-tax debts here; we're

talking about the priority granted by 199, because all of these
are taxes.

only for one reason:

if I am correct that the start of

these proceedings and continuing on is only one step in the way
and the Cyper case applies and the Edens ease applies and the
government is not going to be entitled to the interest on its
money.

And for that reason X contend that it isn’t a dis­
count and true, one more thing:

there isn’t any question that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY LAWRENCE G. WALLACE,

9

OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

It
12

13

MR. WALSACE:

I would just like to make two brief

points here, Your Honor.
In the first place, it seems apparent to us from

14

Counsel's own chart that somebody's taking something away from

15

the United States in this case, compared to what we would have

16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

had in a liquidated distribution where the initial payment
would have been $160,000; now it's $37,500.

It's not fair and

equitable under established principles for the priority claim­
ant to have to suffer the expense of giving something of value
to claimants with less priority.
- Q

Well, that rather begs the question; doesn't it?

I mean, you assume that the result must be exactly the same in
Chapter 10 as it is in straight bankruptcy, and that is the
question in this case.
A

Well, this is not ray assumption.
36

The contention

s

is being put by the Respondent that this is the appropriate

2

comparison.

3

I wish to point out also that, depending on the cost

4

of administration, perhaps the unsecured creditors would, in

5

fact eventually get more, so that sum really should be dis­

©

counted by the period of waiting for it in addition to taking

7

into account the risk thatit will not materialise and which

B

would be borne by the unsecured creditors in that situation.

9

Nov?, this Court has recognised in a recent opinion

m

of Mr. Justice White’s, Protective Committee against Anderson,

n

that in Chapter 10 there is an authority in the Secretary of

12

the Treasury to bargain, to compromise and that bargain and

13

compromise among claimants plays a very important role in accom­

n

plishing the objectives of Section 10 and while it may seem

is

that in this case we are arguing for a. rigid rule of priority

26

the fact is that it is the priority that gives the Secretary

M

the bargaining power to induce others to enter into these com­

18

promises and accomplish the objective.

19

20
2f

22

23

We did bargain previously and accept a plan in 1957
in this very case, which shared our rights with others.
Thank you.
Q

I don’t know whether this record contains it,

but is there any indication of what the discounted value of
the $375,00'? ! L paid over that basis?

I
X suppose it's somewherJ

24
25

in seven years, around $225,000 at 6 percent.

37

So, in effect,

!

the government is saying to us, I take it, that, as a matter

2

of judgment, laying aside the priorities, judging the equitable

3

aspect of the plan the government's preference is to get

4

$160,000 now than $225,000 over a period of seven years with

S

the attendant risks that they might get all of it*

6

A

That is correct, sir.

Or, our own contention

7

would have been that we should be paid now what was being paid

&

under the plan.

3

paid under the plan to the junior creditors, rather than this

We have the right to be paid what was being

being made under the plan and certain of those we had a right

12

to, if we insisted on it.

Q

We would look at the distributions

I suppose it's not relevant here, but from what

you have said before 1 take it that some plan less than the
distribution under bankruptcy, but more than the one offered
might have been acquiesced in by the government?
A

There is the authority to do that. We did pre­

viously acquiesce in such a plan in 1957 in this case.

At that

time that plan had rehabilitative purposes and that is a
factor in our acquiescence.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Q

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

The other Counsel stated to me that payment

there to the other creditors in that first line was a payment
in full, but it looks like over at the last line it was not a
payment in full; what is that?
38

1

Q

2

A

That was the other chart.
In the other chart I think his contention was

3

that eventually there would bepayment in full, even though the

4

initial payment was only 10 percent.

5

our right is satisfied so long as the government will eventually

S

be paid 100 percent by the end of the 78 months.

7

Q

8

A

S

One-hundred percent without interest.
Without interest.

I think that was the point ha

was making when he said that we would get 100 percent.
Q

f©
It

His contention is that

And that the other creditors get 20 percent now

and that's all they ever get under the plan?
A

12

That was the contrast he was drawing, so that

13

even though, initially, under the plan we get only 10 percent

14

compared to their 20 percent, we would get the additional pay­

15

ments .
Q

16

that that's all the creditors will ever get?
