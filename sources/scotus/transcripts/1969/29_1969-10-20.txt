1

In this case an adjustment board determined that

2

there 'vas nothing in existing agreements which precluded Shore

3

line from establishing an outline reporting point; a point at

4

which the firemen made the required report &r work, retire at

5

the end of the day* away from the main terminal.

6

Shore line proposed to establish such a point.

The

7

'union served a notice proposing that the exclusive reporting

point should be at the Plum Terminal at Toledo.

to establish an outlying terminal* that was accomplished and

12

they were deprived of that right.
Now, the facts are briefly these;

13

Shore Lins is a

14

small railroad; it runs about 50 miles from Toledo ,to Detroit.

15

Lang Yard is the main line at the yard in Toledo and the yard

16

just south of Detroit is called Dearoad and there is one other

17

geographic point they have in mine, and'that’s at Trenton

18

where there is the Edison Yard.

19

of Toledo.

20

That’s about 35 miles north

There is a growing and large industrial development

21

there at Trenton.

While outlying have historically been estab­

22

lished 'for many years, Trenton was served by firemen who re­

23

ported at the Toledo Yard and went with their engines up to

24

Trenton, did the switching there then went "back the 35 miles and

25

tied up at Toledo.

In '61 this growing industrial development* in view

of the railroad, required

12

The alternate year for switching at Monsanto by

Shore line had passed, and they said "We don't propose to

14

In the meantime, in late °62 and September of ’63

22

The Adjustment Board decided againt.

The Adjustment

23

Board said there is nothing in the rule of agreement which pre­

24

cludes the establishment of that point and it is not contested

25

that under the existing agreements then Shore Line was

1

privileged to establish that outlying point.

They

A

And the response to that was a

That3s right, sir? and which would deny Shore

Line of the right that they then had to establish the outlying
points.
Thera was negotiation about this and that didn’t gat

12

in anywhere and Union invoked mediation and mediation was

13

pending at the time this, record was made-.

14

In late September of 3 66 Shore Line being confronted-

13

with the ima&iata requirement again of switching Monsanto aod

IS

McCouth Steel, having demanded service of them, they posted a

17

bulletin establishing an outlying assignment at Trenton for

18

trains ’to operate "in"the switching of these industrial estab­

19

lishments at Trenton.

20

At that point the Union threatened strike? Shoru

21

Line sought an injunction against the strike? the Union counter-

22

claimed for an injunction against the establishment of this

23

outlying point, but this Court denied the injunction against the

24

strike? granted the- injunction against the establishment of the

25

outling-point.

The Court below affirmed and the issue is thus

5

5

posed as to the correctness of the decision on certiorari of

2

this Court.

3

Now? the only previsions of the Railway Labor Act

4

which are actually involved here are Section 2 Seventh and

5

Section 6.

6

to me you have indicated that these two sections have to ho

7

read together and now I read them to youi

o

2-A? Page 2-A of our brief.

9

reads as follows?

10

The.go- called Status Quo Provision of Section 6 and

The first appears on

That Section 2 Seventh, which

"No carrier, its officers or agents shall change the

If

rates of pay, rule or working conditions of its employees, as a

12

class, as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed

IS

in such agreements of irv Section 6 of the Act."

u

there is no contest about the fact that that bars cnly a change

15

in the existing agreement,

18

the. rights under the existing agreements.

New, I think

it does not c©prive the parties of

11

Section 6 reads?

!S

"Carriers and representatives of the employees shall

19

give at least thirty days’ written notice or. an intended change

20

in agreements affecting rates of pay, rule or working condi­

21

tions, and the time and place for the beginning of conference

22

between the representatives of the parties interested in such

cn

intended changes shall be agreed upon within tea days after

24

the receipt of said notice, and said time shall be within the

25

thirty days provided in the notice. In every ease where such

6

7

Section 5 this Act, by the Mediation Board,1 et cetera.

by either party, or said

j

Now, what we say that this provision. Section 6

3

i

9

means, 'read together with Section 2 — what,this Court said it ';

10

meant -- in Williams versus th© Terminal Co,, here is what this

11

Court said;

12

"Institution of negotiations applied' in tie Section €•

13

Notice, the institution, of negotiations for collective bargain­

14

ing does not change the ‘authority of the’carrier.

15

‘Che pro­

hibitions of Section 6 against change of wages or conditions

IS

pending bargaining and those of Section 2 Seventh are aimed at

17

preventing changes in conditions previously fixed by collective

18

bargaining pleas.”
What we say Section 6 means is again what this Court

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

said it meant in the Order of Railroad Conductors against
Pitney.

There this Court said 2 Seventh of the Act provides

that no carrier, its offices or agents, shall change the
rates of pay rules or working conditions of its employees as
a class, as embodied

in

agreements except in the manner pres­

cribed in such agreements in Section 6 of the Act.

7

1

' Section 6, as we have seen, prohibits such change

2

unless notice is first given and its requirements are other-

3

wise complied with -Section 2 Tenth of the hat, makes a mis-

4

demeanor, punishable by both fining and imprisonment for a

5

carrier willfully to violate Section 6.

6

These sections make it clear that the only contract

7

which would violate Section C is a change of those working

8

conditions which axembodied: in agreement.

9

And what we think it means'’ is also what the indikkion

10

Board has consistently interpreted it means.

Section 6, the initial bill which ultimately changed

3

after emergency board is appointed*

5

But, if <X understand the main thrust o£ his argument;

6

it is that all of these provisions- — not all, 6, 5, and 10

7

must mean the same thing — not two because he concedes that 2

3

isn't to be read with them — til of them.

3

had to be read with 6 and Pitney.

10
11

12

This Court said it

He says ‘Met," that isn't a

status quo provision after the major dispute has arisen.

But

he says these three have to be read together and he gets soma
comfort from the language of 5 and 10.

Now, I don't know what

16
17
18
19
20

21
22

25

comfort he gets from 10, indeed, 5.

But 10 says that after a

emergency board has been appointed until 30 days after reports
to the president, no change shall be made in the conditions out
of which the dispute arose.

And 2 think the conditions of the

"dispute arises," is that under existing agreements we have the
right to establish an outlying point and they want to ter.o it
away from us, and they have proposed that change and that's
what shouldn't be changed.

That means that our rights.under the

existing agreement shouldn't be changed for this period.
Now, 5 provides that after the mediation board
releases the dispute for 30 days there should foe no change in
rate pay rules, working conditions or established practices.
There's little to indicate the reason for the introduction of

13

i

established practices.

I suggest it be defined somewhat, because it may

I think

there could well be a difference in a 'ituaticn where something
is specifically provided for in an agreement; and a situation
where something is simply management's right by default for the
reason that the agreement doesn't cover the subject matter.
Mr. Shea remarked that the Special Board, or its.award

as

So, this isn’t

conclusively established that management was privileged to do
this, only in the sense that the Special Board held that there
was no prohibition in the agreement against it.

The parties

hadn’t bargained; there was no clause in the agreement that said
from time to time management could change reporting points for
these men.

couldn't they go ahead and make the usual bumps and furloughs;

Now, the contention has been made hare that Section
2 seventh and Section 6 are the only sections of the statute
that are involved in this case.

There was further contended in

the reply brief that we had conceded that there were four —
pardon me -- four status quo sections in the Railway Labor Acts
Section 2 seventh. Section 6, Section 5 and Section 10.
Our position, of course, has been vary clearly stated
in our brief and we contend that Section 2seventh is not a
status quo provision at all, it is simply a prohibition against
changes of 'agreements unilaterally and it says that when there
is a written agreement, a carrier — and it speaks only in terms

We have referred to that legislative history in our
brief, commencing at Page 12 and that language is jane com­
pletely irreconcilable with any thought that the status quo
means just the terra ;so£ a contract that’s apparently existing.
At the bottom of Page,12, top of Page 13, 2 am reading from
Mr. Richberg’s comments before the House Committee on Inter­
state and Foreign Commerce.

He said;

'’The thought was to

include in the broadest way all the factors which contributed

to what is commonly called the status quo.

The purpose1 as* to

preserve unchanged all the conditions involved in the contro­
versy until there is full opportunity for a, presidential

He further said, and we have quoted - this at the
