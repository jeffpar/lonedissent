ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ'.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6

7

No.

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:

B

Presented for decision in this case is the constitutionality

9

of certain aspects of Arizona's Fruit and Vegetable Standardi­

10

zation Act.

11

a very important statute of an important agricultural state.

12

I believe that the issues which are present in this case can

13

best, be appreciated against the background of a brief

U

discussion of the nature and purpose of Arizona's Fruit and

15

Vegetable Standardisation Act, and the history of

IS

standardization acts in general.

Once again we have a very important industry and

17

Mr. Justice Brandeis reminds us in the Pacific

18

States Box and Basket Case, which is cited in our brief,

n

standardizetion acts, that is, acts which prescribe standards

20

for certaii. types of containers of agricultural produce, are

21

among the earliest examples of the exercise of police power by

22

the states.

23

authority for that proposition is Turner vs. Maryland,an 1883

24

unanimous decision by this Court.

25

Turner vs. Maryland which is not cited in. our brief, but

that

The case that Mr. Justice Brandeis cites as

2

There is some language in

1

which I believe definitely warrants the attention of the

2

Court, because it answers specifically one of the propositions

■£$

or one of the contentions raised by the Appellee in his brief.

4

The citation of Turner vs. Maryland is contained in our brief.

5

It is 107 U.S. 38.

$

In that case, this Court ruled as follows:

7

This particular quote appears at page S7,

"The state may direct that a certain product

8

while it remains in the bosom of the country and

9

before it has become an article of foreign commerce

m

or of commerce between the states shall be encased

n

in such a package as appears best fitted to secure

12

the safety of the package and to identify its

13

contents as the growth of the state."

«4

So that, as early as 1883 this Court in a unanimous

IS

decision declared that it lay within the police powers of the

IS

state to require that the produce of that state prior to the
I

I?

time that it leaves the state be encased in a certain type of

18

package, and that that package identify the produce as the

13

product of the state.
\

20

standard container known as a hogshead for Maryland tobacco,

21

and the statute required that the hogshead identify the

<>■3

tobacco contained therein as Maryland tobacco.

&iU«

23

Involved in that particular case was a

The Arizona Fruit and Vegetable Standardisation Act

24

rests upon considerations similar fco those which were approved

23

by this Court in Turner vs. Maryland.

3

The record in this case

j

i

contains a discussion of the conditions which led up to the

2

enactment cf the Standardization Act, and they are as follows. j

3

Prior to IS 2.9, when the Act was adopted, it was up to each

4

individual shipper within the state to set his own standards

5

both for the quality of the produce that he desired to ship,

6

and the type of container that he desired to ship it in, if he

7

shipped it in a container at all.

3

adopted by some shippers were very high,, and the standards

9

adopted by other shippers were not so' high.

Consequently the standards

It is abundantly

10

borne out by this record that it is of prime importance to

n

the success; of the marketing of fruits and vegetables that

12

the shipper maintain a good reputation for shipping quality

13

fruit, but the record also bears out that it is not always

14

possible to maintain that reputation separate and apart from

15

the reputation of the district or the state within which he

16

produces it and from which he ships his product, particularly

\7

where it is produced,.

13

Conversely stated, if a state can acquire a good
:

19

reputation for a certain type of produce, that reputation will

20

inure to the benefit not. only of the state as a whole, but,

21

also each individual grower and shipper within that state.

22

is not difficult to find example where states have been

23

successful in creating such reputations, such as Washington

24

apples, Florida oranges, Arizona grapefruit, and frankly we

23

believe Arizona cantaloupes,
4

It !

1

Ihis then, was the problem toward which the Fruit and

2

Vegetable Standardization Act was directed.

3

standards for a selected number of fruits and vegetables, now

4

37, within the State of Arizona, and those standards had to be

5

met by all shippers where the Act so provided»

6

that ‘they had to meet minimum standards not only of quality,

7

but also of pack, and that it had to be packed in standard

3

containers.

9

It set minimum

It also provided

The provisions dealing with cantaloupes as they appeal*

10

in the statute today are illustrative in this regard.

11

forth in the statute, and the statute's relevant provisions are

12

cited at the outset of our brief, the eanfceloupes must be

13

mature but not over-ripe.

U

decay, sponginess, wilting, insect damage, and a variety of

15

quality delects..

18

of the statute from the standpoint of this case are those

17

provisions which deal with the individual pack and the

18

appearance of the canteloupes within that pack.

19

As set

They have to be free "from mold,

But perhaps the most interesting provisions

20

purpose of the statute was to avoid deceptive packs or

{
I

You have cited some prior cases, but what would

7

you suppose: .the justification is for a state saying, "You may

3

not ship in bulk out of this state"?
h

3

The answer to that question, Mr. Justice, in

10

that, lies the entire justification of the Fruit arid Vegetable

n

Standardization Act.
Cl

12

U

I know, but what if the fellow you say that to

says, "Well, look, I am going to ship in bulk out of the
state.

There are a number of answers to that question.

They are the following.

This has to be the sole basis for preventing

No, sir, 1 submit it is not.

There are

additional reasons.

matter of stipulation in the record the highest quality of

15

any cantaloupes that are produced within the State of Arizona,

16

and therefore we feel that the state is entitled to have those

canteloupes, identified as Arizona canteloupes.

Q

10

These particular canteloupes are as a

j

So again you want them identified as Arizona

canteloupes and added up so Arizona will get credit for these.

21

Of course, if they are bad,, you don't want credit for them,

22

do you?
A

f

This is the

20

23

j

Pursuant to that, let me proceed with the

24

example that you gave of canteloupes which are shipped in bulk

25

across the state line.

They come from the field and are put

i

into a trailer.

Everything goes into the trailer, good fruit,

2

bad fruit.

It is mixed all up.
Q

3

By the way, do you have a regulation that says

4

how far you may transport cantaloupe from where they are

.3

picked up to the packing plant?

5

A

No, sir.

7

Q

Do you know how far

they are normally

3

transported when they are picked up in the field?

9

you could find that maybe they are carried twenty or thirty

10

miles within the State of Arizona to a packing plant.

n

A

n

Q

13

I suppose

That is possible.
At least as far as they are carried here across

the state line.

I would think that that would be possible.

point that I am about to make is that they can be carried a

good deal farther.

once those cantaloupes leave the State of Arizona, there is

5

no way that we have of assuring ourselves that they will not

go right on through to San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco

I have articulated some of the

reasons there is a problem with this.

Even assuming that that

10

is correct, if this Appellee is allowed to ship them across the!

state line in violation of the statute, we are going to have

12

to let others, and we have no control over how those will be

13

sold or whether they will be packed in standard, containers at

14

all.

13

before the produce leaves the state it is packed neatly in &

17

uniform in color, uniform in variety, so that when the grocer

opens that box, he knows that he can take the canteloupes opt

Yes, that is correct,.

There were individual

instances in which the administrators were not obeying the law.

of law that have been laid down by this Court which are

mentioned in the case that was argued before us, and that is

that the judicial function in applying the commerce clause to

commerce clause is a very limited one.

Mow, the real issue in the cause, the dispositive

16

issue in the case, is this, and arises in this fashion.

17

Appellee, as I read his brief, agrees there may under certain

18

circumstances be a legitimate interest in enforcing standardi­

19

sation, but he says there is a qualifying consideration in

20

this case because in the context of canteloupes, they can't be

21

packed except in a packing shed.

22

technology they can't.

this case comes within those decisions of this Court which

24

have said that where it is the sols objective of the statute

to require packing to be accomplished in this state, that

takes one more step, as indeed he must, and that is to say

4

that the purpose of the Arizona statute is the same, and that

is to preserve the packing business for this state,,

really the ultimate issue, the dispositive issue between these

Or is it a purpose which will make it invalid?

13

Is it the purpose that has been upheld by this Court

Once the case is viewed in that fashion, I submit

14

to this Court that the answer is very clear, because this

15

Court has made it clear in a number of cases, that it will

IS

not reexamine the wisdom of a state legislative determination,

17

and that sc long as there is a proper purpose that this

18

purpose will be assumed to be the purpose on which the state

19

legislature relied.

20

I need not recap those cases at this time.

They are

21

safe forth, in our brief, and I believe that they adequately

dispose of this contention.

ARGUMENT OF JACOB ABRAMSON, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF 05' APPELLEE

3

MR,, ABRAMSON:

4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

5

the Court, my learned colleague has stated that the

8

dispositive issue in this case is the purpose of the Arizona

7

law.

8

what the purpose is, and this is to achieve credit to the

9

State of Arizona for good fruit.

What is the purpose?

It has already been made clear

The concern is not about

10

receiving discredit for poor fruit, because in this case the

11

poor fruit is going to be packed in other states.

12

receive credit for good fruit.

It is to

Mr. Justice, the argument of Appellant is

'19

that Parker fruit is good fruit.

20

as good fruit.

2!

states this repeatedly, that it is to enhance the reputation

22

by identifying the fruit as Arizona fruit.

23

getting to is that the determining question here is not what

24

is the purpose of the Arizona law, even if the purpose is to

23

obtain credit, although -this Court has never gone so fax as to

This is the main concern.

In his argument he

The point I am

permit what the Appellant seems to do here in furtherance of

2

that purpose. Even to achieve credit we say is not an improper

purpose.

4

and to get credit for it.

S

issue before this Court is how far may the State of Arizona

6

go'in trying to achieve this purpose.

It is fine, we say, if one wants to do a good job
But that is not 'the issue.

The

In order to achieve this purpose, the State of

7
8

Arizona through the interpretation of fixe Arizona law by the

9

Appellant is saying three things must occur.

One, the packing

iO

must be done in Arizona; two, the packing must be done in a

n

packing shed in Arizona; and in the context of this case,

\z

where the Church Company does not have packing facilities at

13

Parker, and indeed cannot have such facilities because there

14

are no railroad lines going in there, must construct packing

15

facilities at Parker.

16

does not in terras say you must do this, and therefore we can't

17

hear you to complain, but this is the necessary effect of his

18

order.

19

this, that this is the dilemma in which the Appellee finds

20

itself, fchcfc in order to comply with the order,it must do these

21

three things.

22

To be sure. Appellant states the law

In fact, the Appellant in its brief expressly states

It had nothing to do with the question

It was purely a criminal statute, and imposed

a penalty for the handling of such fruits.

The Sligh case

would have been a case similar to ours if the state in that
case had said this citrus fruit must be packed in this state,
but that was not the situation in the Sligh case.
Mention has been, made of the Pacific Box case.

This

involved a law of the State of Oregon which established certain
standard containers to be used for packing in that state of
raspberries and strawberries.

An out of state manufacturer of

containers challenged this law, saying, "l want to come into
Oregon and sell my containers in Oregon."

These were different

containers from those provided under the Oregon law.

7

MR. LEE:

The significant contention raised by Mr. Abramson,

10

and this of course has been at the heart of his- position

11

throughout this entire litigation, is that the purpose of this

IZ

statute is to require the packing be done in the State of

13

Arizona.

14

the well established rules of statutory construction in

15

constitutional cases as set forth on page 34 to 39 of our brief

16

Courts simply don't ascribe improper purposes to the statute.

17

The statute nowhere says any tiling about a packing shed.

18

would point out to the Court that this statute deals with 37

19

different prodvicts, only one of which is cantaloupes.

It is not.

There is no requirement.

he can then carry out the inspection responsibilities

23

I need not re-read the language that the Chief Justice has read,

That language is

it points cut that it is a proper purpose to be concerned

significant for two reasons.

29

First of all,

i

with the state * s reputation in interstate commerce , and

p
i*t*

secondly, it points out that as long as that could have been

3

the legislative purpose, then the statute will be upheld.

4

Mr. Abramson, I understand his comments agreed that

5

Turner vs. Maryland was against him, but argues that it is too ;
j

6

old and therefore the Court ought not to follow it.

7

Justice Stewart, so that you don't think I am totally

8

incompetent in having missed it the first time around, let me

point out that the language that 1 found which thoroughly

Mr.

10

resolves this comes at the end of a very long, long opinion.

In order to save you the same problem, might I point out that

32

is at page 57 of the United States Reports.

33

Finally, and in conclusion, and I won’t need to use

34

my seven minutes, this is an economic regulation.

15

regulation imposed by a state pursuant to its police powers

16

and this Court has made it very clear, starting with Uebia vs.

17

New York that there is a heavy burden which rests upon those

18

individuals who seek to upset that police power regulation on

39

the ground that it is unconstitutional.
