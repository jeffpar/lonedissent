ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. BASS

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. BASS:

Mr. Chief Justice? may if please the Court:

8

This is an appeal from the Illinois Supreme Court,
presenting the question whether Illinois statutes, which

9
10

authorize a pauper's incarceration in excess of the maximum

11

period prescribed by law at the rate of $5 a day for payment

12

of fine and court costs, despite the fact that the defendant

13

is willing and able to

14

violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

pay them if given the opportunity,

The facts, which are undisputed, are briefly as

15

16

follows:

A complaint was issued in June of 1967 against Willie

1?

Williams to the crime of theft of property, not from the person

*8

and not exceeding a. $150 in value.

19

$2,000 bail was set.

case was brought before the court the following day, August 14,

21

at which time bail was set at $2,000.

The warrant was issued and

Williams was arrested on August 13.

The

Williams was remanded to jail? on motion of the state

22

the case was continued to .August 16.

On August 16, -dhe case

jOn September 6 the trial commenced.

The defendant appeared

property.

with which to post the 10 per cent under Illinois law.

was unable to hire an attorney; and that then he was unable to

And it further alleged that if the defendant were

The state did not contravene the factual allegations

but moved to dismiss.

The lower court dismissed the petition

without evidentiary hearing, and then the appeal was taken to

10

Secondly, the possibility was substantial that if

there had been a retrial, there would, have been a reconviction

19

May of 1968? about 9 months.

20

What we do challenge in this case is the construction

21

of the statute by the Illinois Supreme Court which authorises

22

24 hour a day imprisonment, over the maximum at the rate of $5
1
a day, despite the fact that the defendant has said, without

23
24
25

any opposition by the state, that he will go out and get a job
and earn the funds to pay his fine if he is given the
6

1

opportunity.
The state has indicated that it has 2 primary goals

2
<C»

to be served'.

The practice of incarceration of indigents

4

should be sustained because of those goals.

5

deterrence of crime and collection of revenue from the fines.

Those are;

However, examination reveals that around the clock

S

7

imprisonment of an indigent under these circumstances is neither

8

necessary nor rationally related to these stated goals.

there are clearly less onerous alternatives and, perhaps, more

And

effective ones to satisfy the state's interests.
Certainly if the state's interest is in the collecting

11
12

of revenue, on remitting the person to jail, they are not

13

going to get the money and, in addition, the state has to pay

14

substantial amounts of money to house prisoners in an already

It is our position that the state could certainly

as long as they let him go at night.

In our hierarchy

of alternatives that we ha\?e suggested, we have placed
remitting to the work house as one of the possibilities.

But

the problem in this case is that they keep the man in jail
around the clock.

And there is absolutely no justification

for incarcerating somebody at night merely because they are

extracting his day labors.
Q

2
■o

Do you think the Supreme

Court of Illinois had

judicial power to shape that kind of solution to the problem?
A

4

We feel the Illinois Supreme igourt could easily

have saved the statute by construction.

For example, the

first sentence in the statute talks in terms of a judgment of

a fine imposed upon a defendant may be enforced in the same

8

manner as a judgment in a civil action.
-Just last November the Illinois Supreme. Court held in

a civil case that, you could not obtain a body execution —•

11

that is jail — as a civil debt, absence showing a refusal

No.

The Illinois Supreme Court does not treat

imprisonment as s. result of a. conviction as a debt which is
considered In that prohibition.

But if the Illinois Supreme

Court had construed the section to require resort to the other
alternatives before remitting the person immediately, the
Illinois Supreme Court could, have avoided the constitutional
infirmity in this case.

We do raise it, but what we have in this case is

and performance of work during the daytime hours as a form of

incarceration?

Q

You were suggesting, I take it, just a moment

5

ago there were circumstances under which the state could keep

6

the man in jail around the clock, weren't you?

7

A

I wasn't suggesting that, but I can envision the

8

possibility where, after an adequate inquiry is made, it is

9

determined that there is very real probability that if they

conduct that would lead to remitting to incarceration.

Welly if he absolutely refuses to work, that

is contumacious conduct? that is a complete refusal to be

Q

Then what can the state do?

6

A

Under those circumstances the state might do

7

what it does with respect to a person who has the funds and

that is say, "You sit unless you work or pay."

Q

Is there a separate proceeding for that to

determine the factual

That is the

problem.

Mo provision is made for any kind of inquiry or

13

hearing or factual evidence to determine whether or not the

14

defendant is refusing to pay or refusing to work or refusing

15

to comply with his obligations -■—
Q

16

Well, would you say that the state, in order

17

to satisfy its obligation with all these, before it could

incarcerate a man 24 hours a day, it would have to offer him

We think that it is unrealistic to think that

15

there is no work at all in this case, but if evidence did

show that it was impossible to place him anywhere, we think that

it would be permissible to require him to work at a

A

It is our position that the interests of

society do not justify such an onerous exaction, such an
imposition upon the liberty of the defendant.

It is interesting

to note that the state which talks in terms of, "Are these

a sufficient ground for such an onerous exaction.

That is correct.

I

3

thought your argument was that putting him in jail beyond the

tional?
A

6

Right.

Let me explain that.

With respect to

7

a person who is doing a straight jail sentence, he is certain­

8

ly receiving quite a benefit to be told that he can obtain

9

some liberty during the day, and he can hardly complain of

10

that.

But the person who is being incarcerated for non-payment

When they let him go out during the day to get that money,

13

they then have completely undermined that by saying that he

something other than what it seems rather clearly to say

20

As I read Illinois Revised Statute 1967, Chapter 38,

However, if I understand that it has been

Well, we certainly thought the language of the

21

statute could be interpreted literally and would be granted

22

a discharge.

23
24
25

Q

How have the Illinois courts construed it?

A

They have construed the language until all

legal means have been exhausted to mean that the defendant

15

i

even must show he is physically unable to work — which is

2

the gallstones case, People vs. Hedenberg — or that no work

3

is provided for him.

4

In fact,, the record shows —- the jail record of Williams is

5

included in here, on page 33 of the record — and it doss show

6

that when he was serving his jail time, he worked in the

7

laundry, and he worked in the tailor shop and he worked in

8

some-thing beginning with wk" which I think is the kitchen.

9

that all people that are in jail have the opportunity to work,

There is always housekeeping available.

So

10

A person who is working off his fine is not going to be doing

11

anything diff©rently.

tz

The state has attempted to suggest that the policy of

13

deterrence requires the result reached in this case.

14

dispute that contention for the following reasons;

15

the fact that Illinois is willing, under 180-6, to discharge

16

persons who are unable to work or for whom no work is

17

provided, is an indication that automatic incarceration of

18

everybody who won31 pay fines is not necessary to the enforce­

ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. THOMPSON

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
In 1927 Justice Holmes referred to the equal protec­

It

tion clause as the last resort of constitutional arguments.

12

reading of the opinions of this Court will show that we have

13

come quite a ways since that characterization.

14

Skelly Wright of the United States Court of Appeals for the

15

District of Colombia referred to the equal protection clause

16

as the cutting edge of our expanding constitutional liberties.

17

A

In fact, Judge

One. of the issues that is involved in this case

18

before the Court today is whether that cutting edge will press

19

so deeply, not only into the statutory scheme in the State of

20

Illinois, but the statutory scheme of the other American states

21

in the Federal Government, to compel those states and Federal

22

Government to adopt a system of criminal justice administration,

23

greatly different from that which they have adopted by the

24

legislative process, in the name of the explication of the

25

equal protection clause.
20

we should consider at the outset what some

of the interests are in considering the.context or setting of

3

the equal protection argument in this case.

considered in context.

protection claim here is an important one.

As Mr. Justice

First, the history of incarceration to work off a
fine which cannot or will not be paid is an ancient one, far

outdating the American legal system.

in his opinion for the Court in Kotch vs. the Board of River

12

Pilots some years ago and in his dissenting opinion in Harper

13

vs. the Virginia Board of Elections, the history of a practice

14

is important in considering whether or not that, practice

15

violates the Federal Constitution.

16

Mr. Justice Black said,

Similarly the widespread usage of a particular

17

feature of a criminal justice system by the states and. by the

Federal Government is also important in assessing its validity

19

under the Federal Constitution.

As was noted for the Court in

here that all of the states of the federal union for years and

years and years, and the English Government before that, have

12

It is really not a reimbursement scheme as such.
But to answer your question, I think that if a man

was sentenced simply for a year in jail, the state is entitled

16

to exact that year in terms of his time in the normal theory

of jail punishment; and they are also entitled to the benefits

of his labor, I think, during that period.

19

But the sentence in this case was a year in jail

That is true.

The question that that raises is

does that violate the equal protection clause.

And that was

the question that was raised in the brief, axrd that is a
question which this Court has

never really considered.

I would like to turn to my remaining moments of
30

t

arguments to an examination of how this Court's previous

2

cases, setting forth what the requirements for the equal

3

protection clause are, could touch this case.
Obviously, the traditional test that this Court has

4
5

talked about in equal protection cases is;

what class

6

has the state set up?

7

whatever reason, pay their fine.

What scheme has the state

8

adopted to deal with that class?

In this case, the work-off

system.

In this case, deterrence of crime by preserving the value

fi

of fines in the courts which impose fines as -a component of

12

our criminal justice system

13

which fines bring it.

and the collection of revenue

The final question under the traditional test: does

14:
15

the state's scheme rationally relate to the end result which they

16

seek to achieve?

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

In this case we say it does, because the

work-off system of Illinois offers the opportunity for 'the
state to keep -the fine system viable and, at the same time,
to collect the equivalent of the fine in the labor of the
defendant.
Q

What does Illinois collect out of fines each year,

do you know?
A

1

am not certain. Your Honor, but it is certainly

in the high millions of dollars when you count in the fines
collected by the courts which handle cases in which the fine
31

I

is the only punishment, including traffic offenses — I am

of its citizens and to provide, some means for alternative
collection if the man failed to pay it.

Why would it?

Well, in the traffic area,, for example, a

state would be loath to provide that the only possible penalty

that could be imposed in a traffic case was a jail sentence.

think we would have chaos in traffic law enforcement.

8

Q

That is getting to what I was talking about.

9

A

Right.

The second thing that it would do is

io

that it would encourage spurious claims of indigency and that

11

it would impose on the courts least able to handle it

12

burden of determining something new in a case.

13

they first determine guilt, but, after a determination of guilt,

14

if there was a claim of indigency and that a fine could not

be paid, they would have to hold a hearing to determine whether

24

Q

What this amounts to — which has to be faced --

25

is that it imposes a punishment upon a man who has no money

that cannot possibly be imposed on a man who has money.

2

A

Well, if I accepted'---

3

Q

Isn't that right?

A

If I accepted you premise, I would agree with you

5

I cannot, under the terms of my argument, accept the premise

6

that it imposes unfair punishment.

7
S
9

Q

I am not talking about premises, I am talking

about terms of fact.
A

In fact, he goes to the same jail as a man who

10

is sentenced to a straight jail term, that is correct.

II

in fact, if a man pays his fine, he doesn't go to fail.

12

Q

And,

In fact, it amounts to sending a man to jail

13

who is fined and who is indigent where you do not send a man

U

to jail who has money and is not indigent.

15

A

And who pays the fine, that is correct.

16

Q

That is what it results in.

17

A

That is just what happens.

18

Q

Then the question is does that violate the

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Const!tution?
A

It does not violate the Constitution, because,

under the traditional equal protection test which this Court
has set up, if we show a rational class of those who do not
pay, a rational statement of objectives to be achieved

and a

rational connection between the two, the work-off system, it
doesn't violate equal protection even though it may treat some
38

1

people differently than others.

2

But even if we move beyond that traditional test —

3

as this Court has moved in some areas, for example, in the

4

Shapiro Case, testing whether or not a one year residency

5

requirement for welfare violated the equal protection clause,

6

where Mr. Justice Brennan said that in cases involving exercise

7

of constitutional rights

8

interest

9

cases which have essentially used a balancing approach;

you have to show a compelling state

not merely a rational relationship; or some other

10

advantages gained by the state outweigh the disadvantages to

11

the defendant —• we believe that the interest

12

Illinois and the rest of the states of the Union, in preserv-

13

ing the idea that this does not violate equal protection —

14

this and allied practices such as the area of bail — is so

15

strong that it outweighs the disadvantage to the indigent

16

defendant, even if the test is compelling state interest or

17

the balancing of advantages to one side.

18

Q

of the State of

I am going to state your balanedng in a little

19

different way.

are saying is that the state has such a compelling interest

24
25

Let's forget about the theories.

What you

in making indigents serve time that no one else has to serve
in the state, that it would simply block the state's efforts'?
A

I think that if this Court were to hold that

indigency excused a man from incarceration under the work-off
system, that the threat to other state interests — including
39

i

the maintenance of the whole fine system- the maintenance of

2

the courts which enforce the fine system (especially in those

3

cases where the fine is the only penalty) and the maintenance

4

of the monetary bail system — and the potential saddling of all

5

those courts with spurious claims of indigency (which do not

6

now arise because a man knows if he doesn’t pay his fine, he

7

is going to jail to work it off) are so compelling that they

8

outweigh’ whatever disadvantages there; are in sending an

9

indigent man to jail to work off his fine.

10
11

Q

You would probably have a hard time convincing

an indigent of that reasonableness, wouldn't you?

12

A

We probably would.

13

Q

In the federal system do you know what -the

14

statute is?

15

A

Yes, Your Honor.

The man goes to jail for no

16

more than 30 days in paying off the fine.

There are two considerations, I think, Mr,

11

Justice White,

If we are going to consider the question of

12

alternatives in the work-off system which are thought to be less

13

onerous to the indigent defendant than the work-off system?

14

the first question which arises is;

15

of this Court to examine whether there are viable alternatives,

16

or must tl^is Court, in an equal protection case, refrain from

17

deciding what is a wiser, what is a more humane, what is a

18

more just system of the enforcement of the criminal law.

Q

Wall, I know, but you are talking about stats

21

A

Yes, sir.

Compelling state interests.

23

That is correct.

Q

And if there is a viable alternative, why then

it puts your argument about compelling state interests in a
41

rather different light.

VJ'

A

•{m

Well, I am not sure.

If we were following the

3

traditional test of equal protection cases, we would not stop

4

to inquire whether there were, in fact, alternatives.

5

if we are following what has been called the balancing test or

6

the compelling state interest test, I am not sure, even 'there,

7

that the same rule doesn’t carry over.
In other words, if this Court can find a compelling

the state has selected — we think the work-off system standing

by itself is a rational scheme

12

even in a compelling interest case, if this is one, that this

Court can say, "But we will strike down the rational scheme

then I am not so sure that,

As this Court said just a few weeks ago in the

In Illinois, as this Court sits today, we have a

various alternatives that a holding adverse to the State of

I think the danger of that as a consequence of

That is not an equivalent.

It was estimated that in the City of Chicago between 1907 and

Q

I would like to ask again about the instances

18

in which on a traffic fine when the offender can't pay,arid he

19

has been sent to prison to work it out?

20

A

We don't have those figures.

21

Q

Do you knew anything of that practice?

22

A

I believe that the traffic courts have been

23
24

25

granting installments on some occasions, but 'I don't have the
exact figures.
But in terms of the cost problem, the economics of

2

by —Q

3

Well, I suppose that we would agree with you.

4

It would be hard to obtain a conclusion in your favor so as it

5

would not reach the traffic fine situation, wouldn't it?
A

6

Well, to the extent that the offense is

7

punishable by fine only, we would be dealing with a situation

8

of poor people being subjected to a sanction different from

9

the sanction as to rich people.
Q

10

So that you say that, if we agree with you in

11

this case, we ought to reach the same result, in the traffic

12

fine case.

13

A

You don’t have to reach that in this case, but —

14

Q

But we take that step, don't we?

15

A

We would submit that if the judge determines

16

that ~~ Well, first of all, if the offense is serious enough

17

to warrant incarceration of an individual -- which seems to

18

underlie a lot of this, letting indigents get away with

19

violating the law with impunity,

20

ability to set up imprisonment as an alternative.— but if

21

the offense is not serious enough to require an exaction

because: legislature has the

22

greater than the fine, there is no justification for putting

23

people in jail simply because they don't have the wherewithal

24
25

to pay that.
Q

You have almost gone around the circle now on
47

1

my counter-productive proposition.

2

might respond by making a greater number of classes of crime

3

subject to imprisonment which are now subject only to fines as

4

a response to a holding that you can't have an alternative for

5

a poor man,

6

A

You say the legislature

Well, it is possible that the legislature has

7

always had the discretion to determine what penalties are

8

appropriate for what offenses.

9

this situation is an automatic system that puts people in jail

What we are talking about in

10

without any inquiry whatsoever about whether the money —

11

which the state says is the appropriate sanction — the fine,

12

can be satisfied in means less onerous,
Q

13

If the legislature has all these powers, this

is exactly what the legislature has done in this case.

14

A

15

The legislature has not,— according to the

16

construction put on the statute by the Illinois Supreme Court -

17

the legislature has not allowed -these alternatives,

18

Q

As I understood, that is what this case is

IS

about; that

the Illinois Legislature has said that if a

20

person who is

convicted cannot pay his fine, he can be put

21

in jail instead.

22

A

Well, that is what they said.

23

Q

That is what the case is about.

So the

legislature has done this.

24

A

25

But our point is that the legislature may not

48
!

1

constitutionally do that.

2

Q

But it may, according to your submission as I

3

understand it, say that the punishment for any offense can be

4

fine up to $5 or imprisonment up to 5 days?

5

The legislature may prescribe maximum penalties,

yes .
