MR. WILSON:

The informer who negotiated the

The facts are that on December 9, .1965, informant -

23

time there was a narcotic agent hiding in a closet where he

24

could see and hear the events in the kitchen and the informant

25

had on him a cel radio which is a short-range radio.
2

At that

The

'i

narcotics agent in the car a short, distance away from the house

listened to the conversation.

3

of one ounce of heroin.

4

At that time there was delivery

December 10th there was another such meeting at

5

which the same set-up with the — at which time the informant

6

paid $1,000 and agreed to purchase some additional heroin the

7

next day.

8

On December the 14th the informant went to Defendant

9

White's home, also with a radio on him and went in and paid the

10

Defendant in his home and agreed, to purchase two additional

11

ounces.

12

to the conversation.

13

At that time a Government Agent was outside listening

On December 16th» '65 the informant's car — the

14

informant and Defendant drove for two hours with the informant

15

having on him a cel radio and with agents of the Narcotic

16

Bureau following the car and listening to the conversation.

17

In that series of events the Defendant took the informant's car

18

and let the informant out and went and met: another man named

19

Sam Minerva, who gave him heroin and then he picked up the

20

informant again,,

21

On December the 13th back in informant Jackson’s

22

kitchen in his home, with Jackson and White at the table, an

23

agent in the closet? an agent outside listening to the radio,

24

there was paid $1,250 on the transaction by Jackson to White.

25

On December 29th, *65 White met the informant Jackson
3

1

-- agreed to meet him at Lake and Wells Street in Chicago; each

2

drove his own cart

White walked up to Jackson3s car and de­

livered the heroin with Jackson having on his radio and the
4

agents listening from some distance»
On January 5th in informant Jackson's kitchen with the

11

same set-up, Jackson paid White $1,300»

restaurant called the Alumina Restaurant, which the Defendant,
had some connection with, they met, discussed — again with the
radioon and narcotic agents outside of the restaurant listening
to the conversation.

14
15

On January the 9th, White, the Defendant, drove up
and stopped at State and Randolph Street where he was met by
Minerva delivering the narcotics.

18
19

20

At that time the agents

closed in and made the arrest and the case was completed.
So, to recap;

16

17

They agreed to meet at Lake and Wells

Street to purchase three things of heroin for $2,500.

12
13

On January 8th, at a

there were four meetings in the

informant's kitchen; one meeting in the Defendant's home; two
meetings in informant's car; one meeting at the Alumina Restaur­
ant and in addition to that, an overhearing on the telephone, ■
the very opposite of the Kata case, where the informant called
the Defendant and permitted the agents to listen in on his end

21

of the telephone through the same receiver;*
22

Let's look first at what questions are not involved
23

in this.

We do not have any questions of the Fifth or Sixth

24

amendments because this is not the overhearing of conversations
25
4

I

past events; the nature of admission of a confession»

2

rhis is an overhearing of the actual transaction itself and

3

there is no recitation relied on and put in evidence or involved

4

here that would involve either the Fifth Amendment or Sixth

5

amendment questions in the sense of either testifying against

6

himself as to past events# or the right to counsel.

7

And that, we think,, is fairly clear if you consider

8

the situation involving the normal condition of the bank lobby

9

now, where there is a hidden camera and frequently-hidden radio

10

or recording devices.

The bank robber comes in and triggers the

11

camera and the camera records the actual crime itself and the

12

recording device or radio records the words used by the bank

13

15

IS

21

25

robber in committing the crime,.

I think no one would seriously

contend that there was any constitutional question in the Fourth,
Fifth or Sixth involved in that situation.
Here the radio was substantially the same thing; a
broadcast of the crime itself being committed.

The — White’s

conversation and the words used against him in evidence were all
a part of a contract and sale; a commercial transaction; the
contract and sale of heroin.

This is not a crime of violence

or any other kind of crime# except a commercial transaction*
that is by law made illegal.
And so the — as far as the informant’s kitchen and
car is concerned, there” is no trespass because they belonged to
the informant, who invited the Defendant White to come there and

i

1

make the sale.

2

Defendant's home there was no trespass because the Defendant

3

invited the informant to come to his home to make payment for

4

the narcotise.

'IS

All of that is pretty well governed by the

Lewis case.
Now, that brings us to Kata * which, as you all know,

6
7

And the restaurant was a public* place and

is the bugging of the telephone booth situation.

And it's

discussions of the expectation of privacy which is involved in
the central question concerned with in this situation.

And so

we ask ourselves, what legal expectations of privacy did the
law afford to Defendant White when ha went to informant Jackson;s
kitchen to sell narcotics.

Certainly the law does not protect

White against the other party to the transaction testifying.
This is, as I said, a bargain and sale —■ a contract, made
partly in words; partly by the passage of money and partly by
the passage of the narcotics, the delivery of the narcotics.
And whether it's civil or criminal, neither side can

17

testify as to a contract, and in any type of case when the
18
19

20

parties enter into a commercial transaction that is. by law made
criminal, either party can testify.
of privacy.

So, White had no expectation

The other side of his contract wouldn't and

21

couldn't testify to it, as ha had a perfect legal right to do.
22

t.

And then there is in this situation language which
23

comes in that 1 think needs to be clarified somewaht, and- that
24

is this coming from some of the older cases, the question of
25

.

©

I

\

misplaced confidences between the seller of narcotics who is

2

selling to a government agent.

3

I want to point but that this was an arms-length

4

transaction; this isn’t — there wasn't any relationship of

5

confidence between these people.

6

lawyer-client; doctor-patient; priest-penitant, or anything like

7

that.

8

And one of the risks that a man in the illegal business of

9

selling narcotics takes is that some of his customers will tern

10

out to be government agents and he knows that when he goes into

11

the business.

It is not husband-wife;

This is a sale between strangers? an arms-length sale.

He runs that risk.

And so there isn't any misplaced confidence in this

12

13

situation.

And certainly the law was not to protect White

14

against either the fact that it may turn out to be a government

15

agent and that he may testify.

16

on the part of the informant in this situation —

And there is no breach of duty

17

Q

The informant didn't testify; did he?

18

A

No, sir; he didn't.

Q

Do you see any distinction between that in

21

A

Yes,, sir; 1 do„ Mr. Justice, in this?

That

22

it gets to the policy of the question raised by the former

23

Chief Justice in his dissent in one of these cases and that is:

24

can the Government use the recorded or secondary testimony, if

25

you want to call it that, when the informant doesn't testify.

7

1

In this case we could not find the informer at the time and it

2

becomes then, I guess, a policy question as to whether Government

3

should or should not be able to use this testimony at this time.,

4

But it is not a constitutional question because the constitution-'

3

al right is determined as of the time of the search and not by

6

development of the case.

I understand that you didn’t put in all of the

conversations.

Mr. Justice, we will have to make a statement.

These narcotic agents? by the nature of things? they are usually

world in many ways and this gives the Bureau of Narcotics a

Now? taking the subject of these consensual overhear­

ings direct? we take the flat position that a consensual over­

13

not involve Fourth Amendment problems.

It‘s almost the exact

Of course the Court is familiar with the Lopes case

I may say that

10

the Government uses these cel radios in two main situations in

13

Government, as everybody knows.

21

22

And that brings us to On Lee, perhaps the earliest of
these case,

And On Lee, of course, has been greatly criticized

23

and is vulnerable to criticism on the Fifth and Sixth Amendments

24

and that is the obtaining by stealth of a confession or admission

25

after the event which, in On Lee, as the Court remembers, the

12

1

narcotic

2

side after the case had been made and after indictment and it

3

raises both Fifth and. Sixth Amendment problems.

of the evidence; it might go to some such problem as best

evidence, but it doesn’t go tothe constitutionality of the

Gould I ask you a question: what impact do you

think this Court's decision in desist has on your position?
A

Well, we have desist as a second point.

urge are very hopeful of not reaching that, but we can prevail

23

on our first Fourth Amendment.

24

case if you pass that —-

25

Q

But we think this is a desist

That is a hurdle you've got to overcome here.

13

i

I

Desist as it stands is not retroactive.,

2

4

A

Yes, sir.

Q

So that where do you go from there?

A

Well*, we feel that this is Kats.

I don't know

5

that I fully understand my way all around the desist laws, but

6

if I understand it correctly, that is when the Court enunciates

7

what amounts to new constitutional elements in the sense of

8

overruling and accepting the position that as far as the officers

9

are concerned, it applies only to thsir acts after they have full

10

knowledge of the new law and that being true, we think that it

11

should apply here and especially in the fact that this is such a

12

widespread device and is used throughout law enforcement and

13

it's been done in the belief that it is not a search warrant

14

situation.

15

Q

Do you think it's of considerably more signifi­

16

cance that your department is a law enforcement department to

17

know now what would happen in this case violating the constitu­

18

tion, rather than simply to get this judgment affirmed on the

19
20

basis of the nonretroactivitv of the Kats case.

A

That8s correct, Your Honor.

We sincerely hope

*

21

that the Court can see its way to write on this point, rather

22

than the desist point if possible, because it's one that's vital

23

to the daily work of the law enforcement agencies; and the desist!

24

point is a matter of salvaging the case.

25

Q

That3 s right.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN L. BOEGER, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

this case.

The record below and the Government’s

This issue was raised by Respondent in the Court of

Appeals»

The Court of Appeals specifically stated in their

IS

In our position I call your attention to the fact that the record

did not support consent -- voluntary consent.

Now, the Government tries to excuse this failure to

sustain its burden of proving consent by saying

Your point, Mr» Boeger, is that if, in this

hypothetical case the man is an agent only by reason that he is

the unknown carrier of a microphone surreptitiously put there

by another government agent that that’s the equivalent of just

27

projecting a microphone or bug inside that room without the

knowledge of anybody.

suggest that this case is that kind of a case when the record

shows here that this man voluntarily, knowingly, had a micro­
