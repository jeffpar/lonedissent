The relevant facts inthis case were stipulated and

In August, 1953 Hilton Hotels Corporation owned seme
325,370 shares of the 366,040 shares outstanding of the Hotel
Waldorf Astoria, leaving some 40,670 shares of Waldorf out­
standing in the hands of others,
Contemplating a merger, Hilton retained, consultants
to do a study to determine a fair basis for exchange of Hilton
shares for Waldorf shares,

Hilton and Waldorf agreed upon a

proposed merger, with Hilton to be the surviving

corporation.

Under the proposed plan, Hilton offered to exchange
1,25 shares ©f its stock for each share of the Waldorf stock
it did not already own.

Prior to the agreement of merger,

however, shareholders owning some .20,000 shares of Waldorf,
filed with Waldorf an objection to the merger and demanded
payment for their Waldorf stock.
Thereafter, on December 28 and. 29, 1953, more than
two-fchirds of the stockholders of each of the two corporations

2

1

voted approval of the merger.

And. on December '31, 1953, the

2

merger agreement and certificate of consolidation were filed

3

with the Secretary of State of Hew York.

4

The applicable Hew York Law provided that in such a

5

case the stockholder demanding payment for his Waldorf shares

6

had no right to .receive dividends payable on those shares after

7

the close of business on the day preceding the date that the

8

Waldorf stockholders voted approval of the merger.

9

upon that vote, the dissenting stockholder ceased to have ary

10

other rights of a stockholder of Waldorf, except the right to

11

receive payment of the value of his stock.

And, that

Under the Hew York Law the dissenting stockholder or
the corporation had the right to have the stock appraised in a
court proceeding,.

Complying with Hew York Law, on January 7,

1954, Hilton offered to theWaldorf stockholders, $24,50 for
each share of Waldorf stock it did not already own.

Those

stockholders who had dissented from the merger rejected the
offer and began court proceedings under state law for a deter­
mination of the value of their shares.
Hi.].ton again retained the same consulting firm to
determine the value of those Waldorf shares on the day prior to
the vote of approval of the merger.
In addition to paying those consultants, Hilton aslo
paid almost $40,000 to lawyers in others in connection with the
court proceedings to develop that value,
3

Hilton claimed a deduction as an ordinary and
necessary business expense under Section 162 of the Code- for
all of the fees paid to the consulting firm, attorneys and
othersf including the fees that had bean paid to the consultants
prior to the vote of the merger.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the
deduction? Hilton paid the asserted deficiency and commenced a
suit for refund.

The District Court held that the appraisal

costs were deductible» but that the consultants' fees that
were incurred prior to the merger were nondeductible capital
expenditures»
Hilton conceded as to those pre-merger fees and the
7th Circuit affirmed the District Court, allowing deduction oi
appraisal fees.

Q

This was a taxable year 1555?

A

This began in 1953, sir.

Q

Well, the transaction began in 'S3? I would

guess probably the taxable year involved was 1954?

Sir, that is part of it.

1 would assume that

5

in a situation such as this, where you have large corporations

6

involved, the administrative audits probably do not come until

7

late in the statutory period and then all of the proceedings

8

that follow that, keep eating up a little time.

Of course, it's only money.

A

The sole issue here, then, is whether the fees

paid to the consultant lawyers and others, in connection with
the appraisal proceeding that followed the merger are deductible
ordinary and necessary business expenses or nondeductible
capital expenditures„
While we're concerned in this case with Section 162,

15
16

Q

that deals with business expenses and also with Section 263
again, as in the last case, we nevertheless, are concerned with
the same basic principles that were involved in the Woodward
case.
Section 162 provides a deduction for the ordinary and
necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in
the carrying of the trade or business.

It does not provide a

deduction for a capital expenditure.
Section 263, on the other hand, prohibits deductions
on a capital expenditure.
5

The origin and character ofthe claim with respect to

which an expenditure is incurred determines or contributes to

3

the determination of whether an expenditure is or is not

4

deductible» The costs of acquiring an asset of capital stock

are not deductible? they are nondeductible capital expenditures
Q

What about the legal expenditures in connection

with the merger itself?

They are capital items,

They are not deductible?

The lawyer fees for drawing up themerger plan

That’s right, sir»

Capital expenditures.

15

A

That’s right.

16

Just 33 the Seventh Circuit noted below, the ex *

17

pendifcures incurred in connection with the corporate re­

18

organization, such as the ones that Mr. Justice White just

19

asked about, are nondeductible capital expenditures.
In considering this case alongside the Woodward case,

20
21

there is only one additional item that we think we should

22

mention.

23

title to the Quigley stock prior to the appraisal proceedings.

25

In Woodward the majority shareholder did not acquire

Whereas, in this case, under the applicable Mew York Law, the
mergar and the acquisition ware both accomplished prior to the
6

t

appraisal proceeding,»

For this difference in timing is theonly that we
think we need to address attention.

4
5

Q
didn't it?

The timing

The Eighth Circuit decided this case first?
Am I right?

8

A

Yes, sir.

Q

The Eighth Circuit decision in Woodward was

before this one?
’ A
calendared ae,

I don't recall, Mr. Justice, which came first,
Eot sir; it did not.

11

Q

It did not?

12

A

The timing of the appraisal proceeding with

13

respect to title passage is immaterial.

14

in this case, too, was directly and functionally related to an

15

integral part of the overall proceeding, which was a corporate

18

reorganization.

17

The appraisal proceeding

This was not a causal relationship? it was part and

18

parcel of the overall transaction, the corporate reorganization

19

and, acquisition of the Waldorf shares.

fragmenting of transactions.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MILTON A. LEVENFELD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. LEVENFELD:

25

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

The Government concedes that Hilton’s expenses in

the appraisal proceedings are deductible under Section 162 if
they are not capital costs.
My arguments will be first directed to demonstrate
that the Government's contention is erroneous because the legal,
contractual and economic positions of the second shareholders
8

1

.

change from that of stockholders to creditors when they objected;
to the merger and demanded payment for their stock.

3

I will then show that the merger and the appraisal

4

proceedings were not functionally related.? so the rules with

5

respect to mergers are not applicable to the appraisal pro- .

6

eeeding.
Underlying both arguments will be an analysis of

?

8
9

state law? because without such sar analysis? one does notvknow
.whether an acquisition has occurred.
Q

10

Well? would they have engaged in this process

11

of valuing the shares if they had not been going to acquire

them?

'

Would there have been any occasion for all this expense'*
A

The occasion for the expense was not the merger

itself? Mr. Chief Justice? the occasion for the expense was the
objection and demand for payment by the dissenters and the
failure to agree on price.
Themerger would have been effected in any event?
assuming two-thirds —
Q

I was putting the emphasis on the acquisition

as distinguished from the merger? to the extent that you —
A

The acquisition was not by Hilton, Your Honors

the acquisition was by Waldorf.

The stock ceased to be out­

standing stock of Waldorf at the date of the objection and
demand for payment.

Hilton was not acquiring the stock.

At the time of the objection and demand for payment.

the New York statute specifically provides that the dissenters

ceased to foe shareholders.

3

Well, which was the surviving corporation?

4

Hilton was the surviving corpoation.

But, prior to the merger, upon the dissent, the

6

dissenting shareholders had to dissent prior to the vote for

7

the merger.

Prior to the merger they became creditors of Waldorf.
Hilton assumes the liability of Waldorf as a debtor to the
dissenters by operation of law upon the merger.

Hilton did

not pay in its stock for the dissenting shareholders3 stock.
There was a change of status of the dissenting
shareholders from that of stockholder to that: of creditor.
The only evidence pertinent in the appraisal pro­
ceeding was evidence as to values of shades„ of the shares of
the dissenting shareholders.

There was no evidence introduced,

or which could foe introduced as to the value of the Hilton
shares or to the effectiveness of the merger.
A debtor "-creditor relationship was established be­
tween the dissenters and Waldorf and the debt of Waldorf was
assumed by Hilton by operation of law on the merger.
The relationship of debtor and credit is established
amply by the

-state law and case law citations in our brief.

After the demand for payment and the objection to the
merger, the dissenters had none of the attributes of
10

1

2

stock ownership.

Under state law they could not vote on any

matters relating to the Waldorf or Hilton? they could receive
no dividends from Waldorf or Hilton? they could receive no

3
4

liquidation proceeds»
In addition, it has been cited by a Federal Court

5

6

that once a dissenter elects to receive payment for his stock,
he cannot bring a derivative suit in a capacity as shareholder,

7
even while the appraisal proceeding is in progress.

8
In addition,

the dissenters had all the attributes

9
of sellers of stock, entitled to receive payment for stock.
10
They became,creditors of Waldorf and then Hilton.

Had Hilton

11

become a bankrupt they would have been entitled to receive
12

distributions from Hilton as general creditors, parity to sue
'13

with other general creditors prior to any distribution to the
14
stockholders of Hilton.

15
In addition, this was held in Southern Production
16

Company versus Sobath, cited in our brief.

In addition, the

17
dissenters would have been entitled to the Federal protection
18
of SEC Rule 10(b) relating to full disclosure with respect to
19
the merger, because they would havebeen considered sellers of
20
stock.

And this protection would havebeen afforded to them

21

even while the appraisal proceeding was in progress.

This was

22
decided in the Voega case, cited in our brief.
,23
As prior counsel has brought out, this Court in
.24
Aspey versus Kimball, 221 U.S. would have decided, had Waldorf
25

11

11
2

been a banking corporation and had its shareholders been sub­
ject to additional liability.

This Court decided that such

15

I suppose you could have — could you have

We knew that if they did exercise tfceir rights

we would have had to buy the stock.
Q

18

But if, certainly absent some dissent and ab­

19

sent the acquisition of stock, you wouldn't have made these

20

expenditures ?
A

21

That is correct, Your Honor, after the creation[
'

22

of an obligation on the part of Waldorf, assumed by Hilton to

23

pay for the stock„ the appraisal proceedings would not have

24

been made.

25

The dissenters, when they dissented and demanded

11
I

1

payment, elected tosell their shares under terms . set forth by

2

the State of New York.
The State of New York determined who the parties to

The State of Hew York

could vary the price to be paid for the shares.

This is some­

what 'similar to the situation in Kieselbach versus Commissioner
317 U.So t where this Court said that the purchase price of a
condemnation proceeding is settled as of the date the property
was taken.
The .appraisal proceeding was not part of an acquisi­
tion process because the parties were not negotiating as to a
mutually-acceptable terms as a condition to sale.

This is not

analogous to finding a buyer by paying a broker a commission,
nor is it analogous to the parties bargaining as to the condi­
tion of sale as to purchase price.

Without an agreement to

purchase price, there wouldhave been no sale in the ordinary
circumstance.

In this circumstance the purchase price had been

imposed upon by the State and the sale had been imposed upon

12

1

2

the party by the state once the election was made.
This is not in any way analogous to attorneys pre­

determined by the appraiser.

12
13

Q

The answer is: it probably would be a capital

expense.
The public policy in the State of New York in this,
appears to be very correct, because if the Waldorf dissenters
could resume their status as shareholders, and Hilton stock
were fcohave gone higher, they couldhave taken advantage of the
increase in price of Hilton stock, while in any event, having
& downward protection, because if Hilton stock went lower they

could always have their demand for fair value of their stock.
The fact that the dissenters did not have this choice,
demonstrates ©race again that they ware in a position not as
shareholders when the appraisalproceeding was commenced, but as
14

1

creditors,, and the purpose of the appraisal proceedings was to

2

determine the amount owed to them as creditors.

In summary on this point: the dissenters have sold

3
4

their stock on the date they objected to the merger and de­

5

manded payment for their stock.

S

Waldorf or Hilton as shareholders and they had only the right

7

to receive payment,

The appraisal proceeding was not part of the cost of

acquisition, because the share were acquired prior thereto and

22

the appraisal proceeding had no effect on the acquisition.

23
24
25

Title involvement has always been a necessary element
to determine whether an item

is to be capitalized as being

part of the cost of acquisition, protection or defense of title

15

1

becan.se one cannot acquire title or acquire anything without

z

title being involved,
!

3

Title involvement? this necessary touchstone is

4

absent from the appraisal proceedings? because title to the

5

shares of stock of the dissenters passed from them long before

S

the appraisal proceeding aas started.

1

Most of the Government cases citing the application

8

of the WinmiXl rationale involve title? so the cases cited

9

by the Government are clearly not applicable.

And if the cases

10

didn’t involve title? they involved a recasting of sales price

by a court with respect to a sale induced by fraud.

bargaining process.

Again? a

Or the cases involving the reaching of an agreement

as to price prior to title being passed or the cases involved

in taking the necessary steps to consummate the sale.

case is the case of Petschek, decided by the SEcond Circuit?

18

However*, we all know that in private contracts trying
to accomplish similar ends, different tax consequences can de­
pend upon title.
There is one case in the lower courts, other than
Woodward, in which the appraisal proceedings — the expense of
the appraisal proceedings were held to be deductible.

case,

This is

Boulder Building Corporation and it

was decided under an appraisal statute at 18 Oklahoma Statutes
Annotated 1.161(a) 1953.
I will quote this statute to you x

"Holders of dis­

senting shares of a domestic corporation shall continue to have
all the rights and privileges incident to their shares except
as expressly limited by this section until such time as the
fair value of such shares be agreed upon or determined by a

holders .
The Government says: ignois title when you decide
this case? but one must always be concerned with title if one
is going to impose a capitalisation because title acquisition
is involved.
Hilton does not urge the use of theprimary purpose
test in this case because the sole purpose of the appraisal
proceeding was to determine the value of the shares, the amount
of the debt owed by Hilton and there wasno element of title
involved in the appraisal proceeding.
Q

Well, again, it sounds to me on that argument

that you co”"r ", if you are right, you should be able to deduct
the price that was set in the appraisal.
A

Your Honor, I think there is a distinction be-

tween setting a price and paying a price.
Hilton had agreed to pay a price.

We had agreed

It was a price that was

imposed upon it by state law and the state law had evolved a
procedure to determine the price.

We are questioning -- the

in determining

There is no question that the price itself is —

Title was not involved in the price determination

4
5

procedure.

The title was involved in the acquisition which

6

had occurred before the price-"determining proceeding.
In summary, the expenses of Hilton in the appraisal

7
8

proceeding should not be capitalized because title was not

9

involved in the appraisal proceeding and Hilton acquired nothing

10

as a result of the appraisal proceeding.
In addition,, the appraisal proceedingf having resul­

11
12

ted from the demand for payment and the inability for the

13

debtor-creditor to agree on price was not functionally related

14

to the merger, so the merger rules should not apply.
It is respectfully submitted that Hilton's expenses

15

in the appraisal proceeding are ordinary and necessary expanses
deductible under Section 162 of the Internal KEvenue Code,

We mentioned very briefly the point that Mr. Justice
White has brought out in questioning, that if Hilton felt that
the timing was as important as it is, then we submit that they
could very well have justified, at least arguably, deducting
the cost of price that they paid for the stock, too, because
that cam® before -the acquisition, also.
In fact, we submit that the concession by Hilton that
the pre-merger expenses' incurred, expenditures for the con­
sultant constitutes nondeductible capital expenditures indi­
cates that they, too, feel that the decision in the Woodward
case is correct.
