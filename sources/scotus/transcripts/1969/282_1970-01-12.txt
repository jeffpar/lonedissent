ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,

7

SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

3

MR. GRISWOLD;

9

May it please the Court:

This is a

tax case, what we might call a regular tax case, not a

10

criminal case nor a lien case, as tee last two ware, which

11

comes hers on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals lor j

1?.

the Sixth Circuit.

The

!
The basic factual situation is simple? the statutory j

13
14

provisions are somewhat complex, but I think reduced to a

15

relatively simple problem.
The case .arises with respect to a family corporation

16

17

which was set up in 1945 by Mr. Davis, the taxpayer here and

!0

his partner, a Mr. Bradley.

At that time Bradley had 50 percent

19

of the stock; Davis had 25 percent and Davis's wife had 25

20

percent.

?
;

21

«*■>*>
23
2,4

Now, they sought to borrow $95,000 from the Recon­
struction Finance Corporation, or a subsidiary, tout found that.
they could do so only if the company had more capital.

When

Bradley was unwilling to increase his investment, and so it was

<

25

worked out by Davis acquiring $25, COO in. preferred stock from
2

I?

1

the company for which he paid cash.
Some years later Davis purchased Bradley8s stock and j

2
3

transferred it in equal shares to his son and to his daughter.
j

4

As a result of this transaction the stock was held four ways.

5
6

Dax^is owned 25 percent, his wife 25 percent, his son 25 percent;
j
and his daughter 25 percent. And Davis himself owned all of

7

the preferred stock.

j

Mn June of 1963 the IFC loan was finally paid off,

8
9

and thereafter, on October 1, 1963, pursuant to a corporate

10

resolution, Mr. Davis turned in his preferred stock and re*

n

ceived $25 000 from the corporation and this is the transaction

12

which is at issue here.

Q

13

Is there any question as to whether or not at

14

the time of the reduction of the preferred stock there were

15

earning^ and profits?

16

h

17

Justice.

this c

19

20
2?

22
23
24

25

No; there is not question about that, Mr.

I’here were adequate earnings .arid profits to cover

The point is, whether under the applicable provisions
of the statute, the $25,000 is taxable as a dividend, or whethe;
it was received in exchange for the preferred stock, reuniting
in no tax, since the amount received, $25,000 was the sarnie as
Mr,, Davis's, basis for the preferred stock.
before going further I would like to make it plain
that this is simply a matter of construing a rather specific
3

\
2

somewhat intricate statute»

There is no suggestion of tax

avoidance, or that Mr. Davis set up any sort of a scheme for

3

arfcifically reducing his taxes.

4

§25,000 from the corporation and that he turned in his pre­

3

ferred stock,
The question is: what the tax consequences were and

6
7
8

the circumi stances of this case, and under the applicable
statutory provisions.
lilt's clear, I think, that this is a situation where

9
10

13
U
15

The fact is that he received

Congress had power under the 16th Amendment to impose a tax.,
For that purpose the basic fact is that $25,000 was separated
from the corporation and was received by Mr. Davis, to which 1
may add, as indicated in my response fco Mr. Justice Stewart,
that the corporation had earnings and profits in at least that
amount.
This is not a case like Eisner and Macomber, the

16
dividend case where the taxpayer received only pieces of paper
17
and ended with more pieces of paper representing exactly the
18

same interest that he had before.

Here the shareholder re­

10
ceived cash and had fewer pieces of paper than he had before
2Q
21

that receipt.
t.nd the question is how is receipt of the cash is to

22

be treated for tax purposes.

Basic to the consideration of

23
that question is the provision of Section 318 of the Internal
24
Revenue Code, which is set out at Pages 43 and 44 of the
25

4

t

Government's grey-covered brief, insofar as it is relevant, to

2

this question.

3

This is on® of the two key provisions in the statute

4

and X think that X should read it.

Section 318 at the bottom

’For purposes of those provisions of this subchapter
to which the rules contained in this section are expressly
made applicable -—
11)(A) Mi individual shall be considered as owning
the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for his spouse"
(other than a spouse who is divorced or under a degree of
separate maintenance, which is not applicable here, "and (2)
his children, grandchildren and parents."
Now, under this statute Mr. Davis ’’shall b© con­
sidered," not "may be," or "in proper circumstances,’’ but
"shall be considered," as owning all the stock of the corpora­
tion? ©vein- share, all the common and all the preferred.
Q

Do you suppose that this statute really — this;

attribution provision really means what it says, assuming the
father is 75 years old and the son 50 years old and they haven't
seen each ether for 30 years? one lived in Europe and the otherlived in California; do you suppose there would still be
attribution?
1

Yes, Mr. Justice, because I think the very

purpose of the statute is to remove the questions of decree
25
5

1

which couic be raised by that kind of question»

2

that some lower courts have said that Section 318 should not:

3

be applied where there is evidence of active hostility between

4

the parties.

5

evidence of hostility here, but I would take the ground that.

Congress felt that this was an area which should not be deter­

That is not an issue here? there is no trace of

mined by the facts in each particular case, but really friendly,
and so on, to which there can be infinite variations, but that
it's language as written should be taken as written.
Q

You don't think "children" means minor child­

ren or anything like that?
A

No; 1 am sure that that does not apply.

It

covers parents, too, and is obviously, not limited to minors.
One can say, if they want to, "But he didn't own all
the stock; some was owned by his wife, his son and his daughters
but the fact is that Congress had said specifically that the
tax consequences of what was done here shall be determined by
v.

treating him as the owner of all of the stock.

And for this

purpose, I dhink that those last three words at the very bottom
of Page 43, "shall be considered, without qualification," are
significant,
No suggestion is made, either by the counsel for the
respondent or in the courts below that the provision is not

23
24

valid and I know of no basis on which such a contention could be
successfully made.

This is the way the Congress said the tax

consequences of this sort of a payment out of a. corporation
should be determined.

Bop

3

we start withthe proposition that Mr. Davis is
"

4

to be treated as holding all of the stock of the company, from

5

which he receives $25,000.
Let me point out next that Section 318(b) which is

6
7

about four inches below the top of Page 44, and set out on

8

Page 44 of our brief, specificallyrefers to Section 302 as

That

provision, beginning on Page 39 of our brief.

This is a long

13

out in full there, but most of it, happily, is not applicable

16

here.

Section 302(a)"If a corporation redeems its stock

17

20
21

22
23

24
23

The relevant portions are relatively simple.

(within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if paragraph (1),
(2),

(3), or (4) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption

shall be treated as a distribution in part: or full payment in
exchange for the stock."
Kow, what that means is if you can bring yourself
under paragraphs (1),

(2), (3), or (4) then it will be treated

as a capital transaction and not as a dividend.

And the first

one of those four pargraphs, 302(b)(1), ’Subsection (a) shall
7

j

!

apply if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a

2

dividend."
How, I then refer to Subsections (b)

302(b)(4) relates to stock issued by railroad

302(b)(2) relates to a substantially disproportionate

redemption of stock; and
302(b)(3) related to a redemption which terminates

10
11
12

13

the shareholder’s interest, and it is entirely agreed that
(2),

(3) and (4) are not applicable and this case turns on the

construction of Section 302(b)(1).
We may complete the statutory picture, though there

14

15
16
17
18

21

22

is no controversy about it in this case, by referring to
Section 301 which provides that Section 302 does not apply and
we contend that it does not.

as a dividend to the extent that it is a dividend under Section
316; which means, essentially, whether there are earnings and
profits and Section .316 says that it is a dividend if there are
earnings arid profits.

25

The statutory path is, shall I say,

disorderly and complicated, but I thinkit is relatively clear.
It’s relevant, 1 think, that there is nothing in

avoidance.

These are simply a straightforward series of

provisions designed to say that in certain circumstances a

and taxed as a dividend.

reverse the negative then it would say, '"Subsection (a) which
was treated as a capital transaction, shall not apply if the
redemption is essentially equivalent to a dividend.»
Now, what it says is that Subsection (a) shall apply

11

12

Its meaning becomes clearer, 1 think, if we

if the distribution, if the redemption is not essentially
squivalent to a dividend.

That puts it backwards, 1 think, and

13
14

to me it's clear and 1 don’t think it alters the meaning a
particle if it says that Subsection (a) shall not apply if the

13

redemption is essentially equivalent to a dividemc.
16
Ei.tehr way, the question which we must consider is
O
whether this redemption in this case under the circumstances and

2C

the statutory provisions, was essentially equivalent to a
dividend.
And it is our contention that the transaction here was,

21

In the light of the attribution rules of Section 318, essentially
22

equivalent to a dividend.

It was the payment of money out of a

?.■
corporation to the person who, under Section 318 is to be treated
as owning all of the stock of the corporation, without any

change whatever in his proportionate interest in the corpora­

the stock of the corporation after the payment, such a payment

by a corporation to a shareholder, without any change in pro­

7

courts, essentially equivalent to a dividend.

Section 302(b)(1) is the lineal descendant of a pro­
vision which gees back to 1921. When it was first enacted at

14

The great scheme at that time was that yah

21

no suggesti,on that there was any tax avoidance scheme whatever,

You could organize a corporation with

In 1926 the statutory provision was expanded to re­
cover redemptions without regard to the origin of the stock.
However, that provision which became section 115(g)(1) of the

Internal Revenue Code, was W&gdeS somewhat differently than

respect to stock, which, under the attribution rules, did.not
in any way affect the proportionate ownership in the corpora­
tion, which for tax purposes, pursuant to the express provision
of the statute which represented Congress's statement as to
how transactions of this kind should be treated for tax pur­
poses *
For tax purposes his ownership was 100 percent, both
before and after the transaction.

Nor could this be treated: as

a partial liquidation of the corporation, for that requires some
9

IO

contraction of the business of the company.

Here there was no

contraction of the business: there was simply the payment of
11

$25,000 to the person who, by the clear and express provisions
12
of the taxing statute is to be treated as the sole shareholder
13
inthe company.
!4
Thus, the business purpose, is, we submit, irrelevant.
15
Moreover, though there was a business purpose for issuing the
16
preferred stock,.there was no such purpose for its redemption.

As

17
the taxpayer himself testified in his deposition on Page 17 of
18
the record, this was surplus money.

The transaction was carried

19

out for the benefit of the — of Mr. Davis and not of the company.
20
The distribution of surplus money to the sole shareholder of the
21

corporation is precisely the kind of distribution to which the
dividend rules of Section 301 and 316 are designed to apply.
Surely that would be the result if no stock had been
surrendered, but Eisner and Macomber teaches that the presence or
12

?

absence of a piece of paper representing the same proportion,

2

of interest, inthe corporation, is irrelevant for tax purposes.
here the import,ant fact is that under the provisions of

3
4

taxing statute Mr» Davis owned all of the stock of the corpora™

5

fcion before, the transaction and he owned all of the stock of

o

the corporation after the transaction.

7

tial difference was that he had received $25,000 from the

8

corporation..

A

On the facts of this particular case if ife was
.

subordinate only to the RFC, 1 think maybe the Government might j
have had some difficulty in contending this was an equity,
rather than a debt investment.

It would have had some other

consequences *
!
There is the fact of course here that is is not a debt
and is not claimed to be a debt and we do not think that it can :
be given the consequences of a debt in that transaction, in
that situation.

Whatever

might be the consequences if there

had, in fact, been a. note, rather than stock.
X» the decision below and in other cases and in the
«V

briefs here there is talk about the net effects test and then
the strict net effects test and the flexible net effects test
and X find these phrases confusing and perhaps question-begging,

14

i

1

My own view is that they are irrelevant.

There is no such

2

provision in the statute and the application of the statute

3

becomes unnecessarily complex and confusing, if resort is made \

4

to such terms in the analysis of the problem.
The basic and underlying situation here is that

5
6

Congress has provided that a person in Mr. Davis's situation is;

7

to be treated .as the owner of all of the stock for the purpose

8

of determining how he is to be taxed on the $25,000 which he

9

undoubtedly received from the corporation which had earnings

As I suggested at the time to Mr. Justice Black, if

6
7

he, in fact, owned all the stock himself, there could be no

8

doubt. I suggest that the $25,000 was taxable to him as a
/

9
10
11

dividend, since his proportionate interest was in no way
changed and the presence or absence of pieces of paper in no
way affected the substance of the transaction.
And the statute says that in his situation he is to

12
13
14

be taxed on the basis that all of the shares are attributed to
him.
I have said that I think that Section 302(b)(1) is the

Section 318 means what it says and Congress intended it to mean
what it says and intended not to have individual, factual in­
quiries on a general equitable basis in the construction of
318.

And then I think that the consequence for which we are

contending follows.

It may be somewhat literalistic, but this

is an area, it seems to me, where the tax statute can well be
construed the way it is written in order to both minimize

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

There is an old English saying about not being able to

see the woods for the trees.

And it seems to me that that is

applicable here.
The Solicitor General's argument here would be
exactlythe same if on yesterday Mr. Davis had bought $25,000
worth of preferred stock in this corporation and today had sold
it back and got his money back.
Now, true, he has given up only a piece of paper, but
he has got back exactly the amount of money that he put out.
He put out $25,000 and got the piece of paper.

Now he gives

General that Congress has power under the 16th Amendment., even
if wanted to, to say that that is taxable income.

lj

I don’t

think Congress intended any such result, but if Congress had
intended such a result I think that Eisner versus

Macomber
)

teaches that that would not be treated as income or gain; no
more than if a race horse were involved.

If you have a race

horse —

10

Q

What would_.it be treated as?

A

Treated as a return of capital.

Q

You mean as a sale?

A

Sale.

11
12

That’s what this was; a sale of stock

13

in the corporation, but the minutes provided, the director’s
14

minutes that Mr.Davis offered the stock back to the corporation
15

for $25,000,

The offer was accepted; the stock was bought; the

16

stock was redeemed.

So, everybody was exactly in the same

17

position after the transaction.
18

Taking the transaction as a whole, the two prongs of
19

the transaction, Mr. Davis was in the same position. The corpora­
20

tion had this temporary capital which it had needed in ofcder to
21

get the RFC loan.

The RFC loan was paid off as had been infendec

22
all the time.

The stock was redeemed; the corporation did not

23
need the $25,000 as the Solicitor General states; it was surplus
24
money.

The preferred stock was 6 percent preferred stock.

23

18

This

1

was in 1962 when 6 percent was a good

deal of money and any

2

normal board of directors,, having $25,000 that was not needed

3

in the business and at 6 percent preferred stock outstanding,

4

"would have redeemed the preferred stock,,

5

fit of the corporation»

It was for the bene­

It may have been that Mr. Davis, he probably did want

6
7

his $25,000 back since the purpose for which he had turned it

8

in to the corporation had been served, but he is at the end of

11

this two-prong transaction, exactly where he started with his
money back.

and not other dividends.
hs I stated, if the key transactions had occurred one

12
13
14
15

day after the other, according to the Solicitor General’s
argument, this would be a dividend merely because of the
existence of earnings and profits.

So, he

A

He preferred not to do it because that made

the balance sheet better off for his purposes in general.

In

other words, you didn’t have that debt on the balance sheet.

If

all appeared to be equity capital, which it was.
Now, there have been a numberof cases where this veryj

18
IS
20
21

22
23
24
25

same thing happened and the lower courts have uniformly held
to the taxpayer that where there was a temporary advance of
equity capital to a corporation for a limited purpose and for
a limited time, with the understanding that, the stock would be
redeemed when that purpose had been served, that is a return of
capital.

They have used the phrase "business purpose."
Now, I think one court did say, and the Solicitor

20

1

General has used the argument that where there is a business

2

purpose in .issuing the stock in the first place, that the

3

redemption of the stock is not a business purpose.

4

But I don't

think you can view the entire transaction of this kind as in

5

isolationi view the redemption in isolation from the original

issuance of stock.

transaction or a two-prongs, as I have said, of a transaction.
Now, I will have to agree that this net effect test

I believe the Solicitor'General advanced that

25

The reason the net effects test, the strict net

the case that Mr. Griswold tried when he was in private prac­
tice

the Bedford Estate case, in whichfchis Court reversed the

Second Circuit.

Thereupon, the Second Circuit Court of

Appeals in the Bedford Estate case had nothing to do with a
stock redemption.

It involved boot in a reorganisation case anc

the Second Circuit had held that this boot was a return of
capital and not a dividend.

This Court held that it was a

dividend under the provision of the statute which used the
words, "effeet."
Whereupon, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals said,
"Uh huh, the; Supreme Court has now reversed all of our failure
decisions in redemption, cases, “ .so from there on the Second
Circuit has followed what they call this state net effect test,
saying that the Bedford decision had overruled their prior
21

1

decisions,., when it. didn't do any such thing.
And,- even as late as the Leviri case

2

year or year*

3

before last, the Second Circuit of Appeals repeated their

4

statement that the Bedford case had overruled their prior

5
6

j

decisions where they,had followed the same, or a different rule
regarding redemptions.

7

The Second Circuit, in the Snihe case, which is

8

cited in our brief, pointed! out very clearly that the two'

3

situations are entirely different.
Naw, the legislative history of this section 302(b)(1)

10

It

states as specifically as it could be stated that what Congress

12

intending to do in 302(b)(1) was to revert in part, to existing

13

law under Section 115(g

So, Congress said — -the Senate Committee said that

14
15
16
17
18

20
21
22

of the old 1939 Goldwynne.

they were restoring that to the House Bill which had left out
the essentially equivalent test.

They were restoring this

essentially equivalent dividend test*.

B&t the Courts, going

back to existing law so that a taxpayer who could not come
within one of these so-called "safe, harbor" provisions of the
new code, the ones that we agree are not applicable here.

If he

could not come within one of them, he could still rely on the
fact that hi s redemption was not essentially equivalent to a
dividend.

24
25

Nothing can be Clearer, it seems to me that the state­
ment several times in the Senate Committee Report that that was
22

1

what was being done.

The original House Bill had left out this

2

essentially equivalent test arid only provided these mechanical

3

tests based on ownership of stock»

4

if the shareholders s interest was terminated or if there: was a

5

disproportionate redemption, he could, by following these tech­

6

nical rules, escape dividend treatment.

The provisions being that

Now, those safe harbor provisions are where the owner­

7

8

ship ©scaped dividend treatment.

9

provisions are referred to ownership of stock.

10

11

14
15
‘16

be followed in determining the ownership of stock.
Well, the Senate Committee kept that provision about
determining the ownership, the attribution rules for determining
the ownership of stock, but then puts back into the new 1954
Code the old 1939 provision aboiat. essentially equivalent to the
dividend.
We say that these attribution rules were not intended

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And the House

Bill had in it these attribution rules which, it said, should

12
13

Now, those safe harbor

by Congress to apply to the essentially equivalent to a dividend
'

test.

They were intended to apply for the purposes of deter­

mining ownership in those provisions where: ownership of stock
was mentioned; and there was no mention of ownership of stock
in Section 302(b)(1).
So, while the lower courts said .floNo, this section
was pretty broad."

They said, for the purposes of this section

we’ll say that the attribution rules appdly here, but even thougJ
23

1

they do apply, this particular redemption is okay because of

2

the business purpose rule»

3

Now, in one place, in one respect I think I must

4

agree wholeheartedly with the Solicitor General and that is

5

that these attribution rules either apply or they don't apply» j

6

You can't say that they apply where father and son love each

t|
It would create interminable difficulty

in finding out when the attribution rules do apply and when the]
don't apply.
But, I say they don't apply at all with respect to
Section 302(b)(1) because that was the old test from the 1939
Code when there were no attribution rules.

And in every state-

ment in the Senate Committee Report, saying what they were
trying to do, it was specifically stated that they were rever­
ting to existing law and no qualification based on these
attribution rules»
So —
Q

Mr, Waller, you say that the attribution, that

Section 318 attribution provisions do not apply to this case?
A

Do not apply,

Q

Now, why is it?

A

For this reason, Your Honors

The Section 318

I think, is ambiguous in this respect, because it says "Section
24

1

318(a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for

2

purposes of this section.5’

3

we didn't have any legislative history? if we didn't have a

4

question of constitutional balance raised, that probably one;

5

would say that it applies for the purposes of the old section,

6

including 202 (b) (1).

7

Now, 1 would have to agree that if

tut, if you look at the sequence of events by which

8

this partic ular section got into the 1954 Code I think it * s

3

perfectly plain that what Congress was saying was that these

10

attribution rules should apply in determining ownership of

1?

stock for the purposes of these provisions of the Section where

12

ownership cf stock is mentioned, namely:

13

3, but not Section 1, I mean Subsection (1} of Section 2.

20
21

13

Senate Committee Reports to find out what they meant.

When we

do go to the Senate Committee Reports, I think it's

C

Has any court ever accepted this argument?

i-.

No? no court has accepted it wholeheartedly.

They have only said, "We think there ought to be exceptions
where there is family estrangement and other things like that.1'

C

Well, that’s not your argument here at all.

P

That's right.

I agree with the Solicitor

General that it either applies or it doesn’t apply? and 1 say
that it does apply and he says that it doesn't apply.

Q

Then, what did the Court of Appeals hold?

A

They held with us that this was a return of

The District Court, held it was a

that it was a return of capital and not a dividend, and we are

Mr. Waller, is there a difference between

to argue for one as well as the other.

13
14

I don't see that there is any real difference in

Q

Well, I don't want, to

make you do that.

A

Because — in 1926 when the statute was amended

the — it was apparent from the reports of the legislative- '
committees there that what they had in mind was taxing a pro
rata redemption of common stock.

In other words, that, have got

an equal amount of common stock and redeemed 10 percent of each
one.

That's essentially equivalent to a dividend.
Now, of course, that could apply here only by virtue

of the attribution rules, because without the attribution rules,
Mr. Davis araed only 25 percent ofthe common stock.

His wife

owned 25 percent and his two adult children, who were certainly

not his dummies in any way, even though the

may have been

family solidarity as distinguished from estrangement.

4

board of directors could redeem this stock if Mr. Davis hadn’t j

wanted it r«adeemed, as far as that’s concerned.

They

They could

6

have outvoted him.
j
So, the

7

it’s not correct to say that this redemp­

8

tion was strictly for the benefit of Mr. Davis. It was for the

9

benefit of the corporation to get rid of a 6 percent preferred

j

10

stock in X9S3.

It wouldn’t be today if anybody had some 6 per­

But in 1963 the situation was entirely different.
