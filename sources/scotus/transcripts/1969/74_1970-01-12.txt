ORAL ARGUMENT BY BERNARD DUNAU, ESQ. ON

S

BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DUNAUs

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

8

Court:

This case can be put in a nutshell.

Picketing takes

9

place in front of a store to support a strike by that store3s

v-

10

employees to obtain a satisfactory collective bargaining agree­

11

ment .

12

The picketing is prohibited by an injunction as a

13

trespass because it takes place on a sidewalk which, though

14

publicly used, is privately owned.

15

We have three questions:

First, that the prohibition

16

violates the First Amendment; second: Is the controversy outside

17

the jurisdiction of the State Court because the subject matter

18

is preempted by the National Labor Relations Board, and third:

19

If the State Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, does the

20

prohibitior conflict with the Federally-protected right guaran­

21

teed by Section 7 of the Act to engage in the National Labor

22

Relations Act to engage in concerted activity for mutual aid

23

or protection.

24

Q

That’s a pretty large nutshell.

Suppose a group of people wanted to have a

demonstration in favor of the Vietnam Wan could they hold it

h

8

We do not have in this case, the question

whether when you have a public situs you may have picketing or
9
other demonstrations or other exercise of free speech with
10

respect to a matter not connected to that situs.

In our case

u
we had a situation in which the protest is related to the
12
operation of the shopping center and therefore we do not have to,
13
and we should not reach in this case, the question

of whether,

14
when the situs is public, but the protest relates to a matter

15
other than the situs, whether the locus is appropriate for the
16
expression of free•amendment rights.

17
The Second Circuit has decided that it was.

1

18
believe the California Supreme Court has also decided- that it
!9
makes no difference,that we do not have that question in this

20
case.

21
The storey here begins on December-19, 1963. ' The
union filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board
to be certified as the representative of the store's employees.
On April 16,

*64, the union was certified as the representative.

nine discriminatory discharges from a group of 40 or 50

employees and their refusal to bargain in in good faith.

5

ing, sustaining the complaint in full.

What kind of an injunction was that, temporary

or permanent?

A.

16

At that time it was a temporary injunction?

17

then on two months later it was continued until further xnodifi

18

cation in accordance with due process of lav?.

19

from a nonevidentiary hearing two months later the injunction

20

was to continue indefinitely unless terminated or modified by

21

the Court,

22

Q

And that was still by its terras, a temporary

23

injunction? wasn't it?

24

A

25

In other words,

I don81 know how one would characterize an

injunction which is continued indefinitely, sir.

6

\

Q

How did the Court characterise it?

2

A

It did not. It's the identical injunction that

3

was before this Court in Logan Valley.

4

Federal questions ? there is nothing that can go back to the

5

Alabama Supreme Court with respect to any Federal question.

6

In addition, since there is a substantial question of preemp­

7

tion presented in this case, whether or not the injunction

8

would be termed final within this Court's meaning of that term,

3

would not make any difference, because withssspect to a pre­

10

emptive question we can get here on a temporary as well as a

permanent injunction.

But, for the purposes of this Court's;

C!

You say that when the question is one of pre­

emption that the rule

that there must be a final judgment,

in a state court goes out the window?
P.

Ho, sir; I don't say that the rule that there

must be a final judgment is eliminated, but the final judgment
rule is satisfied in a case or preemption by an order which is,
in form, temporary.
0

That meets the final judgment ruling.

What's your authority for that?

Well, never

mind; if it's in your brief I can find it.

Yes, it's in the brief, Your Honor.

I can find it then, don't, take the time.

Q

Does the same labor union still represent

these employees?
P

Well, there has been, since the certification,

2!

a change ir ownership so that the store which was originally

22

involved, row instead of operating the store, has leasee, its

23
24
25

premises to two others.

Whether that lease of the premises and

the change of ownership has affected the NLRB certification, is
itself a substantial question.

But the labor organisation as
8

i

I

such, still exists and it still represents employees in this

3

organizational or other picketing with respect to the stores

which are now within that shopping center.

of the stores which are presently occupying the premises.

Well, now, you say "within the general locals» '

It remains Weinaeker's property;

there are stores functioning on WEinacker3s property.

At any

time when it becomes appropriate to picket those stores or to
handbill those stores this injunction precludes entry into the
property fcr that purpose and we have and continue to have a
live controversy.
Nowg I said that in our view Logan Valley controls

24

this case.

The essence of Logan Valley, as we see it, is that

To us it seems that the only viable standard can be

I

The Supreme Court of Alabama seems to think

2

that Logan Valley involved a "shopping center/’ and that this

case does not involve a shopping center,,
!
A

4

Well? it seems to say not that this case does

S

not involve a shopping center, but that it involves a smaller

6

shopping center.

7

only one store operating, so of course it is a clear distinction

8

between a on©"store operation and a shopping center which has
more than on® store.

14

At the present time there are, in fact, two stores
operating on that property so we have a shopping center in

Yes, sir? but we need to remember that insofar

as that aspect of the case is concerned, in Logan Valley the
action was brought both by the lessor and by the store operator
and no one ever suggested that the lessor did not have an
adequate interest to preclude entry upon that property.

The very fact that the Federation in

It put it this way in its amicus brief;
"Such retail establishments have in* common

with large shopping centers a desire to maximize the accessi™
bilifcy of the public to their premises.

It is an integral com­

ponent of every retail business that it be freely open to the
public.

And therefore, our position as to whether the open

property happens to be smaller or larger cannot be the eriteriosi
So long as it's open, then it has to L

open to employees to

publicise thesdlsBavopolafcor policy of a particular employer
operating within the real estate."

'

'
Mow, in this case I think this is particularly plain,
because here we have employees of that very store who want to
■
picket or handbill and. are barred from these very premises.

Now, when they are working for that store they are parking theilc
car on that parking lot, they are using those walkways and
they are entering the same entrance in order to get to work.
Now, it doesn’t seem to us that those employees, when they are j
dissatisfied with the employment terns, become trespassers
instead of invitees, when they park their car on"that same
parking lot, walk over the same walkways, but this time picket i
in front of the store.

You don’t become a tresspasser rather ‘

than an invitee when you change from a working employee to a
striking employee.
It was held by the Alabama Supreme Court that picket­

It

12

ing is more than speech.

Sure it’s more than speech, but it was;

more than speech in Logan Valley, as well.

And "more than

13
14

speech"' means only that the patrol in front of the store may be
regulated with respect to the number of pickets, if there are

15
too many there or if they are too close to the doorway and in­
16
terfere with the ingress and egress, then you tell them to get
1?
away from the doorway and picket on the far side.of the side­
1.8
walk,

That's what we mean by fee regulation of the plus aspect

|

19
of picketing? we do not mean that you can ban it altogether from

20
an otherwise appropriate open place.
21
It is suggested in this case that there was actually
22
obstructive picketing.

We’ll pass the question whether on this j

23

i

record it. is possible for anyone to say there was obstructive
24
picketing.

There were six identically-worded affidavits which

23
14

t
;

1

which said there was obstructive picketing.

There was an

2

answer filed by the union which said there was so obstructive

3

picketing, sworn to by two officers of the union.

5

two paper swearers on the other, one could ever find a fact one.

You need an evidentiary hearing.

But, suppose — suppose there was obstructive picket­

7
8

ing in that case, all that that would authorise would be the

9

elimination of the instruction; not the elimination of picketing;

10

and that's the point of this case here.
The Court says, the Alabama Suprema.Court, "It-doesn't

1!

12

look to us as if the picketing at. the entrance to the- parking
■

13

tion.

17

because there are other places as well that want to exercise

free speech rights.

If a place is otherwise appropriate for the exercise of

But, if one is to look to comparative effectiveness

20

it's perfectly clear that the picketing and handbilling cannot

2,1

possibly be nearly as effective at the entrance to theparking
lot as it is at the front of the store.
First of all, with respect to handbilling.

I don't

care how slowly a car moves from a public street through an en­
trance into a parking lot, it’s still moving.

You cannot very

1

well distribute handbills to a moving- vehicle and you sure

£

can't distribute handbills to a moving Vehicle on a cold day

when those windows are up tight, and no one is lowering windows

Where did the picketing take place?

A

As far as Xem able to ascertain from the

opinions of the Court in the record, it took place on the side­

parking lot as well as the sidewalk directly in front of the
main entrance to the store, building.

sole contention before the court below.

16

Q

What are you claitaing here that the court had

a right to enjoin?
A

At what place?

I claim that the court in precluding the

17

pickets from coming onto this limited property, were within

19

their jurisdiction and acted properly and they had the right to

19

move the pickets, in effect,, 100 feet away by moving them out

20

to a public sidewalk, a safe and proximate place to stand, only

21

100 feet from the front door of the Respondent's premises.

22
23

I understood you to say that the court en­

joined picketing on a public sidewalk„

Within that parking lot and on the Petitioner's

They are moved 100 feet by this injunction that is presently

21

22
23
24

25

pending.
Now, our contention is that this is private property,
by virtue of the fact that, unlike Petitioner8s claim, we do
not believe that openness to the public is the only viable
28

Standard.

That principle brings us smack into a dichotomy

with their position on no claim- to coming into the store
itself .

The same standard being 'applied in the two circum-"

stances; the store and the parking lot, would allow the pickets;
into the store.

This is not a reasonable standard, and this is

not, in our opinion, what the court in its decision in Logan
Valley, calling private property quasi-public or available for .
public use or open to thepublic.
il

In that case, as well as in the case of Marsh versus
■

Alabama, it wasn’t the openness to the public which was the
sole standard; it was the use by the public in a particular
way.

The public used the property in the previous cases as a

sidewalk; e.s a park, as a thoroughfare to go from one place to
another, or as the Court said in Logan Valley, "freely open to
the public in the area and those passing through,"
The parking lot in this store is not freely open to
the public and those passing through.

The difficulty here is that it is not in the

record; is it?
A

Oh, yes,

Oh, there is no statement in the

record that the general public does not use this property.

The

only statement inthe record is that it’s private property and as
private property, without an indication that it is used as a

29

1

public thoroughfare, the fact that there is a public thorough­

2

fare directly adjacent to it, a public sidewalk directly ad­

people who came to buy in the store.

indicates that there's no store windows? there is no entrances

The major contention in support of a finding that

there was jurisdiction in the Alabama Supreme Court, is that
once they have concluded that there was no impairment of First
Amendment rights and once the Court has concluded that the
property rights of the Respondent to conduct its lawful business,
are being jeopardised by the conduct of the Petitioners, the
court below has coirie to the conclusion that Petitioners are
engaging in an unlawful act,
'Once that conclusion is reached, and properly so, if...

They found that it would not interfere with the First Amendment

7

it would seriously impair the operation of Respondent to allow

We would be entitled, even on the assumption of

Weinacker, because the obstructive picketing would authorize
only enough injunction reaching the obstruction,, not the
elimination of picketing.
