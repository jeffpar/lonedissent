ORAL ARGUMENT BY MERVYN HAMBURG, ESQ.

Mr. Hamburg, Number 17,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. HAMBURG;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

7

Court, the issue involved in this case is related to the pre­

8

ceding one in that it involves a prosecution under 18 U.S.C.

3

1.0011 for making false statements and purported compliance with

10

11

other statutes.
In this case certain sections of the Internal Revenue

12

Code relating to \7age~earned taxes.

13

whether an individual may properly assert the privilege against

14

self-incrimination as a complete defense to a charge of making

15

false statement on wage income tax returns.

The precise issue here is

16

The District Court in the Western District of Texas

17

held that the privilege was such a defense and dismissed false

18

statement charges against the Appellee, James Knox®

19

is here on the Government's appeal of that dismissal.

20

The case

The indictment was filed before this Court decided

21

the Marchetti and Grosso cases.

This indictment charged the

22

Appellee with four counts of failing to file wage income tax

23

returns; that is Form 11-C, a copy of which we have included

24

in our appendix; and with failure to pay the special occupa-

25

tional tax covering periods prior to October 15, 1965.

2

1

The indictment also contained two counts s counts

2

five and six, which charged that the Appellee made false state

3

ments on the returns which he did file on October 14, and on

4

October 15, 1965s the statements being that he declared under

5

penalties of perjury that the returns were, to the best of his

6

knowledge, true, correct and complete, whereas in truth, they

7

were not and that the number of employees he had claimed had

S

been understated and misrepresented»

9

Now, prior to trial the Court decided Marchetti

10

versus the United States and Grosso versus the United States

It

and in those cases this Court recognized that -an individual.

12

charged with failing to file wage-earned tax forms, which

13

invariably contained information incriminating him undex- other

14

lav/s, could properly assert that privilege — the privilege

15

against salf-incrimination as a completa defense.

16

moved to dismiss all of_the charges against him, including

17

Counts 5 and 6e the fals

22

effect, that their validity held not been affected by Marchetti

23

and-Grosso.

24
25

And as to those counts, it argued, in

The District Court disagreed with the Government’s
position and in a brief memorandum dated July 24, .1968, the

3

1

Court — that Court held that the constitutional privilege

2

against self-incrimination prevents prosecution for failure to
answer the form in any respect.

kJ

Judge Roberts relied upon

4

Grosso in particular, but charges conspiracy to evade payment

5

of the excise tax on wage-earnings, was dismissed, along with

S

the substantive -charges of failing to pay the excise tax and

7

failing to pay the special occupational tax.

8

In the Government’s view, Judge Roberts misinter­

9

preted and misapplied the Court's decision, particularly

10

Grosso.

n

discussion of the difference between Grosso and this situation.

12

.

Thus, I believe it to be appropriate to begin with a

In Grosso the Court held that a conspiracy charge

13

had to fall with other counts, since it was bottomed (?) solely

14

on allegations of evasionof the excise and ocupational taxes.

15

In the Court's words, the conspiracy raised? "questions

16

identical with those presented by the substantive counsel."
'V

17

In contrast to Grosso, the Falst Statement counts

18

are not identical? they’re not even similar to the charge of

19

failure to file wage earned income-tax returns or pay the tax.

20

Now, we no longer contest the privilege against self-incrimina­

21

tion as an appropriate defense for one charged with failure to

22

file5 we don’t believe that that privilege protects an indepen­

23

dent act of making a false statement on the form which the

24

Appellee did, in feet, file.

25

In other words, the problem of incrimination arises

4

1
2

at the threshhold when one decides whether or not to file* and
i f he files,, perhaps he might face prosecution under some

3

state gambling laws or if he fails to file;, prosecution under

4

a Federal Statute.

5

The Appellee here resolved this question of whether

6

to stands on his privilege or not.

7

what we believe to be the customary means by which statutes

8

are challenged by noncompliance; instead, he purported to

9

comply, and in this purported compliance, he lied.

He didn’t avail himself of

He is now

10

charged with a substantive offense of making false statements

11

in violation of a statute having no connection with the Wage»’

12

earned tax laws, except insofar-as the tax laws form the frame­

13

work within which the Appellee committed violations of the

14

fully distinct criminal statute.

>

15
16
17

Thus, in our view, the Fifth Amendment privilege
should not have controlled the outcome of the case in the
> District Court.

Our stand is not novel* by any meansi a

18

number of cases cited in the previous case argued here, begin­

19

ning with Kapp and Kay, also cited id our brief, have been

20

controlled by rationale similar to the one we urge here.

21

Q

(Inaudible)

22

A

If it. did. Your Honor, it certainly didn3t

23
24
25

mention it in its brief in any way in its opinion.
Q

Do you know whether it was cited inthe lower

court or not?
5

i

A

As a matter of fact, it was not cited to the

2

lower court.

3

Q

It had been decided, though, hadn’t it?

4

A

I believe so; yes.

But I don*fc believe the

3

Government in its reply inthe District Court cited any of the

6

cases heres Kapp or Kay or Dennis.
Q

7
8

So, instead of being considered in the

District Court in the light of Dermis?
A

9

Except insofar as Dennis has been decided, and

10

I assumed that the Court was aware of the holding of Dennis.

IS

Moreover, certainly the same principles of Dennis had been

m

used and applied in Kapp and Kay, insofar as this situation is

13

concerned.

14

stitutionality of the underlying statutes doesn’t excuse a

15

16
17
13

These cases holding that the claim of the uncon-

calculated, deliberate course of perjury or fraud or deceit.
In this case, by the way, of course, we are not
dealing with a claim that the underlying statute is uncon­
stitutional; we're only dealing with a privilege against self­

19

incrimination.

20

the lawful process — time-test process of raising it when he

22
23
24
25

He could properly assert this privilege by

failed to comply and that defense is all that Marchetti and
Grosso established.

But if .an underlying statute can't be

attached on constitutional grounds, certainly an individual
shouldn’t be heard to raise a constitutional privilege; a
situation where he purported to comply with the law.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY J„ EDWIN SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SMITH?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
10

1

Court, to touch just briefly in the beginning on the point that

2

was discussed as to the contents of the indictment and to make

3

the specific that we submit that the defense is not charged

4

when you charge only that you failed to make

5

something on one of the Government’s forms; but. it is not a

6

false statement just by omitting this particular question»

7

a reading of the indictment will disclose that’s all that the

Government charged»iThey didn’t charge.

Q

13
14

The District Court didn’t decide that case on

that ground, though% did they?
A

15

That one is affirmative —» ruling opinion;

16

no, sir.

The point was raised in the motion to challenge the

17

indictment that the indictment did not state an offense, but

18

we urge in our brief here that two state authorities — not any

19

Federal,but the only ones we could find— that the charge is not

20

a false statement.

itself.

If you look at it, it does not cite any offense.
Q

22

And from that point we submit 'the indictment

So, isn’t our examination here on direct

23

appeal limited to decide the issue that the District Judge de™

24

cided.

25

It’s true, that if l.e had debided that the indictment

•should have been dismissed because of construction of the
11

'2

i

statute, maybe that issue could have come here too, but that

2

isn’t what he decided,
A

3

But that's why 1 would believe that any time

4

a criminal defendant can challenge the sufficiency of the

indictment,

rules, but I think that could b eraised most any time,

I may be wrong on my particular phase of the

Q

The question of

our jurisdiction under the direct -A

That may be.

I’ll be frank with you.

I

couldn’t answer the question as to your jurisdiction.

I!

Q

I would think that’s true, though.

12

A

And if I may intone to the question of the

13

constitutionality problem involved here.

14

Government in its position here has wholly failed to recognise

15

that if the statement made assuming he made a false statement

16

was made, it was made under the compulsion of criminal sanction:;

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

if he didn’t make a statement.

And I think that the

And this Court has held that

the -•» in Marchetti and Grosso that its tar. statutes are uncon­
stitutional; that to require they file these stamp tax returns,
informational returns, is a violation of

the Fifth Amendment

immunity against self incrimination.
Now, this poses a very fundamental point as to
whether the United States Government can, by

use of an

constitutional statute which deprives a man of his Fifth
Amendment immunity when he — in compelling him to do that under

12

1

the threat of criminal prosecution* then turn around and prose­

2

cute him under 1.001 if he makes a false statement in that

■o

coerced information.

4

I agree with Your Honor on that point*: Mr. Justice*

5

and I have urged explicitly in ray brief from the very beginning

6

that I think the Government in this situation comes before this

7

Court and this prosecution* with unclean hands.

8

9
10

Q

Well* Mr. Smith* as a matter of coercion* he

had another problem.

He could have gotten out of the gambling

business* couldn’t he?

11

A

He could have done that; yes* sir* but the

12

constitution says even if you have committed a crime* a most

13

vile crime* you can’t be compelled to give information incrim­

14

inating yourself.

Q

15
16

if he

had stopped

garbling*

A

You mean had he stopped gambling since he

filed that return?

1©

Q

Around about the same time.

20

A

I doubt it.

21

he is still gambling or not,

22

Justice.

23

the Government

wouldn't have prosecuted* would they?

17
18

But

Q

I doubt it.

I don’t know whether

I don’t know about that* Mr.

What about this point about the Government’s

24

position that the photostats here would clear up the indictment

25

and that if he goes back to trial they may be available to you

13

1

for whatever use and does that help the point about the indict­

2

ment not being quite crystal clear?

3

A

I don’t think that exhibit helps the indictmen

4

because I think it you have got to look at the indictment on

S

what it says.

And this is something that —

6

Q

What the indictment says in the light of that.

7

A

I would say thiss that the indictment whan it

8

says that he is guilty of 1001 because he failed to answer a

9

question doesn’t charge a false statement,

10

I don’t think you

can be guilty of a false statement by not making an answer.

11

Q

Has anybody brought that question up, sir?

12

A

I raise it in my brief.

13

Q

I know,, but you can’t raise it first in a

14

brief.

It must be raised in accordance with the established

15

rules.

You have a case here decided on a constitutional point,

16

not on the insufficiency of the indictment.
A

n

As I believe Mr. Justice mentioned a while ago
'r "

18

, and was making the point about ;the jurisdiction of the Court,

19

I was trying to answer this.

20

'

Q

VTell, shouldn’t we be focusing on the constitu­

21

tional issue only here?

22

A

23
24
25

This point of it not stating the offense was

raised in challenges to tfya indictment at the trial level.
But under the constitutional question I
emphasize here that there was & coercion statute here of the

14

1

Government, of this man being required to file this return or

2

if he didn’t file it, be faced with prosecution, $10,000 fine

3

and prison»
Here is the Government saying; you do this; you file

4
5

this thing; you give us the incriminating information or we'll

6

prosecute you for not giving it under 7203

7

with a $10,000 fine.
But if you come around and give us some incriminating

8
9
10

and punish you

evidence, however, and it’s quite true, we will then prosecute
you under 1001.

1?

Q

But, when did he file?

12

A

Oh, this was back in 364, I think.

Q

Well, when the Government was putting that

13
14
15

kind of coercion on him, why, the obligation to file had been
upheld in this Court.

16

17
18

21

22
23
24
25

A

This is correct.

Q

So, the Government, did they have such dirty

hands at 'that time?
A

19
20

When did he file?

Well, Mr, Justice I think that the situation
*

there was that the issue of compelling to give

information

—” incriminating information was being held in the situation
of Kahriger and Lewis that this was one of the compulsive
points that hi3 having to file — it was the rule that bore
on his having to file or be prosecuted under 7203 for not
filing.

activity, but in this particular case Knox has raised the issuej

5

at the vary moment at trial level that challenged the indict™

6

ment* and this Court has had in Grosso and in Covington, I

7

believe, in Leary, Marchetti, all of those, that this challenge

8

raised by motion to challenge the indictment is unquestionably

9

timely.

10

11

I believe that’s expressed time after time by the

authors of those opinions.
And as to coercion, I think that this appeal here

12

should be written, if I may so suggest, in the lines of Garrity

13

and the Spivak decisions.

14
15
16

Q

Would you clarify this for me: what forced him

to file this return?
A

I would suggest this, if it please the Court,

17

here is a man that has a situation if he doesn't file this

18

return he is threatened with criminal prosecution under

19

Ai"ticle 26, Section 7203.

20
21

Q

Well, isn’t that coupled with something else

if he doesn’t file it and does something else affirmatively?

22

A

His willful failure to file is the offense.

I believe this Court rejected that concept in

overruling Kahriger and Lewis when it.came with Marchetti and
Grosso.
Q

I don't quite read those cases that way.

You

go right ahead with your argument.
A

But the point I am trying to make is this?

that under the rulings of Garrity and Spivak, he had the choice
here either to file or to be prosecuted and the Garrity case
I believe this Court held that where the situation was such that
you had the choice between losing your job or giving the in-»
criminating information that that was coercion.
Q

Oh, but he r ally had the third alternative

that you say was rejected by this Court but with which I don't
agree -- he had the alternative of going out of the illegal
gambling business, didn't he?
A

Yes, he had the third alternative of going

not to gamble, you know.

And I can understand that in filing

this return, but at the same time in Garrity they held the

Don’t you have to in order to prevail here?

No, sir, Mr, Justice.

Q

Why not?

8

I submit this, that when the Government re-^

9
10

quires an act in violation of its own fundamenta], role, re­
quires you to file a return that violates the Government's own
constitution then then —

11

it a crime to take advantage of the Bill of Rights, and not

incriminate"himself.; not incriminate himself.

17

19

21

May I answer that by saying on your assumption

that you are free to commit any crime you want to, if you call

15

18

you want

to, including perjury.

14

16

Then you are free to commit any

*

And if he either had to file this statement and
admit that he was-guilty or commit .perjury, that's what the

Government saids if ^ou are doing this you have got tc report
it.

And that, so far as I am concerned, is pretty good

coercion.

And it may be that the Government has a right to

22
coerce him into doing it, but I don't see how it can be argued
23

they didn’t coerce him into doing it.
24
25

A

And then you see the coercion or the

21

1

informational return must be aligned along with 1001, to give

2

the information as to his incriminating activities.

3

might make this — sort of emphasize here and it may be too

4

much;, but I think it*s mentioned in say briefs assuming that we

5

were coercing the man to make his statement and as this Court

6

did in Garrity* relate this to the physical torture fa5' illus­

7

tration* and stretch him on the rack or you can put him down

8

with a thumb screw or something of that kind until he makes' a

V

'statement.

You coerce it by physical torture,'

And I

I'hen* in

10

trying to get relief from the physical torture* he makes some

ii

false statements in the answer ha gives to the police,
Now* in that analogy* I would ask the Government

12

would they prosecute him under those circumstances for the —

13

and I think this Court has.pointed out in a number of opinions;

14

Garrity I believe* is the latest* that there is no objection to

15

physical torture but the refinement at times it affects.

16

17

And

that when the individual citizen is faced with the issue of

whether or not he files one of these informational returns-.1
or as to run the gamble of being prosecuted by the United States:
District Attorney for not filing it* and prior to Grosso and
Marchetti they were filed every day? every week* by,the hundreds
over the months* sir,

I think that gets into the question of

coercion.
And there is just as much coercion as there was in
*

Garrity; just as much coercion as there was in Spivak in this

situation*,
Q

Of course the Government's capacity, or at

3

least the Court hasn5t said yet that the Government is not

4

entitled to collect the tax?

5

No, I am not arguing that here, Mr. Justice.

Well, but he filed and said he had three

employees instead of five.

excluding them from evidence. And, under those circumstances.

also, that when the evidence would not be available that you

could take it and deal with it on appeal hare at this Court to

conclude it under the — tha substantial justice of the case.

This is not a matter of retroactivity.

We have

raised this issue from -the inception and we submit that it is
right for decision and that the ~~
This sort of also gets back in a way to this Court's
older opinion in Brown versus the United States, which is
reemphasized in Garrity and Spivak, of the situation where,
when the Government by unconstitutional means, causes a man to
do something or forces him to do something, they require him to
do this under criminal circumstances.
1 think that distingui -nes these from Dennis and Kay
and Kapp and that line of case, you see.

Those cases did not

have the criminal sanction in saying that in the very inception
you have got to come do this.
And I think this Court could well a£find(?5 and in
no way overrule Kapp, Dennis or -- because this man has standing
here in the sense that he has brought this issue from the in­
ception of the trial and all of the decisions this Court has
24

1

held that the issue is timely when raised as a challenge to the

I mighte just in concluding make one sort of

3

ancillary points that this Court has repeatedly held that the

False Statement Statutes were enacted for the purpose of pro!

tecting the Government —- the authorised functions of Government;

I believe the way it is expressed — I submit that that the ex-

Court 'where you haveheld that when the Govern­

mental official took an oath* or the tribunal requiring the
oatha was not authorised to require the oath*, that you — there
could be no charge of perjury, in cases such as Christoffel,
the Viereck

case, United States against George, the United

States versus Williams and others,
Q

Do you have those cases down in your brief?

A

On Page 10 of Section 3,

It is there.

The Internal Revenue Service was forbidden by the
Constitution to require this information.

Now, the Fifth Amend­

ment was forbidden as you have ,held in Grosso and Marchetti,
consequently those cases of Christoffel versus the United States,
:/iereck versus the United States and George versus the United
States, are applicable because if they had no constitutional
authority to require the information, that’s stronger than if
they had no statutory authority to require it.
25

At one time they

1

had purported statutory authority to require it but this could

2

have said the Constitution overrode and took away that juris­

o

diction from them»

4

under circumstances where* like in the Christoffel case where

5

there was not a quorum at the time the man gave false testimony

6

before a constitutional -** Congressional Committee and there

7

was not a quorum existing at that time.

8

ments made there cannot be the basis of perjury and we submit

9

that where there is a situation here where the Constitution

And it’s settled law by this Court that

They said false state­

10

forbade the Internal Revenue Service to get this information,

11

that they had .no authority to get it, just like in Christoffel

12

the Congressional Committee at fhwit particular time there was

of perjury or false statements.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. HAMBURG;

1*11 be very brief* Your Honor, because

23

most of the matters which have been raised here were replied to

24

in our reply brief, particularly the question of the constitu­

25

tional nature of wage earning tax laws, as the Marchetti and
26

1

Grosso decisions themselves expressly state, the wagering tax

2

laws have not been held to be unconstitutional and therefore

3

there is still authority in the Government to require individuals

4

to submit wagering tax returns.

against seif-incrimination.

9

Counsel has mentioned something about the differentia­

Vi

dant not receiving any benefits on the wagering tax scheme»

12

submit that first of all, receipt of benefits is not an element

13

for the False Statement Actj it hasn’t been since 1934 when the

14

present wording was adopted and secondly, that we see some bene-

15

fit to be derived by understating the number of employees one

has in any event.

We

And finally, we submit, too, that requiring returns
is a definite function of the Internal Revenue Service,
number of returns are required.

A

This one is required by a par­

ticular statute which gives the Internal REvenue Service juris­
diction to require this particular return and once again,
whether or not this is so, the statute now before the Coux't is
the False Statement Statute, and whether this individual should
be prosecuted under the False Statement Statute.
