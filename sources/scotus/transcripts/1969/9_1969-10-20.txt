MR. COLEMANs
the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The issues before the Court today involve whether

11

or not injuries which have occurred to longshoremen on piers

12

are within the coverage of the Longshoremen9 s Act.

13

This Court, will also he called upon to consider the

14

Admiralty Extension Act because tlje Court of .Appeals for the

15

Fourth Circuit answered in the affirmative the question of

16

whether Pier injuries were covered by the Longshoremen’s Act

17

and further stated that the Admiralty Extension Act extended.

18

•the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act.

13
20

The facts in this case, I think, Your Honors, are not j
disputed? they are consolidated cases and the cases before this!

21

Court involve three longshoremen.

22

four longshoremen were involved, but the fourth one, a man

23

named Van had sustained his injury, which resulted in his death

24

on navigable waters and the Deputy Commission had awarded

25

Initially, I might say, that

compensation in that ease under the Longshoremen’s Act.

3

It

1

was affirmed by the District Court and further affirmed for the

2

Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit»

before the Court today.

So, that's not

In the cases here, two longshoremen were working in

Maryland: William Johnson and Joseph Klosek were employees of

The accident which befell those men was the result of

13

the draft swinging and it knocked Mr. Klosek from the gondola

14

car to the pier.

16

gondola car and he there sustained his injuries.

He sustained injuries which resulted in his

The logs swung against him and

22

Now, in each case, in Maryland and in Virginia, th®

23

cases were presented to the respective Deputy Commissioners;

24

the Deputy Commissioners in each instance denied coverage under

25

•the Longshoremen's Act and maintained that th© accidents, had

4

1

not occurred on the navigable waters of theUnifed States.

2

Thereafter the cases were appealed to the District Court for,

3

the District of Maryland and to the District Court for the

4

Eastern District of Virginia.

And in those two courts the
!

S
6

decisions of the Deputy Commissioners were upheld.
1 might, point out that as part of the facts and which ]

I

7

'the Court will certainly wish to consider is that these piers

were very long piersj they were on pilings? they did extend

Q

over navigable waters of the United States.

10

11

The r« n who

worked on these piers could and did pass freely between the
ship and the pier.

1 recall that in the initial argument I had been

asked whether or not an appeal from the Deputy Commissioner

4

came up in Admiralty or on the civil side and 1 replied that

3

it arose on the Admiralty side of the docket.

What it said repeatedly, over and over again was that

workmen were injured on navigable waters.

He said it over and

over again and the Court held that since the injuries to the man
in the Callbeck case did occur upon navigable waters, they had
the right to recover under the Longshoremen9a Act.
Wow, the Court in that case repeated and reaffirmed
its adherence to the Jensen line of demarcation.

allegation is that the crane which was on the ship was defec­
tive in some way and so there5 s a suit pending by virtue of the;
Admiralty Extension Act against the vessel owner.

And that’s

how the Admiralty Extension Act comes into play in this type
of action.

It doesn’t have anything to do with Longshoremen’s

Act coverage.
Now, I think what the lower court failed to take
into account was the very language of thgj Admiralty Extension
' I
Act.
In the second paragraph of the Admiralty Extension Act
refers to bringing a suit in ram or in personnam.
what happens under the Longshoremen’s Act.
Act is an administrative claim.

That’s not

The Longshoremen’s

You don’t bring claim; you

don’t bring suit in rem under the Longshoremen’s Act.

You can j

do that for damages by virtue of the expansion of Admiralty
tort jurisdiction.
It’s an administrative proceeding under the

14

1

Longshoremen's Act which .involves no suit at all? it's an

2

administrative claim»

3

A claim is filed, rather than suit, so 1 think the lower court

4

simply did not take into account the legislative history, the

5

reasons, the purposes c£ the Act or anything else, and misread

©

the clear language.

It’s brought only for compensation»

\

7

That Act was' passed entirely — in 1948 it was passed

8

in order to rectify certain inequities which existed when

9

people or persons or things that were damaged on land by ships

19

on navigable waters were, until the passage of this act, denied

If

the right to an Admiralty proceeding.

12

That leads Your Honors into brief consideration of

13

this Court's decision in Rodriguez against Aetna Casualty

14

and Surety Company.

15

Court after the argument in this ease in March.

IS

Rodriguez case may have been argued before the Marsh argument*

17

It did not specifically involve the Longshoremen’s Act, but fchs

18

Rodriguez case did involve the death on the High Seas Act in

13

which the Court held that Congress had adopted State Law

20

rather than Federal Law for civil actions involving wrongful

21

deaths of workers employed on artificial island drilling rigs®

*iO

That case was decided by ths unanimous
And 1 believe

Mow, since the author of the decision, Mr. Justice
White„ did refer in his opinion to Admiralty jurisdiction and
accidents on piers located above navigable waters, it seems
important to examine that language in the light of this case*

15

1

And 1 think that it's perfectly clear from all the existing

2

laws to date that there is certainly no Longshoremen8s Act

3

coverage for land injuries.
1 believe. Your Honors, it's also clear that the

4

6

Longshoremen5s Act extends only to accidents which occur on
navigable waters and there can be Admiralty jurisdiction, of

7

course, where is Longshoremen6s Act coverage.

8

Admiralty jurisdiction. s mssa/

Act coverage in everyplace that there’s Admiralty jurisdiction,

5

But there is not

10

Because we have already seen that the Admiralty Extension Act

11

gives Admiralty jurisdiction in cases like the Gittierres case

12

v?hare a ship

13
18

opinion in Rodrigues just very recently was; "The accidents
had no more connection with the ordinary stuff of Admiralty
than do accidents on piers."
Mr. Justice White later on stated; "The accidents

m

2S

navigable waters causes damage ashore.

Mow, the language of this Court in its unanimous

13
14

of*

would be no more under Admiralty jurisdiction than accidents
on a wharf located above navigable waters."

If that is what

this Court thinks is a law, that is what this case is all about.
If•these accidents didn’t occur on navigable waters; if this
ease doesn’t involve Admiralty jurisdiction, then clearly the
lower court had to be wrong.

And that was the decision of

this Court in Rodrigues since the initial argument in March of
1969.

16

1

The last point that 1' would like to cover is the

2

continued stress by the Respondents below by the Longshoremen,

3

that it is so unfair to Longshoremen who happen to reside in

4

Virginia and Maryland, not to be able to received Federal

5

compensation because Federal Compensation in Maryland and
Virginia is considerably greater than the State Compensation

.P
in those two states.
Well, one; It seems to me that is clearly a legisla­
tive argument.

But it ignores what they are planning to do to

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,

2

SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS TRAYNOR AND

OOSTING

MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

Q

the Coarta since this is a reargument I have tried to think of

7

ways in which I could be of assistance to the Court and it has

8

seeped to me that I might focus primarily on two aspects of the

9

case which hav© been so well covered by Mr. Coleman.

10

The first is tq emphasise again ths fact that this

11

case involves purely a question of statutory construction.

12

is hot a question of Constitutional Law.

'13

forth at Pages 2 to 4 of the Government's brief and the

14

immediately relevant language is thafcin Section 3 of the Act

15

about three inches below the top of Page 3.

16

It

The statute is sat

"Compensation shall be payable under this chapter

17

in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if
ij

18

the disability or death results from an injury"”- and here is

19

the crucial word — "occurring upon the navigable waters of

20

the United States {including any dry dock) and if recovery

21

for the disability or death through Workman’s-Compensation

22

proceedings may not be validly provided by State Law."

23

Now, X think it is significant that that language does

24

not say "within the Maritime or Admiralty jurisdiction of the.

25

United States," nor does it say "as far as Congress may validly!

1 .18

1

make Federal Law apply.

2

was forded so that Congress was trying to restrict the scope

3

of Federal Law and was endeavoring to have State Law apply

4

whenever it could, but it knew that there were areas where

5

State Law could not apply and therefore it felt compelled to

6

enact this statute to provide a remedy for those who ware outO

7

sidf the scope of State Law; not for those who we ire inside the

8

scope of Federal Law, but for those who were outside the scope

On the contrary the way the statute

n

suggest that the crucial question is the understanding of

12

Congress in 1927 when that statute was written, and not what

3

the Constitutional Lav? was them not, what the Constitutional

4

Law would be now; but what was the common understanding and

15

apprehension of persons familiar with this problem in 1927?

’18

Now that, of course, goes back to the fact that State Workmen's

7

Compensation Laws were enacted beginning about 1912 — no,

21

the facts were that the injury occurred to a man who was

22

operating a truck on a gangway between a pier and the ship.

He

backed into the ship; his head was hit on the back by the ship

as he was moving1 his truck in and he was killed. The accident,
occurred on a gangway, but above navigable water and the actual

17

During this period Congress made two efforts to
provide compensation for longshoremen.

One was by an amendment

of the jurisdictional provision with respect to jurisdiction of j
Federal Courts and the other was by a statute, which, in effect,

'18

undertook to say that it is the will of Congress that State

19

Compensation Acts should apply to injuries to longshoremen
.

20

21

22
23

whether on land or on water.
In both situations this Court held that the acts of
Congress were unconstitutional? were beyond the power of
Congress because of the requirement the Court found that the

24

Admiralty power should be exercised on a uniform basis-

throughout the United States.

•

Now, whether that is right or not; whether that is

21

what this Court would now hold, seems to me not significant.

On Page 355 the Court said:

"Since the Seas Act does

not apply of its own course under Admiralty principles, and
since the Lands Act deliberately eschewed the application of
Admiralty principles to be of novel structure, Louisiana is
"

20
21

22
23
24
25

not ousted by the jSeas Act."
And on Page 359 the Act redresses only those deaths
stemming from wrongful actions ©r ©missions occurring on the
j

high seas and those cases involved & series of events of
'

artificial islands.

Admiralty jurisdiction has not been con-

strued to extend to accidents on piers, jettys„ bridges er even

27

1

ramps or railways running under the sea.

2

And again ©n Page 360s "If there's an island, albeit

3

an artificial one and the accidents had no more connection

4

with the ordinary stuff of Admiralty than do accidents on

5

piers.”
And finally, on Page 361j "In these circumstances the

8

not apply under conventional Admiralty principles, since these

9

were structured and careful scrutiny of the hearings shows that

structures."

And there is finally a considerable reliance on

12

the fast that the employe© on these structure are land-based,

13

and they go back and forth to their homes on land, and o£

And I would have only one final point to make, which

17

is with respect to the Calbeck case which is a rather broad

18

and sweeping opinion, but I would point out that it deals

19

entirely with the water Side of the Jensen Line of Demarcation.!
It says that on the water side the Longshoreman Act

20
21

is intended to b© provided broadly and comprehensively.

is nothing in the decision and little in the language in the

injuries and Jensen had precluded State* Compensation in this

area; Congress dealt with this area and used the full power at '

the holding on the basis of the Admiralty Extension Act. The

I suggest to the Court that simply-stated Calbeck rules

that the Fourth Circuit's Opinion en banc should be affirmed?

that there is no good reason in the legislative history or in

I suppose technically, Your Honor, "upon

Because of this requirement for

uniformity, a state, through its Workmen's Compensation, cannot invade the field of Admiralty.

So, all Jensen said is fchatj

no authority to legislate in this field even if there may
happen to be an overlapping with reference to pier injuries.
