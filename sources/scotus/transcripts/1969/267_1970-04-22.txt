ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ANTHONY JACQUES

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5

MR. JACQUES;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please "die

Court:
I am Robert Anthony Jacques, attorney for petitioner

8
9

You may proceed whenever

no. 267.

I believe a brief statement of the chronology of

10

events would be in order

before we start -the issues presented

it

to me by the Court in this case under the instructions of last

\z

June 23.

:

13

The petitioner in this case - Dennis Mullene Moon,,

14

was arrested on June 2f 1964 and was- tried on December 17, 1964,

15

convicted on January 7, 1965 for the crime of armed robber;,' in

16

the circuit court for Montgomery County, Maryland.

17

On October 23, 1965 the Court of Appeals of Maryland

!6

decided Schowgurow vs. Maryland.

19

they held that limitedly retroactive to include petitioner in

20
21
22

23
24
25

As a result of that decision,

these proceedings and said that he could avail himself of
that decision and take & new trial, if he so desired, since
his conviction had not yet been made final.
He, in effect, did take a new trial on June 6, 1966.
On June 7, 1966 he was convicted of armed robbery, assault with
intent to murder and larceny.
2

1

It is the irony of this case that the second judge

2

chose to increase the sentence for the same charge for which

3

the petitioner had been convicted in both cases, that is armed

4

robbery, and 'then impose, two suspended concurrent 10 year

5

sentences on the other charge.
I say in all frankness that had Judge Pugh run the

S
7

other sentences consecutively and left the sentence for armed

a

robbery at 12 years, I would not be standing here today; 1

8

would really have no case at all.
Be that as it may.

10

Judge Pugh did see fit to in­

11

crease the sentence on the identical charge, for which the

12

petitioner had received 12 years, to 20 years at his second

13

trialo

14

This Court, when it granted certiorari last June,

15

ordered me to argue the question of retroactivity of North

10

Carolina vs. Pearce.

17
18
19

Q

May I ask you before you go further, credit

was given by the second judge?
A

Yes.

Actually Judge Pugh gave the petitioner

20

more credit than he had received at his first trial.

21

ran the sentence back to the date of his arrest, whereas, the

22

first judge ran it back to the date of his first sentence only.

23
24
25

Judge Pugh

So, in effect. Judge Pugh gave him another 1 months credit.
Q

So there is no issue here as to that aspect of

Pearce and Simpson?

the Court, as a practical matter, that every decision of this

8

Court should be made retroactive.

9

that argument.

And I am not here to push

My argument, of course, is only that,

10

tl

May I state at the outset that 1 am not urging

under ‘the facts;

of this case and the criteria which this Court has outlined —

I

■

12

particularly in Stovall vs. Denno, Desist vs. United States ~~

13

that the three criteria of the purpose of the new rule,

14

reliance on the old rule and the burden on the administration

15

of justice fully justify a completely retroactive effect to

16

this case before the Court today, that is Moon.

.

'

.

"

I would like to say further, Your Honor, that I do

17
18

.

not believe that there is, in effect, a new rule.

So that the

19

question of retroactivity, I believe, is, at least, that this

20

is not a

21

22

impression to this Court.

23

effect; that it is not any change in the law of -the United

24

States.

25

retroactive case, in effect.

I would say to the

And I intend to argue later to that

It is certainly, in petitioner's opinion, not a change

in the law as expounded in United States vs. Ball or Stroud vs.

4

j

1

2

United States but was a new case.
1 would also state that, under the facts of this case

3

the three criteria stated — for instance, the purpose of the

4

new rule in this case, as I understand it, is to allow a

S

free and uninhibited right to appellate review in the state

s

and federal courts of the United States.

7

Certainly, this purpose — and the Court has so

8

stated in Stovall, I believe -- that this purpose is controll­

9

ing unless the questions of reliance or burden are such as to

10

overcome it<

11

not of such a factor.

12

I submit to the Court that those factors are

I would say this, as to reliance, that the Court in

13

.Benton, for instance, talked about collateral estoppel.

1

14

would say, first, the state had no old rule to rely on.

1 will

15

approach that later.

10

if they did rely on the Maryland law — and, of course, they

17

would argue that — there was no controlling United States

18

case for them to rely on.

19

doctrine of estoppel, they did not change their position to

20

their detriment because of this decision.

21

Since they had no rule to rely on, even

Assuming that there were, under the

If the Court will note at page 38 of the state5s

22

brief, they concede that of the 85 persons who were retried —

23

that is reconvicted under Schowgurow — 11 of them received

24

increased sentences.

25

Projecting, as a practical matter,

Maryland9s population is 4 percent of the national population?

I

that would mean, approximately, 550 prisoners in the state

2

prisons in this country -would be resentenced»

3

Q

Do you think this period of time and this number
I

4

of people is sufficient to let the law of probability have any

S

meaningful exercise?

6

and a very small place,

7

A

This is just a very short period of time

Well, Mr, Chief Justice, Schowgurow was decided

8

in October, 1965.

The state's brief was submitted in, approx­

9

imately, September, 1969.

That is 4 years.

There were, I

HO

believe 221 cases; the state had some figures which they put

If

in their brief.

12

change with time, at all.

13
14
15

Q

1 don’t see, frankly, where the figures will

Well, not the figures, perhaps, in Maryland.

I

am talking about your projecting this to the 49 other states.
A

Oh, well, very frankly. Your Honor, 1 will concede:

16

that I borrowed a copy of the brief in North Carolina vs.

17

Pearce, and petitioner for respondent there stated that perhaps

18

up to 70 percent of some cases in North Carolina had received

19

increased sentences.

20

subject to challenge.

21

22
23
24
25

So, perhaps, my figures are at least

But, I submit, that the number of cases involved
in the state courts cannot be that great — and particularly
the burden on any one state — as to justify a reliance on a
rule which, in my opinion, Your Honor, does not exist in the
first place.
6

1

Q

Well, the reliance, I suppose, was that until

2

Pearce and Simpson any Estate felt free on a retrial, any trial

3

judge on a retrial of somebody who had been previously convic­

4

ted, felt entirely free, because that was -the rule? there was

5

an absence of any other rule.

6

A

No, Your Honor

7

Q

He felt entirely free to sentence the person

8

before him who had been convicted just as though this were a

9

new case.
A

10

Please the Court? I think it goes futher than

11

that.

12

court in ray case, relied very heavily on Stroud vs. United

13

States as authority for the proposition that this Court has

14

ruled that there is no constitutional prohibition against

13

increase of sentence at the trial.
I do not so read Stroud? nor do I read the United

IS
17

I know in Maryland courts, and I believe the Maryland

States vs. Ball.

18

Q

How do you read Pearce and Simpson?

19

A

I read Pearce and Simpson to have approached the

20

prohibition against increase of sentence, with the exception

21

which the Court outlined as to conduct subsequent to the first

22
23
24
2.5

trial.
Q

Pearce and Simpson said there is no absolute

and constitutional prohibition against a longer sentence at a
new trial, didn't it?

7

A

1

That is correct? they said ---- Well, as 1

2

recall, there was no flat, absolute prohibition; I agree with

3

it. to that extent.

4

my writ of certiorari —■ that is point 3 of this argument — is

5

that that prohibition be made, in fact, a flat prohibition»
Q

6

7

io

Well then, you are saying that Pearce and

Simpson were wrong and the dissenters, in that case, were rightoj
A

Q

9

But the point that I originally urged in

Well, 1 hate to say it, Your Honor; 1 am saying

that the Court did not go far enough in Worth Carolina vs.
Pearce, yes.

i

11

Perhaps, as to this question of reliances

12

that the Court stated at some length in Pearce that they did

13

not wish to overrule the long line of cases in Ball and

U

Stroud.

15

not believe that they stand for the proposition which the Court j

16'
17

As I read the cases cited by the Court there, I do

feels it does, at least the plurality opinion in Pearce says
that it does.
1 have read the briefs in the Stroud Case, and

18
10

I know

counsel was arguing there — as it is in my brief — that,

20

since Stroud had been put in jeopardy at a former trial, he

£1

could not even be retried again for the same offense, that is,

22

murder.

23
24
25

And I say, with respect, to the Court that that is

exactly what the Stroud case stands for.

I believe Murphy vs.

Massachusetts, Ball vs. United States all stand for roughly
that proposition; that is that the fact of an acquittal or the

8

1

fast of a reversal does not, in any way, prohibit retrial for

2

the same offense.

3

I am certainly not saying that to this Court.

That

4

is an untenable argument.

S

until Pearce, had never decided the question of increase in

6

sentence at retrial.

What I am saying is that the Court,

7

As to the question of ——

X thought it was in Stroud that the man was

sentenced to life imprisonment the first trial and a death
sentence the second.
A

ii

Stroud was the ---

That is right, Your Honor.

And, of course,

12

his case came back here ironically in 1960, some 40 years later.

13

As I recall, in May of 1960 he received the death sentence.

14

then appealed and got life the second time.

15

theory of pushing his luck

And then, on the

I suppose, got a third trial and

It was at that case that his counsel urged that,since

17
18

he had already been put in jeopardy for his life, he couldn3t

19

be tried again, the third time, at all.

20

I am convinced that -that is what this Court was deciding in

21

Stroud; that there was no reason not to retry him the third

22

time.

23
24

23

He

I have read Stroud, and

If I may proceed then as to the question of the
double jeopardy argument.

As to double jeopardy, I know that

■this Court has, in Pearce, decided that the double jeopardy
9

1

argument is not applicable.

2

close reading of the language of the Fifth Amendment and of

3

the studies since then — and, in fact, the first draft of

4

James Madison*s article for the Fifth Amendment, in which Mr,

5

Madison stated that there should be no more than one punish­

6

ment nor one trial for the same offense.

7

I understand it from the art!cal- there was so much confusion

8

as to whether punishment means he couldn't be retried

9

the Stroud question — -that Mr, Madison was forced to chance

10

ii

May I say, respectfully, that a

Unfortunately, as

exactly

his original language,
1 think, very frankly, Your Honor, that the language —

12

the cases which I feel are applicable to this case are not Ball

13

and not. Stroud but ex parte Lange in 18 Wallace and United

14

States vs. Bents;.

15

reality of trial is not the trial itself, but the punishment.

16

And I might say to the Court — I have only been in

This Court said, in ex parte Lange, that the

18

the overwhelming desire and concern of the prisoner was not

19

the punishment involved.

■

20

I know that there may be some cases where, because of

21

security clearance or professional reputation, the man would

22

do anything to avoid a conviction.

23

I submit —• at least in my experience — 90 percent of the

24

appeals that go to the state and federal appellate courts in

25

this country are in some way related to the issue of punishment.

I

But, as a practical matter,

10
'
i.

1

I think that is the ultimate reality of criminal law.

2

I think, very frankly, to separate double jeopardy

3

from trial, from double jeopardy as far as it concerns -the

4

sentence, is to incorrectly judge, in my opinion, the clear

S

language of the Fifth Amendment.

6

shall not twice be put in jeopardy,'5 not by conviction, but

7

of "life and limb?" that is:

Because it says, "and

I

punishment.

I submit, Your Honor — the state has raised several

8

j

©

questions ©bouts Well, if you extended it to a flat prohibition,

10

what would happen?

You would have everybody appealing.

1

11

have statistics., Your Honor, that show that in some circuits

12

the rate of appeal is approaching 90 percent now.
Under tine uniform code of military justice for a

1.3

U

crime involving more than one year imprisonment, you have 2

15

automatic reviews; automatic, you don't even have to request

16

them.
I submit further -chat the state has, apparently, been

17
18

saying all along -chat the second trial judge sits de novo, and,

19

accordingly, he has -the right to substitute his judgment for

ZO

that of the first judge, because the first judgment has ceased

21

to exist.
If I recall the language of the Court in Pearce is

22
23
24
25

that the first sentence, insofar it is not conserved, becomes
a nullity.

2 submit, with all due respect, that this nullity

argument simply is not, cannot be distinguished from -the

11

?

argument in Pearce at all.

2

rest of the argument in Pearce.

3

It is not consistent with the

1 citede for instance, in my brief — and I would

4

very much like -'she State of Maryland to answer this question —

5

Reeves vs. State, 3 Md. App. 1915, where 'the defendant had

8

served some 6 years of a sentence of 20 years, if I recall..

7

He then got a new trial and got 20 years imprisonment.

a

The court said, "Well, we agree that this is a de
,

9

novo proceeding? we agree that tee slate has been wiped clean?

10

we agree teat the former sentence is a nullity.51

But you

11

still cansfc sentence a man 26 years on a 20 year maximum

12

charge.
As I said to the Court of Appeals, when 1 argued

13
14

this, I said, "I would like the court to explain the distinc­

15

tion between its rationale in Moon and its rationale in

16

Reeves." If the former sentence is a nullity, and it ceases

17

to exist, and the man gets another maximum sentence, it is

18

perfectly proper.

19

Reeves decision.

Now this is the logical extension of the

The Court of Appeals of Maryland declined to hear

20
21

that case.

The state asked for certiorari, and they simply

22

did not take the case.

23

one of the judges on tee Court of Appeals said he saw nothing

24

wrong with that argument.

25

got another 20 years and wound up serving 26 years on a 20

I will say, when I was arguing tee case,

The man got a de novo trial and

12

1

year charge? that was perfectly all right* because the former

2

sentence was a nullity.
I submit with respect to the Court that you cannot

3
4

consider a sentence as a nullity.

5

why most appeals are taken.

6

It is there? and it is

.How the courts in the State of Maryland have said

7

that — and they have cited from other cases -- that? on appeal?

8

idle Court of Appeals will reverse a sentence if it is excessive

0

and they feel that it violates liberty and due process.
Your Honor? my set of the Maryland reports go back to

10
11

1682? and they have recently stated that there is no case on

12

record In which -the Court of Appeals of Maryland has ever

13

reduced a sentence.

14

best of anyone9s knowledge in the entire? almost 300 years

15

the appellate procedure in Maryland? not a single ce.se has

16

ever been reversed because the appellate court felt that

17

trial judge had been too harsh.

In fact? I submit to the Court? to the
of

the

In fact? in the last few years the Maryland legisla­

18
19

ture has seen fit to establish a new procedure for- appellate

20

review of sentence under rule 762 of the Maryland Rules of

21

Procedure.

22
23
24
25

This involves a three-man bench? of which the

sentencing judge is one? and he may then — they may then either
increase the sentence? leave it alone or decrease it.
It seems to me -that this is the ultimate issue.

The

State of Maryland has now recognized that there is a division
13

I

between the appeal of the ferial and the appeal of the sentence.

2

I am asking this Court to recognise that distinction in Pearce.

3

I sim asking this Court to accept what 1 believe was

4

•the logical extension of Green vs. United States and -the

5

very fine article by Professor Van Alsfeyne about 'tills problem?

6

which I have cited in my brief.

7

And in Green — If the Court will accept the idea

8

of implicit acquittal insofar as the trial goes? then I see

9

nothing wrong — and? in fact? I think it is perfectly logical

10

to say that these has been an implicit acquittal insofar as

11

any higher sentence goes.
In other words? that court has established the

12
13

maximum sentence, and, upon retrial while there may be another

14

sentence, obviously, it cannot exceed that valid sentence.
I am asking the Court, in other words, to face what

15
16

I consider is the reality of appeals:

17

is somehow an appeal ©f the sentence and that, because our

18

courts do not recognise that on appeal, somehow error has to

!9

be found.

20

That almost every appeal

I would venture to this Court that, if you promised

21

every prisoner in any jail in the United States, that he would

22

be released if he dropped his appeal, X would venture that 90

23

percent of 'them would drop the appeal immediately.

24
25

I would venture further that, if you released him and
said that you can go ahead with your appeal, it doesn't matter,

14

i

they still would drop their appeal.

2

and I know this Court is facing other cases; we just heard one

3

about — I think that the sentencing area is the most sensitive ;

Because we are faced here -

1 think the courts — particularly this Court in

7
8

Pearce

have finally faced this entire area of sentencing

9

and punishment, and that is the ultimate reality of the law

10

of -this case and the law of every case.

There is no

good

11

reason not to apply North Carolina vs. Pearce retroactively.

HR. JACQUES:

10

II

You hate about ten minutes.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

Idle Courts
With all due deference to my brother at -the bar? I

12
13

frankly find his argument almost totally irrelevant to the

14

issues before the Court today.

15

to the issue of vindictiveness -— very frankly, I do not

16

understand that the Pearce Case is limited to where the second

17

judge is being vindictive.

18

means of taking off any chilling effect on the right of appeal.

First of ally to go immediately

1 took it to mean that this was a

I have never contended that Judge Pugh was vindictive.

19
20

I know Judge Pugh personally; I was a law clerk in that court­

21

house.

22

with all due respect to St. Thomas Acqulnas — the straw rams

23

that the vindictiveness of the second trial judge is the issue

24

before the Court.

25

The state has been consistently setting up ~ and.

It has nothing to do with this appeal.

I am saying to the Court that if Judge Pugh had the
35

1

highest motives in -the world, the ultimate fact of the matter

2

is -that Dennis Moon was sentenced to an additional 8 years

3

imprisonment.

4

0

Then yon don51 read Pearce the way

5

A

Absolutely not, Your Honor»

6

7

I do not read it

to be restricted to vindictive second-sentencing judges.
Q

the trouble is, if I may say so, you would

8

like to make the majority opinion in Pearce -the position that

0

Justice Douglas and 1 took, that it was — given Benton — a

10

double jeopardy problem.

11

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

12

Q

But we didn't prevail on that.

13

A

But, Your Honor, I -chink, reading the plurality

14

opinion in Pearce, which was based on due process

55

Q

16

h

That was -the Court opinion.
—- which was based, as 1 recall, on due process,

17

i don't recall that the Court stated that it was restricted to

18

where there was factual evidence that the second trial judge

19

had been vindictive and malicious in his sentence.

20

3: think that the state is frying, very cleverly, to

21

restrict this argument to that issue, which is, 1 submit,

22

totally irrelevant to these proceedings.

23

is whether Dennis Moon received additional time in jail.

24
25

The only issue here

Well, he did? that is not an issue; that is a

fact®

He did

A

3

punishment,

4

of Pearce?

He did®

Then the issue, Your Honor., is that

Is that increased punishment within the meaning
2 submit to you that it is an increased punishment,

5

and

6

It is simply a differing judicial philosophy between two

7

judges.

a
9

submit that vindictiveness, malice are 'totally irrelevant,

That is all that this ease is based upon.
And I submit, to quote President Truman, that the;

other charges are red herrings to be brought up here.

10

have nothing to do with the armed robbery charge.

11

the only charge upon which the appeal was based,

12

1

They

That is

I believe there was a question as to why the other

3

charges were not appealed.

Very candidly, Your Honor, I think

4

I am a rather pragmatic lawyer,

5

or suspended sentences, I am not about to appeal.

I

Where a man is given concurrent
And

with­

'6

out the authority of North Carolina vs. Pearce, I wouldn’t

17

dared to have entered an appeal in this case, so I chose not to, ;

8

Q

Sir. Jacques,

IS

h

Yes, Your Honor,

20

Q

2 would assume that you have had experience

21

where one judge is noted for giving out stiff sentences —

22

A

23

Q

— and another one is not.

24

A

That is correct.

25

Q

find if you go before a stiff man, aren’t you

Absolutely,
■

37

1

losing some of your rights or something?

2

A

Is Your Honor talking —

3

Q

You don't have a right to go before a lenient

A

Oh no.

4

judge»

5
6

I

have never raised that.
Q

7

a

1 am not saying that* Your Honor.

Or you don't have a right not to go before a

heavy-handed judge.

©

A

No, I am not saying that either.

io

Q

Well? if this man had gone before a judge that

ii

had heard the same testimony and had cut his sentence, -that

12

would have been fine?

?3

A

Obviously.

1 mean certainly.

But if Your

14

Honor is asking roe that, if the first judge had given Moon

15

20 years, whether -that would have been improper, 1 will tell

16

this Court quite frankly — if we are getting into an area of

17
18

13

20
21

22
23
24
25

judgment — there was nothing improper about giving Moon 2C-1
years.

In all candor *•— well, perhaps I shouldn't say it —

let's just say that I have never argued that the sentence, it­
self, is harsh.
That is, I submit, totally irrelevant.
judge passed a valid sentence;»

The first

The second judge passed a

valid sentence.
Now the fact of his increased knowledge and all of
this is, again, completely outside of the record of this case.
33

1

Certainly this Court knows better than I what it meant when

2

it talks about conduct subsequent to the first trial®

2

all due respect to ary brother, there is no conduct subsequent

4

to the first ferial in this case, except a second trial®

5

Certainly I would hope that the state is not going -to argue

6

that because he plead guilty at the first trial and didn't

7

plead

8

which the second trial judge can take judicial notice®

10

guilty at the second trial, -that that is conduct for

Q

9

With

Wow wait a minute, Counsel, you have lost me®

He didn't plead guilty at the first trial®
A

11

No®

The question was raised, if it would

12

please the Court, -that he admitted his guilt, at the end of

IB

his first trial but denied his guilt at his second trial.
Q

U

But he did more than that.

His testimony under

15

oath was very different in the first -trial and the second

16

trial.

It wasn't in the sentencing process alone.

17

A

18

Q

X have just read the record out of -the appendix®

19

A

At the first trial he said he did it.

20

AS I recall, Your Honor —-

At the

second trial he denied he did it.

21

Q

Well, that is quite a difference, isn't it?

22

A

That is quite a difference, but, with all due

23

respect, I don't think the Court can say that that is conduct

24

subsequent to his first conviction which would justify an

25

increased sentence.

That is part of his trial.
39

1

Q

Soma judges would -chink so.

2

A

'I interpret it very strictly, Your Honor, that

3

r conduct Beans events * which the Court has talked about, perhaps

4

his being a disorderly prisoner, perhaps creating further crimes

X

Q

You mean like lying.

6

A

Ho, Your Honor, I don81 think that is conduct.

?

Conduct to me means further trouble, very candidly.

a

there is going to be futher trouble, I think that should be

9

the subject for further proceedings.

10

And if

I think conduct means — as this Court, as I think,

11

leant in the 3 opinions in Pearce — and I know Mr. Justice

12

Shite -that you interpreted conduct to mean any events which

IS

tie second trial judge knew which the first trial judge did

14

mt -- but I 'tliink ---

15

Q

1 d:idn31 prevail on that.

16

A

That is correct.

But I think Your Honor was

17

acknowledging that the majority in the Court opinion restricted

18

conduct to the facts -that occurred after -the first conviction.
Q

19

But that doesn't carry you so far as you attemp­

20

ted to go a momemt ago.

21

perjury in your second trial is not an event.
A

22

23

Well, please the Court, 1 would have very

strong doubts about holding that to be perjury *•—
G

24
25

That is fco say that your committing

I know you do, but that is idle issue in the

case.
40

!

A

But the court would have to hold that that

2

was perjury, which it seems to

3

would have to be a separate trial on that question of perjury.

4

Perjury is a felony under Maryland law.

k,

under Maryland law, that

5

Please the Court, I don’t think -the second trial

6

judge could look at the record of the first trial end say,

7

"You lied Moon,

8

it, and you are not admitting it today,

9

you are guilty of perjury and, under the authority of North

10

You admitted at the first trial that you did
I therefore hold -that

Carolina vs, Pearce, I sentence you to another 8 years in jail."

11

Frankly, Your Honor that is just

12

Q

Fas the second testimony under oath?

13

A

Your Honor, 1 don't think so.

14

Q

Usually it is not.

15

A

Now, I was not the trial counsel, but he stood

16

up, and Judge Pugh said, "Do you have anything to say?"

17

he said, "1 didn't do it."

18

reluctant to ever prosecute a case of perjury based on those

19

circumstances.

2©

And

And I am very frankly most

I might say. Your Honor, also that the court supplying

21

an affidavit, son® three and one-half years later, conceded

22

that Pearce did not exist is — if 1 may be facetious ~ bud

23

retroactivity as opposed to the good retroactivity I am trying

24

to urge in holding Pearce to be fully retroactive.

25

It is, in effect, a nuns pro tunc rationalisation of
41

1

the sentence.»

2

closing argument — Judge Pugh felt that, this man had committed

3

a bad crime and deserved 20 years.

4

short of it.

5

Pugh that he didn,Jt deserve every day of those 20 years.

e

is

Now if Judge Pugh had stated reasons at the

That is the long and

Midi, very frankly, I am not arguing with Judge
That,

not 'the issue before the Court today.

7

1 think that the rest of it, about other charges,

8

about there being malice is totally irrelevant to the issue

9

before the Court.

1 am sorry, 1 believe my time is up.
