ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT AMERICAN FARM LINES

MR. CALIFANO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Mr. Gerra, on behalf of the United States Government,,
We would like to reserve a

The conflict before this Court arises because of the

5

determination of the Defense Department to reduce the time

6

during whibh defense materiel is in transit, and thus achieve
substantial savings, increased efficiency and with respect to

8

S

explosives and other dangerous cargo, increased safety.
Until 1966, virtually all defense motor carrier

1©

shipments were an a joint-line basis by regulated carriers,

11

with routing specified in detail in their certificates of

12

operating authority.

13

They required several carriers to transport the same load of

14

defense materiel.

15

The routings were generally secured.

In 1966 the Department began to use exempt farm

16

cooperatives, including American Farm Lines to provide a fast,

I?

direct, point-to-point service.

m

cooperatives because a legislative exemption freed them from

19

a certificate restriction of regulated carriers, thus enabling

20

them to provide the direct single-line service.

21

The Department used farm

Under thisexemption American Farm Lines has had

22

substantial amounts of defense materiel.

23

promptly demonstrated hthree advantages to the Department of

24

direct service; the direct savings from lower direct transpor­

23

tation costs, the indirect savings from lower inventories, and

The first issue is whether the evidence adduced by the

complied with procedural rules of the I.C.C»

call upon shippers to provide eleven categories of information.

16

The court below raised no question about nine categorias of

17

the information provided by the Defense Department.

18

questioned the Department's response to two of these categories.

19

One was, and I quotes "whether efforts had been made to obtain

20

the service from existing motor rail or water carriers and the

2!

dates and results of such efforts"and the other iss "Names and

that the Defense Department did not comply literally with the

requirements of these two categories.

In the Estes ease, the Railway Express Agency applied

for temporary authority after a railroad had announced that it

that service from anyone else, because it was simply not

which among other things, specified some 65 point-to-point

routings and says that there is no known carrier who can pro­

I think in this connection it's important to realise

that the Defense Department is probably the most experienced

shipper in the Western World, moving 64 billion pounds of

freight, every year.

these carriers have no authority to provide direct single-

Mr, Chief Justice, economically and in direct savings costs if
comparable reductions result, as the record, indicates,

10 percent.

There would be savings in the indirect

cost, because you would have to carry less inventory in your

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, for the ordinary

shipper the question — the X.C.C. does not grant new

authority just because there is a preference for it.

15

cepfc is whether or not there is an immediate and urgent need

and whether other carriers can provide the same service.

The idea of having to make efforts, I think, was to

like this.

order.
Now, the pertinent facts concerning this question are
not in dispute, but I think they are important and we ought to
highlight them to bring focus on the issue.
After the Commission issued its first order, many
protesting carriers filed petitions for reconsideration and
some sought that the Commission stay the effect ©f this grant

And they granted the temporary authority for the

The protesting carriers immediately filed a complaint
in court, a supplemental complaint, attacking the second grant
and they obtained from the same District Judge, a temporary
restraining order against that grant's operation*
On final review after briefs and oral argument, the
three--judge court held that without prior leave of court, the
Interstate Commerce Commission lacked jurisdiction to reopen
this administrative proceedings after the court had assumed
jurisdiction and issued the first temporary restraining relief*
In this connection the court also held that there was
nothing validly pending before the Commission. They said that
the Commission — the protesting carriers petitioned for

Rule 6 or by General Rule of Practice 101(a)(2).

With this holding the court concluded that there was

Taking these holdings in reverse order, we submit

first that the court simply misconstrued the Commission's

It would seem to us that the court’s construction of.

judicial review had been commenced, the I.C.C. lacked juris­
diction to reopen' ‘for hearing additional evidence.

decision below, the Government didnot concede that the Com­

Simply because a court may have

the jurisdiction to complete the administrative process.

In

such circumstances, we would submit, the proper procedure is
for the reviewing court to hold the judicial action in abey­
ance pending completion of the administrativeprocess.
The Commission has had experience over the past 18

A

That is not correct, Your Honor.

They wanted

a single-line service for the various savings that could be
experienced in both time-wise and money-wise.

Now, they have talked ~ Appellees have talked about
the point of perhaps this would not be an impartial quasijudicial body in rendering a decision, but rather that the

25

The Commission’s primary and never-ending rule is to administer
transportation policy.

Even if a reviewing court had remanded

to the Commission an order which it put out, it still would be
responsible, as this Court has said on many occasions to
administering the transportation policy by either reopening the
matter to reconsider it on the existing record, reopening to
receive new evidence, or

otherwise disposing of it.

The Court has clearly spelled that out in the Idaho
Power case in 344 U.S.
There is another reason, though, we think that this
procedure should be sustained here.

In ax^oiding delays in­

herent in court reversals and remands, the Commission’s action
is consistent with the broad purpose of the temporary authority
proxrisions of the Act themselves.

30

That is, the question of

t

immediacy.

in such manner as best will be conducive to the ends of

order, the Commission was free to do so,

in both the best interests of judicial economy and agency
responsibility.

reflecting the Commission's regulations and then move on to a

25
31

in which these issues arise»

2

This has nothing to do, I may note, with the tension

between the exempt provisions of the Act, relating to co­

4

operatives and the other provisions of the Act, because, as

5

Mr. Califano has noted; the Congress settled that problem with

the enactment of legislation in 1968; so that no question

12
13

dustry of interstate transportation since the time the Congress!

program, for a variety of reasons having to do with the5, protec­

key industry that does have common carrier obligations, has
decided that, the public . interest would be best served, by and

as I believe Mr. Califano indicated, a grant of temporary

21

Q

Well, you prevailed below.

A

Yes, Your Honor, but —

Q

Is there a stay?

A

There is a stay; there is a stay.

Now, the Temporary Authority Statute which was enacted

16

17

So, that we face a

in 1938 at the behest of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
shortly after passage of the 1935 Motor Carrier Act, of course,
cuts sharply across the grain of this general statutory
scheme, because it permits the Commission without hearings, at
its discretion, to permit this kind of authority to be exer­
cised.

22
23
24
25

What the Commission said to the Congress, quite
sensibly, it seems to me, was that there might vary well be
occasions in which a shipper5s need was so imperative, so
34

1

immediate that its satisfaction should not await the con­

a

clusions that have often prolonged permanent application pro-

3

ceedings»

4

Now* what the Congress had in mind when it enacted

5

the statute was that it would be limited to emergencies„

6

is what the Senate Report said* since temporary grants would

7

be limited to situations in which there wasan emergency»

This

And

8

that* accorded with the kinds of things the Commission was

9

talking about to the Congress* because it was speaking in terms

1©

of new oil wells coming in* and the havoc that's wrought by

1!

floods and what it referred to in short* as ''calamitous

n

visitations»"

13

And the Commission did represent to the Congress that

14

it recognised need —- care would have to be emphasised to

15

protect the interests of visiting carriers»

16

that the Congress chose was well-suited to limit the applica­

17

tion of this statute.

ao
21

22
23
24
25

And the language

The Congress spoke* as the Court is

aware* in terms of an immediate* urgent need for service that
no existing carrier could provide»
Now* it was that statutory framework against which
the Commission was called upon to evaluate AFL's application
for authority»

It may be that in the annals of the Commission

there are applications that have been granted that are as
sweeping in scope as this one* but if there we do not know of
them and the Commission does not refer to them»

— it isn’t in the record and Z5m not absolutely confident
about it» but my impression would be that there isn’t.
The application was supported, as the Court has been
advised, by a statement by a single branch of the Government,
the Defense Department,

In that statement the Department did

not state that in the absence of AFL service the existing

The Department said this, and I quote: "That the
Department is not in a position to state that there would be
insufficient or inadequate service without American Farm Lines,
And then shortly after the filing of its statement in another
letter that it sent to the American Trucking Associations, it
said that its support of AFL was "an expression of a desire of
the Department to have available the type and quality of ser­
vice which AFL has provided, regardless of the carriers which
might provide the same."
So that in our view it is not particularly astonishing
when the Temporary Authorities Board of the Commission denied
its application.

But, as the Court, has been advised, Division

1 of the Commission on appeal, reversed that determination and
the authority was granted; the protesting carriers went to
court and secured a temporary restraining order,

The Commis­

sion, thereupon, on its own motion reopened the record and
finally the last DOD statement, the so-called Caputo statement
was put into the record.

in this first branch of the case, and that is whether the
*
Caputo statement measured up to the requirements of the regula»
tions, so I turn now to the regulations, which are set forth
in, I think it is Appendix B t© the brief of Certain Motor
Carrier Appellees, beginning on Page 32 of that brief.
Now, what the regulations say at the outset is that
they are designed to implement the Temporary Authority Statute.
And I think the first thing, perhaps to note is that they di­
vide temporary authority into two categories: one is called
"emergency temporary authority," and the other for want of a
better word. I’ll call it "ordinary temporary authority.’5
Emergency temporary authority,- according to the regula­
tions is to be granted only where there isn’t enough time to
38

provide notice to interested parties, and then itEs restricted,

2

It's restricted to 30 days and then it can be continued only

3

until ordinary temporary authority can be either granted or

4

denied-

S

Now, this case, of course, is one of ordinary tem­

6

porary authority and the regulations that begin on page 37, I

7

think clearly make this an adversary proceeding before the

8

Commission, because they require the basic elements of an

9

adversary proceeding-

They require that notice be given to

10

The timetable is

Now, what the protestants are able to put in their
rebuttals, of course, depends in large measure on what the
applicant is required to put in his application, and associated
papers, and that brings me to the regulation that is most
directly involved, and that begins on page.34, subparagraph c,

That regulation refers to the suppor-'
"Each applica­

and urgent need for service which cannot be met by existing

And then it goes on to say that "Any such supporting

statement must contain at least the following information;"

9

and it sets forth 11 categories as Mr» Califano has indicated.;

And the basic question is whether the Caputo state­
ment complied with the requirements of 7 and 8 and if it
didn't, what the consequences ought to be.
Seven and eight go to what a shipper is supposed to
say as to whether or not he has made any effort to get this
service from existing carriers.

If he has made those efforts,

he is then supposed to give the names and dates of the allegedl Y
defaulting carriers and the reasons that they assigned for not
being able to perform, and that sort of thing.
Now, analysis at this point is impaired somewhat by
the fact that we believe that the Appellants have taken rather
markedly divergent views of what the Department of Defense
said in response to the threshold question of subparagraph 8.
Now, that uquestion is; whether any efforts have been made to

40

1

obtain the service from existing carriers»
American Farm Lines says clearly in its brief and I

make any such efforts.

Adams and Chenery case(?)

of the Commission has to be defended upon the grounds that
it put it on and that therefore, that this argument that AFL
advances here, newly-devised, advanced here, I think, for the
first time in this litigation, is simply not open.
I would like to say that there are additional infirmi­
ties' in it, and Isd like to touch on those for a moment.
Because, of course, normally if a shipper says that he hasn't
made any efforts to get the service thathe wants from existing
carriers, that would be fatal; not because of noncompliance of
the regulations, but because of noncompliance with the statute.
He simply would not have made a sufficient showing.
43

1

Now, AFL says that that shouldn't he the case here,

2

because, as Mr. Califano said, what DOD wanted was single-line,

3

direct service and knew that wasn't available from existing

4

carriers between many of thepoints, and therefore it would

5

have been bootless for them to ask for it.

6

single-line direct route service is obviously superior to

7

joint-line service.

8
9

-

And they add, that

Well, I think they summarized their position quite
succinctly in their reply brief, back on page 13.

This is

10

what AFL sayss""The Department made clear that it's support fox

11

AFL was premised, not on service failures, but upon the

12

Department's desire to upgrade the* quality and reduce the cost

13

of" the motor transportation service available to it through the

14

certification of direct, single-line service.

15
16

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now, had that been the argument made by DOD ex­
plicitly to the Commission, we suggest that the Commission
surely should have concluded, at least, that for the reasons
I have already indicated.

The Temporary Authority Statute was

simply not designed to permit the short-circuiting of all of
the" other procedures of the Act, simply in order to upgrade
the quality and reduce the cost, of the service available.
Q

Was that because it's not urgent, or what?

A

That's because it's not urgent and immediates

that is correct, Mr. «Justice.

this question of

20

what it is that we complain about in terms of the Go'-eminent' s

argument, which I understand to be that there were defaults.

22

The Solicitor General says the Caputo statement did not give

23

names, dates, particulars about the service deficiencies about

24

which it was complaining.

25

and so I guess really the basic question is whether it should'

There isn't any question, I think, that he8s

right in making the concessions that he does.

whether or not this is — if I may,

for lack of a better —

7

word, say prejudicial error ought to be the traditional one.

8

Xtf ought t© be whether had the error not been committed might

9

the outcome have been changed.
The Government says that it would not have been.

10

11

They say in their brief that the provision of these details

12

could not have affected the outcome and I understand them to

13

say that on the notion that the evidence of record was com­

24
25

Now,that's kind of a harmless error doctrine, it
seems to us has no place unless the evidence that's being
relied upon as compelling is independent of the error.

That

isr to say that correction of the error would not have affected
that evidence,
Now, if you've got 20 eyewitnesses to a crime and they
all identify the defendant in a trial and the trial judge
improperly circumscribes cross-examination going to the eye­
sight of one of them, well maybe that's hamless error.

But

that situation doesn’t resemble the one at bar at all, because
the provision of the details by DOD might radically have

51

1
2

have undercut the force of its submission.
How, I don't have the time and oral argument for the

3

kind of detailed textural analysis of this statement that we

4

do have in the briefs, but let me illustrate to the Court what

5

kind of thing I have in mind.

The most important parts of the statement are

generalities.

They are always qualified in what we regard as

a suggested way.

examples, other than to note-that again, that they did not

20

comply with the regulations.

21

25

The allegedly defaulting carriers

were not identified? they did not have the opportunity of
rebuttal.
But, beyond that, I suggest that the fact that BOD
did provide some examples, cuts in our favor and not against
us, because in the first place it shows they can provide
53

1

exairsples and in the second places one cannot, put aside the

z

possibility, Mr. Chief Justice, that this is about all they

3

could come up with, because as I said before, they drafted

4

this statement in the face of the temporary restraining order,

5

which pointed to noncompliance with subparagraphs S and 9 as a

6

problem.

7

at least reasonable — it is reasonably possible to assume that

8

this was about, as good as they could do.

9

possibility, then surely compliance with the regulations,

They want back and they drafted it and I think it is

But, if that’s a

10

compelling the Department to comply with the regulations might

21

entirely change the outcome of this case, because if this

handful of examples is all that the Department could come up

13

with, 1 would find it very difficult to believe that the Com­

14

mission would have granted this temporary authority.

record demonstrates.

The Department is not always infallible

1 would refer the Court to the statement of

the Munitions Carriers Conference which is here someplace.

Lot me just summarise what it says — here it is.

25

It5s on page 308 or 309.

Whafcit says, basically, is that DQD

in one of its statements gave, before this Caputo statement,
gave three examples of what it asserted were deficiencies and
two of them could be verified in terms of the carriers that
were involved and thosecarriars put in rebuttal.
54

One of them,

I

indeed, as the statement says? submitted photostatic copies of

z

documents which established that the charge was false. And

3

DOD didn't repeat any of those in the Caput© statement.

4

So that the opportunity to rebut specific data when

3

that specific data is given by DOD is important to the

6

Appellees.

8

Califano really has given me my basis for distinguishing Estes.

this record to establish that any of the protesting carriers

What are the regulations

where the cases hold where the burden lies in establishing that?
Who had the burden there?
A

Oh# well# I think clearly the Applicant has the

burden under the regulations# and particularly if they are
talking aboirt single-line service# because that requires# in
terms of the regulations# a clear showing that the existing
carriers have defaulted.

1 don’t think really that the Commis­

sion Counsel would disagree, but the burden here is on the
Applicant# especially in terms of the concern of the Congress
expressed in the Committee Reports that this temporary authority
statute be utilised only in emergencies# as it is an exception
to the general statutory scheme.

And the Commission

will, one way or another, in the many, many proceedings that

are pending before it now, seeking modification of routes and

20

this sort of thing, will have to decide how this problem can

21

be worked out so as to provide the best service to the depart­

ment without working undue damage on the existing motor and

Now? 1 would gather from Mr. Cerra"s argument that?

perhaps erroneously? hut let me just state what I seem to feel

4

about it, and that is that if these petitions for reconsidera­

5

tion had not bean pending at the time that the Commission re­

6

opened the record, there would not be a very strenuous argument

7

from the other side that the Commission was free to do what it

14

thing means , it would seem to me to lead to the conclusion

that where the Commission, in effect, wipes out the race of the

litigation, they are acting inconsistently with the court's

It

20

a new judgment which was then subject to further appeal so that

21

it seems to me that the turning question here is the effect of

22

the pending petitions for reconsideration,.

23
24
25

Now, our first position on that is that those
petitions for reconsideration could not have extended the
authority of the Commission, because they were not authorised

60

1

The regulation respecting the petitions for re COR side ration

z

in temporary authority proceedings as set forth on page 47 of

3

4

identified two kinds of orders from which such petitions can

5

be taken and this case does not involve either one of them.

6

That, 1 think, is conceded.

7
8
9

Now, it

But, what Mr. Cerra says is that the general rules of
practice of the Commission do authorise a petition for re­
consideration in these circumstances and that that rule should
be read into the temporary authority rule, because the tempor­

»1

20
21

ary authority rule starts out; “pursuant to, and in accordance
with the Commission3s general and special rules of practice.3
Now, we think that a more normal reading of that
phrase, "pursuant to and in accordance with,” would be to
refer to procedural questions, such as the number of copies'
and that sort of thing.
But, more important than that, if the general rules
and *the special rules are read into this rule, then this rule
is robbed of any independent significance, because the petitions
for reconsideration that are authorised by this rule are also

I

authorised by the general and special rules, so that to give it
any meaning, one must read it restrictively.

One must con­

clude that this rule establishes the only circumstances under
which petitions for reconsideration are to be permitted in
temporary authority proceedings.

It reopened the proceeding on its own

There is a reference in a footnote in APL's brief

to the effect that that is not so and that the Commission in™

9

dicated that it believed that the petitions were authorised,

10

but I refer the Court to the record citation.

II

by Commission counsel in the court below.
But, beyond that, we say that even if the petitions

12

13
14

15
16

17

were not authorised, that the results should be the same.

20
21
22
23
24
25

And

we say that fundamentally, because we think if the result is
different then an important policy consideration underlying the
principle restricting agency freedom in the context of judi­
cial review, should be undercut.
And thatpolicy, we think, arises from the dual role

18
19

It is to a fories

of the agency.

It is, of course, first and foremost, a neutra3

arbiter, but then when its orders are attacked it becomes a
litigant.

Now, so long as the litigation is simply conducted

by the General Counsel's office, there is no possibility of
conflict of interest, but where the Commission reopens the
review
procedures after the judicial/has commenced, and particularly
where the court has identified what it sees as a possible
62

1

difficulty in the Commission 9 a position, then we suggest that

t

there is a risk that tlm agency will act more as a litigator

3

than as an arbiter,

15

errors, and certainly that8s true; that5s an important policy
consideration.

But, first of all the rule that we're arguing

for doesn't deny the agency the right to do that; it simply
requires that the agency get the authority of the court to
do whatever it wishes to do.
And in the second place, the facts of this case, while
certainly not conclusive one way or the other, do not fit
very neatly, we suggest, into the notion that what the Commis­
sion was doing here was correcting an error and that alone,
The Government in its footnote to its brief, indicates

16
17

He says, in connection with his

point, that one must allow the Commission the right to correct

12
13

well£

that the Commission had in mind when it reopened the record,
this problem respecting subparagraphs 8 and 9 of the regula­

18

W
20

tions.

But if that is so, it didn't do anything about that

problem, at least directly.

It did not suggest to the Depart­

ment that they comply with subparagraphs 8 and 9,

It did not

21

direct the attention of the Department to subparagraphs 8 and 9
22
What it did was to reopen the record and take additional
23
evidence from the Department and then its counsel returned to
24
court below, as they d© here, and concede that there were
25
63

1

defaults with respect to the compliance with,these regulations,

2

as Judge Bolt indicated in that very first hearing, but argue

3

that, the additional evidence that was taken was so compelling

4

as to outweigh these problems with respect to the regulations.

5

As I say, I don't suggest that these facts are con­

8

clusive, with respect to this risk that 1 am talking about,

7

but they are not inconsistent, at least, with the theory that

8

I advance.

9

And, so what we argue for, and 1 may say that it

10

seems to me that whatss needed here is a rule.

be a clearcut rule.

that we are right or we are wrong.

But what 1 do say is that

we think the burden on the Commission is complying with the
rule that we are talking about would be very, very slight,
indeed, whereas the risk of danger on the other side is
reasonably significant.
And so what we urge is a rule* that would require the
Commission, when judicial review has commenced, or at least
after the court has taken a significant step in the case, and
that here was the grant ©f the temporary restraining order
after a full hearing.

But at that point the Commission then

' would be required to go to the court and seek authorisation if
it wishes to reopen the record and enter a new order.

We think

that, as 1 say, that “s a slight burden on the Conraission.
64

It

1

prevents any hazards with respect to the legitimate interests

2

of the parties before the Commission.
That, I think, summarizes our case, if it please the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOSEPH A. CALIFANO, JR., ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT AMERICAN FARM LINES

9

MR. CALIFANO:

Thank you, Mr. Dempsey.

Mr. Chief Justice., if I may just make

10

a couple of points.

II

Justice White on the granting of temporary authority where

12

single-line service is involved.

13
14
15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22

One with respect to the regulation Mr.

That, regulation does go on

to provide that a grant of temporary authority to effectuate
single-line service will be authorised only when if is clearlyestablished that the carriers providing multiple-line service
are not capable or fail to meet needs.
The same regulation, subsection 2 of it, specifically
lists as one of the occasions on which an immediate and urgent
need exists, an occasion where there is, "a discontinuance of
existing service," and I do think it’s important to note that
the Department of Defense had the service of American Farm
Lines for some two-and-a-ha1f years —
Q

On an exempt basis?

A

On an exempt basis and that service was being

23
24
discontinued.
25

65

1

Secondly, Mr» Chief Justice, with respect to the

2

burden of proof, 1 just would like to point out, quoting from

3

the regulation that's in the brief filed by Mr, Mams and the

4

American Trucking Association that with respect to the filing

3

of protests, it says? "Such protest must be specific as to the

6

service which protestant can and will offer and must consist

7

of a-signed original," et cetera, et cetera.

S
9
10

11

I think at best it's fussy as to where the burden of
proof lies when you read this regulation which follows
immediately upon a regulation listing the 11 points.
Q

Well, it says a default in the first place.

12

Failure to answer questions-like 8 and. 9, doesn't that, per­

13

haps alter the situation somewhat?

14
15

A

I think, Mr. Chief Justice

as 1 have indicated

and as many of the Appellees have conceded, if you say no

16

efforts have been made that9s an answer, too.

17

to 8 and 9.

That's an answer

If you say efforts have been made, then the

18

question is s "What kinds of efforts were made and what came

19

out of it?"

20
21

22
23
24
25

This is a procedural rule of the I.C.C. designed to
help them, I believe, and I think the problem is that we have
just a unique shipper, not like any other shipper in the
country and the question is whether or not his statement
measures up under either of those alternatives and we believe
that what he was asking for was clear here and they clearly
66

I

couldn’t provide it.

2

Finally, on the point of need, I would indicate as I

3

think Mr. Justice Brennan asked, that if in this day and age

4

there is not a need for sharply-“reducing defense costs, as

5

this would do, and for safety in moving dangerous materials,

6

it’s hard to think of what moreurgent needs we could have than

7

that.
