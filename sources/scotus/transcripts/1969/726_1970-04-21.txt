What injunction did you ask for?

22

A

In the prayer for relief we asked both for a

temporary and a permanent injunction.

Against what?

A

Against the state officials, requiring them to

When?

In the June 1968 election,

That is correct.

No, we did not.

An injunction is strong medicine, and, generally,

We sought to enjoin, both by the temporary relief

14

to stop, to enjoin the execution and enforcement of the

A

The United States is not a party.

We could not

restrain the United States from enforcing the Act as against

Following that election, we amended our

The next point is that, in support of the lower

elections.

Forty-one states have been the sites of those

1(5

elections.

And in Minnesota there have been 27 elections.

17

All but one of these have been election contests for state

The Attorney General has made the argument below that--

The Party has participated in -(die past in IS3

and this was adopted by the three-judge court — that it is

21

just speculative that the Party will run for future elections.

And he said the earliest time it could come up again is 1972.
We would like to point out to the Court that the

He did appear and argued to the court that the

that it can be interpreted, citing Catherwood, for the pro­

22

to appear on the ballot with the designation, Communist Party —

an argument that was not accepted by either the court or by

the Attorney General.

He also suggested to toe Attorney

I think that that position of the United States fails,

The United States in its brief relied on Salwen and

7

Rees — the only other case construing the Communist Control

3

Act in terms of elections — for the proposition that a

.9

Communist Party candidate could run for election.
In that case the Hew Jersey courts, including the

10

II

Supreme Court, did not accept even that argument and said that

n

it would be a keen way to avoid the effect of the Act if

13

Communist Party candidates could run and hide from the public -

14

or not mention the fact -- that they are espousing Communist

15

Party principles.
Both the appellants and the appellees in this case

16
17

agree that there is no question that the Communist Control

18

Act bars the Communist Party or its candidates from running

19

in elections, whether or not they disclose

that they are running under the Communist Party label,

Did they repudiate him?

11

A

They did not.

12

The United States, we feel, did not appear to defend

13

the constitutionality of the Act, because they had a longstand­

14

ing provision that such an act violates the Constitution of

15

the United States.

18

and the years subsequent ™— a number of bills which would have

17

barred the Communist Party from activity, two congressional

18

sub-committees were holding hearings on legislation aimed

19

at restricting the activities of the Communist Party.

In 1948 when Congress was considering —

20

One bill would have banned from the ballot, in

21

any election in the United States, all political parties

22

directly or indirectly affiliated with the Communist Party

of the United States.

After the bill's constitutionality was- assailed by
a number of witnesses, the committee recessed to await an

because no request was made that would have the effect of

that even if the plaintiffs here secured

Q

You do not claim any less authority than the

17

Attorney General has?

18

A

It is our position on this appeal that juris­

19

diction is also lacking, in addition to the fact that a three-

20

judge court, in our view, was not required below; but that

21

there was no denial of a permanent injunction in this litigation

22

and that is a requirement of Section 1253, a section which was

23

recently reviewed in .an analogous context in the Goldstein

24

decision by this Court about 2 months ago.

25

It says that this Court has appellate jurisdiction
32

1

MR. CASTNER:

Thank you, Mr. Kyle.

I would like to speak first to the

question of 1253 jurisdiction.

Appellants urge that the

10

Goldstein Case is not applicable to this case.

Goldstein said

11

that the only interlocutory orders, which the Court has power

12

to review under 1253, are orders granting or denying preliminary

We urge that once a three-judge court is

We feel this was the situation in Moore and QgiXvie.

Is Hall and Baals the Colorado case?

Yes, it is.

In that case this Court mooted
