ARGUMENT OF ALLISON W. BROWN, JR., ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6
MR. BROWNs

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts

8

This casa is before the Court for the second time,
ID

having been here previously on order of this Court granting a

!1

petition for a writ of certiorari, at the same time the Court

12

vacated the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals

13

and remanded the proceeding to the Virginia Supreme Coutt of

14

Appeals for further consideration in light of the case of Jones

15

against Alfred H. Mayer Company,

16

the Court.

That was in the 1 67 term of

17

Last year the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, after

18

receipt of this Court's mandate, refused to accept the remand and

1

to reconsider the case in light of the Mayer case, and issued an

20

opinion indicating that it would not take the case back for the

21

same reason that it had refused to entertain the appeals on the

22

first occasion, the reasons stated being petitioners * alleged

23

failure to comply with a certain procedural rule of the Virginia

24

Supreme Court of Appeals.
The Court indicated that it had not had jurisdiction

25
I
fS

3

1

over the proceeding in the first instances, and that it did,

z

therefore, not have jurisdiction to accept the remand.

3
4
5

We petitioned for certiorari, and the case is now here
again on the Court's granting of this second petition.
By granting the first petition for certiorari, the

6

Court impliedly held that the non-Federal ground upon which the

7

State Court decided' the case was inadequate to support the judg­

8

ment and that the Federal question should, therefore, be examine 1.

9

The State Court, by failing to accept the remand, by

W

failing to comply with this Court's mandate, we submit, has

II

failed to observe its responsibilities under the supremacy claus-

12

of the Constitution.

13

We ere now before the Court on the merits.

14

The principal issues in the case concern the matter of

IS

whether a community recreation association may engage in racial!;

16

discriminatory policies and practices under the prescriptions

17

contained in' the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which this Court con­

18

strued in Jones against Alfred Mayer Company; and whether, also,

19

those racially discriminatory practices are banned or prohibited

20

by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

21

The second question, major question, that is, is

22

whether a third party who is a member of this local recreation

23

association and dissents from its policies mayconsonant with

24

the protections afforded by the 18S6 law and the Constitution,

25

be expelled for his dissent.

4

1

Briefly, the facts are that Little Hunting Park, Inc,

2

is a non“Stock corporation organized under the Virginia law for

3

the purpose of providing a community recreation facility.

4

has a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a park and picnic area.

5

The by-laws provide that its facilities are available, marloar-

6

ship is available, to anyone living within a prescribed neighbor­

7

hood, a prescribed geographic area consisting of four real ©star

8

subdivisions, plus such adjacent areas or additional areas as

3

the Board of Directors might decide.

10

It

The membership in the association is obtained by the

11

purchase or assignment of shares.

Shares may be purchased for

12

a sum of money, and they may also be obtained upon assign-runt

13

from landlord to tenant.

These are provisions of the by-laws.

There is a limit of 600 shares in the association, and

14

15

the record shows that in the history of this association's

16

existence, namely, from 1965 to 1966, when the trial was held,

17

assignment and fcr&iifefer of .shares had been uniformly permit-tod

18

by the Board of Directors of the association, all such assign­

19

ment and purchase of shares being subject to approval, the only*

20

occasion for a.

21

at the time of the. incidents which are .alleged hcraMn to ?. ava

22

been the basis for this action,.namely, the refusal to per:it

23

as followss

2

the neighborhood covered by the by-laws of the association, and

3

in 1955 or 1954, when the association had been formed, had pur­

4

chased a share which he used so long as he lived in a house on

5

Quandsr Road in Fairfax County, Virginia.

Mr. Sullivan, a whits man, had owned property in

He, after 11 years, moved to another house, and as

6
7

part of the purchase price of the second house, purchased a

8

second share in the association.

9

to rent the first property, and as part of the lease, made the

10

practice of assigning the share in the association that he had

11

purchased to accompany the first piece of property, or the first

12

house.
So Mr. Sullivan owned two shares.

He owned two

Th© first house he rented out.
In 1965 he rented the first house to Dr» Freeman,

and as part of the lease provided for the assignment cf the shara
in the association that went along with that property.

18

Q

Was this the first time ha had rented that house,?

19

h

No, this was not.

He had had three prior tenants

20

and he had made a practice of assigning the association member­

21

ship share, and at least the record shows that the assignments

22

23
24
25

had always been approved by the Board of Directors.
Q

With respect to three previous tenants.

A

Yes.

What happened here was that when Mr. Sullivan submitted
6

1

the application for assignment of his share to the Board of

E

Directors, the Board of Directors of the Association, disapproved!

3

it for the reason that Dr. Freeman and his family were Negroes»
Q

4

Is there any remaining issue as to the question

5

of the motivation for disapproval?

6

that there is any reason other than the fact that the appli­

7

cant was a Negro.

A

8

Is there any claim, now,

So far as I know, there is no such claim, sir.

There was a suggestion of this raised in the opposition to the

9
10

first petition for certiorari, or maybe it was the second peti­

n

tion, and we filed a response to that pointing out the places

12

in the record showing conclusively that race was the reason for

13

the disapproval of the membership assignment and the issue has

u

not been raised now in respondent’s brief.
As a result of Mr. Sullivan’s disappointment with the

18
16

failure ©£ the association’s Board of Directors to approve the

17

assignment to Dr, Freeman, Mr. Sullivan sought to find out why

18

the assignment had not been approved, and he sought to, within

19

the association, work out means, and within the neighborhood

20

where this occurred he sought to bring about a reversal of what

21

hdi thought to be the discriminatory refusal to approve this

22

assignment.
As a result of his activities, both within the associa

23

tion and among persons in the neighborhood, such as leadesr in

24

the church and other community leaders, the association’s Board

25

7
i

1

of Directors expelled Mr, Sullivan,

The two actions her© seek (1) relief for Mr, Sullivan»

3

we seek his reinstatement in the association, and damages for

4

the injury that he has suffered, as a result of the expulsion t

5

and secondly, we seek damages for Dr, Freeman,

7

Although an injunctive remedy may be of future value to h.xm, xt

is of no immediate value because ha doesn9fc live there» and we

10

seek damages on his behalf for the discrimination that he suf­

fered .

12

Dr. Freeman is

We think there is little doubt but what the 1866 Civil

13

Rights Act which this Court construed in Jones against Mayer

14

applies to the facts of this ease.

15

contained presently in 42 U.S.C.» Sections 1981 and 1982. Sec­

16

tions 1881 grants Negroes the same rights as white persons to

17

make and enforce contracts.

18

same right as white persons to inherit, purchase and. lease

The provisions of law are

Section 1982 grants Negroes 'cno

/

19

20

real and personal property.
The record shows that both of these provisions of law

21

are relevant here.

22

and Dr. Freeman which provided for the assignment of the share

23
24

25

There was a contract between-Mr. Sullivan

involved, and the Board of Directors of the association refused
to permit the consummation or the performance of that contract
because of the race of Dr. Freeman, so that would make Section
8

1
2

1981 applicable on its face.
Section 1902,, 42 U.S.C., we believe is applicable by

3

virtue of the fact that the membership share here is personal

4

property and the membership in the association constitutes an

5

incident of the real property and, indeed, it was a part of the

6

leasehold interest that Dr. Freeman obtained fxciti Mr. Sullivan.
\

7

S

q

Mr. Brown, would this situation fall under the

Civil Rights Act of 1968?

^

9

A

Bo, 1 don’t believe so, Your Honor.

10

q

I mean apart from the effectiva date of that Act.

n

A

l am not certain of that,

12

13

I just don't know the

answer, sir.

25

not yet construed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, we pressed, in
addition, a constitutional basis for our case.

Under this

Court°s decision in Evans versus Newton, we felt that this
association performed the same function as Bakersfield Park,
which was at issue in the Evans against Newton case, namely,
that it was a public facility which provided public recreation
and that it had all of the attributes of a public facility of
the sort that were at issue in Evans against Newton.
We continue to press this as an alternative ground
for a decision.
As far as Dr. Freeman is concerned, f/e think that both
the 1866 law and the constitutional provisions warrant Ms

obtaining relief.

He was punished.

The action was retaliatory.

It

12

was by way of reprisal, and we feel that this action may not

13

be permitted to stand under relevant authorities.

14

The case that is most analogous is that of Barrows

15

versus Jackson, which is discussed in our brief and ir the amicus

26

brief of the United States.

27

who had failed to comply with a discriminatory racial covenant

18

was sued for damages and this Court held that he could defend

19

by relying on the constitutional right of th© Negro who was in­

20

volved , that the law protected him in those circumstances.

21

think that the circumstances hare are certainly analogous.

22

There you will recall that .a party

We

We have reviewed in our brief the various charges

23

that were brought against Mr. Sullivan as the alleged basis for

24

his expulsion.

25

We have demonstrated, I believe,, that in-his -ex­

pulsion there were a whole series of charges that were brought
10

1

against him that were in the nature of- exaggerations, and in

2

some instances outright falsehoods, all of which served as .a

3

pretext to mask the hostility and resentment that the directors

4

of this association felt against him first for creating this

5

controversy by attempting to assign his membership to a Negro,

6

and then by not accepting the decision which they had made to

7

deny the Negro the assignment,,
An important aspect of the case "which 1 would not care

Q
9
10

to overlook, and I would like to deal with for a moment, if I
may, concerns the matter of damages.
In the supplemental brief that we filed, we attempted

11
12

to respond to a point which the Government had made in its

13

amicus curiae brief, namely, that the plaintiffs here, may not

14

entitled to punitive damages because the acts involved occurred

IS

before this Court had construed the 1866 law in Jones against

16

Mayer.

17

.e

We, I think, have responded to that in a sense of

18

showing that punitive damages are not foreclosed merely because

19

the acts took place before the resurrection of the 1866 law.

20
21

22
23

24
25

But the point I would like to make is this, and I did
not cover this in our brief because, frankly, what I am about
to say had not quite jelled in my mind at the time I wrote the
supplemental brief, and that is that we feel that there is a
right established on this record by both parties to compensatory
damages for the injuries they have suffered.

11

We think also that they are both entitled to punitive

!
2

damages and we think that this is an important part of the casef

3

primarily in the case of Dr. Freeman, because he is not xn this

4

country any longer.

5

in Tokyo.

He is now with the United States Embassy

3

The question of punitive damages, I think, as far as

1

Mr. Sullivan is concerned, is quite well explored in cur brxcr

8
0
10
n

and we have shown it on the record.

His expulsion from the

association was motivated by attitudes of hostility, resentment,
a desire to act by way of reprisal against him because of what
he had done.

These are the elements that constitute malice

12

and which are a basis for assessing punitive damages as far as

13

Mr. Sullivan is concerned.

23
24

Q

In Jones against Mayer, as 1 remember it, we

did not even decide that compensatory damages were available?
isnlfc that correct?
A

That is correct, sir.

q

Didn't we leave that question undecided explicit). /?

A

You left that question undecided, sir, and I must

say, with all due respect, there is a footnote in that case that
is a little hard to understand in which it is suggested that
the parties may not have, on those pleadings, made out a case
warranting punitive damages.
One, we have asked for compensatory and punitive
damages all the way along here.

The thing I want to indicate

25
12

• <*>

*1

here is that in the case of Dr. Freeman, there are no facts

2

that might appear from the record which would warrant punitive

3

damages, but I would submit that he was the victim of racial

4

discrimination, and that racial discrimination,, as a matter of

S

law, warrants the imposition of punitive damages.

These are recognised in other fields of the law and

11
iZ

we submit that when a person is the victim of racial discrimi­

13

nation there is implied malice and that punitive damages are

14

warranted.

IS

We feel it particularly important here in this respect

16

that is, to achieve the full effectiveness of this 18S6 Act, the

17

Court would be well warranted in giving meaning to this concept

18

of punitive damages.
In Bell against Hood, the Court said that their

19
20

severally protected rights have been invaded.

It has been the

21

rule from the beginning that the courts 'virili be alert to adjust

22

their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.
This case is probably one of the last for perhaps

23
24

some time that will come before the Court involving this 1866

£5

Act.

In order to give full effect to this law, we submit that
13

1

punitive damages should be awarded and should be recognized as

2

a valid remedy,,

The 1964 Civil Rights Act, the public accommodation

provisions of it, have no damage remedy attached.

ARGUMENT OF JOHN CHARLES HARRIS, ESQ.

U

ON EEEALF OF RESPONDENTS

15

MR. HARRIS:

May it please the Court, the rules of

16

procedure in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals require that

17

counsel must serve notice on the opposing counsel as to the

18

tendering of the transcript and give him a reasonable opportunity
•y

19
20

to examine it.
On the basis of the failure in this particular case

21

for counsel to serve me with adequate notice, the Supreme Court

22

of Appeals of Virginia refused to hear this appeal.

23

They based it on the case of Snead versus Commonwealth

24

which was a criminal case in 1959.

25

the transcript to the counsel. 30 minutes before he submitted it
15

Snead8 s counsel presented

?

to the Judge for certification, and on the basis of this* the

2

Virginia Court said that 30 minutes was not reasonable, and

o

therefore* since it was not reasonable* and the requirement was

4

jurisdictional* therefore* they would not hear Mr» Snead8s

5

appeal.

6

Mr, Snead served his five years in the penitentiary.
In the particular ease that we have here* the opposing

7

counsel* myself* received notice three days after it was tendere.-5.

8

One week later —

Q

You don't deny that you had actual notification.

A

I don't deny that X had it.

n

Q

13

Petitioner says that you had the record for five days*

I received a tele­

Or an opportunity to go over the record?

14

or something of that kind* and the trial judge postponed for

15

eight days the entry of the order until you had a chance to look

16

at the record.

17
18

A

Do you deny those facts?
I received a telephone call saying that the

transcript would be tendered on a Friday.

19

Q

When did you receive this call?

20

A

On a Friday, a telephone call,

21

Q

June 9th, wasn't it?

A

June 9th.

22
23
24
25

On the 12th, as of that Friday af terno :n

sometime during that Friday afternoon, I understand it was
dropped at the Judge's secretary’s desk.

You were also told that your adversary would

submit motions for correction of the record for hearing on

Of course, the Virginia Court construes this procedure

as jurisdictional? that it isn’t up to me in cases —

6

Q

No, but the question was whether you, in fact,

8

fore the Judge signed the settlement order.

9

you?

10
11

12

A

You did, didn’t

Before the Judge signed — yes, the Judge signed

it, I believe, sometime on the 16th.
Q

So this all comes down to whether the construction

13

of the rule that you hadn’t had these opportunities before they

14

were given to the Judge's secretary, or at least before the

15

following Monday.

!6

A

Right.

The

Virginia State Court has construed

17

this as not my responsibility, as the responsibility of the

18

other counsel„

19

20
21

Q

But the question for us is v?hether that is an

adequate State ground under all the circumstances here.
Q

I take it that the Virginia requirement is

22

construed by the Virginia Court as double-barreled — adequate

23

notice of the time and place of tendering, and an adequate

24

opportunity to examine.

25

I don't suppose you would deny you had

an adequate opportunity to examine this record.
17

damages., then the question is moot and this Court should not

11

consider moot questions, so I understand.

12

In my opinion, the only way ha can get damages is

13

under 1982, and if 1982, as Jones versus Mayer tells us, does

14

not allow damages, then the question is moot as far as Freeman

15

is concerned.

He is in Pakistan now and he is not asking for —

16

Q

Jones versus Mayer doesn't say that.

17

A

It says it does not.

18

Q

It just reserves the question.

19

A

All right.

It contains no provision, although

20

it can be enforced by injunction, expressly authorizing a

21

Federal Court to order the payment of damages.

22
23
24

25

Q

Doesn't the Federal statute say an action either

in law or in equity?

Doesn't it say that?

A

I really am not familiar with —

Title 42, which includes 1932«. in there — and. Mr. Brown, of

course , just admitted that there is no damages under the public

accommodations law; it is strictly conciliatory and there is a

provision for a referral to a mediation service.

and if wa look at the Sherrod versus Pink Hat Cafe, wa will see

13

that in that particular case it was an assault where they ruled

u

that there was no damages under the public accommodations law

15

but in the case of an assault in connection with discrimination

16

you could sue for damages on assault.

17

So in my opinion there is no provision for damages

18

under 1982 or under the public accommodations sections of the

19

Civil Rights Act.

The reason why wa don’t have more people in the Dis­

that it is further away.

It is too far to travel.

But prob­

ably if you lived in the District of Columbia and you would like
to apply, I think you would have £ good chance of becoming a
member.

The same thing would apply to Justice Marshall.
Q

The petitioners* brief, if I may just follow

Justice Harlan’s question, the petitioner’s brief sssms to say,
and I am looking at page 6, that the corporation’s by-laws

provide that shares may be purchased by adult persons who "re­

2

side in or who own or who have owned housing units in one of

3

the specified subdivisions„"

say that shares are limited only to those people, but the impli­

5

cation that I got from that brief was that they were limited

only to residents of the neighborhood or people who had been

tenants or residents in that neighborhood.

Thera is a geographical limit.

It. is a rather

There was a geographical limit that was originally

10

put in there but again, the record will show that it hasn't

ever actually been adhered to.
Again, there is one thing that is left off there.

13

It must also be approved by the Board of Directors as a require­

ment.

We both agree about that.
Mr. Brown, you have seven

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON W. BROWN, JR., ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. BROWN;

20

I would simply like to say that with

21

respect to the question of the attributes here that suggest

22

that membership in this association may be an incident of land

23

or real property, I would point out that there sure several

24
25

factors.
For example, the by-laws provide that shares may only ■
38

1

be purchased by residents of specified areas.

2
S

Q

But the by-laws don't say that being a resident

in the area is the only qualification, for;membership.

4

A

Mo, they do not.

5

Q

And the Board of Directors still has to pass on

C

applications for membership, although applications, according

1

to the by-laws, are limited to residents.

3
9

A

That, is correcti yes, sir,

I am just pointing

out that it has some of the incidents of running with the land.
Is there something. in the record that, indicates

10

n

that residents of these specified areas are automatically quali­

12

fied for membership?
A

13

Mo, they do not automatically; they are always

14

subject to the condition of approval by the Board.

IS

what you mean?
Q

16

Is that

Yes, also; but is there something in the record

17

that indicates that the Board automatically gave approval to

10

residents?

19

does the. record show that, just as an automatic matter, resi­

20

dents of these specified areas qualified for membership without

21

more?

22

Perhaps the Board had the right to approve them, but

A

Except that we pointed out on page 7 of our

23

brief that there had been 1183 membership shares issued in

24

this corporation.

25

Q

Is that in the record?
39

1
2

A

Yes, sir»

Pages 125 to 126, 1 believe.

It is

on page 7 of the brief, the record citation.

Z

Q

Have there ever been any rejections?

4

A

The record only suggests, as Mr. Harris indi­

5

cated,, that there was one possible rejection at one time, but

6

there is no indication in the record as to why that rejection

7

occurred.

8

9

Q

Do you agree with him that people who are not

residents of these specified areas may apply for membership?

to

A

There is some evidence in the record,.yes, that

11

people who are not residents of those areas may apply, because

12

there is this clause which provides that the area is sort of

13

elastic.

It can be extended by the Board of Directors.
But I would point out that these considerations are

14
15

not really controlling, that is, the elasticity of the boun­

18

daries.

17

question is

18

in this case, do we have the incident of either personal and/or

19

real property?

20

of real property alone is not the controlling question.

21

I mean, under Section 1981 and 1982 cf 14 O.S.C.’ the
do we have the incidence of a contract precedent

The fact that it may or may not be an incident

I would like to mention two or three other things.

22

For one thing, Mr. Harris suggested that if damages are not

23

allowed Dr. Freeman, the case becomes moot because he is not

24

entitled to injunctive relief.

25

We do not believe that is so.

Dr. Freeman, for example, is in the Foreign Service
40

i

of the United States.

2

and he should be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent future

*4

recurrence of the discrimination if he should move back into

4

the house, for example, where he lived before or some other

5

house in the neighborhood subdivision served by this association.
Q

6

He can retura to this area at any time

May I ask you a question that hasn't anything

7

to do with the merits, but how far is this club from Hunting

S

Towers?

9

A

It is about four miles south of there, sir,, near

10

Fort Hunt Road.

It is about halfway between Hunting Towers and

n

Mb* Vernon, off Fort Hunt Road, and it is in an area surrounded

u

by residential areas except on one side where it is contiguous

13

to a school yard, the Bucknell Elementary School. A public

14

school is contiguous on one side of this property.

15

Q

Is that the name of the locality. Buck Hill?

16

A

Mo.

17

Q

Bucknell,

18

A

That is correct, Bucknell.

Q

Before we get away from that procedural point,

could, you tell me this:

Oh, yes.

What is the scope of our review ox the

action of a State Court in interpreting its own jurisdiction?
Do we, for example, reverse if we simply disagree with it,
would have arrived at a different decision, or is there a higher
standard that must be met?
A

The question» I think, as I would read the
41

1

decisions, is whether the State Court, denied the appeals in

z

this case on arbitrary grounds, if it acted arbitrarily and

3

unreasonably, not jus did it misinterpret its own rule.

4

I may be wrong on this, but as I understand it, the

5

court will inquire into the reasonableness of the interpretatior

©

the State Court has given to State procedure.
Q

7

Yes, but the consequence is that if we do not

a

agree with the State Court, what vie would say is that this is

9

not an adequate State ground and we would get to the merits

10

here.

f1

A

Correct.

12

q

We wouldn8t remand it to the State.

13

A

That is correct, absolutely.

14

the case on the merits here.

15

we have cited in our brief on this issue.

You would decide

There are a number of cases that

16

The one thing that we feel is particularly important

17

is that the case not be remanded to the Virginia Supreme Court

IS

of Appeals, because they have already ruled that they do not

19

have jurisdiction in the case, and we have pointed out, for

20

example, the case of Nairn versus Naim, in our brief, which in­

21

volved a test of the Virginia antimicegenation laws where the

22
23
24
25

Virginia Supreme Court, under circumstances quite comparable
to this, refused to accept the remand and completely frustrated
this Court's mandate by failing to provida the kind of relief
that the Court had directed it to provide.
42

5

So we submit that this case should be treated as one

2

being on a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Fairfax

3

County, and it should be returned to the Circuit Court of Fair­

4

fax County for entry of a decree as ordered by this Court and

5

for the assessment of damages, that that is the only issue and

6

that it should go directly back to the Circuit Court of Fairfax

7

County»
Q

8

If you have a decree, I understood from your

9

adversary that the court hadn't passed on the merits of the

0

case.

n

Is that right or not?
A

The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals refused to

iz

accept the appeals and, therefore, it is no different from a

3

situation where a highest court, in the exercise of its dis­

54

cretionary jurisdiction, decides that it won’t review the case,

IS

and that is what the court did here, in effect.
There are no further matters for the Virginia Supreme

16
17

Court of Appeals to decide, once this Court has answered the

?8

Federal issues involved, resolved the Federal issues involved.

9

If that is so, then it should be remanded to the Circuit Court

20
25

of Fairfax

County.
Q

But the Supreme Court of.Appeals of Virginia has

22

never touched the merits.

23

was remanded there and they heard the case and decided with you

24

on the merits.

25

A

Let's assume hypothetically that it

You would have all you wanted, wouldn^t you?
Sir, you have already tried to do that once,
43

1

with all due respect.

You tried that once.

You told the

2

Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to take the case back, re­

3

consider it on the merits in light of Jones versus Alfred II.

4

Mayer Company, and that court refused to comply with this Court

3

mandate.
There are cases in this Court reported that would sug­

6

7

gest that an appropriate remedy in such an instance would have

8

been for us to apply for a writ of mandamus against the Virginie

9

Supreme Court of Appeals.

We did not do that.

We chose this

10

method of seeking review on a writ of certiorari in this Court

11

and have urged in our brief that this Court decide the case on

12

the. merits.

13

thing to do now.

We think that is way and above the appropriate

14

The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has already

15

violated its responsibilities under the supremacy clause of

16

the Constitution.

17
m

Can I ask you how many other swimming pools there

There are none to my knowledge in the subdivision?

listed in these by-laws.
