They are reflected both in my brief and

in the State’s brief without any' dispute.

I will not dwell on

that here,, other than to note the Stats apparently acknowledges
that the questions were proparly raised and preserved below and
the State apparently acknowledges now that the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments apply to the States,,
Your Honors, as I will discuss the interpretation of j
the terms"witness, compulsion," and ‘against himself in dis­
cussing the Fifth Amendment right- and I will also discuss w
reasons why Your Honors, ir. my opinion, the number 12 is fun­
damental to the jury system in this country.

In the State of Florida does the statute re­

A

Your Honor, we have a procedural rule which is

the effect as a. statute, which when I offer to disclose all my
witnesses, it is then required to disclose all of their wit­
nesses .
Q

But it is conditional —

A

It is conditional, Your Honor on —

Q

— on defense counsel making that offer?

A

Yes, Your Honor„

—

We have another statute that

!1

is not conditional, Your Honor, that the State, without any

12,

condition on our part, must disclose the name of their witness

13

upon whom the information is based, as distinguished from theii

14

witnesses in the case,

Q

1«

if he were the victim of the offense? presumably?

17

A

<8

Q

19

20

That would be the chief prosecuting witness,

Presumably? yes, sir,
Do you proceed only by information in Florida,

not by indictment at all?
A

Your Honor, the statutes in Florida provide

21

for indictment on capital cases? on noncapital cases, Your

22

Honor, the prosecutor of the State, which has a right to pro­

,23

ceed by any information, or least it's been in my escperience in

24

celebrated cases? even in misdemeanors sometimes, that they are

25

proceeded on by indictment 5 but this is strictly up to the
3

5

pr©s© nj/ting authorities.
Your Honors, the Fifth Amendment is starkly simples

Z
3

"No person shall be held to be a witness against himself.”

4

Your Honors., whatever this prohibition means, and 1 am going tc

5

get to this in a minuter this prohibition, Your Honor, is

6
7

utterly and completely without, qualification or exception;
absolutely.
This prohibition, the Fifth Amendment has absolutely,

S
9
10

positively never, ever ever subject to competing public in­
terest, regardless how vast these public interests might be.
Q

14

Are you talking about it now in the context

of —

*
A
Q

■ Alibis.
— well, I'm thinking of the defendant himself,

when you say it's absolute and subject to no qualifications,

15
do you mean that no one can make him take the stand under oath

16
and testify» or not under oath and testify?

17
A

1 mean, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Fifth

18
Amendment says this.

The cases of this Court, I think, which

19

20

I have cited in my brief —
Q

I was wondering what scope you were giving it.

A

Only the scope that this Court has given it,

21
22
Your Honor, because the State has argued in its brief that the

23
reason for the alibi rule is to combat perjury? that the

24
reason for the alib^

rule, Your Honors, is thatin the quest

25
4

I

1

for the search for truth, and in arguendo? Your Honora? X

2

concede of this? absolutely, for the sake of this argumento

3
i

I

But X would also concede, Your Honors, if they would

I

ask, and without being utterly facetious about it, that the

5

alibi rule would stop pollution and stop the war and anything

s

else, because, Your Honors? X think it's not subject to reason­

7

able question, that ’whatever comes within the scope of the

8

Fifth Amendment it is not subject to competing, state interests.

9

The State has not been able to show a solitary case which came

IS

22

within the Fifth Amendment that this Cou •: or any other court
has said — at least this Court has said, "well, even though
this comes within the Fifth Amendment, the rights of the State
inthis context is so great that we5 re going to bring it out of
the Fifth Amendment."
Your Honors, I suggested in ray brief, or at least
cited in my brief, an early case of Boyd versus the United
States, which had to do with the forfeiture of goods.

But, in

Boyd, this Court quoted from an English trespass case and there
the English Justice noted: "that trespass in the civil nature is:,
just absolute."

And I suggest that at least whatever the Fifth

Amentment says, that’s true here.
As the English case says,

if you are going to have ari

invasion of this privilege, you've got to go back to the common-j

23
24
25

law principles and find some justification for it and the
silence of the books, according to the English Justice, is the

1

authority against the invasion.

z

cite a solitary case of this Court or any case in principle,,

3

in history, which would sanction the use of an alibi witness.

4

The fact that I note, parenthetically that the alibi

5

rule has been proposed twice in the Federal Rules and rejected

6

but I don’t think that that is determinative at all.

The case has not been able to

Well, isn't it rather incumbent upon you to

8

show us why this is constitutionally invalid?

Here's a

9

statute or rales of law of the State of Florida which you say,

10

quite rightly, if it does violate the Fifth Amendment to the

II

constitution, even if you might think it is a good or wise

12

rule, is a violation of the constitution.

13

stand your argument, is what you've told us so far.

Yes, Your Honor, I'm going to

G

It's not up to Florida

find cases? it's

up to you to find the precedents.
A

I agree.

I believe X cited them in my brief.

But, I'm going to discuss now the interpretation of these
words in the Fifth Amendment, "compelled to be a witness
against yourself,"aand let's see what these words mean.
Let's taka the first one, which X think is the
easiest and that is "witness."

i

X believe, YourHonors, that th «F

State concedes that this alibi notice rule falls within the
s
I

1

terra "'witness/' and I think they correctly concede that.»

2

While they cite in their brief some or the physical test cases,

3

Schmerber versus California, the blood alcohol test,

I believe

'

4

they may not cite the fingerprint test cases., all going out­

5

side the Fifth Amendment privilege, and properly so.

6

As I understand the rationale of those cases, the

1

Court said that the Fifth Amendment, is related solely to

8

communications and that physical tests, not being communica­

9

tions, or not be documents, are not. within the Fifth Amendment,

10

And 1 only suggest to the Court thatthis rationale

11

should not be expanded a, day.- because since the State appar­

iz

ently concedes that the notice of alibi rule is within the

13

purview of the category of witness, let's leave it at that,

U

I note that one case that I cited in my brief,

13

Albertson versus Subversive Activities Control Board, was the

16

case which this Court said that Communists need not register.

17

This is the same thing.

The mere fact that it's a document,

18

a pleading prior to trial by counsel should not take this

19

Court — or this case, rather, out of the term of "witness/*

20

Q

The Communist case, of course, turned, to a

21

large extent, on the fact that there was an incriminatory as­

22

pect to the registration? did it not?

23

A

Yes, sir? that's —

24

Q

What do you see as the incriminatory aspect of

25

furnishing theanarass of witnesses?

Mr. Manner, assuming a case where the defen­

does not testify at the trial; how do you get that under the

Your Honor, the State says this, in answer to

your question, Mr. Justice, they say that should I, the defen­
dant, give the

antes of ray witnesses prior to trial to the

prosecuting attorney is accordin

to the procedural rule that

no notice can ever be.' given to the jury by way of opening or
closing argument. "Here the defendant supplied the State with
the names os the alibi witnesses? where are those alibi wit­
nesses?"
Your Honors, the State says that there can be no
argument like that to the jury.

They have not cited any cases

and I have not found the first case, Your Honor, which would
support their contention that should X comply with .the statute
rhat this alibi witness will not become known to the jury.
And I believe, Your Honor, that that is a context —Q

Don’t you think that before we pass on that,

we should have a case like that? shouldn’t we?
17

A

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

It wasn’t done in this case, was it?

No, Your Honor, it was not done in this case,

Your Honor.

21
Q

Well, how is it before us that seme prosecutor

22
might do it.

I only suggested this is what the --

Q

Xf we try to stop wh rf. seme lawyers might do in

the future, it will he a very long opinion»
A

2

No, Your Honor; I'm not suggesting that* I’m

only suggesting, Mr. Justice, that in answer to your question;
3

4

0
6

7

how, if the defendant would not testify, how the alibi notice
rule would be a witness*

I’m only trying to suggest a possi­

bility that the «State in arguing opening and closing arguments
to the jury, will announce to the jury that "the defendant has
an alibi; we do not believe that this alibi is proper*51

8
This is the other —
9
Q

10

That assumes that a prosecutor would say it

and the judge will let him say it, and that the State Court

IS

\z

won’t upset it.
A

That's four assumptions.
These are assumptions made by the State in its

13
brief, Your Honor*
14
Q

Well, which side are you arguing?

A

I'm arguing my side, Your Honor.

IS
The only

16
possible way that the witness rule can apply is if the defen­
17
dant does not testify he is in the context or what I am sug­
18
gesting.

How, the «State apparently concedes in its brief that

19
the alibi notice rule comes within the purview of witnesses;
20
at least as I understand that brief.
21
Q

That doesn't bind us, anyway.

A

No, Your Honor, but I only suggest that re­

22
23
gardless of whether their brief binds the Court, I suggest that
24
in the Communist case and the Schmerber versus California, this
25
10

!

Court held that witnesses mean "any communication."

Z

feel that the alibi notice rule is a communication within the

3

Fifth Amendment scope of "he a witness."
Q

4

And I

Well, what this requires the defendant to do,,

5

as I understand it, a specified number of days before trial,

6

ten days, is to give the prosecution a list of people who are

7

going to testify on behalf of the defendant, on his behalf and

8

in his favor, in support of his alibi defensa.

That5s what I mean.

How does this — 1 don't

It

really — certainly these people ziire going to be witnesses.

12

The defendant says they are going to be witnesses; there is no

13

problem about that, but how does this requirement violate the

14

defendant8s right against, or anybody else5s right against

15

self-incrimination?

Your Honor, As I read the cases, I, or at least

I, as counsel, have the full right of determining when I am
going to make this judgment as to when to put forth my alibi
witness.
Q

Well, perhaps that's true and it is true in

many jurisdictions, but what does that have to do with the self­
incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment?

monial "and "communicative," synonymously.

16
17

The test is not whether it's a' violation of

14
«5

I

Pi

Your Honor, the test as 1 read the cases.

Your Honor, is not whether the disclosure is incriminating.
As I read the cases, Your Honor, the test is whether this
evidence is going to used or whether this information can be
used by the State at trial.
Q

Well, I did not include in my question, any

incriminatory aspects.

I just said, "How is it that giving
12

1

evidence and becoming a witness, how does this test the Fifth

z

JVraendmentin its precise language?

3

on the precise language.

You said you were depending

4

A

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

5

Q

How does it test this?

6

A

One, I feel that the cases here bring notice

7

of alibi statute within the term of witness.

8

brings the language — the cases that I have cited brings the

9

notice of alibi rule within the language of "witness against

10

himself," because as I read, particularly like Garrity versus

11

New Jersey, Brown versus Walker, the defendant's absolute

12

right to remain silent.

13

at least as 1 read the cases, is not whether it is -•

14

incriminating.

15

stance that I am aware of the rationale has been that the

16

testimony or communication was incriminating, but I don’t read

17

thfeeFifth Amendment like that.

18

I feel that it

And the test of "against himself,"

True, that in most all instances, every in­

As I read the Fifth Amendment and. as I read the cases,

19

without taking things out of context, the test of "against

20

himself," is whether evidence from the defendant’s own lips is

21

to be used against him at his trial.

i

22

Garrity against New Jersey, as I recollect, was a
■

23

case where some policemen testified at a civil service hearing

24

and then this evidence was used in their trial.

25

record does a disclosure on it, but theoretically, these
13

Well, the

1

policemen would not have testified at. the civil hervice

2

hearing anything but what they thought, would have exonerated

3

them .
So, I don’t feel. Your Honors, that the test of

4
5

"against himself,” is necessarily incriminating and if may —

e

Q

I gather, for example, that fingerprints that

7

are taken before a trial are used by the prosecution against

3

the defendant, at trial.

9

the purpose of using if against the defendant at trial.

10

That's information they obtained for
And

you would not claim that, that in ahy way violated the privilege. ?

11

A

Not in the least, bit, Mr. Justice

12

0

Nor the blood test?

13

A

Not in the least, Mr. Justice.

14

Q

So, you really have to, here, to establish

15

that in giving the notice and the name of the witness this is

16

testimonial in the sense that they drew a distinction between

17

testimonial and nontestimonial in Schmerber and the other

18

cases«.

19

A

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice.

20

Q

That9 s what the whole thing comes down to?

21

doesn't it?

22

A

Well, I believe that the State has conceded

that it's testimonial.
24
25

1 think the State says, though, that

it's not compulsion and the reason that they say it is not
compulsion, I believe it was either the Chief Justice raised

14

1

or maybe Justice Marshall raised the question thafcsince this

2

alibi witness was going to be used at trial anyway £, there is

3

no compulsion about it.
And my answer to this. Your Honor is, quite simply,

4
5

that 1, as counsel, have got the absolute, positive right to

8

wait until the conclusion of the State's case before

1

make a decision as to whether 1 wish to put an alibi witness

8

on.

9
10
Vi

I

want to

We have, without a doubt -Q

Well, you don't have to put him on because you

have disclosed his name, though.

Your decision is not im­

!2

paired, except on this hypothesis that you went on with, that

13

it might be used in argument by the Prosecutor, but as Justice

14

Marshall said, that case isn’t here today.

IS
IS
17
18

How are you injured in this sense by disclosing the
name when you come to the decision of whether you are going to
put on witnesses?
A

Mr. Justice, 1 don’t believe that the Fifth

19

Amendment requires that I incriminate mysalf»

20

the Fifth Amendment says that I cannot be compelled to be a

21

22
23
24

23

I believe that

witness against myself and I believe that your point is cer­
tainly the most difficult that I have to overcome.
what is the test of "against himself?"

That iss

I believe that that is

the strongest argument that the State has that this is really
not against himself.

And the only answer that I have to this,
15

1

Your Honor, is 1 feel that X" have an absolute right* to remain \

Z

silent up until the very close of the State's case, that there|

■5 »

are factors that are going to be apparent only at trial, even

4

the composition of the jury that I am going to base my decision

5

on.

6

There may not be anything incriminating, and I be­

7

lieve that analogy is reasonable, if we uphold the alibi

8

notice rule the State car. come back and ask a. question of the

S

defendant by a procedural rule: "Are you going to testify*?!t

10

Well, I dont believe there would be any question

11

about that, as being invalid.

12

alibi notice rule the State can come back with a procedural

13

rule, "Give me the names of your character witnesses if you

14

are going to use them."

IS

Q

I believe that if we uphold the

Your argument goes so far to say that there

IS

can be no criminal discovery of any kind against the defendant

17

in a criminal case?

18
19

20
21

22
.23

24
23

'A

Hot quite, Mr. Justice, but almost.

The only

]

criminal discovery that I would sanction against the defendant j
is the notice of insanity and the reason that I believe that
the notice of insanity rule is good.

Notice of insanity is

very similar to the alibi in Florida, and I believe it's
predominant throughout the state.

If a defendant is going to

rely on insanity, he advises the State a certain amount of
days before trial with the names of‘his witnesses.

16

But there,

i

Your Honors, there is always a presumption of sanity and once

z

you file a — show that you are insane, this gives the State

3

an additional burden of proof, other than the facts set out in

4

the information, while, of course, the alibi

5

does not.

e

notice rule

Mr. Justice, in answer to your question.: the notice

7

of insanity rule is the only criminal discovery that I, as a

8

trial attorney would allow.

Well, it's not what you might allow; it's what

in your opinion, the Fifth Amendment allows.

Yes, Your Honor; I'm sorry.

Q

Suppose the defendant refused to give the

names, -what. could be clone to him?

Mr. Justice, the statute provides that the

alibi witness cannot testify.

The defendant in Florida can

There is also a provisionin the rule

that the judge, if the circumstances warrant, can excuse the
defendant from the provisions of the alibi notice.
Q

You mean they would decline to permit a

relevant witness to testify in his favor?
A

Your Honor, we're getting into the Sixth

Amendment right here, which X notice in my brief, of Washington
versus Texas.

And I'd like to only make this comment: that X

raised the point and X

lggested in my brief, that Washington

versus Texas, which was a case in which a defendant tried •
17

t

to subpoena a co-defendant who was not on trial and th?. Texas

procedure apparently was that a co-defendant could not testify»

3

I’m going to answer your question, Your Honor.

This

4

Court held that the Sixth Amendment right of compulsory atten­

S

dance of witnesses was inapplicable to the States.

8

1 did not specifically raise the Sixth Amendment during trial, I

7

but I have always relied on the 14th Amendment, and I suggest

8

only that 'this Sixth Amendment right», in the context,. Your

9

Honors, that 1 have presented it here today, is similar to our

'10

Now,, as

Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

fl

In answer to your question, Mr,, Justice, the law of

the procedural rule in Florida is clear that should there not

13

be notice given the defendant, or the witness, rather is not a

14

competant witness at trial unless the judge within the exer­

18

Q

Well, that didn't happen in this case?

17

A

No, Your Honor, because I complied — 1 re­

m

ceived the notice of alibi form? i moved for a protective

19

order on the Fifth Amendment grounds and also the Florida

20

Declaration of Rights ground in the 14th Amendment and ray

So, Your Honors, I feel that the number

12, whether

it3s good or bad or regardless, the number 12 is sufficient in

— rather it's fundamental to our jury system.

Your Honors, as I read it, the jury was always

12 or more and the reason the 12 came out —

In Socrates’ trial it was 500.

A

At least in the common law, Mr. Justice, that

s

at least 12 persons had to agree and if they couldn’t get 12
i
persons to agree they threw out some of the jurors and they
brought in some more jurors until 12 could agree.

1 believe

that, at least historically is how 1 read it, but I don’t know
the number of 12.
Your Honors, I’d only suggest here that the Bill of
Rights were enacted, not to

rotect the guilty ---* or rather, fcc

24
to protect the innocent; and the reasons which dictated the

MR. MC CRARYs

Thank you.

May it please the Courts

Respondent.

18

would like to respectfully address itself to the issues as they

19

have been raised in our brief.

20

The first issue being:"Are the due process clauses

22

of the 14th Amendment and the Fifth. Amendment .’privilege''
State
against self-incrimination violated by a/requirement that a

23

defendant disclose ten days rprior to trial, his intent to

Zt

25

First'1 would like to say thatFlorida”s rule of

and is not unconstitutional.
The rule is not designed in any way for a defendant

The rule is a rule of pro­

Now, the constitution, 1 do not think, does not

©

7

grant to a defendant .the right to so have the kind .of defense

8

so that the State cannot check the veracity of that defense,

9

and that's what he's suggesting here.

All that the constitu­

10

tion or all that we proffer to the Court today is that upon a

S!

written demand by the prosecuting attorney and we want to

12

straighten out a few of the concessions that we were supposed ic

13

have made, must be a written demand by the prosecuting afctorny

14

first to a defendant, asking whether or not he intends to rely

on an alibi defense.

17

who will testify for him.

If he so does, then and only then is ha

Mr. Justice, I think

it helps to avoid the popping up of phony alibis.

3

Q

How would it?

4

A

How would it?

5

Q

Yes.

6

Q

Because the State has an opportunity or the

1

State knows of the witnesses that the defendant intends to use

8

as an alibi, and the alibi statute probably states that if

9

the alibi, the defendant was not at a particular place at a

to

particular time, therefore he could not have committed a crime.

11

It give the state an opportunity then, if nothing else, to

12

nolle prosse, or dismiss the matter.

that it's testimonial.
What X think we're talking about here is that.

then should win, and probably would in many Instances, but we

3

have cases, and this Court or other inferior courts, probably

have suggested that the whole purpose of trial in both criminal

Why don’t you put him on the stand when you re­

quire that he give the names of the witnesses he intends to use!
A

Your Honor, this would be a clear violation of

12

all the cases that this Court has tried if we forced a man to

13

testify, and we're not suggesting —

Q

Well, would

this force him to testify?

15

No, sir? it does not,

Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with the

Q

Well, what does it require him to do?
28

It does

It simply requires him to disclose the names of

That he intends to use.

A

For alibi alone.

Q

If they can do it about alibi, why couldn’t

they do it about everything?
A

Your Henor^ 1 suppose they could do it about

8

everything, and 1 don’t think I’m in a position to discuss the

9

constitutionality of that principle on this occasion.

10

Q

But the real problem 1 have with the draft

11

is: do you agree that at that stage, Florida has no right to

ask him and require him to answer anything other than his

Oh, no? the rule does not go that far, as Mr.
The rule, to answer Mr. Justice Black’s question, j

specifically provides that if he does not comply with the- rule, i

the trial judge may exclude the testimony.

9

It does not say that

he cannot use that —

10

Q

If

And yet there is another provision in the.

constitution which says that a man shall be entitled to summon

12

witnesses that know things that are relevant, to testify on

13

his behalf.

14

A

Mr. Justice Black, I will quite agree, and 1

15

think that the same court that decided this case, the Third

16

District Court of Appeals, is mindful of this, and we cited it

17

at page 14 in our brief, Cacciatore versus the State of Florida

IS

and Wilson versus the State of Florida and the defendant did

19

not comply with the notice of alibi rule, and the court still

20

let those witnesses testify,

21

So that, the rule is not an unreasonable rule, because

22

you say •—

23

Q

24

Well, how do you know the next judge wouldn't

do differently and make him?

25

A

Well, I have to assume, from ray position' that

30
S

1

judges are fair and that they are knowledgable and reasonable

2

and that they will apply
Q

3

Well, then you would be saving then that the

4

fairest thing a judge could do would be not to enforce the

5

rule.
A

6

Oh, no, sir,

I certainly am not saying that.

7

I'm simply saying that the Florida cases that have been decided

8

on this rule, the judge has allowed the alibi witness to testify

9

even where the defendant, in some instances, did not comply

10

with the request.

11

Q

Why did he do that?

12

A

He thought it was the proper thing to do.

13

Q

Well, that was a violation of the rules, wasn’t

A

Mo, sir? it's not a violation of the rule,

it?

16

Your Honor, because it provides that the judge may exclude the

17

testimony.

Q

Oh, he has the right to cl© it if he wants to.

A

Yes, sir.

notice which he concedes is constitutional? and the advance

notice on alibis, which he argues is unconstitutional?

A

Your Honor, I think that they are both the same?

they are identical, except for the defenses,, you know, the

13

14

IS
18

Q

But he can't remain absolutely mute if he has to

give the names of the witnesses he11 s going to use.

here .

Have they always never enforced it?

I can't go that far and 1 think that I would

simply back myself in a corner and never get out if 1 said

that.

22

i

Q

X should think in your argument that you would

23

almost have to assume that if filenames weren't given the

defendant couldn't use those witnesses in his behalf.

what the statute provides can happen and that's what the

\

Isn't that correct?
Yes, sir.

And if we talk about the trial

15

strategy, there was nothing that prohibited the defendant from

16

testifying in his own behalf if he wanted to, at any time during

17

that trial.

What we are really talking about is a bit of truth.

Now, he can determine at the close of the State's

18
19

case whether he wants to put on alibi witnesses or he can de­

20

termine 15 days before trial that he wants to put or does not

21

want to put on alibi witnesses.
Now, the way it harms him is absolutely foreign to

22
23
24

ting.

12

suggested by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr,, Justice Stewart, in

13

the total effect of it here, it's absolutely harmless to the

14

defendant to have, those witnesses testify before he complied

15

with the rule.

Tfi@- first'-issue, is that certainly it's not incrimina­
What might have happened is not before this Court and as

16

The second issue as raised in our brief is: Do the

1.7

14th Amendment due process clause and the Fifth Amendment en­

18

title the defendant to a trial by a 12-man jury?

‘1©

Of course, I to understand or for us to get to the

20

core of this problem, we first must, necessarily talk about the

21

12-man jury or the purpose of jury trial as defined by this

22

Court's decision in Duncan versus Louisiana.

.23

majority opinion stated that the purpose of the. jury in the

m

Anglo-American system was protection against arbitrary power.

23

The jury of the peers gave this kind of safeguard from

Secondly, there have been decisions in this Court

saying that the Federal standard only requires that we adhere

to the essentials of the common-law jury»

essentials, we think that the essentials are:

person's needs should have a right to a jury trial in serious

offenses; another essential of the jury system is# we think*

That word “suggest" did not — I

The Court said or held.

But they were

only applied then in terms of the Federal standard.
Now, we have to look at what are the essentials of
the jury system.

Sears versus Petty (?) we think that this is

essentiale because of the possible confinement, a. unanimous
jury, and Florida complies with this.
But when we talk about the 12-raan jury, that is
nothing; tthere is no particular r©§t§©s for having 2.2 men on a
jury, as opposed to six men.
37

We find that the common law

1

the reason that we have 12 is merely a carry-over of the common

2

law at the time we adopted the constitution in 1789»
.

Q

Why does Florida distinguish by having 12 men

for some offenses and sis for others?

and that's involved, with a 12-man jury.

of what?

One should be tried by a jury of his peers*

which would suggest to me the plural of the word “peers ?1: would
mean more than one.

Historically we have seen# and I think it’s

lost in history that sometimes people were tried by 500 as has
been suggested today down to as many as three when this jury
system was developing.

But there is no statistical data

39

i

available that has been presented by the Petitioner that would (

suggest that a man tried by 12 is going to receive a fairer

trial than a man tried by six.

use 12.

anywhere in the States when the constitution was adopted?

Was anyone trying civil cases where a jury trial was required

with any fewer than 12?

Your Honors my research does Aot reveal that.

5

It does reveal that in Thompson verus Utah, before they were

6

a State, and I think this was about 1898, dfolded by this Court,

7

stated that Thompson wanted to be tried by eight people, some

8

number less than 12, and the Court said that the State of Utah

9

— not the State, the

10

Territory of Utah could not do this,

because they were under Federal jurisdiction.,
To me, the dicta sort of indicated that had they not

II
12

been under the Federal jurisdiction that he would have been

13

allowed, it would have been okay tc try him by eight people,

14

by a number less than 12„

13

Q

They use six now, don't they? or they did —

A

Your Honor, 5: think the State of Utah uses

17

six and I think that there are some 12 states that at some

13

trial proceedings throughout,"from the lowest court up to the

19

highest trial court, use less than six on one occasion or

20

another*— less than 12 on one occasion or another.

wasn’t it?

joined with Mr. Justice Harlan's words, that "there is nothing

8

significant about the number 12,"that we have come to get this

number based on the antiestablishment clause, that it’s basic

10

reference comes from the Bible.

The 12 disciples, the 12

II

stones, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 gates to Jerusalem.

12

And there is nothing significant about it.
And that six people could provide what Mr. Justice

13

14

White did say, that we want to provide a buffer between govern­

15

ment and the people so that this kind, of

kinds that lawyers would expect from 12-member juries.'5

We think that the 12-man jury should not be required
on the states? additionally, we think that the numbers game is
not essential to fulfilling the purpose that this Court pro­
nounced in Duncan versus the United States — versus Louisiana.
The sole purpose of the jury is to protect the

12

public and whether that number is six or 12 it is fulfilled and
