ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. CLARK:

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This is an action for alleged libel.
Petitioners are a small community newspaper, the

Greenbelt News Review, and its President.
The Respondent Bresler is a major builder-developer

in Greenbelt,

13

ceived wide publicity as to their importance and magnitude to

14

the community.

15

His building activities there previously re­

Mr. Bresler had numerous dealings with the city

16

counsel and other government agencies in an effort to get

17

their approval for his zoning plans.

18

19
20

And his counsel conceded in his opening statement that
counsel was a

public figure in Greenbelt.

Also, during this

period\he was a member of the State Legislature and later a

22

candidate for Comotroller of the State.
1
No actual damages were shown or claimed.

23

verdict was entered for $'3,000 compensatory damages, $12,500

24

punitive damages, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.

25

Two of the three articles which the Court of Appeals

21

A jury

relies upon to support this judgment are accurate reports of

2

public debate of two City Council meetings

4

city in which he tried to press the city into supporting his

request for higher density zoning for a large tract of land

?

two Greenbelt

He did this by saying that he would agree to sell

8

another tract which he owned inthe city, on which the school

8

board wanted to build a school, which the city desired.

He

10

would sell that only if the city agreed to his zoning request.

n

Otherwise, he would insist on lengthy condemnation proceedings

12

which would delay construction of the high school.

13

Wow, the first of the two articles relied upon by the

14

Court of Appeals, is in the joing appendix at page 211 and if

15

I may, since it's so critical to my argument I would like to

16

go through that article just the key points, shortly.

17

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Before you do, Mr. Clark,

18

I°ll just remind you and I dont want to inhibit you about

19

reading it, but yoifre not going to ask us to decide whether

20

the material should have justified the verdict, I take it,

2!

but rather your obligation here is to point out what error

22

there was in submitting the case to the jury? isn't that

23

primarily it?

24
25

A

That's correct

Your Honor, and my argument is

primarily that there is insufficient evidence as a matter of

The article makes — the article is now discussing a

It is only at this point that the article begins to

describe the very hostile public reaction at the City Council

meetings on this proposal.

reports that a number of people at the meeting accurately —

excuse me ~ the article accurately reports that a number of

10

people at the meeting characterized this proposal as an attemp­

to blackmail the city.

12

The sixth paragraph says:

"It seems that this is a

13

slight case of blackmail," commented Mrs. Marjorie Bergemann,

14

and the word wasechoad by many speakers from the audience.

15

Immediately after the reference to Mrs. Bergemann, a

IS

City Councilman is quoted as saying that it is not blackmail,

17

and he preferred to call it just a two-way negotiation.

18

Then the article goes on and lists other criticisms

19

and the following comment demonstrates exactly what the people

20

at the Council meeting objected to.

21

there is a need for a school.

22

need and says,

23

25

He said, "Everybody knows

The dev€;loper knows there is a

'we'll meet your need if you meet our need.'"

That’s what the people were referring to when they
were referring to this article as blackmail.
The second article is much the same thing.
5

It’s the

i

report of a second City Council meeting at which there was

2

further debate on the same proposal and the City Council

finally voted 4-1 to reject thatIn that article another

participant is quoted as saying, "Fight Bresler5s Blackmail."

And right after

that another participant in the debate is quoted as saying
that: "This isn't blackmail? but the legitimate advance of
Mr. Bresler9s right to advance his rights to develop this

Now, the decision below rests on the proposition —
the incredible proposition, I believe, that these articles
charged Bresler with the crime of blackmail and that
petitioners knew they were charging him with the crime of
blackmail.

But there was no evidence that anybody interpreted

this article as charging him with blackmail.

Bresler could

identify no one who read the articles that way.

He couldn’t

explain v/hy he, himself, claimed that they charged him with the
crime of blackmail.

He couldn't explain what conduct he was

supposed to have been charged with that would constitute the
crime of.blackmai1.
Nor was hffi able to explain why he ignored the articles
for nine months, until he brought this $2 million libel suit,

Well, then the jury was disregarding its instrue •

Under the instructions of the court it had to

find a libelous statement»

However, when you —-

Q

Did it find it?

A

Well, my point is that there is insufficient

evidence there»

I guess it did find it»

Ifyou read the article — everybody who reads

the article to that point, it is cleai: to them that that con­
duct is involved here, that that conduct has no relationship to
the crime of blackmail.
If the jury found that, and I don't believe they did
under the instructions — if the jury found it, my position
here would be that there is insufficient evidence from which
they could make that judgment.
Moreover, there is no evidence that the petitioners
intended this strange meaning.
8

The only evidence relied upon

%

by the court was petitioner’s testimony that the word "black­

2

mail"' in another context could charge the commission of a

3

crime.

indicated that Bresler committed a crime of blackmail.

And, that there was nothing at the meeting which

The Court of Appeals concluded on that testimony

5
6

alone, which assumed that the Petitioners intended to charge a

7

crime.

8

it would be difficult to conceive of a case in which there was

9

more convincing evidence that Appellants held knowledge of the

But,

And this holding, I submit, is nothing less than a

12

mockery of the New York Times Rule.

13

falsity, much less knovh falsity by taking a word out of con­

14

text and ascribing to it a meaning that is wholly different

15

from that which its context dictates.

16

You can’t establish

No one, I submit, reasonably can conclude from this

17

article that the petitioners intended to charge Mr. Bresler

18

with the crime of blackmail, which was defined to the jury in

19

the Court8s instructions as the extortion of money by threats

20

of criminal prosecution or disclosed embarrassment

21

of disclosure.

22

threats

The article, by making it clear what kind of conduct

23

Bresler was being cricitized, what that conduct was, that it

24

was publicly made, the proposal publicly made to the city,

25

completely negated any reasonable finding that the crime of
9

1

blackmail was charged or that the petitioners intended to

2

charge it.

3

Q

Are you saying that read as a whole, the

4

articles say, in effect, that Bresler was engaging in high-

5

pressure tactics to force the city to do something he wanted

done?

The other article in issue which the court relies on

21

to support this verdict, is an article entitled: "Charles

22

Bresler to run for State Controller," and it was to be on the

23

eve of his announcement as a candidate for State Controller,

24

25

ment in there that a numberof homeowners had started legal
11

And there is a state­

1

proceedings against hira for failure to make construction cor­

Z

rections in accordance with county standards.,

3

Now, the basis for this article is clearly set forth

4

in the record.

5

told the Mews Review6 s reporter, after a public meeting, told

6

the News reporter that they had gone to their lawyers, that

7

they had filed complaints with county officials regarding

8

their homes which the reporter interpreted as starting legal

9

proceedings.

10

Fifteen to 20 homeowners, at a public meeting

Now, many of these people were personally known to

11

the reporter, Mrs. Skolnik, or she recognized them as

12

residents of the community.

13

similar complaints from other people in the developments.

14

She had also previously

heard

All of the homeowners with whom she talked, identi­

15

fied Bresler as the builder with whom they were dealing.

16

SresXer, himself, conceded that he received a number of com­

17

plaints and he responded to those complaints.

m
m

subsequently turned out that one suit had been filed and two
of the suits were subsequently filed against — three suits

20

were subsequently filed against corporations in which he was

21

a principal.

22

Moreover, it

Now, the claim of falsity here is very narrow; the

23

claim of falsity here, that by saying "started legal proceed­

24

ings," that statement is false, because no suits had been

25

filed against him personally.

12

1

Now, the gist of the article, of course, was that a

2

substantial number of homeowners in the community were com­

3

plaining about defects in his homes.

4

court paid little attention to this article»

5

in denying a motion for a directed verdict that this article

6

didnst bother him»

7

That is tree.

The trial

He mentioned,

The Court of Appeals, however, said that the failure

8

by the reporter to check court records or to call. Bresler

9

before reporting thisinformation, was sufficient evidence to

10

constitute a finding of "recklessness,"

11

Q

Now, specifically, which information was that?

12

A

The information that the court said that Mrs,

13

Skolnik 'shouldhave checked court records to determine whether

14

lawsuits had actually be filed against Bresler personally.

15

And this finding is completely at odds with the holdings of

16

this Court in Garrison and St. Amant, but there must be soma

17

evidence that the publisher was aware 6f a possible inaccuracy

m

or probable inaccuracy.
I

19

There is no finding or evidence here that petitioners

20

had any doubt of the accuracy of this report, since they had

21

gotten their information from a number of homeowners who were

22

apparently responsible, who were, presumably, speaking from

23

firsthand knowledge and who had, in fact, complained to

24

Bresler and in fact, complained to their lawyers, they had no

I

25

reason to doubt this information or to investigate further.

And they were talking about Bresier and

17

Q

What were they accusing him of?

18

A

They were saying that he had failed to make

19

corrections in their homes in accordance with county standards

20

And they were claiming that he had failed to correct defi­

2!

ciencies in their homes that his development built.

22

Q

Correct what?

23

A

Deficiencies in the homes.

you say?

6

7

A

Of failure to make corrections; to bring their

8

houses up to snuff,

9

Q

Is that all?

10

A

That's all.

n

Well, the Court, responding to Mr, Justice White's

12

observation, I do find that the instructions here are clearly

13

wrong.

14

instructed that the defendant could recover if he showed

15

actual malice, whichwas defined as "spite, hostility, or

16

deliberate intention to harm,"

17

Throughout the instructions the Court repeatedly

Now, because of the instructions, the court ^id give

18

an incomplete instruction on the New York Times Buie, but he

19

failed to instruct the jury that spite, hostility and ill-will

20

as he had repeatedly defined it before, was not sufficient to

S’

21

permit recovery.

22

negligence as proof of recklessness,

23
24

Also the Court refused to rule out mere

I don't emphasize here these erroneous instructions,
because, as I pointed out, in the three articles

which

.

25

the court relied are clearly insufficient as a matter of law
15

to permit recover under the Hew York Times Rule»
Q

Is it your position that even if the instruc­

tions were correct

You could not recover.

that this unfounded litigation is such, has been such a strain

on this small newspaper that if we
