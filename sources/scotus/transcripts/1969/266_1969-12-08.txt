Number 266.

Sanks against

Mr. Padnos.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL D. PADNOS, ESO.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. PADNOS:

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

7

Court:

The issue presented in the Slinks cases is quite

8

different than the issue present in the previous case.
The issue presented to the Court today is whether

9
10

the State of Georgia may constitutionally creata a judicial

11

procedure which,, by the terms of the statute, discriminates

12

against all tenants and in favor of all property owners in the

13

state.

14

The issue is thus: whether a state can divide all

15

its citisens under these two categories and discriminate in the

16

matter presented in the statute.

x
The operation of the statute has been extensively
set out in the materials before the Court.

I might also say

that it’s been considered before ---- this statute has been con­
sidered before in the case of Williams v. Shaffer.
As the Court is aware, this is a statute under which
landlords evict tenants by going to the Marshal of the Court,
talcing out a warrant which costs §6 and without any further
proceedings whatsoever, tenants are evicted from their premises
The only way a tenant can arrest these proceedings is by filing
2

1
2
3
4

with the court a counter-affidavit and with that another bond
which the statute doesn’t even stipulate, to guarantee that the
landlord will not lose either his money or double his money at
the final determination of the issue*
The question these statutory provisions present must

5

8
7
S

10

11
12
13

14

go to the heart of the notion of due process , for. the Georgia
statute permits landlord to assert rights in a way completely
different from-the rights that the tenant has.

It's

fctant

to emphasise that this statute affooto all landlords and all
tenants and it doesn’t matter whether they are individual or
corporate; it doesn’t matter whether they have a valid claim or
have no claim whatsoever? it doesn’t matter whether the tenant
is scrupulous or totally disreputable; everybody is affected by
this statute.
This Court has previously dealt with an issue which*

13

16

we feel is directly on point in the Sniadach oasa^

The Snisdac!

case which was a due process case, like this one, involved the
17
18
19

20

taking of property from a parson before there was any court
hearing.

And that’s the crucial question; may a statute take

away somebody’s property without a court hearing?

In Sniadach

the Court held that it could not do so# and in many ways, this
21

22

case is even a better case than the Sniadach case.

We feel

completely within that case the Court need, break no new ground
23
24

to decide in favor of the tenant in the Sanks case.
We feel we have a much narrower feh&n theirs.

25
?»

For

;

1

example, as Mr, Justice Black pointed, out in the Sniadach case.

2

there there was a question of whether the action taken that led

3

to the case being brought in, was a final disposition of the

4

matter.

S

clear that once the tenant is out that's the final disposition

6

of that matter.

In this case there is no issue of that? it's very

There was also a question in the Sniadach case of

7
8

whether the matter involved was de minimus; that question was

0

raised.

There is no question about this case being de minimus.

to

Again, the tenant is out on the street and that's the end of fchs

It

issue.

12

There was also a question in the last case of whethe:

13

the tenant had — whether the parties to that case had demon™

14

strated poverty and whether they were actually going to be

15

affected by the operation of the statute»

m

specific judicial finding in the LowerCourt opinion of indigency

17

and it was impossible for the tenants to obtain bond.

18

will be affected by the .statute; indeed they would be affected

1©

were the action of the court not held up by these proceedings.

20

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

Here there is a

They

I notice in your brief, Mr.

21

Pacinos, the statutes involved, you give 61-303 and I gather this

22.

proceeding is to be done under 61-301?

23

MR. PADNOS:

24

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

25

Yes, sir.
And that it's not an action foa

money and cannot be?
4

i

MR. PADNOS:

2
3

Yes , sir; that is correct.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

Which, of course, Sniadach

did involve, a money judgment.

4

MR. PADNOS:

5

Yes, sir.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART;

This is an action only for

3

possession by the landlord and only upon certain limited ground; ;

7

am I correct?

8

9

MR. PADNOS:

Well, the theory of the statute is only

when a tenant is holding over may a landlord go into court unde::

10

this statute, but in fact, under any conditions.

n

condition when a landlord can't go into court.

12

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

There is no

Well, he has to go into court

13

and he has to take an oath, like a statement under oath in

14

court; does he not?

15

MR. PADNOS:

16

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

17

MR. PADNOS:.

Yes, sir.
That what?

He has to make a statement under oath

18

that the tenant is either holding over or owes

10

or owes money to the landlord.

20
21

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Holding over beyond the

lease.

22

I believe its

v
MR. PADNOS;

Holding over beyond the term of his

23

lease hold.

24

Court, the tenants in this case are tenants at

25

a good illustration of the problem with this statute.

And as Judge Williams pointed out in the Lower

5

wiIlf and that's
The

?

tenants are tenants at will, therefore under the law they are

2

entitled to a 60-day notice to vacat©; and theoretically the

3

landlord can't do anything against them, or take any action to

4

evict them until he has given them a 60-day notice.

3

doesn't work that way and what happens is the landlord can go

6

in under any condition.

7

But» it

Wow, as you point out, Mr, Justice Stewart, it

8

certainly would be possible for a tenant later on to bring an

9

action fdr false eviction, and indeed, the Georgia Supreme Cour

10

It
12

makes the same suggestion, but that doesn’t do the tenant any
■!
good once he has been evicted.
Again, as you point out, the issue involved here is

13

not money; the issue involved is possession and that's what the

t4

statute is $11 about.

15

MR, JUSTICE HARLAN:

16

MR. PADIIOS:

Is this an old statute?

The statute was first enacted in 1827,

17

I think, and has been periodically modified since then, but

IS

nothing of substance has really changed since 1827.

13

It's a curious anacrohium.

There just isn’t a

20

statute in the country in which tenants are subjected to such

21

a rigorous and immediate eviction and landlords are given such

22

gracious privileges as the Georgia Eviction Statute.

23

Indeed, in thinking about asking other people to be

24

— to submit amicus briefs in the case, we wouldn't think of

25

going anyplace else, because nobody else has a statute like thii
6

/e're just unique in Georgia in having this statute,

\

And I think it' s important when we are talking about

2

3

Lue process in the. Sniadach eaea, to make it clear that we

4

lon't feel that Sniadach was an aberration of the Court’s

5

blinking.

0

tas been doing for a lonci time, indeed, in Hoveyv, Elliott,

7

igein, which v?as certainly years ago, the Court there also-took

3

:he position that not only notice was necessary in 'order for

9

Lue process, but also an opportunity to be heard.

Sniadach was in complete context with what the Court

The usual requisites, as Mr, Justice Harlan said in

W

11

:he Sniadach case, the usual requisites of due process are

'32

lotica and a prior hearing.

13

.anguage in the Hovey case where the Court really gets quite

14

recited about the procedure in that case, which did not afford

15

m

Indeed, there is some wonderful

opportunity for a hearing, and said that a judqment issued

36

tnder those conditions wants all the attributes of the judicial

17

letermination in its judicial usurpation in oppressing and can

16

sever be upheld where justice is justly..administered.

n

This case, we feel, is quite like that.

There has

2t

seen notice but there is no opportunity to be heard unless the

21

tenant presents a bond which in our case, certainly, our
tenants are never able to present to the court.
MR.JUSTICE WHITE;

Would you say that it was only

inconstitutional for the state to require the tenants to pay reni
pending the outcome of the suit?

7

MR» PADNOS:

No* sir? as a matter of fact, that9s

what we do in our cases.
in this cases.

We have sort of invented a procedure

We have applied to the courts for a rule of

nisi t as it is called in Georgia, and we do pay our rent in
the court.

Indeed, in this case —
MR. JUSTICE WHITE s

Even if you claim without a

defense to the payment of rent or even if you claim that rent ha
already been paid, you pay it into court?
MR. PADNOS:

Well, we haven't had a case such as the

latter one, but we do have cases where the rent is in contest,
every day; and we also pay the rent into court.

The Georgia

Supreme Court, when this, was argued before them, said, "How can
you do it, there is no statutory provision for that."

And,

indeed., they are right.
The Lower Courts have taken the position that that's
fair and reasonable? that the contested matter be put into the
court and we will decide who gets it in the end? and we have
always paid our rent into court and it's being paid in the
moment case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Wall, have they expressed

that in terms of the inherent equity power of the court?
MR. PADNOS: ’ Well, sir, actually we9re not before an
equity court; we're before a civil court which has no equity
jurisdiction.

-

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

,

There are none in Georgia;

e
:

t

no equity jurisdictions in a civil court?

2

MR. PADNOS:

3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Do you have a separate

4

equity court?
MR. PADNOS:

5
6

No, sir.

WE have a separate equity court, which

also has other powers, but -—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1

Have they then expressed

8

this mechanism in terms of inherent judicial power?

9

they must have had something like that in mind if they were

10

accepting it.
MR. PADNOS:

11

12
13
14
15
16
17

X think they had something like that in

mind „
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Or was it by stipulation

of the parties# where no judicial discretion was involved?
MR. PADNOS;

1 think the way it's worked here is that

the judge has just issued an order so stating and saying that5s
the only conditions under which —

18

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

19

MR. PADNOS: Foregoing the bond.

20

And foregoing the bond?

MR. JUSTICE WHITE: And the Supreme Court of Georgia
now says that's not so?

21

22

I suppose

MR. PADNOS:

Yes, sir? but even since then it's- been

,

23
24

25

operating this way.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE: In the i »wer Courts?
MR. PADNOS:

In the Low®!? Court.
9

1

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

2

HR. PADNOS:

But. not in the Supreme Court?

Nothing has gone to the Supreme Court.

3

It may be improper to say so, but many people think that it’s

4

an unconstitutional statute and have been giving us the benefit

5

the doubt.on that question, so we have been' allowed to bring

6

cases in the lowercourt and. the judges all the time just look

7

down and say, "Wall, I shouldn't be doing this, but I'm going

8

to let you file it anyway."
That's about the way it has worked.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Nobody

The statutory language is: "Double

the rant reserved or stipulated to be paid."

That doesn’t say

that if. was only at the time; it doesn’t say it might be a
little later —
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

In this one sentence it says,

"future double rent until the tenant surrenders possession."
MR. PADMOS: Well, one court interprets it that way.
10

1

Indeed, the Fulton County civil courts, until we began to

2

present these cases, the Fulton Comity Civil Court attributed

3

that to be future double rent, and m far as? 1 know, where the

4

Legal Aid Society has not counseled in the cases, they may stil.'

5

do so.

The;y talc® a year's rent, because the court has just
\

6

decided that siss months is the amount of time that these cases

7

may last and therefore' they double that and they require every

8

tenant to pay a year's rent.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

9
10

whether it was a bond for single-; rent or quadruple rent.

11

MR. PADNOS:

12

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

13

MR. PADNOS:

14

But your point would be the same

Yes, sir.
It’s the bond?

It's the bond? it's the fact that all

tenants must pay it.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

15

So, there’s po denial of equal

16

protection between the rich and the poor in terms of whether

17

it’s single or double or quadruple?

18

MR. PADNOS:

19

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

20

Well, I nvsan not if you are an

indigent.
MR. PADNOS:

21

22

Wall, it .COUld b®*

Not if you are an indigent, it scarcely

matters.

23

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Which you claim to be?

24

MR.PADNOS: Which we claim to be.

25

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN;

Do you have a finding?

11

i

MR. PADNOS:

There is a finding? yes, sir.

Judge

Williams' opinion on Page 38 of the appendix; there is a
3

specific finding of indigency.

4

The issue that we present to the Court is the due

5

process issue.

6

many different ways we can go; the statute is wrong for so many

7

reasons? there are so many--defects in the statute. But, in orde:

8

to present the simplest issue, I present to the Court the due

9

process issue,&ich is just obviously wrong on other cases? on

10

It seems to me that on this ease there are so

common sense? on decency and on the law.
We could also argue the equal protection cases.

11

We

12

feel it's a clear violation of equal protection; equal protec™

13

tion between landlords and between tenants.
I could get into the question of equal protection

14
15

between.rich people and poor people, but I don't think wa ever

16

need to reach that issue, because the statute violates the equal

?7

protection simply by landlords and tenants.

18

That, Your Honors, is the essence of" our case.

19

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS;

What does the Court mean on

£0

Page 42, that we could have gone into equity and gotten a

21

remedy.

22

The next to the last paragraph on Page 42.
MR. PADNOS;

The Court there lists two very specific

That's one of the other problems.

13

I should also state that unlike Connecticut — I’m

14

not too clear on the Connecticut situation -— the Georgia bond

15

is not waivable.

IS

says you can’t waive the bond and again, the lower court

17

judges have just sort of been clearing their throats and looking

18

in a different direction and allowing landlords to waive the

19

bond when they wish to come in.

20

not supposed to be able to do that.

MR. Evans.

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Padnos did not, in his oral argument,

deal with the poverty question.

It is undoubtedly raised in

the briefs5 therefore, I would like to say a few things right
at the outset.
First of all, not every owner of rental property is
a wealthy slum landlord; nor is every owner of rental property
a public authority or governmental agency.

In Georgia many,

and I daresay most, landlords are very ordinary people, who
themselves ha?e to meet mortgage payments if they desire to
continue to be owners of rental property.
Now, the relationship between the owner of the
property and the man who has possession or use right, is based
upon contract.

In lease contracts, as in contracts generally,

the agreement is deemed to include all statutory provisions
flowing tothe subject matter of the contract, unless the par­
ties, by stipulation in the agreement, waive the statute.
In Georgia for over 140 years a lease agreement has
been deemed to include the agreement by the tenant that if he
doesn't pay the rent or if he holds over or if he is a tenant
15

i

at will or by sufferance he has agreed that the landlord has the

2

rights granted by Georgia8s dispossesorv statutes.
Appellant’s constitutional, contentions are based on

3
4

equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment.

5

shall address myself first to equal protection and presently

0

come to due process.

I

Working with equal protection I might start out by

7
8

observing thatthe mystique of the words '’equality and equal

9

protection" are somewhat like the trinity; it's much easier to

10

accept by faith than to understand; yet I think if there is to

1?

be meaningful discussion on equal protection or equality, we

12

must determine what kind of equality we're talking about.

13

There are, as I see it, two types: one is equality of treatment;

14

this is sort of a numerical equality.
The other type of equality is equality of result,

15

16

which is' a proportional equality.

17

quite important for the simple reason that the existence of one

18

would invariably negate the presence of the other.
To illustrate:

19

The distinction is really

college tuition at a state university,

20

There is equality of treatment if there is a .standard tuition

21

charge.

22

Hot^ever, it is obviously a denial of equality if you use an

23

app

24

would have to, in effect, deny equality of treatment by provid­

25

ing that one student must pay for something while another studeri:

That is equality of treatment; it is numerical equality,

>ach of equality of result.

16

To have equality of result you

1

does not have to pay for it; obviously a denial of the equality
!

2

of treatment»
Now, the first equality, equality of treatment is

3
4

the traditional approach used by the legislatures and courts.

3

I have given an example of tuition at a state university.

6

examples would be sales and excise taxes, payment of gas, water

7

light and utility charges, bond posting requirements for public

3

officials to enter into office; to asstime the duties of their

9

office.

Othei

All of these things are based upon equality of treat­

10

ment; there is no exception, based upon the result to an indi­

a

vidual, his financial needs.
This same approach has beer, traditionally, used by

■i 2

13

this court and I think all other courts, the decisions of which

14

I have read, in connection with fiscal requirements for narrow

IS
16
17

13
19
20
21

22
23

24
25

situations or narrow proceedings where it involves access to the
court; and I am emphasising "court" in a very narrow feyne of
proceeding.
Cases of this Court would include, of course,
Union Guano and Cohen versus Beneficial Loan.

In Cohen versus

Now, that issue, obviouslv,

Moment into —
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Doesn’t this statute give him ,,a

right to defend if he files an affidavit?
MR. PADNOS:

Files an affidavit with a double bond and;

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Is that what you are complaining
j

about; the double bond?
MR. PADNOSi We’re complaining abo„ut the entire oro‘
cedure, sir; that x<?e could not get -—
PTR. JUSTICE. BLACK:

He has a right to appear and file

and affidavit and then it has to be tried.
34

Why wouldn’t that be

%

all right if he had plenty of tine?

z

1*2?.. PADMQS:

3

unless he files a double bond.

Well, he doesn't have a right to appear

4

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

5

the chief point in your case; the bond?

That's why I asked you if that's

i
6

MR. PADNOS:

You are askinq, I take it, is if there

7

were no bond would, we object to — I think if would be all

8

right, then, if there was no bond.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK: Well, that's what I, thought.

10

MMR.PADNOS:

That's what keeps us out of court.
s

11

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

How about this new statute?

12

The way Mr. Evans described it to me it doesn't sound much

13

different from the present -one.

14

MR. PADNOS:

I'm not familiar with that, sir.

I

15

really can't comment at all. What I was referrina to when I

86

talked about statute is that I know some statute passed the

17

State Senate.

18

to.

19
20

I'm not familiar with what Mr. Evans is referring

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

There has been no statutory enactments am I right?

21

MR. PADNOS:

22

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

23

MR. PADNOS:

24
25

The bill we are talking about.

Yes.

It just passed the State Senate.
A bill.

I know of nothing that has passed the

House of Representatives.
I would also like to clear up what I am afraid might
35

1

be a misleading impression impression that I gave about the

z

Georgia Legislature and also about the courts in Georgia.

3

didn't mean to give the Court the impression that we have a

4

sort of happy situation down there where everybody agrees and

3

everybody can do what they want, even though the law says the

6

opposite.

7

I

The Legislature, if this Court should hold this statute

8

constitutional, I would presume there is no possibility that a

9

legislature is going to change the present law.

10

Now, as far as the courts operating in our benefit in

!?

a kind of casual way that I talked about before, the courts are

12

doing that in Fulton County to a certain extent.

13

of my knowledge they are doing it nowhere else and, indeed, it

14

has not come to an end in Fulton County, because only last

13

Friday one of the judges in the Civil Court said, "No more; I'm

16

not waiving any more; I'm not going to hold up these evictions.’

To the best

We now have 52 tenants in one apartment building that

17

IS

are about to be evicted unless we can find a way to prevent

19

that.

20

MR. JUSTICE BLACK IIs that because of the bond?

21

MR. PADNG:

22

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

23
24
2$

That's because of the bond.
Is that the trouble with the claims

you are talking about?
MR. PADNG’S: " Yes, sir.

Me can't post the bond in this

case, because the tenants are not in. any position to cost a bon:
mi

-j o

1

in those cases and the tenants are not in any position to post

2

a bond and we're likely to be evicted and —
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

3
4

Are you goinn to be evicted

because of nonpayment of rent?
MR. PADNOS:

5

No, sir.

What they've been doing in those

6

cases is that rent is all paid into court in those cases, but

7

wesre not willing to turn the rent over to the landlord.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

8
9

Well, then the grounds there for

eviction is nonpayment of rent; is that right?

10

MR. PADNOS:

Right, Your Honor.

81

MR. JUSTICE WHITEs

Just as a matter of curiosity, what

j

1

12

is your defense to the landlord's suit.

13

of rent at the time the suit was filed?
MR. PADNOS:

U
15

Are you speaking of the incident case or

the ones we were just talking about?
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

16
17

Do you admit nonpayment

Well, this one and the ones you

were just talking about.
MR. PADNOS: Well, in the Sanks case, the defense -—

18

13

or the Moment case, let's talk about that, which is the Housing

20

Authority case.

21

that the

22

because she's having visitors from the opposite r^ce.

23
24
25

The defense is the one to which I just alluded'

ousing Authority has no right to evict a person just

In the Sanks case, our contention: were we ever able to
present it would be that there is no landlord-tenant relation­
ship, because there's apparently a common-law marriage between
37

t

the landlord and the tenant in that case

(Laughter}

MR. PADNOS:

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

S

MR. PADNOS:

8

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

7

could he appeal?

8

he appeal?

That's a very complicated case.
Is the judgment appealable?

The judgment of the lower court?
Yes.

If they were to oust him,

What about the judgment against him; could

9

MR. PADNOS:

Well, the present posture — I’m not sure j

to

I understand the question.

11

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Well, what I mean is: what court

12

does this start in?

Is this like some that start in the Justice

13

of Peace Court in some states?
|
MR. PADNOS:

14
15

Court, see — we can ever even get into court —
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

18
17

It can start in a Justice of the Peace

it.

18

MR. PADNOS:

19

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

20

If they post the bond.

they put up the bond and are denied can they then appeal?
MR. PADNOS:

22

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

24
25

What X #m talking about, suppose
(

21

23

You can get into court if they deny

Yes.
And how long does it take to get uo

to the Supreme Court of Georgia?
MR. PADNOS:

That han "Teen rapid, in our case, at least,

I’m not sure what the usual length of tine is, but it was
38

j

!

2

fairly rapid in our case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*.

Mould you think that

3

Georgia would have the constitutional right to require, as a

4

tradition for the relief you seek, the payments in the court

5

of all rent then overdue and monthly payments durincr the

S

pendency of the appeal?

7

MR. PADNOS:

I believe so, sir.

I think they could,

8

That seems to me equity in fairness and that's what we've been

9

trying to do, even in these cases as it now stands.

10

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now, what the Georgia

11

Legislature, at least arguably has done, is make an estimate

12

that double the rent will accomplish that same objectivei Is

13

that inaccurate?

14

MR. 1ADNO.S:
they have done'*

I think that is a correct decision'of what

It will protect the landlord's interest.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

But youthink the one is

all right, but the other is not?
MR. PADNOS:

Yes; I have to say that.

X think that is.

There may be inconsistencies, but it just ---- th4 rule of reason
it seems to me that —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Well, until I can think my

22

way out of that it does seem to be an inconsistency in your

23

position.

Perhaps there is an explanation.

24

MR. PADNOS:

Well, I'll pass to the next question.

25

I’d just like to make one final point.

39

The state

i'

1

continues in these cases to talk about the landlord’s property

2

interest and how we're expropriating it.

At one point in the

brief the State says, "A tenant's private war on poverty."
4

I think it should be emphasised that the tenant doas have a

5

property interest.

6

Supreme Court has specifically held that a tenant’s leasehold

7

is a property right that is entitled to as much protection as

8

the landlord’s right in his property.

He has leasehold and indeed, the Georgia

So, there are two conflicting property rights involved

9
10

here: leasehold versus feehold, and what it involves is just

1?

the issue of letting the court make the determination in which

12

its right is superior.
We ivant the right to go into court and that’s what this

13
34

case is all about.

15

Thank you.

m

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

17

Thank you gentlemen for your submissions.

18

19

20

Thank you, Mr. Padnos.
The case is sub­

mitted.
(Whereupon, at .1:05 o’clock p.m. the argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded)
