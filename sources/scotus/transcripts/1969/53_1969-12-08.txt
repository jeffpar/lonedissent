ORAL ARGUMENT BY PETER D. BAIRD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BAIRD:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court:

§

Petitioner in this cause.

10

My name is Peter Baird and I represent the

The case before is on writ of certiorari to the

It

Arizona Supreme Court, and it concerns refusal to admit

12
13

Petitioner to the practice of law in Arizona. She has graduated
■
from Stanford Law School; she has passed the bar examinationi,

14

and the refusal stands upon her refusal to completely fill out

15

a questionnaire and affidavit prescribed by the Arizona Rules

16

of the Supreme Court of Arizona.

17

I
j
There are two particular questions that are involved
■

IS

in this case.

19

was Question 25 and we set it forth on Page 3 of our brief.

20

This is, and I quote:

21

22
23
24
25

First is the question she did answer, and this

"List all organizations, associations

|

and clubs other than Bar associations of which you are or have
been a member since attaining the aqe of 16 years."
Petitioner did.

This

She listed each and every oraanization to which

she has belonged.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART: I looked through that brief
2

i

and then 1 looked in the appendix and I found that the form or

2

the questionnaire was there, but I didn't see the answers that

3

she gave to that question,, or indeed, any other questions that

4

she did answer.

5

MR. BAIRD:

Mr. Justice Stewart, we do not have as i
j

6

part of the record, the answers to the questions.

7

of the committee5s files and they were not introduced, so far­

8

as I know£ before the Arizona Supreme Court.

3

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

10

11

IS
16
17
18

That is part

And how do we then know, so

far as the record goes, that she did fully answer Question 25?
MR. BAIRD:

We allege that in our verified petition

before the Arizona Supreme Court and so far as I know this was
not denied, end the refusal to admit Petitioner is expressly
based by the committee upon her refusal to answer Question 21;
no* Question 25.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

There is something that just

occurs to me, and maybe I'm quite wrong, and in the course of
your argument maybe you will persuade me so, but that the

,

19

validity of the refusal to answer Question 27 might depend upon,

20

what answer was given to Question 25

21

22
23
24
25

d we don't know what

answer was given to Question 25.
MR. BAIRD:

That is true.

As part of the record

you do not know the names of the organizations to -which she has
belonged, which she did list.
MR.JUSTICE
STEWART:
V'
3

Well, I don’t want to throw

1

you off.

2

MR. BAIRD:

Her — Question 27 reads:

"Are you

3

now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party or

4

any organization that advocates overthrow of the United States

5

Government by force or violence?"
MR. CHIRR JUSTICE BURGER:

6
7

one question or more than one question?

a
9

Would you say that is

MR. BAIRD:

I would say, Mr. Chief Justice, that it

really is two questions, one which overlaps with the first

10

question, which she answered.

In other words, the reference

11

to the Communist Party would show up in a question which she

12

did answer; if she had belonged to the Communist Party it would

13

have showed uo in response to Question 25 and there is no con­

14

tention, I might add, parenthetically, that any of those reallyj

15

is the Communist Party.

j

So, the essence of her refusal goes to the require­

16
17
18

19

ment that she characterized the groups she belonged to and
listed in response to 25 as to v;hether they do advocate over­
throw of the government.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

20

Your brief, as I followed

21

your arguments in the brief, places particular emphasis on the

22

invasion of the Petitioner's right of free political association

23

but may I ask you this question:

24

half of that question, that is the question addressed to whe their

do you include the seond

.

25

there is membership in any organization advocating the overthrow

4

i

by the government, as an invasion of politically and constitu

z

tionally protected right to list the associations?

3

MR. BAIRD:

4

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes, we do.
That means that you

5

contend that there is a constitutional riaht, guaranteed and

8

protected right to overthrew the government by force and

7

violence?

8

MR. BAIRD:

That is not correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Doesn't that follow?

10

MR.BAIRD:

ii

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Well, I hope sometime

12

while you are on your feet you will explain that to me.
MR. BAIRD: I shall do it right now, as a matter of

13
14
15

No; I do not believe it does.

fact.
The question as to forcing her to characterize

16

whether any of the groups that she has belonged to advocates

17

the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force

18

and violence requires her to state whether, under the Smith

19

Act, as I understand it, any of them actually does advocate the

20

overthrow of the Government.

21

Now, the burden upon Petitioner is significant in

22

that respect.

It requires her to make various value jud-pnents

23

under the Smith Act, and therefore would make her less likely

24

to join these organizations.

25

in this kind of annorganination is unprotected conduct, I think
5

As to whether membership per se

$

that under the decisions in Elfbrandt, and perhaps in Rebel,

2

that one must actually have a specific intent to overthrow the

3

government; be an active member, know thatthe organisation

4

advocates the overthrow of the government and share that purpose

5

before that association or status may be proscribed.

6

The most significant aspect of Question 27, apart

7

from the freedom of association aspect, is the purpose for which

8

Question 27 is asked„ and this is extremely important in the

9

freedom of association area where the burden is not upon the

10

applicant to state why she shouldn’t have to answer it; the

n

burden is shifted to the state to come forth with a compellino

12

state interest to say why she should answerit.
The compelling state interest, which the state has

13
14

come forward with in this case, and presented to the Arizona

15

Supreme Court, is, and 1 quote as follows:
"Once we are to conclude that one who truly and

16
17

sincerely believes in the overthrow of the United States Oovern-

18

meat by force and violence is also qualified to practice laws

19

in our Arizona courts, then an answer to this question is,

20

indeed, appropriate."
The committee again emphasizes that a mere answer

21

22

of "ves," would not lead to an automatic rejection of the

23

application.

It would lead to an investigation and interroga)

24

tion as to whether the applicant presently entertains the view

25

that the violent overthrow of the government is something to be
b

\

sought after.

If the answer to this inquiry was "yes*” then

1

indeed we would reject the application and recommend qqainst

3

submission.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

A

Would you think that

5

this question would similarly inappropriate to ask a candidate,

6

an applicant for a job as a. police officer?
MR. BAIRD:

7

If the purpose were to seek not the

3

conduct of the police officer but rather his political beliefs

9

and views, I would say that it would be inappropriate»

This

10

Court has almost an unbroken chain of precedents saying that

12

that in any situations except thoseinvolving absolute discretion

by Speiser versus Randall.

In that case, where a tax exemption

was dependent upon the execution of an affidavit stating that
the Applicant did not advocate the overthrow of the government
this court inferred in holding that that denial of the tax
exemption was unconstitutional; that there was a frank aim at
suppressing dangerous ideas, and therefore it was unconsfcitutional.
We say that our case is even stronger. .The right

to practice law, which has been described by this court as far

back as 1867 as a right, is much more- precious - than a tax

The effect upon holding that belief is a valid

subject of inquiry for the State Bar or for any other govern­

7

ment institution, it seems to me to involve a tremendos amount

8

of deterrence, of thought control, of perjury problems if the

9

person is under oath, as to how to know whether an individual

*0

is telling the truth with respect to matters of the mind.
I guess one of our basic points inthis area was

12

made in 1867 in ex parte Garland where a former member of the

13

Confederate cause sought to be a lawyer, and was barred because I

14

he could not take the oath of office required of him.

consisting of moral or professional delinquency.

about whether or not such a belief might be protected inthe
abstract, in which I would suppose everybody would agree
with you.

But the question is about whether such a person is

the kind of a person who would have the proper ingredients to
he a lawyer and can a state which does set up standards for
admission to its bar, relevantly make such an inquiry?
MR. BAIRD:

Not into his mind? into his background,

his conduct; his character, but not into his mind, Mr. Justice
Stewart; because you could ask that sort of a question in any
sort of a context with respect to any kind of belief which
means some bar committee must have some value judgment in mind,
as to what is good belief and what is bad belief and as I under­
stand the Flag Salute case, in West Virginia versus Barnette,
this Court said that no official,, high or petty, has the right
to prescribe what

is orthodox politics, religion or matters of

11

1
2
3
4

the conscience.

And a man’s mind really is a very, very

highly protected right, in the abstract or in the concrete?
either way.

And it is our contention that this part of the

question which is aimed at belief can be sharply contrasted

5

from the oath which Petitioner is seeking to take, the oath

6

of office, which is sanctioned in Arizona by the rules of this

7

Court and by the Constitution, to support the laws of the

8

United States, and she is willing to do this and that is an

9

oath which is not broken by thought? it is an oath which is

10

broken by conduct? by unlawful conduct.

11

MR.JUSTICE WHITE: I take it you say that not only

12

may they not only pry into the mind, but that the Petitioner

13

is constitutionally entitled, not only to believe without being

H

barred from admission to the bar, but also to join an organisa­

15

tion with others who have similar beliefs, in the first place,

16

and secondly, to join ar. organization of others who have not

17

only similar beliefs, but the organization as an entity,

18

actively pursues -r.he overthrow of government by force and

19

violence.

20

that organization and still be a member of the bar and until

21

and less proved that by conduct he joins the activities of the

22

organization,? he joins in the activities of the organisation.

23

The Petition is constitutionally entitled to join

MR. BAIRD:

Mr. Justice White, X first of all say

24

that isn’t the case here, but X do wish to meet your point,

25

which is: when you move from the area of belief, the continuing
12

1

into conduct, and the closer you come to conduct the more
/

2

likely I am to say that the Bar Committee has every right to

3

examine that conduct and to make its determination as to whether

4

it indicates moral turpitude, or bad moral character.

S

1 would say that if an individual belongs to the

6

Community Party or some very unpopular organisation such as

7

that, or taken on the right side of the spectrum, the Minutemen,

8

or whatever, that that person, until he actually violates the

9

Xax</ by his conduct, I do not believe that he should be denied

10

I!

the right to practice law.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

Well, let’s assume that there

12

is some point at which his affiliation with the organisation

13

is qualified.

14

if he is a member of the organization?

15

May the state, as a preliminary matter, ask him

MR. BAIRD:

In our case, I say yes.

16

answered every organization —

17

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

18

MR. BAIRD:

20

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

21

22

You would say that they may say

to a person, "Are you a member of the Communist

19

We have

Party?"

Yes.
And disqualify him if he

refuses to answer.
MR. BAIRD:

Well, I think that probably is closer

23

to the fact of the case which will follow this one, than ours,

24

and I would say that insofar as Konigsberg and Anastaplo state

25

the law, that Petitioner in this case, as she did, must answer
13

i

a question asking for the name of an organization,,

2

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

It is a different question

3

whether they can disqualify her if she is a member.

4

stand that.

I under­

You think it’s a different question, too.

5

MR. BAIRD:

6

MR. JUSTICE WHITE:

You mean if she's already a lawyer?
No.

If she answers "yes," it's

7

a different question whether she can be disqualified from

a

practice.

MR. BAIRD:

If I follow you right, yes.

10

12

that they are keeping Petitioner from practicing law is her

MR. BAIRD:

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

Because Question 27 asks —

—• well, the answer is that she has answered Question 25, so

20

insofar as they would need that information to find referneces

21

to investigate Petitioner’s background and conduct» they can get
it, because they have all of the groups to which she belonged.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK:
MR. BAIRD:

is a valid purpose, they can use the answer to Question 25 and

Insofar as there was a valid purpose it could be

required under Konigsberg and Anastaplo to answer a question

9

asking for membership, because there is a possible valid pur­

pose.

11

Question 25, they need it now to investigate one's beliefs.

12

And it is our position here that beliefs are not a legitimate

13

subject for inquiry.

But, to ask Question 27, having already answered

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Are you suggesting that

Thatis correct.

No; I would not.

be the committee's answer which was presented to the Arizona

Supreme Court which ruled on the basis of that memorandum of

points and authorities, thereby, presumably adopting the

MR. BAIRD:

I would say that insofar as this case

is concerned, yes? because before the Arizona Supreme Court the
attack was clearly on political belief.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Well, what about this, Mr.

Baird — I notice on reading Mr. Wilmer's brief at Page 3.

He

says this: "The Committee has made it abundantly clear that
'regardless of the political views and beliefs of Sara Baird,
it is only if she is found to actively believe in the notion
and espouses activist's role inimplamenting the notion that our
government be destroyed by force and violence, that a favorable
recommendation will be refused her by the committee."
I gather the argument is that they asked the
question only to elicit the answer to — an answer to something
like this and if she doesn't answer it, that she absolutely
believes in or espouses an activist's role; that then she would
be admitted to the Bar; is that right?
MR. BAIRD:

Apparently, but that statement is a far

cry from the statement that they ---■
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:
19

Well, it certainly is.

1

It’s a far cry from what they stated In court in the memorandum.
MR. BAIRD: Before tbs Arizona Supreme Court it

2
3

said that it would lead to an investigation as to whether or

4

not the applicant presently entertains the view and if so, than

5

they would reject the application.
MR. JUSTICE BREIMAN:

6

Now we are posed, though?

7

or are we, in your view, with deciding this on the basis of the

8

memorandum or deciding this on the basis of the argument in the

9

brief? which?

t

MR. BAIRD:

10

I submit that it should be decided on

ii

the basis of the issues as presented to the Arizona Supreme

12

Court.

13

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

I suppose you would.

Let me

14

ask you this:

15

question were directed to what it has now said it was directed ,

16

to, that constitutionally Miss Baird has any claim?

17

do you suppose the committee, if indeed, its

MR. BAIRD:

Yes, I do.

I read the Committee’s
I

18

statement as still encompassing belief, because it says,

19

"actively believe?"

20
21

22
23
24
25

I still say that that refers to her

belief, as opposed to — "and espouses"

the greatest extent

would involve speech, and that does not coma close to the
Brandenburg decision

this Court enunciated just last term

where it said that, "You must espouse, direct at toward action,
and it is likely to produce action of an imminent violent sort/
or something to 'hat nature, which is really, again, a far cry

Erom this statement by the Committee.
MR» JUSTICE STEWART:

But Mr» Brandenfoerg wasn’t

an applicant to the Bar of Arizona»
MR. BAIRD: That is absolutely correct.

No

question about that.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

What's the posture of this

7

case, proceduraily?

I'm thinking I have in mind — concerned

8

about the finality.

In other words, if this Question 27 were

9

answered no, I suppose that would be the end of the case?

10

MR. BAIRD: 1 assume so.

n

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

And since it hasn’t been

tz

answered at all, is it a final judgment over which we can

13

properly take jurisdiction?

14

MR. BAIRD:

I think so.

In Konigsberg and Anastaplc ,

15

they did not answer the questions with respect to their asso­

16

ciations and it seemed to be final and in Schneider versus

17

Smith, where a Merchant Marine applicant was involved, he

13

refused to answer questions at that time.

19

them, I suppose that would have disposed of the case.

20

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

If he had answered

Well, sometimes I don'thave

21

in mind the precise posture of those cases, but sometimes it

22

results in contempt and what not; but that hasn’t happened here.

23

MR. BAIRD: No.

24

MR. JUSTICE STEWART: it’s just pending.

25

This is

just pending and if the answer is "no" to that question, then
21

1

that's the end of it, I suppose? she's admitted to the bar.

2

MR. BAIRDs

I suppose SO.

3

MR. JUSTICE STEWART:

And if the answer is S,yes/’

4

then there may be more proceedings and she may or rnay not be

5

admitted to the bar.

6

MR. BAIRD: Yes.

7

MR. JUSTICE STEWART: Why is it anything final over

9

which we have jurisdiction;at this juncture?
MR. BAIRD:

10

mittee can require an answer to an unconstitutional question

Yes, but that isn't what the

The question requires her to make a

judgment and the burden, presumably, is on her to see whether
they advocate the overthrow of the government by force and
violence.

This requires to deal and grapple with the issues of

the Smith Act and that kind of a burden was specifically condamned in Speiser versus Randall, where it said that the burden I

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN:
