ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. LOUISELL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. LOUISELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
In. some ways this is the most unusual of all the three-

10

judge cases, because, as I think I can show, the one issue

11

that was at least arguably involved here, the three-judge court

12

insisted explicitly on ignoring.

13

involved, they insisted on rendering the advisory opinion, on it.

14

An issue that wasn't at all

After I argued this case in January of 1969, in

15

reflecting immediately afterwards on some of the questions from

16

the Bench, I realised that I hadn't probably early enough in my

17

argument made it very clear just who the parties are, and that

18

the State of Texas as such is not a party to this case.

19

This V7as a three-judge suit brought by the committee

20

and by three individuals, apparently purporting to represent

21

classes of people, aid the suit was brought under the Dombrowski

22

case here basically.

23

The defendants, the County Attorney of the county

24

involved here and the other two defendants shall — and the

23

Justice of the Peace --- are the appellants in this Court.
2

The

I

Attorney General of Texas as the senior law enforcement officer

2

of Texas took over the defense of the three-judge case.

3

state itself is not a party to the suit.

But the

7

merits here are our opening brief and the brief for appellees

from the Bench primarily, we filed a.

It. seems to me that it is very important, as always' of

10

course, but particularly here because of the nature of what the

11

three judges did below, to be very observant of the facts.

12

December 12, 1967, President Johnson, and the press of course

13

announced it a little bit ahead of time, so that excitement and

14

interest was aroused, went to make an address and to inspect

21

aid in the protection of the President.

In an appraisal of the past year the Court, of course,

23

will be aware that this was just about four years of the shadow

24

of Dallas, Texas of November 1963.

25

At least seven members from the University of Texas,
3

4•*

and presumably a number of them members of this Committee,

2

organised a protest of the war in Vietnam, came to the premises

3

shortly after the President had begun to speak and they had theii

4

protest signs.

5

I perhaps should again remind Your Honors that Fort

6

Hood, I think, is the largest armored fort in the United States

7

At least 35,000 people are on duty there and at least 25,000

When the protestors, including the three individuals

13

plaintiffs here, arrived at the premises, they started to approach

14

with their signs and there is no claim that there was any impro­

15

priety about the signs and there is no claim, that they weren't

16

perfectly within their rights in a peaceful protest.

19

equity practice before 1912.

20

But imme­

I can't, really say that to the extent that there is

21

dispute in the facts, that there is any real resolution of the

22

facts in the opinion of the three-judge court, but most of the

23

facts, most of the significant facts are not really undisputed.

Actually the sheriff

10

himself was at a distant point near to the presidential stand

II

and when he saw the commotion, he came over to see what could

12

be done about it.

13

These three plaintiffs were turned over to one of the

14

deputy sheriffs.

There was some momentary confusion as to whether

15

the exact locus was in Bell County or in Coryell County, but they

IS

ended up in Bell County and when it was decided that it had been

17

within the territorial limits of Bell County, the sheriff author­

18

ized a disturbing of the peace charge against these three people

19

who had been taken info custody.

20

It is very important, at least I think it is of inter­

21

est to note that this disturbing of the peace statute as it then

22

existed in Texas and it is recorded on page 12 of our brief --

23

excuse me, page 12 of the joint appendix, and also it also appears

24

in our brief, provides a penalty in the maximum amount of $200.

25

But there is no provision for a jail sentence.
5

It is more lenient, for example» than some of our other

1

2

similar statutes.

The California statute, for example, has a

3

90-day jail provision in it, too.
There were some things that took place and here, of

4
5

course, you. have some conflict in the affidavits.

of the Sheriff of Bell County denies any brutality, denies any­

thing approaching brutality.

14

justice of the peace, according to one of the affidavits of one

15

of the young men, fixed a bail of $500 where the maximum penalty

16

was $200.

17

Of course this is a rural community between Austin and

The bail was immediately made — I shouldn’t say "imme­

18

diately," but very promptly made, the lawyer came very informally

19

and quickly provided the bail requirement and they were released.

20

Q

Are you suggesting possibly, Mr. Louisell, that

21

the absence here at the moment was affected by the fact that the

22

safety and security of the President of the United States was

23

not to be involved and that it wasn’t just an ordinary disturbance

24

of the county fair.

25

It is precisely that, of course, with what had taken

place just four years earlier.

One can understand the state of

On December 21st, the three-judge suit was started,
invoking the usual sections of the Judicial Code, 1983, the

17

Declaratory Judgment Act, and asking for a declaration and an

18

injunction against the enforcement of the section of the Texas

19
