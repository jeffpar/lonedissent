ORAL ARGUMENT BY MURRAY 1. GURFEIN, ESQ.

Mr. Gurfein.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. GURFEIN;

S

Mr, Chief Justice —

May it please the Court;

in this case was born in 1941

,

in June.

The Petitioner

He became 18 on June

m

23, 1959.

n

conscience and was indicted after an arrest in February of 1967«

12

almost eight years after his initial failure to register.

Q

Now, Mr. Gurfein, when you say he failed to

register for reasons of conscience? he did not make any record
or take any step, or did he at that time, to record that fact?
A

Ha took no steps, but if I may, Your Honor, in

connection with ray argument on the First Amendment, I should
try to expand on it a little further.

I5m trying to make a

summary statement of the facts now so that I can indicate to the
Court the three points we should argue within the short space
of time allotted.
Q

Viry well? very well.

A

The first statement I want to make on that is

that I will net get involved at this time in the reasons why the
record indicates that there was a sincerity of belief on the
2

1

part of the Petitioner that he could not take part in the

2

registration process itself, because his was a pristine re­

*.*

ligious view that the registration process itself, was merely

4

an extension of the war-making which he was against»
It should be recalled that in 1959 when the Petitioner

S

6

willfully failed to register there was no war going on»

1

Korean War had been finished»

8

time.

9

The

There was no Vietnam War at the

As I say, he was arrested eight years after the event,

10

The general statute of limitations, as we know, is a five-year

11

statute, and in the words of that statute, "except as otherwise

12

provided by law."

i

13

Adequate and proper motion was made to dismiss prior

14

to the trial on the basis of the statute of limitations having

15

run, which was denied.

16

counsel for Petitioner requested a jury charge to the effect

17

that if the jury believed in the sincerity of the religious

18

beliefs of the Petitioner and that his failure to register was

19

due to his religious conscience, that they should acquit.

20

request to charge was denied by the court and a conviction by

21

the jury ensued.

22
23
24

25

The trial was had and at the trial

This

In this Court, as we did below, we made three points;
First, that the statute of limitations is a five-year statute
and that tiny extension’Beyond it is beyond the legislative
intention, the Congressional intention and, indeed, the

3
I

1

prerogative of the Executive Branch®

2

Secondly, we say that if the statute of limitations

S

point is saved it is only saved as the court below indicated,

4

by holding that a regulation and not a statute, created a

S

continuing duty to register and that by juxtaposition of the

S

words, "the continuing duty,” even though Congress said nothing!

1

about a continuing event, ipso facto made a continuous offense,

8

as if Congress had specifically mandated,

9

construction of the statuta then it is violative of the Fifth

10

tod if that be the

Amendment privilege of the petitioner.
The last point, which I hope we shall have some time

!1
12

to discuss, is that we believe that under the First Amendment

13

the minimum that we are ashing here is covered by that amend­

14

ment; and that is that when a religious principle's objector

15

objects to registration as part of the process, while it is

16

true he must subject himself to the criminal process, at the

n

same time he has a right, when he is tried by the jury, to have

18

an instruction that if the jury believes he is religiously

19

sincere, that they should recognise, in the context of this

20

whole problem, his religious'-conscience under the First Amend­

21

ment.

22

Now, if X may turn first to the statute of limitations

23

.if Your Honors please.

As a result of the decision below by

24

the distinguished Second Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as

25

other circuits, we are now in this state of the law that a
‘4

t

narcotics peddler is subject to a statute of limitations of

2

five years»

3

government is subject to a statute of limitations of ten years.

4

A boy of 18 who fails to register for Selective Service,, is

5

subject to a statute of limitations of 13 years.

6
7

And the question is;

how did this come about and is

this harsh result sound?

8
9

A man who sells defense secrets to a foreign

Q

Are you raising

theconstitutional question

on that fact?

10

A

11

question, Your Honor.

12

Q

Any question?

13

A

Beg your pardon, Your Honor.

14

Q

Are you raising

In this phase I am not raising a cbnstifcuional

15

ment's power to do that?

16

tions?
A

17

any question about the Govern­

‘fo have different statutes of limita­

Nos I'm raising the question (a) as to the

S3

L.*fcgration of Congress, which has not expressed it;

19

without the intention of Congress, if Your Honor please, if

20

the regulation is construed as I have indicated it was below,

21

it is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by

22

the Congress to the President and that hence, under the Doctrine

23

of Separation of Powers, it was unconstitutional; yes, Your

24

Honor.

25

Q

(b) that

And the 13 years you got by adding five years
5

1

after his 26th birthday?

a

A

That is correcte

3

Q

After five days after —

4

A

I didn’t spell it out because I thought it. was

5

obvious, but what the court did below, in order to get around

6

this problem, was to say — although the regulation, which I

7

shall read in a minute — perhaps 1 ought to read it now*

8

Although the regulation says that "The duty to register shall

§

be continuous at all times," two circuits have construed "at

10

all times” to mean for life, apparently, because there are two

11

circuits that seem to have held that even if the man is over

12

26, or rather if the statute goes beyond age 26 he could still

13

be pro- ecuted, which uould make a man of seventy subject to

14

prosecution and this Court had a collateral problem like that
•

•

15

in Gar©, which was affirmed by a divided Court: 4 to 4 in 1950.,

IS

It was a collateral case and we really don’t know what the

17

Court held*
Now, in the Second Circuit they held that the regula­

18
19

tions merely limited to 26 and therefore, it's obvious that a

20

boy of 18 must wait until 26, which is eight years, and then

21

five years thereafter, is five, and that’s where I got my

22

13 years0 which is? exactly what was done below in this case*

23

Now, the regulation, I don't think, means — 1 say

24
25

this with most respectful submission, what it has been construed
to mean.

And I don’t think it needs much of a gloss as to what
6

1

was intended»

At page A-13 of- our brief, in the- appendix,

2

the regulation says, "The duty of every person, subject to

3

registration to present himself for, and submit to registration‘

4

shall continue at all times, and if for any reason any such

5

person is not registered on the day or one of the days fired

6

for his registration, he shall immediately present himself for

7

and submit to registration before the local board in the area

8

where he happens to be."

j

f

The word "immediately* is a very peculiar word if

9

to

you are talking about a continuing duty.

11

the fair inference of this is that in issuing the regulations

12

under the statute which permitted the President to £

13

or times and place or places, of registration, which naturally

14

Congress had to do.

It seems to me that

But all this means is that if a man was sick or absent

from the country or out of town, or something else happened
I

17
18
19

which was not willful, he should not believe that he was there­
after, forever discharged fromhis duty because at age 18 ha
could not register.
In other words, the word "immediately" makes very

20
21
22

23
24
25

little sense.

And I say if we take it in this context, Your

Honors, you have a vary simple administrative regulation haree
that does not, on its face, purport to create a real continuing
duty

and certainly on its face , says nothing about a

continuing offense.

7

1

2

Q

What would be the impact of that regulation

if you omitted the word “immediately,” in your view?

3

A

Well, I think '’immediately" is just a gloss

4

and 1 can't read the mind of the drafters of the regulation,

5

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

6
7

anything different?
A

3
9

Suppose we took it out now? would it mean

Well, I think the purpose of it is not to

catch willful! offenders who violate the law.

They are beyond

10

the pale.

1 think this is for the purpose of notifying people

n

who are perfectly, ready, willing and able to register under

12

the draft laws.

13

available ©n the day when they are supposed to register, that

14

they are supposed to register thereafter.

15

says ''immediately,” or not, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the same

16

results would follow.

17

tend to help us in construing it merely, as an administrative

18

regulation and not as the courts below did, as in effect, a,

19

substitution for a statute, extending the general statute of

20

limitations beyond five years.

It is a simple point, that if they are not

Now, whether it

But, I think the word "immediately" does

Now, the process by which the court below arrived at

21

22

extending the statute was by acknowledging, very frankly, in the

23

opinion of the Second Circuit, certainly is a distinguished

24

opinion in terms of facing the problems that arose.

25

they decided against us, we certainly cannot complain about the

beyond that»

It seems to us that in the historical material

2

that we put into the brief, Your Honors will see that going

3

back to England and going back to the colonies and certainly to

4

the beginning of the Republic, there has never been any ques­

5

tion but that a statute of limitations must be created by the

6

legislative and.not by the executive.

try to change by indirection, generally at the instance of the

11

English words.
Q

12

What do you say, Mr.' Gurfein, to the Court of

13

Appeals * view that this whole thing should be determined on the

14

basis of the statute itself and applies only between ages 18 and

15

26.

The regulation can't do any more.

16

A

17

Q

Well, can't do any more, but at. least it goes

18

five years.

1 gather the Court of Appeals rejected the inter-

19

probation you suggested that .someone might foe prosecuted at age

20

70 if they failed to register 52 years earlier.

.

21

A

22

Q

23
24
25

Cannot do more.

They did, and yet —
In fact, as to this fellow's brother, dismis­

sing the indictment, the brother being freed? is that right?
A

Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan.

The

point I am making is avery simple ones that there is ambiguity;

10

i

that you can have rulings of the other two circuits, which it

2

said it goes for all tints, as against the ruling of the Second

3

Circuit

4

Q

Well, 1 think you got —

5

A

They are both wrong.

S

Q

No? but 1 was interested in your answer to what

7

the Court of Appeals said in saying, .-Oh, you have to read this

8

really — the statute applies only between ages 13 and 26.

9

Then the terminal date for the beginning of the running of the

10
11

statute of limitations, which we concede is five years., is age 2 6?
and therefore it goes to age 31„
Now, that was, as I mentioned, was the gist of the

12

13

view of the Court of Appeals? wasn’t it?
A

U
15

myself to aaw.

16
17
18

20

22
23
24
25

Q

Oh, I’m sorry.

A

I —” no,

that’s right in line with

mythinking,

if I may suggest.

19

21

Yes, sir; and that is what I am addressing

Q

Yes.

A

When you

have a "continuingdutystatute,”

that

does not mean that you have a continuing offense by legislative
enactment.

I go back to an old case in this Court, United

States against Irvine, which goes back to 1870 or something like
that.

Xnfchat case the question came up of where somebody em­

bezzled funds, when did the statute begin to run?

11

It had been

1

held below that since he had a duty to return the funds, the

2

statute had not run »

3

which makes it a completed crime then the statute begins to run

This Court held that once an act is done

How, Congress itself, knows how to create continuous

4
5

offenses, as is evidenced, for example, bythe bankruptcy

6

statutes»

7

concealment of assets of the bankrupt or other debtor will be

8

deemed to be" — not a continuing duty — "a continuing offense

9

until the debtor shall have been finally discharged or dis­

The bankruptcy statute says very clearly, "The

10

charge denied and the period of limitations shall not began to

11

rsan until such final discharge or denial of discharge»

12

You will find nothing. Your Honors, in the Selective

13

Service Act which remotely relates to the statute of limitations;

14

or even to -the creation of a continuous offense»

15

And so wa say, analytically, as well as historically,

18

what makes it necessary to say if we are to adopt a liberal

17

construction of the statutes of limitations that just because

18

we have a duty, that that necessarily means that we have a. con­

19

tinuous offense»

20

Q

Well, you don't think, Mr. Gurfein, that the

21

statute, being applicable from pages 18 to 26 — the statute

22

itself requires one to register at some time between 18 and 26?

23

A

Oh, there may be a duty to register but we

24

should not take it out of the normal concept of the statute of

25

limitations»

12

Q

i

Welly I know, but if the statuta is to be readj

3

»
that way then why, up to age 26 isn't there a duty to register j
i;j
and not having registered, why wouldn't the five-year period

4

begin to run at age 26?

2

!

6

Because, under the normal rules of the statutej
f
\
of limitations, and of continuous
' •
es, I believe the rule '

7

is and should be, that once the crime is completed —

5

A

Q

8
9

Well, when is that completed — is it com­

pleted on the 18th birthday?
A

Letme put it to you this way;

.

|

It is completedj

10

'i

»

in this sense, that if the defendant were apprehended, let us

j

12

say, on his 19th birthday he couldn't say to the Prosecutor,

\

13

"Now, wait a minute, I still have time until I'm 26."

14

in the toils? he has committed a completed crime.

He is
!

And I say, Your Honors, if he has committed a com­

15
16

pleted crime, what is there to say by virtue of legislative

17

mandate, that that is to be treated differently from any other

18

crime?

19

Q

Well, is this ~ this, than, is an argument,

20

Mr. Gurfein, that — your argument then is that the crime, for

21

purposes of the statute of limitations, was completed on the

&

18th birthday when he failed that day to register? is that it?

c3
-4
5

Q

He was given five days.

A

Give him five days? whatever that was.

Q

And that's your statutory obligation, to

13

i
,

1

register within five days or you are guilty of an offense»

2

the sixth day you are guilty of an offense»
A

3

.And I can't defend myself by saying, !,Ng, I

4

have seven more years or five more years? I'm through»

criminal»
And that brings

Q

16
17

20
21

22
23
24
25

I would say when he came to be 23 he could not

Q

And furthermore, he had no duty to register

A

No.

I say he may have a duty to register, but

it there doesn’t have to be a criminal sanction.

There are

many duties in life in the statutes that we don’t have criminal
sanctions.

It happens every day,,
Now, if I steal your purse, 1 -certainly have a duty

18
19

A

between 23 and 25?

14
15

Well, you would say, I gather, that when he

b® ~

came to be 23 he could not be prosecuted»

10

if

right

I*m a

of the time --

9

On

to return it to you? I have a duty for life.

But as far as the

statute of limitations is concerned, you cannot apprehend me
more than five days after I stole the purse, but I still owe you
the purse.

And that's all I say is that there has been a gloss

upon a gloss here.
In the first place, Congress never said so and
Congressis the only one to say so.
14

In the second place, the

\.

1

regulation is ambiguous and in the third place at every rule of

2

liberal construction in criminal cases, the rules ought to be,

3

and we.think is, that the statute began to run when the crime

4

is complete and the test of when the crime is complete, is:

5

could the man have been apprehended at that time or would he

6

still have an offense.

7

tod that's our position on that.

8

Q

9
10
11

Mr. Gurfein, are there any analogies with

respect to registration of securities that shed any light on
this?
A

None that I know of, Your Honor.

The only

12

analogy is the Alien Registration Act, which raises the same

13

problem, in a sense, and where there has been seme differing

14

view, I believe that they have also held there that it is a

15

continuous offense; but I think the policy with respect to

16

aliens is a separate policy that would take too long to go into

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

here; but I think there are certain reserve power for aliens,
which makes it different.
Q

Is it not exactly parallel in terms of the

government's resources to go and find the people who are direetc d
by statute to register?
A

You mean does it affect their resources?

Q

Is there a difficulty?

A

Oh, there is a difficulty, but so is there a

difficulty in apprehending a thief or any common criminal.

15

And

1

2 don't think that these lads are in any different position

2

from any other criminals.

And that's why 1 use that analogy»

t may have seemed startling, perhaps dramatic, but the fact

3
4

that it does appeal to me as an anomaly that a narcotics

5

peddler should, be subject to a five-year term of limitations

6

and a boy of 18 should be subject to 13 years.

7

But that

8

Q

leave, because my time is running on that.

But there you have as in most statutes of

limitation, yon have the problem of the handicaps of defense

9

after a long lapse of time? you don't have that here.

10

11

A

That is true.

12

Q

This is a mathematical equation you are dealing

A

That is true.

with here.

13
14

limitation is only for that reason, but also for reasons of

S

repose, as the courts have often said.

16

How, X'm up to the second point and X am sure X won't

17

have time for the third and 1*11 mail it to four Honors.

18
19

X don't believe that the.

saving five minutes .for the rebuttal.
.

The — once you say that the only reason Toussie, the

20
21

22
23
24
25

Petitioner here, is in trouble is because you extended the
statute of limitations because ha had a compulsory duty to
register.

Then it is if you were creating two statutes; you

have first the statute which makes him the criminal because
think we all concede, he certainly could have been arrested

And we suggest that in that context, and 1 must say,
the Third Circuit by the way, years ago in 1955, before this
whole saries of cases, indicated that there was a Fifth AMEndsaent problem in alien registration cases and we cited them in
our brief and they might foe of some interest.

They didn’t have

to decide it for other reasons.
And so we say that in this context the draft res is ter-;
*

and they are a class.

There is no denying the fact that there

have been a number of willful registers that these people are ir
a select class of the kind.., that this Court has spoken of, who
are asked to come forward, give their names under compulsion,
and hence, be subject to prosecution by the statute.

That's a violation of the law and if it's

He would be prosecuted.

Within five years?

Well, at any time after he registered; yes.

But, it would be your argument that that would

That's right.

If Your Honor please, I -think there is a difference
between the registration and the registrant — the nonregistrant
that has already committed the crime.

Oh, certainly.
Now, coming to the third point and I wish I had

more time to expand this, a self-incrimination argument, but I

think it’s obvious that it's either accepted or not, based on

Now, please regis­

Second Circuit, said that in theory it is true that a con­
scientious objector to the process of registration ought to
have a right to have a jury pass on the.sincerity of his belief.
But, unfortunately, they said — I don91 say "unfortunately,"
I added that, under present doctrine, we can't allow that to
stand.
And we query what an present doctrine fehould
support that result.

We think that there is no doubt that

Toussie stands convicted here because of his religious beliefs.
I don#t think the government says that he doesn’t stand convic­
ted because of religious beliefs.

If so, he is convicted for

the exercise of a First Amendment right directly.
Now, if he exercised that First Amendment right
directly, should he not have the opportunity to have a jury pass
on the sincerity of his beliefs?
In other words, in Sherbert against Verner and the way
the Court has been determining these First Amendment questions

Do you think there is a constitutional ob­

I think that under the free exercise clause of

the First Amendment, Mr. Justice Harlan, that there is very
little history to support the idea that there is no con!

scientious objection.

1 think Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, in his

dissent in Macintosh, spoke of the principles of the constitution.

He didn't mention any amendment, but it's obvious he

meant the First Amendment.
We know, too, that there never was conscription, until

17

the Civil War in 1863.

We know that at that time the first

18
19

20

ten amendments were considered to be limiting the power only to
the Federal Government.

The Federal Government had no army.

So, that I think all the resort to history on both
21

sides is inconclusive and I do believe that, when we read the
22
content of what is free exercise of religion we must do it in
23

a negative way in order to avoid the constitutional right under

the First Amendment, by saying "no.”

ORAL ARGUMENT BY FRANCIS X. BEYTAGH, JR,,

ASSISTANT-SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF
THE UNITED STATES

16

MR. BEYTAGH;

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

18

the Court:

As counsel has indicated, Petitioner makes what is

19

basically a three-pronged attack on the validity of the convie *

20

tion for nonregistration with the .Selective Service System,

21

He says first that the statute of limitations bars

22

the instant prosecution; he says second, that if it did not,

23

that the privilege against self-incriminafcion provides a defense

24

complete defense to his conviction; and he says third,

25

at all events, his religious beliefs provide a defense, since

23

1

they entail a conviction that he should not even submit to

2

registration or that

3

mitted that issue to the jury.

4

at the least* the Court should have com­

I think the central fallacy of the statute of limita­

5

tions argument was alluded to by Mr. Justice White.

6

as we see it* if Petitioner is correct* is that at age 23 when

7

he says the five-year statute of limitations would have run* he

8

will no longer be subject to registration; and I don’t see

9

anything that makes him subject, to registration* apart from our j

prosecution for failure to register at the time he should have.
Now* our view of the statute and the regulations
that we think properly implements the statute* is simply this;
When the District Court* I think* set it out perhaps as well, as
it could ba.

Basically the offense that Petitioner is charged

with is one of failing to register with the Selective Service
System* not simply upon reaching age 18 when he was required to*
but failing to register at all during the period of time between
age 18 and ag?

/b, during which the regulations* and we think

by fair application-of the statutas that the regulations sought
to implement effectually* required that perform his duty.
Q

1 don’t get that.

It seems to me if h© hasn’t

committed an offense* when five days after his 18th birthday or
— he has committed an offense — then you say it’s a continuing
offense* but only until age 26.

I should think it 'would just

continue until the day he dies.

I don’t understand the 26.

The purpose of Congress was to set out a group of
people in this age group to be responsible for registration.

That's technically correct, Your Honor.

But,

2

as we point out in the brief, one element in this offense is

3

willfulness and coming in at any time, seems to me, the more

4

remote, obviously, the less significant this is, but coming in

$

certainly ten days after would seem to me to raise a very-

serious doubt about the willfulness of his earlier violation

It is more

10

once a person violates a continuing or recurring obligation or

11

duty imposed by the government, whether it be a regulatory

scheme, tax scheme; whatever, he requires registration reporfcinc■.
The thrust of his argument is that once he violates

13
14

that, the statute of limitations on that offense starts to run

15

and thereafter he is insulated from any further compliance

16

because he could say that "’Any further compliance would in­

It also seems to us, and this is, I think, the central
point on which the Court of Appeals relied, is that there isn't
any real compulsion that's working on him to force him to come
in after he first failed to register.

it's whether it's compulsory self-incrimination; that's what

we're talking about.

suggests, is not the sort of compulsion that should be given

will take, is that if these people when they come in have not

13

sought to take advantage of the fact of their not registering

it has run five years arid the government hasn't prosecuted.

That's correct,

Q

Mr, Beytagh, could he register on — after

22

his 22nd birthday?

23

A

1 don't know whether he could or not.

24

Q

Hell, how could he commit an offense after he

25

is 26 if he couldn't register, if it's a continuing offense?
41

A

1

Welly under our submissi-on the responsibility
■

2

terminates at age 26? I have to agree,, and therefore he could

3

not commit an offense after that and the statute question would

4

be whether the statute would run after that time.

I

Several other comments on the privilege defense that

5

6

Petitioner asserts»

As I sought to allude to -— there is some

7

question of whether he even has standing to assert that defense.

8

He's made it clear?. indeed? .in his point — he has made it

9

demonstrably plain that he never intended to register at all»

10

Indeed? he said that his religious beliefs prevented him from

11

doing so.

12

So? it seems to us there is some real question
to say
about whether he5 s in a position/that he was deterred from

13

registering at some later point in time because of potential

14

self""incrimination .

15

17
18
19

2©

The Marchetti and Grosso line of decisions we sought
in our brief to distinguish thosg? it seems to us that the
distinctions are rather clear.

First they relate to initial

registration in an area permeated with criminal statutes
relating to people inherently suspect to criminal activities.
Petitioner? as counsel suggested? he's in that same

21

category once he has failed initially to register.

22

think that's so? as X indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart? there

He has not been sentenced yet, it’s under

of Justice as to an appropriate sentence.
There are questions that were raised during the

that that is part of the problem here, that — not that an
insanity defense was presented as such, but the question of the |
appropriateness of the punishment is one that is suitable for

MR. GURFEXN; Thank yon, sir.

first age group that registered in 1951, 18 to 26, and try to

13

apply the Court of'Appeals9 Second Circuit reasoning to them,

the man who then was 19 years old had a statute of limitations

15

of 11 years; the man who was 25 years old at that time had a

16

statute of limitations of six years; and it makes no sense, it

17

seems to us, to say that there is anything within the statute

that, makes 26 years the cut-off date.
Now, with respect to the compulsion, all 7 want to

20

say is this;
