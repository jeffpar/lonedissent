ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER HARDIN
MR. FRIEDMAN:

9
10

ii

Mr. Justice Black and may it please

the Court:
The principal question in these consolidated cases

12

which are here on certiori . to

13

District of Columbia Circuit is whether.,the Secretary of Agri­

14

culture has authority under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement

15

the Court of Appeals of the

of 193? to include in milk marketing orders a provision for the

16

payment of a •premium to farmers who are located close to the

17

center of the milk market.

13

More specifically, the case involves the' validity of

19

the so-called farm differential payments in the Boston-Rhode

20

Island milk order under which farmers whose farms were located

21

within 40 miles of the center of the market obtained a differen™

22

tial over and. above the blended price that all farmers receive

23

of 46 cents per 100' pounds' of milk, which is the equivalent of

24

one cent a quart.

•

25

1
f.

Also there is a provision in the order which' provides

3

1

for payment of 23 cents a hundred pounds for farmers who are

2

located in the next area, in effect, 40 to 30 miles from the

3

center of the market, but that involves a small percentage of

4

the differentials involved under the order and T. therefore shall

5

limit my discussion to the consideration to equally applicable

6

46-cent differential.

7

The present case brought as a class action is by

3

farmers in Vermont who are located beyond the area covered by

3

these differentials and therefore under the order are not eligi

It

The District Court and the Court of Appeals in
"
'
this case held that, the statute does not authorise these par­

12

ticular differentials and enjoined the enforcement in paying of

13

the differentials.

10

14

ble for them.

I

In so ruling r the Court: of Appeals relied squarely on

15

an earlier case, which I shall discuss, called Blair against

18

Freeman, which struck down a similar differential in a New York-''

17

New Jersey milk marketing order. Now I will say at the outset
that these decisions of the Court of Appeals saying that the

18

!
I

19

Secretary has no authority to include these differentials is

20

contrary to a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First

21

Circuit in 1939, 30 years ago, which specifically held fche.se

22

particular differentials.

23

To put the statutory issues in the appropriate frame

24

of reference, first, I would just very briefly like to refresh

25

the Court on what I am sure is already very familiar to it.

And that, of course, is why

tial in the Boston milk market is to reduce by 12 cents the

So it comes off the top of it?

SO

A

That’s right, they come off the top and then what

11

is left is divided up and the them of my argument will foe that

12

that is precisely as Congress intended the scheme to be.

13

Now, these farm location differentials had their ori­

gins a long time ago in the marketing practices of the 1920's,

long before there was any Federal regulation.

under contracts that various of the dairieshad with the coopera­

tives farmers whose farms were located close to the Boston area

received a great amount for their milk than farmers whose farms

are located a great distance away.

At that period

When I say a "great amount," I want to stress one

21

thing, because that la challenged by our opponents.

22

an amount that exceeded the difference in the cost of transpor­

23

tation between bringing milk in from the distance and from nearby.

24

The indications were that these men received roughly $1 more per

One of them was the fact, of course, that the farmers located

Q

But you can’t — how do the cows know that?

A

Well, this entails apparently some very involved

farming practices through the use of artificial insemination.

20

They are able to some cost to spread the milk production over.

21

The expression they use is ’’the cows freshen" and apparently

the cows freshen, some of them in a way that they produce their

I would just like to quote three sentences which wet

17

set forth in our brief on pages IS to 13, in which the Secretary

IS

explained why in 1964 he was rejecting both proposals to elimi­

19

nate the differential and proposals on the other side that the

20

differential should be increased.

21

He said as follows:

"Such farm location differentials

22

have been in effect under several New England orders since the

23

inception of the orders.

24

reflect in the pricing structure of the order the historical

25

It was found that customarily somewhat higher

6

values above those which normally reflected transportation

7

costs attached to milk produced near the consumption centers as

8

compared to market value of milk produced in the more distant

3

areas of the milk shed.
So if I may just very briefly recapitulate what I

«0
11

believe we have before us is the following:

'12

the time of Federal regulation farmers located close to the

13

Boston and New England milk marketing areas have always received

14

more for their milk over and above the transportation differen­

V3

tial than farmers located further away.

First, since -before

cultural Adjustment Agreement Act, it ratified, confirmed and
legalised all previous licenses, order and provision, which of
course includes the nearby differential provision of the Boston
order.
Just in passing, the Court of Appeals discounted this
and said it believed that all that provision was intended to do
was avoid a lapse under the statute and we have explained in our
brief while we think that was one of the purposes, the legisla­
tive history also indicates that it was furtherintended to
3.3
i

i

i

approve and confirm and ratify everything that it had done

2

before.

■e*

I would now like to turn to the statutory provisions

4

involved in the case, which we think determine the control of

5

legality of this farm location differential.

6

at the bottom of pages 2 to 4 in our brief and it begins with

7

the statute speaks of milk and its products, terms and condi­

S

tions or orders and says in the case of milk orders pursuant to

9

this section shall contain one or more of the following- terms

10

and conditions and, except as provided elsewhere, no others —

and then over at the bottom of page the milk order may provide x<

vi

the payment to all producers and associations of producers

13

delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices from milk so

n

delivered irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the

is

individual handler to whom it is delivered.

16

And then it goss on to say, "Subject only to adjustment

17

for volume, market and production differentials

18

employed by the handlers subject to such order."

19

customarily

Mow the Court of Appeals found that these order's were

20

beyond the Secretary’s authority for two reasons;

21

apparently believed, irrespective of use provision barred any

22

consideration of the fact that historically farmers were receiv­

23

ing a higher amount for their milk because a larger portion of

24

it was available and used for Class 1 purposes; and secondly,

25

the Court said this, in any event, was not a market differential
as that term is used in the statute.
14

First, they

relied squarely on the prior holding in Blair, and after saying

4

that it accepted naturally the holding in Blair, the Secretary

5

was barred from taking any account of the prior use of the milk.

6

it then went on and examined what the Secretary had said in this

7

case and concluded on the basis of the statements at the time,

3

he promulgated all the orders, that in fact he had relied on

3

this inadmissible factor.

Indeed, it was that factor that was the

The contention there was it denied a farmer whose

75
16

milk was being used for Class 1 purposes, it took his property

17

without due process of law and it was discriminatory, but he

13

wouldn’t get the full value of his milk but he would get only

19

the blended price.
And we think in Stark against Wickard, it is very

20

clear that that is the sole purpose of that.

21

Now, of course, under this arrangement all of the

22
23

farmers, all of the nearby farmers, get the identical price for

24

their milk without regard to the use made of their milk made by
the particular handler.

25

The statute speaks of the usage made of

Now we therefore think that the validity of these dif­

7

ferentials does rot at all depend on the *'irrespective of use"

a

clause, that the way you determine the validity of these differ­

3

entials is looking to the next clause, which deals with the

W

adjustments and differentials.

11

the critical question in the case is whether these differentials

12

are market differentials customarily applied by the h&ndle?:s.

S3

And therefore it seems to us

The Act, of course, does not define

market differen­

14

tials, and we think what this phrase me ■•.ns is a differential

15

that customarily has been applied by the handlers in the market.

16

17
18

19

Mew in the light of the history of the history I have
given, the statutory history
Q

How about, this phrase you are talking about the

on© appearing on the bottom line of page 3?

20

A

Yes, the {a),

21

Q

Market differential,

22

A

23
24
25

It would be

market differentials over the top customarily

applied by the handlers, et cetera.
Now we think that in the light of the history I have
given, the previous experience before Federal regulation, the

17

3

history has shown that Congress intended to adopt the procedures

2

formerly applied by the cooperative, the confirmation, ratifica­

o

tion of 1937, tliat this definition cannot be given the very nar­

4

row reading that the Court of Appeals gave it.

5

The Court of Appeals said that all that is covered by

S

the phrase "market differential" is payments which a farmer

7

receives for delivering his milk to the city plant rather than,

8

to the country plant.

9

they say, in the city market rather than the country market.

10
31

That is a differential for delivering,

That interpretation rests on a statement in the commit­
tee reports which so describes the market differential.

We thin]!,

n

in the light of all this history, that this description was

^3

merely intended to be illustrative of the type of market differ­

u

ential and it was not intended to define the outer limits of the

13

differential.

16

cated the reasons why this language was construed as the Court

17

of Appeals constructed it, it would not be particularly meaning­

IS

ful, there would be other phrases of this statute that would

19

embrace the type of differential the Court of Appeals thought

As set forth in our brief it is somewhat compli­

20 i??as the market differential.
Z\

Now as I have pointed earlier, in 1939 the ifirst Cir­

22

cuit upheld the validity of the market differential in the 1337

23

Boston milk marketing order and this explicitly held that there

24

#;ere market differentials.

25

And in addition to that, as we

develop' in our brief, we think this Court’s decision in the Rock
18

1

Royal case, although It dealt not with differentials paid on a

a

market-wide basis by individual handlers, nevertheless since the

3

operative language of the two sections of the statute is the

4

same as equally applicable„

5

Q

What do you think the committee report meant?

6

A

I think it just suggested that this was one of

7

the types of things,

I don't think it can fairly be said that

8

the committee was saying that is all a market differential means

9

I think in the light of the history and the broad language of fch

10

market differential, it was intended to give the Secretary the

Vi

authority to continue these payments»

12

Mr. Justice, I think the whole history of this statute

13

shows that what Congress was trying to do in this case was to

14

stabilize the milk market, to eliminate the cut-throat competi­

?5

tion within the existing pricing structure.

10

to radically alter the relationships that had existed for many

17

years among the different groups of producers.

18
19
20

Q

It is not intended

Do you have the end-use as being the test . 'or

justification for any differential?
A

Mr. Justice, it was the fact that payments were

Zi

tied to the end-use that led to this drastic and devastating

22

competition among the farmers driving down the price.

23

were attempting to do, it seems to us, was to eliminate a

24

factor leading to fee depression of milk prices and farmers fight­

25

ing each other to see which one could have the greatest share

19

What they

of the Class 1 market and preventing the handlers from using

2

this as a 'lever- to fight, them.

once that type of competition was eliminated, i t seems to ub

that what Congress was trying to do was to say that this was as

5

far as we could go.

10

But once that was accomplished,

You could eliminate this type of pricing competition.
If was not to be the radical realignment, the radical changing
of the structure of the milk marketing that results from this
decision below.
Now the respondents repeatedly tell us this is a very

1.1

unfair thing, that the effect of this differential is basically

12

requiring the farmers in the distant markets to subsidize the

13

nearby farmers.

14

has some value to the handlers, let the handlers pay for it.

15

Don't make us pay for it."

16

Ana they say, “If in face this nearby milk

This again seems to us to rest on the stated notion

17

that under the Act all farmers are to be treated equally.

18

think under the Act what it is is that all farmer^ are to be

19

treated equitably.

20

subject to the various differentials provided.

22

believe, the market differentials that here are permissible, the

22

farm location differentials are valid as market differentials,

23

it seems that it is quite immaterial with the effect of paying

24

these differentials is to reduce the blended price.

We

and if the handlers -'were given the discretion to decide to whom
to make payments for the additional values, how much under

the sort of thing that Congress was trying to prevent, the same

5

kind of cut-throat competition that you had back in the early

days.

This would he exactly

Finally, the argument, it seems to us, rests on a

dubious factual assumption.

53

long,run that they would be any better off, because ones you

increase the blended price in the Boston market, the result is

13

likely to be that handlers operating in other area?! will begin

16

to bring to bring their milk into the Boston market.

17

create a surplus and this will, in turn, result in depressing

13

the price in the Boston market and the end-result for all that

19

is appears is that the prices may be driven down and even below

Before Federal regulation commenced in these

What did happen was that as a result or bringing into the Boston

over 75 percent of the farmers in the market — by bringing

observations.

Mr. Justice Black, members of the Courts

This particular differential has no relationship

at all to any 40-mile zone from any principal consumption center ,
the City of Boston or any other city.

That was true of the

1337 Great Boston Order, but at the present time under the con­
solidated orders all dairy farmers within the State of Connecti­
cut and all dairy farmers within the State of Massachusetts other
than one county are all classified as nearby producers.
Initially under the Greater Boston Market Order there
were over 7400 distant producers serving that market.
suppliedapproximately 92 percent of the milk.

They

At that time

there were 672 nearby producers and at the present time, as the

39

3

petitioners have indicated , there are over 2,000 — approximately

2

2,200 nearby producers»
Q

3
4

So the percentage under the old regime was, the

nearby producers was something about 3 percent or so?

5

A

That is correct.

6

Q

And now the percentage is what?

7

A

Approximately one-third.

The significance of

8

that, Your Honor, Mr. Justice, is this, that under the Boston

9

order, the distant producers — the so-called distant producers

10

only paid under this nearby differential 2 to 3 cents per hundred­

11

weight .

12

reason that there were so many distant producers.

13

They did not have to pay the 46 cents simply for the

But at the present time it has grown like the p^overbiiil
Topsy and it has resulted in its incorporation into other orders
simply because of the fact that it existed in the Boston order.
Noxw in that connection I think it is important to
realise that this particular differential exists in only one
other milk order in the United States out of approximately 75
Federal milk marketing orders.

That fact conclusively indicates

Mow the result is under the computation in that exactly

24

there are not enough distant producers to pay this differential.

25

That is simply attributable to the fact that

in the amount of approximately $12.50 a month.

Undoubtedly that would have to be so.

17

And it does affect soma more than it does others.

21

could receive a differential irrespective,of where his milk was

Then we find that approximately that within one year

24

at least 1,000 distant dairy farmers were forced out of business

the Act would not be comprehended.

7

initially the. Agricultural Adjustment Act was passed for the

a

simple reason that all dairy farmers ware receiving very low

9

prices for thair milk.

10

It is our contention that

The fact that some dairy farmers had received higher

11

prices than others in the 1920’s has no real relevancy here.

12

The fact is that the private sector of the milk industry, the

13

cooperatives and so forth, there were varying prices that con­

14

tributed to the market instability here and it resulted eventual

IS

in all receiving low prices for their milk below the production

16

costs in the 1929 to 1933 period.

17

And consequently because of the fact that the state,

18

as this Court held, in Baldwin versus Sealy could not regulate

39

the price of milk when it moved across interstate lines.

20

The Congress was forced to meat this problem by the

21

enactment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1933.

22

vided primarily for solving the problem through marketing agree-j

23

ments and supplementing licenses.

24

agreements were at that time relegated solely to the prevention

25

of unfair trade practices and the Act was very vague and

In fact, Congress was well aware from different

8

reports from the Federal Trade Commission that the situation was

8

such that the Act would have to be amended if it was going to

10

be made workable.

And in 1935 they did so amend the Act so

11

extensively that it is referred to as the 1935 Act, which this

12

Court has also characterised as such' in some of its decisions.

13

That particular 1935 Act did away with the licenses

14

and it included a provision whereby the Secretary was author­

The Secretary, of

course, had discretion concerning which terms to include in
these particular orders, but he, of course, cannot amend the
Act or repeal it by including within it various provisions with­
out any statutory basis.
As the petitioners have indicated, the primary problem

23

involved here in this milk industry is not only that milk is per-

24

ishable# but also there is a surplus of milk, a necessary surplus

25

even in the short production production season of the year,
48

1

approximately 20 percent.

2

This, of course, results in a much larger surplus

«'1

during the flush production season of the year and this is a

necessary surplus and the Secretary has found as recently as

for all producers would be below the cost of production.

It is the contention of the respondents here that the
Congress was motivated to solve this problem by apportioning

or fluid milk price through the issuance of a program that called

2

for a uniform price to all dairy farmers irrespective of the

3

use of their particular milk.
Now, of course, this was the big problem, that some

4

3

dealers had a fluid milk outlet for their milk.

6

were selling to that particular handler or dealer were sometimes

7

able to obtain a higher price than other dairy farmers and other

8

handlers who were not able to sell in the fluid milk market.

just the opposite.

the Court.

It was a case thatinvolved solely handlers and it

was shortly after the passage of the 1937 Act.

The handlers

contended that it violated their constitutional rights to
require them to pay a part of the monies that they had obtained
from the Class 1 sales into the marketwide pool or producer
settlement fund in order that these monies would be paid over
to other handlers who had low flu-id sales.

Most of their milk

was disposed of for manufacturing purposes.
But it is obvious that the congressional plan could not
work unless there was a provision of this nature and also the
Congress did not provide for any great unusual situation hare.
They provided for minimum milk prices that the handler was obli­
gated to pay for milk.
50

1

The Court in Rock Royal held that it was not a viola­

E

tion of due process or the taking of the handlers1 property

3

to require him to pay the excess of his fluid sales over the

4

marketwide average into the producers settlement fund for dis­

3

tribution to other handlers who, in turn,, would pay these monies

6

to their own producers„

7

Row it is very evident that if a handler could not

8

retain these monies over the marketwide blend price and pay them,

9

to his producer, and was obligated to pay this into the fund,

10

that a dairy farmer that served that particular handler certainly

11

could not make the same claim that this could be accomplished

IE

indirectly through a nearby differential.

13

We contend that the words "irrespective of use" simply

14

mean that a dairy farmer is entitled to the payment of a uni­

15

form price irrespective of the use of his milk and in every case

16

in which this Court has considered the milk, they have indicated

17

that this is the interpretation of the congressional language.

18

Mow the intentions of the petitioners would actually

19

nullify the Act if they were to delete that language and simply

say that this means that you can pay a dairy farmer on the basis

EI

of use of this milk.

22

the Congress intended should be done.

23

This is clearly just the opposite of what

Now the petitioners acknowledge in the Blair case that i

In our brief we have outlined the reports of

ii

both the House and the Senate in great detail and it quotes the

12

language of the reports where the report does say that that

14

center.

18

2ones and fix a particular transportation charge for each zone

17

as related to the principal consumption center, because this is

18

where the milk is going.

19

course the Court in Blair held that this was riot a proper differ­

20

ential to justify the one that was in the New York order, which

2!

was very similar to the one that is in this order, and that

22

related strictly to transportation.

And you have to have the system whereby you set up

This is where it is produced, and of

Now if the petitioners — I don't understand whether

24

they maintain that that is a proper differential that would sup­

25

port location differential that would support the nearby

52

«■
i

differential in this case f but they seem to be limiting their

2

argument at the present time that it is a market differential.

3

Now .the reports clearly state that a market differ-

4

ential is a differential thafis paid to a dairy farmer for

S

delivering its milk to a city market rather than to a plant,

S

because in a country plant there are double handling costs

7

involved and the measure of this particular market differential

8

is normally the difference between the receiving costs at the

9

country plant and that at the city plant.

And the dairy, farmers

10

paid that particular differential because they actually perform

11

a sendee there and they accomplish a reduction in the cost of

12

the handler that maintains the various country plants.

13

The Congress, if the reports are examined, both the

14

House and Senate reports, show that they gave great considera­

15

tion to this particular 1935 Act because of the recent Schechter

16

case and the case of Panama versus Ryan, the other particular

!7

case that dealt: with delegation of powers.

18

It was very careful to spell out in- complete detail

19

what provisions the Secretary could include in his milk- orders

20

and we contend that there is no possible basis for saying that

2!
22
*1)0

24
25

there is any statutory justification for the nearby differen­
tial, when that particular differential is not even mentioned
either in the Act or in any of tha reports.
Now the Act provides for a volume market production
differential and our understanding of the petitioner’s contention

53

?

is that the market differential is simply illustrative in

a

nature.

3

Congress specifying the volume differential, the production 'dif­

4

ferential , the butterfat differential, quality differential,

5

the location differential.

6

customary market differentials, that this was what they meant

7

by "market differential.”

©

How if this was true, there would be, no point in the

They could simply have said all

But it was not, and this is clearly reflected in the
reports.

Incidentally, the nearby producer can deliver his

!0

milk to a country plant and still receive this nearby differ­

11

ential whereas the distant producer can deliver his milk right

12

to the market center and he does not receive this differential.

13

In fact, he has to pay the nearby producer this particular dif­

14

ferential out of his milk price.

15
16
17

So it is exactly the opposite of what the Congress has
defined the market differential to be, one for delivery to the
city market.

18

Also thecnly exception to the uniform price that is

19

authorised by the Act is one which is provided for in Section

20

8c(5) (d) pertaining to new producers.

He would receive a differential under thi:

fluid use of his milk on a historical basis, even though he had

2

Now this is a double inconsistency that cannot be

3

attributed to the Congress.

4

particularly applicable only to the Secretary and even if he

S

didn't pay this nearby differential to these new producers,

6

this simply could not be explained away by a second violation,

7

because the Act requires that all of the adjustments be taken

8

into account even in respect to these new producers.

to propose them.

But that ic the one side.

IS

What is the reason from the Secretary's point of view, the reason

17

why other milk marketing order do not contain these differen­

18

tials?

19

A

Well, he has not given a reason for other 1markets.

20

He has said in respect to Massachusetts , Rhoda Island and'Conhectil

2!

cut producers that historically dairy farmers in the States of

22

Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, because of their

23

location with reference to the large population concentrations

24

of New England, have disposed of a substantially larger percent­

25

age of their production for fluid use than have dairy farmers in
the up-counfry area.

56

I

Hence, nearby producers have been able to realize a

?

price higher in relation to more distant producers can be

3

accounted for by the advantages of the transportation to market.

4

Under marketwide pooling herein proposed and without

5

some adjustment mechanisms, the nearby producer notwithstanding

6

would be paid on the basis of average utilization of all the

7

milk in the milkshed rather than according to the utilisation

8

of his milk.

S

Now this is a direct admission of a violation of the

10

Act, because the Act specifically states that no dairy farmer

n

is to be paid on the basis of the use of his milk.

■tz

paid, a uniform price irrespective of the use of his milk.

1.3

Ee is to be

The Secretary also found that under a regulated market

14

the nearby producer also obtains the protection of the Federal

15

regulatory program and receives in many instances a higher price;

16

than he would otherwise receive.

17

prior to Federal regulation all dairy farmers were receiving

18

low prices and even prior to the 1964 Act, much of the local-

19

produced milk had been disposed of for manufacturing or surplus

20

purposes and it is just not an accuracy to say .that nearby-pro­

21

ducers consistently supply the fluid milk market.

22

So we come to a situation xiherk

•

. i.r'

In fact, as recently as 1946 the Secretary had to

23

amend the Boston order because of the fact that the nearby pro­

24

ducers were supplying milk to the country plants and were receiv­

as

ing actually a higher price than what they were entitled to at
57

I

a

those particular plants.

z

Now we also feel that this Court specifically stated

3

in Rock Royal that any variance between uniform prices would

4

aesulfc in a discrimination and would actually cause certain pro­

3

ducers- to bear an unfair burden of the surplus mferket, and this

6

is exactly what the nearby differential does*

8

ducers and it casts on other producers who regularly supply the

10

Now the Secretary has also admitted that, nearby milk

11

has ho inherent value that'should be compensated for by nearby

12

producers and in his New York decision all of these particular

13

factors were raised in apparent justification for this differ­

14

ential.

except the fact that he thought they should be paid on the

19

basis of the historical use of their milk.

He rejected all of them.

He rejected the factor of

He rejected the factor of
He rejected everything

20

And of course this is a direct violation of the Act.

21

Now also in the Hood case decided on the very same day

22

that the Rock Royal case was decided, the Court also stated in

23

that case that the producers that intervened in that case ware

24

not entitled to maintain a historical price under this particula;

The lower court had stated that the only right to a

the constitutionality of this Act, and that they were entitled

3

only to a blend price or a uniform price and we feel that the

4

Hood case is a direct authority for our position here that

historical prices are not the criterion for insertion into a

$

milk order, that the criterion is uniform prices rather than

7

varying historical prices»

came about was because of the different and varying conditions

Now we also feel that the Congress specifically

type of

alternative provision of the Act, all dairy farmers serving the

pooling other than markefcwide pooling which is called

It

does vary amongst the handlers.

12

Now this particular type of pooling, individual hand­

13

ler pooling, is only appropriate in a market where the supply

14

is very short and where there is practical '.uniformity amongst

15

all handlers, and this type of pooling has been found to be

IS

inappropriate for this particular market.

17

But the important thing is that in order to institute ■

13

the type of pooling that Congress has provided that every pro­

13

ducer should have one vote on that particular issue alone in a

20

separate referendum on that one issue, and in our mind this indi­

21

cates that the Congress was concerned that the associations ccul<

22

sometimes yate in different things that would affect their mem­

23

bership if they had failed to consult with them.

24

The Congress wanted to preclude this type of happening.

25

Also we would like to point out that in respect to

summary judg-uc-ht that the Is-ehlgh Valley case was heard on motion

2

for summary judgment.

The Mew York Guernsey Producers versus

indeed the petitioners here proposed in January, shortly after

5

the institution of this suit, that the case be heard on cress-

6

motions for summary judgment.

7

Mow subsequently they withdrew that particular pro­

posal , but nevertheless they were desirous of disposing of a

suit at that time and nothing was brought up in the District

Court that would in any way reflect on the propriety of grant­

ing of summary judgment.

12.

The record was very voluminous, five large files and

?3

the administrative record numbered many hundreds of pages, as

14

is illustrated by the 753-page appendix here before this Court.

15

So every facet of this particular differential was considered

16
17
T8
19

and also the Act requires that the Secretary institute only
differentials that have bean customarily applied by handlers.
Mow the record, the administrative record, reflects
that this differential hid never been applied by handlers and

Also the similar differentials that they are- referring

14

to actually is what was known under the Act as "base ratings."

15

Base rating requires that all dairy farmers receive the same

16

fluid or Class 1 milk price for their base milk, but under the

1936 order only the nearby producer received a Class 1 or

18

fluid price for his base milk.

Many producers were never even

A

It means this, that they compute the demands,

22

the normal demands of the market and they divide up the market,

24

the base is a quota that he is supposed to produced, so that

is referred to as “similar differentials" by the petitioners

13

14
15
16

the so-called similar differentials, because of the very fast
that they are related to use and constitute a violation of the
base, rating plans of the Act.
Now they have mentioned the case of Green Valley

?7
18
19

20
21

22

Creamery from the First Circuit as being an authority for the
promulgation of this particular nearby differential as a market
differential.

We would just like to point out that in the Green

Valley case there were no producers before the Court.

That was

a handler case for enforcement and involved an entirely differ­
ant issue.

23
24
25

Moreover, the Court there did not. even examine this
issue for the very reason that it was not proparly before the

66

1

Court,

This was the contention of the Government that handlers

2

could not question disbursements from out of the pool and that

3

therefore when the handlers attempted to raise this argument

4

concerning the nearby differential, the Government’s argument

3

was accepted that this particular contention or issue could not

6

be raised by handlers.
So we have the Government contending that they have

7

a

relied on the Green Valley decision when that Court actually

3

accepted its argument that that particular issue concerning the

10

legality of the nearby differential was not even before the

n

Court.

12

Also, the Green Valley Court actually failed to real­

13

ize that the market differential which it said was a valid dif­

Now there is no question but what this is a compensable

ARGUMENT OF EDWIN H. AMXDON, JR.
ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERMONT
ON BEHALF OF VERMONT, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. AMXDON:

Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court ?

My name is Edwin Amidon and I am Assistant Attorney

I

General of the State of Vermont here representing the State of

2

Vermont and its Attorney General and its Secretary of Agricul­

3

ture , Who incidentally are here today.
The legal argument has certainly been wall covered.

4
5

2 would just 3.ike to briefly emphasise some additional aspects

6

of the factual context.
Vermont, unlike I think almost any state in the coun­

7

8

try, is overwhelmingly dependent on the dairy industry, much

9

more so even than Wisconsin.

In addition, the overwhelming

10

majority of its dairy production is sold under this order.

ft

Vermont, dairy industry, secondly, is in a great deal of trouble

12

right now.

13

Third, unlike the 19303s when this type of differential was

14

first adopted, the coste of dairy farming in Vermont are now fully

15

as high as they are in South New England —■ taxes, labor, feed,

IS

equipment, the various things that go into the cost of producing

milk „

It has lost over a thousand producers since 1965.

Did that cost differential which you implied

A

Is that part of the differential?

Yes, Your Honor, I think that may have been

Q

It wasn't represented to be one of the grounds

in the Secretary3s submission here today.

A

That is true, Your Honor.

I believe that is not

sub

1

2

silentio factor, if 1 may say so.
Fourthly, unlike the 3.930 !s, which X think the accessi ­

milk is equal now fully to the milk of Southern New England

5

producers and evenness of production, Your Honors, if it for­

Fifth, I should say that the Vermont farmers who are

a

the overwhelming majority of the non-nearby producers have fougiv:

9

this nearby differential from the very beginning.

They have

10

never acquiesced in it.

11

course, when it comes to a vote on a milk order, they have to

12

vote for the milk order in order to avoid the chaos of unregu-

13

lated milk markets where they sell most of their milk.

14

They have always opposed it and, of

If they didn't vote for the order with this nearby

differential in it, they would be out of the ballgarae anyway,

10

if I may use that slang.

i
Sixth, there has been no record of any disruption of

the New York-New Jersey milk market since the decision in Blair.!

Seventh, and this has already been said, in Vermont

,20

we wonder why Vermont should be the only, shall we say, recipi­

21

ent of this nearby differential.

22

producers and this nearby differential is only found in New Eng­

23
24
2S

We are most of the non-nearby

land orders.
So finally in conclusion, it is our position that this
is not a nearby differential or a farm location differential.

72
i

I

It is not an authorised adjustment to the Agricultural Marketing

o

Act of 1937,

■A*

It is, in fact., — it constitutes really a de

3

factor tariff which must be paid by Vermont farmers for the

4

privilege of selling milk in Southern New England.

Thank you, Your Honors.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER HARDIN

8

MR, FRIEDMAN:

to

u

Mr. Friedman?

Mr. Justice Black and may it please

the Court:
I have just four brief points I would like to make in

12

rebuttal and each of them really arises in response to a ques­

n

tion of members of the Court.

u

First, Mr. Justice Harlan asked the question of the.

15

origin of this phrase "nearby differential."

16

colloquial phrase, but the Words the Secretary used.in his

17

order in 1964 he spoke of it as "farm location differential,"

18

which I think is a more accurate representation.

19

I think that is a

Now Mr. Justice Black asked the question whether any- j

20

body would lose as a result of this decision.

21

in the District Court in opposition to the motion for summary

22

judgments and they are referred to at page 84 of the record,

23

affidavits by some of the nearby farmers, which indicated that

expenses as a result, of the blended price they received.

2

Then 1 would like to refer ---

2

Q

Is there any finding on this?

4

A

No, there is no finding on this, Mr. Justice.

5

I would like to refer to two questions which Mr.

6

Justice Stewart asked.

The first you inquired, Mr. Justice,

7

as to how the cooperatives vote.

8

is, if there is a division, all the votes are cast in one

They do vote as a unit.

That

wav.

10 j represent the vote of the majority of the members ---

n

Q

Of the majority.

12

A

That's right.

And of course the evidence in this

13

case indicates that when this 1964' order was put to a vote, it

14

was approved by a vote of something like 89 percent of all the

13

farmers in this area,

IS

Q

17
13

But this so-called referendum is a plebiscite on

the whole order, take it or leave it?
A

That’s right.

Take it or leave it, and this is

IS

true of many situations you have to decide whether to do something

20

with the pros and the cons.

2!
22
23
24
25

Now finally I would like to talk just a minute about
this point that there are only two other orders in the whole
United States that have this provision.
Originally a few years ago there were four other orderd.
The New York-New Jersey order was struck down; an order in Chicc fo

74

which was subsequently vacated because of the unwillingness of

1
2

,

the handlers to accept certain changes; the present order which

3

was struck down; and the Connecticut order which of course i&

4

now under litigation before the Court of Appeals of the Second

5

Circuit.
These are only four out of 70 orders.

3

It covered

7

roughly 40 percent of all the milk production in the United

3

States and in addition to that, we have something which I think

9

is quite significant.

There is testimony in this record at page

SO

549 and X would like to refer to it, as to the extent of the

II

whole problem of how these differentials come into being, what

12

their cause is.
On 549 there is a statement as follows:

13

"In the State

14

of California, and the State of California is one of the states

15

that has no Federal regulation at all, producers located in

16

nearby Los Angeles distributing plants are able to obtain irtore

17

favorable contracts and thus a higher price for utilization than

IS
19
20

21

22
23
24
25

producers that are located in the Central Valley or any other
place."

In other words, even without a milk marketing order at
the present time handlers are willing to pay more to farmers who
are located near the center of a market than to distant farmers.
No coercion, no claim that the distant farmers are required to
accept this.
This is the normal operation of the market and I think
75

1

te reason 'why we don't have more of these provisions in mirk

2

arkefcs is it is just the way markets have arisen.

3

ountry, smaller areas, haven't had the problem.

4

loser in, you haven't had this kind of competition for the

5

ostly market that is characterized in these Eastern markets.
Q

6

Some of the
If they are

You would argue, I suppose, if you prevail in

7

his case, that the Secretary could introduce this differential

8

n any marketing order he wished?
A

Yes, depending on what the circumstances were.

t appeared that prior to the time of the marketing order that

n

hoy had this existing, I would ---

That factor would have to exist?

A

If, for example,

It would have to exist, because the

tatute speaks of market differentials customarily applied.
