much an equitable remedy as injunction and whether the court

A

Well, no, sir, if we are talking about a suit

2

for declaratory judgment in the federal court construing a

3

federal statute.

4

Q

But what about a state statute?

5

A

Well, as 1 say, unless it is a proper case for

6

an injunction, idle fact that the court decides that the

statute is unconstitutional is advisory, as witness the case

I think'abstention

HO

is a different doctrine, and there are probably 3 or 4 different

11

abstention doctrines.

12

But in the free speech area we do have a different

13

rule, and Bombrowski announced it.

Then X think,, as I read

14

Cameron as it interprets Bombrowski, 1 have no trouble at all

IS

with finding the injunction in this case was improper.

16

Dombrowski, now, was a non-pending prosecution type case.

Because j

\

17
18

Prosecution was not pending.
In that case, as Cameron interprets it, it says that;

19

there will not be federal interference unless the statute is

20

excessively broad and vague and where you have the circumstances

21

as you had in Dombrowski, «hers the state courts had been

22
23

24
25

knocking down the search warrants, returning evidence, stopping
the state prosecution, and the officers would continue to
harass and prosecute under the statute.
If that is what Dombrowski means
9

and that is the only

'i

reason that a federal court can issue an injunction, a federal

2

three-judge court, then I am not at. all concerned,,

3

to have Dombrowski circumstances, where you have an excessively ;

4

broad and vague statute on its face and where you have the

S

special harassment circumstances, then I see no problem.

In this case I don't like the facts.

want to suggest mootness because 1 think one of the Dallas
criminal cases is still pending,

and I think there are some

cases pending in San Antonio and elsewhere around Texas.

Another problem that the court found below, or

to this.

15

that there will be a national, standard for the judging of

16

18
19

!

most of the problems in the obscenity field.

22
23
24
25

The only one it

neglects and doesn’t have in it is this prior adversary hearing,
the problem which has given the Court so much trouble.
First of all, I would like — I think the injunction

In this case I think tills obscenity case presents

below is improper, whether our statute is constitutional or
not.

I also say that the statute is constitutional and could

be constitutionally interpreted ~™~
Q

That is on the ground that 'there was a pending,

or there were, pending prosecutions.
13

i

A

So, sir, it is on the ground, that the Dorabrowski

2

circumstances were not present for the issuance of an

3

injunction either against pending or future prosecutions.

4

There were no circumstances present.

circumstances that could have been proved, that the court

In a way

11

I am asking this Court to, hopefully, really not dispose of the

case on the injunction aspect.

13

the Court will address itself to obscenity so that there will

14

be a definition of obscenity that will be approved of by a.

15

majority of the Court.

16

Q

I would be very hopeful that

But if the district court, was quite wrong in

17

interjecting itself, it would be quite wrong of us to continue

18

that interjection in the state court proceedings, wouldn't it.?

19

A

Well, sir, you have ——

20

Q

If you really roe an it in your argument that the

21

district court, -the three-judge district court, should».81 have

22

intervened, then, certainly, we shouldn't approve it.

23

24
25

Q

You would be asking us for an advisory opinion.

A

Your Honor, 1 am getting awfully close to it,

which everybody else has asked the Court not to do.

But I will

14

i

1

say that this Court,,, sis the final arbiter of law — in

2 : the obscenity field as in the tree®-judge field there is
3

hopeless confusion.

And I think this case presents the

4

necessary points to permit this Court to write in the obscenity

5

area without violating the purely advisory opinion — 1 am

6

getting awful close to it but —

7

Q

It depends on whose on is gorged.

8

A

That is true.

9

definition?

In this case we do need a

we need to know what community we need to prove

VO

obscenity by.

We need many other points decided, or we will

11

be in federal court forever.
Now as a supervisor of the federal system — we have

some 15 of these cases in Texas.

It is before you, it seems to me, to the extent

that this statute was relied upon by the Dallas police who

felt the statute gave them authority to make on-the-spot deter­

mination as to -the obscenity of any given material and

confiscate that material.

Q

But as I understand the three-judge court, it

wasn't dealing with the application of the statute to your

declared the statute constitutionally invalid on its face.

Isn't that the issue here?

although, naturally, the colorful facts of that are something

20

that you, as an advocate, want to tell as about.

A

Nothing to do with se&rch-and-seizur;

Understandably, I do, but let me at least say —

22

at least in colloquy with prior counsel and in earlier cases

24

of the Court that injunction should not be issued except in

that what we did? the relief we sought here? was clearly in a

contemplation of the declaratory judgment statute.

legislative history of the statute suggests that this is. part

22

of its purpose? that is to permit persons to go to federal

that the declaratory relief would have been ample relief for

practice is -that when -the issue is raised as to whether a three-

to designate a three-judge panel to decide, in the first
instance, whether or not. their action is required,

Hot in my view, no, Your Honor,

16

Q

Who raised the issue?

17

I was just trying to ferret it out of the

record.

with the record — is that the state raise it, perhaps not the

20

Attorney General, but we had the District Attorney and we had

the City Attorney in.

judge.

have no 2283 problems since we did not seek to enjoin pending

15

prosecutions.

18

and Judge Haynsworth and Baines? restraints upon future

18

our case really falls within that narrow area of comity or

19

■abstention, which .this Court has spoken, to in a number of

20

opinions.

21

As I understand this Court's opinion in Domtorowsk:

I guess most recently it seemed in Zwickler vs.

22

Koota? in which the Court said that the trial court in a case

23

such as this had the duty to look to the necessity of ceclar­

24
23

to ry relief independent of the determination as to injunctive
relief — and we think that in this instance the declaratory
27

1

relief was clearly proper under the governing decisions of

2

this Court.

3

We submit that this Court, when it said that wherever

4

the federal courts sit human rights under the Federal Consti­

5

tution are always a proper subject for adjudication, that this

6

was simply the kind of case we had.

7

were searches~and~seizures that were clearly reminiscent of

8

Stanford vs. Texas.

The human rights we had

If anything, they were worses

not one

10

that they intended to abandon this course of con evict; relying

11

upon a Texas statute that on its face was overbroad.

12

We would suggest that this case is actually sort of

13

a proof of the pudding in the sense of the necessity of a

14

principle akin to Donihrowski, or akin to other decisions of the

15

Court, and that is, facts that cry out for some relief, cry out

16

for some protection under the Federal Constitution, require the

17

immediate attention and cannot be allowed to languish while

!S

state criminal prosecutions — and -there has been no inhibition

19

against the state from prosecuting Mr. Stein.

20

almost -two years from the filing of the original prosecution,

21

.and they haven’t moved.

22

And we are now

This, we think — in keeping with my experience, at

23

least, while I practiced in Dallas — there were oft-times long

24

delays between the filing of a prosecution and its ultimate

25

disposition.

We found ourselves when we had to find action, and
28

3

we think the lower court order is quite proper.

2

The court's opinion addresses itself to obscenity,

3

not only on the ground that the statute punished mere possession,

4

but that it failed to contain -tine standard that appeared

did not contain that narrowing definition, and, hence, in. our

But it

It is a dialogue, a rhetoric, that is new, but,

Finally, in closing we would say that the Texas

21

statute — although the lower court failed to pass upon it —

22

there was an entirely alternative ground on which the statute

23

could have been stricken in our view; that is, the. statute's

24

wholly arbitrary exemption of daily and weekly newspapers.

25

My man, who could not have the money to get himself
29

1

out once a week,, hence,, fell under the statute because he

2

published twice a month, but yet, the statute wrote a broad

3

exemption for daily and weekly newspapers.

4

We think that inasmuch as we are in the area of what

5

are essentially fundamental rights of speech and press, that

6

the standard by which -this statute is to be judged is not. one

7

of whether it is arbitrary but rather whether this serves any

8

compelling state interest, that is, the exemption of daily

e

and weekly newspapers.

io

We suggest that there is no compelling

state interest to be served by that exemption.

That would provide an entirely alternative ground to

affirm 'die court’s action below, without addressing yourselves

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LONNY F. ZWIENER

I®

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19

MR. ZWIENER;

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

I would like to address myself for just a moment to

21

this exemption of newspapers.

As I said in the beginning,

22

whether the statute is unconstitutional or not, the injunction

23

was improper.

24

unwarranted and unjustified, but it was the best experience of

25

the legislature at -the time they passed this obscenity statute.

But this exemption is, I think is, perhaps,

30

1

Their experience was that newspapers did not publish pictures

2

of nude women and so forth, and they said, "Well, we'll exempt

3

newspapers, both daily and weekly."

4

ever thought of a newspaper published any other time.

I don't know that anybody

An a matter of fact, in the briefs below I briefed

5
8

the question fairly extensively, and a newspaper was something

7

that, apparently, is published either daily or weekly according

8

to the common parlance.
Tliis, I think, was what the legislature knew of

9
10

obscenity at the time.

This was a legislative judgment that

11

in the newspapers matters obscene did not appear.
The facts were discussed, and I might just expound

12

13

on that for a moment, on ray thought that

if these Dallas

14

police officers did engage in lawless conduct, ignoring the

15

statute and ignoring proper constitutional procedures, you

18

do not, in ray opinion, have a three-judge court case.

17

have a civil rights case, which might be handled by one judge.

18

It would not be a situation where you declared the statute

IS

unconstitutional.

You

There is some question in my mind whether an injunctior

20
21

could be issued in those cases.

22

would be as a civil rights complaint and

23

tormented by the police officers who are deliberately setting

24

out to suppress my civil rights."

25

here.
31

But certainly, the remedy
"I am being harassed,

We don't have that situation

In conclusion I again think that the facts of this

1
2

case merit an opinion by this Court on obscenity.,

I think

3

my preference would be if -the Court wrote Judge Harlan's view

4

taken in Roth where he expressed the point of view that the

5

states should be permitted to legislate in this area without

6

regard to a national standard* saying that one of -the geniuses

7

of the federal system is that we have some 48, at that time *

8

little laboratories where this type of experimentation

9

go on* and that he sees nothing that will be detrimental to

can

'

the country in permitting the states to experiment,

You don't think that: your urge to get some

12

clarification in -tills confused area might confuse the situation

13

even more?
A

14

15

Have you thought of that?
It might* Your Honor* but I don't know how it

could* really,

16

0

Well* that is possible,

17

What you would really like to haw» us do is

18

leave it to the states?
A

19

Tills would be my preference.

If not* I would

20

like a definition of obscenity from this Court* and if you

21

want to include "with no redeeming social value"* 1 think tills

22

is properly a defensive issue that a defendant could be expected

23
24
25

to prove.

If it is patently offensive and it appeals to the

prurient interest* tills should be enough to initiate
prosecution and let the defendant then show that there is
