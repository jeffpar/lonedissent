Our statutory post--conviction

There was a petition for certiorari from an ad­

verse determination there to our Court of Appeals of North
Carolina, which Is our intermediate Appellate Court for most
matters, but which is a Court of Final Appellate jurisdiction
for a post-conviction matter.
Again, there was an adverse determination and aga’.n,
a petition for certiorari was filed in this Court and, of
course was granted.
This esse has its beginnings in 1964.

This is a guilty plea and I suppose to purpose

is to ascertain whether the guilty plea is knowingly and

And then the purpose generally is for that and then

also, I suppose, insofar as the trial judge has discretion in
imposing sentence, to apprise him of the circumstances of the
offense so he can intelligently exercise his discretion; would
that, be true?

4

&

I think that9s true. Your Honor»

1 think some

of our judges accept the philosophy of Rule 11 to the effect

that -there should always be a basis in fact and plea and also

of course, it must be knowingly and voluntarily»

In this case, there was no discretion, as far

as — the trial court hkd no discretion as far as --

am X correct about that?

There was some colloquy between the Court and

the defendant and between the Court and the defendant’s mother

in which the Court did inquire into certain circumstances

of the defendant: his age, his educational background,

consent ox* implied consent or sort of an arrangement, which is
hidden by the background and has not been disclosed on the
facts of the case and I hope that there will be a new trial in
this case and I hope that at the new trial the defendant will
have a fair and full right to bring all these matters out to
the attention of the tryers of fact»
Also, some further brief background material on the

defendant.

There is a psychiatric evaluation of the Petition©:

in the record, indicating that he*s an unhibitivs and

impul­

sive individual and likely to act in such a way as to sectare
his immediate goals.
We submit in this case the immediate goal of the
defendant and the overwhelming goal that looms in front of him
6

1

2
3

is the avoidance of capital punishment, because of the strong
racial connections which this case had and. the times ~ the
spirit of the times in which this case was heard, brought up.

4

And we think that the record demonstrates that there

5

was a very substantial factor that was present.

6

theoretical basis for the <7ackson case, as I understand it is

7

this compulsion; this tendency to coerce people to render

8

involuntary pleas for them to give up their rights to trial by

9

jury and to plead not guilty? the right to have a full trial.

The whole

t

10

I realize that the actual fact of the Jackson case

11

and the precise holdingof the Jackson case go off in a dif­

12

ferent direction, as the Court pointed out a moment ago,

13

during Mrs. Bray's argument.

14

tical basis for the case is to provide some protection for a

15

person found in the position of the Petitioner in this case.

16

It seems to me the whole theore­

We say that the evidence on the record indicates

17

that there was substantial coercion present.

18

should be some test formulated by the Court in this case to

determine when and when not to extend Jackson protections to

an individual.

21

is not prepared to carve out a per se rule and to say that

22

every guilty plea to every capital offense heretofore in one

23

of those states or Federal jurisdiction where a Jackson-type

24

statute obtains, must be new set aside.

25

We say that there

We fully and candidly recognize that the Court

We do say, however, that some sort of test must be

7

1

devised by the Court to decide whan and when not to set aside

2

these judgments and convictions.

3

Q

Well, Cousnel, could you tell me whether in

4

any case where the death sentence is a possibility, is it

5

permitted, in your view, for the defendant to plead guilty to

6

some lesser offense?

7

have to exist to permit that?

8
9

A

What would be the conditions that would

Well, Your Honor, the facts in my case do not

involve any lesser offense, but 1 realise that the Court does

10

have that problem in this series of oases»

11

pleaded to the capital offense»

12

cussed this point in the footnote in the brief,

13

that where the lesser-included offense carries a sentence so

14

large that it is tantamount to life imprisonment that then the

15

matter should be considered on a parity with a guilty plea

16

carrying life imprisonment itself.

17

rule would extend to Mrs, Bray's case„

18

stopping point is. Your Honor,

19

other cases, the stopping point somewhere must ba arbitrary

20

and where this Court should place it, I cannot say,

21
22

24

25

My client here

I would say — 1 have dis­
I suggested

And thus, I hold that this
I don!t know where the

Like this case, as in many

I would say, however, thatmy client falls within the boundaries and pithia the limit for which we contend here,
.Q

And that's becuase ha entered his plea of

guilty as charged?
A

Yes, to the offense which ordinarily would be
8

1

capital were it not for the entering of the guilty plea.

2

Q

1 presume if there were a stopping place , there

3

would be a constitutional stopping place, wouldn’t it, the

4

decision cf this Court?

S

A

Well, since the Court is charged with finding

6

such a stopping place, Your Honor, I don't know where it would

7

be.

8

stopping point would be where you get a sentence which is

9

tantamount to life imprisonment, such as Henry Alford’s 30"

I suggested, as I say, in a footnote, that maybe the

10

year sentence.

Although, that’s not in my case and I really ayi

II

unable to say with certainty.

tz

I would think that the test that the Court should

13

invoke in these cases is something like the test devised in

14

Chapman versus California, carrying forward the realization

15

that in not every case would the guilty plea be set aside, but

16

only in those cases where the evidence made some showing that

17

the fear of the deafchhouse, fear of the gas chamber had an

18

effect ~ substantial effect.
Q

19

That would be every case, wouldn’t it?

Would

20

the fear of the deafchhouse always be a factor fehatwould

21

exert influence, if not coercion?
A

Well, 1 think one would have to say substantial

24

Q

How could it not?

25

A

I think it probably could be otherwise.

22
23

influence.

9

Could it be otherwise?

1

Q

Do you think -- do you see anything in the

2

constitution which either forbids

3

cast any doubt upon the whole idea of having guilty pleas

4

entered in criminal cases?

5

A

or tends to discourage or

No, Your Honor, 1 certainly am not attacking

6

the idea of allowing guilty pleas. I think you get into a

1

quagmire when you have a disparity in sentencing: one involving

8

life and the other involving death when you base a guilty plea

9

of that distinction. Fortunately, not every state has gotten

10

into that quagmire.

11

Federal jurisdiction, indicated frora footnotes contained in

12

our brief, and also footnotes or a portion of the amicus brief

13

by the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund,

There are -only some eight states and the

14

Also, on the basis of some rather sketchy statistics

15

which I have gathered, in the brief, which are on file with the

IS

court, it is indicated that perhaps the total number of

17

prisoners who would foe affected by a favorable decision for

18

my client in this case would not be an overwhelming number,

19

and that a great number of prisoners have served out almost as

20

many years as the average prisoner normally serves of a life

21

sentence before dying or being paroled or in someother way

22

terminating the service.

23
24

25

And that also, we’re not contending for a per se
rule but only provide new trial for those persons who would
show in some sway that the fear of the gas Chamber contributed
10

1

substantially to the guilty plea.

2
3

So that the argument may not be as persuasive in
this case as it would appear on first blusha

4

Q

Is your client out on bond or is he in jail?

5

A

Ho; he's been denied relief all along the way

6

and he is serving his life sentence.,

7

Also* in the present case we feel that when you

8

take the statutory construction* together with the coerced

9

confession which was obtained on the Petitioner* that these

ro

together make a rather potent showing of an invalidity of the

1!

guilty plea»

12

Escobedo Rule and subsequent to the pronouncement of the

13

Escobedo case and also we feel that the confession violated

14

the principles declared by this Court in Gallegos versus

13

Colorado,

16

The confession was clearly in violation of the

Considering the education limitations, the psycho­

17

logical deficit of the prisoner, the fact that the prisoner's

18

mother was kept from seeing him during the night on which the

19

confession was obtained; his isolation and the denial of

20

drinking water and other matters which are . brought out in the

21

record and which are not overcome by any adverse evidence..

22

Even giving the state the benefit of all its favorable testi­

23

mony, we feel quits clearly that under constitutional standards

24

drawn by this Court there was a coerced confession.,

23

Q

Is the United States against Jackson argument
11

1
. 2

really just a part of a coerced confession argument?

Or do

you think it’s an additional or different argument?

3

A

I think the two go forward together and both

taint the plea.

5

weight to tie Jackson confirraifcy which was present in this

6

case.

7

where there is a Jackson defect in the statutes, 1 don't know.

8

I would suggest, though, that because of this additional

9

problem relating to the voluntariness of the confession, -the

We feel that this coerced confession adds

How far the Court should go in allowing new trials

10

Court would be justified, certainly in setting this guilty

II

ple-a aside.

12

Q

So, you think in this case your plan is that

13

the guilty plea resulted from a combination of things, all

14

bad:

15

North Carolina which was coercive upon a person to plead

16

guilty; is that right?

17

A

That's right, sir.

18

Q

A combination of both,

19

A

(a) a coerced confession and (b) the statutory scheme of

And we have another aspect, to this case which

20

I want to bring briefly to the Court's attention if I may.

21

That is a completely unrelated matter, but certiorari was

22

generally granted in this case so I assume that the Court is

23

interested in it and this was a point concerning the system™

24

atic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury which indicted

23

the Petitioner.

Of course, he never came to trial so the
12

i

trial jury is not in question here»

a

Quite clearly the statistics in this case show that

the Petitioner comes within that long line of cases decided ,by

4

the Court on the permissible limits of racial exclusion of

5

grand jurors of providing he did not waive his right to attack

North Carolina and I might add the Fifth Circuit"under the
