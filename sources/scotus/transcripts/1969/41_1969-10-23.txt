MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed, Mr.

Claiborne, whenever you are ready.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

S

OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. CLAIBORNE;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8

the Court:

Yesterday I had said that the conveyances to these

9

two tribes, the Cherokees and the Choctaws, taken together,

10

encompassed the river bed of the Arkansas River.

In or>

n

stance the river bed or the river was entirely surrounded by

12

Cherokee land and you find the other portion in dispute was the

13

boundary between the territories joining those two tribes.

14

As to that latter portion, it is suggested that

15

somehow the bed of the Arkansas River was included in neither

m

grant, is somewhat comparable: to what might be a suggestion wher

17

say, the States of Louisiana and Mississippi were admitted to

18

the Union where the Mississippi River is the boundary between

19

them, and because of the Acts of Admission in each case read

20

"through the river," or "down the river,'8 or "down the main

21

channel of the river,” as these conveyances do, the conclusion

22

reached would be that the Mississippi River ware included neithe c

23

in Mississippi nor in Louisiana, a result which we would strain

24

to avoid because it obviously makes no sense.

25

comparable to the 'situation here.

3

That is quite

We're not dealing with grants; small grants to

i

2

private landowners, we are dealing with what amounts to large

3

territories ceded to quasi-sovereign tribes, then defined as

4

nations; in that time considered quasi-independent.

5

treaties that we — the fact that we dealt with them by treaties

6

of course, indicates that approach of dealing with Indian

7

tribes as independent entities.

The

•?

The treaties themselves recognised extensive powers

8
9

of self-government in these tribes.

It would be inconsistent

10

with that approach to attempt to reserve, to wish to reserve,

n
iz

to have an interest in reserving the beds of navigable rivers
or any other territory within the area ceded, except only as

13

the United States might have some special reason for doing so.

14

Such as maintaining the area around Fort Gibson in the middle

15

of the Cherokee grant, which was expressly done.
So, here there may have been interests in the United

16
17

IS
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

States in reserving a right of navigation on the Arkansas River
and thatcan be read into these grants, to the Choctaws and
k

Cherokees*

But of course, the navigational servitude which

as pertains tothe United States in all states, does not carry
with it an ownership of the bed of the river and there is no
reason to so read it here.
Q

Excusa me.

Is there any indication here that

the bed of this river has any particular value by reason of
any minerals or anything imposited in it?

4

1

A

Precisely, Mr. Justice Black.

At that time it

2

was not known that the bed of this river would become valuable

3

and there was, therefore, no reason for the United States to

4

withhold, for its own benefit, the bed of this river.

5

was concerned about — all it could be concerned about was to

6

reserve its rights to maintain it as an open highway of

7

commerce and as a way of access to Fort Gibson within the

8

Indian territory.

9

the United States to wish to

10

Q

All it

But, as to the bed, there was no reason for

YOU didnt* quite understand my question.

Is

II

there anything in the record that indicates that the bed of

n

this stream, as such, has embodied in it any minerals of any

13

type that make it of any special value.

U

A

Today, yes, Mr. Justice

15

Q

What is it?

16

A

It's oil.

17

Q

Oil.

18

19
20

21

22
23
24

25

A

Black.

And this controversy arises because very

valuable oil deposits have been discovered in the bed of the
river and so the matter becomes an important tactical dispute.
Q

Is the real pragmaticquestion, then, who owns

the oil there, the Indians or the State of Oklahoma?
A

That is exactly the practical question, Mr.

Justice Black„
Now, as to the Equal Footing Doctrine, we say that

First, we point out that it

1

doctrine has no application hera»

6,

hadn’t been invented yet.

3

case in this Court to apply that rule — a lawful, inevitable

4

rule, was seven after these grants to these Indian tribes.

5

Now, 1 —

6

Q

Part of this is

— in the first

Before you go on, I wanted to ask:

Did the

7

Unitad States take the position that the Arkansas was then or

8

is not now — X guess then — was not then navigable above

9

Fort Gibson?

Yesterday you said we were talking about the

10

navigable portion of the Arkansas River.

Now, I suppose there

a

are Indian lands bordering the Arkansas Fiver above Fort

12

Gibson?

13

A

Yes, there certainly were.

14

Q

And there still are?

15

A

1 think so, Mr. Justice White, but there could

Q

Not these, but some others?

A

They certainly were Cherokee and Creek lands

!6
17
J8

19

be.

bordering on the portion of the

20

Q

Are they stili there?

21

A

I really am not aware of it.

22

Q

Well, in any event, in this we. would be

23
24
25

settling the question for any of the navigable portion of the
Arkansas in this case.
A

That is what X think, too, Mr. Justice White.

1

I thought it. was agreed by ail parties and I may be mistaken

2

that the navigable course of the Arkansas River ends at Port

3

Gibson»

4

Q

Has that ever been litigated?

C

A

lt frankly, cannot answer.

6

7
8
9

Perhaps one of the

other Counsel will know that.
Q

What difference does it make, from the point of

view in this case, whether it is navigable or not navigable?
A

It's the only claim Oklahoma can make to the bed

10

of the river — only on the supposition that it was never

11

included in any grant to any Indian, in w'hf c& event it still

12

belongs to the United States» or still did at the time of

13

I'm not sure, it may still then belong to the United States,

14

never having been ceded to the state expressly.

15

Q

In your submission yesterday you. posed, at least

16

as I understood it, the Indian tribes gave up the real good

17

land in Georgia and South Carolina in the Eastern States in

IS

exchange for this land.

19

of every character to subsurface minerals, oils, in those

.20

eastern lands; is that correct?

21
22

23
24
25

A

I suppose they surrendered all rights

I think that is true, Mr. Chief Justice.

I am

not clear whether those prior grants were as categorically
feasible grants.

I am clear that those-grants were not made

with the stipulation, which is quite relevant here, the present
lands would never, under any circumstances, be incorporated

7

within a state and that they were granted in perpetuity as a

1

permanent home.

2

This language being appropriate precisely

because these tribes have left and shifted westward that it was

3

appropriate to„ at long last, seemed to be guaranteeing them a

4

place from which they would not be evicted.

5

Though, in the

end they were evicted from Oklahoma, as well.

6

As I say, the Equal Footing Doctrine is inappropriate

7
here.

8

First, it hadn’t been devised yet and therefore, could

hardly be supposed to have been in the minds of the grant

9

office, but mostly because that is a doctrine which is — works

10

for -.he benefit of a future state.

Here we have an expressed

11
declaration in both treaties to the effect that never will a

12

state? be created in this territory and therefore no occasion

13
to reserve the benefits of future states that, will never come

14

into existence, the beds of navigable rivers.

For these

IS
reasons we suggest —

IS

Q

May I ask you one question for information?

17
If the Indians are awarded this land, how will the oil be of

18
benefit to them?

Will they own it in common or the tribe and

19
if it has to foe exported, how will it foe done?

Who will control

20
it?

Can they do it themselves?

2?
A

22

Mr. Justice Black, as to your first question,

,

the Tribe retains in existence and does now have tribal

23
property as opposed to the formal property which has bean sub­

24
divided among the individual Indians.

25
8

There is a Tribal Council

1

there is a Tribal Government; there are Tribal funds which are

2

administered for the common benefit of the tribe., seme of those

3

for school purposes.
What would happen and how the Indians would choose

4

to appropriate the revenues from, these oil lands, I am not

5

clear.

6

It might be that the — technically the property would

lie in trust with the United States — that some supervision

7
8

of these revenues would lie with the Department of the Interior,
That Question, frankly, hasn't been fully explored and I am not

9
10

sure how it would result.

n
12

Q

You say it goes for the schools; what schools?

A

There are, as I understand it, Cherokee and

.

13
14

Choctaw schools maintained with Tribal funds derived from other
common tribal, property..
Q

15
16

They run their own schools still, in that

section of the country?
A

As I understand it, they do; some of them

17
18
19
20

attend the state schools.

They are free to do either.

But they

do use some of the tribal funds for that purpose, so I am
advised»
Q

But not for their entire educational system fron

21

22

fisst grade through high school, isn't that so?
A

I think that is correct, Mr. Justice White; it

23
is not for the whole.educational system.

Q

A

What portion is that?
The portion selected by the Cherokees in

The historical evidence is that there are a.

few miles of the Arkansas and few miles of the Verdigris .that

are navigable and would foe legally so, but the Cherokees didn't

choose to include that in this suit, so we have not treated

This stretch of the river is a meandering stream, as

! you will see on that map.

Although it has not been pertinent

13

in this case and no evidence has been introduced on it., our

14

engineer estimates that there are a little over a hundred miles

IS

of river bed in this stretch of the river.
You will note at the head of this stretch, Fort

16

Gibson, established in 1824 anci at the foot of it, Fort Smith

17

18

on which the first military establishment appeared in 18.17 „

19

This area had been substantially used in commerce during this

20

decade previous to the time of the signing of these final

j

treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws.

21

Let us keep these

dates in mind.

22

The first treaty that the Eastern Cherokeas signed

23

and they constituted, I believe, about four-fifths of the entire

24

tribe

25

i
s

— was in 1835»

All treaties previous to that and then

11

1

negotiated with the Western Cherokees, who, 1 believe, con-

2

sfcituted only about one-fifth of the Cherokee numbers„

3

were a group that separated from the rest and went out west

4

voluntarily and the rest didn't want to and negotiated over

5

many years and finally arrived at an agreement in 1835.,

They

7

ceded all previous treaties and the one upon which the Choctaw

claims and the patent is based, was executed in 1830,

The trial court said;

November 16, 1907,(the day of Oklahoma statehood), the Arkansas
River, in its natural state was a navigable river below its
confluence with the Grand River,

.regularly used throughout the

remainder of its course inwhat is now Oklahoma

as a highway

in fact, it has been leasing them since about 1908.

Has there been any litigation about it before?

Mr. Claiborn,

I believe, vrak mistaken on that subject; I am sure he was in

There is some gas production.

Well, who is this controversy really between.?

A

The controversy is between the State of

Oklahoma and ’the Cherokee Tri.be and the Choctaw.

Q

15

I know that's what it appears, but. who is it

actually between?

16

A

17

Could I say this, Mr. Justice Black?

The

values of the land involved far exceed the value of the minerals

18

And there is no claim by any other respondent to

19

lands other

than the State.

Q

2!

Your claim is that -the State of Oklahoma.7 was

given the bed of the stream when it became a state and it has

How, is there, at the end of this lawsuitr &

controversy between the various oil companies as to whether the

There is no controversy there, Mr. Justice

There is no controversy between the state and

any oil and gas —

10

X'm not talking about between the state.

Are

11

three two groups of oil companies and at the end of this are

they going to have a fight over which one gets it, depending

13

upon whether it goes to the Indians or the State?

14

A

Wo? there is not,

15

Q

Well, what are all these oil companies whose

16

names are signed to your brief *— why are they interested?
A

Because they own oil and gas - leases from the

From the state?

Wot from the Indians? that is correct.

Well, they are bound to have to fight that out

And not from the Indians?

at the end, aren’t they?
A

Wo; not if the State of Oklahoma prevails, they

have good leases.

That's right? but suppose the State of Oklahoma

does not prevail?

The law is and we have set it forth in our

Oklahoma as being the extent of the State’s claims to the bed

which oil companies will get leases;

Mr. Justice Black, perhaps that could be

assumed, but it is not a fact.

About 25, it looks like to me.

23

A

Well, I say one ■— you will find one company

24

that will have only on© lease on one, say a 320 acre tract, which

25

encompasses a part of the riverbed.

But we have 100 miles of

Are you representing the Indians?

It looked a lot better when the. suit

When did it actually start between the Indians?

The Indians brought the suit in December, 1966,

over this river for 60 years?

But you didn’t use it prior to that?

A

Yes? we did.

7

But I understood you to say that in the past

four years there had been a big jump in the gas business.
A

8
9

We executed many gas leases and —

In the last four years there has been a dis­

covery of gas; yes? a gas field over here —•

10

That’s when the Indians decided they were

interested in the land?

That's right.

That got'them interested and

They had stood

Well, what value is the river bed to the

State of Oklahoma, other than for mineral production?
A

18

The riverbed encompasses, within the highwater

20

stantial .

21

22
23
24
25

Q

For what?

A

Agriculture.

These riverbottom lands where the

river is now being controlled through 'he navigation project,
are very valuable lands,• They can be smoothed over with a

Any other use except agriculture?

Q

Leaving that out.

A

Probably the new navigation channel makes

certain areas along the riverbed valuable for industrial -plants
15
16

or any number of things, but -the navigation project, plus the
gas development probably had something to do with the Indians

17

deciding in 1956 to file their suit.

Is there anything in this record showing the

I call attention to what the Court of Appeals said:

7
8
S
10

nThe Indians seek comfort from the technical language of the
treaties and grants.

They attach significance to such phrases

as "to the Arkansas River and down the Arkansas and thence
down the main channel of the Arkansas.

11

17

20

We agree with

Oklahoma, that references to the Arkansas reiver are for the
monuments
purpose of establishing reference points,
or boun­
daries .

They donot indicate an intent, much less a clear

intent to convey the river bed."
Now, that was the conclusion of the Court of
Appeals in passing on these treatied and patents that 1 have
recently referred to.
Q

What about the point that if you read the

Cherokee patent, the Cherokee, lands straddle the Arkansas?

The answer to that is that, there was no clear,

14

or the patents referring to that portion or any portion of the

15

Arkansas River bed; that under the authorities set forth in

the decisions, starting back with Martin versus Waddell,

12

13

for 60 years»

certain reservations were established for the Chippewa Indian
Tribe.

Under certain treaties made prior to Minnesota state­

17

hood, these treaties expressly described certain land as being

13

reserved for these Indians.

19

contrary to what Counsel for the Cherckees and Choctaws have

20

argued.

They do create a reservation,

The statute shows this.
Now, in the Red Lake Indian reservation, within the

21

22

boundaries of that reservation was a lake called "Mud Lake."

23

That — in 1889 — the last treaties were in 1855, prior to

24

Minnesota statehood -- the state being admitted in .1858, I

25

believe.

The Treaty of 1855 included this Mud Lake.

■*» < v

And in

1

18#9 the Government made a further treaty with the Indians, in

2

which the Red Lake Reservavion was to be ceded back to the

3

Government and was ceded back to .the Government.

4

then was going to divide the land into tracts and sell it off

5

and deposit the money in a trust fund for the benefits of the

Chippewas«

The Government

A number of tracts -were sold to settlers by the

Government, and patents issued to the purchasers, alone the

9

shores of Mud Lake.
Later on the. Government developed a project to drain

10

SI

mud lake and that lay bar® certain valuable agricultural land

12

between the riparian lines of the settlers who had bought the

13

land from the Government and the water ~ the place to where the

14

water had receded.

15

under the Minnesota law.

And they claimed, as riparian proprietors

The Federal Government sued on behalf of the

16
17

Chippewas, contending that this lake was not a navigable lake

18

and not being a navigable lake, when the water was drained away,

19

the land laid bare did not inure to the benefit of the riparian

20

proprietors, but they claim it did inure to the benefit of the

21

Chippewas.

22

And there was no question of that.

23
24
25

It was within the Red Lake Reservation boundaries.

The Court hSid, in s&btefefence, that in the treaty
with the Chippewas, which did expressly encompass this area
within the boundaries, the United States did not expressly and

\

distinctly convey the navigable water bottoms.

2

by the way» that the land — that the bottoms were navigable»

3

contrary to the United States — the lake was navigable# con­

4

trary to the contention of the united States.

5

They first hala»

And# accordingly# the Court halo sincethere was no

6

specific description of this land encompassed all around by the

7

reservation boundaries ?. that there could not ba inferred any

8

intention to convey the navigable water bottoms in view of the

9

long-established policy of this Gauntry to hold the beds of

10

11
1(2

navigable waters in trust for future states.
Now# that# in substance# is the holding in the Holt
State Bank and we think it's the holding under which the part

13

— the Arkansas River that has Cherokee land on both sides

14

should continue to be owned and held by the State of Oklahoma.

15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Now# the argument of counsel for the other side#
seems to be based principally on the agreement in the Cherokee
treaty that the lands ceded to them should not# at any future
time# be embraced within the boundaries of a future statee
without their consent.

Remember that# without their consent.

The Choctaw Treaty says that the lands ceded to them
should# at no time be included within the boundaries of a
future territory or state.

Now. in 1893» by Act of Congress

of March 18# 1893 27 atat.645.

Congress created a commission

for the purpose of inducing the Cherokees and Choctaws and other
tribes to relinquish tribal rights and to accept allotment of

a «i

1

their lands in severalty to tribal members,for the ultimate

2

object of including said lands in a state.
The result of this Act and in ensuing Acts of

3
4

Congress* were agreements with the Cherokees.

5

with the Choctaws* 30 stat.495, 32 stat.641, in 1902,. which

6

provide for the allotment of the lands to individual members

7

32 stair716 and

of the respective tribes and relinquishment of the general

8

powers of the tribal government.

These agreements were followec

9

by the Act of April 28* 1904* 3 stat.573* which supplanted

10

the Tribal Laws and put the laws of Arkansas* in effect* in

1?

Indian territory.

iz

Q

That part of Indian territory.

13

A

Yes; that is correct.

14

Now* in 1901 an Act of Congress was passed making

15

all members of the five civilized tribes, including Cherokees

16

and Choctaws and Chicasaws* making them citizens of the United

17

States.

How* in the Acts of April 26* 1906* continued tribal

22

The Interior Department was given complete and
comprehensive regulationover the tribes.

The Cherokees and

Choctaws became citizens of the United States as a result of
these Congressional Acts and as citizens of the territory* they
voted with other citizens in he elections concerned with the

Now, the tribes continued to exist in a sort of

de jure form.

They had practically everything — there was very

little that their tribal governments have to decide.
