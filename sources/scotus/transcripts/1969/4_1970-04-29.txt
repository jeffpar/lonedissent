ARGUMENT OF ALBERT W. HARRIS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. HARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court;

9

This is an appeal from an order of a three™judge court

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

in the Central District in California, declaring the California
Criminal Syndicalism Act was unconstitutional on its face and in
all of its parts z>n& enjoining the District Attorney of the
Los Angeles County from enforcing and continuing with the prose­
cution of a man named John Harris, Jr., who was one of the
plaintiffs in this case.
The appeal is by the District Attorney and represented
here by the Attorney General of the State of California.
The complaint in the District Court was filed by John

19

Harris, Jr., following his indictment on two counts of violating

20

subsection (3} of Syndicalism Act.

21

by reason of his prosecution and the presence of the act, he was

22

inhibited in the exercise of his First Amendment Rights.

He claimed in the complaint

There

23

were three other plaintiffs enjoined in the lawsuit:

24

and Hirsch both alleged that they were members of the Progressive

25

Jim Dan

Party, a party that advocated political and industrial change,
2
i

1

aid they felt inhibited in attempting through peaceful nonviolen

2

means to advocate Progressive Labor programs in light of the

3

presence of this statute and. the prosecution of John Harris,
The fourth plaintiff was a man named Broslawsky, who

4
5

alleged that he was a teacher of history and he taught subjects

3

in which Marxism was involved and he was uncertain what he could

7

say about these matters by reason of the presence of the act

8

on the books and by reason of the prosecution of John Harris,

9

Q

Where did he teach these subjects?

Well, it is all contained in about one paragraph

in the complaint and that is all we knew about it.

Q

What is all we know. Thank you.

A

The plaintiffs allege that there was irreparable

injury.

19

claim except the conclusion that they felt inhibited and were

20

prevented from exercising fundamental constitutional rights.

21

They allege no specific facts in support of this

The District Court held that it had jurisdiction to

22

pass on all phases of the Act, not only the section vnder which

23

John Harris was prosecuted.

The District

Court went, to hold the Act unconstitutional on its face in all
3

1

its provisions with no mention whatever of any California case

2

that had construed any of ahe sections of the Act.

3

Finally, the Court issued an injunction against the

4

pending prosecution of John Harris.

5

that the District Court had no jurisdiction whatever in respect

to the claims of Dan,, Hirsch, and Broslawsky.

Those were the

Q

Was any threat made against them?

A

There was no such allegations tour Honor, in the

complaint and, in fact, the District Court said in the opinion
that it did not believe that the plaintiff stcdd in any danger
whatever of prosecution for the conduct that they had alleged
that they had engaged in,,
In addition, in connection with the jurisdictional
question, we contend that the Court had no jurisdiction to pass

15
on any provision except Section 3, the section under which
1G
John Harris was charged and upon which he was awaiting trial.
17
18
19

£0

Secondly, as to Section 3 the District Court should
have abstained.
Third, on the merits we submit that the Act is valid

21

in the light of the narrowing state constructions in a number

22

of state cases that we have cited in our brief.

23

Finally, all other things failing, we submit an injunc

24

tion was barred under Section 2233 of Federal 28 and that there

25

was no irreparable injury in support of the injunctive relief.
4

The first point in connection with the lack of juris-

1
2

diction in respect to the three plaintiffs other than John Harris

O
«u*‘

is basically on the proposition that there was no overt acts by

4

the state of California or representative of the state that migh;

5

be construed in any way to have inhibited these plaintiffs in

6

the exercise of Federal constitutional rights.

7

no arrests, there have been no threat of arrests, no searches,

0

no denunciations of these plaintiffs.

There have been

The only claim that they can make is that the mere

9
10

presence of the Act is sufficient to create a case for contro­

11

versy.

12

circumstances here that the action of the District Court amounted

13

to an advisory opinion on an abstract question.

We submit that it is not and we submit that under the
i

14

The facts as set forth in the complaint in connection

15

with these three plaintiffs who were not charged do not show any

1G

substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal

17

interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the

18

declaratory relief and to give rise to a case for controversy.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

We rely principally in that connection upon, your deci­
sion in the last term in Golden against Zwicker, where you dis­
missed the case because there was no case for controversy even
though having included the statute was arguably over-broad and
affecting rights under the Fifth Amendment.
Q

Did an injunction actually issue against the

state prosecution of Harris?
5

1

A

Yes , it did , Your Honor.,

2

Q

And that has been existing all the way through?

3

A

For four years or thereabouts, Your Honor.

4

In connection with Harris himself, we wouldn't argue

5

that there is only an abstract question.

6

and if the trial is ever held, he could possibly be convicted.

7

But he is only charged under Section 3 of the Act.
We submit that the District Court had no jurisdiction

0
9
50
11
12

to reach to other sections of the Act.

15

16
17

and declare them illegal under the general definition of of
"criminal syndicalism" contained in Section 11400.
The Legislature provided in connection with this Act
that if any portion of it, for example, Section 3, which relates
to the distributing of handbills and the like, printing matters
and things of that kind, any part should be held unconstitutional
and the rest remaining portions should be sustained.
We have argued in our brief that in the Smith Act

IS
19

20
21

There are five sections

in Section 11401 that deal with different forms of conduct

13
14

cases and the Smith Act had a structure very similar to this
with a membership provision, with a printing or distributing
section.

In those cases this Court took each section and axarain ; d

22

that section and declined to pass on the other sections? only

23

the section -chat was specifically involved and had been invoked

24

against the particular defendants in the Dennis Case, in the

25

Yates Case and in. the Scales Case.
6

We think that one of the problems in this case is

e?

a

that the District Court in passing upon sections of the Act that
3

had not been invoked,, sections of the Act as to which there was

4

no actual controversy.

clause provision.

10

i»
12

13

It. prohibits organizing, it prohibits know­

ingly becoming a member of a criminal syndicalist organization,
as defined therein.

This was struck down by the District Court.

Harris was not prosecuted under this section.

8
9

For example, Section 4 is a membership

There

was no intention by the District Attorney, nor has there been
any contention by anyone in California, that the group to which
Harris belongs, the Progressive Labor Party, I believe, is a
proscribed organization and that belonging to it constitutes any
crime,
In short, there was no actual controversy on that ques

14

19

tion and we think one of the problems may be — when you donst

10

have an actual controversy, and this case may illustrate that,

17

18

is that there is not an informed judgment passed by the District
Court.

19

The pertinent cases, and we have cited some of the

20

cases, apparently were never considered by the Court, and we

21

think this was due probably because the District Attorney was

22

not interested in the membership clause, he was not prosecuted,

23

Harris had not been charged under the membership clause and he

24

was only interested .in an abstract way in the validity of that

25

section.

In the first place, this law was susceptible of a

narrowing interpretation that would by revolving vagueness in

terms of the statute, cure an^ problem of overbreadth, and thus

22

we submit that there was a reasonable expectation there would

A

2

Yes, Your Honor, that is from the Black Panther

2

paper in San Francisco.

That has nothing to do with the facts

4

of this particular case.

Those are illustrative of the condi-

S

tions that we submitted at that time and warranted the upholding

6

of this Act.
In connection with the question of abstention, we say

7

a

that the state law can be saved.

And if can be saved, it will

9

avoid a constitutional decision by the Federal Court., be it the

m

District Court of this Court, and that is one of the purposes

If

of the doctrine.
There is a pending vehicle in the indictment of John

12

13

Harris and the, if he is ever tried, trial and his appeal.

14

Finally, there is no evidence whatever, nor is it even

15

claimed that there has been bad faith enforcements of the statute

10

for the purpose of denying the people of California their Federa.

17

constitutional rights.

There is a contention that many years

9ft
SO

ago this may have occurred, but there is no contention that at

19

or about the time this case was filed and decided in Los Angeles

29

there was any bad faith enforcement, of the Act.
We say that this Act is susceptible to a clarifying

21

22

and a narrowing construction for a number of reasons.

23

all, there have been a number of cases in California that have

24

passed on various provisions of the Act since it was enacted in

25

1919.

and 1924,, and there has been very little — only this case having

Excuse me, Mr. Harris.

something that was an appendix or a supplementary brief in the

argument and reply thereto.

Thank you.

13

A

It was filed by the appellees, not by the appella it

14

Q

I don“t have it either.

15

A

The decision over 20 years ago in the Danskin.

16

case by Justice Trainer made it very clear that in view of the

17

California Supreme Court, the California Criminal Syndicalism

18

Act couldn5t be evaluated simply on its face and in its own

19

terms.

20

Court in the area of the First Amendment.

21

Trainer said that the Act should only be applied to prohibit,

22

conduct where there was imminent danger that advocacy will give

23

rise to the evils that the state may properly prevent.

24
25

It had to be evaluated in light of decisions by this
In fact, Justice

That is language that is very remiscent and is very
close to the language used by this Court in the Brandenburg case

11

1

last terra when you struck down the Ohio Syndicalism Law on the

2

ground that it was not limited to speech or advocacy directed

3

to and eliciting violent action, and it contained no condition

4

that such actions are likely under the circumstances.
We submit that a fair reading of Danskin gives a very-

S
0

close parallel with your decision in Brandenburg, and you can

7

reasonably anticipate the California Supreme Court, if it sus- -

G

tains the law, would sustain it under that kind of a clarifying

9

and narrowing construction.
Now, in connection with Section, itself,, the so-called

10

n
12
13
14

15

"circulating or distributing section/* in the Malley case —
People against Malley, which is cited in our briefs — the Suace
Court many years ago and in anticipation of many of the doctrine s
that have developed, held that to prosecute and convict a person
under this section, it had to be proven that he understood the

1G

doctrine in the material, in the handbills that he was handing

17

out, that he wasn't just oat there handing out. something because

18

somebody told him to.
He had to understand it and he had to intend to bring

19

20

about the consequences, that is, the unlawful acts, the unlawful

21

means, terroristic means, that, are proscribed under the statute.

22

He had to have an intent himself to do that.

23

there had to be a clear and present danger of such unlawful act

24

occurring.

25

And in addition

This is very close, we submit, to what the decisions
12

:

1

of this Court have held in the intervening years in the Dennis

2

casaf and in many other cases.

3

Looking to New York, to anticipate State Court action

4

in the Epton case..,

5

a narrow construction.

6

The criminal anarchy statute there was given

Looking to the decisions of this Court in this field,

7

the Smith Act cases all gave a clarifying and narrowing con­

3

struction to those sections, the Dennis, Yates and Scales deci­

9

sions, and each of those cases finds its parallel in one the

10

1!

provisions in the Criminal Syndicalism Act.
This is not a case such as Baggett — in the Baggett

12

case, the Zwickler case, Zwickler against Koota, where the Court

13

felt that there was no chance that this statute could be saved,

14

that it affected expression, but it could not be saved by a

15

narrowing construction.

1G

In fact, we think this is a classic example of the

17

other extreme, a case that can and, I would say, in speaking of

18

the probabilities, which I supposed we are concerned with in

19

this issue, the odds are certainly very heavy that this statute

20

can be saved and that it would be saved by the California Courts

21

if ever presented to them.

22

Now, there is a case at the moment.

That is the prose­

23

cution of John Harris.

24

has an absolute right to appeal his conviction and the validity

25

If he is found guilty and sentenced, ha

of his conviction .
13

1

Q

Mr, Harris, X don't seem fco have that indictment

2

here.

3

doesn't seam to have it either.

4

form of the indictment

X don't have that appendix or whatever it is.
You have it there.

The Clerk
What is the

in relation to the statute?

S

A

Well, the indictment is a typical indictment in

6

California.

California indictments are in the language of the

1

statute.

0

Q

In the language of the statute?

9

A

Pardon me?

10

Q

In the language of the statute?

11

A

In the language of the statute.

12

Q

13

And does that say, then, that subsection (3) is

reprinted in the indictment?
A

14

Well, not reprinted, but he is charged with having

15

— accused of having violated this particular statute, 114011.3)

IS

of the Penal Code, and it goes on to say that on or about the

17

certain date he did wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously issue

18

and circulate and so forth certain papers and forms that contained

IS

written and printed advocacy of, in effect, criminal syndicalism

20

advocating terrorism and advising the commission of crime, et

21

22
23
24
25

cetera.
It is rather lengthy because the statute icself is
rather lengthy.

And, in addition, attached fee the indictment

is the specific handbill that he handed out or. each occasion.
Q

And that is the Clerk's room now, I hope.
14

Thank

i

you.

2

How what page is the indictment?

3

A

The indictment starts at page 3 of this appendix

4

and it runs for quite a. number of pages because there were two

5

different days,, two different handbills and two different counts

6

in this indictment.
The indictment should be read in light, of the Californ 2
<

7
G

procedure wherein the defendant had made available to him the

9

Grand Jury transcript automatically without any questions asked,

10
1?

12

.

so that to charge himsimply in the language of the statute
doesn't prejudice him.

He can find exactly what the evidence

was and pinpoint the charge,
Q

13

At what stage is this first opportunity to get

14

this limited as you have suggested that the California Court wouJ d

13

limit it?

1G
17
IS

A

Yes.

Q

That is clear and present, danger and eio forth.

A

We submit, Your Honor, that under the standard

19

California procedure the first opportunity in the trial court

£0

would be when instructions are given to the jury.

21

Now the question might arise in connection with evi­

22

dence as it is offered, but by and large it would be, 1 think,

23
24
25

the elements would be set forth in the instructions to the jury,
the things the jury has to find in order to convict this man.
Now, it has been contended here that Harris moved under

15

I

935 of the Penal Code to dismiss the indictment.

2

was denied.

That motion

3

He demurred to the indictment on the ground that the

4

statute upon which the indictment was founded was wrong on its

S
0

7

face.

The demurrer was denied.

The motion under 995 was denied:

Now those are simply trial court rulings.
Harris then applied to the District Court of Appeals

8

under Section 99S (a} of the Penal Code,,

9

California procedure.

Now, this is a special

Under 995 you can attack an indictment

10

on the ground either that the indictment either was unlawfully

11

returned, some error occurred in the process, or on the ground

12

of not probable cause to hold the defendant to answer.

13
14

IS

That turns on the evidence before the Grand Jury.

It

is an evidentiary issue.
Now, if this is denied, California has a special statu­

16

tory procedure, 999(a), and I don5fc know of anything similar

17

in Federal practice -- it is a very good provision — whereby

10

you can go to the appellate court, the intermediate appellate

19

court, and ask for a writ of prohibition under this section on

20

the ground that you are being held without probable cause and

21

that you shouldn't be put to all the trouble of trial.

22
23

999 (a) , however,, is limited to this issue, whether or
not the defendant is being held without probable cause.

24

Q

25

Grand Jury?

You say that is in Texas with reference to the

16

I

A

Yes,, that is correct. Your Honor,

2

That is the only issue that may properly be raised

3

with this special statutory section.

4

or not the statute is itself valid on its face and similar ques­

5

tions cannot be raised at that point.
This is simply to determine whether the man should bs

6
i

for trial,
Q

0
9
10

Now. the question of whether

Suppose there was nothing whatever in the Grand

Jury testimony which satisfied the ingredient of clear and present
danger and so forth, then what would happen?
A

n

Wall, I think you con51 have any precedent as to

12

precisely what would happen under those circumstances, Your Honor,,

13

but I think clear and present danger is one of those elements

14

that would be tested at the trial as opposed to Grand Jury indict­

15

ment ,

10
17
18

The Grand Jury indictment is just te put the man to
trial, not to convict him.

And there is evidence in this tran­

script which would indicate the clear and present danger, but 1

19

don't think that under our procedure it is called for at that

20

particular time.

21

Wow, it has been argued that the application for

ARGUMENT OF A. L. WIRIN, ESQ.

*30

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

aci>

ID
20
21

Very well, Mr. Harris.

MR. WIRIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The ultimate question, as we view it, is whether or

22

not the California Criminal Syndicalism Act is unconstitutional

23

as violating the First Amendment and whether the District Court

24

in so ruling was correct.

25

tion was reached, there is concededly a serious threshold

But long before that ultimate ques­

19

1

question,, and we the appelless, and particularly appellee Harris

2

have to succeed in crossing that threshold in order to ppevail.

3

The threshold question, is whether or not, where there

4

is a special procedure in a state for the raising of Federal

5

as well as state constitutional questions prior to trial, as

6

there is in the State of California as frankly and candidly and

?

fairly stated by Mr. Harris.

8

or raising, both of constitutionality of a statute on its face

9

and as applied and the sufficiency of the evidence adduced before

Where there is a special procedure

10

a Grand Jury in connection with such a statute, and where a

11

defendant charged with an offense has exhausted every available

12

— where there is a procedure available to him and where he has

13

taken every step under that procedure, and having failed in

U

these steps to secure to narrowing of the statute or a dismissal

15

of cases violating the First Amendment, whether or not if and

16

in the case involving only an expression of opinion, only pure

17

speech un accompanied by plots or conduct or acts or anything

18

other than expression of opinion.

19

The question is, therefore, when a defendant in that

20

circumstance, under that kind of a procedure in a State Court,

21

after having failed to secure narrowing of the statute in the

22

State Court by a procedure available to him to secure such a

23

narrowing, whether it be then and only then he repairs to a

24

United States District Court, whether the United States District

25

Court then if it chooses fails to abstain,then it uses its
20

discretion in such failure to abstain»
Q

Mr. Wirin, is there anywhere in these appendices

a record of what you did in the 399(a) proceeding or something?

Your Honor, the record is in two parts»

Now, in addition that, Your Honors, because and in

19

view of the fact that this is one of a number of cases

20

going to be argued before Your Honor on the issue of abstention,

21

we thought this Court ought to have available to it £.11 of the

22

proceedings in the California Courts, the proceedings before

23

the Superior Court, trial court, the proceeding before the Court

24

highly relevant and we printed them in this appendix to which

Your Honors have referred.
Now, as stated by the ATfcorney General in his brief,

11
12

the Attorney General says that the defendant has been charged with

13

acts in violation of the California Criminal Syndication Act.

14

One may call it what one wants, but the acts with which he is

15

charged consists solely of the distribution of two handbills on

IG

two separate days, therefore he is charged, with two violations

The

leaflets — I want to try to clear up a matter about which there

35

could be some misunderstanding.

The leaflets which this defen­

do with the defendant, which three leaflets pertaining to state­
ments made by organizations with which the defendant has no rela­
tionship.

These were leaflets which were never introduced before

the Grand Jury, leaflets which couldn't have been introduced
before the Grandy Jury because they are dated two years after
the indictment»
They are offered to Your Honors as evidence that Cali­
fornia is in grave peril from organizations that want to destroy
it and, therefore, these leaflets two years thereafter are rele­
vant to the indictment of the defendant two years before.
Q

Are the leaflets distributed by your client -23

I can’t seem to find them.

Oh, well, I can help you with that.

Q

I have found the ones you told us to disregard,

but I haven'fc found the other ones.

5

A

As a matter of fact, I don’t mind your reading

them because we make an argument about those leaflets that the

Attorney General of California is a zealous prosecutor and sees

8

dangers to California which no one else sees by virtue of these

leaflets

But the leaflet. I have doesn't answer your question.

The answer is, it is a blue document and on page

Exactly, Your Honor.

And pages 3, 5 and 6 are

18

dant, and the complete text of the leaflets.

19

Now you will notice upon reading the indictment, there

£0

is no reference to any conduct or any acts other than the distri

21

bution of these leaflets.
Now I have said to Your Honors and I am trying to

22
23

emphasize, because as I read this Court's decision, the distri­

24

bution

25

the press

of leaflets unaccompanied by acts constitute freedom of
exercise by the poor man, and I don't want to get into
24

!

the argument whether the exercise of freedom of the press has a

2

higher priority than other rights in the Constitution„

3

any event, it is a right which this Court has recognised again

4

and again where there is expression of opinion, where there is

S

no claim by the prosecution to the expression of opinion accom­

6

panied by any overt acts ---

7

Q

I would like to get this ciear»

But, in

I gather your

G

basic position is that it was appropriate for the Federal Dis­

0

trict Court to intervene, as it did, because, if I understand

10

your argument, you had in fact exhausted this special procedure

11

that California provides unsuccessfully to get a determination

12

that the statute was unconstitutional or to get a narrowing con­

13

struction.

14
15

A

That is precisely my argument, which I hope to

reach now in just about a minute or half-minute.

1G

Q

Don't overlook it.

\7

A

Wo, 1 had better not.

But just let me quickly

18

emphasise at this point that the Criminal Syndicalism Act, a par-

19

of which the Court passed and which may be found in the record,

20

which is a green paper, at pages 8 and 9, it is the record on

21

appeal.

22
23

Q

When you speak of "record,13 you mean the one

labeled "appendix"?

24

A

Yes.

Thank you, Your Honor.

25

Your Honors will look for a moment -- my moments to me
25

That is what I mean

1

are precious —■ at the text of the Criminal Syndicalism Act you

2

will find on page 8 that it is an act which proscribes doctrine

3

and precept»

4
5

6
7
8
9
m

So,- it is an act aimed at expression of opinion»

And, says Mr. Harris the Assistant Attorney General,
the defendant Harris was charged with subsection (3).

If Your

Honors will take a third of a minute to look at that which is
on page 9, you will find, that that makes it a crime to print,
publish, edit, issue, so forth.

So far as any charge against

this defendant is concerned, it is purely a charge involving the
expression of opinion.

ii

Now, I had better get to that problem of ----

12

Q

Yes, I suppose you are right, because, whether

13

or not that is constitutional, the real issue here is whether

14

you ought not fight that out in the state courts and not in the

15

Federal Courts at this junction.

«G

A

Yes.

17

Now our position is that this is not a case under some

18

of the abstention decisions by this Court where a person rushed

19

into Federal Court.

20

the Federal Court prior to axhausting available remedies to him

21

to secure the same kind of relief which he ultimately secured

22

the Federal Court from the. State Courts,

23
24
25

It is not a case where he sought relief in

And that leads me to a discussion, then — what I
would agree is the heart of this case

as tc the special

procedure, the nature of the special procedure in California to
26

I

do that because if California has a special procedure, whether

2

or not other states have it is at this moment of no concern to me,

3

though 1 think it is, of course, of concern to Your Honor's.

4

I think in other cases, in the other abstention cases following

5

this one rather than this one, where it is conceded by Mr. Harris

6

there is a procedure in California.

7

But

Of course we don8t agree entirely as to the’ scope of

0

that procedure.

9

summary, this is the thrust of our brief and this is the nature

10
11

12
13
14
15

16
17

We have brief the man and, by way of capsule

of our position.
We challenge the constitutionality of the statute on
its face and as applied in the trial court, to start with.

As

Mr. Harris conceded, in the California procedure, in contra­
distinction to procedure in the Federal Courts, a transcript
of the proceedings before the Grand Jury is filed with the Clerk
of the Court and a copy furnished to the defendant.
He may challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as

13

well as the constitutionality of any prosecution — of any

ID

statute upon which a prosecution is based in a proceeding which

-TV

£.0

is known as .Section 995 of the Penal Code.

22

Q

What is the number of that?

22

A

Section 995,

It is referred to in the complaint.

23

It is discussed more or less extendedly, particularly, Your Hanoi,

24

in our reply brief, which, is a manila covereddocument, at pages

25

6, 7 and 8.
27

Hr. Harris said to Your Honors that before a trial in

‘i

2

California — I think he said -- may challenge the constitutional

3

ity of a statute by habeas corpus or by petition for prohibition
A petition for a prohibition was filed by this defen­

4
S

dant. .

6

Q

In what court?

7

A

That goes to the first immediate appellate court

8

10
11

12
13
14

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

called the Court of Appeals.
Q

That is your intermediate appellate court, not

that special appellate you have in California?
A

No* that is not Appellate Superior Court* because

felonies are filed in your Superior Court.

Then it goes to an

intermediate appellate court known as Court of Appeals.
So an adverse ruling by the Court of Appeals* one goes
to the California Supreme Court by a document known as a petition
for hearing, in which petition for hearing all of the papers
which are filed for proceedings in the Court of Appeals go up
to the Supreme Court.
And in this state, as Your Honors will see if you will
examine the one copy of the proceedings in the California courts
compiled by the Clerk's'office, all of the proceedings in the
trial court are annexed to the proceeding in the Court of Appeals,
including the transcript of the record before the Grand Jury.

23
2.4
25

Q

Are you going to deal at some point with the

impact of 995 and 2283?

28

e.

A

2

Now, ifc is our view and we discuss it, Your Honor,

i

Yes

yes, I am.

o
•u?

particularly at these pages which I have referred to, pages

4

6, 7 and 8, that under California procedure the California statui .e

5

itself and the California Courts have ruled that relief must he

6

accorded to a defendant where the evidence is insufficient after

7

any essential element of the offense.

8
9

10
11
12

In this case, the essential element of the offense,
as Your Honors decided unanimously just this last term in Brandei
burg vs. Ohio, is that the advocacy must be accompanied by
incitement to imminent lawless action»

Urged upon all of the

California Courts was that there was no evidence before the
Grand Jury as there is no charge of the indictment of any incite­

13
ment as distinguished from advocacy of abstract doctrine,
14

15

And incidentally, Mr. Justice Harlan, you will be

10

interested to know that the District Court was greatly persuaded

17

by Your Honor's ruling in Yates and in Note -- maybe that remark

18'

I just made is irrelevant to my point which I am making.

19

But the distinction between abstract advocacy, on the

20

one hand, and incitement against those laws, ct the other, which

21

distinction is not drawn by this statute and, hence, it is over­

22

broad and vague under decisions of this Court.

23
24
25

That distinction

was never made, that distinction was never recognized by any
California Court in claims made by this defendant to that Court,
and therefore ■— two more things and then I am sure my time is

29

nt

up.

2

Therefore we do not agree with our adversary that the

3

California Criminal Syndicalism Act, an act aimed at precepts and

4

doctrines of that time, has

S

Courts to comply with the limitations that this Court has imposed

in Yates, Note and in other cases and, in particular, in Branden­

burg ,

Q

Are we called in this case to review the proceed­

ing that you have been spending so much time on here?

The ques­

!0

tion is whether the Federal Court had any business barging in

11

on the state prosecution at the stage in the face of 2283 and

12

in the face of a situation that carries no harassment of this

13
14

15
1C
17

man by finding an indictment against .hint,
That is the narrow issue in this case,
A

Well, I will address myself to that issue.

Q

Well, that is the whole issue.

A

But I will agree to do it.

But, Mr, Justice Harlan, it is my position that a
18
19

district court — now I «ant to say this firmly, but very

£0

respectfully — does not barge into a state prosecution when

21

there is a state procedure which authorises and provides for

22

relief prior to trial, which state procedure has been exhausted

23

by a defendant in every California court.

24
25

It is our view it is no disrespect to a state court,
it is no prostration of the authority of a state court if in
30

1

that circumstance,, when a state court has been given every oppor­

2

tunity to narrow a statute and has not done so , for a defendant

3

to then repair to the Federal Courts, particularly when he

4

couldn't come to this Court, because that situation is not a

5

final judgment reviewable,

6
7
8
9

And I must also confess, Your Honors, that I do draw
the distinction between a free speech case and another case.
Q

Mr, Wirin, you are not suggesting, are you, that

having exhausted this rather unusual California pretrial pro­

10

cedure, that he could not under state lav/ continue to assert

11

his constitutional defense that the criminal prosecution — you

12

are not suggesting anything of that sort?

13

14
15

A

No, I am suggesting nothing of that sort,

I am

merely suggesting —
Q

So that now he would be in the same position as

1G

would be the defendant in any other state that did not have any

17

such pretrial procedure as California has,

18

simply a defendant having been charged with an offense and there

IS

were available to him in the state courts all of the constitu­

20

tional defenses.

21

22
23
24
25

A

It need be just

Isn't that correct?

I agree entirely with what Your Honor has said

with, of course, a qualification.

My qualification is that so

far as the doctrine of abstention is concerned, a doctrine i
which is positive on the constitutional principle that the
Federal Court should not prostrate the actions of state courts,

31

I

1

except where appropriate, that if there is a special procedure

2.

in the state court and it is followed by a defendant, that it is

3

timely for him to repair to the district court and secure redress:

4

in the district court with respect to matters for which he has

S

not secured redress,
Q

Than you run up against 2283„

7

A

Now I come to 2283.

8

And there are two things to be said about 2283 in

6

9

connection with this case.

First, 2283 was never raised by the

10

District ATtorney in the trial court.

11

that is.

14
15
13
17

Maybe after I explain in a moment.
In the notice of appeal to this Court 2283 was not

12
13

I don't know how important

mentioned.

In the jurisdictional statement to this Court 2283

itfas not relied upon, although shortly thereafter the Attorney
General filed a memorandum in support of the jurisdictional
section, raising for the first time Section 2283.
Of course, in Section 2283 ■— it is a jurisdictional

18

statuta, and I don't understand that position, Mr. Harris.

It

19

can be raised here, whether it was raised below.

20

point of the fact that it wasn't raised below for this reason:

21

The District. Court essentially made a declaration that the

22

statute was unconstitutional on its face.

But I make some

23

Then, if I may say, to help the District Attorney it

24

went on and issued a preliminary injunction, sua sponde, not a

25

' request of the plaintiff, because all that was pending before
32

!

all that was pending before the District Court was a motion to

2

dismiss by the appellant.

S

and in order to give the District Attorney an opportunity to

4

appeal to this Court and secure a review, and had Section 2283

5

been raised in ths court below, it is very possible that he would

6

not have been issued an injunction for his declaration of

1

statute being unconstitutional would probably have been insuffi­

8

cient.

It issued a preliminary injunction

Now that is part of the argument, but not the main

9
10

part.

11

Now, Section 2283 contains three subdivisions, each of
i
in our view was complied with in this case.
One of the subdivi­

12

13
14

sions in Section 2283 is, "Where an order of a District Court
is an aid of its jurisdiction or an aid of its judgment."
At the time this matter was heard bv the three-judge

15
1G
17
18

District Court, no responsive pleading had been filed by the
appellate.

All that was before the Court was a motion to dis­

miss, which motion to dismiss the District Court rejected.

It

ID

had jurisdiction over the cause, so Mr. Harris concedes and,

20

therefore, to preserve its jurisdiction and its authority,

21

ultimately later it went a judgment, a declaratory judgment undet:

22

Zwickler vs. Koota, which doesn't involve the injunction statute

23

at all, and which was the only matter which the District

24

really decided.

25

And. in Zwickler vs. Koota he won it unanimous,

33

1

there was an exciting and concurring opinion bv Justice Harlan.

2

So, what the Court did,, therefore, was to issue an injunction to

3

sustain its jurisdiction in order to be able to effectuate its

4

ultimate judgment,, which coulcl have been only a declaratory

5

judgment, which as we say under Zwickler vs. Koota, it is quite

6

a "dump.”

7

And finally, of course, Your Honors, we make the argu­

8

ment, though this Court has never decided the matter, that the

9

Civil Rights Act under which this suit was filed in the District

10

Court, which authorizes the District Court to grant relief in

11

the way of damages and injunction, is one of the exceptions to

12

the injunction statute and that the District Court below, there­

13

fore, merely was complying with the authority which the Congress

14

has conferred upon it in the Civil Rights Act in issuing the

15

injunction in this case against an injunction not necessary,

1G

not issued at the request of the plaintiff, but issued to help

17

the District Attorney and to help Mr. Harris.

18

Q

Now would the result of that be that the state

19

has been helped to the extent that for four years they haven't

20

been able to move?

Is that right?

21

A

22

is one year too long.

Q

The thing we have before us is the injunction and

whether or not the appellant asked for it anything, to ms, is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT W. HARRIS, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. HARRIS:

I didn't get to the last two points in

IS

my opening remarks, because at the time the problem ■— I didn't

15

mean to waive any point in connection with either the merits

17
18

19

of the Act or the* impact of Section 2283, which we sat forth at
very considerable length in our brief.
We think it barred the injunction here in looking at

20

the complaint, which appears in the appendix and at page 7

21

it is quite apparent to me that a permanent injunction "was

22

prayed for, a temporary restraining order and a preliminary

23

injunction, in fact, were all prayed for by the plaintiff, John

24

Harris, and by the other plaintiffs here.

25

We still urge and I think if you will examine the
36

1

cases that have been cited by the appellee that the 999(a) pro­

2

cedure does not permit the raising of the constitutional ques­

3

tion that they presented here»

4

it within a procedural framework that would permit the state

5

courts to decide it.

6

They argued, but they didn’t do

We also submit that, however, whatever our view might

7

be or whatever the District Court’s understanding might ba of

a

the procedural niceties in California shouldn’t be determina­

9

tive of this case»

10

2283 still bars aninjunction without any regard to

11

what interlocutory procedures are provided for in California»

12

Now, as far as the declaratory judgment is concerned, we urge

13

that the statute can properly be saved and under Zwickler this

14

15
16

is a consideration that should have prompted the District Court
to abstain and let this statute be thrashed out in the state
courts and let John Harris have his remedy, and I think there
can be no real doubt that he has a real and meaningful remedy

within the California courts»
Only a week ago, Monday, this Court in Ware against
Schneider in 1225 affirmed percuriam a case out of Louisiana,
where the Federal District Court had abstained from getting into
a Louisiana prosecution and there there had been an application
to the Louisiana courts, in fact, an application to the Louisian;
Supreme Court for relief by the defendant during the course of
his application to the Federal Court»

37

1

This was not deemed to be of any great consequence

2

under that particular situation and x*/e think it is somewhat

3

comparable to the situation here,

4

niceties are in Louisiana, I have no idea, and we don’t that thi i;

case should turn on that.

^ow 'w"hat rhs procedural

2283 clearly barred the injunction.

The statute can

be salvaged insofar as Harris is concerned and certainly no more

than the one prosecution that he is facing.

There is no

1 think the delay here, as mentioned

in a question, has been very considerable.

As the case pro-

ceeded in the state courts, no doubt it could have been termi­
nated long since, and we stand here four years with the State
of California in the situation of being unable to proceed againsi:

14

John Harris, whatever the merits of that case might be; and,

15

more importantly, unable to proceed within the constitutional

1G

limits of the Criminal Syndicalism Act.

17

It is not a question of zealous prosecution, it is a

18

question enforcing the law within the proper constitutional

ID

limits that this Court has laid down.

20

in Brandenburg that within the Criminal Syndicalism Act there

21

is an area within which the state may properly act to prohibit

22

the advocacy of criminal means, whether it be killing all cops,

23

whether it be blowing up a building, arson or whatever.

And it certainly suggests

We think the state should be able to prove the
positive relationship between the advocacy and these criminal
