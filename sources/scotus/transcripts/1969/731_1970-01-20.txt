ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. ROBERTS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

I will conclude arguments for the respondents in this

manner.

written by Professor Charles Allen Wright in connection with a

14

speech he delivered on the Vanderbilt University campus inrOctobc >r

1969, entitled "The Constitution on the Campus."

the Oliver Wendell Holmes series and I think it is one of the

17

best-written articles I have ever read, and I commend it to the

18

Court if they haven’t already seen it.

19

I would like to call the Court's attention to an article

This is one of

In it though, Professor Wright basically wound up by

20

saying that expression can be restricted, if

21

materially or substantially interferes with the normal procedures

22

of the university or with the rights of others.

at any time it

Now it is our contention that the basic issue involved
here is just the action that this student had been accused and
found guilty of committing, based primarily under the First

of the Student Handbook, which had been a specific charge againsl

him in addition.

9

while before if and openly before it, arid I might say this:

They also found that he lied to the committee
It

10

was not only just -- he just told the president of the fact that

II

he was lying in front of this outstanding faculty group and other

12

students and even the press were present when this happened, which

13

compounded the disrespect that he showed the president on this

14

occasion.

15

IS

Yesterday I had the feeling that there was some ques- j
I
tion in the mind of perhaps Associate Justice Marshall in regard j

17

to why this action on the leaf-letting or the boycott literature

IS

didn't result in any kind of a serious incident.

19

the Court's attention to this, but I would like to at this time.

I didn't call

Mr. Jones at the time that he passed out this leaflet

He was

this literature.

He was awaiting his hearing to see whether or

appendix in the Student Handbook part of it, which begins on

3

page 175 of the joint appendix, the calendar of the school year,

4

you will find this was the last day of final examinations for the

5

last term of the summer quarter when he did this.

the baccalaureate service followed that by two days and school

7

was out then until the fall term started.

That is the reason there was no more commotion follow­

However, I direct

your attention to the fact that this

was followed itself by just a couple of weeks or so — a riot

on the campus and tensions were high.

of Dr. Basil’s poor health as the presiding officer over this

on the campus and as Dean of Students.

Yes, sir, and I think it would have been an

altogether different situation.

I think he could have perhaps eyen

gone across the street a little way tc Centennial Park and got
upon a bench and maybe made a speech on it and it would have
been somewhat different.
Here it was calculated to do one thing, cause unrest
and try to prevail his ideas and his desires onto the student
body there.

He had already been suspended.

for him not to register.

It wasn't a matter

He was trying to ask everybody else to

join with him, because his conduct had caused him to be suspended
to where he wasn't permitted to continue during the summer quarter
and was calling on them to do so.
Now as to the type of thing that was in this, I think
27

it is very important»

boycott so far as it being designed to create unrest, and we

3

have to keep in mind now that this was following a great deal of

4

disturbance on the campus where property was destroyed and people

we2e injured,

There was really more to it than just

Some of the things that he said, for example:

"If the

8

the reference he makes to them,

9

out this —■ "want to adopt the uncivilized tactics used by the

10

man" —- and that sort of thing.

Then he goes on with words like;

11

"Thus the campus will become a concentration camp controlled and

12

contained by the legislation of the racist dogs downtown, the

13

acts of the puppet administrators" — here again referring to

14

-these people before whom -he had already been, advised that he- was;

15

going to have to come and clear himself with before he could be

16

re-enrolled — "the bill$ clubs and guns of Nashville's racist

cops and ultimately the ghetto tactics of the honorable Nationalj

"We as intelligent black students will not be guarded

by trembling and perilous idiots who call themselves administra-j

Now that is what he is saying about the school admin-

istrators.

He said earlier that he came down to Tennessee to go

25

to school because he investigated and found that it was a great

an 18-year-old boy he conducted himself in such a way and has

Now if the Judicial Branch is going to substitute its

judgment for people of the character that I have described, of

7

this Faculty Advisory Committee on this question of fact, and it

8

really is a question of fact of whether or not these things,

these acts committed, were a type that would be disruptive on a

After all, you can effectively expal him that way.
If he doesn't at practically any university in the country, if
he doesn't make his grades, he is not entitled to enroll the
next quarter.

You could eliminate him in that manner.

I ju.st respectfully urge the Court to give some sup™,
port and some credit to these men with outstanding ability in
making a determination that involves a factual matter, and if
you do so, I feel the Court will affirm their action in it and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REBER F. BOULT, JR.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

3
4

MR. BOULT:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

Q

What about the previous convictions?

6

A

Mr,, Justice Marshall, if those two convictions

7

are to be considered, we have to reopen the entire disciplinary

8

proceeding.

9

Q

Is it in the record anyplace?

10

A

They are mentioned at several places in the recorql,

11

at page 48, for example, and various other places.

12

of that is --

The sequencej
(

13

Q

It appears to be contradictory in the record.

14

A

Certainly, he was convicted and it was on appeal

at the time the ?aearing was going on.

15

There is no--

It was a part of the charge against him?

16

Q

17

A

It was a part of the charge against, him.

18

Q

And it wasn't answered.

A

There was no conviction, so to speak, of the

/.

19

20 jFaculty advisory Committee on these charges.
J
Q
Weil, isn’t that sufficient to discipline him,
{

21

22

to ba convicted in a criminal court?
A

23
24
25

Honor.

I don’t think this is the issue of the case, Your

I doubt it.

If I was to argue the point, if I thought

the point were in the case --

31

%

Q

Doesn't it violate these rules on 75 or not?

2

A

The rule on being convicted of any city, county or

3

Federal offense?

4

Q

Yes.

5

A

I don't think it does, because it was on appeal.

6

Q

It was not found?

7

A

It was not.

Q

The conviction was not final.

The

cases were on appeal at the time of the proceeding.

9

Q

But that doesn't appear in tha record.

10

A

Yes, I believe it does. Your Honor, on page 48.

11

Q

What has happened since?

12

A

I don't know, Your Honor.

13

Q

You don't know?

14

A

No, I don’t.

You see, this issue has really

15

been in the case throughout any of the lower courts, because the

16

Faculty Advisory Committee exonerated him on these charges.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

He

was not dismissed from school for having violated that particular
rule.
The chairman of the committee so testified.

The
!

charges make no mention of it.
Q

Now does that mean that they ignored it?

You say

they exonerated him on that.
A

Well, they did not dismiss him from school for

I

that charge.
Q

They must have had adequate other grounds.
32

■
I

A

1

Possibly so.

There were half a dozen charges

2

against him and of the three students involved in the whole

3

thing, there were about IS charges and there was only findings

4

of, shall we say, guilt on a small number of these charges.

5

assume — it has been assumed up to this level, all the way

6

through case, that if the Faculty Advisory Committee did not

7

make a finding that a student had done on a particular charge,

8

then they were not disciplining him for it.
Q

9
10

We

Was the conduct from which these criminal charges

developed on the campus or off the campus?

11

A

Off the campus, totally unrelated to the campus.

12

Q

Do you suggest that he could not be dismissed —

13

laying aside the notice factor — that he could not be dis­

14

missed for conduct off of the campus?
A

15
16

It depends on the conduct, Your Honor.

This

particular conduct, I would say not.
Q

What was it?

A

Disorderly conduct.

19

Q

What was it?

20

h

As I recall the facts of the case — they are not-

17
18

21

22

of record — it was an argument with a police officer.

I believe

it was vagrancy and disorderly conduct.

23

Q

24

A

It was just an argument?
)j
It was just an argument.

He was coming out of
j

25

his house.

He was well known around town as unpopular.

33

He was

I

1

2

arrested on one of these general dragnet laws.
Now I am talking outside of the record,, because this

«y

point would have been developed if it had been in the case at

4

the time, but it was not.

5

The vagrancy statute in Tennessee under which he was

6

arrested has- since been declared unconstitutional and the dis­

7

orderly conduct, in fact, is similar to the one in the case

8

befox"a this Court of John vs. University Committee.

9

particular conviction was probably unconstitutional.

10

II
12

So this

Mr. Roberts has mentioned that the handing out of this
leaflet followed a riot by a couple of weeks.

That is not true.

He mentioned that Mr. Jones had already been suspended

13

at the time he handed out the offending leaflets.

14

sion was clearly unconstitutional on any of the lower courts’

15

decisions on student rights.

16

no nothing, and ultimately it was rescinded.

17
18
19

The suspen-

f

j

There was no notice, no hearing,

He was supended on three vague charges, none of which
were pressed later on in these proceedings.
Q

Now the only findings against this man, as I under-

20

stand it, appear on page 31 — at the bottom of page 30 and the

21

top of page 31 ~~ is that right?

22

A

That is correct.

23

Q

Which consist of the — the only explicit thing

24

is the distributing literature charge, although it says "on

25

different occasions to promote unrest on the campus by such action
34

1

as distributing literature."

It was designed for that purpose,

2

that is one of the findings.

And the other is that he didn't

3

tell the truth?

4

A

That's right, Your Honor.

5

In dealing with the case, we have given the benefit of

6

the ambiguity to the university and assume that it was about

7

the literature.

8

Q

Well, you will hardly get it in.

9

A

If, or?, the other hand,---

10

Q

They certainly find that he did that, that ha

n

promoted unrest by distributing literature, and the ambiguity

12

is whether the findings include other ways in which he promoted

13

unrest»
A

14

Yes, and if there are other ways, we can say that

15

due process lias been violated because the man has not been told

W

what he has been disciplined for.
I

I

Q

A

Are you urging that a college would not have ths

j
right to expel a man if they caught him in an outright falsehood?
I

23
24

Yes, but not disciplined for it

he had been found guilty of it.

21
22

He was told what he was

charged for, including those criminal convictions?

19
20

Now he was charged.

A

I don't think that issue is in the case, Your

Q

But they found him guilty of it?

Honor,

35

A

1

They never charged him with a falsehood,

2

never gave him a chance to say,

3

They just came down one day and said, "You lied,"
Q

4

They

"I didn't tell a falsehood."
That is all.

If a falsehood is committed as a part of the

S

response to other charges, do you mean to suggest they have to

s

start all over and give him some new charges,vhen the very people

7

sitting in the room have heard him make what they regarded as a

3

falsehood?

9
10

11

A

Just to analogize to the outside world, it would

be a perjury proceeding.
Q

Well, this isn't a criminal decision, counsel.

12

You are trying to equate this to a criminal proceeding and all

13

the constitutional protection of a criminal proceeding.

14

15

A

Not all, Your Honor,

I think at the very least

notice and opportunity to defend has been settled, although this

Court has not directly passed on it.

j

Q

It has been considered to

Are you arguing that if a man is held up to

19

answer a charge before a board of collega administrators and

20

he deliberately falsifies in their presence about the charges,

21

that they would not have the right to remove him from school?

22

A

Not at all, Mr. Justice.

j

23

Q

I thought they sentenced hirn.

24

A

I am arguing that if he is thought to have deliber­

ately falsified something, they should charge him with that, and 36

You mean, they have to charge him in advance?

2

A

At least --

The object of a school, 1 suppose, is to try to

and X wouldn't suppose -- at least in the schools I went to,
