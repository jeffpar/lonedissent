Yes, sir.
Proceed whenever you are

ready,
MR. HALLs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, I am Richard Hall, Appellant pro se in this case.

I

to

appear this morning to appeal from a decision of the United

11

States District Court for the District of Colorado, which

12

decision upheld the constutionality of a Colorado law which

13

requires that a voter be a resident of the State- of Colorado

14

for six months before being allowed to vote for President and

15

Vice President.

10

I must state to the Court that the law hi? a. since

17

been, amended by Colorado Legislature, and it now requires two-

IS

months residence.

19
20

Q

But your position is that two months is just as

bad as six months or one year?

been there two months,

How far down do you go?

A

Yes, sir*

The question is whether the waiting

Colorado has determined that you

election, so they don't evidently feel that they need six
months or two months in which to process the application or
perform any checks.

I think thequestion

Colorado, first, does not

make the .attempt to contact the old state and they feel that

suggest to the Court that. that, might foa an appropriate period.

You same frcra California?

f.

That is correct- Your Honor.

Q

What9s the rule in California, do you know?

A

Fifty-four days? Your Honor.

Q

Do you think that is uur@aspna.bXe?

e

8

A

Well, the State of Hew York as amicus for the

State of Colorado, say that they have more people*

Maybe the

state could show that they have added problems because of an
increased population
Q

You are suggesting, then,- that wo might he i:;

12

this waiting period unconstitutional in Colorado, but wholly

33

constitutional in California and New York?

24

IS

A

legitimate state interest to support their particular re­
quirement.

17

The particular states would have to have r.

New York claims in its brief that they *v\ -r added

problems that Colorado evidently feels it doss not hate.

IB

So we would contend, Your Honor

13

Q

As I understand it, you said there is sort-;,

20

sort of a burdeh, and 1 gather you think a rather heavy fci : <r i,

21

on a state to show a need for this sort of a residence reov', ce­

22

ment?
\

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

Why, in view of Article XX, Section X. and of

25

the 12th Amendment'of the United Stater Constitution, which

8

effectively provides that this is up tc eac :i state legislature!
Why do you think the state has to —
A

Well, Your Honor, I think that Article II,

Section 1 provides that the state can choose the manner in
which Presidential electors are appointed? but once they

decide that it is to be done by popular election? I would
suggest that Harper versus Virginia Board of Electioni

case ?

for example? which says that once the franchise is granted the
electorate, you'cenJt have classifications that invidiously
discriminate and I think this case affects both the right to
vote and the right to travel, both of which have been held by
Court very recently to be among the most fundamental and
precious rights we have*

Q

The right of free interstate travel? of courro,

is a constitutional right, as has bean held repeatedly r.il v or/
recently by this Court*

X know, that so far as X do know? that

it has never been held that the right to vote is a eoasiite ti onaj
right? a Federal Constitutional right,

In fact? there /re

statements that it is not*
*

A-

Well? I believe those statements cose from

cases that were decided in an earlier day? Your - Uouo's*
Q

Yes? under the same constitution,

But? 2 believe the recent cases such ass

right to vote is a fundamental right that the court protecto
