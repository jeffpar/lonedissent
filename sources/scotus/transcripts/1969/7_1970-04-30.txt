ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR* LOUISELL:

Your Honors, please* in view of the

we were discussing yesterday*

we submit that it is covered there*

On our supplemental brief*

have here under the statute a reviewable order*

in their motion to affirm* with great candor acknowledged this*

13

insofar as it is relevant.

It would* of course* be very unfortunate* I think*

And* of course* as we point out in our supplemen­

Your Honors* it seems to us that the cruse of this

from those facts being involved here — and even assuming every

10

yesterday as to whether the district court's old suspension of

normal course of events to adjourn on July 3.

I would like to

We filed

On the 19th the defendants filed an answer to the motion for

8

of the hearing set for the three “-judge court.

In January,

On January 23

9

So by January 23 everybody had their pleadings in

10

order? and the three-judge court had been convened, and ‘the

application for the preliminary injunction was then pending.
It was February 15th, some 2 or 3 weeks later, that

12

for the first time the motion to dismiss surfaced and was

IS

contemporaneously filed motion for continuance, seeking to

16

have the court put off the hearing that had already been

17

scheduled on the pleadings and concentrate only on the motion

18

to dismiss.
The court, on February 20, 3 days before the prev­

19
20

iously scheduled hearing entered an order deferring the motion,

21

or carry it along with case, as we say down there, and denying

22

Well, of course, we not only can but did ask for

The appellees here, the three young men who were

15

handled in Bell County as they were, and others called as

16

witnesses through their affidavit who ware there also as a

17

part of the demonstration, all said that -they were limiting

18

their activity in the Commi.ttee and in its peaceful protest,

19

that they would not return to Bell County, that they would not

20

engage in any demonstration in Bell County — and some said

21

elsewhere — so long as the statute was being used in the

22

fashion that it was.

23

Q

Could that conceivably be a form of protest

24

against the statute as well as bona fide expression of fear?

25

According to tee statute, it has got to be a fear, an

24

apprehension, doesn81 it?

Well, I think it was an expression of fear.

But he is in effect saying, as he did in the

15

pleadings, that the statute was valid, that the events that

18

occurred there were the disturbance of the peace, and he is

alleging really that that local event in Bell County was proper,

18

and as, in effect, the State of Texas adopting that position,

19

I tliink the court was entitled to consider that.

Mr. Clinton, ray problem is, assuming that the

Could you get the same relief by enjoining

those officials from acting, without knocking the statute out?

It appears to me that if -the statute is — of

We think, frankly, that the declaration that

I must again emphasize -this point that I am trying

11

12

to make," -that the court below acted very properly in seeing

13

•that there was a case and there was a controversy j -that it

14

was continuing? that it was very live, because of what the

15

appellees said as to restricting their activities? and that

16

they were justified in accepting that by reason of what had

happened to them in Bell County and what was threatened would

18

reoccur, in the event they went back to

Bell County.

the whole point of bringing it up is to justify what the court

that they were no longer going to engage in demonstrationis,

In Dombrowski it was sustained over a period of

which has this inhibiting effect — drying up contributions,

the sheriff, while still at the scene, told his deputy — who

I am quoting from your motion? you said that the

with which I agree — the court has not even given a declaratory

attention of Your Honor to the fact that you can’t blame

last sentence of rule 53 provides, "Attorneys shall not submit
