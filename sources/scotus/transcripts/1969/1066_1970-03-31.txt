Hr. Lee,

ARGUHENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ

S

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

8

7

HR. LEE:

8

The question in this case is whether the State of Ari­

9

Hr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

zona may constitutionally limit the right to participate in

*0

general obligation bond elections to real property taxpayers,

11

whose property in such an election the City of Phoenix will put

12

up as collateral security for repayment of the bond obligation

IS

and whose property is subject to lien of those bonds during the

U

life of the bonds.

15

The relative facts in this particular case can be simply
.
On June 10, 1969 there was submitted to the real property

16

stated.

17

taxpayers in the City of Phoenix, the largest aggregate bond issues

18

ever proposed by that city, calling.for a total of $170 million

19

to finance very badly needed improvements in the City.of Phoenix

20

2!
22

urgently needed at that time and even more urgently needed at
the present time.
Two of these issues related to revenue bond issues and

23

the other eight were general obligation bond issues.

24

days after the election was held, this Court handed down its

25

decision in Kramer versus Union Free School District and Ciprie.no.
2

Some six

i

versus the City of Houma, the latter of which held that it was

2

unconstitutional to prohibit nonproperty owners from voting in a

o

revenue bond election.

4

Court in Cipriano applied its holding prospectively only
i

5

and held open the question of the applicability of Cipriano to

S

general obligation bonds.

i

Because of the cloud which Cipriano cast over the bonds

7
8

of the City of Phoenix, because of the urgent need on the part

9

of the City of Phoenix for the facilities which were to be financ 0C

10

by these bonds, this suit was brought raising the question which

11

this Court now has before it.
Miss Kolodziejski, the plaintiff in .this case is an

12
13

employee of the leading investment banking firm in the City of

14

Phoenix, specialising in municipal bonds.

15

property, she rents her living quarters.

I

She owns no real

It is stipulated that the real property taxes which

16
17

her landlord pays have a material bearing on the amount of taxes

18

or on the amount of rent which she is charged.

19

A question which arises at the outset of this case con

20

cerns the relevant test which is to be applied to determine the

2!

right of the state through its constitution and its statutes to
■

22

prescribe qualifications under which resident citizens of the City

23

of Phoenix can participate in general obligation bond elections. ;

Pis

24

Let me ask you a preliminary question.

A

Yes, sir.

It occurred to me that maybe there is an answer to

it.

oO

issue as a matter of time limits of an act?

But under your state law could she have attacked this bond

A

4
5

Mr, Justice Harlan, in my opinion the answer to

that question is yes.

But no one really knows the answer to that]

6 question,
The State of Arizona,, unlike the Stats of Louisiana,

1
0

does not have and so far as I know there is really one state that!

9

has a statute exactly like it, the one in Louisiana,

It does not

10

have the kind of statute that provides what they call a per­

11

emption period at the end of which there is no further challenged
Arizona is really at the other end of the spectrum in

12
13

this sense:

14

five-day period, which was obviously intended to apply to elec-

15

fcion of officers.

|

There is one governing case which is rather difficult

16
17

The only election challenge statute that exists is a;

to read and lawyers can differ on exactly what it means.

Suffice

18

it to say that there is serious question under the laws of the

19

State of Arizona whether there ever comes a time that there is no

20

longer the opportunity to challenge a bond election,

21

Q

I gather you are not raising that.

22

A

Mo, sir, indeed we are not.

23

Q

I supposes the state can waive it, can’t it?

24

A

Yes, sir,

25

Indeed we are not.

Yes, Mr. Justice White, in my opinion

we can.

i

1

Q

You received a five-day limit here.

2

A

It would have been five days after the canvass.

3

Q

Which would have been July 28th or June 22'?

4

A

It would have been June 28th, yes, indeed.

5

Q

Which would have beers. -—

A

That is correct,

So they really have some time to file.

That is correct, and did not file within the five-

14

State law. No. 1, there is a question of whether she did or did

15

not file it within the proper period of time? and, No. 2, in my

16

opinion it is a matter that can be waived.

17

We are not relying on it.

18

This Court over a period cf a century has laid down the

very salutary rules and a rule that is reflected in, oh, at least

half a dozen separate decisions of this Court, that in determin- ;

22

are allowed a broad discretion in setting qualifications and

The states

23

determining the circumstances and the qualifications under which

24

25

There was an exception carved out from that rule by this
5

f

:ourt1s decision last term in Kramer versus Union Free School

2

•istrict, and becaue that exception lies at the heart of the

3

■esolution of the issue in this case, it Is important to note the

4

>recise circumstances under which that exception prevails,

5

therefore, it is important, I feel, to look at the exact language

6

sf the Kramer case.

7

Kramer spelled out that the circumstances under which

8

:he exceptions to the general rule apply is as follows:

That

9

:he broad latitutde which courts usually accord the legislative

10

judgments in this area is based on the assumption that the insti­

n

tutions of state governments are fairly constituted.

12

rhen the attack is an attack on that very assumption, then the

13

issumption itself can no longer serve as a basis for presuming

And that
l
■

14

15

:onstitutionality.
It follows in view of the Kramer Court that the general

16

rule upholding the judgment of legislators, where reasonable, and.

17

: am quoting, "does not extend to decisions concerning which resi
;
tent citizens may participate in the election of legislators and
'

18
19
20

2!

22
23

.

>fcher public officials."
The Court was very specific on this point and reiterated,
.t a number of times.

Now it is true, as Justice Stewart pointed

)ufc in Kramer, that it was not limited to the election of New
forkilegislators which necessarily imposed that limitation.

Never

24

bhel'ess, whether right or wrong in Kramer, and. I accepted it as

md the school board in Kramer, the City Council in this case,

5

md bond elections do not fit within that exception category,

6

therefore, we submit that the limitation involved in this case

?

aust be upheld.

8

Q

What did you do in Cipriano?

9

A

That Cipriano, Mr. Justice Harlan, is an enigma.

10

Q

But it is on the books.

11

A

Yes, it is on the books.

But it did hot overrule

12

- in fact, both it and the Kramer decision itself specifically

1.3

said we are not overruling Lassiter, Pope v. Williams, Mason v.

14

Missouri and Harrington v. Rash.
Q

15

Those are listed, or at least some ares listed which

16

join in the defense of Kramer and found it impossible to sentence

17

2ipria.no.

i

18

A

And the reason that you found it impossible to sen.

-

19

:ence Cipriano, Mr. Justice Harlan, is this:

20

iissent in Cipriano, that under any circumstances —■-

•

As I read your

21

Q

No, I assigned Justice Steward.
■

22

A

Yes, and I realize you filed a separate one for

23

>ther reasons.

But Mr. Justice Stewart's and Mr. Justice Black'si

24

Iissent in that case pointed out that under any circumstances

25

:here was not a reasonable basis for the exclusion in Cipriano,

1

md the reason was that there simply was not a reasonable connec-

2

:ion between exclusion of property owners in a revenue bond

3

election, and that hangs on the difference between revenue bons

4

md general obligation bonds, and I propose to bear down very

5

leavily on that particular distinction.
The most that can be said about Cipriano, Mr., Justice

6

'

7

terl'an, is that it was vere dictum, and the procuriam opinion

8

landed down the last day of the term -- and X don’t want to --

9

fell, all X can say is it was simply a kind of a washover

from

10

And if you read Kramer carefully, it should not be made

12.

sorrow the phrase used by the Solicitor General, that a century

13

sf this Court's decisions should be laid to rest with nothing

And I do not feel, to

(lore than the simple statements of compelling state interest xn

15

-he Cipriano without any attempt to reconcile it with the rather

16

jareful reason, whether right or wrong, that was set forth in

17

(Cramer.

18

I turn then to discussion of the ---

19

Q

20
21

22

I would lay aside a lot of history, too, when we

«rent to Reynolds and Sims.
A

Well, X recognise that, Mr. Justice Harlan.

All

[ am saying is --

20

Q

You were having an argument with that case?

24

A

No, 3: didn’t intend to reargue Reynolds v. Sims,

2 e?

4r. Justice White.

i

1

But all 1 am saying is, that all excepting Reynolds v.

2

Sims, excepting Kramer for Its reasoning, accepting Cipriano v.

3

the City of Houma — this is a different case and for reason

4

which I am not about to discuss, the Court should go no further

5

than it has gone in Reynolds v. Sims and in Kramer and Cipriano,

S

and I submit, fir. Justice Harlan, because I know of your feelings ,

7

that this is a different case and it does not involve the same

8

problem„
The reason that it does not involve the same problem

9
10

rests upon the difference between a revenue bond election, on the

11

one hand, and a general obligation bond election, on the other

12

hand.
In a general obligation bond election there are two

13
14

issues that are submitted to the electorate that are relevant

15

for present purposes.

16

Phoenix obligate itself •— borrow money and obligate itself to

17

repay that money through the imposition of taxes, real property

18

taxes perhaps supplemented

The first of these is, will the city of

by sales taxes.

19

That is one question.

20

Q

Or anything .else -that is

21

A

That is available, that is correct, Mr. Justice

23

Q

From any source, except some taxes —-

24

A

Designated, that is correct.

25

In Allison v. the City of Phoenix the Arizona Supreme

22

White.

9

I

Court said that there was an obligation only to impose real

2

property taxes where necessary, but if the city had available

o

■ni

some taxes from another source, they could use it.

4

agree, Mr. Justice White

.

5

6

Q

So 1 will

The only thing they promised the bondholders was

the property tax?

7

A

The property tax plus the

8

Q

That's what 1 mean.

S

A

They promised it.

lien on the property.

They ——
And by

statute the City of

10

Phoenix is obligated to tax that property to a sufficient extent

11

tc repay the bonds.

12

Q

13

14
15
16

If they fail to do so, then there is real trouble;,

isn’t there?
A

That is correct.

The point of taking the property

and selling it at a tax lien sale.
And that brings me to the second issue.

In any general

17

obligation bond election, and I will concede that there might

18

— that Miss Kolodziejski might have about the same interest in

19

the first question, because it is true that maybe she is going

20

to participate to some extent or another in the payment of the

21

taxes on a year-to-year basis if things go well.

22

But there is a second issue really in any general obli­

23

gation bond election.

And that is this:

24

nix impose a lien by way of collateral security for the obliga­

9E

tion, the money that the City of Phoenix is borrowing on the
10

Will the City of Phoe­

i

property of each individual property within the City of Phoenix.

2

That is the real difference»

3

The City of Phoenix is borrowing money.

It is borrowing

4

it on a secured obligation? unlike revenue bonds which are ansa- ;

5

cured obligations.

6

The City of Phoenix is putting up the security and, as

7

is the case with any secured loan, it can get a better interest

8

rate if it puts up security than if it doesn’t put up security..
Q

9
10

Well, when you say it puts up some security, it

puts up security of someone else3s property, not its own property'
A

11

Precisely.

This property does not belong to the cijfc]

12

The property it is putting up as security belongs to the Robert

13

Baxsteins and the Fred Rosenfelds, who live within the City of

14

Phoenix.

15

Now under the normal course of events if all goes well

IS

and we don’t have a depression, and the City of Phoenix prospers,

17

then the City of Phoenix will probably be able to repay these

18

bonds over the entire; 21-year period from a normal amount of

19

property tax revenues and from the. sales taxes.

20

Q

What is the rate of interest?

21

A

The maximum rate of interest, Mr. Justice Black,

22

under the present statutory provisions of the State of Arizona

23

is 6 percent.

24
25

It probably will be able to repay it.

And it is very

possible that the landowners and the Emily KoXcdisiejskis within

11

i

the City of Phoenix wont8 notice a materially different impact

2

from these bonds»

3

risk that is assumed bv the property taxpayers and the nonpropert

4

taxpayers in that the property taxpayers have their property sub-;

5

jected to a lien.

6

the City of Phoenix has borrowed, and I think the purest illustre

7

tion of this lies in the bonds that are referred to bythe amicus

8

brief; .that has been filed by the City of Salt Lake.

But undeniably there is a difference in the

Their property is put up as security for what

9

They refer there to airport revenue bonds, which are

10

revenue bonds in which the city anticipates will foe paid from

II

revenues generated by the airport.

12

as general obligation bonds because it can get a better interest

13

rate»

14

But the city won't issue thesie

Anyone who has ever had any experience, as I am sure

15

all the members of this Court have, with commercial transaction

16

know that a loan can be made on conditions more favorable to the

17

lender if he puts up some kind of security.

18

Q

Mr. Lee, do you have a sales tax in Phoenix?

19

A

Yes, sir, we do.

20

Q

Personal property tax?

21

A

Well,

22

Q

May I also assume that, some of the property there,

23

that the taxes there are paid by the people that ara renting?

24

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

25

Q

Is there money involved?
12

1

A

Their money is involved, Mr. Justice Marshall,, in

2

the annual repayment or may be involved.

3

those people and the real
Q

4
5

The difference between

This will settle ray question.

Is the payment of

these bonds limited fco real property taxes?

6

A

NO.

7

Q

That is all I want to know.,

8

A

Under the decision of the Arizona Supreme Court in

9
10

Allison v. the City of Phoenix, you can use sales taxes.

You

must use property taxes, if necessary.

;-

My point is, there is not a constitutional difference

11
12

or we don't need to look fco the difference in source of the

13

payments year by year for the constitutional difference.

14

view the constitutional difference appears in the fact of the

15

risk that the property owner is taking.

IS

18

Now if the City of Phoenix were saying, we are going
‘
fco borrow money, we can get a more favorable interest rate on
■
this money if we put up some security and the security we are

19

going to put up, the cash surrender value of life insurance of

17

In my

■

20

every citizen of the City of Phoenix, stocks and bonds investment]

21

portfolios of every citizen in the City of Phoenix, and the

22

savings accounts.

Then I think we would have a different, case.,

j

*

23

Q

Could they do that?

24

A

It would be impractical, Mr. Justice.

25

Those three things you mentiorjec
The reason

j

it would be impractice is because those things are made — but
13
i

1

those things don't necessarily stay within the City ©£ Phoenix.

2

Phe only thing of value that is clearly going to stay within the

3

2ity of Phoenix during the 21“year period is the land.

A

Now, in my view it is the same as though we had two

-v

5

joint obligators on a. promissory note, only one of them supplying

S

security for the note, and there is a material difference between

7

the interest of those two in whether the bonds are to be sold or

8

lot, particularly when you bear in mind that the election --

9

tfhich is what we are talking about here — is only the second

10

step in a three-step process involved in the issues of bonds.
Mo bonds are ever issued by any municipality in any of

n
12

the states that have this kind of restriction unless, first of

13

all, the City Council or the school board or someone determines

14

the bonds should be issued.
That determination is made by a body that a la. Kramer

15
16

las been property apportioned elected fairly by all the people.

17

Phe election is the second step, and the third step is the actual

18

Issuance and sale, which again lies within the discretion of the

19

2ity Council or whatever the particular body may be.

20

Now is this an election by a majority vote ——

A

We have no apportionment problems here.

q

22
23

Q

~— without reference to the amount of their

sroperty?

24

A

That is correct,

25

Q

I mean, if a man owned $10 worth of real estate

14

1

his vote would count as much as if he owns $1 million worth who

9

votes.
A

«vi?

4
5

That is correct.

We don’t have the Louisiana prob­

lem here.
Now I would like to devote just a. few moments to the

e

prospectivity-retroactivity problem.

7

ate that, under any conceivable test, there is a distinction

We do feel, and I reiter­

8 between general obligation bonds and revenue bonds, a distinc­
9
10
11

tion which under this Court’s authority renders the Arizona
law constitutional.
However, in the event that this Court should disagree, 1

12

do suggest very strenuously that the decision, should be prospec­

13

tive only and 1 would like to discuss that briefly with the Court,

54 because of the great interest which has bean created and because
15

of the importance of this matter also to the City of Phoenix

16

and its need for the $170 million worth of financing.

17
18

The Court has noted, X am sure, that there have been
' ■
12 different briefs filed from a collection of about eight dif­

19

ferent statements across the country, whose provisions are similair

20

to those of Arizona.

activity vis-a-vis prospectivity indicated that the decision

23

should be prospective only are compounded in the case of general

24

obligation bonds, and that there is even more reason why general j

25

I

\

should affirm the lower Court’s decision, should be prospective

2

only from the date of this. Court's decision in this particular

Af

5
6

Q

May I ask you what effect that would have on the

2ity of Phoenix?
A

Well, we hope, Mr. Justice Black, that it would

•3

X

hold them — that it would validate these bonds.

S

say why I hope that this would be the case.

9

And let me

May 1 point out, first of all, that in the Allen, case

10

two terras ago, which also involved an election under the ’65

11
12

Noting Rights Act, this Court held its decision prospective not
‘
only as to other elections, but also as to the election involved

fl O

in the particular case that was at issue.

u

■

The City of Phoenix held its election prior to Cipriano,

15

six days prior to Cipriano.

16

that are raised by this Court's decision in Cipriano and in the

n

lllen case that we feel are relevant and helpful in the determina

IS

tion as to prospectivity in the instance case.

19

j

There are three differant questions

i
In Cipriano this Court mentioned significant hardships

20

tfhich were the result from a retroactive decision made.

21

simply point out not only in the case of Phoenix, but also in

22

Well, let me address myself to that problem.

In those states that have a Louisiana-type statute and

off-hand I think there is only one, then that rule works fine.

In those states which do not have that type statute, and Ari­

Now here is another reason, Mr. Justice White, why I

18

feel it should be 'the election, in answer to your earlier question.
.
■
The City of Phoenix, held this election on June the 10th,

17

Cipriano came down on June 16th.

18

the City of Phoenix,, acting in perfectly good faith, took steps

19

to have the question determined as to whether its bonds were good

20

or not, and that is why we are here and we are here first.

15

21

22

Now subsequent to that time

Subsequent to that time there were a number of elections
held and as you look in the amicii briefs that have been filed
.

23

— Colorado, Louisiana, Utah didn't have one, Tulsa, Oklahoma,

24

Florida, Idaho and Texas.

25

subsequent to Cipriano.

All of those have held elec lions

that especially for schools

and that is one reason why it is more important to hold it

the revenue bond context, and that is the only way schools can

5

finance, and schools simply cannot wait.

so many school elections.

That is why you find

They had to be held.

So under — and that case is not here

many of those

8

elections would be approved under any rule, under the Cipriano

9

rule if it were applied here, simply because they went ahead and

10

held their election and in the State of Texas they actually sold
:

their bonds.

11

12

We submit that there is no reason why the City of Phoe­

13

nix should be in any lesser position, having proceeded in good

14

faith, as the City of Phoenix did, in an orderly way to get the

15
16

question resolved, arid really frankly doing a service to the ofche r
13 states in this country, and Cipriano, I know very candidly,
has thrown the municipal financing community of the 13 states

On behalf of Miss Kolodsiejski we suggest that the

Lower Court.

18

In relation to the city’s argument, which is in effect
•

19

to limit both Kramer and Gipriano to factual contents of each

20

:ase, we feel that this should be specifically rejected.

2!

Kramer case, we will admit, stated that the rule would apply and

22

in the first, instance it seemed to say the rule would apply to

23

election officials.

24
25

|

The

However, it went on and there are portions of the Krames
case that seem to imply fco me, and to a great many people that I

22

i

1

know in this business, that it applied fco all special elections.
In the Kramer case I cite as follows:

2

"Thus, state ■

enforcement statutes which may dillute the effectiveness of sorae
citizens' votes, receive close scrutiny.

Wo less rigid an exami­

nation is applicable to statutes denying the franchise to those
6

otherwise qualified by residents in age.

Therefore, if a chal­

lenged stat& statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide

j

I
residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the fran­
o

chise to ofhers, the Court must determine whether the exclusion is
necessary to promote a compelling state interest."
Now Mr. Lee has stated that the Cipriano case was actual

11

12

decided on the basis of the rational basis doctrine.

I must

13

admit to a great deal of confusion on this approach.

The —

14

citing from the Cipriano case, and that as you know, gentlemen,

15
16

was a municipal bond, election referring to revenue bonds, not
the general obligation bonds."
You stated in Cipriano,

17

"When, as in this case, the sols

18

justification is rational basis for limiting the franchise to

19

those voters with a special interest, the statute clearly does

20

riot meet the exacting standard of precision we require in statute s

21

which selectively distribute the franchise, citing the Kramer

22

case."
It appears to me that this is every indication that the j

I
24

Court meant to apply this rule to all elections, not just to the i
'

25

elections of officials.

|

23

Now, I ask what sense would it be to apply a special

z

rule to revenue bond; elections and another rule to general obli- j
gation bona elections, and yet another rule to special-purpose

4

elections that cities have to buy property, which school districts;

5

often have, or need authority to build a new schoolhouse or sell •

6

school property.
In Arizona many of these types of elections — and we

7
8

have a lot of them — are also limited to real property taxpayers.

9

Do we have aseries of rules here or do we have one specific rule

10

that applies to all limited elections.
We feel that the Court, should follow the teachings of

ft
E £i,

13

both Kramer and Cipriano, and should reaffirm the rules set forth.
:
in those cases in the opinion,' in this case.

14

Now, 1 think another part —

IS

Q

16

When you say "reaffirm," do you possibly mean

extend the rules to reach this case?
.

A

17

18
19

Yes, sir.

It is our position that the rule applies

■

to all special elections, notwithstanding the type of election,
.

so in that context it*would be reaffirming.

It may be an exfcen-

\

20

23
24

I guess it would be interchangeable almost in that situa- j

fcion «,

21

22

sion*

Another thing to note in Cipriano, the Court appeared,
.

as I stated, to take the more rigid approach to that election.
The dissent — Mr. Justice Black’s dissent — used what I believe
to be the rational basis doctrine or the general test for the

Fourteenth Amendment against the -—•

In what case was that?

Q

There was no dissent in Cipriano.

Excuse me, in the Kramer case.

—- to the effect that the restriction was wholly

irrational.

Now if it was wholly irrational, if this is the

S

opinion of the minority, it could also well have been the opinion

9

of the majority.

But the majority opted for a more specific test;

10

so we feel that in the reading of Kramer and Cipriano there was

1!

ample reason for us to believe that the Court meant, to apply this

12

tc all special elections.

13

Q

Well, if it applies to all special elections and

14

Phoenix called an election to decide zoning rules for real

property owners and restricted that*to real property owners, what

16

would you say?

Besides being interested both subjectively and pecunariljy,

we also feel that the appellee is interested and has an objective!

stake in the outcome of this election.

in all bond elections, the bond authorization is not the only

to place the municipal improvements desired by those voting is
completely wiped out,,
1 think one of the lessons of the election cases and
voting rights cases and voting rights legislation that we have
had over the past decade is the fact that the fruits of the
election gravitate toward the political power.

Here we have a

situation which is basically unfair, a class of people are in a
24
25

position where they cannot exercise any power.
And I might, say this, and I speak from my past experienc a

in this area.

The general inclination on all bond elections is

Q

What was that?

4

A

To carry, that the election will carry.

Mine times out of ten the purpose will be tailored

6

toward those with the voting power.

Now if we exclude certain

7

citizens from the elective process and if we exclude certain

8

citizens who have a real stake in municipal improvements in the ■

9

area of schools, it might be said that renters in the slum areas

m

have an even greater stake in. the improvement or the construction

n

of new schools in their area.
But when we take away this power to these —■ this power

12

13

over the elective process, this power of the combined vote of

14

the tenant class to carry the election, then we have not only

15

affected the tenant class through rents, maybe through excise

16

taxes, but we have affected their objective state in the elec­

17

tion.

18
19
20

Q

What you are really arguing now, though, is the

wisdom of the Arizona structure.
A

Well, I am arguing — I have to say that this.

The

footnote in the Kramer case seemed to say that interest meant

21

22

the intent to vote.

2o
?*

was what the Court was intending to do, that the mere interest

24

is an interest sufficient to take the man to the polls to vote

.

25

Mr. Justice Stewart's dissent said that it

But I have tried to show that the interest of the tenant

generally goes much further than that.

2

tenant is cumulative, subjective to pecuniary and objective.

o

■C>

The interest of the

Now, it also is, 1 think, a basic tenet of our civilisa­
tion that the rent is going to be passed on to the tenant.

The

s

appellants in their brief state that the appellee is unique in

6

this fashion.

7

Turner v. Fusch stated as follows:

However, this Court in a very recent case of

8

"It cannot be seriously urged that a citizen in all

9

other respects qualified to sit on the school board must own

10

property if he is to participate responsibly in the educational

‘i 1

decisions without regard to whether he is, among other things,

12

a lessee who effectively pays property tax as part of his rent," ;

13

I think the Court has noted what to me is a fact, a

14

basic tenet of our capitalistic society, that the landlord, in

15
16

order to get a fair return, must pass on the real property tax
;
as a cost of doing business.
If the real property taxes go up,

17

his rents are going to go up accordingly, so he can keep his

'18

fair return.

.

...

.

IS

Now another point in this argument turns on the fact

20

that there is no qualitative approach on the part of the state

21

of Arizona or the City of Phoenix to determine just how much real

22

property is necessary in order to allow the elector to vote.

23
24
25

It is clear in my mind that so long as the man actively • a
pays real property taxese he may own one square inch of property,
e will be allowed to vote.

A person leasing thousands of acres

30

J

of property has no standing to vote in the same election»

z
'i

However, if xm are tal.lci.ng about the mere tokenism of
owning property, then we are in

the situation which this Court

4

condemned in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections where it said

S

that, "The test of wealth is not germane to informative voting."
It is easy to draw an example where the owner of real

6
7

property who would be allowed to vote could have a very small
f

f

8

interest in the property that he owns.

If, for example, we

9

f
have someone owning $10 worth of taxable property at the assessed

ID

level and we have B who owns or who leases a $10,000 home, on

11

the assessed evaluation basis.

12

13
|4

month B is going to pay a bigger share of this, of the debt
incurred for these bonds than A will pay for the entire term.
However, B will not be allowed to vote and A will.
It might also be pointed out that, as I said, one of

15
16
17
18

We have a situation where in one

the tenets of our society is that the entrepreneur takes the
risk»

The lessee of .real property must live on property owned

by somebody.

If it is a corporation, the corporation, can't vote.j

■

10

If it is a private source, the private source could vote if he

20

lived in the city.
However, one of the risks that this entrepreneur takes

21

22
23
24
25

is the risk that he will have tenant throughout the life of his
building.

In the event that taxes are to increase, this is part

of the risk.

So it is no grave imposition on the landed plan to

remove the restriction that only real property taxpayers may
31
i

•a?E

vote»

2

In our brief we cited some examples and the only one

O
w

I wish to point out is a situation where, under this particular

4

type of statute one person could own the entire municipality.

5

No civic improvement could be made unless that one person agreed

6

to it .
Now this is not exactly too far-fetched.

7

In ray brief

8

I pointed out two examples, one where two people carried, where

9

the vote carried two to nothing; one where the vote was defeated

10

by a score of one to nothing.
We feel that the statute in the Constitution of the

1!
12

state merely requires a token ownership of property,

13

the interest effected is in no way relative to the fact that the

'14

And that

man owns property, because you can pay more in a lease in a month

15

than the owner of a small piece of property could pay throughout 1

16

the life of the bond,
■

Tokenism, via feel, should not be a constitutional dis-

17
18

tinction.

Yet that is what we have here.

However, in the event j

19

it is shown that the appellee and her class are less interested

20

than those who are allowed to vote, this does not carry the day

21

for the appellant.
The appellant must a,Iso show that the interest the state)

22
23

seeks to protect is compelling.

I am at loss to know the appel- j

lant's position on compelling state interest.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

MR. LEE:

I don’t really understand what Mr. Rosenfeld

If

just said about whether there is or is not a cutoff period, but

12

I submit my case is now made that there is confusion on this

13

point in the State of Arizona.

14

very least serious question as to whether there is, and we do not

15

have the type of situation that exists in the State of Louisiana.

16

Under those circumstances 1 simply reiterate my original

And there certainly is at the

17

position, and that is that the election is the thing that raises

18

the constitutional question, should be the election, should

19

be this crucial date as of any prospective decision, any question

20

of prospectivity should be applied.

2f

I simply reiterate that there is no question that this

£2

does involve an extension of Kramer and Cipriano in any way,

23

whether you take the Kramer dictum or net.

24

Court that whether Kramer was a good decision or not in the first

25

place, when you extend that compelling state interest test to
