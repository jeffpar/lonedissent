MR. VINTILLA:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

MR. VINTILLA:

Number 66.

Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Vintilla.

And may it please the Court:

We have

here before the Court today a problem which this Court had

10

occasion approximately two years ago to review and pass judg­

11

ment on it.

12

We have in review here the so-called Iron Curtain

13

Ststate in the State of New York, known as the New York

14

Surrogate's Procedure Act, formerly Sec. 2S9-A.

15

recent amendment of June. .196-8 known as Section

16

Nov;, for the

Now, this statute in substance, provides that an

17

heir or legatee or beneficiary of funds from an estate or other

18

©source, in New York who happens to reside in one of the so-

19

called Iron curtain countries, that the State of New York will

20

protect this particular citizen national of that country by '

21

withholding the transmittal of his distributed share of the

22

funds that he's entitled, to if he would not have the benefit

23

or use or control of the money or other property due him? or

24

if there are other special circumstances that make it desirable

25

that payment should be withheld.

t

2

1

Now, this law of New York is substantially identical

2

toone of the three provisions of the Oregon statute which this

3

Court struck down as an impermissible interference of Federal

4

power over foreign affairs.

5
6

Is there any escheat provision inthe New York

A

Your Honor, the New York laws are custodial

law?

7
8

Q

in nature.

It does not provide for escheat.

9

Q

Under any circumstances?

10

A

Under any circumstances.

11

12
13

14
15

and ultimately it is placed in the deposit in one of the banks
in New York until such time as the particular heir or bene­
ficiary or his representative can come in and satisfy the Court
that he will have the use arid benefit,

18
19

02*

that circumstances

have changed and then the Court can reconsider the matter.
As a practical matter funds belonging to Romanian

16
17

The money is placed?

Nationals who have been blocked in excess of 25 years, as the
matter now stani 3, there was one challenge to this statute by
Romanian heirs, the Greenberg case which we mention in our
brief.

And in that case the heirs sought to establish to the

satisfactionof the Surrogate of New York County that they do
have the use, benefit and control and that circumstances are
such in Romania that they ought to be permitted to have the
money.
And the Surrogate there found that the evidence was
3

1

not of such a nature to convince him that they would have the

z

use and control or that the circumstances have changed.

3

this matter was appealed fco the Court of Appeals of New York

4

and denied leave to appeal.

5

in the Appellate Court which affirmed and allowed that decision

6

to stand.

7

Now,,

Allowed the Surrogate’s decision

Now, in our case, citizens who are entitled — have

8

been and are entitled to funds which have been withheld from

9

them, challenged the New York statute by filing an action in

10

the United States District Court for the Southern District of

11

New York; challenged the constitutionality of that statute and

12

sought to have its application enjoined insofar as the rights

13

of Romanian nationals are concerned,

14

AT the same time they asked for the convening of a

15

three-judge court to hear the constitutional challenges to the

16

New York statute.

17

convening of a three-judge court on the grounds that ha

18

thought the constitutional challenge was frivolous.

19

to the United State Court of Appeals the Court right from the

20

bench affirmed the District Judge in holding fchfet the con­

21

stitutional challenge is not serious enough to convene a court:

22

and upon certiorai granted by this Court, this Court summarily

23

reversed and remanded the case back to the United States Court

24

of Appeals for further consideration in the light of Zschernig

25

versus Miller, which this Court has decided while the petition

The District Judge initially denied the

4

On appeal

/

!

Z

for certiorari was pending initially»
Now, at that stage we had thought, upon reading the

3

Zschemig decision, because of the sweeping rationale of the

4

majority and the concurring opinion and the New York statute

5

being so similar to the.Oregon statute that that question was

6

put to rest»

7

That similar statutes which — such as New York

were unconstitutional because they were enacted in such a

8

fashion that they compel the courts to intrude into an area

9

that is the exclusive domain of the Federal Government.

10

Upon a hearing by the three-judge court, the three»

11

judge court found otherwise-.

The matter was heard before the

12

three-judge court on June 25

1968 and shortly before that the

13

New York Court of Appeals had occasion for the first time since

14

Zschernig to review the New Y&rk law in the light of the

15

Zschernig decision»

16

in both briefs, the matter of Leikind.

17

Hew York Court of Appeals felt that on the record of that case

18

there was no ..showing that the Hew York courts have engaged in

19

any of the activities that were proscribed by Zxchernig, and

20

felt that the statute of Hew York is not unconstitutional»

21

And that was the case which is mentioned
And in that case the

Well, this same conclusion was reached by the three-

22

judge court.

23

before it that there wasno showing that the Hew York courts

24

had engaged inthe activities proscribed by Zschernig.

25

The three-judge court felt that on the record

How, the matter of the — the three-judge court in

1

our case had the matter before it on a motion for summary

2

judgment.

The matter was filed before the decision in
■

' .«

3

Zschernig and after the decision of this Court in Zschernig

4

the Appellants filed a motion for summary judgment on the

5

strength of the conclusions that were to be drawn from

6

Zschernig.

1

the Appellants attached an affidavit in which set forth many

8

cases and instances which Appellants sought, to establish that

9

the Mew York courts in interpreting and construing the Mew York

And in support fox* that motion for summary judgment

10

statute, were, in effect, were engaging in activities pro­

11

scribed by Zschernig.

12

Mow, in the case of the Romanian interest, Greenberg

13

had established a precedent that as a result of the finding in

14

Greenberg that all othercourts followed Greenberg as holding

15

that the mere fact that you were a resident or citizen of

16

Romania thereby you were not entitled to have, your money be­

17

cause of that decision and the policy of the Sate of New York
in withholding these fund® from these Appellants.

18

Nwo, it is interesting that in Greenberg the three-

19

judge court, had determined that there was no showing that

20

any courts had engagedin any proscribed activities y©t„

21

The

Greenberg decision which was before the court, very clearly

22

shows that the court engaged in such proscribed activities.

23

In seeking to convince the court that the money should be

24

released, the parties — the Romanian plaintiffs in that case

25

i

1

had summoned the Chief of the Counsellors Section of the

2

Romanian delegation at that time to testify with refemece to

3

the inheritance laws of Romania and to the relevant laws with

4

reference to the problem at hand.

5

expertise in the matter, and testifying that there are no

6

restrictions, the Court refused to give any credence to the

7

testimony o* this expert who, according to my understanding

B

of that record,

9

And after establishing his

was not impeached in any way.

And moreover, the Court, in reaching its conclusion,

10

had to consider the foreign exchange control laws of Romania,

11

and in doing so the court found that it did not like the rate

12

of exchange thatthese citizens of Romania were receiving and

13

therefore.held that in effect, they were confiscatory and by

14

reason of that, that they would not have the use, benefit and

15

control of the funds.

18

This same position on the foreign exchange laws was

17

also taken by the Appellate Court which affirmed the decision

18

of the Surrogate and the Surrogate somehow, and 1 am not

19

familiar where the Surrogate came to the conclusion that

20

Romania leu, which is the Romanian currency, could be purchased

21

here in the United States and New York at a very high rate of

22

exchange; certainly very much higher than the official exchange

23

and that was the basis to conclude that since there was such

24

a discrepancy in that you can buy currency in New York and what

25

the official exchange is that therefore these people were not

7

1

2

getting all they were entitled to.

Now, I don't know where the Greenberg court had
My understanding

3

gotten the exchange of 31 and three-fourths.

4

of Romanian law does notpermit any of their currency to come

5

in from abroad.

6

tain, officially anywhsrs in the world, 31 and three-fourths

7

leu to a dollar presumably there is a black market in that

8

exchange, but I don’t see how a black market rate of exchange

9

could furnish the basis of a legal decision.

0

They do not sell it as far as I could ascer­

But in any event, we have other showings in the

11

affidavit in support of the'motion for summary judgment, showing

12

that the various attitudes of the state comptroller, who has

3

soma of these funds under his custody, and the courts, that

4

they have engaged in attitudes that certainly clearly are

5

proscribed by Zschemig.

6

Now, interestingly. enough, the only- authorities in

7

the United States that I have knowledge of, who still adhere

8

to this Iron Curtain statute and type lav? is the State of New

9

York and the Attorney General of Montana, that in my experience

20
21

22
23
24
25

in the last ten years in many of our other jurisdictions:
Floridat,Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey and Ohio and
Michigan all have statutes which I think are copied from the
New York statute which are substantially identical.

And all

of these jurisdictions and the courts in these jurisdictions
have not applied, their Iron Curtain statute to the rights of

8

1

Romanian interests once they were aware and ware acquainted

2

with the financial agreements of I960 between our country and

3

Romania, whereby our country has released all blocking controls

4

and restrictions of transmittal of public funds to Romania and

5

ever since.- then they have been sending such things as S.tcial

6

Security benefits and veteran’s pensions and other public funds

7

.tod more interesting, since Zschernig, the STate of

8

Oregon has held its statuta to be unconstitutional; California

9

in a recent appellate decision on October 9th of this year

.10

in California State of Kramer also follows Zschernig and said

3

that by reason of the holding in Zschernig that their statute

n

is unconstitutional.'

3

.Paid in Montana we have the situation in that Go run

4

case that was up before this Court and decided in January of

5

this year, where the Probate Court found that in view of

16

Zschernig and comparing the opinion of the court in Gorun

7

versus Fall, that there was no question that the statute cannot

8

be applied constitutionally and therefore did not follow it.

9

However, the Attorney General disagreed and presently

20

has filed an appeal to the Probate Court's decision; an appeal

21

to the Supreme Court of Montana.

22

Now, we have a recent decision from a three-judge

23

court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division,

24

which, to my knowledge is not reported, where an kidentical

25

action was filed challenging the Iron Curtain statute of Ohio
9

1

by certain Czechoslovakian heirs and the statute in Ohio is

z

substantially identical as the Hew York statute.,

3

custodial statute; it provides that the heir has the burden to

4

prove he has the use or control of — would have the use and

3

control of the funds or that circumstances — special circum­

0

stances in the country of his residence would not prevent him

7

from using and enjoying his property without confiscation in

8

whole or in part.

It's a

1 think that my position with reference to the New

10

14

15

Is that in your brief?

If yawa

want to have any reliance on it.

Well, the matter was unreported and I thought

we would be recorded and therefore I guess we overlooked it,

and we have not cited it in our brief.

action challenging the constitutionality; asking for the con­

25

vening of a three-judge court.

And in that they had thesame problem;

10

it is
the same

And that court, in striking

1

down and following Zschernig, stated it as follows:
"The so-called Iron Curtain statute, such as 211381,

2

j

3

that is the Ohio statute, ware recently considered by the

4

United States Supreme Court in Zschernig versus Miller." And

5

then it goes on to elaborate on the type of statute Oregon had,j

6

the three provisions.

;

'

i

j.

And then its opinion, the Court went on to say, and

7
8

I quote:

"In passing upon the validity of this statute the

9

Supreme Court considered the whole area of reciprocal inheri­

10

tance statutes.

11

12

The Court drew a distinction between recip­

permit the state court to launch inquiries into the type of
governments that obtain in a particular foreign nation.
Citing its earlier decision in Clark versus Allen,
the Court noted that state courts are not really precluded
from construing and applying laws of a foreign nation.

The

Court held, however, that where a statute permits inquiry into
the type o£ government existing into a foreign nation, or in t
the operation of that, government, or into the question of
whether the legal rights guaranteed by the nation are rights,
in fact, or into the question of whether statements by the
representative of foreign nations are credible or made in good
faithj or into the likelihood that the legatees will actually
receive the property left to them, such a statute so applied

11

1

intrudes intothe exclusive right of Congress to regulate for­

2

eign policy ."
Section 211381 Ohio revised coda , which is the

3
4

statute at issue in the present case, is somewhat different

5

from the Oregon statute involved in Zschernig.

6

statute requires the public court to determine whether or not

7

tiie foreign legatees will have the benefit or use or control

8

of the money left them because of circumstances prevailing at

9

the place of residence of such legatee..

10

In Ohio the

The Ohio statute thus appears to foe directed at an

u

inquiry into the operations of the foreign government and into

12

the political economic and social conditions prevailing in the

foreign country.

This type of inquiry is specifically pro­

hibited by the doctrine of Zschernig versus Hiller.
And we say that that exact language — that exact
argument is applicable to the New York statute here under review, foecuase this statute also pswldeis that if there are
special circumstances at the place of residence which would
make it appear that the party would not have the money, then
the court could withhold the funds.

Yes ? Your Honor,

B-a-t-t-e-n.

It was decided in July of

1969, but it, so far as I know, and as 1 have been able to
ascertain, it is unreported.
Now, insofar as this statute is concerned I think

12

this Court in the

13

©pinion mads it clear that the futility of the section that's

14

involved is that this statute is framed in such a manner that

15

compels the court to go into internal matters;, "to go into the

16

nature of the government, the policy of the government, the

17

laws of the government- and the laws of the government in re-

18

lafcion to their citizens and because these statutes are framed i

19

in such a way the conclusion is inescapable that these courts

20

are intruding into an area that is the exclusive domain of the

21

Federal Government.

22

Q

majority and Mr. Justice Stewart's concurring
i

Of course, Mr. Vintllla, in all modesty, you

23

can't really rely on a concurring opinion.

24

court opinion said, presumably it would not have been a

25

necessity for a concurring opinion to say something different.
13

If that's what the

A

1

Welly that is true, but we believe that the

2

majority opinion not so succinctly, not so directly, has said

3

about the same thing that these courts are injectedinto this

4

area whether they are caused to make these inquiries and to

5

make inquiries based on considerations which are’political in.

6

nature; which are in an area that involves the conduct of

7

8

foreign relations and because of that, this statute is uncon­
stitutional*
But haven’t the courts been dealing with the

9

10
11

operation of foreign laws, taking evidence, making findings on
the operation of foreign laws in other areas for many years?

Oh, yes; and they still do, but I think

Zschernig makes it clear 'that they still have a right to apply
and construe and the Maro case says so, but in our situation
they are not applying and construing; they’re going much further
The way the statute is framed, it’s even difficult to determine
what evidence you need to convince a court that they have the
use and benefit.

From all the cases — and the cases are

replete with examples where you bring an expert — you bring
an expert to testify; you have that case --we have a case in
New York in the matter of Draganoff involving a Bulgarian
heiress,

ted they brought a specialist — an attorney from

Bulgaria who specializes in civil family law and inheritance
in Sophia
lav; and a member of a firm/and this is what the court said with
reference to his testimony: "The Court cannot disregard the

to Iron Curtain countries.

As he was about, to return to

Mr. Vintilla, has the State Department shown

any interest in this case?
A

Well, the State Department is sometimes on

both sides.

12

Zschernig case and. —
A

Not in this case, Your Honor.

Q

Mot in your case?

A

Mo, not the present case.

13
14

Thera is a letter

15

that the State Department sent to Governor Rockefeller after
16
the financial agreement of 1960 requesting that he advise the
T7
Mew York authority that the Federal policy now permits the
18
transfer of funds to Romania and that, evidently, was ignored
IS
by the state authorities, the Surrogate judged and at the
20

same time we have had letters from the State Department saying
21

that this is purely a matter of a state law, the administration
22

says.
23
Q

Well, the reason I asked the question; my

24
recollection is — I may be wrong, but I think I’m correct.
25
15

1

that in the Zschemig ease they filed amicus briefs saying that

2

these laws and their administration had caused now embarrass­

3

Now, I'm wondering whether or not their point ©f view
had changed or whether you —

X*Je feel that the State Department is not injecting
itself directly, perhaps.

I think there have been some letters

to other attorneys, and I think there is an amicus brief that
they shall await the outcome of this particular problem before
the Court today.
But, I think that the reading of Zschernig — I
think that the reasonable conclusion to be drawn from that is
that New York enacted such a statute because it -dislikes the
paticular governmental systems and the policies of these
countries and that was New York's way of reacting in a hostile
fashion, saying well, you appropriate properties of our
nationals and you will have a system where you deny your
citizens the right to pri

-e property and because of that they

have enacted this statute to react, to say, "well, if you do
those things, we are going to withhold funds belonging to your
citizens and this type of conduct is the one that causes the
16

1

statute to be invalid because this is not a function of the

2

state.
If every state in our union would react in such a

3
4

fashion and go different ways on a purely international problem

5

we'd have chaos.
Q

6

Of course there would be no question of the

7

powerof Congress to step in and pass a law preventing the state!

3

from enacting these sorts of statutes; wouldn't it?
A

9

Well, Congress, certainly and the Federal
t

10

Government, this is an area that they can legislate.

Congress

12

Federal Government would certainly be overriding and certain

16

Gorun case and in which he was joined by Mr. Justice Harlan,

17

Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Fortas.

issues as have been presented by the pleadings here? in order to
to have determined the issue which is presented by these plead­
ings of whether New York statute which has under prior decisions:
been held to be valid on the state, determine -- have the threejudge court determine whether the statute is being applied in an
unconstitutional manner.
Now, this Court had before It a similar appeal from

The Attorney General was prepared

the denial ©£ a motion for summary judgment in Gorun against

And the Court, as 1 see it, pretty much unanimously

decided in that case that the summary judgment motion in ■—

on appeal from the Montana District Court had bees» properly
denied.

that there are actual* pending state court proceedings which
the complaint seeks to enjoin and despite the fact that as I
pointed out to this Court in the loannou case* which was before
this Court several years ago* that the orders of the Surrogate
Court are constantly open to the making of any application to
withdraw these funds so that* instead of coming intofche Federal
CenrtiR through the District Courts* through the three-judge

indicate that even at the time of the hearing before the three-

that were coming before the Mew York Surrogate directions were

being made to transmit funds conditioned in sonte cases with

15

The Cms»*t of Appeals for the State, of New York in the

they find that this record is inadequate to justify this

before the District Court, Mr. Vintilla was given the opportunity
to present evidence and did not.

whatever as to how Section 2218 has been applied in this case,

we are unable to say that it has been applied in such a way as

with this Court, I received a copy of a letter from an Assis­
tant Professor Marian A. Faldwell at Stetson University College
of Law, indicating that he had-

become familiar with this

18

case and had a strong interest in the final outcome hereO* ?
and had prepared an LLM thesis for his studies at George
Washington University Law School.

had duplicated and which I have left with the Clerk so that it
will be available for the Court.

sentences from the letter of transmission from Professor

Faldwill.

83In closing I wish you success, et cetera, et cetera.81
The reason that particularly I want to have this

22

thesis by a law professor before you is that in fact, most of

23

the testimony that has been adduced in various proceedings in

24

the New York Surrogate's Court in recent 3/ears has not been by

25

continental ambassadors- of representatives of foreign
29

?

governments, but the testimony has been that of a Professor

z

Meyer, Harvard Lav; School# who has been testifying on the basis>

3

of a fee of $500 per day for testimony, to show that in these

4

various Iron Curtain countries 'the persons who are named as

S

beneficiaries will actually receive the use, benefit and control

6

of the legacies which are involved.

7

Mow, the purpose of the New York statute is not

8

what the plaintiffs have stated it to be.

9

benefit: and control is something to see that the persons who,

10

when named in wills, persons who have been natural objects of

11

bounty who get distributed shares under the New York Distribu­

12

tion statutes, will actually receive their legacies or their

13

distributive shares.

14

The statute of use,

The statute on its face, contains no language which

15

might be considered any sort of animadversions,

16

the thesis which was submitted by Professor Faldwell will

17

indicate that probably a response to the Chief Judge's question,

18

many statutes which deal with problems of foreign law are

19

regularly treated by our courts but they are treated in a way

20

which does not require any animadversions,.

2!

any interference with foreign relations; that it is not

22

necessary for the disposition of this sort of ease to bring in

23

a foreign counsel and to place him in a disparaging position.

We were prepared to show that even before the dis­
position intthe Zschernig case that various Surrogates

throughout the state had, upon appropriate testimony, directed

3

them warranted such disposition <>

The monies involved there ware Hungarian monies, but the situa­

tion is no different from that involved in this Romanian case.
Now, we believe that New York, just like any other

litigant before this Court is entitled to due process.

where it had not actually been granted the hearing as to how

record in this case, dealing solely with the question of

whether the summary judgment should have been granted or denied

7

Thank you, Your Honors.

8

Q

9

Would you,-as you submit the case, the question

before us is really now.

That is whether or not the three-

10

judge district court was in error in failing and refusing to

11

grant a summary judgment at the behest of the plaintiffs and

12

that's it.
A

13
14

X don01 think it's necessary to pass upon any

other question at this stage of this litigation.
Q

15
16

Xt8s just that narrow issue?

But the question as to whether the statute

should be invalidated on its face.

19

valid on its face there wouldn't be any need for a trial?

Q
application
A

- Yes, you are right about that.
And you simply assert that Zschernig is an
gusstion rather than a —
Yes, Your Honor.
33

As the opinion was written in

1

Zschernig by Mr» Justice Douglas, he indicated that whan Clark

2

Allen was before this Court the only question before the Court

3

inCiark against Allen was whether the statute;

4

case was a statute which was valid on its face and it didn't

5

have before it the application of that statute.
And it seems to me that as an opinion is written the

6

7
8
9

opinion rests primarily with the relation to the misapplication
to the statute upon various Law Review articles which indicate
such misapplication.
Now, those Law Review articles, including the one

10
11

12

13
14
15
16
17

which is written by Mr. Meyer, are not the product of our
judicial system where you get into court and try a case where
you find out what actually happened. The mhn -- I said Meyer?
I meant Mr. Berman — the Berman articles are written by
somebody who hes been testifying at the rate of $500 per day as
an expert witness to sustain the position that has been put
forth in these various cases by Iron Curtain claimants.
Now, we believe that we are entitled to an opportunity

1:8

19
20
21

22

to not only contest Mr. Berman's testimony upon a trial, but
that possibly, as thorough a job as Mr. Justice Douglas did
in analysing Law Review articles at that time, but Perhaps
Mr. Justice Harlan did his homework better.
