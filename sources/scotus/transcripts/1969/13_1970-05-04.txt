ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

We move now to No., 13 for

MR. AMSTERDAM;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The Court is thoroughly familiar with this case,

9

which has been the subject of one prior oral argument here and

16

of voluminous briefing by the parties and various amici curiae.

ii

As I see the matter, there are at this time four questions

12

before the Court.

13

The first two are the questions on which this Court

14

granted certiorari in December of 1968;

15

the Arkansas practice of giving its juries unlimited, ungui dec.,

16

and unreviewable power to sentences persons convicted of rape

17

to live or die violates the rule of law fundamental to the

18

due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

12

the Arkansas practice of trying simultaneously, in a capital

20

case, the issues of guilt, and of punishment also violates the..

21

Fourteenth amendment.

22

jargon of this case are known respectively as the standard

23

issue and the single verdict issue.

24
25

Number 1) Whether

2) 'Whether

Those are the questions which in the

The third question is one which arises from this
Courtes decision in Boulden vs. Holman.

In that case, as in

this one, a state prisoner condemned to death brought a federal

The split verdict issue

would potentially

affect, to the best of ray calculations — and this is very-

15

rough «—• 380 to 390 of the 510 man on death row.

16

Mr. Justice Stewart, is, of course, because several of the

17

states including those with major death row populations, such

18

as California, have split verdicts, so that the number is

19

very significantly reduced.

And this,

How many states have split verdicts?

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Justice Brennan,

24

out how many men are involved.

Connecticut, New York, California, Pennsylvania ~ and

Q

How long has New York had it?

4

A

New York put it in, 2 believe, as a result of the

S

interim report of the committee whose final report led to

6

abolition, and that would have been back around 1965.

That Texas statute is the one we noticed —

peripherally, perhaps —- in Spencer, wasn't it?
A

1 think the split verdict for capital trials

wasn't involved in Spencer.

15

sentencing in capital cases.

Texas, since Spencer, has revised

One other area that 1 think I want to bring to the

17

Court’s attention in connection with the question of what

18

issues it should reach comes from experience of about five

19

years in dealing with these cases.

£0

this Court granted review in Maxwell vs. Bishop, the job of

21

getting stays of execution for condemned men. was an incredibly

22

difficult, perilous job.

23
24
25

Prior to the time when

On occasions courts would stay executions.

Occasion”

ally, we would have to come to -the Justices of this Court to
get stays of execution a day, 2 days, before the execution dates

7

s

were set., as we did in this Maxwell Case»
Since the grant of review in Maxwell vs. Bishop, it

z
3

has been far easier to get courts to be willing to stay an

4

execution

until this Court finally disposed of the issues in

5

this case.

The question of getting stays of execution is a

S

vital one, literally, of course, but also a troublesome one,

7

because many of the men on death row are still not represented,

8

ted those of us who are trying to represent them very often

9

don’t learn until the last minute that an execution date has

10
11

been set.
Since Maxwell v. Bishop was brought before this

12

Court, the governors of several states—Arkansas, Massachusetts,

13

Washington--have agreed to hold up all executions in their

14

states, pending decision of these issues by this Court.

15

However, if this Court should dispose of the Maxwell

16

vs. Bishop Case on a ground which does not resolve the

17

standards and the single verdict issues, and if it does not

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

simultaneously grant review on those issues in one of the other
pending cases, the problem of getting stays of execution will
not foe even what it was before the grant of review in Maxwell
vs. Bishop? it will be far worse.
The

reason for that is this?

j
That in recent, years,

and, in most part, since the grant of review in Maxwell vs.
Bishop, the highest courts of 17 states — including the states
with the 8 largest death row populations in this country —

5

likely be available.

There are on the

ment?

13

that is simply a pragmatic answer.

That is I am not treating

14

states which have it for treason but don't use it.

15

What this means, in effect, is that if ever there

16

were an issue of grave national importance, it is the issue

17

presented in the questions on which this Court granted review

IS

in this case in December of 1968.

m

It may well be that the constitutional contentions

20

raised by Maxwell and by these other condemned men are not

21

going to be sustained, but 1 would only ask that this Court

22
23

24
25

pass upon those issues, in this case or in another, before the
executions which will surely follow.
Q

If only -'the split verdict issue were determined

and. not the standards issue, what then would be the situation?
9

1

A

If the split verdict issue , and not the standards

2

issuesi were decided, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would estimate

O

that there would be 130 men on death row in, principally, 3

4

states — the other 2 states that have split verdict don't

5

have very many men on death row — but -there would be approx­

6

imately 130 men in three states who would still go to their

7

death with the issue of standards unresolved.

8

Q

Which would be California and —-?

9

A

California, which has 85-90'men on death row,

10

Pennsylvania, which has 20 men on death row, and whatever number
.

11

in Texas were tried under the new split verdict decision.
Mr. Amsterdam, would it be fair to say that your

Q

12
13

burden here is not to persuade us that the trial of split

14

verdict and the standards to guide the jury are a wise and a

15

sound thing, but that the Constitution requires -that they be

16

provided?

17

That is the narrow issue, isn't it?
A

Mr. Chief Justice, I am asserting only that

18

the Constitution compels the procedure providing standards of

IS

soma sort to guide a jury in its discretion, and

20

requires some form of trial — not necessarily the single

21

verdict trial, that is a matter for the state to decide what

22

procedure it wants to use — but that the Constitution requires

that it

23

some form of trial which does not whipsaw a capital defendant

24

between his privilege against self-incrimination and his right

25

to provide the jury with adequate information to make an informed
10

1

sentencing choice.

2

I want to make that very plain, because I think in

3

the last oral argument I failed to do so, and I am not at all

4

clear we have done so in the briefs.

5

as a case which poses any new-fangled notions of due process

8

or any notions of an expanding, collapsing concept of due

7

process into which I am asking the Judges of this Court to

8

pour their own penological judgments.

9

and that is not this kind of due process.

10

1 do not regard this case:

That is not this case,

The kind of due process that is involved in this

11

case is the most fundamental, basic, traditional, classic

a requirement of lawfulness.

And, Mr. Chief Justice, it is our assertion

13

not that

18

the procedures we are urging are better procedures, or more

17

humane procedures, or

19

that some of the procedures that we are arguing for might

20

be worse for defendants.

and. worse histories would be worse off if there were standards

That is what, the procedure we are challenging in

If I may focus in on that procedure and talk then

5

first about the standards question.

6

of a misconception in the approach to the jury sentencing in

7

capital cases which suggests that what -the jury is doing in

8

a death case is to exercise some sort of clemency, or mercy,

9

or,

SO

I think there is something

as Mr. Harris called it in the last argument here, compas­

sion.
I think that an examination both of the practice in

11
12

Arkansas and elsewhere and of the statutes in Arkansas and

13

elsewhere make very clear that the kind of determination that

14

is being made when juries choose between the penalties of life

15

and death, it is a very different business than the release of
:

IS

some few people from what is otherwise a mandatory,, or even

17

a normal, punishment for the offense for which they have been

18

convicted.

19

20

What the statute in Arkansas does is not to make
j
death the penalty for rape; it is not to make death the penalty j

21

for any and all varieties of rape, or even for some special

22

varieties of rape.

23

an equally available penalty of life imprisonment.

24
25

Q

It is to make it an available penalty, with

When did Arkansas put the death penalty in the

hands of the jury?

12

<5»

A

In 1915, Mr. Justice Harlan.

2

Q

And before that, Mr. Amsterdam?

8

A

Before that it was mandatory.

4

Q

A mandatory death sentence.

S

A

That is correct.

6

Q

And that, typically, is historically the fact

7

in most of these states, is it not, that the states moved from

8

a mandatory death sentence upon, conviction of first degree

9

murder, or in this ease rape, moved from a mandatory death

10

sentence upon conviction to giving the jury discretion to avert

11

that death sentence in their verdict?

12

the way this developed in most of the states?
A

13

Isn't that historically

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart? if there were any

14

states that didn't follow that course, 1 don't know of them.

15

The ordinary practice in every state that I know of was exactly

16

that? that after the mandatory death penalty became, for some

17

.reason, intolerable or impossible to maintain, legislatures,

18

instead of attempting to define sub-classes of cases in which

19

it might be permissible to sentence a man to death, simply said

20

.'let the jury have it, the jury can decide.
I am tucking nothing under the rug.

O

takes affirmative action of jury * nowadays, to impose the

6

called recommendation of mercy will be — it will foe to convert

so on.

In some states it

In soma states it is verbalised in terms —-

But basically the historical pattern or development

10

is as I described it, is it not?
A

11

That is right.

The differences are matters of

12

detail.

constitutional purposes, such as the detail as to whether ox-

14

no t the. judge may review -die jury's determination.

15

a general, overall description of the kind of institution we

16

are talking about, we are talking about one that in virtually

17

all states is the same and involves exactly the process that

18

Your Honor has described.

19

The matters of detail, I may add, may be critical for

Q

Is that also true, Fir. Amsterdam, in the non­

death cases?

21

relatively recent?

25

A

But for

Is jury sentencing in other cases likewise

Ho, Your Honor.

There is jury sentencing in

non-capital cases in a number of states.

I am not a student of

this, but my impression is they are largely southern states.
Arkansas is one such state.
14

fk
2

Q

Is that practice older than jury sentencing

in death cases?

3

A

My belief is that it is, but I would not be sure

4

of that.

5

It is true in penology, generally, that the law has moved from

6

mandated, legislatively fixed sentences for specified crimes

7

to a range of sentences available for 'the crime.

S

quite sure that it was in the process of that the juries were

9

given discretion in the states in which they now have it.

!G

whether it came earlier or later than the development in

it

capital cases, I am not sure, because there are so many other

12

devices in non-capital cases that came in too:

13

judge a range of sentences, a maximum and minimum, the indet­

14

erminate sentence, all of those things.

15

historically when that came in.

16

There is a parallel development, Mr. Justice White.

Q

Mow I am

But.

giving the

I am not sure

Mr. Amsterdam, it is only about ten years

17

ago that Congress, as the legislative body for the District of

18

Columbia, abolished mandatory capital punishment and

19

created a mechanism somewhat like the one you have described,

20

the more flexible one, is that not. true?

21

A

That is right.

The District of Columbia was one 1

22

of the last 3 jurisdictions in this country to have a mandatory

23

death penalty.

24

penalty for murder.

25

penalties on 'the books, but they simply are not used,

Again, I am talking about a mandatory death
There are still some mandatory death

15

And

1

the reason they are on the books is that not being used, that

2

•there is no pressure to take them off.
Q

3

For purposes of this argument, it doesn't make

4

any difference, or does it, in your view, what the crime is,

5

but only what the punishment?
A

6

Isn't that true?

Let me put it this way, Mr. Chief Justice, I

7

had no hesitation in contending that any time that a legislature

8

gives a jury completely arbitrary powers to single out from

9

among the total number of people convicted of any crime soma

10

who will live and some who will die without standards for that

11

determination, without guide lines, that it does violate the

12

Constitution.

13

crimes.

But I could see a distinction being drawn between

14

I would not draw it, but I would urge that in this

15

case, the case of rape, you have a somewhat easier case than

16

you do of first degree murder.

17

the

18

saying discretion;

19

amount of raw, naked power to take a life or save a life that

20

can be given may depend on the range of cases within which the

21

jury can exercise it.

22

And the reason for that is that

amount of discretion that may be tolerable — I keep
it isn't discretion in any legal sense-- the

Now what is rape is a very broad range of offenses.

23

It ranges from anything, from a fellow and a girl, who have

24

been going together, getting into a situation and he going to

25

far for resistance, to a brutal beating of a child with permanent
16

«
I

physical injury or a torture rape or something like that.

Z

is just a tremendous range of factual situations encompassed

There

within the notion of rape.
4

So that the idea that the offense of rape sets any

5

limitation, or gives any guidance, to the jury is just totally

©

chimerical.

7

which convictions of rape come down an infinite variety of

8

factual circumstances.

9

There are within the total gamut of cases in

Now the theory seems to be that the jury somehow —

fO

that 12 men brought off the street, who have never sentenced

11

anybody else and will never sentence anybody else again, who

12

have no way of making the judgment passed in this case consis­

13

tant with judgment that has been passed or will be passed on

14

any other human being convicted of this crime ~ that they

1,5

somehow will look at all the facts of this case, coma out with

16

circumstances that warrant the death penalty and impose it.

17

Q

Is that any different from the traditional

IS

function of the jury which passes on the damages in an auto­

19

mobile accident case or breach of contract

20

before or never again will deal with that kind of a problem?

Yes, it is vastly, vastly different.

A relatively recent' innovation.

25

It takes 3

different forms which one has to watch out for, but I don't
22

1

think they make much difference.

2

this is the Maryland situation. —~ the judges charge with

follows the jury.

One is that the judges —

Then the third is a form that is a little older,

but still I think largely a recent innovation that says that

imposed.
Wow it is that latter form that is very difficult tc

what is done and what these experiments and innovations have

my whole position is that they ought to do that.

19

or that this Court ought to review any legislative judgment.

20

No legislative judgment has been made, except the legislative

2!

judgment that no judgment can be made.

22

I am asking this Court to determine whether it is

23

consistent with the rule of law which is fundamental to due

24

process for a legislature to say, "We are going to kill people,

25

.and we are not going to undertake an investigation to determine

I can see the benefits of legislative judgment here.

7

And a ruling by this Court that lawlessness in the process of

8

killing people is unconstitutional will precisely put back

9

to the legislature the kind of question that it is uniquely

10

fitted to deal with.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I have indeed, and 1 do.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe that the Court will not

10

be setting its foot on a primrose path if it demands that the

11

States set some standards for the penalty determination.

~i2
13
14

I be­

lieve that statutes are draftable which will provide adequate
constitutional standards.
I say that in view of two major considerations.

First {

15

I think we already have some models.

16

Renal Code, model for a capital punishment statute, although I

17

might not agree with all of its details, is a workable model.

IS

I think that the ALI Model

Secondly, again, I would like to advert, if I may, to

19

the history of the Court's experience in dealing with ordinances

20

that regulate parades and that sort of thing.

21

may have been arguable and it might have looked very plausible

22

before this Court's decision in 1938 in Lovell and Griffin that

23

said that you could not draft an ordinance that would take accou: it

24

of all of the imponderables that have to do with the question of

25

whether or not you ought to let a parade go down a street.

.

Hampshire in 1941.
The fact that there has been 30 years experience in
which this Court has had to knock down various ordinances for

n

lack of standards is not because it was impossible to draft

12

standards but simply because there was a willful refusal to com­

13

ply with what this Court demanded.

14

|

I say willful adxdeedly because the considerations tha:

15

kept openhanded discretion in the hands of police chiefs to

IS

regulate parades is very much the same thing that is being given

17

to juries in capital punishment.

18

There is simply a feeling that,, if you really brought

1©

up to the surface and articulated the considerations that

20

legislature was intending to affect juries like race, they

21

wouldn8t stand the light of day.

22

I think that it is possible to draft a statute which

23

will withstand the constitutional scrutiny of this Court,

24

I think that an insistence by.this Court that the legislature

25

address itself, turn its undoubtedly greater wisdom and its

And,

1

undoubtedly more appropriate penalogical judgment to that ques­

2

tion will advance the cause of the drafting of adequate statutes

3

1 thinJc that if this Court hadn’t decided in Lovell and Griffin

4

that it was necessary the legislatures never would have tried.
Now that they have tried, they have succeeded.

S

I thin

that if this Court insists that the rule of lav? requires the

7

drafting of standards in this area that it will be possible to

8

do.

9

tions about the details of it and although it is applicable to

10

murder and not to rape, is a fair example of what legislatures

11

can do if they try.

12

I think that the Model Penal Code, although X had some ques

There is, though, a second answer to that question.

13

If I were to conclude -that if was impossible to draft a statute

14

which would impose the rule of lav? on the decision whether or

15

not a man should live or die so that it was impossible to recone: ,1<

16

the basic requirement of lawfulness in proceedings with the death

17
18

19

penalty, I have no doubt which of the two institutions the con­
stitution said should prevail.
If the cost of a system of capital punishment is law­

20

lessness in its administration, the constitution forbids that

21

kind of lawlessness.

22
23
24
25

And, that causes me to revert to what I

think is essentially wrong with Arkansas procedure for determin­
ing who lives and who dies in a capital case.
That is a decision, as I have said, which is not -the
dispensation of mercy.

On this record, it appears that less than.

Why can't they draw that inference?

19

A

Because we have examined the factors that bring

20

about death verdicts in the State of Arkansas, and we have not

21

found that any of the characteristics that you or I or 12 jurors

22

could agree made those casesbad cases, in fact bring about the

death verdict.

Are you saying that that never enters into the matters

What would you say where the death penalty is put

in the hands of the sole discretion of the judge?

Would you

say standards are necessary there too?
§
A

10

Mr, Justice Harlan, I would say that the consti­

tution forbids arbitrary discretion in the hands of the judge as
li
it does with the jury.

12
But, again, I can see a distinction between -the two

13
cases, and 1 believe that a holding with regard to juries would

14
not necessarily apply with regard to judges.

Again, I do not

15
think Gi&ccio vs. Pennsylvania, ’Which says that a jury can't have
16
an utterly free hand in setting costs means that the judge doesn‘ t

37
have a free hand in setting costs in a case»

1 think that the

IS
fact that you have 12 men brought in for a particular occasion
19
who are not professional senfencers who do not have even the

20
consistency of -their own performance from case to guide them
21
creates a different background for the sxerci.se of that discre­

22
tion.

Therefore, it may b@ constitutionally impermissible to

23
give it to a jury but not to a judge.

24
My own view is that it is equally bad to give it to

25
a judge, but 1 don't think that issue is presented in this case.

That is what you say, but 1 wonder how you would

really rationally distinguish the death case from the non-capi­

On several grounds, the most significant one, 1

10

think, is simply that where more is at stake for the defendant

Here you have got possibly life imprisonment, the

range of penalty from one year to life, say, and no standards

whatsoever to guide a jury in jury sentencing States or a judge,

if lie has sole discretion.

22

A

Mr. Justice White, my own personal position, again,

23

would be that standards are required of juries and of judges

24

in non-capital sentencing under the constitution.

25

But, 1 think that since Skinner and Oklahoma it has

tz

the equation when you talk about capital sentences and that is

14

the rehabilitative aspect.

15

When you are talking about non-capital sen­

Now, I am not asserted — I will make this very clear

16

that the constitution requires that States fake rehabilitation

17

into account in their sentencing.

18

ly States do take rehabilitation into account for the simple fact

19

that ,if you send a fellow away to prison he is going to coma out

20

and everybody wants him to come out better rather than worse

21

from the point of view of society,.

Z2

1 air asserting that inevitab­

We simply do not have the calibers at. this stage of

23

the science to reduce the rehabilitation factor to categorical

judgment which permit themselves to be articulated in standards.

25

When yon make the decision, however, to sentence a man to die
37

1

£
3
4

instead of to live, you are making the decision to take him out
of the rehabilitation regime entirely and that kind of standard,
it seems to me, can’t borrow the benefit of what we don't know
about reh abi11tation„

5
6
7

I think that, again, non-capital sentencing has a fac­
tor.

It has wild card.

It has a joker that justifies •——

So, you would say that in the non-capital cases j

the State simply came out and said our theory and punishment is >

without any standards at all?

Again, Mr. Justice White -—*

14

the Court could say that where rehabilitation is an issue that

a great of tolerance would be allowed because of the imprecision

of the art of sentencing in the light of rehabilitation.

That would he sort of like saying make up your mind what
is as a reasonable man.

It would be midway between due care and what we

have in capital sentencing because at least the focus would be

on something, rehabilitation,

You think that standards would help avoid that

Do you think if you drafted

16
a set of standards and permit the jury to sentence, you think

\7
those standards would really get you far along the line on —
18
A

Yes, Mr. Justice White, for two reasons.

First

19

of all, I am not only talking about the kind of discrimination
20.

that occurs from perverse and willful disregard of a legal re­
21

quirement.
22
In Arkansas a juror might believe that it is legal
23
and permissible under the charge he is given to take account of
24
the fact that the defendant is black and that the victim is white.
25
40

Is that all that would be necessary to eliminate

The reason for that is this.

[

I think that juries may j

The only way in which a judge can determine whether

There is no doubt that if all the other factors which

Perhaps you had better address yourself to that

You are practically out of time.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you and I

I simply would want to inquire whether there is also

u

any purpose in addressing myself to the Witherspoon point.

think the Witherspoon point Is open and shut on this record, and

is

I would prefer to, unless the Court has questions,in connection

17

19

Q

20

I

j

Seven

If you don't get any questione, you can assume

that it can be submitted on the brief.

21

A

Fine.

22

Now, again, with regard to the split-verdict issue

23

I want to make very clear that we are not relying on some general

24

notion of fairness which is to be spelled out of the due preoce-s

25

clause of the constitution.

We are .relying in this case on what ,
-

42

-

1

I think, is a palpable inconsistency between the Federally pro­

2

tested privelega against self-incrimination of the defendant

3

and his equally protected set of Federal constitutional rights

4

in assuring a rational sentencing decision.

5

Those latter rights include a right to a hearing on a

6

question which is as considerable as the question of life or

7

death and the opportunity to present defensive evidence address©

a

to that question.

9

In a single-verdict trial, a defendant who, like

io

William Maxwell, exercises his constitutional privelege against

11

self-incrimination allows the jury to decide whether he shall

12

live or die without presenting the slightest bit of evidence rel

13

vant to the choice of life or death except, except the evidence

14

that comes in on the guilt issue.

15

Now, again, I am not asserting and it is not the basis

16

of our constitutional submission that a State is constitutionslljf

17

precluded from permitting the decision as to life or death to be

m

made or the facts of the offense.

19

the State of Arkansas does not do that.

20

the State of Arkansas permits the decision as to life or death,

21

to be made on a broad bias is, including background information

22

and any other material that may in the unfettered discretion cf

23

the jury effect its choice.

24
25

If the State does that, but
It is very clear that,

This means that a defendant is paid £ very high price
for giving up the privelege against self-incrimination.
43

If he

chooses either to plead guilty and limit the trial to the issue
1

2
3

of punishment or to take the stand., raise the whole question of
background, talk to the jurors, show them that he is a human be­
ing, show them that, he has a voice, explain what led him to what

4
he did, and ask for mercy in light of those considerations, he
5
stands a far better chance that the decision will be made on a

6
full and rational basis than if he- simply exercises his privelage

7

a

and does not testify.
Q

Have you considered this question of bifarcated

0

io

trial as you all have been calling it from the point of what
might loosely be called the right of allocution, whether in the

n
technical sense- of that term or whether in the sense of, as it

tz

has developed in some States at least, a right to put in evidence
n
in litigation that is not relevant to the issue of guilt?

I

‘14
didn't see anything in your brief that touched that.

15
A

I am sorry, Mr. Justice Harlan, we do see the

16
right of allocution as sort of a comprehensive .summary, of What
17
we think the constitution entitles a defendant to in a capital

18

'

case.

Again, we don't quarrel with the observations of this

!9
Court in Hill, that in certain kinds of cases allocution may not

20
arise to constitutional dimensions.

What we say is that in a

21
capital case where allocution has been historically recognised

22
as far more significant, where more is at stake for the defen­

23
dant, where the practise not only precludes, as the Arkansas

24
practise does, his talking to the jury but his presenting any

25
44

»

evidence or his counsel even meaningfully arguing that issue in
1

2

light of & full record that the constitution does require more
allocution than the Arkansas procedure allows to a fellow who

3
4

claims his privelege„
Q

Arkansas has got a general allocution statute»

5

How does it operate in these capital casas where the jury and
€

not the judge fixes the penalty?

7
A

It does not.

Q

Does it have any at all?

8
9
A

There is no right of allocution in a capital case

10
The issue is submitted to the jury on , both guilt and punish­
11

ment after trial of the guilt phase»

The defendant has no oppor­

12

tunity to make a statement either of technical allocution nor to
13
present any evidence that goes to sentencing as such after verdic to
14
Now, he might present evidence relevant to sentencing
15

before a verdict with all of that implies to giving up the pri­
16

velege against self‘“incrimination and prejudicing himself on the
17
guilt issue»
18

Q

I was just coming to that on another form of

19

Justice Harlan's question; namely, would it solve your purposes,
20
would it meet your problems if the defendant could either tinder
21
oath or not under oath be permitted to address himself by his
22

own testimony, by his own statements to the question of mitiga­
23

tion and then apply the familiar rule that cross-examination
24

would be limited to the scope of the direct testimony in the
23
single trial?

This gets out, I think, perhaps what Justice
45

-

I

Harlan 'was probing at in terras of a right to speak to the jury.

2

A

It would help, but I don't think it would satisfy

3
<£.*

the constitutional requirement because there would still be —

4

I don't know what such a rule would do for impeachment, for

3

example, because I assume that his credibility would in issue

6

with regard to even those factors that he spoke simply going to

7

mitigation.

8

Q

Do you think it should net be an issue?

0

A

I think that it should he an issue, most assuredly.

10

Therefore, if he were permitted to make such a statement after

n

the jury had determined guilt, I would have no problem.

12

the difficulty is that in/Arkansas impeachment involves the

18

admission against the defendant of literally every bad act in

14

his life.

15

But,

I think that, again, the tension that is created that

16

would persuade the defendant not to take the stand, to give up

17

his right to speak in mitigation because of the tremendously

18

prejudicial impact, of that on the guilt phase would be consti­

19

tutionally intolerable.

20

v

However, tin at, again, is not this case and although

2!

I would have my constitutional doubts about, that, the Court

22

doesn't even have to reach that question.

23

question of standards, what we have here is an Arkansas procedure

24

which permits arbitrariness and irrationality by giving no stan­

25

dards to the jury in sentencing and then virtually requires that
-

46

Again, as in the

1

the decision be arbitrary, if the defendant doesn’t take the stand

2

because there is simply no basis for the jury3s determining the:

j

facts relevant to that critical sentencing decision.
Mow, any of those factors could change and we have

4

5

a different constitutional case•

6

the irrational trial process at its worst.

7

If I may reserve

S

Q

9

What we have in Arkansas is

If I may ask you one question before you leave

this phase of the argument, does Arkansas permit the State itself,

10

as distinguished from the defendant, to introduce in this case ir

11

chief evidence that is relevant to sentencing but would not be

12

admissible on the issue of guilt?

13

A

No, Mr. Justice Harlan.

14

Q

It does not permit that?

15

A

No, and that is what creates the constitutional

16

17

dilemma,

if the State could do that whether or not the defen­

dant testified, then you would not have the tension between

18

constitutional rights but the defendant subjects himself to that

19

only if ha makes character an issue or if he testifies.

ment of this therefore becomes very difficult because you don’t

lable the record as one way or the other?

20

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

21

The decision of the District Court on standards held

£2

that the United States Constitution did not make it necessary

23

to trial courts in Arkansas charge or instruct juries regarding

24

standards or guidelines to guide them in assessing life or

25

death.
51

1

The Court reasoned that Arkansas procedure rested the

1

decision in the discretion of the jury to be exercised in the

3

light of judgment, common sense and experience of the jurors aid

4

that the jurors are presumed to be persons of good judgment and

S

common sense.

We advance that argument here today also.

s

On the single-verdict procedure, the District Court

7

held that while some States may have split verdicts, no court

8

has held or it does not think it is constitutionally required

&

that any court have a split verdict.

The decision of the Court

10

of Appeals went along the same line.

It rejected the petitioner

11

Can you waive

They

jury trial in a capital case in

Arkansas?
A

No, Your Honor, you cannot.

If you plead guilty,

a jury would have to be impaneled and the State puts on a prima
facie case.
Q

Of guilt?

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

And what do you about penalty?

If there is a

plea of guilty and then there is a jury convened, do you have to
put on a prima facie case of guilt, but does ifc go any further
in that case than it does if there is a bona fide trial in terms
of the factors that go into penalty?
A

Ordinarily the trial would be very short and ifc

would probably be the fact that in a murder case a murder has
occurred and that the defendant has confessed to it.
Q

How do you view Arkansas1J theory of punishment

in this kind of a case?

Is i.t that the jury must decide the

penalty based on the facts of the crime only?

53

I suppose, or at

least the facts that come out in connection with the deciding

2

of guilt or innocence?

I think those factors are quite enough for a

jury to make an intelligent decision.

should confine itself to that?

in felonies only in cases where the jury cannot,

agree, then he can set the punishment.

What they have -—■

And when he so, do you have pre-sentence reports?

A

No, Ybrr Honor, we do not.

Q

You just go on the record that is made on de­

ciding guilt or innocence?
A

That is correct.

What happens is the jury goes

out and decides guilt and than it reports back to the judge that
it has decided on guilt or innocence but cannot reach a verdict
on punishment and then the judge takes the verdict of guilty and
then he sets the punishment within statutory limit.
Q

And all he knows is what is in the transcript?

A

What he has heard is what the jury has heard.

Q

So there are no pre-sentence reports in Arkansas?

A

There is a stattute in Arkansas that whenever a

person is sentenced to the penitentiary that, there will be —

Yes, Your Honor.
What were those facts that caused the jury that

must have had something to do with the sentencing to death?

set aside a death verdict whenever there is not enough evidence
to support it.

But, just ordinarily they can't do like this

statute here says.

They have said that they, themselves, do not

have the paver unless -the evidence is not enough to support a
change in the death penalty.

That is contrary to the weight of the evidence?

sentences only on the record that is made in determining guilt
or innocence?
A

That is correct.

On the single-verdict procedure, the way I gathered
from petitioner's argument he was saying either, one, he would
have a separate penalty trial with the same jury, or, two, he
would have a separate jury for penalty, or, three, that he would
have the judge set the penalty after a hearing and allocution.»
We submit -that this Court has never held that any
State should have to have a double jury, have a double hearing
on this particular aspect of the case.

Petitioner did not take the stand, did he?

That is correct.

In Arkansas it

I would

like to clarify one point because of the national implications

that were made clear by Mr. Amsterdam, and that is another

17

reason why we are here.
In California there is a process by which the judge

19

can pass

20

absolute discretion without reference to any formal standards

21

that the jury is supposed to exercise -- when there is a

22

death penalty.

it to a life sentence, and there it is, forevermore, a life

Is there a summing up to the jury by counsel for

There is very commonly a very protracted summing

Full argument on both sides, and then at that point

19

the case is submitted to the jury.

20

Q

Under what kind of instructions?

21

A

Well, tiie instruction is based, basically,

22

upon the statute, and in light of Mr. Amsterdam’s remarks this

23

morning about the lack of legislative determination of soma

24

of these problems, I took a look at our statute, which is

25

Section 190.1-of the Penal Code.
79

A rather long section, but it

5

he produced at the penalty trial of the circumstances surround­

6

ing the crime, of the defendant's background and history, and

7

of any facts and aggravations or mitigation of the penalty.,

8

The determination — and this is what they say to

the jury and to the judge? this is what our legislature has

They are not left in the dark

It is provided, specifically, that evidence may

Now I think it is clear that this does not anticipate

15

any kind of an arbitrary judgment by the jury or the judge.

16

or the jury is to make the decision on the evidence presented.

17

Q

What sort of instruction is that?

He

Does the

18

I believe that is true, yes, sir.

That, is not

13

dimensions, in any way, to bar this kind of procedure.

14

And it is not uncommon to

And the Court has found nothing of constitutional

We think that leaving to the jury the opportunity

15

to extend mercy to a man who is convicted of a crime potentially

16

involving capital punishment is simply an application of fitting

17
18

the punishment to the offender and not to the crime.
Not only is there nothing wrong with that, and 1

19

think there is general agreement among people who knew about

20

•these things, that this is what science has taught us, this

is what every thing we have learned has taught us.

capital sentencing is very typical of other sentencing in that

We think

There are alternative provisions.

A

Yes.

But he cannot do more than that?

14

A

No, he can't do any more than that.

15

I think we have to look to what is it that a state

16

should do, and what should the Federal Government do, if what

17

we do now is wrong, in terms of standards — and I am not

18

talking now about the single verdict — but in terms of stand­

ards, if what we are doing now is wrong, what is it we should

do?

very carefully, at least in noting what was not forbidden in

other state.

13

A

Yes, sirl7 it does.

14

Q

Does that indicate that there are more executions

15

16

in California than in other states according to the population?
A

I don't know about the statistics over time.

17

think that, -the accumulation at the moment is due to the stays

18

over the last. 8 years.

There is no doubt about that.

Q

I

Talking about standards, the basic standard,

8

of course, for any crime is the definition of the crime.

You

9

have a definition in your state, for instance, for rape.

How

10

I could assume that there is no purpose for standards except

11

to try to divide up the types of crime with reference to their

12

atrocity, -their ruthlessness, the defendant’s past experience.

13

But can you think of any way, as an attorney general, that you

14

could do 'that without simply saying you have got to divide

IS

the crime of rape up into a number of different crimes of

'16

different degrees, according to the circumstances?

17

A

I think you have to redefine the crime and say,

18

in effect, we will only allow the death penalty in a smaller

19

class of cases, as Your Honor said, in certain kinds of rape or,

20

by the same token, in murder.

21

here that the State of California here has gone too far in

22

defining first degree murder or have brought in cases that

23

constitutionally cannot be brought in.

24
25

There has been no suggestion

And as X understand

this argument goes, if the State of California said, "Humane

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM

10

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. AMSTERDAM:

11

I would like to speak to 3 questions

of Arkansas law that cams up and not reopen constitutional

13

questions.

question, we have dealt at pages 66-69 of our brief with the

kind of evidence that comas in for impeachment and that sort

of thing.

First, with regard to Mr. Justice Brennan's

7

jury had to be unanimous in Arkansas.

8

9

I want to make clear that it has to be unanimous either way.

10

It is not the kind of situation you have in California where

11

one juror can prevent the death penalty.

12

the jury is discharged, and they try the case again.

13

The answer that Mr.
But

If the jury hangs,

That also, I want to make clear, tends to point the

14

way to construction of this statute, that Mr. Langston has

15

twiced mentioned, this 432310, which he says gives trial

m

courts the power to set aside verdicts on the ground that they

n

find outrageous, or soma such thing, a jury death verdict.
To start with, I don't think the statute allows that.

«8

19

It pre-dates the 1915 statute which created discretion in

20

capital cases and would ssem to apply in non-capital cases only.
There is another statute which the Court might

21

as

want to take a look at,

23

when a jury finds a verdict of guilt and fail to agree on the

24

432306, which provides that

punishment, or do not declare such punishment, then the judge

.

25

renders judgment.
