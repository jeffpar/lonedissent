ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M, FRIEDMAN, ESQ.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.
This is a direct appeal from the District Court to the
District of New Jersey from a judgment of the District Court

fQ

there which after trial dismissed a Government civil anti-trust

II

suit challenging the merger of two banks in the town of Phillips-

tz

burg, New Jersey, as violating Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

u

The appeal presents a number of important questions as

14

to the standards to be applied by the Courts in passing upon the

15
16

application of Section 7 to small bank mergers and also to the
correction of certain rulings made by the District Court in this
case in upholding the community-and-convenience-needs defense

that Congress wrote into the Bank Merger Actoof IS66 as a per-i.ss ibl
missible basis for justifying anticompetitive mergers.
Before discussin the facts and-these legal issues,
however, I “ould ju*?t briefly like to exnlairt to the Court why
the Government considers this an important case and why the
Government has brought to this case a factual situation on its
face does not seem to be of the greatest economic significance.
Ten, fifteen years age, we had in this country a great

wave of tremendous bank mergers.

5

As a result of this Court9s decision in 1963 in the

6

Philadelphia bank merger case and a series of other decisions

7

under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, the focus of the whole trend

8

of bank mergers has shifted.

9

patera, of large bank mergers in the bis cities.

Today we no longer have this
Those seem to

1Q

be a thing of the past, because under this Court's decisions

11

these combinations and. these very large, highly concentrated

12

markets are illegal.
What we have instead is a developing trend of mergers

13
'14
15

among the smaller banks in the smaller areas.

In the past four

or five years, virtually all of the Justice Department's bank

16

merger suits have been brought against this type of merger.

17

reason we have brought these cases is that we think, since in

18

the 'smaller marketing areas, the very nature of banking tends

19

to make it a concentrated market, a relatively small number of

20

banks„

21
22

23

!

The

*
Since in the smaller communities, as I shall develop

;

in-the course of my argument, the people particularly affected
are the small borrowers, most of the small banks tend.,to be pr±~
small customers, we think it is parti­

24

marily concerned with the

35

cularly important in these small markets to
3

preserve for banking

(

1

customers the available alternatives of choice? that 'is, to make

2

sure that in these markets that already tend to be concentrated

3

there doss not take place a large number of bank mergers which

4

further reduce the available alternative.

5

That is why we think this particular type of situa­

6

tion — this is the first case that has come

7

involving so-called small bank mergers — that is why we have

8

brought the case.

These cases — we have

lost, I have to admit unfortunately, several of these cases in
the District Courts that we have not appealed, because these
cases under the Expediting Act, all of these bank merger cases,
come directly from the District Court to this Court.
There have been other cases, bank merger cases,

involv­

ing other issues in the Courts of appeals, but there have been
none of the Government suit’s challenging bank mergers in the
courts of appeals.
Q

How many of these have there been, Mr. Friedman,

that yon have decided not to bring here?

Hot to appeal, there have fceeen, I think, three or
But, those involved somewhat different situations

Those, in contrast to this case which involves the combination

2

of two banks in the same market, direct competitors, -- most

3

of the cases that we have brought and decided not to appeal have

4

been eases in which a large bank from outside of the immediate

area has come in and acquired a bank in the market.,

Does the record show how much business' the banks

A

There are various statistics in the record as to j

particular banks.

The testimony generally is in most instances j

they get a very small part of their business.

They get some,

but in terms of percentages, for example, there are records

showing that some banks get only a handfull.

As far away as Allentown and Bethlehem?

A few of those, not many.

in the trust business they get more of those, but basically,

in Easton — there is a bank in Easton that has one of the vary
finest trust departments.

In addition* of course, there is another
1

bank that does business in Easton that has a large trust depart
ment.
Q

From Allentown or Bethlehem?

A

Well, there is another bank, I think, one of the
10

banks that is outside of Easton, not in, Allentown and Bethlehem,
1
<"*

that does trust business in Easton -- has a branch in Easton.

Sn

And then, of course, thebanks in Allentown and Bethlehem, which

are much larger than any of these banks, have extensive trust

business.

They do get — there is evidence — these outside

5

banks do get trust business, of course.

These tend to be by and

6
larga the larger accounts, of course.
7

How, the District Court in this case basically, I think

8

it is fair to say, made three or four rulings that are signifi-|

9
cant here.

The Court in this case said.that because a large

10
number of other financial types of institutions are competing in f
1?
the area with the banks that the relevant market for testing com-r
12

pefitive effect in this case was not commercial banking as such,
13

The district judge pointed to the fact that you had savings and
14

loans associations, that you had finance companies, that you

15
had mutual funds that were seeking to obtain the savings deposit s
16

of the customers, that you had finance organisations seeking
37
loems „
16

IS

The Court, therefore, concluded that the appropriate
line of commerce for testing the effect of this merger was those

J.G
«articular service rendered by the bank. as to stick really there
21

v/as no significant competition.

'The services the Court include!I

22
in its line of commerce were checking accounts, savings accounts,
:

3

certificates of deposit, personal loans, consumer and install­
24

ment loans and commercial and. industrial loans.
25

But then rather inconsistent with this theory, when
-

11

-

1
the Court came to evaluate the affect of the merger on. competi­
2
tion by examing the concentration ratios and the increases in
3
concentration

,

the Court looked to the figures dealing with

4
commercial banking not with the subcategories of commercial
5

banking,, which the Court believed was the relative market.
6
So, what it amounts to, it seems to us, it is really
7

a kind of a dictum.

The Court said it didnBt think that com­

8
mercial banking was the relevant market, and then it turned
9

around and, in fact, tested this by commercial banking.

Q

Well, that is not the only grotSad.

A

And he also claims that it was rejected because he

claims it distorts.

Mr. Meyner, on behalf

of the banks, has objected to the distribution of this map on

20

22

It didn't say that essplicliy

15
16

but that is the

impression that one gets from the Court's opinion.

12

13

It didn5t say that explicily

Q

That it distorts the pictura, and I must say when

.

you indicate that there are no roads in between these cities.

A

We did not intend to indicate that, Mr. Justice.
-

12

-

1

This was just attempting to show the geographical area.

There

2

is a patchwork of roads.

‘There

3

are a whole lot of little towns.

4

There are extensive highways,

;

The reason we submitted this is because as the District

5

Court defined the market, the District Court listed about 30 or |

6

40 communities and said,

7

when you list communities unless one is familiar with this parti­

8

cular section of the country, it is difficult to see precisely

9

what is involved.

o

It is just a rough approximation.

i?
12
33

"I find that this is the market.”

And

We do not claim that this is exactly accurate.

But, I think, with the colors, it will indicate basi­
cally what is the area of dispute here.
The Government proposed in the District Court that the

14

relative market could be one of two areas a

i5

burg area itself, which is the part we have colored pink, or

16

the combination of Phillipsburg and Easten,whi.ylh is colored blue

17

either the Phillips-;

The defendants and the Comptroller of the Currency

i8

suggested a much broader market.

The District Court selected

19

a market somewhere in between, which is the part colored green

1C

which appears to be. roughly four times the sise or our market.

Z\

And, as is also shown by this map, the District Court included

12

in its relevant market the City of Bethlehem over the extreme

23

left and drew the line right between Bethlehem and Allentown,

.14

even though Allentown is contiguous to Bethlehem and in effect

25

is almost a continuation of it.
- 13 -

I

i

Now, within this market, the Court concluded ——

Q

What was the market urged by the Comptroller and

the appellees?

A

13

Q

In any event, it is not in this picture.

14

A

It is west, I an informed, Mr* Justice.

15

Now, within this broader area that the Court selected,

16

it fould that there was no substantial lessening of competition

17

there was no trend toward present or future concentration, -the

18

merging banks had only 6-3/4 percent of all banking assets*

19

After reaching that conclusion, the Court then said that that

21

the convenience-and-needs point had bean so fully canvassed it

But, since

would also rule on that.
It then held that the banks had

and need relying primarily on two factors? that the merger would

result in the new bank having a much larger lending limit then
the old bank and that it would permit the bank for the first
time to employ

it to build up a trust department for which' it found there was
need in the area.

7

&
9
10
11

In deciding the convenience-and-need point rather
interestingly, and,we think, erroneously, although the Court
had used the broad geographical market for determining competi­
tive impact, it evaluated the needs of the community solely in
terms of the needs of Phillipsburg, not Phillipsburg-Easton, but
just Phillipsburg.

Where are the relative administrative agencies

Yes.

Advised them what?

22

A

That the merger would have an adverse effect upon

23
24
25

competition,
Indeed, the two banking agencies in their recommenda­
tion viewed Phillipsburg primarily as the relevant market.

-15

-

The

Comptroller held a hearing and after the haering ruled that the

merger did not have the anfciecmpefcitive effect primarily, again,

3

because the Comptroller viewed the market much mors broadly than

as 1 say, that issue seems to be a real live one in the case, I
think I will leave the discussion to our brief on this point.
Now, coming to the first of the critical issues as
far as the Government is concerned, because we have to win on
to get a reversal here.

I might just add in passing that all wo

23

are asking this Court to do in -this case is to reverse and re­

24

mand to the District Court to Reconsider the community and con­

25

venience-and-needs defense under what we think is the proper

?

determination, and that the merger had an anticompetitive effect

2

in the relevant market.

3

This Court, in the Pabst case recognized that just as

4

with products so in the case of geographic areas, there may be

5

more than one geographic area that is relevant.

6

Court recognized that there wore three different markets, three

7

large markets.

8

concluded that the relevant market — that was the Wording

9

used, "the relevant market" — was this area that it had select­

14

with the merger of a bank in Phillipsburg, that would be the

15

appropriate market.

IS

ing the effect of this merger, these two banks in Phillipsburg,

17

that Phillipsburg-Easton together is a relevant market within

which to evaluate tine effect.

19

If, for example, we had a merger of a bank in Allentowr

But, we think for the purposes of determin­

In its Philadelphia bank decision, this Court stated

20

that in determining the appropriate geographical market, the

21

proper question is not where the parties to the merger do busi­

ness or even where they compete but where within the area are

23

competitive overlap the effect of the merger on competition

24
25

will be direct and immediate.

I will now proceed to show

that this merger will have a direct and immediate effect upon

-

17

-

1

competition in the Phillipsburg-Easton area.

2

Q

Do you rule out. the possibility that the merged

3

institutions could expand their business to the outer perimeter

4

of the larger area by virtue of the merger?
h

5

We don’t rule that out* Mr. Justice, but 1 think

5

again in -the Philadelphia bank case this Court indicated the

7

critical inquiry is where the immediate effect will be felt.

8

Of course, we are dealing here with potential injury to compe­

3

tition .

It doesn’t have to be an actual injury# all the statute

13

requires is where the effect may be.

and, we think that, if,

11

in fact, this has that effect in a relevant market, the merger

12

cannot be saved because of the fact that the banks may be able

13

to expand into the peripheral areas.

14

The figures we have at page 37, footnotes 29 of our

IS

brief, is a table which breaks down as between the different

13

types of business, the sources of the merging banks’ business.

1/

The deposit and loan statistics therein.contained show that the

!;$

banks do roughly 85 percent of their business in Phillipsburg

n

and Easton, as I had previously indicate-* in. answer to a ques­

20

tion of Hr. Justice Stewart, that there is very little in the

21

way of solicitation outside the area and very comparatively

22

little done outside and similarly banks outside of the area

23
2%
23

generally only solicit in the area on rare occasions.
Indeed, -the business is even more localised than -that.
It seems to be pretty much localised within Phillipsburg and
18

within Eastono

For example, each of the merging hanks did only

10 percent of its business ~~ 1 am sorry — got only 3-0 per™
cent of its savings and time deposits from Easton»

Statistics

indicate that almost every one of the 8,500 families in Phillips'
burg deals with one of the three banks in that area»

Numerous

businessmen in Phil lips burg testified that they preferred, to
deal with a local bank in Phillipsburg than to go across the
river to Easton.
It is not surprising that this business is thus local­

9
ized, because the vast bulk of the customers of these two banks
10
are small people.

In terms of the number 'of deposits of these

f1
12

banks, just under three quarters of the total number of deposits
are less $1,000 and 96 percent of them are less than $10,000.

13
Again, in terms of loans, the percentages are some­
14

what smaller but nevertheless quite strong.

Phillipsburg

13
National had roughly three quarters of its loans for less than
10
$2,500»

Second National has 58 percent.

When you get to loans

1?
of up to $10,000, 86 and 94 percent are less than $10,000.
18
As this Court recognised in the Philadelphia bank
19
case, these figures actually reflect the realities of banking.

io
Banking la essentially local.

It is locally oriented and parti­

21
cularly so for the small customers in convenience.

The con­

22
venience of access to have your bank near you is the important
23
thing.
24
The merging banks indeed themselves recognize this be­
25
cause as the suburban communities developed four or five miles
-

19

outside of the center of Phiilipsburg, they opened branches

i
there.

As the vice president of Phiilipsburg National explained,

2
he said,

"That8s where the customers are.R

3
Furthermore, the vice president of Phiilipsburg Na­
4
tional pointed out in response to a question that a great many

5
of the loans that they make in this small town are based pri­

6
marily on the character of the borrower.

He said that a man

8
Phiilipsburg would find it very difficult to obtain, a loan in
S
any area outside where they weren't known.
SO
Now, the banks themselves in thier business have

11
recognised the integrated, localised character of the Phillips-

12
burg-Easton market.

Phiilipsburg and Easton are in different

n
Federal Reserves districts, which means that normally their

14
checks would clear through different Federal Reserve clearing
IS
house banks and this would obviously cause a considerable, pro­

18
blem.
17
So, what they have done, they have established some­

18
thing they call the Easton-Phiilipsburg clearing house.

Every

19
three months or so one of the banks in this area takes its turn

20
to act as a clearing house for all checks drawn on banks in the

zt

Phillipsburg-Easton area.

The president of the largest bank in

22
Easton,in discussing this arrangement said, at page 140 of the

23
appendix, ha said,

"This arrangement seems to be another fact

24
which indicates a closely knit

25

2(5

community even though separated

I

Another indication of the integrated nature of this

2

banking community is the fact that for many years banks in the

3

surrounding area outside the Philiipsfourg-Easton area were pay­

4

ing four percent on savings.

5

were paying three percent, the Philiipsburg banks three and a

6

half.

at the same time, the Easton banks

to

Now, the significance of all of these facts of locali­

11

zation comes down to this that this indicates to us that this is

12

the area where the effect of the merger will be primarily felt.

13

These are the people, the people who deal with these banks, who

14

give their business and from whom the banks derive a vast part

15

of their business, these are the people to whom the elimination

These are the

And this is, in effect, in the

The basic error of the District Court, we think, was

21

its refusal to recognise the significance of these considerations

22

and instead its reliance on the fact that there is a great deal

of business and work mobility within the broader area, that is

But this case, of course, is dealing with the effect
of this merger on banking not on other businesses.

The fact

that a man is going to drive 20 or 25 miles to work, to buy a
new suit of clothes, to buy a new sofa doesn't mean ha is going

to drive 20 or 25 miles to bank. Indeed, all the indications

12

I take it the argument is that it is too small and therefore

cannot be a relevant section, of the country within the meaning

of the statute.

With all due respect, Mr. Justice, we would have

to disagree.

In the Nashville case, the Court stated that it didn't believe

that in the Bank Merger Act Congress intended any change in the

in the rule pronounced in the Philadelphia bank case where the

If we are correct in our conclusion, that this merger

I

the court’s balancing tests that any anticompetitive effects

were clearly outweighed by the community convenience and need it

As again in National Bank, the Court recognized, it

Therefore, we think the case has to go back to the Dis­

trict Court as in Nashville Bank properly to perform the balanc­

But since the District Court undertook to determine

convenience and need and since on a remand the issue would again

arise, we have fully discussed this issue and we think it is apprr

21

priate for this Court to consider it.
We think the District Court committed two basic errors

23
24

i.n applying the convenience-and-needs standard.
i.t used the wrong market area.

First, we think

Secondly, it misapplied the con-

top of page 62 in our brief.

appeal.

Q

How long has the suit been pending?

A

The suit was filed in January, 1968, a little over

w
two years.
20
The basic purpose, of course, of this eonvenience-and-

needs defense is to permit bank mergers to go forward, which even
&&
though they are anticompetitive produce such significant benefits
23
to the community that on balance it appears that the public

interest would be best served by sanctioning such an anticompeti­
tive merger.
-

28

-

1

It seemes,however, for os that for this comparison

2

to be a meaningful one the community benefits resulting from the

3

merger have to be assessed in the same area as the community defc::

4

ments also resulting from the merger, because in both instances

£

what you are considering are the banking needs dr the community.

6

Ort the one hand, you look to the banking needs to determine what

7

the area is where the merger will have its effect and then you

8

look and turn around on the other side and say what effect —

§

favorable effect ~~ on the same banking needs will the merger

10

have.

;i

To be sure, there may be situations in which a merger*

,2:

will have an effect, a beneficial effect, upon a segment of the

1:3

5

community, and that beneficial effect on the segment of the
community rebounds to the benefit of the entire community.
It does seem to us that while that is permissible

for testing the impact of the merger upon competition.
That, we think, is just precisely the situation we have
in tliis case in terms of what we think is the relevant market,
the PhillipsburgyEaston market.

primarily as the ground for sanctioning this merger.

2

I think there is a substantial need.

But there

is no indication that it is not -- that the need for the big
loans is not being adequately met in this area.

That is what I

3
am suggesting* Mr. Justice? is first of all ----4
Q

Yes, but let’s assume that there is a recurring

5
need for loans in excess of $100,000 in the Phillipsburg-Easfcon
6
area and one bank has a large lending limit and it can satisfy
7
all that need.

You would say that would be automatically an

S
adequate answer to the community needs?
3
h

X wouldn’t say that it would automatically be an

10
answer,, Mr. Justice, but I would say the need, the community need
1!
for an additional bank for the large loans under that hypothesis
12

1 think would be a relatively minor factor in assessing community
13

needs.
U

Q

You wouldn't say there would be anything in the

13
argument that it would help the community to provide some competi­
16

tion in tiie large-loan area.
17

A

18

I think that would be a factor, but 1 think it

would be a relatively minor factor.

1 suggest, Mr. Justice, thaf.

19
on the other side of the balance these loans that, we are talking
20

about involve a small number of people.

The record shows that

21
during the average year the Phillipsburg National Bank had a
22
request for 25 loans in excess of its lending limit as against
23
24
25

same-5,000 loans it had.

The Second National Bank, I think,

averaged something like 17 requests a year out of some-2,200
loans thaf it had.

Welly

that is fine,; but people don31 ask banks —

a year?

then?

17

What would you say about the lending-limit argument

A

1 think

the lending-limit argument would be a

strong one, but even then 1 am not sure that basically that con­

sidering benefits to the community, I think it is appropriate

and necessary to consider other ways by which the banks would

And, in con­

I would also like to point out that the court's evalua­

in another respect that it doesn't appear that either the banks
or the court adequately explored the possibility of alternate
methods of achieving these same benefits.
For example, at fcha time of this merger, New Jersey

law permitted banks to merge within their own county.

In Warren

County where Phillipsburg is located, there were at that time six
other banks which would have been available to these banks as a

23
merger.

In the City of Washington, about 12 miles away, there

24
were two banks of roughly comparable sise.

Re

said we plowed back our dividends in order to meet the growing
requirements of our community and despite this lack of payments
3f cash dividends, they recently made a substantial took offer­
ing that was 50 percent oversubscribed.
In addition, the third bank, the Phillipsburg Trust

16

for many years followed a practise of paying only stock

I think this should be contrasted with the statement

of Mr. Varga, the vice-president of Phillipsburg National, when
tie said that the bank at the present time couldn’t hire three
specialists that they would like to have.

He said it would be

3xpensive, and it would be a burden in our profits and the divilenfcs for our shareholders.

It

mers in the small areas the opportunity to preserve idle availa­

12

13

Of course, banking by its very nature in these small

21

the competitive opportunities for the small people in this small

Again, it would follow in his market but act

ARGUMENT OF PHILIP L. ROACHE, JR., ESQ. ON BEHALF

13

OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER

14

MR. ROACHEs

15
10

17

Thank you, Mr. Friedman,, Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

ourt„
I would like to first primarily address myself to the

18

eds and effects of the merger and the relevant geographic

19

rea, particularly as it applies to the new banking laws in Mew

20

ersey, to the appellant's contention that the District Court

21

pplied erroneous standards in assessing the convenience and

22

seds and to the appellant's contention that the merging banks

23

ad the District Court failed to adequately consider the less

24

aticompetitive alternatives to the merger.

-

25

Before I do that, if I may, I would like to make a
Diriment or two on some of the answers to questions that Mr.

40

1

First, we disagree, and I disagree, that the District

2

Court ruled that commercial banks was the line of commerce.

3

X

believe that the District Court recognised the fact that these

4

banks perform various functions, that demand deposits alone per­

5

haps was the only line of commerce, but in New Jersey savings

S

banks also have a demand deposit function.

7

But the District Court, as 1 analyse its opinion., stated

8

they hadn't proved their case and didn't really attempt to say

9

this is it and this is it and this is it.

First the burden was

10

on the plaintiff to prove his case and to prove that commercial

11

banking is the line of commerce, and the District Court felt

12

that because of all of these other alternatives that were avail­

13

'

able and the testimony adequately showed that they were in compe­

14

tition with all of these other areas, specifically in the savings

IS

and loan and savings bank where these banks were so predominant

w

in savings and in lending for residents, that these people did

17

compete.

However, he didn't have to come out and made a determina­

19

tion that this is in competition, this is in competition, this

state all of these other functions were in competition with

in competition.

As I interpret it, he said you haven't proved

24

One other comment Mr. Friedman made was that the recent

25

antitrust case in the banking field did not involve smaller banks
-

41

-

1

that this is the first smaller bank, that large banks have no

2

longer been merging.

3

This isn't quite true.

The Crocksr--Angl o case which was subsequent to the

4

Nashville case and subsequent to the Philadelphia National Bank

5

case involved a merger of a bank, the resulting bank had $4 bil­

6

lion in assets.

$350 million bank acquiring a bank with assets of about $26 mil­

.nd Easton banks and would eliminate the existing apathy in bankng competition in the area, and that the merger would be proiompefcitive and benefit the community with better personnel and

There is an abundance of evidence to the effect that

he merger would enable the resultant bank to hire the needed per

21

MR, MEYNER;

22
23

Governor Meyner?

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the

Court.
I shou dJlxke to point out that this is the culmination
of a long series of episodes by which two banks endeavor to ue

1

pro-competitive in an extensive area..

2

problems that existed as between older management and younger

3

management as to how we could serve the customers in the neigh­

4

borhood f the people who were in need of loans to finance various

5

enterprises, all of those problems were taken into consideration.

'6
7

It was felt that this was the only way that we could meet the
problems„
So, we discussed merger and in 1967 singed an agree­

ment and then filed an application with the Comptroller.

Tne

three agencies;, not through their somber boards, but rather through
bureaucratic employees, took the narrow, blind view that; only
lias ton was a market, or that PhiXlipsburg and Easton was a mar­
ket.

They submitted adverse reports.
But, then there was a full and adequate hearing before

14
15

Discussion to meet tne

the Comptroller.

Justice chose not to appear on the scene,

fee

produced witnesses and then a decision was arrived at that tills
vas an area somewhat similar to the Standard Metropolitan Statis
tical Area which is set forth in white in this exhibit, Exhibit
Ho. 13.
Then we found that after we were ready .to go anead with
the merger Justice starts suit.

Then we go to the District

Court in New Jersey v/here we have 1,6 00 pages of testimony, where
we have over 100 exhibits, where we are put to untold difficulty

23
in getting out records as to duplicate depositors in each bank,
24
furnishing infinite information.
25
68

And., then, the judge became ill

i

after the conclusion of the case and we waited a year for a

2

decision^ and now this suit is here before you,

3

1 would like to address myself to three things»

One,

I believe that the record shows that this is pro-competitive,

There isn't one witness, least of all Mr» Leupo, who says fcnafc fch.it

I?

Healthy competition to the extent that we have grown, that we

have recognised and we have progressed, I would say it was health,

competition,85
The court, "When you define it as healthy competition,
do I understand correctly that you consider this competition as
a factor in your own growth?”
And I say to you, if you read the record, 1,600 pages,
you cannot find one of the people who, as bankers, appeared on
the scene who said that this was anticompetitive.

Hot one.

We will take Mr. Greenley of the second largest bank
in New Jersey.

He looked over the entire situation,

lie pointed

21

22

out that there was no premium on any of the exchange of shares
like there was in the Nashville case.

He pointed out that there

23
was a fair exchange and that there was nothing about it that

would cause customers to have to pay- the toll or pay anything

But most of the

seems rather obvious.

That

Well, I think the customer that we are talking,

8

the customer that Mr. Friedman is so solicitous about, be will

9

have five choices instead of two in on® instance and three in —

SO

Q

1 understand, but you do start with the proposition

11

that 'the competition between the two banks is going to be elimina­

12

ted, but your point is that competition will be served in other

S3

ways and in ways that will overbalance any loss of competition.

U

That is my point.

15

A

Yes, indeed, and the customer will not be hurt.

16

Because the charges are essentially the same for checking accoun:

17

and more and more since there is a better return on time deposits

18

roost of the money is going into the time deposit area.

19

you take William F. Jones of the Easton bank, he specifically

20

pointed out that this would be pro “•competitive.

21

Q

Yes, but how is it pro-competitive.

When

I understand

22

how some could be eliminated between these two banks but speci-

23

ically, how is competition going to be served by the merger?

24
25

A

We had at least 10 witnesses who appeared, appli­

ances dealers, automobile dealers, manufacturers, industry people

70

1

who pointed out that their needs were well in excess of $200,000

and Mr. Falk.

Mr. Riccardi

Mr. Falk who operates outside of Phillipsburg, a

tremendous market, outside of Easton one, outside — and two outsdie of Allentown.
The testimony is replete.

There isn't one, as there

is in these previous cases, there isn't one person or one banker
who came in and said this will effect the community, this will
hurt the community.

Most people were willing to testify.

Mo pn4>

testified against it except Mr. Edwards, who was a young Phi), with
13

a JD degree and the age of 31, and who, on the basis of casual
14

empiricism, arrived at the conclusion by this doctoral thesis
15

on the basis of standard metropolitan statistical areas — h® ha<}l
IS
examined some 49 of them and he examined them in terms of what
17

happened in 1955 and 1957.

He concluded that, when you'had a

18

merger of this sort interest rates on savings deposits were re­
19

used and interest on loans were increased.
20

This was contradicted by all of our experts, contra­
21
dicted by bankers.
22
Q

But how is competition going to be served?

Is

23

competition going to be served, you say, by enabling another unit
24

to service larger loans?

That is on® way.

Is that all?

25

A

Yes.

As was pointed out in Nashville and

71

1

two banks will be better able to compete with other banks in any

2

of these areas.
Now, let's take the Standard Metropolitan Statistical

Bank Merger Act of 1966 did remedy that situation.

That situation of a larger loan limit in the PhiXadeip iii

National bank case was sort of held out because it was felt that

12

the Bank Merger Act prevented it, the Bank Merger Act of I960.

But the Bank Merger Act of 1966, I think, by the Nashville case
indicated that that would be one of the factors.

Another factor

would be better management, a better opportunity to hire employees
The record here demonstrates that the president of the
Second National is well over 80 and the next man is 71 or 72 and
the man after that is 39 or probably 40, 41.

The head of the

Phillipsburg National Bank is now about 73 and the next man is
about 61, 62, who wants to retire early.

When you come down to

the next level, it is about 40 and 39.
Now, Kinnaxnon, who represented the largest bank south
of us, the Hunterdon County Nafcioi^LBank said it is too late to
go out and try to do it alone.

You have to hvee a merger.

Greer

of the Lafayette Trust Company, a former bank examiner, who was

pulled in as a young man and who has done a good job for

limit in Easton, and he' says that he can't do it without a mer­

He says this is untrue today.

He says that they borrow it by

11
notes on less than 270 days from the leading insurance and manu­

12
facturing companies.

For instance, U.S. Steel maybe 80 days

13
from now will have to make a tax payment so they will, buy some
14

notes from one of the leading finance companies.

15
That is the way that they get a good deal of thair
16
money and Homer Kripke, who is an expert nere and who has testi­

17
fied, said that only about 10 percent of the finance companies
18
get their money from the banks.

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

In this minute, there are two points I would like
One is the legal argument and the other is to give

some statis*

s that the Department has worked out as to the

Comptroller's record in approving the merger.

18

The legal point I would like to make is just tills.

19

The problems faced by these two banks are basically the same

20
21
.22
23'
24
25

problems faced by most banks in the smaller communities..

The

difficulty is that they don't have a large enough lending limit4
they have difficulty hiring people and they would like to expand
We don(t think -the statute contemplates that the way to solve
these problems is by combining two successful banks that axe
directly competing with each other.

82

There are other ways

1

available to these banks.

2
3

For one thing, they can increase their capitalisation.
The record shows that in 19

Q
outside?

6

7

What happens if they get bought by a bigger bank

A

Well, if they get bought by a bigger hank, Mr.

Justice, you are not eliminating the competition between them.

S

Q

And -the Department would prefer that?

0

A

I think the Department would, Mr, Justice, if it

10

is just a -small bank because you

Q

11

It would be better to have a Phildelphia bank,

12

a big Philadelphia bank owning on© of these banks or both of

13

these banks for that matter, right?

14

A

Well, I don’t know, Mr. Justice.

But it would

15

seem to me to be a -very different situation because even if a

16

Newark — it would have to be a Newark bank since it is in New

1?

Jersey — but if a Newark bank purchased one of these banks a

18

you would still have three competing banks in the area.

19

this merger, you have only two competing banks in the Phillips-

20

You will reduce the number in this community by

will reduce it from four to two.

fcher was in Oklahoma City.

Yes, down to six, but we think with an already

concentrated market and with the fact, that while you have one
community of seven the indication is that the major focus of
banking is in each community.

We think that the elimination of

this number and the significant increase in concentration is
enough.

Now, if I might, Mr. Chief Justice, because of the
16
questions raised, could I permissibly just indicate some, of
17
the statistics the Department —

Couldn't you submit those because your friends

19
are going to submit some other things.

I would like just a summary, if we may.

The summary of the statistics we have and we will

21

submit them.

Q

Will you submit them also?

A

Yes, v/e will submit a letter, and we will have

to check the statistics, but the preliminary information we have

is that in the years 1967 and .1968, in each of those years, tne
Comptroller approved approximately 88 mergers.

These are our

statistics and we think it is roughly approximate.
disapproved one and approved 38.

In 1987, he

In 1968, he didn't disapprove

any, and in 1369, we have figures roughly more than 100 as far
as we can show there are no denials.

This is our rough figures

after we ——

But this doesn't reach the point of the mergers

which might have been discouraged?

No.

Actual filings?

Comptroller.

Q

And there was a hearing?

A

I don't know if there was a hearing.

Q

Or at least there was a formal application filed

and it was rejected.
17
A

There was a formal application.

And these do not

18
cover mergers where the application was withdrawn after it had
19
been filed.

These are applications on which he acted.

We will

20
supplement this and try to obtain as accurate figures as we can.

Thank you.
