OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. MCLAUGHLIN;

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice? may it please -the

Court%
This case presents an issue which this Court faced

10

8 years ago in Sinclair Refining Company vs. Atkinson.

11

question is again here today, as well as an additional question

12

or two that was not present in Sinclair.

13

The

The issue, basically, is whether federal courts have

14

jurisdiction, under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations

15

Act of .1947, to enjoin strikes and work stoppages by labor

18

organizations in violation of their premises contained in

17

their labor agreements not to engage in strikes or work

18

stoppages during the term of the labor agreement and to submit

19

such disputes to arbitration.

20

This involves the question as to whether the Norris-»

21

LaGuardia Act should be accommodated to Section 391 and held

22

not to bar the issuance of injunctions against strikes in breach

23

of a promise to arbitrate and not to strike.

24
25

So the continuing validity of this Court#s decision
in Sinclair is squarely at issue here today.
2

\

Msof there is a subsidiary question,, and that

1
2

relates to the continued vitality of state court injunctions

3

in the federal court after removal under 'Aveo„

4

assuming that this Court finds that Sinclair was rightly

S

decided.

S

The factual background is simple.

That is

The petitioner

7

and respondent, at all times material hereto, were parties to

8

a collective bargaining agreement.

9

in pertinent part, that all

Mow that agreement provided,

disputes involving in any way the

10

interpretation and application of the agreement shall be

n

submitted to arbitration.

12

It further contained a specific agreement that

13

there would be no strikes, cessations of work, picketing,

!4

boycotts or lockouts during the term of the contract.

15

It contained yet another specific provision, namely,

16

that matters subject to the arbitration procedure should be

17

settled and resolved by that established procedure.

18

The employer operates a chain of some 35 super markets’.

19

On a particular day in 1969 the employer was utilising some

20

non-bargaining unit personnel to stock a frozen food case.

21

A union business agent observed this and objected, demanded

22
23

24
25

that the employer cease.
The employer, believing that it was not in violation
of the contract, refused.

The union sailed a strike.

tine employees left the store.

Picketing commenced.

The employer demanded arbitration.

Court of the County of Los Angeles and obtained a temporary-

7

restraining order and also an order to show cause where a

8

preliminary injunction was issued.

9

The employer went to the Superior

Now in connection with this state court procedure,

10

union counsel was notified as provided by local court rule.

11

After argument in chambers and consideration of the verified

12

complaints and the affidavits and the like, the order was

13

issued.
Now the temporary restraining order enjoined the work

14
15

stoppage.

The union responded promply by removing the case to

16

the federal court*, and in the federal court, filed a motion

17

to dissolve the temporary restraining order.

18

In opposition, the employer filed in the federal

19

court a motion for an order compelling arbitration, for an

20

order requiring specific performance of the agreement to

21

arbitrate and an application for a preliminary injunction

22

against the strike.

23

Now the district judge was well aware of Avco and

24

was well aware of this Court's decision in Sinclair.

documents submitted, he denied the union's motion to cross

Your Honors, the underlying premise of -the trilogy

7
8

in the Lincoln Mills of the law which this Court has developed

9

under Section 301

10

is that arbitration is the most favorable

solution, the most feasible solution, to industrial workers.
Adjudication on the merits is to be substituted for

11

12

muscle.

13

the quid pro quo for the employer's agreement to arbitrate.

14

This Court has said that the no-strike agreement is

Now, if unions are free to strike and the employer

IS

is bound to arbitrate, this does not only mean that the

IS

employer doss not receive the benefit of his bargain •— which

I?

is really about the only thing an employer gets in the labor

18

agreement -— but also a most serious imbalance results.

19
20

21

22

This Court has said that arbitration is the kingpin
of the federal labor policy under Section 301.

Well, the king­

pin is destroyed by the strike in breach of contract where
the union is obligated to arbitrate the underlying

23

Q

Are you asking ins to overrule the Sinclair Case?

24

A

Yes, Your Honor.

25

Q

When was it decided?

I am.

1

A

In 1962, Your Honor,

z

Q

Is it a statutory decision?

3

A

Your Honor, it was the decision of this Court

4

Q

Was it based on a statute?

3

A

Yes, sir,

S

Q

Nothing but a statute?

7

Congress for changes?

S

A

Your Honor, in Sinclair this Court —

9

Q

Are you trying to get the dissent in that case

10

Has it been presented to

of 1962 reinstated as the lav/ today under the statute?
A

11

‘That is correct, sir, yes. Because I believe

12

the dissent was correct.

The decision of .1962 is simply out of

13

harmony with the congressional policy which this Court has

14

found in Section 301; that is that the federal courts under

15

Section 301 are to develop a body of federal labor law.

16

as I pointed out before, arbitration has been declared to be

17

the king pin of that policy.

And,

Now the objection that the Morris-LaGuardia Act

18
19

forbids what almost every commentator agrees is necessary and

20

desirable

21

Section 301 and the Norris-LaGuardia Act so as to give 'the

22

fullest possible effect to the central purpose of both statutes.

23

is simply not sound.

Because you can accommodate

The Court has' done -this before.

It has done it in

24

the field of anti-trust.

Justice Frankfurter, writing for the

25

Court, accommodated Norris-LaGuardia to the anti-trust laws in

6

In Chicago River this Court accommodated

i

the Hutcheson Case»

z

Section 301 with the Railway Labor Act.

3

Lincoln Mills this Court likewise accommodated the Morris-

4

LaGuardia Act with Section 301.

3

7
8

9

Q

And, I submit -that in

Have you filed or joined in any request to

Congress to change the statute as we construed it?
A

No, Your Honor, neither I nor anyone I represent

has approached the Congress on this matter, sir.
Now no viable distinction, it seems to me, can be

10

made between the accommodation of Chicago River and the failure

11

to accommodate in Sinclair with Section 301.

12

tion is that in Chicago River the arbitrator was 'the National

13

Railroad Adjustment Board.

14

301, it is an arbitrator who is selected through the contrac­

15

tually agreed upon procedures.

16

The only distinc­

And here, under Taft-Hartley Section

I respectfully submit that the question that was

17

asked, or the question rather that was stated, in the Court8s

18

opinion in Sinclair, was the wrong question.

19

Court starts off stating the question as being whether Section

20

301, and I believe the phrase used, is "impliabiy repealed'1

21

Section 4 of the Morris-LaGuardia Act.

22

that is, obviously, no.

23
24
25

i

The opinion of the

I think the answer to

I think the proper question — I would respectfully
suggest — is a question as to whether the statutes should be
accommodated to each other.

And I think the answer there is
?

i

I

just as obvious,, and it is yes*

z

The legislative history of Section 301 ——

3

Q

I suppose that you would say that, as a thresh-

4 ! hold matter, before a court could issue an injunction to
5

enforce the no-strike clause, the court would have to pass on

6

the arbitrability of the dispute?
A

7

Well, obviously, Your Honor»

And as this Court

8

has pointed out, it is the function of the court to determine

9

arbitrability»

'20

Q

And pass on the scope of the no-strike clause?

11

A

That is, undoubtedly, the case, because

12

0

Are there any exceptions to it and tilings like

14

A

X can’t 'think of any at the moment. Your Honor»

15

Q

What about an unfair labor practice strike?

18

A

13

17
18

that?

In an unfair labor practice strike, of course,

that is some-thing
Q

So the court is going to end up doing a lot of

19

the arbitrator's work just to get to the injunction question,

20

aren't they?

21

A

I don’t think so, Your Honor, because, unless

22

an agreement specifically confides the question of arbitrability

23

to the arbitrator, it is the court's function to determine

24

arbitrability*

25

to interpret the scope of the arbitration clause»

Now in determining arbitrability, you have

8

And it is

1

not unusual, in contracts for matters to be excepted from the

2

scope of the arbitration clause.

3

Likewise, with respect to a no-strike clause, it

seems to me

Q

§

Is this contract, under which tills dispute arose,

still in effect?
A

This particular contract expired, was replaced

after a strike by a successor contract.

anything to do with the issues before this Court, are identical.

They haven't been changed.
Q

They are in force.

Nobody has to determine whether or not there is

any contract about this?
A

14

No, there is no issue in this case at all.

15

counsel, for example, will not deny; 1} that there was a labor

16

agreement.

There certainly was.

Q

And the dispute wa3 arbitrable?

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

Now to get it in focus, what would happen if the

21

employer locked put the employees and the union wanted a

22

remedy, what are their alternatives?

23

A

What are their remedies?

Under this contract and under similar contracts,

24

if the union business agent had come in the store and he had

25

said, t?You are improperly stocking the frozen food cases? it
9

1

is a violation,"

2

you had better forget about it," and then the union business

3

agent refused to, and then the employer locked the people out

4

or something like that, then the union could have gone to

S

court, under this contract and under the law as 1 think it is

6

and should be, could have gone to court and could have obtained

7

a restraining order against the employer.

3

have stipulated *--

13

Q

and the employer had said,, "It is not, and

In fact, I would

Doesn’t Norris-LaGuardia forbid injunctions

against both employers and unions?
A

It most certainly does, sir.

But I don’t think

that Norris-laGuardia forbids ——
Q

Well, I know your argument that it doesn’t, but

14

what is the present state of the lav/ under Sinclair.

15

Sinclair could the union get an injunction against the employer?

Under

16

A

No, sir.

17

Q

So that, at least as of now, under Sinclair

18
19

both

-the employer and union are in the same posture.
A

Well, they are in the same posture with respect

20

to getting an injunction, but they are not in the same posture

21

with respect to the objectives of arbitration, with respect

22

to what the real meaning of -the situation is.

23

Q

Let. me strip it away then.

Are they in the

24

same posture in terms of the enforceability of the no-strike

25

clause or the no-lockout clause?
10

A

I

Legally speaking, in terms of their right to

2

access to the court, or lack of right, they are in the same

3

position, yes,' sir.
Q

4

So that if we overrule Sinclair, you would

S

put them again in the same posture, but they each would have

6

access to the injunctive power of the courts to compel arbi­

7

tration?

8

A

Absolutely, Your Honor.

B

Q

Would that have been true when Sinclair was

A

Yes, sir, I believe so.

10
11
12

argued?

As 7. started to say, the legislative history of

13

this statute doesn!t indicate a congressional disapproval

14

this accommodation that we are suggesting here today.

15

Sinclair this Court read more into that legislative history

16

than it can properly bear.

17

of

In

Justice Frankfurter, in his dissent in Lincoln Mills,

13

I believe, said that the legislative history of Section 301

19

leaves us in the dark.

20

of this Court said that the legislative history of Section 301

HI

was cloudy and confusing.

22
23
24

25

In Lincoln Mills the majority opinion

One thing Lincoln Mills did say about that legislative
history, though, was that Congress was interested in promoting
collective bargaining that ended with agreements not to strike.
If Congress was interested in promoting collective bargaining

11

that ended with agreements not to strike, the enforcement of

those agreements must be provided fox*

doing, it, obviously, wasn't, engaging in an idle exercise to

3

encourage people to make agreements which were meaningless in

practical effect.

so as to make them

Because one thing Congress, obviously, wasn't

If arbitration is going to work, -the federal scheme

1
3

must permit the effectuation of labor policy in the field of

9

arbitration by means of the injunction against the strike and

10

breech of contract.
Now it has been suggested that this is not necessary.

1!

12

It has been suggested that there are other and alternative

13

ways to handle this problem.

14

damages has been suggested.

For example, the remedy of

Well, damages as a remedy against a union, Your

if both parties agreed to arbitrate but not otherwise.

Then you can arbitrate, and then you can enforce

I don't know what their position would be with

respect to that.

make.

22

The dispute involved the propriety of the way a frozen food

23

case was being stocked, a rather large frozen food case.

24
25

I have three comments that I would like to

First, with respect to what would has

happened heres

Now the collective bargaining relationship of these
parties is made up of hundreds and thousands of disputes like
3.3

1

this over the years,

2

wait while somebody got an order to arbitrate and then had an

3

arbitration hearing and then came back with an order ~~ and

4

that leaves still unanswered. Your Honor, the question of the

5

court's ability to specifically enforce the award of the

6

arbitrator; that, is a question? it came up in Mew Orleans

7

Steamship and Philadelphia Marine — in any event, my employer

8

in this case — it isn't worth it.

of his bargain.

If the employer in this case had to

Whatever happened can be

Now a strike in breach of contract is something of

7

an entirely different order.

8

So that is why, Your Honor, I don't think that there is an

9

unequality as Your Honor -- at least to me — seemed to be

10

suggesting.

II

Q

It is not the same thing at all.

May I ask you a question, perhaps, drawing

12

more on your own experience?

where I have practiced — that Sinclair has had much of an

I can throw some light on it from my own

the courts

there refused to accept removed cases from the superior courts.
Now the gimick is, in combination Sinclair and Avco,
you see, we remove the case from the superior court.

anomaly of that is — and Congress could never have intended

Your Honor, 1 think a number of things have

happened to change it.

Q

Is it anymore wrong now than it. was then?

17

A

I believe it is because of Avco.

'18

Q

Because of what?

19

A

Because of this Court's decision in Avco.

20

You

see previously —-

21

Q

In which case?

22

A

In the Avco Case, Your Honor, concerning the

23

24
23

right of removal from state courts to federal courts of Section
301 actions.
You see what actually happened was — and this is
16

i

anomaly, if I may say so — that here we have a situation where • —

2

Mow suppose that Your Honors don't agree with rae and that

3

Sinclair remains with continued vitality, then you put it

4

together with Avqc, then we come up with this next question*

forced plaintiffs into state courts, where state courts will

15

to create a body of federal law, of having results that have

And then the other side of it, if you say Norris™

18

LaGuardia will require those injunctions to be dissolved, as I

17

have said before, an employer has less; ways of effectuating his

18

agreement than he had before 301*

19

That is not right*

Thirdly, if you .say state courts are bound by Norris-

20

LaGuardia — and we know we can't say that from Norris-LaGuardia —

21

we would have to import that through an interpretation of

22

Section 301*

Do you think that might be the best place to

go for people who feel that the will of Congress has been
perverted?

In statutory matters?
A

Well, Your Honor, this Court has interpreted

statutes in various

ways.

For example, if you take a look at

the legislative history of Lincoln Mills — as you most certainly
have — not Lincoln Mills but Section 301, we find in there

Mr. Justice Black, I am saying that I can't

don't think there is anything unusual about that, either in otsr

really painting the Court and the profession and the law into

21

fact that we now have to decide ■— if Sinclair remains viable —

22

we have to decide what are we going to do about removed state

23

court injunctions.

24

about the power of state courts to issue injunctions, particu­

25

larly where, for some reason, they are not removed.

I have pointed out what I think is

If we get by that, what are we going to do

21

1

1 would suggest that a proper accommodation of

2

Norris-LaGuardia and Section 301 sanctions the injunction in

3

this case.

4

I would say that the availability of the injunction is far

5

more necessary to Section 301 than it is detrimental to

5

Norris-LaGuardia.

7

It is a vital part of Section 3015s effectuation.

Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that the

8

judgment of the Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit should

9

be reversed, with instructions to affirm the order of the

District Court.
