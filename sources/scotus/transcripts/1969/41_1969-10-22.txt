ARGUMENT OF LON KILE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF
PETITIONERS THE CHOCTAW NATION AND THE CHICKASAW NATION
MR. KILE:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

30

Court:

This action is on certiorari to the Tenth Circuit Court

n

through a U.S. decision affirming a pre-trial order of the

12

District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma which, in

13

effect, vested title to the navigable portion of the Arkansas

U

River within Oklahoma in the State.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

20

Arkansas River that lies within Oklahoma.

21

river with which this case is concerned is navigable.

22

The stretch of the

Oklahoma contends that in Colonial days the Crown

23

owned the beds ot the navigable streams and that when the 13

24.

colonies became independent, they succeeded to the rights of

25

the Crown, so that they then became the owners of the beds of
3

f

the navigable streams within their limits and that afterwards,

2

as each State entered the Union, it entered on an equal footing

3

with the original 13 colonies and, thus, said the State, when

4

Oklahoma became a State in 1907, it succeeded to the title that

3

the United States had in the navigable portion of the rivers

6

within its borders and that it owns the avulsed beds and the

7

soil and minerals underlying the navigable portion of the

3

Arkansas River within its borders under the equal footing doc™

The map that is on page 25 of our brief may be a
little more helpful to the Court in following the argument.

11

Cherokees and shows the lands allotted to the Choctaws.

As an aid to th© Court, we

18

colored that just slightly heavier so it would be easier to

19

identify, but we so.stated in our brief so it wouldn't be con-

20

sidered misleading.
The Indian Tribes contend that through a series of

21

21

treaties commencing in 1820 and grants continuing through 1842,

23

the United States ceded to th© Indian Tribes the bed of all of

24

the streams within what is now the portion of Oklahoma that is

25

involved.
5

t

They say the United States did that for these reasons

2

The explosive development of the cotton economy around 1800

3

resulted in great pressures by the white planters upon the

4

Federal Government to move the Indians out of the Southern States.

S

At the same time, the white planters were bringing great pres-

6

sures to bear upon the Federal Government, the governments of

7

the Southern States themselves systematically harassed the

8

Indians for the purpose of making their life in the Southern

9

States unendurable.
By way of example, Georgia tore up the Federal treaties

10

n

with the Cherokees and annexed the territories of the Cherokees

12

and the Creek Nation within its territory.

13

the principal figure in the celebrated case of Rooster versus

14

Georgia, was a Presbyterian minister sentenced-to four years at

15

hard labor in a penitentiary in Georgia because he dared to

16

live on Cherokee lands without getting permission of the

17

Governor of Georgia.

Samuel Rooster,

Alabama likewise tore .up the Federal treaties with

18
19

the Choctaws.

Mississippi, by way of example, made it a peni­

20

tentiary offense for any Indian to exercise the office of Chief,

21

Mingo, Head Man or other post established by tribal customs.
;

The Louisiana Purchase of 1803-provided .a good place

.22

23

to move the Southern Indians if they could be induced to move*

24

there.

25

give up.their ancestral homes in the Southern States and move

As a part of its efforts to persuade the Indians to

6

i

fco the wild lands west of the Mississippi, the Federal Govern'

2

mnt constantly reminded them that it could not protect them

3

either from the white people in the South, or from the govern­

4

ments of the Southern States, and just as constantly it pledged

5

to these - Indian Tribes if they would give up their ancestral

6

homes in the Southern States*, that the lands to be ceded to them

7

west of the Mississippi would never be embraced in any State

8

or Territory.
The Southern Indians did move west of the Mississippi.

9
10

They did give up their ancestral homes in the Southern States,

n
m

but they did not do that because they were getting more land.
They did not do that because they were getting better land.

13

They did not do that because they were going to live under betfce r

14

conditions on the wild lands west of the Mississippi than they

15

wore in their ancestral homes.
Theyddid it for one reason, and for one reason alones

16
17

Their reliance upon the promises of the United States, given

18

to them in their negotiations with the United States, and re­

19

flected in their treaties with the United STates that if they

20

would move out of the Southern States onto the wild lands west,

21

of the Mississippi, the land ceded to them would .never be em­

22

braced in any state or Territory...
That pledge was not only reflected in the negotiations

23

24

leading

to the treaties ? it was reflected in the treaties

'25

themselves, and as a further assurance, the United States gave

7

1

to the Southern Tribes , and it gave this to no other Tribe in

2

the United States, a fee simple title to the lends west of the

the question to be resolved is simple and direct:

is no other issue before the Court.

I take it that the Choctaws were on one side -of

the river and the Cherokees on the other.
A

Yes, Your Honor.

Q

Let's assume that, in 1936, the question had come
8

1

3

up with respect to — - the Cherokees were first, weren't they?
A

No, siro

The Choctaws ware first in Oklahoma»

The Cherokees were first west of the Mississippi River,

4

Q

Who got the first grant here in Oklahoma?.

5

A

The Choctaws .

6

Q

Wells, immediately after that, if the issue came

7

up as to the ownership of the Arkansas river bed, would you say

8

the Choctaws owned the whole bed of the Arkansas River from

9

being granted land on the bank of the Arkansas River?

20

A

12

Arkansas, Your Honor,

12

Q

What was it granted?

m

A

It was granted the bed of the Arkansas,

14

Q

You mean the Choctaws were granted the bed of

15

It was not granted land on the bank of the

the Arkansas River?

16

A

Yes, sir,

17

Q

Than what did the Cherokees have to get?

28

A

There is a dispute between the Choctaws and the

?9

Cherokees as to whether the Choctaws own it all or the Cherokees

20

own half of it.

21

Q

You are saying that at least the grant to the
'

22

Cherokees and the Choctaws of land adjoining the river Carried

23

with it title to the river bad, at least to the middle?

M
25

A

No, sir; I am not saying it exactly that way.

The treaty said "down the Arkansas, up the Arkansas, where the
9

I

Arkansas border crosses the Arkansas River."

2

shall that be construed?

3

Arkansas means that you go up it to -where it becomes non-

4

navigable on one side, and then you go down it to where it is

5

navigable?

s

Q

Then we say, "How

to give some of it to the Charokees after having given land to

the Choctaws, or it didn't? one or the other.

8

away all the river bed to the Choctaws?

10

n
1.2

A

Yes, sir.

Did it convey

That would be our position.

When the

matter is re-heard in the lower courts later if we prevail here,
Q

If you were representing the Cherokees alone, I

13

suppose you would say that that language didn't convey the whole

14

river bed away.

15

16
17
18

A

Since 1 represent the Choctaws, I would not want

to have to say what I would say if I were representing —
Q

You deny that the Cherokees have any interest

in the river bed, then?

19

A

Yes, Your Honor,

We say that either —

20

Q

Because you got title to it first under the

21

same language, although the United States then tried to give it

22

away again, to the Cherokees.

23

A

Well, we don't think they tried to give it away.

24

Q

They txied to convey it away.

A

They refer to it in some of their treaties with

25

10

1

the Cherokees.

2

1 am not begging the question»

Q

In the same way they dealt with it with the

4

A

Yes, sir®

5

to give at that time.

3

CiiQCta\«?s.
And we say they didn't have anything

They had already ceded it.

6

So that brings us, I think, to this points --

7

Q

Is the center of your dispute, then, as to

8

whether the State of Oklahoma or the Indians own the bed of

9

the stream?

m

A

Yes, sir.

n

Q

If it is decided that the Indians own the bed of
}

12

the stream, then there is a further dispute, which was not

13

reached by the District Court, between the two Indian nations,

14

or the two Indian Tribes.

m

A

Yes, sir? that is entirely it.

m

Q

That is not an issue here before us.

n

A

No, sir? it is not.

is

Q

It is an issue in the sense that

in order to

19

settle the dispute between the.tribes, you would still be dealI

20

ing with the same language that wa would be dealing with here.

21

A

No, sir.

No, sir.

22

Q

Why not?

X suppose the Choctaws would rely on

23

the words of this grant, 13down the Arkansas River", carried

24

title to the bed and, therefore, the United States didn't have

25

anything more to give away.

11

1

A

That is right, sir»

2

Q

But if "clown the Arkansas" means along the

.3

Yes* sir».

Arkansas , have you lost your case?
A

4

NO* sir? 1 do not think so* because we come to
First, how shall that language, be con­

S

this question, the ns

S

strued?

7

critical thing, you see? but when you deal with Indian nations,

3

and Indian Tribes and treaties, you have to give the construc­

9

tion that is the most favorable to the Indian nation»

What shall "down the Arkansas" — because that is the

Indeed,

10

the treaty with the Choctaws specifically provided by Article

n

24 that if any reasonable doubt existed, it must ba construed

12

most favorably to the Choctaws»

13

So speaking

generieally now as the Indian Tribes, we

14

say this;

15

the Court must say it must be construed most favorably to the

16

Indian Tribes»

17

Down the. width of the Arkansas, not down one bank or the other

18
19

How shall "down the Arkansas" be construed?

Then what is the most

bank of the Arkansas»

Well,

favorable construction?

We deal with that: in our briefs»

Perhaps

that short statement is an over-simplification.

Q

20

There are some problems with that when you and

21

the Cherokee® coma to settle your problem, if that ever comes

.22

about.

23

m
25

A

Yes, sir»

We will probably knock heads on that.

Q

Must not a court reaching that problem also bear

in mind the historical background coming from the colonial times
12

t

of reservation of the title to the bed of all navigable waters?

2

!sn8t that part of the total equation?
A

3
4

Yes, sir? and 1 think Your Honor reached the

real crux of this case by that inquiry»
Where the United States held territorial lands , it.held

5
8

the beds of the navigable rivers for the benefit of a future

7

State»

But the United States during territorial status had full
i.

8

authority to convey the river bad for purposes that were appro­

3

priate to the objects for which it was held»

10

There have been

any number of decisions on that»
So then this point comes ups

11

Why -would the United

12

States have held this bed back in 1820?

13

wanted to hold the bed of the Arkansas ?. give everything all

14

around it, bat withhold not the whole Arkansas, but just the

IS

navigable portion of it?

16

State?

17
'18

What would if have

Would it be holding it for a future

They promised the Indians time after time that this
area would never be embraced in any State or Territory,

They

19

not ©rely promised it to them, they put it ire their treaties*

23

They, therefore, could not have been, in 1820, contemplating

21

that they were reserving the navigable portion of -the'-'-Arkansas

22

for the benefit of a future ntate.

23
24
25

Would it have been reserving it for the minerals that
ware ire it?

It gave the Indian Tribes all the minerals that

lay above the navigable portion.

Why would it hold it for the

13

1

navigable portion?

2

Why would it want the avulsed beds of the Arkansas when it was

3

giving all the lands on both sides to the Indian Tribes,

4

Q

Why would it want the avulsed beds in 1820?

If we accept your argument, Mr* Kile, would that

5

mean that if the Indian Tribes controlled both banks and the

6

bed, forgetting for a moment which triba claimed which part,

7

they could exact a toll, for example, for boats using that

8

navigable stream?

9
10
11
12

A

Wo, sir, because under the commerce clause to the

Constitution, the United States always has and controls the
navigation of all the navigable waters in the United States *
Q

If we apply literally your argument to what the

13

Indians had a reason to believe, the Indians may have thought

14

they were going to have control of that navigable stream under

‘15

the language of that treaty, as I read it*

16
17
18

A

No, sir.

The language of the 'treaties •— and we

mention that in.our brief — reserved the navigation easement,
and it does so in a rather specific way.

It says that United

19

States, that the Choctaws shall have the right to use it just

20

like any other people have.

21
,22
23
24

S3

In the treaty with the Cherokees„

they specifically provided that the United states would have the
right to use the river to supply its forts, its post offices,
and its post roads.
So all the United States did, and the United States
did that in its .treaties with the Indians, and we point that
14

t

out in our brief, that they reserved a navigation easement.

2

They have always exercised it.

They exercised it long after

3

the Indians moved to Oklahoma.

They exercised it, in fact,

4

until the railroads same.
Q

5

6

States?

8

n
12
13

Yes, sir? subject to the regulations of the

United States.

9
10

Would they be able to use that navigable water freely?
A

7

What about other citizens, other than the United

Q

But not subject to any limitation by the Indian

A

No, sir.

Tribes?
The Indian Tribes could not impose any

limitation on it.
My time is rather brief, but I should like to call

14

the Court's attention to the reliance in three cases that

IS

Oklahoma relies on.

IQ

Court of Oklahoma, and in none of these decisions, I would say,

17
IS
!9
20
21

22
23

24
25

Two of them were decisions of the Supreme

ware the Indian Tribes represented, or was the Government repre­
sented on behalf of the Indian Tribes in any of these cases,
nor were these treaties brought to the attention of the Court.
The two Oklahoma decisions are predicated upon the
belief of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and the stated belief
of the State of Oklhaoma, that the bed of the river was being
held for the benefit of a future State.

If it was the intention

of the United States and the Indian Tribes in the early 18005s
that this area would never be embraced in any State, then the
15

i

•premise upon which the decisions of the Supreme-Court of Okla­

2

homa are bottomed are false.

3

There is one case, and counsel for Oklahoma must com­

4

ment on it at great length„ and he must try to show that it is

S

related to the facts in this case, and I challenge him that he

0

will not be able to do so, and that is United States versus

7

Holt State Bank, which is a decision of this Court,

8

Holt State Bank arose in Minnesota,

9

when the Chippewa5s

ceded their aboriginal lands to the United States, reserving to

19

themselves a right of occupancy within a certain area. ' The'

11

Chippewas were the granting party.

12

and that distinguishes and interdicts the application of Holt

13

State Bank to this case, because incur case the United States was

They were the moving party,

i

the granting party.
In Holt State Bank, this Court said of the Chippewas,

16

if they had wanted to keep the bad of Mud Lake, they should have

17

made some precision for it in their session to the United States

18

But when the teaching of United States versus Holt State Bank

19

is applied to the facts in our case, than we submit that this

29

Court would have said, had the United States, being the granting

21

party, wanted to reserve th© bed of the Arkansas River, then it

22

should have excepted it from its grant.

23

We say to the Court that there was no grant moving

24

from the United States to the Chippewas in Holt State Bank.
