ARGUMENT OF RICHARD R. LYMAN, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

S

e

MR. LYMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, honorable Justices,

i

this is a case which comes before this Court to review a

8

judgment of the Court of Appeals below which partially reverses

9

and partially affirms a District Court judgment granting motions

10

to dismiss the complaint.

The Plaintiffs in this case were

1!

four employees of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad Company, which

iZ

is the railroad formed as the result of a merger of the former

13

Erie Railroad and the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western

14

Railroad.
That merger* took place in 1960, and in 1962 the

15

16

Plaintiffs in the allegations of their complaint, which of

17

course control the facts for our situation here, were

18

furloughed from their employment as stationary engineers.

19

They alleged in the complaint several different theories of

20

action.

21

result of the merger of the railroads was a violation of the

22

Interstate Commerce Act.

23

the implementing agreement with that specification as to what

24

the implementing agreement provided for, or what provisions

25

were relied upon.

They contend that that furlough being allegedly as a

They allege it was a violation of

They alleged that it was further violative
3

!

t

of the Railway Labor Act. in that they did not receive thirty-

2

days advance written notice of the fact that they were going

3

to be furloughed.

4

compensation for their severance from employment, or severance

5

pay, to which they say they were entitled by the Interstate

6

Commerce Act and the implementing agreement.

1

the furlough constituted a wrongful discharge because they were

S

not subsequently recalled from the furlough, or had not been up j

9

until the time of the suit, which was filed in 1967.

iO

They alleged that they received no

|

They assert that

They predicate jurisdiction on diversity of

11

citizenship and jurisdictional amounts on the Interstate

12

Commerce Act, Section 5, et. seq„, and on the Railway Labor Act.

13

There was ro specification of anything in the Interstate

14

Commerce Act upon which they were relying to give rise to

15

this action.

m

to the Railway Labor Act was this thirty day notice provision,

The only specific jurisdictional allegation as

Finally, in addition to all of these various

'17

18

allegations, they allege that their union failed and refused

13

to process the grievance and collect compensation for them

20

after they had been furloughed or wrongfully discharged, as

21

the case may be, and they say that this failure to process the

22

grievance amounted to hostile discrimination, bad faith, and

23

so forth.

24

She District Court sustained the motions to dismiss

25

that, were filed by both Defendants, finding that there was no

4

j

1

diversity of citizenship.

The Defendant, Erie Lackawanna,

2

is a New York corporation, and the only union defendants that

3

were sued were also residents of New York State.

4

that there was no basis for such an action or for jurisdiction

It found

under the Interstate Commerce Act in that they were not

6

relying on any provision of that Act, or claiming any provision;

7

of the statute had been violated, and that the only thing they

8

were basically suing on was the implementing agreement.
As to the Railway Labor Act, they said that the

9
10

Adjustment Board had exclusive jurisdiction of the contract

II

claim.

n

to properly represent them, the District Court ruled that

13

although the Plaintiffs used the phrase "hostile discrimination '

14

in alleginc that they failed to process their claims properly,

15

the use of that phrase alone would not support jurisdiction

16

under the Failway Labor Act as an unfair representation claim.

17

The District Court further pointed out that the Plaintiffs were

18

not attacking the validity of any collective bargaining

19

agreement, and they were not claiming that they could not

20

personally pursue their administrative remedies to enforce the!

21

contract rights under that agreement.

With respect to the charge that the union had failed

22

After that ruling by the District Court, Plaintiffs

23

did not seek leave to file an amended complaint or attempt to

24

file one, but instead appealed from the decision of the District

25

Court.

Thus all wa have in the record before the Court to

5

1

support the factual questions involved are the complaints,,

2

the two motions to dismiss, plus so-called affidavits that

3

were filed with the District Court in connection with those

4

motions to dismiss .
The union defendants, petitioners here, filed a

5
6

regular motion to dismiss the complaint based on lack of

7

jurisdiction of the subject matter, and failure to state a

3

claim, and filed no supporting affidavits, so that it was an

9

ordinary motion to dismiss,.

j

to

The railroad!, motion was supported by an affidavit

11

of counsel which appears at page 12 of the appendix, which

12

did reflect some facts.

13

paragraph of the page, states the railroad's version of the

14

facts out of which the dispute arose.

On page 13, the second complete

The Plaintiffs' attorney filed his ovra affidavit

15

IS

in oppositi.on to the motions to dismiss, appearing on page 15

17

of the appendix, in which he does not state any facts, simply

13

recites what he contended the nature of the action to be, and

19

then recited, and I quote, "that the Plaintiffs do not have to

20

allege facts or damages in their complaint under the Federal

21

Rules."

22

Following this decision of the District Court,

23

Plaintiffs1 appeal, the Court of Appeals held the complaint

24

was suffici.ent to state a Federal claim against the union

25

defendants for breach of the duty of fair representation.
6

But

1

as to the railroad defendant, it sustained the District Court's

2

dismissal of the complaint for the reason that Plaintiffs had

3

to assert their claim for wrongful discharge against the

4

railroad exclusively before the National Railroad Adjustment.

3

Board, and further sustained the District Court’s other findings

6

as to the lack of any substance in the various other

7

jurisdictional allegations of the complaint,

We would contend not, because in the Landmark

12

case, the decision of this court in Vaca against Sipes, one of

13

the basic elements which an employee must sustain in action

'14

against his; union for unfair representation is that his claim

13

against the company is a good one on the merits.

points up, Mr. Justice, the problem and dilemma the Court of

17

Appeals left us in.

They normally do.

It would depend upon whether

the contract entitled the man to do it or not.
C

But if the Board said the only place you can

get a remedy for reinstatement is from the employer, the union

<5

certainly could not reinstate him, but we think the only

10

reason the employer fired this man is because of a result of

It

the union's hostility, not because the employer wanted it, but

12

the union wanted the employer to, we will not award him back

13

pay against the employer; let him recover that from the union.

Would you think it would be improper under the

law for the Board to deny full back pay?
P.

Under your Honors8 decision in Vaca against

Sipes, if part of his damages were attributable to the union's
action, the union of course should be assessed with that
liability, in a pro rating process.

against Sipes, you pointed out that there is a little different

situation presented when, as in this case, the charge of unfair

representation is based on failure to process a grievance which

is caused by a completely unrelated independent breach of

12

contract by the employer.

If it is, there is very little left of the

part cf Rule 12 that authorizes the dismissal of complaints

for failure- to state a claim.

We are not contending that

13

detailed facts, common law pleading, technicalities must be

14

observed, but there must be a pleading in idle complaint of the

15

basis for the charge that is being made, even though it is not

artfully drawn.

The complaint does allege hostile discriminatxoi

18

It alleges the pure conclusion, but alleges

19

nothing except the mere failure to process the grievance.

But on the pleading question again, in

18

addition to what Justice White has referred to, about the

19

allegation of claim of hosti1 discrimination, there is an

20

explicit allegation that the union breached its duty to the

21

Plaintiff as a member and violated the collective bargaining

22
23
24

agreement by not representing him in -die claim against the
railroad.

Do you say that is not enough to raise the issue?
h

The allegation that they did not represent them

and prosecute their claim is a factual allegation.
13

The other

?

is not. the allegation of any fact, but a conclusion, and

2

again relying upon Vaca against Sipes, the mere failure to

3

represent and process is not sufficient.

4

malicious, bad faith failure to represent or process.

cannot be held to any standards of competence, such as a

sort of thing.

A union

There are cases which have held, I don't think

in this Court, but there are cases in Courts of Appeals which

10

have held that the relationship between the union and its

>1

members is in the nature of a fiduciary relationship.

S2

h

We agree, and were some factual basis alleged,

13

other than these bare statements, showing that that fiduciary

14

relationship sas breached, showing an act which by its nature

JS

would breach .it, then it would be a different question.

16

If the Court please, I would like to reserve a few

17

minutes for rebuttal unless the Court has some further

18

questions that they wish to ask now.

18

Q

Could I ask you just one question?

20

a collective bargaining agreement.

21

bargaining agreement?

22

was it not?

23

h

There is

Was there a collective

This was in connection with a merger,

Yes, Mr. Justice.

There of course is always

24

the so-called schedule agreement on these railroads, setting

25

forth the basic rates of pay, rules and working conditions.
.i. 4

i

Then there was an implementing agreement to implement: the

2

merger.

3

()

Is there a provision in any of the agreements

4

which indicates that the union has a duty, a contractual duty

5

to represent the employee before the Adjustment Board?

S

A

Hot that I know of.

The railroad unions in

7

general have maintained the proposition that they may take

©

’
employees1 claims to the Adjustment Board, or they may advise

9

them, "We don't think this is a claim that has much merit, but

to

you are free to take it yourselves if you want to, but we won't

11

do it at union expense."

12
13

Q
Let us assume the union freely admits that it
;;
is a good claim but it just says, "We don't normally undertake

14

this", the employee is permitted to go before the Board by the

15

lav;, and let him go by himself.

IS
17

A

Yes, your Honor.

I

I think the union can lawfully

do that, and perhaps the remedy for that, if the employee
}

18

wanted more extensive representation and activity by his union

19

representative, is to choose another union that will give if.

20

to him if 1 e would not get it from that union.

21

C?

!

Under the bargaining agreement, are the

22

pre-Board sfceps of the grievance procedure operable by the

employee himself without the union's cooperation?

It was the contention of the employees, and they made; this

13

to bring it to the Court's attention, with the Court's

permission —- they brought this situation to the attention of

parties was that they were not affected employees with respect

18

to the merger, that the reason they lost their jobs, or to use

the word "furlough", as the other counsel used it, was because

20

of theobsolescence of this Michigan Avenue Power Plant.

21

The answer that they received from both

How, in the lower courts, in the District Court,

22

and in the Court of Appeals, both the attorneys for the union

23

and the attorneys for the railroad indicated that these men

24

had not lost their jobs, that they were just furloughed.,

Of

course, this is almost eight years later, and they still called

19

My reading of cases in the Second Court of Appeals in New York,

20

particularly the Cunninghams case, indicates that when a

21

plaintiff has a claim against the union for unfair

representation, and also connected with that would have a

practice is not to disassociate the claim to make the plaintiffs,

wouldn't it?

7

A

That is my understanding of the law, also.

8

Q

What if the railroad says,

I insist on taking

this to the Board"?

That would be the first time that the railroad

has said that, then, because there was no allegation before

that they could have brought it to the Board.

That is the reason X did not want to go to the

MR. GRIFFIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the

2©

Court, may it please the Court, on behalf of the Erie

21

Lackawanna,

22

is our position that we had a right to have the question of

23

this matter of whether the furloughing or discharge was right

24

or wrong, whether it had anything to do with the merger..

25

Basically this is a question of an interpretation of agreements,

t
the respondent employer in the case, basically it

25

!

i

1

and that under the Railway Labor Act the design of that is

2

that where agreements are interpreted in this type of dispute

the Natione,1 Railroad Adjustment Beard is the one to interpret !

the agreements, and accordingly the Plaintiffs had an

obligation to take the case there.

In part that is my purpose, your Honor, yes.

It is uiy position that the gratuitous non-asked-for permission

A
your Honor.

It is a good question, and I am frank to say,
X am not able to authoritatively respond.

At the

time, that the petition on behalf of the union was filed, I do
recall that, in our office we went into that thing, and it is

27

‘3

my impression — I could be wrong -- that we determined at

2

that time that if certiorari was granted by this Court on the

union's application, then the Court "would have the power,

Because you did not petition?

That, is right.

Is that it?

I was originally a defendant;

in the District Court, and an appellee in the —
Q

You wanted to sustain the District Court's

judgment of dismissal.

13

A

That is correct, your Honor.

14

Q

The Court of Appeals reversed the District

15

Court, and you objected to that.

16

A

That is correct,

17

Q

You and the union argued together in the Court

18

of Appeals.

19

A

That is correct.

We were there to sustain

20

Judge Henderson, the District Judge's decision that there was

21

no case, ir. effect, that we should be out 100 per cent.

22

the Second Circuit in effect sustained that on the basis of

23

the case in pleadings before it, but as I say gratuitously

24-

gave leave for the plaintiffs to start, in effect, another

23

lawsuit against us.

I think we are entitled without question to address ourselves

to, that is whether the railroad should be in the case at all,

23
24
25

Mr. Lyman, you have three

minutes left.

16

20

Thank you.

Q

Why did you make the railroad a respondent?

h

Because the Court of Appeals left us as the

sole defendants to defend against a charge or claim for
damages based on the acts of the railroad company, and not on
our acts.

If the railroad had not been made respondents, they

are out of it, and we have to share their burden according to
the .drift of the -Q

Your complaint, is that instead of limiting the
31

1

relief to the employees to amend on grounds of collusion against

z

the railrocd, you wanted the railroad what, made something else'/

3

Were you challenging the judgment as to the extent to which fchej

4

railroad is kept in, or what?

5

A

Under Vaca against Sipes, the Court made it
.

a

very clear that the railroad cannot slough its burden on paying

7

for its wrcngful breach of contract, off onto the labor union

8

simply in z situation where, like here, the union did not

3

process the claim for the employees to complain about what the

SO

n

railroad had done.
C:

Let me see if I get it.

Your point is you want

12

out entirely on the pleading argument that there is no cause of

13

action against the union.

14

A

Yes.

S3

Q

But if one has been, then you are entitled to

16
17

have the employer in as a full co-defendant, is that it?
A

Yes, because their damages cannot properly be
i

IS
19

placed upon the union.

Now, the leave to amend to allege

i

collusion that the Court of Appeals granted to plaintiffs does

20

>
not save us, because on a remand, suppose first they may not

2!

amend, and may decide they would rather just go against us.

22
Then we are. out.

We are lost.

If they do amend and then the

23

District Court finds there was no cdlusion, as there is no

24

i
!

i

suggestion inthis case that there was, except in the Court of
.25

Appeals idea that maybe that is the kind of an action that
32

i

1

that is the kind of an action that could be brought jointly,

‘3
ijlM

and that if there were no collusion, they could not be sued,

*>'

if they do amend and bring the railroad back in, suppose the

4

railroad gets out on maybe ever?, a summary judgment showing

S

there is no shadow of support for the charge of collusive

s

action, then the case would be left, in the same posture that:

7

it is now where a purely independent act of breach of contract

8

by the railroad is being defended solely by the union,

i
■

i
■

C

One thing that does emerge here is that the

10

Court of Appeals thought that these pleadings stated a cause

11

of action against the union.

12

that, whether correctly or not,,

13

A

That is clear that they thought

Yes, your Honor, and we submit that they die'
