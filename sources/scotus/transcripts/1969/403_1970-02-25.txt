ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, SOLICITOR

GENERAL OF THE U. S. ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. GRISWOLD:

9

May it please the Court:

This is a

criminal case here on certiorari from the United States Court

10

ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit.

11

novel question under the Fourth Amendment with respect to

12

search and seizure.

13

It involves an interesting and

The underlying facts in this case occurred on March

14

28th and 29th, 1968.

IS

at 1:30 p.rn., at the United States Post Office at Mt. Vernon

IS

in the State of Washington, the Respondent appeared and de­

17

posited for mailing, two heavy packages, 12 pounds each.

18

is relevant that the Post Office in Mt. Vernon, Washington is

19

in the western part of the State of Washington, and about 60

20

miles south of the Canadian border.

21

On that day, not quite two years ago,

It

One of these packages was addressed to a post office

22

box in Van Nuys, California, and the other to a post office

23

box in Nashville, Tennessee.

24

neighboring town, adjacent to Mt. Vernon.

25

the air mail rate and the packages were registered and insured

Both bore a return address in a

2

Postage was paid at

1

each one for $10,000, a total of $20,000 for the two and in

2

response to a request from the post office clerk, it was de~

3

dared that they contained coins or a coin collection.

4

The post office clerk was suspicious and he immediate] Y

5

advised an officer of the Mt. Vernon police who happened to

6

be in the lobby, of his suspicions, and Captain Belgard of the

7

Mt, Vernon police observed the car departing and noticed that

8

it had British Columbia license plates.

9

examined and the police captain and the post office clerk were

10

The package was then

both aware of the fact that the address given on the package
was of a nearby junior college, of quarters which had been

12

unoccupied for several weeks.

13

Q

That v^as the addressee or the return address?

14

A

The return address.

S

Captain Belgard then, perhaps somewhat surprisingly,

18

telephoned the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and not the U. S.

17

Customs or the

18

Vancouver and it was the Canadian police who put in a call to

10

Mr. O'Hearn, the Customs Officer-in-Charge at Seattle,

20

Washington.

21
22
23

but he telephoned the Canadian police in

And the details, so far as they were know, were thus
transmitted to Mr. O8Hearn in Seattle.
By this timeit was about 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon

24

and Mr. O’Hearn then put in a telephone call to the Customs

25

Off* -.e in Van Nuys in California and he was advised that the
3

1

addressee of the package being sent there was under investiga­

2

tion for dealing in illegal coins.,

3

pleted that call it was beyond the closing time in Nashville,

4

which I believe is three hours in advance of Seattle; it may

5

be two.

By the time he had com­

And Mr. O'Hearn then delayed until the following

He got similar information from the Customs Officer

7

8

in Nashville.

I believe he had to do that through Mobile, as

9

a matter of fact, since the headquarters was in Mobile.

10

Mr. 0*Hearn then prepared the affidavit for a search

11

warrant x^hich appears on page 5 of the record and, of course,

12

the preparation of that took time, both for composition and for

13

typing.

14

in Seattle and that, of course, took time to find the Commis­

IS

sioner free from other responsibilities and to give him time

16

for consideration.

17

It was then presented to the United States Commissione r

At 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the following day,

18

March 9th the Commissioner issued a search warrant in Seattle.

19

No%tf, Seattle is some 60 miles south of Mt. Vernon and Mr.

20

O'Hearn took the search warrant to Mt. Vernon and there served

21

it at 6:30 p.m. on March 29th, which is about 29 hours after

22

the events first began when the package was deposited in the

23
24
25

post office in Mt. Vernon.

And the problem arises because the

package was held in Mt. Vernon and was not forwarded at once
through usual United States Post Office channels.

4

1

When the warrant was served, the packages were found '

2

to contain several, hundred gold coins.

3

resealed, sent on to the addressee; they were refused by the

4

addressees and were returned to the Post Office in Mt. Vernon.

5

The packages ware

How, other evidence at the trial shows that the

6

Respondent had, in fact, imported these coins.

7

motion to suppress the evidence of the gold coins which was

8

denied by the District Court.

9

a violation of the customs laws in having imported the coins

10

without the proper declaration and an appeal was taken to the

If

Court of Appeals before the Ninth Circuit.

\Z

There was a

The Respondent was convicted of

Now, that court held that the evidence should have

13

been suppressed on the grounds that the delay in holding the

14

coins in Mt. Vernon for 29 hours was unreasonable and a

IS

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

IS

which is now before the Court on the Government’s petition

f?

for certiorari.

18

And that is the sole issue

Before going further, let me simply recall the simple

19

words of the Fourth Amendment: "The right of the people to be

20

secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against

21

unreasonable searches axid seizures shall not be violated and

22

no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause supported by

23

oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to

24

be searched and the persons or things to be seized."

25

Now, here of course , a warrant was received on
5

1

probable cause and supported by oath or affirmation and

2

particularly describing the place to be searched and the per­

3

sons or things to be seised»

4

without a warrant»

pw

This is not a case of search

Here there was a search with a warrant,,

The problem arises because the police officers were

careful.

7

facts, and because the post office employee cooperated in that

8

process, by holding the package at Mt„ Vernon, Washington.

9

They took the time to be sure they had the proper

Now, it could, of course, be said that once the

to

package was in the custody of the post office it should have

n

been sent on and somehow or other the officers could have

12

followed it and kept track of it and before it was actually

13

delivered at the respective destinations these various in­

14

quiries could have been made.

15

The logistic and manpower problems involved in that,

16

the numberof people required in at least three or four dif­

17

ferent locations or such? it seems to me to make that approach

18

not a reasonable requirement under all circumstances.

19

Now, there is an aspect of this case which seems to

20

me to be of very considerable importance.

Last June this

21

Court decided the ChiEiel case, and curiously enough, also in­

22

volving coins.

24

And in the Chimel case some of

arrest, were sharply cut down»
And there is a consequence of the Chime1 case which

3

I assume is going to have to be presented in later cases.

4

That is the extent to which granting that the police cannot

5

conduct an extensive search and seizure in the premises in­

6

cident to an arrest. To what extent can the police officers

7

impose a still stand on the situation: lock the door, keep

8

people from entering and leaving, prevent people inside the

9

premises from destroying evidence while they go through the

10

necessary process, obviously requiring under current condi­

11

tions , several hours of preparing a warrant

12

for a search warrant under — in many cases this will require

13

not merely the police officer, but participation by the lawyer

14

and the Assistant United States Attorney or appropriate state

15

officer, typing, finding a magistrate, submitting it to him

18

and giving him an opportunity to consider it and then upon

17

its issuance, the opportunity to search.

19

still stand — not to seize, but simply to hold things in the

2Q

21

destroyed and the opportunity to make an effective search will

22

evaporate.

23

The evidence in many of these cases will be

Now, that is not this case? this has nothing to do

24

with a search incident to an arrest.

25

ever where post office employees in association with other

7

This is a situation, how­

1

governmental officers, did preserve the situation and the

2

statue quo by not sending on the package in the normal pro­

3

cesses ofthe U. So Mail*

4

I would point out, too, in the consideration of this

5

matter, as turning on the reasonableness of their action, that

6

there was no communication involved here;

there is no letter.

7

There is no transmission of intelligence.

This was simply

8

goods; simply gold coins.

9

livery of a package is not unprecedented and there is nothing

10

to indicate that it was a matter of any seriousness to anyone

11

involved.

12

The dealv of 29 hours in the de­

Now, it's curious, though I suppose, explainable be­

13

cause of the development of —- the recent development of

14

cases like Chime! that it’s curious that it's almost impossible

15

to find any indication in the decisions in this Court or

16

elsewhere of the extent to which the police may take steps to

17

preserve the status quo while warrants are being obtained.

18

Back a generation ago in Taylor against the United

19

States, this Court pointed out that a short period of watching

20

"during the time required to secure a search warrant, could

21

have prevented the possibility of any change in the premises,

22

from which Government agents had smelled the odor of whiskey."

23

i

And in the Trupiano case in 334 U.S., the Court,

24

striking down a search without a warrant, noted that a warrant

25

could have been obtained without the risk of removal, since
8

\

2

one of the agents, and I quote: "Was on hand at all times to

2

report and guard against such a move."

3

Wow, there were no issues in those cases as to the

4

validity of .a restraint which might have been imposed while

5

the warrant was being obtained, but the Court in those cases

6

seemed to feel that such a restraint would have been not only

7

natural and understandable, but justifiable.

8
9
10

Q

You could have gotten a warrant and seized the

package on the other end of the shipment, I suppose.
A

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I mentioned that in stating tfhe

11

facts, but the problems of tracing and keeping track of and

12

the number of people involved and frankly, I don't know whether

13

a warrant issued by a United States Commissioner in Seattle

14

is valid in Van Nuys, California, or in Nashville, Tennessee?

15

whether it might not have had to be presented to a Commissioner

16

in those places.

n

now pressed, I believe, is that it was based on hearsay and

18

on facts not within the knowledge of the affiant, will, of

13

course be far more extreme as you got two officers in Califor­

20

nia and in Nashville, Tennessee.

21

None of the charges against this warrant, not

It would haveinvolved a

great many more people and our position is that the limited

22

delay in this case, not six months; not a week, 29 hours, not

23

much more than overnight, was not unreasonable under the cir­

24

cumstances, particularly when it was the consequence of the

25

fact that the officers were trying to do their duty carefully
9

1

and thoughtfully; were seeking to obtain a search warrant;

2

were trying to discover the facts so that if there was no

3

basis for a warrant it would not be obtained and our view is

4

that to impose a requirement that you must send the things on

5

and then try to catch them before they are delivered v/ould be

©

too technical, would require too much expenditure of manpower,

7

too much risk of loss,? when the suspected material is in the

a

custody of the United States, and rightly so.
This period seems to us to have been a reasonable

A

Well, Mr» Justice, I have thought about that

16

argument and I'm not sure that I can say that gold coins as

17

such are contraband.

Q

But if you were sustained here; your position

is sustained, what happens to the coins?
A

Are they forfeited?

I believe they would be forfeited under the

customs laws, Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

Is it illegal to possess gold coins now., quite

apart from the customs laws?
A

Well, Mr. Justice, I understand that there are

8

exceptions to the gold statutes and regulations under which

9

coins bona fidely held for collection purposes are perfectly

10

legal; indeed, I see them advertised in the papers and I think

11

that for §95 you can now buy a $20 gold piece which —

12

Q

I thought there was a time, almost a generation

13

ago when everybody was required to turn in all these gold

14

coins and thereafter it was illegal to possess them.

15

16
17

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, but there was an exception

of bona fide collectors items, whether they -Q

Well, I'm happy to hear that, because I was

Well, that raises all kinds of questions about

self-incrimination that I don't think we need to go into.here.
In some ways the case which seems to me to be the

24

closest is the Terry case.

years ago.

Terry against Ohio decided two

24

Because he did there

It's true that he was using it as an argument that
the search without a warrant should be valid and he was in the
minority on that and we are not contending here that a search
without a warrant is valid.

But on page 774 of Justice White's,

dissent, he said: "When there must almost always be a strong
possibility that confederates of the arrested man will, in the
meanwhile, remove the items for which the police have probable
cause for search."
And on page 775 he says: "However, had the police
simply arrested petitioner and taken him off to the stationhouse and later- returned with a warrant it seems very likely
that the petitioner's wife, who, in view of petitioner's
generally gariulcus nature, must have known of the robbery,
could have removed the coins."
Now, our position is that — our contention, our
suggestion is that that argument not having prevailed, never­
theless remains open this question which I call "The oppor­
tunity to impose the still stand.”

Now, just how that can be

done, what manpower would be involved, what force can properly
be used, remains to be seen, but vie contend here that in a
different situation where the goods are already in the custody

25

12

1

of the United States,, having been confined to the — confided

2

to the United States Mail,, that it is appropriate for the

3

officers of the government to preserve the status quo while

4

the warrant is being carefully and thoughtfully obtained.

5

Now„ I would like to refer to the Terry case itself,

6

because that is a case which goes into these questions of un­
reasonable search and seizure, the meaning of an unreasonable

7

where we do not have an arrest or a seizure involved.

8

In the Terry case you will remember the problem ’was

9

of the powerof the police to take action, short of an arrest by

10

way of what is popularly known as "stop and frisk," by way of

11

patting a man’s clothes to see whether he was armed and on

12

finding a hard object, reaching in and removing it,

13

And in

that opinion Chief Justice Warren discussed at some length the

14

difference between the cause required to obtain a search

15

warrant which would be probable — or an arrest warrant it

16

would be in that case —• probable cause to believe that a crime

17

has been committed and the cause which was required for a

18

police officer to take this interlocutory step.

1©

And it really comes down to this: whether there was

20

probable cause for suspicion with respect to the commission of

21

a crime and the safety of the police officers.

22

I won't take the time to quote from that opinion,

23

particularly on pages 21 to 24, only by way of analogy, but by

24

considerable analogy there

discussion of this shorter

25
13
I

1

step, this step short of an arrest or a seizure, and we feel

2

that there is substantial support in the Terry case for the

3

proposition that the steps taken here and the only steps

4

against which plaintiffs made is the holding of the package

5

for 29 hours and it would have had to be held for a substantial

6

portion of that, at the very best, that that was not unreason­

7

able .

Q

Mr. Solicitor, I gather the justification in

Terry that was emphasised was the safety of the officer;

wasn’t it?

ft

A

Yes, Mr. Justice,

12

Q

Do we have anything comparable to that in this

13

situation?

14

A

No? there is no question of safety here, but

15

it is suggested that the only duty of a post office clerk is

16

to send the package on forthwith and I suggest that if, on

that he has some duty other than sending —*
Q

Well, what I6m getting at is: I wonder if the

result reached in Terry would have been reached if that factor
of the safety of the officer was not involved,
A

I think perhaps not,

Te-rry is a precise analogy,

I’m not suggesting that

I am suggesting that it is an

application of a determination of what is reasonable conduct
14

1

under the circumstances and our suggestion is that in this

case, not involving a communication and nothing about the

First Amendment, simply goods in transit that could delay them

for a day in the process of being careful, in seeking a search

warrant and then seeking the search warrant through the judg­

6

ment of an independent magistrate is not such unreasonable

conduct as to violate the Fourth Amendment.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY CRAIG G. DAVIS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

MR. DAVIS:

22

May it please the Court, and Mr. Chief

23

Justice:

I find this argument most interesting as presented?

Why is

it reasonable?
These packages are placed with the United States

Post Office in a form of trust.

Our mail system, our whole

system of communications in the United States would breakdown

without that trust and I submit that there’s been a violation

of statutory law laid down by the Congress and of regulations

And I know that I,- as a

taxpayer, if I violate a title of the Taxes or any of the

regulations, I stand a chance to be here on the regulations

It takes air-mail, from my brief, to xeach this

would imagine three days; to reach Mobile, Alabama.

And if the Government just hadn't seised them

at the point of origin, but it seized them at their destination
they would have had their warrant by then and they would then,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,
SOLICITOR GENERAL, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GRISWOLD;
like to make.

I have just two points that I would

Mr. Davis has referred to the statute which

requires the mail, as he has said, to be forwarded promptly.
Actually, the statute is printed at the bottom of page 2 of

U
the appendix to his brief, SEofcion 710 of Title 39 of the

IS
United States Code, and it reads;

"Letters brought for mailing

16
to a post office, and so forth, shall be sent on" — and this
17
was not a letter.

I don’t regard this of any great importance,

18

/

but I do not think there waggny violation of that statute in
19
this case.

20
And the other point I would like to make is
21
Q

Is there a penalty for failure to do that?

A

No? it’s an internal housekeeping part of the

22
23
post office statute, a direction to postal employees.

There

24
are other statutory provisions which make it a crime with
kli

37

1

penalties attached to interfere with the mails, but I under­

a

stand them to be directed to outsiders,, to persons who ob-

3

struct the mails in one wav or another, and not to postal

4

employees.

j

Now, the other point that I would like to make is

simply this:

that the warrant was not obtained on March 26th, rather than
on March 29th.

I think it could be that a warrant could have

been obtained on March 28th and I don’t think I would have too
much difficulty in seeking to defend it here if it had been.
I would point cut that the information then available

IZ

it would seem that Mr. Davis's real complaint is

related to only oneof the packages, which might have been
enough to establish a crime, but not enough to seise the other
package.

What I would hope would be that the Court would leave

a little leeway here, and not to set up a rule which would
mean that the instant you really now have enough, you must then
and there go and get it, because the lines are not easy to
draw here.

They are hard to draw long after the srents in the

calm deliberation of this court.

They are much harder to draw

for the individual officer On the scene that has to decide
whether, "what if I go in now, will it be found that I didn't
have enough?"
Here the officer was careful.

He did no harm in the

23
24

process of being careful.

And it seems tome he ought to be

commended for having done a fine work and that the delay which
as
38

was involved was reasonable and should not be held to in­

z

validate the seizure in this case,
