ORAL ARGUMENT BY

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR» WINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;

§

view a procurement order of the Court of Appeals of the District

10

of Columbia, which enforced a supplemental order of the National

11

Labor Relations Board.

12

This case is before the Cot

: on certiorari to re­

The Board8s order was entered against Petitioner,

Rklations Act.
More specifically, the company was found to have
refused to agree tofche union's demand for a huge check-off
provision for the purpose of frustrating an agreement .with the
.•••'
''
•'
/
union.
The Board's supplemental order,which is the focal
point of this controvery before this Court, requires the company
to, and I quotes

"Grant to the union a contract clause pro­

viding for the check-off of union dues."

The very precise and

very clear-cut issue now presented is whether the Board, under
the National Labor Relations Act, has the power to order a

1

party to agree to a substitute provision of a collective

2

bargaining agreement.

3

position that the Board does not have such power.

4

now says that it has the power to order agreement through a

5

subsfcitute provision„

The company, of course, take the
The Board

6

The bargaining —

7

Q

Well, what substitute provision?

8

A

The substitute provision, Mr, Justice Black,

9

was a huge check-off provision — a provision, of course, in a

70

collective bargaining agreement by which the .com])any aids and

11

12

assists the union in the collection of dues by do
ng union
/
dues fromthe employee's wages and then transit them to the

13

union.

14
15
16

Q

In other words, the Board said :hat this was a

demand of the union to which the company must agree?
A

The way the case worked out, Mr,, Chief Justice

17

is actually worked that way.

18

if I may sa* so, the instigator of the remedy here, as to what

19

has occurred.

SO
21

22

The Court of Appeal.s is actually

This

Thi.s case went through the Examiner; the Examiner
went through the general bargaining order.

The case then went

up to the Board; the Board adopted the general bargaining order

23

it want to the District of Columbia Circuit; the District of

24

Columbia Circuit enforced and refused the union's request for

25

a direct order, which we are now arguing about, which was later

4

1

entered.

But, on the first time up, the District of Columbia

2

rejected the union’s position; the District of columbi.a Circuitj

3

Court .
Then, after that occurred, we filed

4

a petition for j

5

certiorari with this Court.

6

of the wording used in the opinion, it seemed to us that the

7

Court of Appeals was tailing us: "If you want to avoid contempt

0

you had better agree without any further talking."

We took the position that because

Well, when this Court denied our petition for cert,

9
10

we then took the interpretation which we felt we had tounder

11

tho lav/, as we interpret the law, that the general bargaining

12

order required us to bargain over a dues collecting system, but

13

not simply to walk in and agree.
The union took the position at the subsequent

14
15

16
'»7

negotiations that, "No, Porter, you are required to agree and
we don’t have to talk to you any more about it.

Q

A

25

It suggested it, and in order to avoid con­

tempt, the Court could not see how we could avoid agreeing,
Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we then got into the posi­

22
23

Well, didn't the original opinion of the Court

of Appeals suggest that very thing?

20
21

You are re­

quired to agree to a dues check-off provision."

m
19

I

tion

vergent interpretations of this original bargining

order, and the union then asked the Board to initiate a contempt
proceeding.

The Board's regional director advised the parties
5
1

1

that the company had now complied with the bargaining order and

2

that the case was thereby closed *
\

3

|

The union,, then, filed a motion for clarification

5

:

with the District of Columbia Circuit Court.

Tbs First time the

the Circuit Court denied the motion for clarification and said,

6 i

"We think contempt is the proper route to test compliance."

|

Then the union went back to the Court of Appeals

7

e
9

with a second motion, asking for reconsideration of the earlier
»
motion.

This time the Court of Appeals came out with an.

10

opinion and the Court, remanded the case to the Board, and

11

that's why we have a supplemental order before this Court, in

12

stead of the original order.

13
14

The Court of Appeals, in its second opinion, its
clarifying opinion, told the Board that "We feel under the --

15

that the Section 8(d) of the Act does not prohibit the Board

16

from entering an order to agree to a substantive contract pro™ -

vision; that the Board can either order agreemen ; directs

18

it can compel a concession be given in exchange ::o~ the de­

19

manded provision."

20
2.1

22
23
24
25

Q

°£

Now, where is the citation to the place where

the Board compelled by w<-<rd the other party to agree to a
specific provision of the contract.?
A

It is in the Supplemental Order issued by the

Board, Mr. Justice Black, on page 4 of Porter’s brief under the
"Statement of the Case."
6

1

Q

Is it in the appendix, also?

2

A

IT is in the appendix, also»

3

Q

Well, give us both citations; if you will»

4

A

Yes .

5

Q

What part of the appendix?

(5
7

I have it before

me; what page?
A

It's on Page 137 of the appendix, the

3

supplemental order is far at the lefhand side on page 136; "A

9

general bargaining order was first entered,” and then at the

10

top of the righthand page, 137, the order is:

"Grant to the

11

union a contract clause providing for check-off of union dues»

12

Q

That8s the place that you rely on?

13

A

Yes.

14

This case presents to this court for thefirst time

15

in the 35-year history of the National Labor Relations Act, a

16

situation in which the Board has ordered one party to agree to

17

a contract term.

13

specific intent of Congress, as expressed in the wording of

19

Section 8(d) of the Act, as well as the basic premise of free­

20

dom of contract, as contained and has been recognised to exist

21

in Section 8(d).

22

We submit thatthis order violates both the

This section of the act prpvides that the obligation

23

to bargain in good faith does not compel either party to agree

24

to a proposal or required the making of a concession.

25

And, of

course, this Court in both the American National Insurance case
7

1

and the Insurance Agent’s case, recognized Section 8{d) as

2

prohibitingthe Board from either directly or indirectly com­

3

pelling concessions or otherwise sitting in judgment on the

4

terms of the collective bargaining agreement.

5

It’s true that Section 10(c) of the Act, permits the

6

Board to enter such remedial orders, such affirmative orders,

7

as will effectuate the policies of the act.

8

9

We recognize the

distinction that the Court of Appeals and the Board and the
union are now arguing# that Section 8(d) itself, does not

10

directly relate, by express terms, to the scope of the remedy»

11

But it certainly expresses a fundamental policy of the act, that

12

of freedom of contract.

13

This Court, in the cases I cited a moment ago,

14

recognized that the intent of Congress and the legislative

15

history was well-cited by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Insurance

16

Agent's case.

17

But the intent of Congress was to keep the Board

from either directly or indirectly compelling agreement.

We

18

contend that the supplemental order is in clear derogation and

19

violation of this fundamental policy.

20

And, it’s interesting that the Board, until its

21

supplemental order took exactly the same position, the Board

22

did not enter, even though the union demanded it, or did not

23

24
25

enter a direct order to agree, initially.

And, in fact, when

we filed our petition for cert the first time in this Court the
Board took the position that the bargaining order did not
8

1

violata Section 8(d), that it merely ordered us to bargain in

2

good faith and they pointed out specifically that they had not

3

violated Section 8(d).

4
S

Q

Where is that in the record?

A

Yes.

Do you have it

offhand?

6

WE cited it in our brief.

That would be

7

on page 15 of the Porter brief, Mr. Justice Stewart, right in

8

the center of the page.

9

for certiorari the first time, and the Board pointed out there

10

that the original order did not violate, the provisions of 8(d) a
If I may digress one moment, you will recall that

1?
12
13
14
15
16
17

we were arguing that the effect of the Court of Appeals8
opinion was to cause us to agree and the Board points out that
the original order did not violate Section 8(d)t that the
statutory duty to bargain does not require the making of a con­
fession.

The Board's order merely directs the company to bar­

gain in good faith.

18
19

A

I doubt if the briefs would be in the appendix,

Q

No, no, I mean wouldn't that order of the Board

be in the appendix?
A

24
25

You don'f know where that is in the appendix,

Your Honor.

22
23

Q
do you?

20
21

And this is in answer to'our petition

The original order of the Board is in the

appendix.

9

1

Q

That’s what 1' (man.

2

A

The ox'iginal ruder is on page 55.

3

Q

So, it would be somewhere in there?

4

Q

Of the apperSix?

5

A

Well, they t clop ted the recommended order, so

6

I should refer you to page 12 for the examiner’s recommended

7

order, the Board merely having adopted that, and the recommended

0

order was a negative and affirmative ’’cease and desist from

refusing to bargain in gooi faith and affirmatively bargain."
And, of course, I point out that the Board’s regional
director, subsequent to this original bargaining order, found
that the company had bargained.

This is when the company came

to the union and said, "We are ready to bargain now over a
dues collection system," and the union took the position: "No,
you are required merely to agree now."
And then when the union asked the Board to initiate
contempt the union

pardon me, the Board advised the parties

by letter that thr. company had complied with both the negative
and the affirmative requirements of that original order and that
the case was hereby closed.
Now, I point this out very frankly it has nothing to
do with the issue now before this Court, except that the union
and the Board in the brief, argue appropriateness.

They say very

little, I suggest, about the statutory power, or what we contend
to be the lack of statutory power, but they do argue
10
I

1

ai3PS©jsH?-iMi@^ess, even though they contend we haven’t raised the

2

issue»

3

Well, I submit to you that a general bargaining order

4

must, be appropriate in the very case in which the Board found

5

that it effectuated' the desired result? that is? it got -the

6

employer to bargain.

7

Q .

As I read the Government's brief, and its.

8

question presented, it agrees with, you that the issue is

9

whether it has power to compel the making of that agreement?

10

A

Yes, that is the issue, Mr. Justice Black.

U

Q

And is there any denial of it in any other-

12

part of the Government0s brief?
A

13
14

That that is the issue, we are all in agree­

ment.
Q

15

All are agreed that the question is whether*

16

under the law, the Board, under any circumstances, has the

17

power to compel a company to agree to a specific term of the

18

contract?

19
2,0
21

A

.

r think we are all in. agreement that' that Is

the specific issue.
I would like to call the Court's attention, if I may,

22

to the approach used by the Court of Appeals.

23

Appeals, very properly recognized that freedom of contract is a

24

fundamental policy and premise of the act and they agreed that

25

remedies which impinge on it are not to be lightly undertaken.

11

The Court of

1

But they then, pointed out that under Section 10(c) the Board is

2

to balance the policies and to try to move forward under all

3

policies.
They then cited what they considered to be an equal

4
5

policy and that is a policy of the act. to equalise

6

gaining power of employees and employers„ by assuring the right

7

of workers to bargain collectively,,

8

It

■■ -

the bar­

The Court of Appeals then proceeded to state such

alleged facts as the fact that the dues checkoff provision is
in 92 pefcent of industry contracts? that dues checkoff is
likely to be of life or death import to a fledgling union; that
dues checkoff provisions and ordering of it is only a minor

13

intrusion on freedom of contract.

14

the union’s nearest office is 85 miles away and that the

15
18

17
13

They even cited the fact that

employees were scattered over a wide area.
The book concluded that the collection of dues with­
out a dues checkoff provision had presented the union with a
substantial problem of communication and transportation.

We

19

submit that this approach, although laudatory in the balancing

20

of the policies, but this approach of looking at the need of

through the record.

And, of course, it has been cited all

At the original hearing, the company a aid,

"We’re not objecting as a matter of inconvenience," and so
forth, "cost."
12

I submit that this is exactly what S'(d) prohibits,

1
2

and that this Court has recognised that &(d) , that Congress

3

prohibited the Board from balancing the needs, from sitting in

4

judgment on whether one party should have had the provision- and

5

the other party didn't have a good enough reason for denying it,.
In fact, I alsf suggest that this area of whether a

business reason is needed for refusing- a contract demand by the

8

other bargaining party is part of the issue of this case*

Well, Mr» Winson, I gather that the Board

found here that Porter had taken a bad faith, or otherwise
impermissible bargaining position? is that right? or did so
find?
A
Q

Yes, Mr» Justice Brennan»
And 1 understand the Board's argument to be

that 8(d) doesn81 permit a party to choose to agree to a pro­
posal for a reason that would violate the statute»

Do you take

a different position?
A
Q

Yas, I do, Your Honor»
That is, you take the position that 8(d) pro-

tects you without regard to good or bad faith?
A

I think it has to, Mr, Justice Brennan, for the

very reason that everybody9s in agreement that 8(d) prohibits
the Board from using a refusal to agree as evidence of bad faith,
Well, to me it seems illogical to say this and at the same time
say that once bad faith is found on the basis of other evidence,
13

1

and this is all subjective intent,, that then the Board can

2

order agreement on the very same contract —
Q

3

Is there anything in the legislative history

4

of 8(d) which indicates that Congress dealt with its applica­

5

tion in the context of a finding of bad faith?

intent of Congress is clear and everybody agrees with it.

13

our problem now; on the scope of the remedy.

It's

And, of course, to us the evil to be cured — the

14

evil that Congress is after here, is to keep the Board from

IS

intruding into the collective bargaining process? well, to

17

prohibit the use of a refusal to agree as evidence, but then at

18

the same time, for Congress to permit it on the order to agree

19

to that very same contract provision, just doesn't make sense,

20

it seems to us.
With the legislative history and as this Court has

21

22

recognised the intent of Congress is too broad for that, we

23

submit.

24

the Board was prohibited from directly or indirectly, sitting ir

25

It’s too much, for example, for this Court to say that

judgment, for example.
14

1

Mow# what the Court of Appeals —

2

Q

Of course, Insurance Agents5 didn81 involve a

3

situation like this , where there is a finding of bad faith on

4

the part of the employer.

That, actually, was the conduct of

Yes, and that was a case of regulating the

economic weapons.
I would submit, Mr. Justice Brennan, that there is a
closer analogy of the Insurance Agents' case to this one in
merely the wording in your opinion, which of course, we rely
heavily upon.
And I cite, I must give credit for the Chief Justice
for my argument on this point, but he dissented; the Chief
Justice dissented in the Roanoke Iron case in the District of
Columbia Circuit, which happened, by coincidence to be a dues
checkoff case, also.

And, the Chief Justice pointed out there

the grant or refusal, the presence or absence of a dues checkoff
provision is, in effect, an economic weapon in the sense that
the union without a dues checkoff provision is, there is no
doubt in many cases, they are under economic pressure.

But, as

the Chief Justice pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the
Roanoke case, an employer, with his employees on strike, is
harmed even more.

Also, we're talk

Also, we're talking, in effect, I think, about a
bargaining tool; a bargaining tactic.
15

Granted, Porter did not

1

say to the union in this cases

2

to agree to a dues checkoff because we want to trade it next

3

year»

4

obviously, the more the employer is going to resist to the

5

point of getting something in return,.

But the more a union would demand a provision like this,

What do

Well, that was an instance, wasn't it, of

conduct on the part of an employer which was a violation of
the statute, but I don't believe there was an order — I don't
believe there was an order that went beyond a restoration-type
remedy, did it, did it?
A

No? it didn’t, Your Honor.

And the union and the Board, of course, cite status

you have in mind, specifically, Mr. Justice Brennan?

9

"We are withholding or refusing

quo cases.

This case, I don81 think, is worth arguing beyond

our brief.

This case certainly goes beyond -the restoration of

status quo.
Q

Well, may 1 ask you, Mr. Winson, do you,—

perhaps I’m only repeating the question I asked you earlier •—
■I gather your position is that in the application of 8(d) it’s
immaterial whether the employer's conduct was in good or bad
i. ‘
faith?
16

A

1

Welly no, Mr. Justice Brennan, for the reason

2

that the bead faith has to be there or we wouldn't be to the

3

point of a remedy in a bargaining case.
In other1 words, in an 3(a)(5) case, except for a

4
5

mere refusal, but even that of course, is bad faith — but what

6

X:,m saying is that where the parties have bargained or have sat

7

down and then there is a finding of an 8(a)(5) violation, then

8

that has to be premised, of course, on bad faith.
So, we're now at the point of a remedy.

9
10
11

12
13

14
15

union and the Board to argue here that there is a line that can
be drawn by this Court, we submit, is just not practical.

To

ON BEHALF OF CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE

7

MR, COHEN;

Mr, Cohen,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

I“m appearing here today on behalf of the Chamber of

Commerce of the United States, because we, in agreement with

10

Mr,

11

of labor relations.

12

Winson, believe that this is a landmark case in the field

Q

issue has never been presented to the Court before?
A

No, I said, neither the Board nor the Court or

even commentator, has suggested up to this case, that the Board
has the power to dictate and tell the parties to a collective
bargaining negotiation: "These are the terms you must agree to,"

A

That is the point.

Cur point is it has never

been done because it has been presumed that the Board -- this
is the kind of a decision that the Board should not be required
to make, and should nor be made by virtue of Section 8(d),
Section 8(d) is not a limitation only on the Board's
finding of good faith.

It. affects all of the policies of the

act, as I think this Court indicated in the Fansteel case.
The Board seeks inthis case, also to invoke this

25

24

1

remedy»- notwithstanding that it has decided that the remedy

2

wasn't required here and in fact, decided that the contempt

3

powerof the Courts of Appeals, which is the traditional means

4
5

of obtaining compliance with Board orders, should not be
utilised in this-

6

case»

lfces difficult to understand, therefore, how this

7

case can be viewed by the Respondents as one of only minor

0

significance.

9

If the Board has the power in this case, then

it has the power in any case whenver it concludes that a party,

10

either a company or a union, did not articulate a sufficient

1?

justification for — or a sufficient business reason or a union

12

reason, for refusing to accept a proposal, that it can then

13

compel acceptance of that proposal and regulate the results of

14

collective bargaining.

Q

Well* I gather anyway* Mr»Cohen*

really*

isn’t your position that no matter how intransigent an. employer
may he* all that can happen is that an order to bargain collec­
tively may be met.

And if he — well* some order of that kind.

10

But no remedy in any ©vent* which goes so far as to require the
employer to execute a particular provision or a particular agree

A

That is correct.

Q

And that if there

13

are* that if an employer

14

simply is the kind that Mr. Justice Black suggests* and then
15

you get what orders you can get and if he persists in his in­
16

transigence* then you have to go to contempt or some other way
17

of reaching it? isn’t that it?
18

A

I suggest that the Board has not only a general

19

bargaining power in its remedial arsenal.

It has numerous ways?

20
it has a lot of ingenuity in devising appropriate remedies.

If

21

those remedies fail for some reason* then there is a contempt
power of the Court of Appeals.

For example* the Court of

Appeals here in viewing this case on contempt* without looking at
the narrow question;

the Board has to devise some kind of weapon here.

The closest that this Court has had has been a

case like Heinz, for example, very early in the day where an
employer agreed to a contract and refused to put it into writing.
In that, situation the Board ordered him to execute the contract
and this Court sustained that remedy.

Q

But, you didnet order this remedy.

A

The Board thought that the stereotype refusal-

to-bargain remedy would cure the situation, but in the light of
the post decree negotiations the further enlightment that the
Court of Appeals gave the Board and after all, the Board and the
Courts of Appeals are partners in this business of trying to
work out a satis fe4Ctory administration of the act, were
appreciated that for this unusual type of situation something
more than the conventional order to bargain was required.
Now, this is a situation where on the Board's unfair

Now, here is a situation where after the first refusal to bar-

1961.

19

The Board found the company was refusing to bargain in good

faith and that order was enforced by the Fourth Circuit.

resumed negotiations in October of '63 and they had 21 meetings

would be so in they Roanoke case and I think 1 could assume

arguendo that perhaps it might be, but there was no suggestion

23

that there was anything like that here, because you had five

24

years ©f bargaining negotiations.

25

There was no suggestion at

all that the checkoff was being used as a trading device?

32

!

certainly, in the course of five years of negotiations, where

2

you are bargaining back and forth the checkoff is going to be

3

used as a trading device, that would have appeared.
The company negotiator, frankly conceded at the

4
5

Board hearing that his only reason for not giving the checkoff

6

was that the company was not going to aid and comfort the union

7

at this location,
I submit that in the. context of this case it is an

8
9

illegitimate reason that is antithetical to the basic tenets

10

of bargaining in good faith, because if you have to recognise

11

the union as the collective bargaining representative as this

12

employer did, and bargain in good faith with a fM toward

13

entering into a contract, anything that you give in a contract

'14

15

is going to give aid and- comfort to the union,

tod this

employer was making that the touchstone.
In the context of this case it indicated it beyond

16

17

that, that really the reason he wasn't giving it was that —-

18

it was just because the union was asking for it, because he had

19

agreed to checkoff for other purposes; he agreed that there was

20

no greater inconvenience in doing it for union dues,

2,1

indeed, he further conceded that at other plants they did check

22

off union dues,

May I say that as I understand your, adversary3 s

12

argument, they think that good faith has nothing to do with it;

13

that the law just does not justify the Board in commanding that

14

a particular provision be put in the contracts isn't that right?

15

A

That is correct, Your Honor, and I —

16

Q

How, suppose Congress had passed a law .provid­

17

ing for checkoffs, can you think of any constitutional objection

18

to that?

19

A

Ho, 1 cannot,

1 think that the short answer t©

20

their argument, 1 think is the one that Justice Brennan suggested,

21

in which 1 intend to com© to in a moment? namely that 8(d) has

22

to b® read in the light of 10(c) and the legislative history of

23

8Cd) so far as I have been able t© ascertain, and I have studied

24

it rather carefully, shows no indication that Congress war eon™

25

cerned with the problem of a remedy once you had
34

established

1

that the refusal to bargain was in bad faith.

2

of 8(d) is that the Board in determining whether there has been

3

a refusal to bargain in good or bad faith, should not regard as

4

decisive, or determinative, in determining bad faith, whether

S

or not the employer did or did not or the union did or did not,

6

agree to certain substantive proposals, as to whether they were

7

reasonable or unreasonable.
Q

8

9

The main thrust

Well, assuming the breadth that you argue for

in 10(c) as to that extent, at least, some quail location on the

10

prohibition of 8(d), where do you draw the line in this?

What's

n

the point at which you say, “Yes, 10(c) goes- so far that we can

12

ignore 8(d) in this case."

What5s the standard by which

13

it is to be decided, when you may and when you may not ignore

14

8 (d) ?

15
16
17
18

A

Well, I think that the keys to the ~ that the

nature of the violation affords the standard.

Where you have a

situation like you have here, where the employer does not only
bargain in bad faith, but he has indicated that he has no

19

legitimate reason for withholding agreement, other than this bad

20

faith reason.

21

22
23
24

25

And the nature of the proposal is one like a

checkoff, where, as you pointed out, it's a pretty cut and dried
proposition.

I mean that it is unlike wages in the sense that

it is most unlikely that there can be any economic or business
consideration that would qualify the amount of the Ihcreases
Certainly, in that kind of a case, namely the checkoff
35

3

situation, it is not doing violence to the policy of 8(d) to

2

say that the Board, under 10(c) can provide this kind of a

3

remedy, because otherwise —

4

Q

I'd like to ask you one other question, then.

5

A

Yes, sir»

6

Q

Because it seems to me like most of this is

7

around what you mean by bad faith, and what that means®

8

you mean that bad faith, that they have just decided that they

9

are not going to make any agreement and they are offering these

30

Do

as excuses to keep from doing so?

31

A

I think so.

I think that, they have used their

12

refusal to agree to a checkoff as a cloak for not agreeing to

13

any contract with the union at all.

34

Q

You. say they are going through a form of

15

collective bargaining, and agreeing to bargain, but in reality

16

they won't bargain.

17

A

That is correct.

18

Q

Now, what is the remedy if this is not the

19

remedy?

20

I don't &anfc to do this.”

Q

Well, I, frankly, as I understand your answer

to Mr. Justice Black°s question would mean that the Board could
impose this remedy in any 8(d)(5) violation,

Whenever there is

a finding of a lack of good faith bargaining, it seems to me
then the Board

would have the power to impose this remedy.

And I think that has to be your argument.
A

I respectfully disagree, Your Honor.

Q

Well, if it isn't that broad, Mr. Come, what

about arbitration courses?

!

I don't think things have changed

much since I was in practice, and employers views about arbitra­
tion clauses were much as you describe what you say was the
position taken here by the spokesman for the company as to a
checkoff clause.

Can you conceive that the Board, there would
37

be circumstances under which the Board could compel ar

employer to sign an arbitrario» provision?

Ho. I think that aid and comfort in this case

14

has to be read inthe light of all of the facts that I have

laid out which shows that this isn’t an employer who has turned

16

down the checkoff either because he doesn't want to get into the

38

Are you suggesting that

it's the obligation of either the union or the employer always

2

to reveal all the reasons why they do or do not agree?

3

A

Well, I think that at some point those reasons

4

should come out if you are going to have good faith bargaining.

5

As this Court pointed out in the Truitt case ~

6

Q

In which case?

7

A

In the Truitt case which Your Honor wrote.

3

That involved the problem as to whether or not an employer

who claimed inability to pay had to substantiate his claim at

10

some point by bringing forth his records.

11

made in bargaining, if they are in good faith, have to be honest

I think that claims

3

12

claims, and at some point the cards have to be laid on the

13

table, and certainly after six years of negotiations that we

14

had here, if the company's real motive was to hold off the

15

checkoff for trading purposes, that should have come out.

I thought it was the essence of negotiations

that a negotiator was entitled to keep his cards covered.

FURTHER ARGUMENT BY NORTON J. COME , ASSISTANT

4

GENERAL COUNSEL, NLRB

5

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

To pursue something that

6

Justice Brennan opened up, the reciprocity or two-way aspect

7

of this kind of a remedy.

8
9

Suppose, for example, an employer made a demand for
a provision in the union contract that the bargaining team be

to

made up of such officers as the union would designate, but that

11

it would always include three members of the work force of a

12

particular unit? and that he then asserted that this was be-

13

cause he wanted to encourage union democracy and develop a

14

sense of responsibility, improve the leadership of the union,

15

et ceterai and the union says, "No, we811 do this our own way."

16

The Business Agent says, "I don't want any spies in here."

17

they founder on that demand and have a complete impasse and get

18

to just about where we are here.

/

19
£0
21

And

Bo you think the Board could order the union to agree
to that provision, under any circumstances?
A

I don't think so, Your Honor, because I don't

£2

think you would have an unfair labor practice there, to begin

23

with, for two reasons;

£4

composition of the union bargaining team and there would not be

25

a mandatory subject for collective bargaining.

Well, I don't know that it is that recent, but

in any event, most people in the field would readily agree that

12

that is within the area of wages, hours and other conditions,

13

terms and conditions of employment.

14

union bargaining team is, at best, a permissive subject of

15

collective bargaining, like the strike ballot clause, or who

16

signs the agreement-type of thing that the Court had in Borg-

17

Warner.

18

sort of stuff, although parties may be able to propose, they

19

cannot insist on impasse.

But the composition of the

And the Court indicated there that with respect to that

Secondly, even if it were within the area of manda­

20
21

tory bargaining, on the set of facts that you give me, it seems

22

to me that the union has a valid justification for refusing to

enlarge the bargaining team.

j

Q

Now,

But it would certainly be consistent with the

apixit of the Labor Act and Landrum-Griffin and a great many
41

1

things to improve anion democracy this way? wouldn't it?

2

A

We Ilf that may well foe* Your Honor*, but as yet

3

the statute only requires bargaining about wages# hours and

4

other terms and conditions of employment.

5

mandatory bargaining.

6

Q

That's the area of

Well# then# you pick one that would be within

7

the orbit, of mandatory bargaining.

8

any circumstances that the Board could ever order the union to

9

agree to?

10

A

Can you suggest one under

Well# I haven't thought about it# Your Honor.

ii

I thinkthat the essential predicate# though# that

to the

12

order in this case# and that I find lacking in the hypothetical

13

cases that I've been getting# is that in this case# there was a

14

threshold finding by the Board that the refusal to grant'the

15

checkoff was in bad faith and that the sole purpose for refusing

16

to grant it was to frustrate an agreement with the union.

17

As Justice Black said# the company went through the

18

motions of bargaining, but it really didn't want agreement and

19

it was holding off on the checkoff because that was the way of

20

carrying out its scheme of frustrating an agreement.

21

Furthermore# you have a

which shows that not

22

only V7as this employer's reason, but he had no other conceivable

23

reason for opposing the checkoff.

24

to bargain in good faith over the checkoff, based upon this kind

25

of evidence.

So# that you have a refusal
i

42

1

And the limited question in this case is not whether

2

the Board has power to compel concessions under other circum­

3

stances, but whether, given this particular unfair labor prac­

4

tice finding,, that is grounded, as I have indicated, the Board

5

has a remedy for the — for that kind of refusal to bargain,

6

court order for checkoff.

7

And we submit, that if you get this kind of a unique

8

situation, a checkoff — an order to draft a checkoff is really

9

the only frank thing to do, because an order to bargain in

10

good faith suggests that there is something left that you could

1?

bargain about.
Xnthe situation that I have presented, the employer

f2

13

has so painted himself into the corner that there is nothing to

14

talk about.

15

as the Court of Appeals pointed out when he goes back he can't

16

give the same reasons that he gave before for refusing a check­

17

off, and to permit him at this point to manufacture new reasons

18

that he admitted before were not a factor, would make a mockery

>9

Talk would only make for additional delay, because

of the collective bargaining process.
So, what we3re left with, then is whether or not

20
21

8{d) in this particular situation that I'm talking about would

22

preclude the Board from using its 10(c) powers which would

23

otherwise be broad enough to permit this kind of a remedy,would

24

absolutely bar the Board in this situation from ordering a

25

checkoff.
43

We submit that it does not, for the reasons that the

1
2

legislative history of 8(b) shows that what Congress was con™

3

cerned about there was the Board making the initial finding of

4

bad faith based upon the failureef the employer to concede to

S

& union proposal because of the Board’s judgment that since it

8

was a reasonable proposal, it was unreasonable, and therefore,

7
.

bad faith for him to refuse to agree»
That is not —

May I ask you about that legislative-history?

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

11

12
13
14

15
16

but is there anything that you have seen anywhere that indicates
that any of the Senators or Congressmen had in rfiind that the
Board could do this, or is it more in line with following the
ideas of Railroad Labor Act which, when you reach the end, you
have still got to strike or lock-out.
Now, what did you find in the legislative history to

to what should be done if they want to force; it by governmental
action.

What do you find to indicates that there was «any desire

on anybody’s part to force it by governmental action?
A

Well, I thinkthat the legislative history was

silent on the question of what kind of remedy the Board imposed
once it found an unfair labor practice.

The history is directed

tothe elements that go into finding a refusal to bargain in good
44

1

faith or bad faith, to begin with.

And there the history indi­

That's as far as the history

And as I showed you earlier, the Board’s bad faith
finding here is not based on any such consideration.
Q

Well, Mr. Come, sure'y the vary basic premise

of our whole labor relations structure is that we're regulated

10

to see that the parties sit down at the bargaining table and

11

come out with agreements that they agree upon and that govern­

12

ment shall not force agreements upon them.

13

essential of our whole structure! isn’t it?

That’s the very

14

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

15

Q

Mow, doesn't *— whether under the guise of

16

remedy or anything else, isn't that rather to assert such a

17

power is rather in conflict with that basic premise? isn't it?

18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

A

Well, I think there are two answers to that.

In the first place this Court recognized this in Insurance
Agents8 and —-

that even in finding whether or not there has

been an initial-refusal to bargain in good faith, there is a
tension between the freedom of contract and the duty to bargain
in good faith. As Judge Magruder put it in Prince, "You can't
be blinded wholly to the reasonableness of the proposal."
But, beyond that, once you have found on the basis of ample
45

evidence that has nothing to do with the reasonableness of the
2

proposal, that the employer has bargained in bad faith, you

3

have to balance the freedom of contract policy of 8(d) against

4

other policies of the act*

5

faith toward an agreement is a policy»

8

remedies for refusals to bargain that are meaningful in the

7

particular context and when you balance those policies against

3

the freedom-of-contract policy in a similar situation that we

9

have here, we submit that on balance the Board could reasonably

Providing effective

conclude that the policy of 10(c) dominates»

10

Q

11

Mr» Come, is there any finding her© that the

purpose of the employer here was to weaken the union by

12

13

The policy of bargaining in good

not agreeing to the checkoff provision?
-

14

A

The —

15

Q

1 didn't see any, but —

18

A

The finding of the Board was most clearly

17

rearticulated in its supplemental decision on page 135 where it

18

says that "The Respondent has repeatedly violated Section 8

19

8(a)(5) and admittedly has no business, for opposing the check­

20

off end as its only reason for such opposition was to frustrate

21

agreement with the union."
Q

22
23
24
23

1 know, but thafc*s not the question I'm putting

to you.
The question I'm putting to you is whether there was
a finding that the affirmative reason, the real reason for this
46

i

1

was to weaken the position of the union.

2

question is going to be:

3

ent case if there had been such a finding?

4

A

And then my next

Do you think you would have a differ­

Well, I don't think that the Board specifically

5

found that the purpose was to weaken the union.

I think that

6

that is implicit in the finding that the sole purpose and only

7

purpose was to frustrate an agreement, because that is the

8

necessary consequence of refusing to agree in bad faith over a

9

period of five years, and I think that the history of why

10

8(a)(5} was put into the act, shows that Congress recognized

11

that that was so.

12

to bargain in good faith because it was recognized by Senator

13

Wagner and ethers that a mere obligation to recognize doesn’t

14

mea*. anything unless there is an obligation to bargain in good

15
16
17
18
!9
20
2?
22
23

24
25

That they put in an affirmative obligation

faith with a view to arriving at an agreement, because if you
don't do that in good faith and try to come to <y.n agreement
that is necessari3.y going to wear down the union and weaken it.
That, I think —
Q

Well, going back to the question the Chief

Justice asked you a little earlier in the argument here; how
does this frustrate the agreement.

The union can have an agree­

ment if it is willing to forget about the checkoff clause.
A

That is quite true.

However, the union is

entitled to hold out for a checkoff so long as the employer is
in bad faith, refusing to give up on the checkoff.
47

Here the

1

employer, he’s not refusing a checkoff for a valid reason,

a

which he could do and if the union refused to give up on the

3

checkoff, that would be a frustrating of the agreement that

4

would not be a violation of the statute, but where the refusal

5

to get an agreement is due to the employer's bad faith refusal

6

to give you the checkoff, then it is a refusal to bargain in

7

good faith, because what the employer is doing there is he

8

is using the refusal to give you the checkoff, really as a sham

9

for not dealing with this union at all, and that is what the

10
11

nub of this case is»
Q

I happen to know a man in Alabama who is a

12

big employer,

13

ject; he didn't like unions; he didn't like to deal with them

14

and he would rather surrender almost his business than to deal

15

with unions.

16

I have no doubt on earth about why he would, ob­

Now, 1 have never thought that the Board would have

17

the power to make him deal with them that way, to certain terms.

18

They could make him bargain and negotiate, but I had never

19

thought of that act as being anything more than one which, like

20

the Labor Relations, led them on as far as you could lead them

21

and when they got at dagger's point, let them fight it out,

22

A

Well, I think --

23

Q

Let's assume that you could put the president

24

25

of this company in jail for civil contempt for an indefinite
period untilhe bargained, if the findings that you all seem to
48

1

agree upon, are correct.

2

A

That's bad faith.

That's why we feel that it's a much snore forth-■

3

right thing for the Board to specifically tell the company in

4

its order what it is that is needed to demonstrate his good

5

faith, and that's why the order here was made specifically.
Now, to come back to your example, Mr. Justice

6
7

Black —
Q

8
9

They didn't say that that man testified at

these hearings?

10

A

What's that?

11

Q

I may say that that man testified at these

12

hearings for the act, and he testified against it.

13

see how logically you are right.

14

the end where the government is going to force an agreement, not

15
16

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

If we wanted to carry it to

which would keep them from striking, which wouldn't keep them
from having a lock-out.
I agree, and as Justice Douglas asked you: You could

17
18

Now, I don't

try him for contempt; you put him in jail for contempt and he
has his word: "I don't want to deal with unions," and you say,
"Well, that's not it; you just don't want to make any contract
at all."

And you get that, finally, on a bad basis, to prose­

cute a man criminally.

But I cannot see why, accepting what

you say, because it seems to me here if I had to decide it off­
hand, and having had that experience with men who thought that
way, I would say he's just dilly-dallying around; it's a sham;
49

i

it’s a sham.
Well? that's a pretty thin ground on which to send

2
3

a man jail for contempt; isn't it?

4

finally come to.
A

5

And that's what it would

Well? I thinkthat if you have to distinguish a

6

hard bargaining case from a case that — such as we have here?

7

I mean there is no question that? as an original proposition?

8

an employer doesn’t have to agree to proposals just because the

9

union is making them.

I mean, there is plenty of room for good

10

faith? collective bargaining? even though that means that you

11

end up at loggerheads and the union has the option of either

12

striking or the employer or locking up.

13

This is an employer —

That is not this case.

14

Q

Why isn't it?

15

A

Well? on the findings of the Board that were

16
17

affirmed by the Court of Appeals? this is the case of an
employer who is going into bargaining
Q

18

He pretended to object on one ground? when in

18

reality? he was objecting online other.

20

you would have to submit to a jury in a contempt case.
A

21

22
23
24
25

That's the question

But? by making the requirement specific you

avoid a contempt action because the employer knows what he is
asking —
Q

I agree? but Congress hasn't yet said it wanted

to go that far? I'm afraid? in connection with the duties it
50

i

1

puts on the union by the workers and the government.
A

Who do you represent?

A

United Steelworkers of America.

We're the

charging party before the National Labor Relations Board, Your
Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE:

Counsel, if you run into pressure

we will take that into account.
MR. COHEN:

The company and the Chamber are here

today, not to challenge any of the findings of fact made by the
National Labor Relations Board; not to question the fact that
they were motivated by bad faith and refused to enter into a
collective bargaining, and not to question whether or not in this
this particular case, if the Board had the power to compel a
concession, '.this case was a proper exercise of that power.
The company and the Chamber are here on the bal'dfaced legal proposition that irrespective of bad faith, irrespec­
tive of their recidivism, irrespective of all of these things,
52

I

1

the simple fact remains the Board lacks the power to compel

2

them tc exact a concession of the kind that was exacted in this

3

case.
Wow,, in support of that legal position the company

and the Chamber have relied —

"Exacted a concession;" is that accurate?

or else."

statutory language of "makinq a concession."

In the company’s

view this was making them concede to something by having to
....
...
,
execute it to the contrary.
Q

The very word "concession" implies agreement,

however reluctant.
A

It required an agreement of this nature.

I

don’t think there is any question about that.
Now, in support of this proposition the company
relies on -— looks to the statutory language of 8(d) and the
legislative history of 8{d).

Now, we submit, and we have dealt

with this at length in our brief, that 8(d) was set up and
established to define more clearly what the statutory obligation
to confer in good faith meant and the whole thrust of 8(d) is
53

1

2
3

conferring in good faith.
It is true that to the extent that Congress recog™

nized that the employer who is bargaining in good faith, is

4

entitled to the freedom of contract principles.

5

who is bargaining in good faith,- cannot be compelled to make a

S

concession and cannot be required to make an agreement.

is the express statutory language.

table, and say well, this union's demand' looks fairly reason­
able and therefore, when the company responded negatively that's
the indicia of bad faith.

That's the practice that Congress was

addressing itself.
That is not the situation we have here.

There's no

argument being made by the Chamber or the company that the
Board's finding of fact, namely; that the company's position
with respect to dues checkoff was taken for the sole purpose
of frustrating agreement; transgress 8(d).

The company isn't

arguing that the basic finding or the statutory violation here
in any x^ay was precluded by 8{d).

54

On the contrary, the company

in effect, is saying:

I will be delighted, briefly to do so here, but it seems to me
that what we are saying here is that we have a serious question
whether or not a bad faith employer or a bad faith employee has
any right at all to rely on the statutory language of 8(d).

We

acknowledge, however, that notwithstanding this foreclosure,
that there still is, running through the Labor Act, a basic
policy of freedom of contract.
But, of course, as this Court said in the Machinist's
Local versus NLRB, "When you look at the Act there is only one

question of whether under that circumstance the Board can assert
this power.
A

19
20

I think I would respond by saying, when you

say, "but to leave the substantive terms to the parties," this
is only on the assumption that we have people who are in good
faith, trying to arrive at a collective bargaining agreement.
This is -- and this was what was recognised by the Court below
when they said, "We recognise there is here a minor intrusion
into the freedom of contract."

17
18

If that is, essentially, the

basis behind the legislation and then that does raise the

11

But it is arguable that the course of the basic

Q
I think.

Even if the employer were —

Well, I was going a little beyond that, really,

What I was trying to suggest was that Congress, after

deliberation decided that government was not going to write
labor contracts? and it wasn’t going to allow any agency of

2?

government to prescribe the terms of the labor agreements.

22

if that’s so, then I would suppose, unless you have a powerful

23
24
25

argument, that the Board can’t assert that power.
A

Well, that language, I believe, that whole

section of the legislative history which you have so ably
56

Mow,

1

referred to in Insurance Agents8, that all, I repeat, pre­

2

supposes a good faith bargaining custom.

3

Now, there is nothing inthe legislative history

4

when we transpose it to look at 10(c).

The Board is empowered

5

withthe board authority to effectuate the policies of the Act.

6

Nov?, when Mr. Justice Black, in an early time in the hearing,

7

raised the question of was there anything in the legislative

0

history that points to giving the Board this power?

9

the answer is twofold:

I think

Obviously 8 {d) didn't address itself to

10

this problem, because 8(d) presupposes good faith bargaining,

11

but in 10(c) numerous Congressmen got up and said, "Now, what

12

kinds of problems are going to be confronted to the Labor Board,

13

and how can we delineate what their authority should be in

14

remedying those problems?"

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

And the Congress came to the con­

clusion, and this Court has referred to the statute in many of
their decisions:

Seven-Up Bottling, Phelps Dodge; there's an

enormous amalgam of potential problems, variables, depending on
the facts of every case.

"What we cure going to do is empower

the Board to issue .diafc affirmative action it believes will
effectuate the policies of the Act?' Obviously, that is not
unreviewable, unlimited discretion, but it is a basic discretion
and indirectly, I would submit to you, it addresses itself to
the type of problem that you are speaking about.
I would say indirectly in 10(c) there is always the
possibility that the Board could issue an order of the sort that

agreement with this union?
