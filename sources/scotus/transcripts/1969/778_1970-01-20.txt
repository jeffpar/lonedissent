ARGUMENT OF RENA K. UVILLER

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

3

MRS. UVILLER:

Wo. 778 in the matter of

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the first clear opportunity for the
Court to determine one of the implications of the landmark case

10

inre Gault.

11

this Court sought, but was unable to proceed most recently in

12

the case of DeBaker vs. Brainard an opportunity to determine

13

whether a juvenile may be found guilty of a law violation and

14

confined for a number of years unless proved beyond a reasonable

15

doubt, that is, on proof less than that customarily considered

16

the highest level of proof in criminal proceedings.

17

It affords on a good record an opportunity which

In this case the 12-year-old appellant was found guilt

i-o?.

3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

18

of an act of larceny in violation of the New York penal law,

19

and while he could, have been confined for a maximum of five year?;

20

had he been an adult, he faced a maximum confinement of six

21

years because he was tried in the New York Family Court.

22
23
24
25

The determination that he was guilty of this act of
!
larceny was based expressly on the provision of the New York
statute which provides for such a finding by a mere preponderance
of the evidence.

2

1

The issue arose briefly in the following context»

The

2

juvenile was tried in a fact-finding hearing in the Family Court

3

and at that hearing the complainant,, a saleslady, testified that

4

one night she was at work and while the store was open for busi­

5

ness, she and her co-workers did not believe any other people

6

were in the premises, that there were no customers present.

7

However, she became alerted at some point that a

8

lavatory door in the back of the premises was locked and a moment:

9

or two later the door opened and a young boy scooted out the

10

II

store and out into the street.
The lady testified that she had at the most ten seconds

12

to observe him in pi'ofile as he darted by, and she saw him from

13

a distance of about 20 feet.

14
13
16
17

Q

She then proceeded into the ——
", .

I

If you see someone that you have known before,
i

isn't one second sometimes enough?
.

A

Yes, Your Honor, but in this case it really

emerged that she knew this boy previously.

Hot at that time,

.

18
19

20
2!

22
23
24
25

but when she was confronted by him in a one-to-one confrontation;
.

the next night in the police station.

There is nothing in this

record which indicates -—
Q

What difference does it make which time she drew

those conclusions?
A

Well, it is unclear from this record and I would

suggest that the Family Court judge, in finding the boy guilty,
conceded that there was reasonable doubt in this case about —

3

.

I

I don't know —• it is unclear what the doubt was about, that the

z

lady had an opportunity to see him or when she made the determi­

3

nation that this was someone she had known previously»

4
5

6

Q

What did she say about having known, him pre­

h

She said

viously?
after she saw the boy scoot out, she

7

'
called the police officer and she was then called to the police

8

station the next night where she saw the boy, and she testified

9

in court that she knew this boy very well, and. she said that she!

10

had seen him on many previous occasions when he had come to the

11

store and that she. had thrown him out, as a matter of fact.

12

The boy, of course, and his mother and his unci® all

13

testified that he was home, and could not possibly have been out

14

of the house that entire evening, and testified to an alibi.

15

He, of course, also denied that he ever knew this lady before.

16

J

But I would suggest that it would be inappropriate

17

here for us again consider what entered into the fact-finder's

18

mind when he was making this determination.

19

credibility of various witnesses and had before him the fact

20

that the lady did see him in an inherently suggestive situation

21

the next night, and determined that he did have a bit of a

He did assess the

!

22
23

doubt about this boy's guilt.
This is quite developed in the record and the judge

24

most candidly noted that he was applying a different, standard of

25

proof than would have applied in an adult situation, and that

4

1

therefore the finding was not as certain«

2

And I would submit that at this point what we are here

3

to consider is the appropriateness of the measure of proof that

4

the fact-finder applied as opposed to what went into his deter-

5

ruination that the child was guilty by the standard that he applied *

6

Q

It is not up to us here to say., "Well, we review

7

the evidence and we think we could have found beyond a reason­

8

able doubt that this young fellow stole the purse."

9

A

That is right, Mr, Justice Steward»

50

Q

Do you know of any case in this Court where the

11

I

Court has said (inaudible)
A

12

Mr» Justice Harlan, there is no express holding
I

13

to that affect, but I would suggest, that the reason that is so

14

is that this is so widespread a standard, it has such fundamen­

15

tal antecedents that holdings to that effect have never been

16

necessary,

17

Q

Is it a standard in the 50 states?

18

A

Yes, it is,

19

I would like to say at the outset that to seek a

1
.

20
21

22
23
24
25

denomination of the proceeding here involved as civil or criminal
would be futile and would merely only obscure the question that
we have to deal with, because it is our basic contention that
whatever we call these proceedings, juvenile proceedings, to find
a child guilty of law violation and to incarcerate him for a
substantial period of time, unless circumstance prove which are j
5

Ii

1

known to our law, is a violation of due process.
And it is a violation of due process. I would submit,

2
3

however that concept may be defined.

Whether it is, as in Mr.

4

Justice Black's view, the law of the land where an adult is

5

accused of a crime and confined or whether xt is considered the

6

fundamental fairness of the proceedings.

7

been said by this Court and other courts about the fairness of

8

this standard where liberty is at stake for law violation, I

9

would just like to reiterate a couple of considerations,

And although much has

And

10

that is, the standard after all expresses an attempt to reduce

II

the chance of risk that an innocent person is going to be con-

12

victed.

13

It is a flat, as it were, the fact-finder that he must

14

be very, very certain that this is the person that did the act

15

and, in fact, as this Court noted in Kaufman against the United

16

States many years ago, it is really a. fact corollary to the

17

presumption of innocence, and I would doubt that anyone would

18

suggest that that is a most fundamental presumption, should not

19

attach to somebody accused merely because of his age.

20

And of course the reason -—

21

Q

22

of his age?

23

a system of juvenile courts was set up to take people under a

24

different age out of the criminal process and away from the

25

stream of criminal proceedings and to protect them?

Is that the only reason for it, merely because
Or is if because whether misguided or well advised,

6

Isn't that

1

the background?

2

A

Mr» Chief Justice, yes, precisely, and wa make

3

no challenge to the policy of the legislators, which seem to he

4

uniform throughout the country, to establish separate courts

5

apart from the criminal process to try and deal with young

6

offenders.

7

which that policy is based.
Q

8
9

We don't challenge the legislative assumptions on

In New York is there a judgment of guilt on a

criminal act in this kind of proceeding?
A

10

He is found guilty of a law violation.

My only

11

contention is that within these specialized courts designed, as

12

you suggest, to save youngsters before they become perhaps non-

13

rehabilifcafcabls, if there is such a word, to offer them special

14

kinds of services, but. we only ask that within these special

15

courts that limitations of the Constitution apply so that funda-,

16

mental fairness is recognizes.
Q

1?
18

worlds, isn't it?

A

19

20

That is really a defense for the best of both

Yes, and I think a young offender is entitled to

that.
I would like to just for a moment deal with one of the

21

22

contentions that the city has raised- about this confinement procej

23

dure.

24

kinds of confinement that are based upon a preponderance of the

25

evidence and suggest this does not differ from those kinds of

The City of New York has suggested, well, there are other

7

1

confinement.

2

of mentally ill people, alcoholics and narcotics addicts.

3

And the city cites such things as the confinement

1 would .say

that it really strains the analogy to

4

compare this kind of a case with that kind of a case.

5

cases we are dealing essentially with distillation of medical

6

testimony relating to a physical or mental condition, expert

7

opinions subject to very honest differences of opinion of what

8

is an alcoholic or how sick is this person.

9

But here we are talking about did Johnny Jones do X

10

on Y night?

11

Q

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

In those

Well, let's assume you may be right with respect

to commitment of incompetents or narcotics addicts or alcoholics
and so on, but coming closer to home, right here in Haw York,
as I understand the city's arguments that children may be con­
fined and may be confined in substantially or exactly the same
place as this young man was confined after a finding that there
are persons in need of supervision.

And I would gather that

doesn't need all sort of expert testimony.
Would you concede thatin order to support a finding

20

that a young person is in need of supervision, that a preponder­

21

ance of the evidence is all thatis required?

22
23
24
25

A

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I would say that of

course there is some distinction, because in case we are talking
about a law violation and in another case not, but -- Q

But doesn't the young person — isn't it evidently
8

t

possible that he is goiiig to end up in the same institution?

2

A

It is very likely that he will.

I would say,

3

however, that the way the statute reads in New York, there is

4

some question.

5

practical matter, in New York the courts have required that when

6

someone is charged with being a person in need of supervision

7

and that he is incorrigible, that one may not merely accuse him

a

of being incorrigible.

9

conduct.

10

It is rather broadly defined.

However, as a

One must charge a specific act of mis­

One must show that Johnny Jones was out away from home

11

for two weeks from such and such a date to another date, that

12

he has bean drinking intoxicating beverages, that he is asso­

13

ciating with bad company, namely, Sam Smith, et cetera, et cetera,

14

and that must be proved.
Q

15

But none of these things so far that you have

16

mentioned -- and I suppose truancy would be another — would be

17

a criminal offense if committed by an adult?
A

18

Ij

No, it would not, but I suggest that the only

19

implication of the case today is that perhaps opinions cases,

20

as they are called, should also be proved beyond a reasonable

21

doubt.

22

Q

Yes, a person in these -—

23

A

And the reason I suggest that is that again, althc sue

24

it has' no corollary in criminal law, it is an allegation of mis­

25

conduct and it would seem intolerable for two boys to be in

9

1

precisely the same institution, one on a higher standard of

2

proof, one on'a lower standard of proof, both having been found

3

guilty of misconduct,,

4

And I would think that perhaps -- -

5

Q

6
7

Sc this arguendo you can see the city is right

to that extent in the whafc-are-we-coming-to argument?
A

Well, only to that extent»

The city has suggested

8

in its brief, well, if Court finds today that a finding pf

9

wrong-doing must meet high standards of reliability, that means

10

this whole panoply of criminal procedures will apply»

11

it will be jury trials and every other protection.

VI

I maintain that is absolutely not so.

I

That mean.';;

This is an

13

entirely separable issue.

It is perfectly possible for this

14

Court to find that it is required as a matter of fundamental

15

fairness, that the fact-finder is very certain of the child's

16

guilt and not accord or determine any of these other protections

17

It may well be that this Court will at some time deterI

18

mine that these other things are necessary, but certainly not as

19

a result of this case.

20

Q

Just so I understand it, 1 understood that you

21

would say that logic would compel the result that if a standard

22

of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is required here,

23

then the same standard would be required under the New York

24

system to prove that a young person was a person in need of

25

supervision?
10

?

A

Precisely,, yes, sir»

z

Q

You have to go no further in this case to prevail

3

and to say that where the charge against the delinquent is a

4

criminal charge, a charge of an act which if committed by another

5

would be a crime, and under no circumstances do you have to proves

6

beyond a reasonable doubt, or whatever label you put on it, is

7

required.

You don't have to go any further than that, do you?

3

A

I would say —-

9

Q

You might want to, but you don't have to?

10

A

You don’t have to, right,

11

Q

Do you want all these children put right into the

12

13

criminal court system, tried under full-scale criminal standards',
A

No, Your Honor,

1 think, if I may say --

1 think

14

that the intention of the reformers when the juvenile system

15

began in this country at the turn of the century was to try to

16

bring to bear upon the young offender whatever notions of psy-

17

chology, sociology, rehabilitation and early training that were-:

18

possible and deemed it advisable to do these in separate courts j

19

with different procedures.

20

1 think that, is per-

fectly appropriate.

22

important to note that that hope of the reformers will not be

24
25

;
l

j
I am not quarreling with that.

21

23

j

)

But I think maybe at this point it is

affected by a finding that the fact-finder be very sure that the
child has demonstrated a need for those rehabilitative services
and perhaps describing the New York system would best explain
j

11

j

\

1

how this works and why the holding that we urge today will not

2

detract what you conceive of as the efforts of the juvenile sys­

o

tem to rehabilitate youngsters„

4

Q

S

a criminal proceeding?

6

A

Aren't you moving every point in your case coward

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that this whafe

7

we are urging today is even more fundamental than the rights

8

afforded to children in Gault.

9

to be very sure the child who has committed the act r®Lly needs

I would say to ask the fact-finder

10

rehabilitation, that he be very certain of that, will change

11

the court in its everyday functioning much less than, for example,

12

according a child the privilege against self-incrimination.

13

That goes much closer to changing the posture of the

14

court, perhaps not in New York, but elsewhere, than a simple

15

requirement that before you give the child these services —

16

and there is some debate as to how effective they are — you mus.:

17

be very sure that he really needs them, that he has committed

18

that robbery, that shows that he needs help.

19
20

21

In New York, for example, if I may explain for a moment,
the hearing is a bifurcated one.

It is a two-stage proceeding.

The child is brought to the fact-finding hearing.

22

There he is given the petition that has the charge in it,, and

23

the judge hears the facts.

24

relevant and material evidence.

25

the judge at that time by New York statutes.

-

He may only consider competent,
.

No social history is permitted

12

They could have a

1

thick case folder on the family's problems and the boy’s psy­

2

chiatric history„ but the judge may not see it.

3

an independent determination whether the boy committed this act

He must make

4

5
6

Once that finding of guilt is made, the child must
attend what is known as a dispositional hearing.

7

Q

It is not, however, a finding of guilt as such?

8

A

It would be a euphemism to call it anything else.

9

Q

Well, explain the New York system.

10

What does

11

A

It is called a fact-finding.

12

Q

Isn’t that the predicate of the whole system.

13

Didn't the reformers who set up the system which the courts are

14

now dismantling piece by piece originally say that no lawyers

15

could be there?

16

be any newspaper reporters there and no one could mention his

17

name.

18
19
20

i

New York call it?

The judge wouldn't have a robe.

There couldn'tj

Weren't all these steps done to protect the child from
the traumatic experience of a criminal court setting?
A

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there x*?ere, but I think

21

Gault quite documented the fact that the hopes that the child

22

would stand to benefit from these procedures has not been real­

23

ized,' and I don't think here it would be appropriate to go into

a

24

reevaluation of how successful the system has been in New? York.

i
\
j

25

Q

The Court has started to do it.
13

1

A

Well, 1 would like to say in that respect that

2

the Court of Appeals in New York expressed the benefits to the

3

juveniles of —-

4
5

Q

I am speaking of this Court plus the fact that

it can evaluate the unwisdom of the system.

6

A

It has made that evaluation and, therefore, I --

7

Q

A very sound legislative evaluation probably.

8

A

A sound legislative evaluation to that extent -—

9

Q

That the system is working very well.

Is it up

10

to us to be amending it or up to the people who made it to be

11

amending it?

12

A

Well, I think we are not asking this court to
'
j
We are only saying that within the legislative struc­

13

amend it.

14

ture the elements of fair play prevail.

15
16

Q

It is simply that.

Is it your position that the only thing you are

complaining about is the standard?

17

A

IS

Q

Yes.
You don't complain about the judge, how he acts,

j

'

19

where the trial is, what the proceeding is, what the rules are? J

20

All you want is that ——

21

A

22

Q

You don't want to give up any other benefits.

23

A

That's right.

24
25

That is precisely right, Mr. Justice.

We want, Mr. Justice, as has been

said, the best of both worlds.

Q

And your rule was the rule when this case was
14

1

triad, this fellow would have been turned loose?

2

A

That’s right»

3

Q

Under the judge’s own statement?

4

A

That is right.

5

I think a word should be siad.

6

Q

Who was the judge?

7

A

Pardon me.

8

Q

Who was the trial judge?

9

A

It was a judge of the Family Court, Judge Midon-

Q

Mow did the Court of Appeals split — Judge

TO

ick„

IT

n

Keating and somebody else?
A

13
14
15

.

!

Judge (inaudible), Judge Keating, Judge Burke,

I believe.
I would like to make just one point about the alleged

18

that the Court of Appeals stressed in its opinion.

17

of Appeals in discussing the advantages to the child of this

18

so-called secrecy and non-stigma of the proceedings neglected,

19

of course, to underscore the harsh reality that when a child is

20

found guilty in this Court, he is subjected to substantial con­

21

finement in facilities which even in New York are subject to a

22

great deal of criticism.

23

The Court

Noxtf, the city in its brief has compounded this omission

24

by the Court of Appeals by again stressing the benefits of the

25

New York system and suggests that the problems with the institutio ns

15

i
i

;i

\

1

have never been shown to be relevant to New York.

And the; Attor

2

ney General in his
amicus brief doubly compounds this by actually

suggesting that this is a summer camp and that children just can t

4

wait to go to the training school.

of proof be high, even if these were model institutions.

7

cannot let the suggestion of the Attorney General go unconfcra-

8

dieted at this point.

But I

10

Society, one of the oldest private service organizations in New

11

York, has issued a report indicating that the facilities in New

12

York fire very poor indeed, that rehabilitation and counselling

i

A recent study by the New York Community Services

9

13

1

I would say here that we would insist that the standard

range from token to nonexistent, that there are inadequate pro-

|
visions not only for vocational training, but even ordinary
schooling.

;
Q

Aren31 these propositions that should be addressee
l

17
18
19
20

to the Legislature and not to this Court?
A

X only raised them here. Your Honor, because it

has been suggested by my adversary that all of these criticisms
that would make it a auesfcion of fundamental fairness to have a
.

21

22
23
24

25

high standard of proof are not relevant to New York because
New York's institutions are so "marvelous."

And X would just
!

suggest that this is totally contrary to the fact, and that there
are, in short, ample basis for the conclusion of the Commujnity
Services Society that the children in these institutions validly
16

1

view their stay as "doing time."

2

Q

jt

there, too?

4

A

Yes, they do.

People in need of supervision?

Yes, they do, indeed.

Thank you.

MR. BUCHSBAUM;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
2

*

i

At the outset 1 want to take a moment on the findings ;

2

by the Court below.

3

suggest that the judge in the Family Court said that if the

4

standard of proof was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he woulc

5

have reached a different result.

6

I think it may be a little misleading to

And earlier in my brief I dussed this in quotes from

7

the appendix as to what happened at that point, and if this

8

becomes an element in the case, which I rather doubt, I think

9

the Court should look at what happened, because the judge made

10

his finding in accordance with the law, and then counsel for

11

the child started what ended up as a philosophic discussion about

12

the various standards of proof.

13

remarks which in the appellant's brief have all been telescoped,

14

even though they are a page apart, and gives the feeling that

IS

he is talking about this particular case, when apparently he is

16

talking about determinations in general.

17

And the judge then made some

Now let me turn to the central issue.

The question is

18

whether the Constitution requires that in proceedings of this kind

19

there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the pre­

20

ponderance of evidence standard is inadequate.

21

22

Now there is no specific constitutional provision, so i
the question comes down to whether due process requires it.

23

as I see it, that either must go along one of two paths*

24

that in a criminal case, you must have such proof — and this

23

is a criminal case

Andj

Either!

or, two, the nature of what happens after

22

1

this proceedings, the loss of liberty, the incarceration, the

2

possibility of that* is of such a nature that clue process

3

required that standard of proof.

4

Aside from those two paths, 1 cannot see how this can

5

be decided as a constitutional question.

6

cussion we have had in this field,, and I have seen it in some

?

opinions and articles, discuss this without referring to the

3

Constitution, the assumption that due process is what I think

0

is wise and if X think this is wise, the Constitution requires

10

it.
Obvicusly this Court does not approach this problem

11
12

n

Now much of the dis­

|i
that way.
Now, let's see whether this is a criminal proceeding

14

and here I suggest, that Mr. Justice Portas, in the Gault opinion,

13

was writing far ranging.

IS

nile system and he was dealing with a case which at least to me

17

seemed quite, horrendous.

He was writing about the entire juve­

And what he did was, from all the

l

18

v/riti.ngs e studies, very often students at law school who proba­

19

20

He was picking out all the things that went, wrong.
\

21

Something went wrong Oregon which didn't go wrong in any other

22

state, it was listed.

of whether the Court is the equivalent of a criminal court.

18

see two bases for selecting the juvenile delinquency proceeding

done to improve it* we do find in New York there is a constant

8

While 1 hesitated to speak of the manner of confinement, without

that the training schools operate under a college unit system,
which generally is made up of semi-independent groups, many of
which are limited to 20 young people.
They are in an open setting without the restraint of
locks or bax*s, that house parents live on the premises and act
as guides and mentors as well as supervisors, that home visits
are made by the boys and girls on a regular basis, and vocational
and academic features are provided.
Perhaps this is the ideal that they aim at and don't
perhaps always comply, but this is what they are trying to do.
Q

As suggested by this Chief Justice, and Mrs.

23

Uviller directed herself to this, this really doesn’t have much

24

to do with the issue before us, does it, except insofar as it

25

may go to whether or not what happened here was equivalent of
30

1

the finding of guilt and the imposition of punishment*

And if

2

it is tantamount to that and if the Constitution requires that

3

in a criminal case where the issue is the determination of guilt

4

and the imposition of punishment of due process or some other

5

provision of the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable-

6

doubts, then Mrs, Bvilier is correct.

7

But whether or not these are well or badly run insti­

8

tutions or how many housemothers they have and how big the cot­

9

tages are and so on, except insofar as it goes to your submis­

HO

sion maybe that this is not the equivalent of guilt and punish­

n

ment, those issues are really for the New York State Legisla­

12

ture? .

33

A

Exactly,

Now Justice Marshall has suggested that

14

the mere fact that this starts off was an act that would a

15

crime, and everything flaws QED, X think that suggestion — and

m

it must be treated as a crime and all these trimmings that you

17

are, putting on it, all you have got is a criminal court trying

18

a criminal case, which somebody — as you do in a criminal court,

19

And therefore, at least in approach -- in answer to

20

that approach, X think it is important to consider every element

21

from the intake procedure where even though the petition is

22

drawn up which says that the child committed an act, which would

23

be a crime by an adult, and a substantial portion of the case

24

is they review this and never reach the fact-finding stage and

25

they decide even though the evidence was there, this doesn't
31

1

call for a juvenile delinquency proceeding for this child.

2

Through the dispositional hearing whereafter the evi­

3

dence may he proved on a basis which goes far beyond the unrea­

4

sonable doubt and absolute certainty, nevertheless there is no

5

finding of juvenile delinquency, that the child doesn’t need

Q

confinement or supervision.
Q

7
8

Well, then the problem doesn’t arise that this

case presents?
A

9

Yes, but I am suggesting that all these elements

10

should be considered in deciding whether this is really a crimi­

It

nal proceeding.
Q

!2

Now if
Aren’t you really arguing that because of the

13

protection put around a juvenile in this special court proceed­

14

ings and all, that is balanced off as an excuse for not using

IS

reasonable doubt as a standard?
A

16

Is that what you are arguing?

I can only respond this way.

That when this

17

started off, Judge Julian Mack, Roscoe Pound and others who

IS

were the strong proponents of the Childrens Court certainly did

19

not think that they had found a way of evading the constitutional

requirements with respect to criminal lav?, and I respectfully

They want to keep all of the other parts, all of the good

A

What 1 thought I was trying to do was to try

7

to analyse whether there is a constitutional requirement that

8

in this type of proceeding there must be proof beyond a reason-

9

able doubt.

I didn’t think 1 was trying to distort the nature

10

of the proceeding.

I thought 1 was trying to analyse it as to

11

whether a juvenile delinquency court, a juveniIs proceeding as

52

designed by its original proponents as revised over the years,

53

was an attempt to have due process requirement, is subject to a

14

further constitutional requirement, than you must prove the

15

wrong-doing beyond a reasonable doubt or the improper conduct.

n

Q

17

Suppose this child has not been a child, but had been

18

25 years old and charged with a, crime. Do you think the Consti­

19

tution requires the proof to convict — constitutionally, now I

20

am not. talking about anything but the Constitution — requires

21

the proof to be shown beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt?

22
23
24

25

A

May I ask you one or two questions?

Put as Your Honor put it, do you think — charged

with a crime ——
Q

Charged with a crime.

Do you think that the

Constitution requires that his proof of guilt be shown beyond a
33

1

reasonable doubt„ or that it could be satisfied by showing that

z

he is guilty by a preponderance of the evidence?
A

3

I have found no case that decides that issue,

4

I would be inclined to think that this Court probably, if faced

5

with that issue, would reach the conclusion that there must be

6

proof beyond a reasonable doubt,

7

I think it would say that

3

Q

9

They would have to do that on the basis of a

criterion that I don't agree to, of course, which is a question

10

of stance.

If we have a right to decide what is fair and if

It

we decide it is not fair, it is unconstitutional.
Q

IS

Not necessarily, because just recently Judge Full

13

in New York, in his defense in this case he would say -™ or

14

could argue, at least, that the requirement of a finding of

IS

beyond a reasonable doubt was necessary to maintain the integrity

IS

of the Fifth Amendment, unless a juvenile is not a person within

17
1©

the meaning of the Fifth. Amendment.

And that was his argument,

wasn't it?
A

19

Perhaps I misread it.

I didn't quite read it

20

Q

He ties it to the Fifth Amendment.

I don't know

if that is his argument, but the Fifth Amendment uses the words
"shall be compelled in any criminal case” and the Sixth Amendment
34

I

uses the phrase "in all criminal prosecutions."

2

So the question really is whether assuming the reason­

3

able doubt standard is applicable, whether this is a criminal

4

case or whether it is a criminal prosecution*
A

I am afraid I am a little dull on that, because

6

there is no claim here that the child is required to give any

7

evidence against himself.

9

Q

How what —

'1 am not saying that he was.

I am just saying

in terms of what you call the proceeding, a criminal proceeding,

«0

the Constitution calls a criminal case or criminal prosecution,

11

whether or not those standards would come in on this kind of a

12

proceeding.

13

A

Well, that is the essence of the question, and

14

that is why 1 keep speaking about whether this is truly a crimi­

15

nal proceeding and why I suggest that, you can't decide it is a

16

criminal proceeding just because the trigger that starts it off

17

is an act which, if done by an adult, would be crime.
Q

18

Isn't the corollary to that statement, if done

19

by an adult would be a crime, that if it is not done by an adult

20

it is not a crime?

zt

A

Certainly that is the intent of the New York law.

22

Q

I should think it would be the only logical

23
24
25

corollary.
A

Well, I think in justice to the other side, if

that were a deliberate intent to mislead — well even, if it were
35

i

not deliberate.

In fact, what you really had was a criminal

z

case, then just labeling it as not being a criminal case would

3

not get by.
But it is not merely the label, it is not merely call­

4
S

ing it a civil proceeding that makes it any less criminal in

6

this case.

7

from beginning to end in every feature of it, is this a criminal

8

proceeding?

The question is, looking at the thing as a whole

in New York.
It has also been suggested that -- certainly my argu­
ment — if you reach this conclusion, then you must end up with
a jury trial in juvenile court.

And if you reach it on the basis

of this being a criminal proceeding, my suggestion is that if
you base it on loss of liberty, that this may have an impact
on the insanity proceedings and the narcotic addict proceedings
and the civil contempt proceedings are not the issues before
this Court.
But I submit that in this case the Court will decide

2!

which path will be taken down a certain hill, and it is hard for

22

me to conceive ever going back up that hill.

Somebody

14

found out in the District of Columbia that there is such a risk,

15

and there seems to be an assumption that there is such a risk

16

in New York.

Q

Well, as I remember the brief, it was represented

13

that as a matter of fact and perhaps of law if this person later

19

as an adult commits a criminal offense, is found guilty of a

20

criminal offense, then his juvenile record is made available to

21

the sentencing judge.

22

The sentencing judge, yes.

Is that a violation of the law in Mew York?
