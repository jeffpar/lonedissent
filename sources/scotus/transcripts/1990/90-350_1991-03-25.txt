ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This is a case about bankruptcy and divorce,

11

about the relationship between Federal law and State law,

12

and about fundamental fairness for one woman.

Farrey left a Wisconsin courtroom about 4 years ago with

half of the property from her long marriage, only to lose

it all a few months later in the Federal bankruptcy

of no help to your client or many others in her position.

2

So far as future cases, if the court had anticipated this

3

could it have just ordered the husband to execute a

4

mortgage on the property?

5

MR. WILLIAMSON:

6

interesting question.

7

to say to Mr. Sanderfoot sign a mortgage, but that would

not have made it, sir, any less a judicial lien under the

expansive definition that Congress has provided in section

Justice Kennedy, that raises an

QUESTION:

One of the great difficulties

Do you have settled authority for

that proposition?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

No, Your Honor, there Is no

16

settled authority.

Indeed, as we have discussed in the

17

brief, one issue that may follow this case to this

18

courtroom, given the appropriate resolution of the case,

19

is what happens in consensual divorces, stipulated

20

divorces, where the parties come to the court and say

21

we've reached an agreement, it is not contested.

22

in most States, including Wisconsin, the courts still have

23

to enter a judgment that adopts the stipulation.

24

Congress, whatever it has done with the Bankruptcy Code,

25

has provided in the definition sections on lien and

But yet

And

This Court's decision —
QUESTION:

So that in that hypothesis a property

settlement agreement which is recorded and the parties
exchange a deed and mortgage, and the court adopts -enters a decree based on that, still the mortgage would be
a judicial lien?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

I don't think there is any question about that.

Under 101

U.S. Code subsection 32 a judicial lien means a lien
obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal
or equitable process or proceeding.

A number of lower

courts in situations like this have called this an
equitable lien, have tried to suggest that it is not a
judicial lien.

But it would be very difficult for me to

come here and suggest that it isn't a judicial lien,
because it was a lien imposed by a court in a divorce
judgment, and that's going to happen whether or not it's a
stipulated divorce or, like this case, a divorce in which
every issue, including the division of property, was
contested.
QUESTION:

Well, as the case comes to us you

concede that it's a judicial lien?
MR. WILLIAMSON:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And we have to worry, then, about the

meaning of section 522(f) and how that plays out in this

2

context, right?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

4

That's correct, Justice

0'Connor.
QUESTION:

5

At bottom, is that a matter of State

law as to when the lien fixes?

7

here that would determining the fixing, when the lien

fixed?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

9

And what is the State law

Your Honor, the definition of

10

the Federal statute, and to be precise the definition of

11

the phrase "the fixing of a lien" is a matter of Federal

law.

14

we have to understand, this entire debate occurs in --

15

And of course we contend that Congress used the

QUESTION:

Don't you think the Federal law of

16

necessity refers back to State law as to when and how a

17

lien is fixed?

18

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Absolutely.

And what happened

19

in this case was two things, two things that intimately

20

involve State law and State public policy.

21

judge said to the parties in this case I am going to award

22

the homestead to the husband, but as a condition of that

23

award I am going to make it subject to a lien in favor of

the spouse, the petitioner here, to ensure that there is a

fair and equitable division of State law.

QUESTION:

11

Yeah, but could you answer my

12

question and tell me under State law exactly when the lien

13

was fixed here?

14

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Under State law, Your Honor,

the lien fixed at the moment the judge entered the divorce

judgment.

district judge in this case, found that the title interest

in Mr. Sanderfoot and the lien interest in Ms. Farrey were

better than the other side.

2

even if we accept your principal theory, if the husband —

3

if the property was in the husband's name and then this

4

same thing happened, it was not in their joint names, it

5

was solely in his name, and if there is no State law that

theory of the case would still allow the husband to get

QUESTION:

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Yes.
And then the divorce court in

its judgment awarded a lien, imposed a lien on it, then we

would probably not be here today and I would not quarrel

18

with the court's order or suggestion.

19

QUESTION:

Right.

So the point is that your

20

prologue about how, you know, not going along with you

21

will make for unfair divorce proceedings, really sort of

22

misses the point, because no matter what you do you're

23

going to have some unfair divorce proceedings, even on

24

your theory of the case.

No, Justice Scalia, and if

1

you'll forgive me, I do want to quarrel with your premise.

2

Because what we're asking the Court to do is not guarantee

3

that divorce judgments are equal across the country, even

4

though virtually every State now provides for some kind of

5

equitable 50-50 division subject to different factors.

6

What we're asking this Court to do is to prevent the

7

Federal Bankruptcy Code from being used as a device to

8

upset a fair and equitable division.

9

any confusion on this point.

10

^

QUESTION:

There should not be

You're not saying that.

You're

11

saying it shouldn't be used to upset a fair division

12

unless the husband has sole title to the property from the

13

outset.

14

Right?

15

Then it can be used to upset a fair division.

MR. WILLIAMSON:

If the husband had sole title,

16

Your Honor, the trial judge could have, and no doubt would

17

have, taken other steps to correct the difficulty.

18

QUESTION:

On that point, I thought Wisconsin

19

law was quite specific that all property of the spouses is

20

presumed to be marital property, and that each spouse has

21

an undivided one-half interest.

22

despite the State of the title?

23
24

MR. WILLIAMSON:

So isn't that true

That's precisely correct, Your

Honor.

Justice Scalia, then, that if the property had all been in

QUESTION:

You pushed me beyond my hypothetical.

I said, I said assuming that the State did not have an

such law, and you sort of volunteered that Wisconsin did.

17

And I don't know whether Wisconsin does or doesn't,

18

frankly.

19

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy

20

is absolutely correct.

21

our briefs, Wisconsin law — and there is just no dispute

22

about this -- Wisconsin law provides for co-ownership of

23

marital property.

24

And that's why in this case it really doesn't matter

25

whether Ms. Farrey and her husband held the title as joint

And as we make clear, I think, in

The entire marital estate is co-owned.

MR. WILLIAMSON:

QUESTION:

9

Both.

Legally co-owned?
Yes, sir.

So it really doesn't matter whether

you take it out in your own name or not.
MR. WILLIAMSON:

10

It does not.

In addition, in

11

1986, effective in early 1986, Wisconsin passed a form of

12

marital property law that reinforces the statutory and

13

case law that up to then had made precisely that point.

14

MR. WILLIAMSON:

But it's your theory that the

15

marital community is really' an entity of its own and that

16

that changes when there is a divorce decree entered and

17

the property is dissolved -- and the property is

18

distributed?

19

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Yes.

At that point the divorce

20

judge has to make a decision about how to divide this

21

property.

22

judge faced in this case is really quite commonplace.

23

This family had a home and some land in Hortonville,

24

Wisconsin, not too far from Greenbay and Appleton, and it

25

was their primary asset.

And the practical problem that the divorce

Yet a home by definition, except for example in

denied by the bankruptcy judge, and then in relatively

17

quick succession reversed by the Federal district judge,

18

and in a 2 to 1 decision reversed by the court of appeals.

QUESTION:

presented the issue of the phrase "the fixing of."

Now, Mr. Sanderfoot had an interest in the

homestead equivalent to Ms. Farrey's interest in the

And Mr. Sanderfoot would not have received that entire

Now —

QUESTION:

9

But that's not what the lien

The lien attached to the entire interest.

Could you say that the lien fixed

part on his interest and part on her interest, both of

10

which are recognized as being one-half interest, and that

11

one is avoidable and the other is not?
MR. WILLIAMSON:

12

Well, we have thought about

13

that possibility, Your Honor, and in the first place it

14

assumes that Ms. Farrey could have had a lien on her own

15

interest which, whatever the doctrine of merger might say,

16

seems, seems a bit awkward to have a lien on your own

17

interest.

18

have said I will place a lien on Mr. Sanderfoot's half

19

interest.

20

it would have been unnatural for that to have happened

21

here because everything about this divorce case was

22

ordinary, everything about this divorce case was done by

23

the book under State law, until it got to the bankruptcy

24

process.

But it is possible for the divorce judge to

1

in real estate, a whole fee interest, is equivalent to two

2

divisible half interests, but it's a different interest

3

from two indivisible half interests?

4

indivisible half interest in property is simply a

different, different estate.

If it were half of the fee you could say that he did have

Yes, you could.

Justice Scalia, that in this case the Federal district

It's clear, Justice Kennedy,

probably the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 as well, this Court in

I guess they should have written the

QUESTION:

Mr. Williamson, why, if your theory

should prevail, why didn't Congress just add another word

6

in 523(a)(5) and instead of excepting merely child

7

support, alimony, and maintenance obligations, put in some

8

other category there that would provide an exception for

9

security for the property settlement?

10

MR. WILLIAMSON:

Your Honor, clearly Congress

11

could have done that, but we believe that the Bankruptcy

12

Code, and there is plenty of legislative history on this

13

point, supports the conclusion of Congress and our

14

contention that there was no need for that kind of

language because security interests, like mortgages,

always survive bankruptcy.

The personal obligation may not be enforceable.

that judgment.

That's a security interest.

MR. WILLIAMSON:

2

Justice Scalia, the difficulty

3

is that Congress, in defining a security interest, limited

4

it, and it's in subsection 47 of the definitional

5

sections, limited that interest to consensual liens.

6

defined a lien, defined a judicial lien, and it defined a

security interest.

8

it's hard to escape the fact that it was a security

interest imposed in a judicial proceeding which, I believe

It

Even if this were a security interest

unfortunately, makes it a judicial lien.
We ask that this Court reverse the judgment of

11

12

the U.S. court of appeals and that it reinstate the

of the former owner, he buys the real estate with a

No, no, no.

If he purchased the

property from someone — let me make it easier.

Sanderfoot, who had a lien against the property, a

judicial lien against it, had sold the property to a third

person, and then that third person went bankrupt.

10

MR. SAMSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SAMSON:

A quit claim deed?
Sure.
In my opinion with a quit claim

13

deed, yes, it would be subject to the prior owner's lien,

14

assuming that you could not avoid the lien under State

15

law, which would allow a homestead exemption clause.

16

QUESTION:

But the new owner would not be able

17

to avoid that lien under the Bankruptcy Code, because the

18

lien did not fix upon any interest of that new owner.

19

Correct?

If he paid for it, it may well fix

on an interest of his, assuming he can -- it's a homestead

MR. SAMSON:

In the State of Wisconsin, Justice

2

Kennedy, there is a presumption that all property in a

marriage is marital in nature and subject to division.

4

There has been confusion since 1986 in the State of

5

Wisconsin since the passage of the Wisconsin Marital

6

Property Act regarding the term marital property.

7

State, a State appeals court in the Kuhlman case, which we

8

have cited in our brief, specifically says that marital

9

property law, which is chapter 766 of the Wisconsin

10
11

statute, has no effect whatsoever on divorce.
QUESTION:

And the

None.

Is either party, is either spouse

free to alienate his or her share of the marital property

But

15

that has been the law since well prior to that.

section that allows division of property, specifically

it deems appropriate.

QUESTION:

However,

Well, that seems to me, then, to

It is in bankruptcy not the economic circumstances of the

If it

3

you acquire the property, it can.

4

with a situation right in the middle.

5

And we're trying to figure out how the Bankruptcy Code

6

would treat that.

And we're faced here
It's simultaneous.

7

Why shouldn't I be guided by the fact that under

8

(f)(1) (2) the code makes it clear that it does not want to

9

allow the discharge of purchased money security interests,

10

that is to say even though you can get out of security

11

interests in personal property, all sorts of it, you

12

cannot get out of purchased money security interests in

13

personal property.

14

Now, why shouldn't I think that the code feels

15

the same way about real estate, that basically where there

16

is a simultaneously, a simultaneous creation of your

17

interest and the lien, which is what happens with a

18

purchased money security interest, you should not be able

19

to get out of it?

20

the code, the people who did (f)(2) would have felt that

21

way about the question before us, that this is sort of a

22

purchased money-type arrangement?

23

Don't you think that the drafters of

MR. SAMSON:

No, Justice Scalia, I don't think

24

so, because the code also defines purchaser as being a

voluntary transferee.

Oh, I'm not saying it technically

I'm just saying it's the same philosophy

if it's, you know, the simultaneous fixing of the lien

with the acquiring of the interest.

QUESTION:

MR. SAMSON:

Again, that is one of the key

6

terms, is "an interest."

And I don't believe that you can

7

look at that, at the term the fixing of a lien, without

8

looking at the next phrase, an interest.

9

It doesn't say all of the interest.

the term "any."

12

13

the fixing of a lien on any interest of the debtor in

14

exempt property.

15

So if you start, if you look at that

And -- you had asked a question previously

16

regarding the question of if it's fixed prior to

17

bankruptcy or fixing after the filing, clearly it cannot

18

fix after the filing because there's an automatic stay.

19

It would not occur in any event.
The question is, the term "fixing," is it used

21

as a term of art, which I don't believe it is.

22

23

of bankruptcy.

the only one with any interest in this particular piece of

I think that the more basic —

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you look at the date of

7

the filing, it seems to me you ought to look at the fixing

8

as of the date of the filing too.

9

proves too much for you.

I think that argument

Because if you look at

10

everything at the date of the filing, you say you're only

11

concerned about post-filing fixing.

12

there's another objection, the automatic stay —

MR. SAMSON:

QUESTION:

-- but it seems to me there's some

tension between your saying well, for fixing purposes we

QUESTION:

So you just read it out?

I mean, as

8

I understand your theory, Congress might as well have said

instead of the fixing of a lien on an interest of the

They didn't say that, and we need

15

clearly Mr. Sanderfoot, when this lien attached, had an

interest in this home.

think that it obviously impairs an interest of his.
