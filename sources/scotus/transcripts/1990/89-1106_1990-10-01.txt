Mr. Sheldon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER S. SHELDON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SHELDON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the constitutionality of a

12

value-added tax, specifically the Michigan Single Business

13

Tax, which is known more commonly as the SBT.

14

comes to this Court on stipulated facts from a decision of

15

the Michigan Supreme Court that upheld the tax against

16

petitioner's constitutional challenge.

17

There are two questions presented.

The case

The first

18

question is whether the three-factor property payroll and

19

sale apportionment formula that is contained in the SBT

20

taxes value added outside of Michigan and produces a

21

grossly distorted result in violation of the Due Process

22

and Commerce Clauses.

23

same three-factor apportionment formula discriminates in

24

favor of in-State businesses and against petitioner and

25

other similarly situated out-of-State businesses by

The second question is whether that

1

systematically and irrationally reducing the tax bases of

2

the former, while systematically and irrationally

3

increasing the tax bases of the latter.

4

The primary points we make are these.

5

the tax base of the SBT, like the tax base of all value-

6

added taxes, consists primarily of site-specific

7

components, and those site-specific components,

8

principally compensation and depreciation, are readily

9

susceptible to precise identification and allocation on a

First,

10

State-by-State basis.

11

know where the labor is performed, and therefore where

12

value added by the labor takes place.

13

depreciable plant is located, and therefore where value

14

added by depreciable plant takes place.

15

They are site specific because you

You know where the

For the average SBT taxpayer the record in this

16

case shows that its tax base consists of compensation to

17

the extent of 77 percent, capital to the extent of another

18

17 percent, and profit to a much lesser extent, only about

19

6 percent.

20

dominate.

21

those site-specific components are even more dominant,

22

because here also the record clearly shows by stipulation

23

that Trinova's tax base consisted of compensation to the

24

extent of 102 percent, depreciation to the extent of

25

another 11 percent, and profit, profit added not 1 cent of

So you can see the site-specific components
And for Trinova, the petitioner in this case,

1

positive contribution to the value-added tax base.

2

that is because Trinova, during the 1980 tax year that is

3

at issue here, incurred a significant loss from its

4

operations.
QUESTION:

5

Suppose the facts were different and

6

profit produced the greatest factor.

7

of the tax violate the Constitution as applied?
MR. SHELDON:

8

9

And

Would the operation

Perhaps not, Your Honor, if -- if

Trinova had had a tax base that was comprised of the

10

profit component to a significant extent.

But in this

11

case the contribution of profit to the value-added tax

12

base component was zero.

13

contribution.

In fact it was a negative

14

Now because these site-specific components are

15

susceptible to allocation, there is no need to apportion

16

that.

17

QUESTION:

18

Justice Blackmun's question?

19

between the adversaries in this case that in the general -

20

- throughout the general run of taxpayers that the site-

21

specific components is around 90 percent?

22

May I interrupt to -- to follow up on

MR. SHELDON:

Is there an agreement

It's not a matter of stipulation,

23

Justice Stevens, but in the merits brief, appendix la

24

contains a publication from the Department of Treasury

25

that clearly sets forth for the average taxpayer what

1

their components of tax base are.

2

clearly, the compensation component is dominant and

3

constitutes approximately 77 percent of the average

4

taxpayer's tax base.

5

QUESTION:

And there, very

Mr. Sheldon, let me put this question

6

in terms of one of the examples given in one of the briefs

7

taken from a law review article, as I recall.

8

statement was made that a tax upon — upon sleeping,

9

measured by the number of shoes in your closet, is in fact

10
11

a tax upon shoes.

The

Do you agree with that?

MR. SHELDON:

The point, Justice Scalia, is that

12

a tax has to be analyzed, in testing its constitutionality

13

under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, in terms of

14

its practical effect, in terms of its economic reality.

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MR. SHELDON:

And here, this tax, by whatever

17

label it may be called, is in practical effect and more

18

than anything else a tax on compensation.

19
20

QUESTION:

Well, suppose you, you could have --

we have approved gross receipts taxes, right?

21

MR. SHELDON:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now why isn't, why aren't they just

23

as discriminatory against out-of-State, some out-of-State

24

companies, and just as contrary to the other principles

25

that you are urging as this tax is?

1

MR. SHELDON:

Well, a gross receipts tax is

2

generally aimed at determining a tax base that relates to

3

the gross receipts, the actual gross receipts that is

4

derived from activity within the taxing State.

5

have here is not a gross receipts tax.

6

added tax, and the measure of the tax base is something

7

different from a gross receipts tax.

11

QUESTION:
Michigan, right?

What we

We have a value-

The measure is the receipts in

I mean, that's the measure that you

complain about.
MR. SHELDON:

The tax base of a value-added tax

12

base that uses the additive method of calculation, such as

13

the Michigan SBT, is comprised of —

14
15

QUESTION:

What you claim distorts this is the

fact that they are using Michigan sales, isn't that it?

16

MR. SHELDON:

17

QUESTION:

That is correct.

But they could tax you 100 percent on

18

Michigan sales, and we would say it's okay.

19

view this as not really a tax on value added or on

20

anything else, but just as a tax on gross receipts in

21

Michigan, we would say fine.

22

on shoes rather than on sleeping, this is okay.

23

MR. SHELDON:

So if you

So if you believe it's a tax

But it's not a tax on gross

24

receipts, Your Honor, it's a tax on value added.

25

you look at the value added components of tax base, the

And when

principal component is compensation.

QUESTION:

Well, this, this is a tax on value

added, the same way the first tax I mentioned to you was a

tax on sleeping.

sales, it is a tax on Michigan sales.

have said that is okay.

If they are measuring it by Michigan

MR. SHELDON:

9

It doesn't matter whether they say its a

So what?

And we

But the measure of the tax, Your

Honor, is not Michigan sales.

The measure of the tax, the

10

tax base is the compensation payments that the taxpayer

11

makes

15

QUESTION:
that is okay.

You have no complaint about that,

That isn't what distorts it here, right.

MR. SHELDON:

What distorts it, Your Honor, is

the inclusion of an equally weighted sales factor --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SHELDON:

18

apportionment formula.

19

sales factor does is that it skews the attribution of the

20

major site-specific component of a value-added tax base,

21

which is compensation.

22

QUESTION:

Michigan sales.
— in the three-factor
And what that equally-weighted

But Justice Scalia's point is that

23

the State of Michigan could have disregarded the site-

24

specific factors and taxed you solely on your gross

25

receipts, and you would be right about at the same place.

In fact, you would probably be in worse shape.
MR. SHELDON:

2

But -- that may be true, Your

3

Honor, but the State of Michigan has not elected to tax

4

gross receipts.

It has elected to tax value added, and -

right?

MR. SHELDON:

9

QUESTION:

But you just acknowledged that that

doesn't matter.

11

you measure it by is what the tax is imposed on.

13

It doesn't matter what you call it.

MR. SHELDON:

What

Your -- Your Honor, and the

measure of the tax is value added.
QUESTION:

This is a tax on sleeping, not on

14

15

shoes.
MR. SHELDON:

16

The practical effect of the tax,

17

we submit, Your Honor, is a tax on value added, and the

18

only way that Michigan could exact a positive contribution

19

of tax from Trinova in this case is by taxing extra­

20

territorial value, which the Due Process and Commerce

21

Clauses —

I am saying that —

It's a tax on sleeping, you say,

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there another answer to

23

Justice Scalia?

Two different taxpayers, one situated as

24

you are and another one with precisely the same gross

25

receipts in Michigan, pay vastly different taxes.

2

MR. SHELDON:

That's correct.

That's correct,

Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

So it's not a tax on gross receipts.

4

MR. SHELDON:

That is my point.

If this tax, as

5

we contend, is unconstitutional because it taxes extra­

6

territorial value and produces a grossly distorted result,

7

or because it is discriminatory, the fact that Michigan

8

could have imposed a plainly valid gross receipts tax and

9

generated as much revenue as a result of that can't be

10

used as a legal justification for excusing or saving the

11

unconstitutional infirmities of this tax.

12

QUESTION:

Is it all that clear?

You keep

13

calling this a site-specific tax.

14

conceded by the State that this allocation is so precise?

15

Suppose -- these were sales people mostly in Michigan?

16

MR. SHELDON:

17

QUESTION:

Is it going to be

That is correct, Your Honor.

Suppose that the sales people were

18

very, very important in giving information to the

19

manufacturing component in the other State about the

20

design requirements for this glass.

21

contributed a very, very significant amount to sales and

22

to the overall success of the company just by their

23

contribution to what was happening back in Iowa.

24

all that clear to me that this is site specific.

25

MR. SHELDON:

And suppose that they

It's not

sales activity, including, for instance, the intangible
contributions of centralized management, functional

3

integration, and economies of scale may indeed impact and

4

influence taxpayer decisions that relate to the employment

5

and deployment of labor, and to the acquisition and

6

location of depreciable plant.

7

that sales activity and these other intangible factors may

8

also influence taxpayer decisions as to the amount that

9

may be paid for those value-adding activities.

10

And we acknowledge also

But the fact nevertheless remains that when

11

those taxpayer decisions are implemented, you will still

12

know precisely where that value-adding activity takes

13

place, and you will know precisely the amount of value

J 14

added by that activity.

The influence or the efficiencies

15

that may be generated by sales activity or by these

16

intangible contributions of centralized management and the

17

like will be reflected only in the measure of the profit

18

component of a value-added tax base.

19

QUESTION:

Well, why is that necessarily so?

20

mean it might be or it might not be.

You are saying that

21

labor is so site specific that it must be, without

22

variation, apportioned precisely to the amount of activity

23

that is economically measurable by a payroll.

24

just contrary to economic theory, isn't it, and to the

25

concession that you just made that there are a lot of

But that's

1

intangible factors that go to make up the success of a

2

unitary business?

3

MR. SHELDON:

The intangible factors only impact

4

on the measure of the profit component of a value-added

5

tax base, which we acknowledge may be properly subjected

6

to three-factor formulary apportionment.

7

added taxing principles, and indeed as confirmed by

8

language that is contained in the Single Business Tax Act

9

itself, and indeed even as the Michigan Supreme Court has

But under value-

10

noted, the measure of value added by labor and capital,

11

specifically the compensation and depreciation

12

contributions to those components, is the taxpayer's cost.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SHELDON:

15

I don't understand why that is.
Well, translated, the cost with

respect to the labor component is what the taxpayer pays
%

16

its employees for the services they have performed.

17

with respect to depreciation, translated, the cost is the

18

amount of capital consumed during the accounting period

19

that is measured by tax depreciation.

20

Tax Act itself, Your Honor, in section 9 specifically

21

defines the contribution of labor to a value-added tax

22

base in terms of what the employer pays its employees.

23

And

The Single Business

There is no transferred value concept that

24

There is no enhanced value concept that

applies here.

1

the labor contribution is what the employer pays for.

2

the same is true, and section 9 of the SBT confirms this,

3

with respect to the depreciation component of the SBT.

4

QUESTION:

And

Is it your theory that the

5

constitution requires that the State adopt the most

6

precise mechanism available for apportionment, given the

7

theory of the tax?
MR. SHELDON:

8

9

We say, Your Honor, that with

respect to the site-specific components of a value-added

10

tax base, there is no need to apportion them.

11

to say that the State could not come up with an

12

apportionment formula that might fairly reflect the

13

contributions of labor and depreciation to Michigan, even

14

though that formula might not derive an absolutely precise

15

result.

16

think we would have a constitutional problem here.

17

That is not

If it didn't result in gross distortion, I don't

But in this case, in this case application of

18

the three-factor formula against petitioner's tax base for

19

the 1980 year has attributed to Michigan compensation that

20

is 39 times more than value added by petitioner's

21

Michigan-based employees, and then it has attributed to

22

Michigan depreciation expense that is 970 times more than

23

the value added by the capital consumption that is

24

association with petitioner's Michigan-based plant.

25

QUESTION:

How large does a discrepancy like

1

that have to be before you say the Constitution prohibits

2

it?

3

Where — where would you ever draw the line?
MR. SHELDON:

Well, Justice O'Connor, in the

4

Hans Rees case, of course, a distortion of 250 percent, or

5

about 2.5 times, was found to be significant, enough to

6

justify a holding in the taxpayer's favor.

Here we have

7

distortion that is many multiples of that.

It is between

8

39 and 970 times, depending upon which of these more —

9

QUESTION:

Suppose that the taxpayer did have a

10

sizable profit, unlike the taxpayer we have in this case.

11

How should the State apportion that part of the —

12

MR. SHELDON:

We have no quarrel with the

13

application of the three-factor apportionment formula

14

against the profit component of the value-added tax base,

15

because, as this Court has observed on many prior

16

occasions, and which we do not contest, income is

17

difficult to source on a State-by-State basis.

18

again is because net income results from the coalescence

19

of a number of different factors, some of which are site

20

specific, but some of which, like centralized management,

21

economies of scale, and the like, are not.

22

And that

But as to the compensation and depreciation

23

contributions to the labor and capital components of a

24

value-added tax base, those items, unlike net income, are

25

site specific.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. -- surely Michigan is entitled to

2

take into consideration the fact that the sales activity

3

of Trinova to purchasers in Michigan, presumably

4

automobile companies, is going to bring in a great deal of

5

revenue to Trinova, is it not?

Sales activity will derive

revenue, that's right, Your Honor.

income is another point.

gross receipts, but it has not elected to do here.

But

The total value of the business

divided by those -- those three factors.
MR. SHELDON:

Well, if you define the total

17

value of the business in terms of value added principles,

18

like Michigan has done here, most of the tax base is going

19

to be compensation, and that three-factor formula will

20

inevitably cause gross distortion, because the sales

21

factor -- the reason that is so is because the sales

22

factor provides absolutely no clue whatsoever as to where

23

the dominant site-specific productive activity that

24

underlies payments of compensation and depreciation, which

25

are the lion's share of the tax base, take place.

MR. SHELDON:

The components of tax base -- what

12

we are taxing here is we are taxing productive activity

13

that is undertaken by the taxpayer, and the tax itself

14

defines productive activity in terms of labor costs, in

15

terms of capital costs, and to a very much lesser extent

16

in terms of profit.

17

then it is saying now, what is Michigan's fair share of

18

this total value-adding productive activity that the

19

taxpayer is undertaking?

measure that by using an apportionment formula that is

21

widely used to apportion income under an income tax act.

That is what is being taxed.

But they say

it should only be apportioned by a two-factor formula.

But as I noted before, and as explained on page 44 of the

exactly the same amount of tax whether or not there was

14

MR. SHELDON:

Thank you, Your Honor, I do.

15

Just because a business is a unitary business

16

does not mean that the tax bases of every tax to which it

17

may be subject must be apportioned.

18

will argue that a real property tax, or a tax on immobile

19

tangible personal property, or a severance tax that is

20

imposed against a business has to be apportioned just

21

because the business is a unitary business.

22

I don't think anyone

Here the practical effect of this tax is not a

23

tax on business activity.

That is merely the legal

24

justification, the legal excuse, if you will, for Michigan

25

are conducting business in the State.

The practical

2

effect of the tax is that for most taxpayers it is a tax

3

on compensation, and a tax on compensation is like a tax

4

on payroll.

5

no different than a tax on real property, or on immobile

tangible personal property, or a severance tax.

those taxes, it too should not be subjected to

apportionment.

And a tax on payroll is, in practical effect,

And like

You need not apportion it.

Amerada Hess, the point is made that this Court

10

said in Amerada Hess that the cost of unitary business and

whether those costs are or are not site specific is

12

irrelevant in determining their contribution to an income

tax base.

a taxing statute that was clearly an income tax.

15

wasn't even close to what the Michigan SBT is.

16

you denied the deduction for the windfall profit tax

17

deduction, what was left of the New Jersey tax was plainly

18

an income tax measured by Federal taxable income with just

19

the one deduct taken away for windfall profit tax.

20

But Amerada Hess involved a New Jersey statute,

Even after

Here we have a value-added tax where 90 percent

of the tax base, over 90 percent consists of site-specific

components, principally compensation.

Amerada Hess does not stand for the proposition that site-

24

specific components of a value-added tax base have to be

25

apportioned, or that their site specificity is irrelevant.

year, and the SBT as applied to it exacted a tax that

4

amounted to 3/10 of 1 percent of its sales.

in practical effect we're not talking about a gross

14

the only way, the only way Michigan can exact 1 cent of
