MR. LUCK:

We'll hear next in

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

propose three scenarios that support McNeil's proposed

16

rule that a defendant who requests or appears with counsel

17

at an initial appearance may not be questioned by police

18

while he remains in continuance custody unless the

19

defendant initiates that interrogation.

20

I would like to outline them briefly and then

The defendant was taken into custody on May

21

13th, 1987 in Omaha.

That was pursuant to a Milwaukee,

Wisconsin warrant and complaint for an armed robbery which

Milwaukee deputy sheriff detectives.
At the time that they took him into custody,

2
3

they advised him of his Miranda rights from a written text

4

which is used by the sheriff's department — that's in the

5

appendix.

represent you at public expense before or during any

8

questioning if you so choose.

And one of the rights read to him was if you

McNeil refused to make a statement at that time

9
10

and did not request counsel.

He was accompanied by

11

officers that day in a search of Omaha for a codefendant

12

which was unsuccessful.

13

transferred to the Omaha Airport for conveyance back to

14

Milwaukee,.

15

Smukowski of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department advised

16

McNeil that it would be to his advantage if he would tell

17

his side of the story referring to the armed robbery and

18

to a homicide investigation which was taking place

19

involving a Milwaukee County Sheriff by the name of Butts

20

and the Caledonia Police Department, which is part of

21

Racine County, a separate jurisdiction from Milwaukee

22

County.

On May 21st, McNeil was

During that transportation, Detective

23

Smukowski, after advising McNeil that it would

24

be in his interest to cooperate and tell his side of the

25

stories, was met by a silence from the part of McNeil.

He

1

did not make any statements concerning either of those

2

offenses.

3

McNeil was returned to Milwaukee on the evening

4

of the 21st.

The following morning, May 22nd, which was a

5

Friday, he was brought before a court commissioner, a

6

judicial officer, and with him at that time was a public

7

defender.

8

he was advised of the penalties for armed robbery.

9

acknowledged it by saying, I do, when he was asked if he

When McNeil appeared at the initial appearance,
He

10

understood, and those are the only words he spoke at that

11

initial appearance.

12
13
14
15

Bail was set at $25,000 and a preliminary
examination was set.
QUESTION:

That's the appearance of May 22nd

that's set forth in the — joint appendix at page 8?

16

MR. LUCK:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.

17

QUESTION:

Is it — is it the practice in this

18

State for magistrates to advise suspects generally of

19

their rights?

20

I see that wasn't done here.

MR. LUCK:

No, unfortunately, because of the

21

crush of cases in Milwaukee County, sometimes the niceties

22

of informing defendants of their full panoply of rights,

23

which they might get from a Federal magistrate, do not

24

take place.

25

QUESTION:

Is there any requirement in the

1

Wisconsin statute

2

MR. LUCK:

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

— that this be done by the

4

arraigning officer?

5

QUESTION:

There are requirements.

But one of

6

the requirements does not include — I ought to rephrase

7

that — the magistrate is not required to advise the

8

defendant of his right to remain silent at that initial

9

appearance, unlike under Rule 5 in the Federal system.

10

The magistrate is suppose to advise the defendant of the

11

charges against him, of his right to counsel, to set bail,

12

his right to a preliminary examination.

13

And if you will look at the text of that initial

14

appearance, you'll notice that there's really a colloquy

15

that goes on between defense counsel and the magistrate

16

and the only participation of the defendant is to

17

acknowledge what he has been charged with.

18

that a little further, Your Honor, the public defender has

19

a meeting with the defendants in Milwaukee County prior to

20

their appearance — at the initial appearance, albeit a

21

perfunctory meeting in a small room off to the side.

22

we can presume that that occurred before the appearance

23

before the magistrate.

continuously until that evening at 7:55 p.m. when

2

Detective Butts of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department went

3

to see McNeil for the purposes of interrogating him about

4

the armed robbery, and according to his testimony,

5

possibly the homicide.

6

had been involved in a homicide investigation from another

7

jurisdiction, that is, Racine County, because he had

8

informants apparently that led him to believe that McNeil

9

was involved in that Racine homicide.

10

Keep in mind that Detective Butts

As a result, Detective Butts was in

11

communication with police authorities from Racine County

12

concerning that homicide.

13

that evening at 7:55 p.m. at the Milwaukee County jail, I

14

think they can say to a certainty that he went there to

15

speak to him about the armed robbery and the homicide.

16

So when he went to see McNeil

When he arrived, he again read from the standard

17

Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department text concerning

18

Miranda rights, which is in the appendix.

19

McNeil signed a waiver of his rights and said to Butts, I

20

suppose you want to talk about that thing in Caledonia.

21

And of course, Butts said yes, and they had a conversation

22

about the Caledonia homicide.

24

totally exculpatory.

and that he would return.

Sunday in the early evening hours with a representative of

the Caledonia Department who had primary jurisdiction of

Department.

Consequent — or subsequent to that, Racine

County issued a homicide warrant on May 27th and Mr.

9

McNeil was transferred from the Milwaukee facility to

10

Racine, where he was subsequently arraigned, and

11

subsequently, after various motions to suppress the

12

statements which I've alluded to were denied, he entered

13

pleas to charges of second-degree murder, attempted

14

murder, and armed burglary.

15

After that, motions were brought to bring to the

16

trial court's attention the Seventh Circuit case of

17

Espinoza v. Fairman, which I don't think it's necessary

18

for me to go into facts, except to say that there's a

19

tremendous similarity between the two fact situations.

20

And at that time, Fairman held that the kinds of

21

statements that had been developed in McNeil should have

22

been suppressed.

case had been brought to its attention during the pending

case, it would have had the — it would have made the same

25

decision that the statements needn't have been suppressed.

The trial court felt that even if that

The case was then appealed to the intermediate

1
2

appeals level in Wisconsin, which certified to the

3

Wisconsin Supreme Court, because they felt there was no

4

applicable Wisconsin law.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court, after full briefing

5
6

and oral argument, felt that when McNeil appeared at the

7

initial appearance, it was purely a Sixth Amendment right

8

to counsel that he had invoked when he appeared with

9

counsel.

They use the word transmutation, and they say

10

that it is not possible to transmutate the Sixth Amendment

11

into the Fifth Amendment.

12

felt that there was no interrogation taking place at the

13

initial appearance, and in the absence of interrogation,

14

you cannot invoke your Fifth Amendment right.

15

And the reasoning was that they

Your Honor, we believe that there's three

16

scenarios that support the rule that we're proposing.

The

17

first is, if Mr. McNeil, when he was confronted by the

18

Milwaukee sheriffs in Omaha on May 20th, 1987, had, after

19

being advised of his rights, said, I want an attorney, I

20

don't think we'd be here today.

21

the United States would agree under the Edwards and the

22

Roberson doctrines.

And I think the State and

23

A second scenario is when the police from

24

Milwaukee approached Mr. McNeil, if he, sui sponte,

25

rights, had said, I want an attorney, I don't think we

2

would be here today.

3

QUESTION:

None of those -- neither of those

4

scenarios happened, did they?

5

MR. LUCK:

Absolutely not, Judge, they did not.

6

What did happen was an invocation of right to counsel with

7

a variation in time and a variation in place.

8

difference is, is that McNeil waited until he was in

9

Milwaukee to have counsel and it took place at an initial

The

10

appearance.

11

around the Edwards-Roberson doctrine as amplified by

12

Michigan v. Jackson.

13

And we have built our case, Your Honor,

There is a footnote which appears in our briefs,

14

footnote 7, where in Jackson this Court said that jurists

15

may understand the subtle distinctions between the Fifth

16

and Sixth Amendment, but when an average person invokes

17

his right to counsel, he does not know which

18

constitutional right his invocation rests upon.

19

knows when he invokes his right to counsel, whether it's

20

in front of a magistrate or a police officer, is that he

21

needs the assistance of counsel to stand between him and

22

his adversaries, be they the prosecutor or the police.

23

So that's —

I want an

attorney; but I'm pleased to talk with you now.
MR. LUCK:

2

Well, I think that if — if we take

3

Connecticut v. Barrett, which really doesn't amplify

4

it — restates the rule in Jackson that the request for

5

counsel should be given a broad rather than a narrow

6

interpretation and that it -- that if there's a plain

meaning to the defendant's innovation, we don't have to

move to that type of interpretation.

Therefore, as in

10

you an oral statement, but I want a counsel for a written

12

We don't have to interpret that.
So if a suspect says, I want an attorney, but I

13
14

want to talk to you, the plain meaning there would be, I

15

want to talk to you.

16

think you have to stop right there, because you have to

give it its broadest interpretation.

But if said, I want an attorney, I

Honor.

Well, the principle is that the mere

request for or invocation of right to counsel is not in

all respects tantamount to an exercise of your Fifth

Amendment rights.

Now, the State of Wisconsin has argued that the

plain meaning of an appearance with a defendant at an

12

initial appearance is that it's the Sixth Amendment.

Jackson says that that's not so clear.

MR. LUCK:

1

No, the record is silent on that.

And that's where we see the ambiguity.

has suggested that they agree with us that an individual

4

can invoke his right to Miranda in a noncustodial — I'm

5

sorry — in a noninterrogation setting much as this Court

said in — I believe it was the Chief Justice who wrote

8

that you can invoke that right in a noninterrogation

9

setting.

They simply say that McNeil didn't do it.

And

10

we're saying that they're disregarding the principle in

11

Jackson that when a person appears before a magistrate and

invokes his right to counsel, he doesn't know whether it's

the Fifth or Sixth Amendment.

give a broad interpretation to the immediate situation.

ambiguity.

colloquy between the magistrate and the defendant.

somewhere in between that.

Before I proceed to the argument that I prepared

1
2

to present this morning, I think I want to clear up one

3

thing with respect to our position.

4

our position would forbid an invocation of the Fifth

5

Amendment right to counsel which would thereby trigger the

6

Edwards rule at a court appearance on a charged defense.

Mr. Luck asserts that

I think that mischaracterizes our position.

7
8

in making that characterization of our position, he

9

attempts to drive a wedge between our position and the

And

10

position of the Solicitor General appearing on behalf of

11

the United States.
Our position, I think, and the Solicitor

12

13

General's position really — those two positions are

14

identical.

15

an appearance with an attorney at a hearing on a charged

16

offense, he does not thereby or as I think is stated in

17

the brief of the Solicitor General, he does not by that

18

fact alone invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel so

19

as to trigger the Edwards rule.

20

All we're saying is that if a defendant makes

We are not suggesting that a defendant could

21

not, if he clearly stated, I am not comfortable in dealing

22

with the police in a custodial interrogation situation,

23

and I want an attorney present whenever I am

24

interrogated — we're not suggesting that that kind of a

25

request could not come at any stage of his being in

QUESTION:

And I suppose his lawyer who is with

counsel at any other time the police may want to

And he says, yes.

Would that be enough?

I suppose he could do that.

13

But I suppose that could

I think there might still remain a question as

14

to whether or not that would invoke the protection of

15

Edwards, because I'm not so sure — I'm not so sure that

16

that really sends the message that needs to be sent to

17

trigger the Edwards rule.

18

to be sent is a message from the defendant himself.

19

knowing that what he is about to be subjected to what this

20

Court has characterized as the inherently coercive

21

pressures of custodial interrogation, he does not feel

22

comfortable in dealing with the police singlehandedly in

23

that situation.

You're saying to me that if the lawyer said to him, would

2

you feel comfortable without a lawyer if you have an

interrogation in custody, and he answered yes -- or he

answered no — that wouldn't do it?

Well, I guess I wouldn't go that

I don't see that situation arising.

9

He can't — he can't

I would assume if we decide the case

your way, public defenders will routinely, when they make

10

a public appearance like that, ask their clients that very

11

question.

12

MR. BECKER:

13

QUESTION:

Well, I -I think that's really what's at stake

14

in this case is to — what procedure will lawyers follow

15

in the future at procedures such as this?

16

MR. BECKER:

Well, I'm not so sure, because I'm

17

not so sure that a defense attorney sees his — or a

18

public defender or a private attorney who is representing

19

a person on a specific charged offense sees his job as

20

extending beyond the representation in that charged

21

defense to protecting his client in any other situations

22

to which he —

23

QUESTION:

Well, do you suppose this public

24

defender, if they started to question him on the second

25

offense, he said can I call a lawyer and ask him?

He

called up that public defender, and he said, I'm only-

MR. BECKER:

That may well — that may well be,

5

because I'm not so sure that the public defender has any

obligation to be providing — or perhaps even any right to

be providing — representation absent the filing of the

charges.

The public defender's representation is to

10

Well, then, if that's the case, it

11

shouldn't really matter — oh, I see what you're saying.

12

All right, I see the point.

13

MR. BECKER:

I think the obligation that we're

14

trying to fulfill with our public defender system is the

15

16

Sixth Amendment.

17

counsel in that interrogation that you've just described.

18

And there is no Sixth Amendment right to

QUESTION:

Well, but you've just -- if the

19

defendant himself appears and he said, by the way, Judge,

20

I want everybody to know that I don't want the police

21

interrogating me about anything in the future without my

22

having a lawyer.

23

lawyer's question, but he just — he's — he's been there

24

before, so he — he knows he should say it, and he says

25

it.

He didn't say that in response to the

1

MR. BECKER:

Well, I don't know that he knows

2

that he should say it.

3

that it that happened that that would have to be — that

4

would be an invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BECKER:

I think I would have to concede

You didn't say Fifth Amendment.
Well, no, I realize that.

But if

7

he says that I'm uncomfortable with custodian

8

interrogation about any crime and I'm not just concerned

9

about this crime that I'm appearing before you on.

10

This -- as a practical matter though that doesn't occur.

11

I mean defendants now know that they have — many

12

defendants know that they have right to silence and rights

13

to counsel, but they aren't standing up at court

14

appearances and invoking those rights, because they know

15

the appropriate place to invoke those rights is when

16

the -- when the situation requires it; i.e., when the

17

police administer the Miranda warnings in anticipation of

18

beginning interrogation.

19

QUESTION:

But you don't suppose that if you

20

follow your rule I have to back off the notion of

21

questioning.

22

would be in your best interest to make this statement to

23

the court during the hearing, and then they go ahead and

24

make the statement.

25

rather frequently in the future if we adopt your rule?

But the lawyer might not advise him that it

MR. BECKER:

2

QUESTION:

I
— or do you think counsel will

3

probably figure that's ultra vires, so you never give the

4

defendant that advice?
MR. BECKER:

5

I think that and I also really have

6

a serious question whether or not — if that were to turn

7

out to be the practice — whether this Court could really

8

feel that that ought to be the kind of request for an

9

attorney's representation at custodial

10

interrogation — that that ought to be the kind of request

11

that triggers the Edwards rule.

12

As I indicated earlier, it seems to me that what

13

we really — what really ought to trigger Edwards and what

14

the record really ought to clearly show is that a

15

defendant basically on his own has come to that

16

conclusion.

17

defense counsel really raises the kind of concerns —

18

I don't know that a defendant prompted by

19

you probably are not competent to deal with the police on

your own.

21

MR. BECKER:

Well, but that's advice that is I

22

think contrary to I think what -- what underpins Miranda

23

and Edwards and all the rest, and that is that the

defendant generally is competent to deal with the police

on his own and to make that decision as to whether or not

he can handle custodial interrogation without an attorney

2

present or whether or not he does feel those inherently

3

coercive pressures that the Court talked about in Miranda

4

and has talked about in every Miranda decision since —

5

QUESTION:

Well, the end -- the end result of

6

your argument is — is that if the — I think you can see

7

that the magistrate here didn't go through the full

panoply of what usually is gone through.

9

MR. BECKER:

Well, he went through the full

10

panoply of what usually goes through — what is usually

11

gone through in Wisconsin, because all that Wisconsin

12

basically requires is what went on here, and that is that

13

the judge has informed the defendant of the charge — of

14

his right to counsel.

15

he had counsel.

16
17

QUESTION:

He didn't have to do that, because

All right -- all right, he'd be

MR. BECKER:

Sure.
And the fellow says, and by the way,

20

I certainly want counsel and I don't want to be

interrogated about anything without counsel being present.

will be true with respect to this charge.

But I have no

I would

think that's the -- that's exactly what you have to be

No, I — what I'm arguing is that,

number one, the scenario that you paint I don't think is

it now.

I don't know why we should see it after this case

arises.

A defendant is fully capable of exercising that

right when the time comes to exercise it; i.e., when the

police begin their questioning.

I mean we don't see

So I don't think it's going to —

my question.

Suppose the judge says that?

MR. BECKER:

13

I don't think that is going to answer

No, I don't think a judge is going

14

to say that, because I think perhaps in that situation

15

where a defendant not coached by an attorney but truly

16

because he feels that he's incapable of dealing with

custodial interrogation without an attorney makes that

assertion in the context of a court hearing, I think that

context of a court appearance, that the — and — and when

that request for counsel then is going to bar

that what this Court has to do is basically a cost-benefit

analysis.

against the benefits that you really will find a

8

persuasive case made for the extension that is being

sought.

And I don't think that once you weigh the costs

not arrive on the scene quite as quickly as he does in

Wisconsin, where you'll have a court making inquiry at

initial appearance as to the defendant's wishes with

11

regard to counsel which will, in the normal course, it

12

would seem to me, invoke a request for counsel.

13

And so, as a practical matter as I indicated,

14

what you're going to be doing is you're going to be saying

that as soon as a defendant is charged with a crime, he is

going to become off limits for police-initiated

And when I say

Well, I think we all know — I think common

11

sense and -- and experience teach — teach us that as

12

Justice Kennedy pointed out in his dissent in Roberson, it

13

is not a rare situation that a defendant charged with one

14

offense is a suspect with regard to other offenses.

15

And if you need some kind of empirical data to

support that, I would suggest that you go and read — if

you haven't done so already — the brief amicus filed by

the Illinois Attorney General's office.

QUESTION:

I suppose you could always' get around

the rule sought by the defendant here if you — you just

him on the more serious one.

away on that one, too, wouldn't he?

7

MR. BECKER:

Well, he'd get counsel right

Well, not necessarily if you — if

you arrested him for purposes of interrogation and

didn't — didn't bring him before the court.

10
11

You'd have

QUESTION:

Of course, in this very case, as I

12

remember the facts, they were already investigating him on

the second crime.

15

can interrogate him more effectively on the second crime,

16

then it's advantageous for law enforcement purposes to be

able to do that without having to notify counsel.

18

what they do, as I understand it.

19

less serious offense, bring him into custody, and then you

20

want to question him on the more serious offense which was

under investigation at the time of the first arrest.

why they certainly couldn't interrogate him if he didn't

2

want to be interrogated without — without probable cause

to arrest him.

4

MR. BECKER:

That's true.

That's true.

I mean

5

they'd have — they'd have to have probable cause to

6

arrest him on that second offense, and which he may be

7

nothing more than a suspect which of course raises the

8

whole problem of whether or not it's not in the

9

defendant's interest perhaps to have — to be questioned

10

about these other crimes that he's suspected of, because

11

he may be able to clear himself of all suspicion.

12

The — the situation in that regard, by the way,

13

that a — that a suspect charged with one offense may well

turn out to be a -- a person charged with one offense may

15

turn out to be a suspect in other offenses, I think has

only become exacerbated as we see the -- with the advent

17

of these computerized fingerprint matching systems which I

18

think are going to result in even more cases in — in

19

which we are able to, as a result of arrest on one charge

20

and — and bringing him to — and bringing those charges

21

before the court, we are going to find out that this

22

fellow may have been involved in other activity about

Now, that interference might be tolerable if

I think the apparent concern of this Court — it

was certainly the concern that Justice Kennedy identified

as the apparent concern of this Court in his dissent in

Roberson -- is that if you -- if you go ahead an

19

attorney — and we're talking about a situation in Edwards

20

where he requested an attorney during the course of

21

custodial interrogation — if you go ahead and reinitiate

really have a right to counsel?

this right.

Why are they

I don't think that describes how a defendant

would view the situation when he has appeared in court

he perceives that as being inconsistent with what happened

offense.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue here is — is we believe is more

4

narrow than some of the discussion has indicated.

It is

5

whether anything that happened in petitioner's first

6

appearance — a first appearance that is fairly typical of

7

proceedings that occur many, many times each day around

8

the United States -- is fairly regarded as a basis for

9

triggering Edwards no-waiver presumption.

We submit that

10

there is no basis for the triggering of Edwards in this

11

situation for two basic reasons.

12

First, applying a presumption that an otherwise

13

valid waiver of Miranda rights is a product of coercion is

14

not necessary in this situation to protect the

15

individual's free exercise of his privilege against

16

compelled self-incrimination.

17

purpose of all the Miranda rules.

18

And that after all is the

Secondly, that sort of a rule would needlessly

19

undercut the other interest which factors into the Miranda

20

complex and that is the public's interest in the effective

21

investigation of — of crimes.

QUESTION:

that advice?

Or would the case be just the same?

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

I'm not sure I understand,

because the difficulty is that the magistrate follows the

He says,

5

it's important to limit the Edwards rules to those

No, I — I believe, Your

Honor, that thus far this Court has restricted the Edwards

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY M. LUCK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LUCK:

of Wisconsin it seems to petitioner, disregard of one of

21

the fundamental purposes of Miranda, which is to deal with

22

the question of custody and the resulting coercive

23

atmosphere that results from custody when it's put in the

24

interrogation setting, and which this Court most recently

25

recognized in Minnick.

The fact of the matter is that once the

defendant is arraigned or appears at an initial appearance

and has bail set and he's indigent — and for all

practical purposes, McNeil was never going to make bail.

He was indigent and he had $25,000 bond.

to think that the — the continued custody doesn't work on

It's unrealistic

individuals who have been charged who could be

interrogated in the jail because they've committed other

offenses, think of all those individuals who were in the

cannot be questioned any further.

8

statistics are, but we know it's a pyramid and the number

9

of people who are taken into custody are not equal to the

If they talk about the number of

I don't know what the

10

number of people who appear in court and they have bail

12

I think it's also unrealistic to say that

13

individuals want an opportunity to explain to the police

14

when they're sitting in a jail cell about how they weren't

15

involved in a particular offense.

16

is is that this Court has recognized that counsel is

17

needed in the custodial setting as a guiding hand to

18

assist individuals, to enable them to decide whether or

19

not they want to respond to questioning.

The fact of the matter
