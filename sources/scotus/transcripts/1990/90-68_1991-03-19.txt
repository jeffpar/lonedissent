ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD K. THOMPSON, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. THOMPSON:

10

please the Court:
The United States court of appeals for the Ninth

11
12

Circuit held in this case that footnote dictum —

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Would you speak up a little, Mr.

Thompson?

15

MR. THOMPSON:

I'm sorry.

That footnote dictum

16

in Harris against Reed compels a Federal court to presume

17

that by summarily denying a successive State habeas corpus

18

petition the California Supreme Court intentionally waived

19

a procedural default that the State court of appeal had

20

expressly claimed 10 years earlier.

Nunnemaker was convicted of first degree murder.

grounds.

QUESTION:

The State trial

These were petitions for habeas

corpus?

10

MR. THOMPSON:

11

At that point, Mr. Nunnemaker then turned to the

Yes, Your Honor.

12

Federal district court, which ultimately denied his

13

Federal habeas corpus petition on the grounds that he had

14

in fact waived — procedurally defaulted his Miranda

15

claim.

16

He then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.
While that appeal was pending this Court

17

announced its decision in Harris v. Reed, which became the

18

basis for the decision below, reached without the benefit

19

of argument or — either briefing or oral argument on this

20

Court's intervening decision.

21

It was in the context of divining the unspoken

22

intent underlying a 7-page State court opinion that in

23

Harris against Reed the Court held that a procedural

24

default would not bar consideration of a Federal claim

25

either on direct or Federal habeas review unless the last

1

State court rendering judgment clearly and expressly

2

stated that its decision rested on a State procedural bar.

3

So the holding of Harris appeared to apply only

4

when it was unclear whether in fact the last State court

5

to write an opinion had invoked a State procedural rule.

6

And in Harris the last State court wrote an opinion, an

7

opinion expressly deciding the Federal question, but no

8

State court in Harris clearly claimed a procedural

9

default.
By contrast, in Nunnemaker a State court did

10
11

claim clearly, in fact exclusively as a basis for its

12

decision, a State procedural bar.

13

addressed the Federal question, and the last State court

14

did not write an opinion.

15

QUESTION:

No State court

Nevertheless —

Mr.' Thompson, as I understand the

16

ruling of the court of appeal, it was based on the

17

proposition that the Supreme Court of California, which

18

denied a writ of habeas corpus without opinion in this

19

case, does on occasion grant review of otherwise defaulted

20

claims where there's an original petition for habeas

21

corpus.

22

writ is based on procedural grounds.

23

And so you can't say flatly that a denial of the

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, Your Honor, the Ninth

24

Circuit's opinion quotes your opinion and says that the

25

Supreme Court in Harris discussed the issue now before us.

Now, on its face the Ninth Circuit seems to say
that Harris disposes of this case.

And I think that that

10

view is reinforced by the fact that the Ninth Circuit

11

unnecessarily raised the question as to whether or not a

12

petition for review, not — that is addressed to the State

13

supreme court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction in a

14

habeas corpus case, if it were summarily denied might not

In this case, however, California simply asked

13

that the Federal court correctly interpret California law,

14

and that once that is done that that interpretation will

15

inform all Federal subsequent litigation.

16

Now, it may be that the Ninth Circuit's reading

17

of Harris was reinforced by its longstanding

18

misapprehension of California law, namely that the

19

California Supreme Court's habeas jurisdiction, because it

is original, must be mandatory.

I understand.

But you think we would have

MR. THOMPSON:

No, I think what you would have

11

which could be challenged —

MR. THOMPSON:

And in one case it's the

Well, I think what would happen

17

is you would have to conclude that you should deny cert.

18

because there was no judgment on the merits.

19

Now, the Court could choose, I suppose, by

20

analogy to its practice on direct review, to look through

21

the State supreme court's habeas denial until you got a

22

decision.

23

the rule 260(e) of the California Rules of Court requires

24

a trial court when it denies a habeas petition to state

25

brief reasons for its denial.

Now you should get one even on habeas, because

1

In this case you could look through to the court

2

of appeals opinion and reach the merits.

I am not sure

3

that the Court would wish to do that, because what it

4

would do in practice is to result in allowing the

5

petitioner to renew his petition for cert, annually or

6

even more frequently because he could always file a

7

petition for habeas in California criticizing or

8

challenging on Federal grounds a decision rendered by a

9

court of appeal or even the supreme court years earlier,

10

and then if the subsequent habeas were reviewable then you

11

would get to review that cert, petition at least once or

12

twice a year.

13

Now you might wish not to do that and say

14

the fact that this is a petition invoking the California

discretion to forgive that procedural default.

at least five cases right now where the California Supreme

district judge as a matter of Federal law decide there was

a waiver of the claim?

MS. DROUS:

Yeah, the -- this rule is not

Could he say I don't think I even have to reach the merits

because it's so clear to me that this argument was waived

by the failure to make an objection in the trial court?

If there is cause and prejudice he can go ahead with

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

Your Honor, the district court did not send Mr.

20

Nunnemaker back to the State courts because it could not
