CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 89-1217, James Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty.

5

Let's try to move along, Mr. Kneedler.

Mr. LaJeunesse, you may proceed whenever you're

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND J. LaJEUNESSE, JR.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

12

MR. LEHNERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Professor Jim Lehnert and his fellow petitioners

13

in 1981-82 were nonunion faculty members at Ferris State

14

College, a 4-year institution of higher education in the

15

State- of Michigan.

16

pay as a condition of their employment a service fee to

17

their exclusive bargaining representative, the Ferris

18

Faculty Association.

19

Merritt of the court of appeals vigorously dissenting as

20

to all but one activity, held that Professor Lehnert and

21

his colleagues' First Amendment rights were not violated

22

when those service fees were used for certain activities

23

of the association and at State and national affiliates,

24

the Michigan and National Education Associations.

25

They were compelled by the college to

1

First, may Professor Lehnert and his colleagues be

2

required to subsidize financially activities which are not

3

conducted on behalf of their bargaining unit but on behalf

4

of individuals elsewhere in other bargaining units in

5

Michigan and in other States, on behalf of employees who

6

are not faculty members in higher education but teachers

7

in kindergarten through 12th grade, educational support

8

personnel, or nurses.

9

The second major issue is whether Professor

10

Lehnert and his nonunion colleagues can be required to

11

support financially political and ideological activities

12

that are not part of the bargaining process anywhere.

13

What activities are we talking about?

Most of

14

the activities at issue on "this appeal both do not concern

15

the Ferris bargaining unit and are not integral to the

16

bargaining process anywhere.

17

primary expenditures at issue are the costs of millage

18

campaigns to increase millage property taxes and lobbying

19

against State legislation that would have provided

20

property tax relief.

21

For example, two of the

Ferris State College receives not 1 cent from

22

millages or from property taxes, so therefore, Ferris

23

State College was not affected by these activities at all.

24

The only effect on Professor Lehnert and his colleagues

25

was as competitors for scarce public resources, and if

1

they lived in the district where the taxes were raised,

2

their taxes went up.

They're affected as taxpayers.

3

Another example of an issue or an activity in

4

this category was the study that the National Education

5

Association conducted of school finance in Arizona.

6

had to be a political and ideological activity and it

7

wasn't related to Ferris State College because Arizona did

8

not even permit collective bargaining for educational

9

employees at the time in question.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Why do you say it had to be a

political or ideological activity?
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

It could not be part of the

13

political bargaining process in Arizona, because

14

bargaining was prohibited by the State of Arizona for

15

educational employees.

16

QUESTION:

Well, so, you define any political

17

and ideological as meaning any activity that does not

18

accrue to the benefit of the bargaining unit?

19

That

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

No, Your Honor, political and

20

ideological is any public advocacy or dealing with

21

Government outside the bargaining process, petitioning of

22

government speech and association.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, I thought this was just a study

out in Arizona?
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

It was a study of school

i

finance, and school finance in Arizona was accomplished

2

only through legislation, not through bargaining.
QUESTION:

3

Well, I would think your argument

4

would be, not that that was political or ideological, but

5

since it didn't benefit the members of the bargaining unit

6

it was no good.

7

things —

8
9
10

11

I would think there's a category of

MR. LaJEUNESSE:
that it's both.

Our argument, Your Honor, is

It neither concerned this bargaining unit

nor was it part of the bargaining process anywhere.
QUESTION:

But if, if one sets out to do a

12

neutral study that just doesn't have much to do with what

13

the person is at, I would not think that's political or

14

ideological.

15

something that is, is not perhaps germane to the

16

bargaining process.

17

I think it's more better defined as

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Your Honor, I think it related

18

to the question of taxes and educational appropriations in

19

the State of Arizona as well as being outside the

20

bargaining unit in this case.

21

QUESTION:

May I, may I just ask you a little

22

more about this millage point?

23

for the national union sought more money for faculty

24

salaries in colleges.

25

or just wanted more appropriations to expand the faculties

and new curricula and so forth.

2

permissible or impermissible?

3

MR. LaJEUNESSEs

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Would you say that was

Impermissible, Your Honor.

Because it's —
It's outside the bargaining

6

process.

7

First Amendment as equally as the support of candidates

8

for public office, as this Court said in Meyer v. Grant.

9

It's an activity which is at the core of the

QUESTION:

So, so you really don't rely

10

particularly on the fact that the millage happened to be

11

for grammar schools and so forth rather than colleges?

12

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

13

that there's a bright-line test —

14

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I'm saying

I mean, your argument — let me put

15

this way.

Your argument on that point is much like your

16

argument on anything outside the bargaining unit is

17

impermissible.

18

national organization and the like.

19

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I mean, you know, conventions and for the

Your Honor, I think there's a

20

bright-line test.

There are two standards which this

21

Court has consistently applied and which in fact are the

22

-- based on a statute, and that is if an activity is

23

either outside the bargaining process or does not concern

24

the bargaining unit then it's not within the governmental

25

interest that this Court has found to underlie a

2

constitutional agency shop.
The governmental interest which this Court found

3

to underlie a constitutional agency shop in Abood, which

4

involved the same statute that's at issue here, are the

5

same interests that the Court has found with regard to the

6

Federal labor statutes in the cases from Hanson through

7

Beck and that is to advance labor peace within the

8

bargaining units by having one bargaining agent to make —

9

make and enforce a single contract for the employees in

10

that unit to prevent the conflict which would arise if you

11

had more than one representative trying to represent the

12

employees in the same unit.

13

And secondly to avoid the risk of the free

14

rider, the employee who doesn't join the union and is not

15

paying his pro rata share of the costs of the statutory

16

functions which the union as bargaining representative

17

performs for the employees in that bargaining unit in

18

making and enforcing the labor contract.

19
20
21

So both of those interests come back to that
dual bright-line test.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. LaJeunesse, I'm not sure

22

that Abood drew a so-called bright-line test for public

23

sector employees.

24

that multi-unit unions effectively strengthen the local

25

bargaining unit and that it's just like buying an

The argument made on the other side is

1

insurance policy and spreading the risk that those

2

expenses outside the bargaining unit can strengthen the

3

local unit as the need occurs locally.

4

that?

5

QUESTION:

How do you answer

Justice O'Connor, two answers.

6

First, the argument that the local is strengthened by the

7

activities elsewhere is the same argument the railway

8

clerks' union made in the Ellis case for organizing —

9

compelling support of organizing and compelling support of

10

litigation concerning bargaining — other bargaining

11

units, and the Court rejected it in Ellis.

12

established a standard which says that what is chargeable

13

is only those activities that are part of the performance

14

of the statutory functions of representing the employees,

15

in dealing with the employer on labor management issues.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Or germane -- not part of.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Germane — the definition of

germane under both law and —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

23
24
25

It

doesn't have to be part of, does it?

19

22

The Court

But anyway it has to be germane —
Germane is closely related,

Justice White.
QUESTION:

It has to be germane to the services

under the particular bargaining contract.
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

That's correct.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

3
4

And the particular unit.
Germane and closely related,

Your Honor.
And the second answer to Justice O'Connor's

5

question is that affiliation is not an insurance policy.

6

It's not a service contract.

7

enforceable contract between the local and the State and

8

national organizations which specifies as service

9

contracts do and as insurance policies do what services

10

There is no legally

will be provided, what specific services will be provided.

11

QUESTION:

If there were —

12

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

The contingencies —

— would it make a difference?
If — if you had a legally

15

enforceable contract spelling out the bargaining services

16

that had to be provided and when they had to be provided,

17

and you had the allocation necessary to separate — and

18

this is the second distinction between the service

19

contract and affiliation — if you had the necessary

20

recordkeeping to separate out the nonbargaining functions

21

of the union, then the answer might be that the costs

22

would be chargeable.

23

approved, actual costs that there was a basis in actual

24

costs for the charge.

25

But it would be costs that the union

\

1

with Street not that affiliation itself is a cost of

2

collective bargaining that can be charged, but that there

3

must be a breakdown of the services provided by the state

4

or national affiliate that can be charged to the

5

nonmembers.
QUESTION:

6

Going back to lobbying for a minute,

7

I suppose in the public sector if the union is out

8

lobbying to try to get increased health benefits, for

9

example, for public employees including those in the

10

bargaining unit or a tax increase to fund payment of

11

teachers' salaries Statewide that would affect those in

12

the bargaining unit as well.

13

chargeable?

14
15

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Now you say none of that is

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

don't —

16

QUESTION:

And why not?

17

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I -- because, number one, we're

18

dealing with an activity which the state has excluded from

20

political processes.

2

3

4

That's

The in — when you get outside that narrow,

5

special process which the State has set up for collective

6

bargaining, you're infringing on core First Amendment

7

rights, which this Court has said are the same as the

8

rights that exist with regard to the support of

9

candidates.
If — if you don't draw the line at the process,

10
11

what are the limits?

12

regard to a private sector labor union that when it

13

lobbies Congress for minimum wage legislation, that could

14

be chargeable.

15

Ellis and in Beck that can't be charged in the private

16

sector, and the Court has said in Abood and in Keller that

17

the First Amendment rights of public employees and private

18

employees are the same.

19

The same thing could be said with

slope.

And

1

I think we have to go back to the basic question of what

2

type of scrutiny this Court applies when we're dealing

3

with infringements on First Amendment rights.

4

has said that even requiring the employee to pay for the

5

costs of bargaining on his own behalf significantly

6

impacts on his First Amendment rights.

7

The Court

Here we're talking about making him pay for

8

bargaining on behalf of other employees.

Therefore, as to

9

him those aren't his terms and conditions of employment.

10

Those are matters of industrial relations and. in the

11

public sector, politics.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. — Mr. LaJeunesse, what if their

13

pending in the Michigan legislature a bill that would have

14

directed the 10-percent reduction in the appropriation for

15

all colleges like Ferris State College?

16

bargaining unit, the respondent here, could charge to the

17

agency shop people the — whatever costs they spent in

18

lobbying against that?

19

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Do you think the

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

20

so because it's outside the process.

It's still in the

21

normal political processes.

22

lobby on that, then why can't they lobby against an

23

increase in the budget for social welfare programs,

24

because if those increase the amount of money available

25

for education is decreased?

If you say that they can

don't think so.

I think that answer is clear under Abood

QUESTION:

That's

Mr. LaJeunesse, one category of

charges that you say were improper really is quite

different from the others in that you concede that they're

— that they're not part of the legislative process and

you can see that they do narrowly affect the particular

costs of preparing for an illegal strike which never

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I don't think the activity has

18

to be illegal for it to be not chargeable.

19

for an activity to be chargeable to the dissenting

interest.

— you don't want these bargaining

QUESTION:

15
16

Now

Well, I'm saying —

Or illegal to threaten an illegal

strike.
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

The Michigan Court of Appeals

17

and the Michigan Supreme Court have held in the Male case,

18

which we cite in the briefs, that it was against the

19

public policy of Michigan to require the nonmembers to

20

contribute to a fund, a strike fund, which would in the

21

future be used to fund strikes.

22

fund obviously threatens employers just as much as the

23

threats in this case, yet it was held to be against the

24

public interest of Michigan to require the nonmembers to

25

support that preparation for a strike which would be

And the existence of that

illegal under Michigan law.
And I would also add, Justice Scalia, that the

2

3

record directly contradicts — the record as to the — the

4

internal union documents which are in evidence, directly

5

contradict the testimony of the union witness who said

6

that this was merely a bargaining employee.

7

those documents which are cited in that part of our brief

8

you will see that, when they are talking to each other in

9

private, the union intended to go out on strike, that

If you read

10

those were real preparations for a real strike which just

11

happened not to occur.
QUESTION:

12

May I — may I — this — your asking

13

us to look at the testimony and so forth, brings to mind

14

this question.

15

of whether an activity is germane is a question of law or

16

a question of fact?

17

we have two courts who have wrestled with an awful lot of

18

detail.

19

recollection is incorrect, that with respect to the local

20

union, you — about 80 percent or something like that of

21

their activities were held okay to be charged, but as

22

respect to the Michigan union and the national unit,

23

something like 95 percent of those were held to be

24

impermissible.

25

Michigan and any — is that -- is my recollection right on

To what extent do you think the question

And the reason I ask that is I guess

And as I understand — now maybe -- maybe my

that?

2

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

But the question of what kind of activity, whether a

4

particular type of activity is a question of law.

5

fact, is a content-based regulation of speech, as the

6

Court said in Riley v. National Federation of the Blind,

7

when you are making a decision as to whether somebody

8

would be compelled to make a speech that they would not on

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

But this Court held in Abood —

Yeah.
— and in Elrod that requiring

those financial contributions which are then used to speak

20

on issues as to which the employee is in opposition is

21

tantamount to coerce belief.

fact that it was done through — through a contribution

each of these issues is a pure question of law in your

view?

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

That's correct.

Whether a

particular expenditure fits within one of the categories,

once the category are defined —

QUESTION:

Well, again, on this strike business,

7

I mean, a lot of the money was in a pot there that they

said might — might finance a strike and might finance

It's kind of mixed the little bit, the use

of that fund I think.

Well, and their bargaining position.
It was -- the only purpose of

having a separate strike headquarters instead of their

normal meeting place was to threaten the college with what

22

would be an illegal act had it occurred.

Was there any finding one way or the

24

other on whether they discussed informational picketing,

There was informational picketing that went on during this

directed at the general public.

And therefore, under this

MR. CHANIN:

That —

Their characterization —

fundamentally misstates the situation, and it totally

misses the point of union affiliation and its purpose.

Affiliation is essentially a pre-paid delivery service by

12

which larger parent organizations help its local

affiliates to carry out their representational

responsibilities, not in the sense that Justice O'Connor

affiliation is indeed a contract between parent

organizations and locals.

What

we have in essence done is taken the guidance that this

Court has given us in a slightly different context of how

you analyze out a union's budget.

11

about the parent organizations is we will discount out

those things that we really can charge for by looking at

of general litigation unless the local bargaining unit was

2

directly involved.

3

would lead one to conclude that that case was wrongly

decided.

It seems to me that your argument

MR. CHANIN:

5

No, Your Honor, not at all.

Let me

6

say about that holding in Ellis.

That was a statutory

7

holding.

8

activities in question were chargeable under the Railway

9

Labor Act, and only as to those activities that it found

The Court began by analyzing what of the

10

met the standard under the Railway Labor Act did it

11

address directly the constitutional issue.

12

The litigation

So what we have with litigation then is
basically a statutory holding.
QUESTION:

But —

Well, it was construed to RLA ever

16

since Hanson very much in the light of the constitutional

17

provisions, have we not?

18

MR. CHANIN:

Yes, you have, Your Honor.

And I

19

have no question but that Ellis in many respects sets the

20

basic test for First Amendment adjudication and indeed

21

this Court recognized this last term in Keller when it

22

applied it to a constitutional base.

23

as far as not the test, but the application of that test

24

to specific items, the Court only applied the

25

constitutional test to those items it had found chargeable

But in Ellis itself,

under the RLA and litigation of a general nature did not

2

make it.

3

But having answered it that way and attempted to

4

distinguish Ellis my answer to your question is yes.

5

Under — first of all, I believe litigation may have a

6

different meaning in the public sector in any event.

7

under our theory in which you are paying for the

8

availability of this service, I do believe the litigation

9

would be brought in.

But

Because it's not relevant whether

10

the specific activity in the resource pool of the parent

11

organizations is done on behalf of Ferris.

12

it is an activity in the generic sense that is germane to

13

collective bargaining.

14

QUESTION:

It is whether

But I'm really in doubt whether that

15

rationale can be squared with Ellis on the so-called

16

statutory ground.

17

beyond what the Court said there.

18

It seems to me to go substantially

MR. CHANIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.

But let me look at the other points of Ellis if I may.

20

What Ellis did, and I think the focus when we look at

21

Ellis should be on the three items that the Court did

22

indeed find chargeable under the Railway Labor Act and

23

clearly within the constitutional range as well.

The Petitioners contend in this case that this

multi-unit cost-sharing system violates their First

4

Amendment rights, and that they can only be required to

5

pay their share of the actual services delivered by the

6

parent organizations to them on a pay-as-you-go basis.

7

Whatever we have -- may have put in in a particular year

8

in dealing with their employer is all that they can pay.

9

Let me make clear here what the legal issue is.

10

The issue is not whether the type of pay-as-you-go

11

delivery system that the petitioners urge is

12

constitutional.

13

Constitution requires every bargaining unit to use that

14

system or whether the State of Michigan can

15

constitutionally conclude that it would like to reject

16

that system and that a cross unit, a risk-sharing type of

17

system as we have here fulfills or advances the State's

18

interest in labor peace and stability.

19

The question is rather whether the

Now, if in fact the petitioners simply paid for

the services that they received in a particular year, they

In Abood, this Court referred to some of the unique

those activities to effectively carry out our job.
QUESTION:

Well, yeah, but it's apparently

stipulated that millage has no direct effect on what

happens to the budget of the Ferris College.
MR. CHANIN:

6

Well, that's true, Your Honor, but

7

we do not attempt -- if I -- you have to interplay here

2

Now taking Justice Stevens' point, in fact if I

may because you mentioned that, Your Honor.

this Court stated that funding to -- lobbying to fund

chargeable expense and the petitioners concede that.

In Abood,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. LEHNERT:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

4

One of the questions Mr. Chanin was asked was

5

whether there is a contract which guarantees the services

6

to the local affiliate.

7

The affiliation agreements, the contract — the

8

constitutions of the Michigan Education Association and

9

National Education Association are in the record.

He didn't answer that question.

They

10

don't guarantee any services to this local, and in fact we

11

know there aren't services to this local even where -- a

12

guarantee of services — even in the years where there is

13

this crisis, this catastrophe that Mr. Chanin talks about.

14

QUESTION:

Well, certainly he suggested that it

15

was by custom if not by law.

16

difference if it were shown by custom they did all these

17

things even though perhaps they could not have been

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

You have

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

12

think that's the rule that this Court has laid down in the

13

cases all the way through Hudson, saying that the union

14

has to prove the chargeable cost.

15

QUESTION:

Do you, do you think the First

a contractual right to get that — you can pay out the

money and charge the nonunion members if you have

contractual right to get the assistance for it, but by

20

reason of the First Amendment you can't pay it out if it's

assistance.
