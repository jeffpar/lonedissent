MR. FARKAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

This case concerns in the first instance

a little more about remail than we said in our briefs.

think it might be helpful to decide both the issues

presented.

Mr. Larkin will go with the merits of the administrative

procedure.

I thought I might open up by saying

I will then discuss the standing issue, and

International remail involves the shipment in

Now let me turn to the standing issue.

operation of the restrictions on private carriage of

QUESTION:

Farkas.

Could you speak up a little bit, Mr.

I'm having a little trouble hearing.

10

you raised the lectern a little.

11

MR. FARKAS:

12
13

Perhaps if

In 1979 — can you hear me now?

Thank you, Your Honor.
In 1979, the United States Postal Service

14

suspended the restrictions on private carriage of letters

15

by — and that — those' laws — the restrictions on

16

private carriage of letters are referred to the postal

17

monopoly laws, also referred to in the briefs as the

18

private express statutes.

19

The 1979 suspension related to both domestic

20

urgent letters and international urgent letters.

21

after the suspension, the practice — the international

22

side of the urgent letter rule was used both to deliver

23

urgent letters to — individually to foreign addressees

24

and also to deliver international letters, urgent letters

25

in bulk, to foreign post offices.

Soon

In 1985 the United States Postal Service took

1

2

exception to the delivery of letters, urgent letters, to

3

foreign post offices and initiated a rule making to

4

prohibit that practice.

5

remailers themselves with the help of the administration

6

and members of Congress, participated in that rule making

7

and the — eventually the Postal Service turned around and

8

issued a rule-that said remail was okay.

The users of remail, the

It was lawful.

The American Postal Workers Union and the

9
10

National Association of Letter Carriers then sued the

11

Postal Service, saying that the suspension was improper

12

and therefore violated the postal monopoly laws.

13

alleged as their injury the possibility of losses of jobs,

14

postal employment jobs, and the district court found that

15

to meet the Article III injuring fact test but,dismissed

16

the case on the grounds that the postal employees were not

17

in the zone of interest of the postal monopoly laws.

certiorari.

merits of that issue.

3

In order to — under the zone of interest test,

4

in order to look at whether — one looks to the statute

5

and its legislative history to determine whether a party

6

asserting a violation of an act was the party who's

7

rightfully entitled to pursue that suit.

express statutes were originated in the late 19 — late

dismissed by the district court.

Therefore, we contend that the

1

The unions here have not seriously challenged —

2

in fact they appear to have abandoned the contention that

3

the private express statutes give them standing.

4

turn to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 as the

5

appropriate statute to look to for standing purposes for

6

zone of interest purposes.

7

They now

We believe that the Postal Reorganization Act

8

does not confer standing because it was no more a postal

employment act — it no more promoted postal employment --

10

Congress no more considered postal employment — that is,

11

in numbers — in promulgating that act —

12

QUESTION:

Is this, is this really an argument

13

or is it part of an argument that the statute doesn't

14

provide the private cause of action to anybody?

MR. FARKAS:

No, this is not a private cause of

action case.

on the — on the reviewability on the Administrative

Postal Service.

21

This is a judicial review case.

QUESTION:

And I think

At the time of the debate on the

22

Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, was any of that debate

23

addressed to the merits of the private express statute?

No, it wasn't.

MR. LARKIN:

1
2

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We agree with the petitioners that the unions

3
4

cannot bring this law suit under the APA.

As we explained

5

in our opening and reply briefs, we believe that the

6

unions did not and cannot satisfy the zone of interest

7

tests that this Court has set out in its decisions.

8

we and in this case, we alone, also believe that there is

9

an additional reason why the unions cannot invoke the APA

But

10

in this case, and that is that Congress has exempted the

11

Postal Service from the APA by passing section 410(a) of

12

the postal code.
QUESTION:

13
14

15

MR. LARKIN:

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Larkin the Government did

Correct.
Is it permitted to raise a separate

question from that raised by the petitioners?
MR. LARKIN:

21

Normally, no.

There is only one

22

small category of cases where we think that could be done.

23

We think this case fits into that category.

24
25

QUESTION:

What's the authority for that

exception?

MR. LARKIN:

1

2

matter is jurisdictional, and we think that the way this

3

Court discussed this type of issue in the case of Block v.

4

Community Nutrition Institute that it treated these types

5

of issues as being — as the Court said in Block -- in

6

effect jurisdictional.

7

**

The exception would be where the

The last footnote in the Block case, footnote 4,

8

was the footnote in which the Court said that it declined

9

in that case to resolve the Article III question that was

10

before the Court.

11

III was whether the plaintiff's net lawsuit had standing.

12

There was an additional question in .that case of whether

13

or not review was precluded under the APA.

14

resolved the case by looking to the preclusion issue and

15

not resolving the standing issue.

16

what the Court said in the Block case and what the Court

17

did in the Block case indicates that the Court believes an

18

issue like this is one that can be raised in this sort of

19

matter.

The question in that case under Article

So we think that both

jurisdictional in any strict sense of the word at all.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, the term "jurisdictional,"

Your Honor, is one, I readily admit, has been used to

24

cover a variety of different types of claims.

case tends to .indicate, I think, that the Court meant that

Government in that case.

12

type of ground to the decision below.

questions that we briefed in the case, and the Court,

14

rather than resolve the Article III issue, resolved this

15

other issue.

We brought a challenge on that
It was one of the

So that is why, Your Honor, even though I

17

readily confess that we did not raise the issue below, we

18

raised it for the first time in our brief in opposition,

19

and that normally a respondent, of course, cannot

20

interject a new issue into the case.

21

this fits into that category.

22

We think nonetheless

And there is another and a smaller reason, I

23

might like to add at this point, why you — Court may wish

24

to consider it.

MR. LARKIN:
this.

A narrow one.

The narrow one is

As the Court pointed out in the opinion by Justice

White in the Clarke case, the zone of interest tests is
principally a gloss on section 702 of the APA.

If,

therefore, we are right in this case and the APA is
inapplicable to the Postal Service, then that is the type
of issue you would want to consider in deciding whether or
not the zone of interest test is the proper way of looking
at this case.

We think the zone of interest test has not

been satisfied by the unions.
QUESTION:

That surely is not a jurisdictional

argument.
MR. LARKIN:

True.

That — that's not a

jurisdictional one, I agree.
one.

That's more a prudential

And I bring it to your attention because we thought,

since this is one of the issues that a court looking at
this sort of problem would have to consider, that is one
the Court would probably want to keep in mind.
QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, in addition to the APA

problem I guess there's also the question whether the
postal express statutes create a private cause of action,
and of course you say, you say they don't.

Is that a

jurisdictional issue also in your view?
MR. LARKIN:

Well, there is indication of that

in the case that is cited in footnote 4 in the Block

opinion, which is the Amtrak case, where in that case the
Court resolved a cause of action issue without, to the
best of my recollection, resolving a different type of
standing issue.
So if that case — that case would therefore
tend to indicate that a private right of action case,
perhaps only where you're dealing with the Government
rather than a -private party, would at least be seen on
that sort of parallel.

But I would also admit the Amtrak

case did not use the word "forfeit."

It didn't say that

this was the type of issue that could not be forfeited.
Normally, a private right of action issue is not
one that you would think of as a jurisdictional issue.
That I agree.
QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, you didn't raise this

below?
MR. LARKIN:
QUESTION:

Correct, we made a mistake.
Well, do you know of any other

instance where we take up a point that wasn't raised
below?
MR. LARKIN:

Well, generally the Court doesn't

resolve questions that weren't raised below, but for
example, if the Court believes it's necessary properly to
resolve the case — yesterday's opinion is some indication
that the Court will resolve the case at least on a basis

It's a gloss, if you will, on the test of

the Court said in Clarke, is also far more generous than

The private

For that reason

I believe the unions have in part also tried to raise what

2

they call a common law, non-statutory type of claim.

3

Now, this Court has in some limited

circumstances allowed that type of showing to be

sufficient, basically in two types of circumstances.

6

is where someone can satisfy the prerequisites for

obtaining mandamus.

9

strict requirements for mandamus.

10

That the unions cannot do here.

One

In

And the other is best illustrated by the Court's

11

discussion in the case of Stark v. Wickard — is a

12

situation in which Congress has implicitly granted someone

13

the right to bring a suit.

14

showing that we think the unions can make out.

15

essentially the type of showing a union would have to make

out to satisfy the Cort v. Ash test, and we don't think

17

they can satisfy that very strict showing.

That also is not the type of
That is

18

So if you look at it as a matter of the zone of

interests analysis, we don't the unions can satisfy that.

20

They can't show that they are within the zone of interest.

21

And to be perfectly candid, I think no one is within the

22

zone of interest except the Postal Service.

23

of the private express statutes was to protect the Postal

the necessary prerequisites for making out an implied

unlawful.

The unions have, I think, essentially two

arguments that they've made to try to criticize the Postal

Service in this case.

likely to benefit the public as a whole and is likely to

6

benefit those businesses that engage in international

7

business.

8

9

The first is that the rule is not

I think that's a misdirected inquiry.
The .question is not whether the entire public

can make use of a suspension, but is whether the

10

suspension will benefit the public.

In this case, the

11

Postal Service concluded that it would for a variety of

12

reasons benefit the public, and that was based upon

13

information from parties not only in the private sector,

14

as I said, but also from Secretary of Commerce, the

15

Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors,

16

the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and

17

the Attorney General of the United States.

18

indicated that this will help American businesses sell

19

goods overseas, which is in the public interest.

Those comments

20

The second challenge that the unions have raised

21

is that the postal service did not adequately consider the

22

potential revenue effect of the suspension on its ability

23

to serve the public as a whole.

24

criticism is unfair.

QUESTION:
MR. LARKIN:
right.

Well, maybe it's right?
No, it's not.

It's worse than not

It's unfair.

The Postal Service at the outset and at the
\
conclusion of the process admitted that it did not have
the hard data that it would have liked.

It asked the

public for that data, but it wasn't forthcoming.
The .Postal Service therefore faced a decision,
because making no decision — that is, not adopting a
suspension or deferring a suspension would be as much of a
decision as allowing suspension to go into effect.
What the Postal Service did was use a worstcase scenario.

It took a very high over-estimate of the

potential loss that it would suffer," and using that over­
estimate of its potential loss, nonetheless came to the
conclusion that the potential benefits out weighed the
potential loss.
And that's not an irrational result.

Under a

public interest standard, an agency is entitled to make
that sort of assessment, particularly since the agency has
the ability over time to monitor the situation.

If in

fact it were to prove that this would be too financially
debilitating, the Postal Service would have the ability to
modify the suspension or repeal it entire -- in its
entirety.

But what the respondents would have us do in

take no action at all, basically to stymie the agency

In those

For these sorts of reasons and the ones laid out

in our brief, we ask the Court to uphold the Postal

of the APA.

don't adopt.

case and you had a difference of opinion between some

20

officials in the Executive Branch and the Postal Service

21

over whether or not for example this was a practice that

22

could be conducted under the regulations that existed

23

beginning in 1979.

24

forthright way of resolving this problem was to go ahead

and adopt a regulation setting forth its considered view

And in that circumstance, we believe that

what they did was eminently reasonable.
Now, maybe they could have done nothing, but it

would have left this cloud, as Chairman McKean said.

to meet the needs of mailers who needed to go outside the

point that petitioners' arguments are missing, is to

I think it's consistent with the function of the

would not be a reasonable plaintiff for the Court to hear.

But once someone has satisfied the zone of

plaintiff, I think the cases then allow that plaintiff to

challenge the legality under the statute without regard to

Just to finish up the point on costs.

19

question that the Postal Service did not examine was what

20

effect would the loss of revenue that it forecasted have

on the remaining users of the mail.

22

This is very, very simplistic for anyone who is

familiar with the rate-making process, but the Postal

That's an enormous amount of money.

by elaborating on this.

4

questions that are raised by the urgent letter exception,

philosophical assumption of the urgent letter exemption

was that there was a type of service that the public

needed the Postal Service couldn't provide.

at least, the mail volume that was generated by the urgent

Now, the argument advanced by petitioner in this

case focuses primarily on the notion that the private

11

And we're claiming a violation of the postal — of the

private express statutes, which date back to the seven —

couldn't be within the zone of interest.

QUESTION:

MR. SECULAR:

QUESTION:

No substantive change.

So, no part of the debate over the

Postal Reorganization Act in 1970 involved this statute,

which you say is the crux of the Government's power to

MR. SECULAR:

11

That's correct.

out that there really wasn't any reason for Congress to be

1

responses to that — to that point, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

One is that I don't think that the 1960 statute could have

3

been fairly interpreted, at least in terms of

4

congressional intent, as authorizing suspensions of the

5

monopoly.
The Postal Service really began to view 601(b)

6
7

as a source of authority to suspend the monopoly for

8

reasons of policy with respect to certain specific classes

9

of mail, after the Postal Reorganization Act was enacted.

10

That's an historical response.

11

QUESTION:

But did — but did that have any —

MR. SECULAR:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Why is that the crucial section?

It

3

seems to me what you are doing is claiming the benefit of

4

the monopoly, and this is a section authorizing the Postal

5

Service to eliminate the monopoly as to certain portions.

6

But the statute that you claim gives you the protection is

7

the basic conferral of the monopoly upon the Postal

8

Service.

9
10
11
12

MR. SECULAR:
QUESTION:

Well, this —

Not the later provision, whenever it

was adopted, allowing an exception from it.
MR. SECULAR:

Well, I'm not sure, claiming the

13

protection of the monopoly is precisely the right

14

characterization.

15

QUESTION:

Well, you're claiming it was —

16

you're within the zone of interests for which the monopoly

17

was designed.

18

don't see how the exception statute does anything except

19

affect the scope of the monopoly.

20

It seems to me that that's your claim.

MR. SECULAR:

Well, our argument on standing,

21

our basic argument on standing, treats the Postal

22

Reorganization Act and the private express statutes as

23

functionally a — an integrated statutory scheme.

24

that's because essentially the purposes of the Postal

And

The policies of the Postal

Reorganization Act cannot be achieved without the

monopolies.

Similarly, the purposes of the monopoly, viewed

post-1970, are to effectuate and guarantee the conditions

afterwards, weren't they?

MR. SECULAR:

18

That's correct.

That's correct.

The Postal Reorganization Act didn't

change them.
MR. SECULAR:

That's correct.

But a related

19

point, which I haven't articulated quite yet, is that it

20

shouldn't matter whether private express statutes and the

21

Postal Reorganization Act are considered one statute or

22

two statutes or however many statutes, because if that

23

were true then there would be -- the holdings of the

24

banking law cases from Data Processors on through Clarke

25

would have been different.

In Data Processors, for example, the claim, the

2

only claim on the merits that was made, was that the

3

allowance of national banks to perform data processing

services was a violation of the National Bank Act.

5

it came to standing, the court looked not the national --

Similarly, in the Investment Corporation case
that followed just a couple of years later, the claim on

Act was designed to protect the interests of businesses in

Well, there was no

It was designed to protect

and safeguard the interest of the national banks.
Nonetheless, the court, citing Data Processors,

found that the policies recognized in Data Processors were

sufficient to confirm standing.

on the merits were the anti-branching provisions of title

Mr. Secular, I'm not quite clear on

why it is essential to the Postal Reorganization Act and

the various things it accomplished that there also be a

7

MR. SECULAR:

The basic rationale for that was

8

articulated in the 1973 Governor's Report.

Briefly, what

9

— the focus is on the requirement of the Postal

10

Reorganization Act that the Postal Service provide

11

universal service at uniform rates.

12

concepts are important.

13

uniform service at a uniform rate to thinly populated

companies can skim off profitable mail service in highly

populated urban areas.

the rates charged by the Postal Service would skyrocket
above and beyond the rate of inflation, which would have a
devastating impact on volume.

MR. SECULAR:

Well, the Postmaster General has

made that a fact, and I think that points up our argument
on the merits.

3 percent loss of revenue, if that's all

that the Postal Service is talking about, could very well
be the difference between whether or not rates go up more
than or less than the rate of inflation.

It's that

tradeoff which the Postal Service never examined.

Maybe competition might determine it,

too.

MR. SECULAR:

that the Postal Service has to maintain a fixed,

from responding to competition out on the fringes in those

particular areas where rates — where rates -- where a

lower rate could be charged by a private business while

9

competing with the Postal Service.
That's essentially the rationale that was

11

articulated in the 1973 Governor's Report.

12

rationale that underscores the conditions which the Postal
