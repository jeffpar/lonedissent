ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER M. LIEB

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LIEB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether an individual

12

who has no business is eligible for chapter 11 of the

13

Bankruptcy Code.

14

Court to adopt a business requirement for chapter 11, even

15

though such a requirement is contrary to the plain

16

language of the statute and would add a complexity to

17

bankruptcy cases that was not intended by Congress.

18

The amicus in this case has urged this

Section 109(d) of the Bankruptcy Code by its

19

terms provides that a person, except for a stockbroker or

20

a commodities broker, who is eligible for chapter 7 is

21

also eligible for chapter 11.

22

defines the word "person" to include an individual,

23

partnership, or corporation.

24

words is that, except for a stockbroker or commodities-

25

broker, an individual, partnership, or corporation who is

Section 101.37 of the code

The plain meaning of these

1

eligible for chapter 7 is also eligible for chapter 11.

2

And since there is no dispute in this case that an

3

individual without a business is eligible for a chapter 7,

4

the statute by its terms makes them eligible for chapter

5

11 as well.
Now, the use of the word "person" in section

6

7

109(d) cannot be viewed as a legislative oversight or a

8

carelessly chosen word.

9

exclusively on eligibility for the various chapters, and

10

Congress demonstrated in section 109 that it knew how to

11

limit eligibility for the various chapters, and that it

12

even knew how to distinguish some persons from other

13

persons.

14

eligibility in chapter 13 to some individuals.

In section 109 Congress focused

Section 109(e), for example, limits the

Congress also demonstrated in section 1304 that

15
16

it knew how to distinguish individuals who were engaged in

17

a business from individuals who were not engaged in a

18

business.

19

in this case that there is rto express business requirement

20

in the code for chapter 11 is a clear indication that no

21

such requirement was intended by Congress.

And so we believe that the amicus' concession

22

The amicus —

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Lieb, if you're right, does this

24

mean that consumer debtors can be placed into involuntary

25

bankruptcy under chapter 11 by creditors?

2

It does mean that, although we think

it's unlikely that that will happen very often.

3

QUESTION:

Why is that?

4

MR. LIEB:

Because — because — for the same

5

reasons that we think that consumers will not generally —

6

well, it doesn't generally make sense for a consumer to

7

use chapter 11 because of the complexity and the length of

8

a chapter 11 proceeding.

9

creditors will not want to put consumer debtors into

And for the same reasons

10

chapter 11 because of the added complexity and the length

11

of the proceedings.

12

force them into chapter 7.

MR. LIEBs

15

QUESTION:

It may make sense in most cases to

Well, Congress certainly expressly

rejected that under chapter 13, didn't it?
MR. LIEB:

Congress did reject that in chapter

16

13, but there were peculiar reasons for rejecting that in

17

chapter 13 which don't apply in chapter 11.

18

principal concern in chapter 13 was a concern with

19

involuntary servitude, and that's reflected in statements

20

in the legislative history.

21

13 a plan must provide for the payment of future wages

22

pursuant to the plan of reorganization.

23

such requirement in chapter 11 that future wages be used

24

in the plan of reorganization.

25

expressly excludes future wages from property of the

Congress'

And that's because in chapter

estate.

And so the concern about involuntary servitude

2

that was expressed in the legislative history just doesn't

3

apply in chapter 11.

4

The amicus has suggested in its argument that

5

the exclusive purpose of chapter 11 is to resuscitate

6

failing businesses, and that making individuals eligible

7

for chapter 11 without a business serves no purpose of the

8

Bankruptcy Code, and we think that this is plainly wrong.

9

A fundamental purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to

10

maximize the value of the estate, and there are instances

11

when a liquidation or reorganization in chapter 11 will

12

maximize the value of the estate versus a liquidation in

13

chapter 7.

14

trustee is under a duty presumed to section 704 to

15

liquidate the assets to cash as expeditiously as possible.

16

And expeditiously is the word used in section 704.

In chapter 7 a trustee is appointed and the

17

In chapter 11, by contrast, in most cases no

18

trustee is appointed, and chapter 11 offers individual

19

debtors the flexibility to propose plans of reorganization

20

which liquidate or reorganize over an extended period of

21

time.

23

sale atmosphere that often accompanies sales by trustees,

24

which will yield less in chapter 7 than if they are sold

25

pursuant to a chapter 11 plan.

And there were certain types of assets which when

QUESTION:

Just to help the creditor?

2

MR. LIEB:

Well, the — if I take it your

question is asked what is the individual debtor's motive,

4

the motive is to yield as much as possible to pay off his

creditors in full and hopefully to regain some of the

value that may exist in the asset.

to retain the property for himself and maybe, maybe he's

MR. LIEB:

MR. LIEB:

He can postpone secured creditors,

and secured creditors — I mean, if secured creditors feel

like they are not getting as much as they are entitled to,

8

they may, they can vote against the plan and prevent it

from being confirmed.

QUESTION:

So — but in any event —
Can the creditors clearly prohibit

the chapter 11 plan if they choose?

12

MR. LIEB:

If a sufficient number or amount of

creditors in one class votes against it, then they can

14

prevent the plan from being confirmed.

QUESTION:

Well, what if all there is basically

MR. LIEB:

1

I think in

that secured creditors

are often considered in a different class.

3

secured creditor is in a different class and votes against

4

the plan, it — he can still prevent the plan from being

5

confirmed if he can establish that he would receive less

6

than he would in the chapter 7 liquidation.

7

QUESTION:

And if the

Well, under chapter 11 I take it the

8

debtor can propose and the court can approve a lower rate

9

of interest on the mortgage, and can modify the maturity

10

of the debt?
MR. LIEB:

11

A debtor could propose that, but if,

12

for example, the secured, the mortgagee would not receive

13

the same amount doing the arithmetic that he would receive

14

in a chapter 7 liquidation and decided to object, the plan

15

can't be confirmed, pursuant to section 1129.

17

out of references in the code and the legislative history

18

to the business uses of chapter 11.

19

there are numerous references in the code and the

But we believe that those references demonstrate Congress'

A mom and pop store could have

important indications.

consumer debts, if Congress wanted to exclude individuals

I think raising that point has two very
First, since the code does define

1

with purely consumer debtors from chapter 11 it would have

2

been very easy to add a phrase to section 109(d).

3

with stockbrokers and commodity brokers who are excluded

4

from chapter 11, Congress simply could have added the

5

phrase individuals with only consumer debts, and that

6

would have had the same effect as the Eighth Circuit's

7

judgment in this case.

8
9

Along

The second point, and based on the definition of
consumer debtor in the code, is that it is very wise for

10

Congress not to include such a bar.

12

primary reason why debts were contracted.

13

adopted an ongoing business requirement or a consumer debt

14

limitation as part of a chapter 11 threshold inquiry, the

15

bankruptcy court would have to figure out why primarily

16

debts were contracted.

17

It's a very difficult

So if you

Looking at petitioner's debts in this case

18

indicates how difficult that can be.

The entire schedule

19

of debts is basically credit card debts, utility debts,

20

many of which were contracted for a business purpose as

21

part of this petitioner's consulting business or as part

22

of his business to get — to solicit charitable

23

contributions, both of which were businesses.

have at the start of a bankruptcy litigation.

So it's

1

If a mom and pop store does file under chapter

2

11, the store can adjust and reorganize both the business

3

debts and the consumer debts as defined in the code.

4

fact in 1990 according to statistics from the

5

administrative office of U.S. courts, more than 2,500, or

6

12 percent of chapter 11 cases were filed by individuals

7

primarily with consumer debts.

8

unnatural for bankruptcy courts to reorganize cases when

9

the primary debts to reorganize are consumer debts.

In

So it's not at all

Given

10

that that's the case, there's no reason in the Bankruptcy

11

Code or in bankruptcy policy to prevent mom and pop from

12

going in and reorganizing just their consumer debts, and

13

not bring in the store as well.

14

Three points very briefly this afternoon.

15

First, reorganization serves a useful purpose.

16

won't be subject to abuse.

17

the code regardless of whether we think it's a good idea.

18

Chapter 11 serves a useful purpose for reorganizing

19

consumer debts for two reasons.

20

are worth more in chapter 11 than they are in chapter 11.

21

And that's because some assets have no ready market

22

because there is no pool of competing buyers.

23

debtor's business.

Section 1103 authorizes an equity

security holders committee to investigate the operation of
the debtor's business and the desirability of the
continuation of that business.

Section 1106 authorizes a

similar investigation into the debtor's business by the
trustee.

Other examples are

collected at pages 9 and 10 of our brief.
Now these provisions and many others show that
chapter 11 was essentially structured for the business
debtor and not for the consumer debtor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton, what is your response

to a point made by Mr. Marzen that if we accepted your
contention we would be establishing kind of a very
difficult jurisdictional test?

How do we define when

someone is a business debtor and when not?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, this is obviously, Mr.

Chief Justice, a factual question.

In this particular

case it was easy for the court to decide that Mr. Toibb's
debts were consumer debts, that he was not operating a
business, and therefore he was a consumer debtor and not a
business debtor.

I believe in any situation you will have

a factual question.

But in many of the situations that

are dealt with in the cases that we have cited, the court
had no difficulty making this determination.

Moreover, the principal ambiguous passages which are cited
at pages 13 and 14 of our brief can best be interpreted to
mean that individual business debtors can use chapter 11,
but individual consumer debtors cannot.

To read these

passages to say that any individual can proceed under
chapter 11, as petitioner and the Solicitor General do, is
to ignore the definitive passage from the House report
that I have just quoted.
Now, other code provisions, principally those in
chapter 13, demonstrate that chapter 11 is not intended
for consumer nonbusiness debtors.

Chapter 13 of course is

the chapter that allows certain consumer debtors to devise
debt repayment plans, that allows them to retain their
assets and to pay their creditors out of future disposable
income over a 3- to 5-year period.

Chapter 13 allows only

In other words, creditors may not force

debtors into chapter 13 debt repayment plans.
There is good reason for this.

Congress wisely

recognized that a debt restructuring plan, in the words of
the Senate report, only works where there is a willing
debtor who wants to repay his creditors.

Now whether

creditors should be able to force consumers into chapter
13 plans was a hotly disputed issue when the code was
passed.

The credit industry lost in its attempt to enact

legislation that would do just that.

But under chapter 11 creditors can force debtors

2

into involuntary bankruptcy plans.

Consequently, if

consumer debtors are eligible for chapter 11 they could be

forced into such involuntary plans.

5

seemingly would be inherently infeasible if consumer

because the Court could not force Mr. Toibb to go out and

13

More importantly, it is difficult to conclude

14

that Congress would expressly refrain from forcing

15

consumer debtors into chapter 13 plans, and then turn

16

around and decide that consumer debtors could be forced

into chapter 11 involuntary plans without clearly stating

observe that Congress decided that consumer debtors like
