CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. MARK WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The principle to be applied in this case is that

11

jurisdiction under a Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires

12

an allegation and if controverted proof that the restraint

13

alleged to have been imposed by the defendants has as a

14

matter of practical economics a not insubstantial effect

15

on interstate commerce.

16

to allege for jurisdictional purposes has Dr. Pinhas has

17

only that either the plaintiff or the defendants are

18

engaged in interstate commerce.

19

principle stems from the plain language of the act, the

20

purposes for which it was enacted, the case interpreting

21

the act including the claim, and the extent of

22

congressional power under the Commerce Clause.

23

Accordingly it is not sufficient

Petitioners believe this

We start by looking at the plain language of the

24

act.

25

of trade or commerce among the several states.

Section 1 prohibits those conspiracies in restraint

The

1

purpose of that language at the time it was enacted was to

2

allow the Federal Government to supplement the acts of

3

state in regulating anti-competitive activities which

4

individual states could not, namely anti-competitive

5

activities which went beyond the state and went from state

6

to state.

7

As this Court held in its early decision Apex

8

Hoisery, the addition of the words were commerce among the

9

states was the means to relate the prohibited restraint of

10

trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes

11

so Congress could penalize restraints involving or

12

affecting interstate commerce which it perceived as the

13

reach of its power under the Commerce Clause.

14

As this Court went on to note in the Frankfort

15

Distilleries case, this results in an obvious distinction

16

between a course of conduct wholly within a state often

17

referred to a purely local and conduct which although

18

local in an inseparable element of a larger program which

19

depends for its success upon activity which affects

20

commerce among the several states.
The import of the precise language of Section 1

21
22

has been highlighted in a number of decisions by the

23

Court.

24

Paving, a case which the Court relied upon in its

25

subsequent decision in McLain.

Most notably in Gulf Oil Corporation v. Copp

In that case, the Court

1

drew a distinction between the language of Section 1 of

2

the Sherman Act and the language of the Clayton Act.

3

held that the words, restrain of trade or commerce among

4

the states, meant that the jurisdictional reach of Section

5

1 was keyed directly to effect on interstate markets and

6

the interstate flow of goods.

7

was Justice Marshall's concurrence in Gulf Oil where he

8

noted that the phrase, among the several states, embraces

9

all commerce save or except that which is confined to a

10

It

And the import in that case

single state as it does not affect other states.

11

In so holding the Court went on to state that as

12

a result of its provisions, a jurisdictional inquiry under

13

the Sherman Act was to be a particular one focusing on the

14

facts and circumstances presented in each case.

15

reason for that particularized determination was the need

16

to identify a specific restraint because Congress was

17

regulating restraints which were among the states.

18

need would not exist if all that was required was to point

19

to something that was called a line of commerce or a class

20

of activities to create jurisdiction.

21

this Court simply read out of the act the words or --

22

among the states and commerce among the states and simply

23

said that this was an act to prohibit restraints of trade

25

language requires more.

It is the language of Section 1 which also

1
2

distinguishes its reach from other cases where Congress

3

itself, other statutes where this Court has considered,

4

that Congress itself has defined the specific persons and

5

activities that affect Congress and therefore, their

6

effect — excuse me — they affect commerce and therefore

7

require Federal regulation.

8
9

If we look at cases such as Perez v. United
States, Russell v. United States, even Heart of Atlanta,

10

Wickard against Filburn, those are all cases where

11

Congress has engaged in specific fact finding to find that

12

the cumulative effect of some particular evil has an

13

affect on interstate commerce.

14

the Sherman Act has not been accompanied by specific

15

congressional findings to the effect that a class of

16

activities in particular has an effect on interstate

17

commerce.

18

Act, it is required to engage in a case by case review of

19

particular allegations and particular complaints to see

20

whether in fact there is a restraint which significantly,

21

substantially, and adversely affects interstate commerce.

A general statute such as

QUESTION:

23

about our opinion in McLain?

between the particular activity at interstate commerce but

that between -- I mean the particular offense, but rather

2

between the business activity in general and interstate

3

commerce, namely brokeraging*?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I don't real McLain that way.
You don't?
I think the way I read McLain is

7

that the Court looked at a situation which involved a

8

brokerage for four years in New Orleans and looked at an

9

alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates which are part

10

of the price.

11

sales and the Court engaged in some detailed fact finding

12

actually based on a real record to say that that volume of

13

sales affected interstate commerce as a result of

14

financing from out of state or title insurance that came

15

from out of state.

16

distinguish McLain on that basis.

17

And the price would affect the volume of

So .1 think factually one can

Admittedly there is language in McLain which we

18

find to be ambiguous, for example, and does talk about

19

general activities in the brokerage business or the

20

general activities of one of the parties.

21

don't believe that that is the actual test that McLain

22

established.

23

specifically towards the end of the opinion restates the

24

Federal jurisdictional requirement that there be as a

25

matter practical economics a not insubstantial effect on

However, I

Indeed, Chief Justice Burger at the time

1

interstate commerce by the restraint that has been

2

allegedly imposed by the defendants.
So in the case McLain the restrain that was

3
4

allegedly imposed by the defendant was a conspiracy to fix

5

an inseparable part of the price of real estate and that

6

price fixing activity would affect as the Court found by

7

looking at the actual facts in question that title

8

insurance coming in from out of state in very significant

9

volumes of commerce.

This was a case that involved real

10

estate brokers throughout New Orleans over a period of 4

11

years.

12

I think it's also note worthy in looking at the

13

McLain decision itself, several things to indicate that

14

McLain did not attempt to set a new rule.

15

commentators have suggested that it did set a new rule.

16

First of all, the cases relied upon by McLain

I think some

17

are for example Gulf Oil, Goldfarb, Trustees of Rex, were

18

clearly no nude* rule was at work in those cases.

19

addition, the Chief Justice at that time judge — joined

20

Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Jefferson Peers* v.

21

Hyde* which in footnote 5 specifically says that there's

22

got to be an effect on commerce for there to be Section 1

23

jurisdiction.

In addition, I think that the practice this
Court has engaged in over time is to stand by a settled*

1

authority which would say that you leave statutory

2

interpretations with respect to jurisdictional scope in

3

place and leave the task of modifying that scope to

4

Congress.

5

that this Court was attempting, if you will, to supplant

6

Congress and in Petitioner's view amend the statute to

7

read out the words, among the states.

8

distinguish McLain first by say I think it is

9

distinguishable from the facts of this case.

There's no indication in the decision in McLain

So I would

Second, I think the plain reading of McLain and

10

11

the activity that was actually engaged in by the Court

12

shows that the Court simply didn't identify real estate

13

brokerage activities as an activity and say, we need go no

14

further.

15

say the activity we're focusing on is price fixing and how

16

does price fixing affect real estate transactions.

17

don't believe McLain stands for a position contrary to

18

that which is being urged by the Petitioners in this case.

19

The Court I think went through great pains to

QUESTION:

Price fixing in general or price

20

fixing in this particular case with respect to these

21

particular real estate transactions?

22

So I

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not sure I understand the

23

import of the question.

24

was price fixing in commissions by all the brokers in New

25

Orleans for a period of 4 years.

What was the focus of that case

So they focused on that

1

particular transaction and found, in at least my reading

2

of the case, found that that was part of setting the

3

price.

4

and if you're going to affect the price, you're obviously

5

going to affect the volume of sales.

6

- inclined even to go beyond that and say, well, what

7

difference did it make?

8

hundreds of millions of dollars of out-of-state financing,

9

title insurance, and so forth.

10
11

So if the brokers commission is part of the price

And the Court felt -

The difference it made were

So it obviously went

further than that to reach the result.
As I mentioned I think that McLain also is

12

consistent with the cases that preceded it and the 2 cases

13

of great import that preceded were Goldfarb and Trustees

14

of Rex Hospital.

15

Now in Goldfarb the Court went to great lengths

16

to examine the particular transactions in question, that

17

was the legal services involved in that case, to find that

18

those specific legal services were coincidental with the

19

interstate real estate transactions in terms of time, more

20

importantly in their view, in terms of continuity.

21

The critical reason for that determination was

22

the need to distinguish essentially local restraints which

23

would have nothing to do with interstate commerce and the

24

specific real estate services provided in that case which

25

did affect interstate commerce.

And this conclusion I

10

1

believe is made clear by the language in Goldfarb which

2

specifically recognizes that there may well be legal

3

services which have no effect on interstate commerce.

4

one need only identify legal services as a line of

5

business or a class of activities that affect commerce,

6

there would have been no need to first trace the

7

particular relationship of the activities in question in

8

that case with interstate commerce or to go on and say

9

that there may well be legal services which may have no

10

If

effect on interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Waxman, I, I want to ask you a

12

question on McLain, following up on Justice Scalia's

13

question.

14

page 242 of 444 U.S. — it says, petitioners need not make

15

the more particularized showing of an effect on interstate

16

commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix

17

commission rates.

18

it's enough if you're showing a substantial effect on

19

interstate commerce generated by the brokerage activity.

20

Now, it seems to me those 2 sentences certainly are, are

21

not themselves ambiguous, that you, you can show it by

22

showing the activity that the plaintiffs, rather that the

23

defendants are in.

24

restraint affected interstate commerce.

25

There is some rather specific language there at

And the sentence before that says, it,

You don't have to show that the actual

In addition, I also read the language

You need not prove that there was an

And read in that context, I don't believe

10

that this language changes the position that the

11

Petitioners are espousing.
QUESTION:

12

Then you think the Court has a

13

different thing in mind for a jurisdictional showing as a,

14

as opposed to the, the showing you have to make on the

15

merits?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

I believe that the Court -- I

17

believe that it's not required for jurisdictional purpose

18

that you prove that the conspiracy would be, would have

19

been successful.

20

Jurisdiction is more of a threshold inquiry.

21

And in that sense, it is different.

QUESTION:

But would you have to — improving

22

your case on the merits you wouldn't have had to show the

23

conspiracy was successful, would you?

a substantial effect on interstate commerce which is

2

exactly what the Court goes on to state that towards the

3

end of the decision where it indicates that either side -

factual showing.

13

be some further showing before there's a resulting

violation.

15

Court was not going to require the same, if you will,

16

degree of showing to show that jurisdiction existed in the

17

first instance.

18
19

So the Court

For jurisdictional purposes, however, the

QUESTION:

Does that really make a lot of sense

do you think?
MR. WAXMAN:

The same language applies to the

involved.

So in my — there is some reason to go about

6

QUESTION:

May I ask — may I ask you a

7

question?

I'm a little puzzled about what you —

8

supposing they allege a brokerage conspiracy such as you

9

describe.

They prove that the defendants all got together

10

in a room and agreed on a fixed rate of brokerage and then

11

2 weeks later they all decided they would abandon the

12

agreement.

13

this agreement in place and it just never affected a

14

single transaction.

15

not?

16

They didn't do it — but for 2 weeks they had

MR. WAXMAN:

Would a crime have been committed or

I don't believe jurisdiction would

17

exist under the Sherman Act if nothing ever happened.

18

That's because there's a requirement that there actually

19

be some sort of restraint on interstate commerce.

20

QUESTION:

So you really have to prove more to

21

prove jurisdiction than you do to prove the crime, because

22

it's kind of a horn-book* law that the conspiracy itself

23

is the heart the offense under —

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:
of offense.

The conspiracy would be the heart

I don't have any quarrel with that.

The

1

question is if the conspiracy never — didn't go anywhere,

2

didn't affect anything whatsoever, then in my view you

3

wouldn't have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

4

Why do you — why do you have to take

5

that view?

Couldn't, couldn't you take the view which is

6

still a good deal short of what the Government proposes

7

that the test it whether the conspiracy, if successful,

8

would have actually affected interstate commerce?
MR. WAXMAN:

9

Because I agree I don't have to

10

take that view.

And one could stop significantly short of

But you —

QUESTION:

Your view is that there actually has

19

to be an effect on interstate commerce, not, not what --

20

it's just not that if it were successful there would have

21

been an effect?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I think my view — no, my view

23

is not that you have to go to the success of the

24

particular conspiracy that's alleged, but that its logical

25

conclusion would have resulted in a restraint which

substantially affects interstate-commerce.
QUESTION:

2

Well, then what you're really arguing

3

is not the thing must allege an effect, but that they must

4

allege a tendency to affect, isn't that true?
MR. WAXMAN:

5
6

Well, I'm not, I'm not sure I would

know the, the real difference between a tendency to affect

QUESTION:

8

9
10

Well, a tendency that may not be

realized.
MR. WAXMAN:

No, I think I would have to back up

11

somewhat from what I said and indicate that what they

12

actually would have to allege is that, is that there would

13

be a logical connection between success, if you will, and

14

a substantial effect on interstate commerce to create the

15
16

-Section 1 jurisdiction.
The Government's view, however, is significantly

17

different than that.

According to the Government, one

18

need only show that the anti-competitive behavior occurs

19

within something they call a class of commercial activity

20

which affects interstate commerce or that the defendants

21

are in a-line of business which affects commerce for

22

Section 1 jurisdiction to be established.

23

the fact that that's not what Section 1 says, one can

1

yourself, to delivering a service or providing for

2

shelter, inevitably has some role as a class of activity

3

or line of business which would affect interstate commerce

4

in the aggregate.
Accordingly, the Government's views appear too

of McLain, finding a real commercial relationship between

12

the anti-competitive conduct and interstate commerce would

have been totally unnecessary, because legal services,

real estate sales, hospital building in and of themselves,

obviously as a class of activities significantly affect

interstate commerce.

Acceptance of the plain meaning of the statute

also doesn't mean as the United States and as the various

19

states that filed an amicus brief have said that for some

20

reason anti-competitive activities will go unchallenged.

21

Anti-competitive activity meriting attack on a truly local

level is still the subject of enforcement activity at that

23

level.

24

passage of the Sherman Act was to supplement state anti­

25

trust enforcement efforts, not to supplant them.

This

1

Court has already recently held in California v. ARC

2

America Corporation that the Federal anti-trust laws do

3

not supplant but may be supplemented by other local state

4

government enforcement efforts.

5

Now the principle to be applied in this case

6

requiring a restraint which has a not insubstantial effect

7

to interstate commerce, also mandates that the holding of

8

the Ninth Circuit on interstate commerce be reversed for a

9

number of reasons.

10

First, without any factual record before it or

11

even a factual allegation by the plaintiff, the Ninth

12

Circuit apparently made findings that peer review

13

proceedings in and of themselves have an effect on

14

interstate commerce and peer review proceedings affect the

15

entire medical staff of a hospital and, therefore,

16

interstate commerce is affected.

17

Now both of these statements as I indicated are

18

unsupported by any record.

19

actually they're incorrect.

20

Health Care Quality Improvement Act, noted that peer

21

review is not essentially commercial activity in the

22

typical case and would not have an adverse effect on

23

interstate commerce certainly in every case as the Ninth

24

Circuit seemed to be positing.

25

All we have is a complaint and

1

proceeding or even a series of medical staff proceedings

2

affect either the hospital's entire medical staff in every

3

case or the hospital's interstate commerce in every case

4

no matter who was or was not actually affected, no matter

5

what the scope of the peer review proceeding might have

6

been.

7

nowhere in the record and is not the case, in particular

8

by the illustrations by the amicus hospital associations*.

Again, it's simply a factual assertion that is

I think the Ninth Circuit's conclusion is

9
10

analogous to say because I'm a member of the California

11

Bar Association which is mandatory in California that I am

12

somehow affected by every state bar disciplinary

13

proceeding no matter what the subject was, no matter what

14

its result was, whether I knew about it or 1 didn't know

15

about it.

16

that far or even suggesting that somehow interstate

17

commerce is implicated every time someone is excluded from

18

a medical staff, an organization, an association, or some

19

other membership and for that reason, the Government's

20

views and the Ninth Circuit's views are simply too far.

21

There is no decision where the court has gone

In short, I think the Ninth Circuit decision

22

under any test whether it's a Government's test or whether

23

it's a test that petitioners believe should be applied,

24

should be reversed.

1

The remaining numbered circuits except for the

2

fourth which has thus far avoided a determination of the

3

issue have determined that the McLain reading is much more

4

narrow and implies an affected activities' test.

5

What this — this case is controlled by McLain.

6

But I think we have to take one step back if we can to the

7

Rex Hospital case.

8

case, but the Rex Hospital case which came before it,

9

that's a plaintiff's case.

No one calls it the hospital building

McLain is a defendant's case

10

and the Pinhas case is a plaintiff/defendant's case and

11

allow me to explain, if I may.

12

In Rex Hospital a hospital sued for anti-trust

13

violations against another hospital.

It asserted that the

14

second defendant hospital interfered with its activities

15

to expand its interstate commerce.

Justice Marshall determined that the plaintiff's purchase

20

Medicare and Medicaid from the Federal Government, that

21

the plaintiff's receipt of supplies from out-of-state

22

sellers, that the plaintiff's insurance receipts from out-

23

of-state insurance companies, and the plaintiff's

24

treatment of patients from out of state was sufficient

25

basis in interstate commerce to justify jurisdiction.

one phrase in the opinion that appears that one of the

may it please the Court:
The way the courts of appeals have described the

3

conflict that has developed in applying McLain is

4

something of a false dichotomy.

5

on the one side some courts have held that the relevant

6

inquiry is whether any of the defendant's activities or

7

the defendant's general business activities affect

8

commerce and on the other side, courts say the question is

9

whether the challenged conduct, the allegedly illegal

10
11

They generally say that

conduct in itself affects commerce.
The relevant inquiry for analyzing a Sherman Act

12

claim is what is the line of commerce or the line of

13

business activity being restrained by the alleged

14

violation and it is in our view that line of activity that

15

must satisfy the interstate commerce nexus, whether or not

16

the defendant is also engaged in additional business

17

activities that affect commerce and whether or not the

18

alleged unlawful conduct in itself also affects Congress.

19

And when McLain is read in that light, we

20

believe that it contains no ambiguity.

In that case, the

21

complaint was about a price fixing conspiracy among real

22

estate brokerage firms.

23

whether some of the defendants were also engaged in other

24

business activities, property management for example,

25

because those activities would have been irrelevant to the

restraint being alleged and in that light, the -- two

2

sentences from the opinion that we have set forth on page

3

8 of our brief to which Chief Justice Rehnquist has

already alluded seem entirely clear to us.
The court first says it would be sufficient for

activity.

MR. WALLACE:

It's, it's

It's that portion of the

Respondent's brokerage activities

and then there, there is a further question whether their

22

effect on commerce should be looked upon in isolation or

23

as one of a class of activities that Congress can

24

regulate, but before that question arises I want to refer

25

to language appearing later in the McLain opinion which

some courts have used to inject ambiguity into the opinion

2

and this appears at page 4 —■ 246 of 444 U.S. and the

3

sentence is at the very top of the page, to establish

4

Federal jurisdiction in this case, there remains only the

5

requirement that Respondent's activities which allegedly

6

have been infected* by a price fixing conspiracy must be

7

shown as a matter of practical economics to have a not

insubstantial .effect on the interstate commerce involved.

9

In context, it seems to us clear that

10

Respondent's activities which have been infected refers to

11

the brokerage activities.

12

consistently with what the court so clearly said just a

13

few pages earlier rather than to read this sentence

14

circuitously to contradict what the court had already said

15

without ambiguity.

16

If this sentence is to be read

And so it seems to us that the Court in McLain

17

did what it was striving to do in the context of the

18

argument that was before it which was to reconcile its

19

interpretation of the Sherman Act with the general trend

20

of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

very heavily in the arguments before the Court and the

QUESTION:

exposure.
QUESTION:

I take it a nurse might allege —

3

make the same allegations that she assists faster at

4

operations than the other nurses and she's been

5

discriminated against for that reason.

6

MR. WALLACE:

It could happen.

But, of course,

7

the case I posited was one where she just claims she wants

8

to provide services in the same manner that they are being

9

provided by others.

And another key part of the doctor's

10

complaint was that he thought it was unnecessary to have

11

an assistant surgeon and this was adding an element of

12

great cost to the operations.

13

So what was involved in this complaint was a

14

fairly classic allegation of injury to competition.

15

our point here in showing that the nurses employment

16

relationship really is within the scope of the commerce

17

power even though her complaint may not allege an injury

18

to competition is that the interstate commerce requirement

19

of the Sherman Act should not be distorted into an

20

improper and ill-fitting tool with which to try to perform

21

the substantive screening operation of identifying

22

insubstantial anti-trust complaints.

That is our position and that is

8

the point made by the 22 states that have filed an amicus

brief in this case, agreeing with our position and

10

pointing out that at least one state doesn't have any

11

state anti-trust laws at all and pointing out deficiencies

12

in other state anti-trust laws and that, as a matter of

fact, there is great reliance on the Sherman Act as

protection.

It's

just like saying if Congress passes a law saying nobody

can kill a ladybug in interstate commerce, interstate

3

commerce if given the broadest possible meaning, but you

4

still have to kill the ladybug.
MR. WALLACE:

5

With all respect, I do not believe

that is a fair reading of those cases which said that the

protection that Congress afforded reached to the utmost

extent.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, that's usually dicta anyway in

those cases.
MR. WALLACE:

It, it, it, it, it could be

12

considered that, but it has been the basis for expanding

13

the reach of the Sherman Act repeatedly as the court's

14

notion of the reach of the Commerce Clause have similarly

15

expanded because the, the act has been interpreted to

16

afford the protections to whatever is the currently

17

accepted notion of the reach of the commerce power.

18

it's a form of dictum that could arguably part of the

19

ratio decidendi of those case.

20

So

And another lesson of this Court's Commerce

21

Clause decisions such as Wickard against Filburn is that

22

the substantiality of the effect on commerce is not to be

23

belittle by viewing an individual instance in isolation

24

without regard to the aggregate affect of similar

25

restraints on individuals or the deterrent effect of the

sanction applied to this one individual, the deterrent

2

effect on others of similarly attempting to increase

3

efficiency by similar activities if they see that this

4

doctor can be sanctioned for trying to eliminate the

5

assistant surgeon from this procedure.

6

And these cumulative effects which can be wide

7

spread but relatively minor in the individual infractions

8

are important to our enforcement programs as we've

accounted on page 15 of our brief.

principle wherein those cases Congress engaged in specific

2

fact findings, stressing the regulation of local incidence

as an activity that was necessary to abate a cumulative

evil affecting national commerce.

5

reasoning Commerce can clearly adopt, regulation which

affect commerce and agriculture, could adopt many acts

which govern specific areas such as the civil rights laws

where Congress itself engaged in the fact finding which

But despite those holdings and as the Chief

Justice notices some broad dicta in those holdings, there

have to be limits and there are limits somewhere on the

commerce power and those limits are contained in the

language of Section 1 itself.

One need only look at the specific language of the statute

itself and construe the statutory language to say

jurisdiction under that statute requires the showing the

Petitioners' request.

seems to concede the 2 teenage baby sitters to fix the

The notion that the Government

Petitioners agree that would not be enough

8

although Congress could easily call this the line of

commerce involving child and home care or the line of

10

commerce involving care of children throughout the country

11

which would obviously have significant import on an

12

interstate commerce basis for the economy as a whole.

13

think that illustration is perhaps the illustration of why

14

the principle that the Government seeks to enforce in this

case goes too far.

And the example —

You should answer my question yes or

no.
MR. WAXMAN:

No.

If he was the only physician

involved as the subject of that particular conspiracy and

11

the affect of restraining him had no substantial effect on

12

out-of-state patients, out-of-state of purchases of

supplies, out-of-state products or equipment, then he

14

would not be able to stay the case which created Sherman

16

that is important in requiring a substantial affect on

interstate commerce as a result of these specific

provisions of Section 1.

19

On that basis, the Petitioners believe that this

QUESTION:

What if they allege — let me just be

MR. WAXMAN:

Does that state a claim?

I think that if one could allege

and ultimately controvert* make the showing that the

13

conspiracy to impose the assistant surgeon requirement had

14

a specific effect on a volume of interstate commerce such

15

as it affected the total volume of surgeries at a

significant level of those coming from out of state, a
