ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BROOKE LATHRAM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. LATHRAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The most prejudicial conduct in which the

12

prosecution engaged in this case involved what I believe

13

to be the least controversial part of Booth v. Maryland.

14

I refer to Booth's condemnation of survivor opinion about

15

the sentence that a capital defendant should receive.

16

And I refer, in the context of this case, to the

17

prosecutor's concluding remarks in his closing argument

18

during the sentencing trial.

19

prosecutor, in effect, demanded that the jury impose £he

20

death sentence in order to satisfy the anticipated desire

21

of young Nicholas Christopher for Payne's execution.

22

In the course of that, the

It is true, of course, that in this case no

23

witness actually took the stand and testified that they

24

wanted Payne executed.

25

worse than that, I respectfully submit.

But what happened here was much

And along that

1

line, I think it would be a terrible mistake if we were to

2

allow the State to avoid the consequences of calling a

3

witness who would express such opinion by simply allowing

4

the prosecutor to take the stand and testify for the

5

witness.
In this particular case, the prosecutor, serving

6
7

as the surrogate for young Nicholas Christopher, a young

8

— youngster for whom this jury undoubtedly had the most

9

heartfelt and deepest sympathy, serving as the

10

representative of the State, did three improper things.

11

He, first of all, demanded Payne's execution because --

12

for young Nicholas' sake.

13

14

offender.

15

psychological intimidation of the worst kind.

Secondly, he suggested to the

And thirdly, he engaged in a form of

He strongly —

17

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, Mr. Lathram, that

18

the jury's feeling of sympathy or perhaps outrage at the

19

crime and what it's left the victims with is not a

20

permissible factor at all?

21

MR. LATHRAM:

Oh, not at all, Your Honor.

22

Certainly the jury is going to have the most heartfelt

23

sympathy for this youngster and should.

24
25

QUESTION:

And outrage, presumably, if the facts

are proven against the defendant.

MR. LATHRAM:

1

Certainly, Your Honor, I think

2

they would definitely have outrage.

3

they had already convicted him.

4

QUESTION:

And at this point,

So certainly —

They have outrage, but do you say

5

they may not take that into account in deciding the

6

penalty?

7

MR. LATHRAM:

No, Your Honor, I'm not saying

8

that at all.

9

into account, and are entitled to.

I think that they certainly would take that

What we say is the error here — it would have

11

been wrong, for example, Your Honor, for the grandmother

12

to take the stand and actually testify to the opinion, I

13

would like to see Pervis Payne executed.

14

token, we think that the prosecutor cannot get up and

15

start off his argument to the jury and say at the very

16

conclusion, there is one thing, however, you can do for

17

young Nicholas Christopher, and then go on to say that the

18

little boy when he grows up is going to demand a

19

particular type of justice.

20

what type of justice was done in this case.

21

By the same

He's going to want to know

Just as it would be wrong to call a witness to

22

the stand and say I think that the defendant should be

23

executed, by the same token, I respectfully submit, that

24

it's even worse, under the particular circumstances of

25

this case, to have the prosecutor testify for the little

boy.

QUESTION:

So suppose a juror said in the jury

3

room, you know, some day I might meet this young man

4

young infant — 5, 10 years down the road, and I am very

5

concerned about what kind of justice is done.

6

we should impose a death penalty.

7

for a mistrial, if the juror said that in the jury room?
MR. LATHRAM:

And I think

Would that be grounds

Your Honor, I don't think so

because I don't think we can impeach the verdict.

I don't

think we'd be able to —
QUESTION:

11

Well, let's take the hypothetical.

12

Let's assume that we have this testimony in a State where

13

you can impeach the verdict.

the juror?

15

MR. LATHRAM:

Is that improper conduct for

I don't think the jury should

16

consider it, but I don't think it would raise a problem

17

for this reason.

18

The juror is thinking on his own.

In this case, we have the representative of the

19

State telling the jury that they may take this into

20

account and actually execute this man for this

21

impermissible reason.
«

22

QUESTION:

Well, if jurors can and will and do,

23

take certain matters of elementary justice into account,

24

it seems to me proper that prosecutors be able to argue

25

about it under the supervision of the court, subject to

1

the rebuttal by the defense counsel, and that it is just

2

only realistic to allow this sort of argument.

3

MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, I think that we must

4

presume that the jury is going to follow its instructions.

5

And there is nothing — and the jury is told that it is

6

supposed to apply the collective conscience of the 12 of

7

them, and they're to base that collective judgment on the

8

basis of the evidence and on the basis of the law.

9

QUESTION:

And —

Well, and I submit that a juror could

10

say I'm concerned about what would happen if I would meet

11

this young man or members of his family 5, 10 years down

12

the line.

13

kind of justice that we hand out because we have to look

14

at things in the long term.

15

perfectly appropriate.

16

MR. LATHRAM:

I think that's an appropriate measure of the

It seems to me that's

Your Honor, it — I would

17

respectfully disagree, Your Honor.

18

my point across by asking ourselves this rhetorical

19

question.

20

want the defendant executed for religious reasons or

21

whatever?

22

think that an otherwise heinous murderer would be

23

considered to be less blameworthy or less deserving of the

24

death penalty just because the victim's survivor felt

25

contrary to the way most survivors would feel.

And perhaps I can get

What if a survivor in a particular case did not

QUESTION:

It's funny you should mention that.

I was about to ask you what if the defense in a trial
wants to put on the mother of the victim to testify, you
know, I've suffered more loss than anyone in this case,
and I hope you won't put this poor person to death.

Must

that be excluded?
MR. LATHRAM:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it must

be excluded.
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. LATHRAM:

I do believe that, Your Honor.

I

think the trial court would have to exclude that evidence.
I think that —
QUESTION:

I thought any mitigating evidence —

this is mitigating evidence offered by the defense.
MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, to me — I would

respectfully submit that this is an arbitrary variable
that — I can't imagine anything more arbitrary than to
allow an offender's fate to depend upon the opinion of the
survivor.

I think that the mere fortuity that a survivor

wants, for religious or whatever reasons, wants the victim
— excuse me, the defendant to be spared, injects a
completely arbitrary factor into the sentencing
determination.
QUESTION:

Well, how about his fate depending on

1

the fact that he had an unhappy childhood?

2

MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, I think that

3

certainly, as this Court has held, I certainly think that

4

that constitutes mitigating evidence, because that is

5

something that the jury can take into account when it

6

assesses his character.

7

things that the jury can assess in determining whether or

8

not he should live or die.

9

His character is one of the

But the mere fortuity that a victim's survivor

10

feels one way or the other about whether the defendant

11

should be executed, I respectfully submit — first, let's

12

look at it in terms of retribution because retribution is

13

a valid penological objective.

14

question.

15

victim's survivor does not want the defendant executed.

16

Would society's interest in retribution, which after all,

17

is a punishment for an injury to society as a whole, be

18

any less diminished?

19

Let's ask ourselves this

Let's assume that we have a situation where the

I would think not.

I would think that society's interest in

20

retribution is just as strong, even if one of the

21

survivors comes in and says, I'm a very religious
person
o

22

and I don't believe in the death penalty and I don't want

23

this man being executed.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know.

You know one of

the purposes of retribution was to prevent people from

1

taking law into their own hands.

2

an the State's punishment simply substitutes for what used

3

to be called "weregild," where the person doing the injury

4

would pay money to the family of the person harmed, and

5

things of that sort.

6

thinks about the matter on that theory would be very

7

important.

8

9

You go all the way back

What the family of the person harmed

Certainly one of the purposes is to prevent
people from taking justice into their own hands, saying

10

the State will avenge you; you need not avenge yourselves.

11

And if the person comes forward and says, I don't want to

12

be avenged, is that totally irrelevant?

13

MR. LATHRAM:

I think it is, Your Honor, because

14

again, I think retribution is a punishment for an injury

15

to society as a whole.

16

determines that particular conduct is so heinous that it

17

makes someone death eligible, that the defendant should

18

not be allowed escape execution simply because of the mere

19

fortuity that there is a relative out there that some

20

defense lawyer can find who will come in and say, well,

21

maybe I don't really want him dead after all.

QUESTION:

This hasn't got anything to do with

Booth, has it?
MR. LATHRAM:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it does

for this reason.

12

whether or not a defendant should be executed.

13

Booth dealt with a case where the survivors actually came

14

in and testified, or testified through the VIS statement,

15

here, I would respectfully submit, that we have something

16

that is the equivalent of, and indeed much worse than,

such testimony.

the other prosecutor, at the very end of her rebuttal,

submit, that the intent here, was to inject as much

prejudice into this sentencing trial as possible.
But what he did here is at the very close, he

12

said, "But there is something you can do

13

for Nicholas.

14

to grow up, hopefully," and then he goes on to say,

15

going to want to know what type of justice was done."

16

he certainly, I respectfully submit, was not suggesting to

17

the jury that they go back to the jury room and think

18

seriously about imposing a life sentence.

MR. LATHRAM:

some other things I certainly want to talk about, but —
QUESTION:

Mr. Lathram, I'm just wondering if

6

that statement that Nicholas is going to want to know what

7

type of justice was done, isn't the most natural response

8

in the world.

9

that a survivor some day is going to wonder what happened

10
11

Do you think that any juror would not know

to the perpetrator of the crime?
I mean, this isn't telling the jurors something

12

they don't know.

13

if that is the most prejudicial thing that happened, then

14

I'm wondering if there was, indeed, any prejudice.

15

I find it hard to see how that could —

MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, I would like to think

16

that when a juror brought this up during the course of

17

deliberations, that the other jurors would say, we're

18

supposed to decide whether this man lives or dies on the

19

basis of the evidence in the case and the instructions

20

given to us from the Court.

QUESTION:

Was there an objection made at the

time that this came in?

matter of constitutional law, that a new sentencing

MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, Payne's counsel at —

3

in the two State proceedings did not object to this.

4

However —

5

QUESTION:

It just seems to me it's exactly the

6

kind of thing that if there were any question about it,

7

that if an objection were made at the time, the trial

8

judge could make some kind of statement to the jury and

9

tell them to disregard any opinion testimony, if that's

10
11
12

what the State law required.
But to come back later and say there's some
constitutional violation strikes me as —

13

MR. LATHRAM:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LATHRAM:

Well, Your Honor --

— strange.
Excuse me, Your Honor.

State law

16

did not require that.

17

on appeal, and this Federal issue was, indeed, decided by

18

the Tennessee Supreme Court.

19

we have now on the books is a Tennessee decision which

20

will be precedent for other offenders in Tennessee.

21

therefore, I don't that the failure to object would

22

prevent this Court from dealing with it.

Is a prosecutor forbidden any poetic

license at all in his argument?

13

to use some analogies and some examples.

that he simply may never leave the cold record, even in

MR. LATHRAM:

Are you saying

No, Your Honor, I'm not.

What

18

we're saying here is that this prosecutor told this jury

19

they could do something that this Court has never even

20

intimated, much less held could be done.

told the jury that, ladies and gentlemen, you may execute

to say how Nicholas is going to grow up and he says,

MR. LATHRAM:

11

I thing what the court held was

that there may have been a Booth violation.

I think that's — again, the opinion is

not really a model of clarity.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lathram, suppose he hadn't

MR. LATHRAM:

Yes, Your Honor, because what

they're asking — I can't think of — again, I know I'm

being somewhat repetitious, but to me, there's nothing

20

more arbitrary than to allow a person's fate to depend

21

upon the opinion of a single survivor.

22

QUESTION:

Why isn't it arbitrary to have it

depend on the opinion of the community or my perception of

prosecutors often tell the jury, you are the conscience of

the community.

Retribution is something for society, not for a particular

That gets back to my point on retribution.

would want this person executed.

15

argument's okay, I don't know why that isn't just as

arbitrary, as you put it.

And this community is a hard-hat

MR. LATHRAM:

Now, that kind

This Court, Your Honor — and I

18

think this will respond to it -- this Court has, I think,

19

in Booth and the majority opinion — and again, I'm

20

separating this survivor opinion away from the victim

21

impact, which I'm going to come to in just a minute — but

22

this Court has never intimated, and in fact, all the State

23

courts' decisions, I believe, and this is, I think,

24

brought out in the Huertas argument, have indicated that

25

it's improper for a survivor to express an opinion.

And it's — if I'm not mistaken, and I could be

2

because I don't know the Huertas record as well as,

3

perhaps, I should, but I think that went back to Ohio on a

Now, that's Ohio State Law,

I agree.

How many States do permit

Frankly, I find it extraordinary to have
But that's quite separate from the question

10

of whether it's constitutional if a State wants to do

11

that.

12

How many States do do it, do you know?
MR. LATHRAM:

No, Your Honor.

I would, and I'm

13

going to go out on a limb here, but I would venture to say

14

that no State does.

15

up on that.

16

And I do think it rises to an Eighth Amendment violation

17

because, again, the best way to answer it is to — is to

18

focus on the what would happen if the victim's survivor

19

said, I don't want him killed.

20

But I don't have anything to back me

I just can't imagine any State allowing it.

To me, the guy is just as heinous and the need

21

for retribution is just a great, notwithstanding the fact

22

that a defense lawyer is able to go out and find one

23

witness who can come in and say, well, gosh, I have some

problems about the death penalty.

MR. LATHRAM:

I think what the Court said, I

respectfully submit, that what the Court said in Lockett

8

was that all relevant mitigating evidence must come in.

don't think the Court has ever said that anything a

come into evidence.

in that situation, Your Honor, society, working through

submit, is that we're letting the decision on whether or

the legislature has not given any definition to and --

MR. LATHRAM:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, then how can you pretend that

5

the legislature has set some rigorous penalty that

6

mathematically follows?

7

MR. LATHRAM:

Well, in the first hypothetical,

8

all the jury is called upon to do is, first, determine

9

whether a death occurred.

Usually that's going to be

10

stipulated, or that there won't be any dispute about that.

11

The jury doesn't go along — doesn't after that then

decide, well, I think death should be imposed because the

victim who was killed in this case happens to be a person

14

who was well loved by his family members.

them.

MR. LATHRAM:

Your Honor, it's inconceivable to

me, and perhaps — maybe it should be conceivable, but

it's inconceivable to me that a defense lawyer could come

in and say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've got

sentencing process that the Eighth Amendment prohibits.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lathram, let me make two

suggestions and get your responses to them.

11

that whether or not the person is a saint or a reprobate,

12

and whether or not the jury is told about it really isn't

any more — doesn't inject anything more arbitrary than

15

to me.

16

that they may cause death.

17

that if he performs them, the victim may be a saint.

The second suggestion is this.

Isn't the real

20

problem with getting into the — or at least with the

MR. LATHRAM:

I think that's correct, Your

Honor, and I think that that is the point that we made in

the first part of our reply brief in this case.

that when society, speaking through its legislature, has a

6

valid governmental interest for making a classification,

whether based on harm or based on victim status, such as

the peace officer.

society is worth more than another.

QUESTION:

14

MR. LATHRAM:

Is that an Eighth Amendment concern?
Yes, Your Honor, I think it is

because it injects, again, an arbitrary factor that I

think would run afoul of Furman —

QUESTION:

The valuation itself is an arbitrary

factor because it is insupportable.
MR. LATHRAM:

Yes, sir, it's the nonspecificity

MR. BURSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

flawed propositions that victim impact information may be

8

unrelated to any legitimate sentencing consideration, that

9

its inherently emotional appeal will shift the focus of

10

the sentencer to irrelevant factors, and that in so

11

shifting the focus of the sentencer, it will result in the

12

arbitrary imposition of the sentence.

13

It's the State's position that the full extent

14

of harm done is relevant to the personal responsibility

15

and moral guilt of the defendant.

16

characterization of the victim is necessary to enable the

you at that point because, taking the other side of the

clearest example is, if we look, and I kind of hate to use

this example, if we look at the President and we look at a

doesn't relate directly to anything the legislature has

said.

MR. THORNBURGH:

I think that our position is

that in order for the jury to hold the defendant fully

10

accountable for the extent of the harm that's been

11

inflicted upon the victim, its — his or her family or

12

their community, that that kind of evidence is properly

13

received as a constitutional matter.

14

infirm under the Eighth Amendment about receiving that

15

information.

16

QUESTION:

There is nothing

Well, then why wouldn't evidence as

17

to the unsavory nature of the victim be relevant as far as

18

the defendant's case is concerned?

19

MR. THORNBURGH:

20
21

I'm suggesting that that,

again, is a matter for State law and there is nothing -—
QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking you though, in the

22

absence of State law, because I suspect in many of these

23

situations, we don't have a directly relevant State law.

24

We're going to have prosecutors and defense counsel out

25

there wondering what to do and how far they can go.

MR. THORNBURGH:

QUESTION:

3

And I'm just wondering what your

theory is.

My own sense --

MR. THORNBURGH:

My own sense is that the

defense counsel should not be permitted to denigrate the

6

value of the life that already has found to have been

7

taken under circumstances justifying death sentence

8

eligibility.

9

been taken are admissible to give the jury the full

That the characteristics of the life that's

10

picture of the nature and extent of the harm that's been

11

caused by the defendant's act so that they can hold that

12

defendant fully accountable to the full extent of the harm

13

that's been done to the family and the community and the

14

like.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, how about pure opinion

testimony of a survivor as to the penalty?
MR. THORNBURGH:

Opinion testimony, again, I

18

don't think, as a constitutional matter, should be barred.

19

Again, I'm not terribly sure that if I were drafting the

20

legislation that provided for these kinds of situations,

21

that that would be at the top of the list.

22

constitutional matter, I don't see any infirmity in having

23

that opinion on either side presented.

QUESTION:

But as a

But the full extent -- I mean, once a

man is sentenced to death, what else can you do to him?

MR. THORNBURGH:

QUESTION:

So, you don't — full extent doesn't

help in this case, does it?
MR. THORNBURGH:

4
5

Nothing.

Justice Marshall, what I am

trying to convey is a sense —
QUESTION:

6

Well, what I'm trying to convey is

7

that you — this case, they showed everything necessary to

8

bring in a death penalty.

9

MR. THORNBURGH:

And then they added this on.
We would suggest that in making

10

the determination as to whether a death penalty eligible

11

defendant is to, in fact, suffer the death penalty, it's

12

important for the jury to have the full picture of the

13

harm that was caused by the act which took the life of the

14

victim.

15
16

QUESTION:

And anything in addition you can

think of.

17

MR. THORNBURGH:

Not anything in addition you

18

can think of, because a trial judge has and exercises the

19

opportunity —
QUESTION:

20

Well, do you agree with me that there

21

was enough there without that — the bloodied pictures, et

22

cetera?

MR. THORNBURGH:

I didn't try the case, so I

24

wouldn't want to make that judgment.

That's right.

MR. THORNBURGH:

That's right.

QUESTION:

And we have to go this -- we have to

go this one step further and overrule Booth?

MR. THORNBURGH:

There is another factor, I think, that we have

Yes, we are.

10

to deal with here, and legitimately.

11

about particular cases where the risks posed by potential

12

inflammatory or prejudicial evidence may be offered.

13

we are suggesting that those can be accommodated by the

14

kinds of safety valves that exist in the conduct of the

case.

process, which offers a chance for that judgment to be

clarified.

There are concerns

Judges are used to making those decisions with

But what we are suggesting is that it is

20

inappropriate to have a constitutional rule, per se, which

21

excludes all of the evidence with respect to what the

22

impact on the victim, the victim's family, and the

23

victim's community was.

We suggest, also, that this per se rule is
really unworkable in practice because some —

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Attorney General, do you

2

understand that per se rule to apply to a matter that the

defendant knew about, or are we only talk about a matter

4

the defendant could not have reasonably foreseen?
MR. THORNBURGH:

culpability is on matters that the defendant knew about.

Clearly, the highest case of

QUESTION:

But you don't understand Booth to

exclude that evidence?

9

MR. THORNBURGH:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. THORNBURGH:

No.

Oh, okay.
But what we're saying is that

12

in order to assess the full impact of the act that the

13

defendant carried out and to hold that defendant fully

14

accountable, it's necessary to go beyond the ambit of

15

simply what that defendant knew and to take into account

16

the actual impact so that the jury has the full picture.

17

QUESTION:

General Thornburgh, do you agree with

18

General Burson that there are really two different sorts

19

of victim impact evidence and that both can get in?

20

mean, one is really an aggravating, you know, he was the

21

father of 10 children who will miss him, and their lives

22

will be harder because he's gone, and therefore; society

is harmed.

MR. THORNBURGH:

4

QUESTION:

5

Would both types be admissible in

your view?
MR. THORNBURGH:

6

Let me, if I might Justice

7

Scalia, recast that dichotomy, because I think there is

8

entirely too much focus upon the characteristics, per se.

9

But those characteristics have relevance only insofar as

10

they reflect the actual harm that was done by the criminal

11

act for which everyone agrees we must hold this defendant

12

accountable.

13

Let me recast that —

It's not the characteristics, themselves but

14

what has resulted from the death of that individual in a

15

loss to the victim, the family, and the community.

16

think it would be inadmissible, and no one supports the

17

proposition that in these considerations, the

18

characteristics, themselves, should govern the

determination.

the loss that was suffered by the criminal act carried

out, that they are inadmissible -- are admissible.
