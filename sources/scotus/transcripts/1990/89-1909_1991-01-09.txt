ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ,

13

MR. KNOBBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the copyrightability of a

14

phone subscriber's name, address, and telephone number as

15

published by the phone company in its directory.

16

effect of the decisions below, which came from the

17

district of Kansas in the Tenth Circuit, is to hold that a

18

private company cannot publish these facts in its own

19

directory without first doing a canvas to obtain the facts

20

from the phone subscriber.

21

The

Our position is that while the telephone

22

company's directory may be copyrightable as a whole, the

23

phone company's alphabetical list of names, address, and

24

telephone numbers of its subscribers is not a work of

25

authorship under the statute, Section 101 of the copyright

act.

And that even if the alphabetical list of

2

subscribers was somehow copyrightable as a whole, that

copyright doesn't extend any protection to the preexisting

facts in the list — the name, address, and telephone

To briefly explain the facts, the easiest way to

7

understand them is, if you look at the joint appendix,

8

about five pages from the back, on page 93, there's a

colored map.

Okay.

If you were in Spearville, Kansas, where

13

Feist started out and you wanted to call your county seat,

14

Dodd City, Kansas, to check on your property taxes, you

15

couldn't find the number in your directory because your

What Feist's idea was to put — was to put all

QUESTION:

Well, good idea.

2

MR. KNOBBE:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. KNOBBE:

Thank you, Your Honor.

To do that — what Feist did was

5

went to the various phone companies here and licensed

6

their updated white page listings so he could print those

7

in the directory.

8

is he didn't necessarily just license the directory.

9

licensed updated, white page listings, the information

10

Now, one thing that's important to note
He

that's available to the directory operator..
The reason for that is, for example, if you look

11

12

on the map, the directory that covers the green area in

13

the lower left-hand corner, that directory may have came

14

in February.

15

the top may have came out in November.

The directory that covers the red area up in

16

Now a Feist directory that covers the whole area

17

comes out in December, then the listings from the red area

18

that came out in November, those will be fairly current.

19

But the listings from this green area down here, if your

20

looking solely at the directory, are almost a year out of

21

date.

22

QUESTION:

Counsel, did Feist leave in its

23

directory the listings broken down by the areas you're

24

showing or did it recompile the list into one giant

25

alphabetical list?

QUESTION:

MR. KNOBBE:

Uh-huh.
— in Feist's directory you still

10

looked under the B's till you got to Blow. .Now, if you

11

wanted to call Joe Blow and you were sure of where he

12

lived.

13

weren't sure — it's up in there somewhere — you could

14

still go alphabetically to look for Blow.

He may have lived in Jennings or Decatur — you

Yes, it would show the town, Your

Honor.

11

QUESTION:

And so that had to be added, I take

12

it, to the listing that was in the phone directory,

MR. KNOBBE:

No, Your Honor, that's —
— after each address.
I wish it were so, but that's

incorrect.

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNOBBE:

All right.
The phone — the phone company's

Well, let me ask the question this

What are the — are there any differences between

each individual listing in the Feist directory and in the
phone book directory?
MR. KNOBBE:

Yes, there are approximately 3,800

— there are 4,935 listings that are potentially
duplicates.

And there are 3,800 of them are different.

Some of the differences are in address to the extent of
this.

MR. CAPLINGER:

Your Honor, I'm not sure what

10

the company did.

I think that for their service, since

11

this company — it's a nonprofit coop and it's owned by

12

its members, they would take whatever steps, copyrightable

13

or not copyrightable, to provide an up-to-date, accurate

14

telephone directory.

But it —

QUESTION:

Sure, because they want people to use

the service.
MR. CAPLINGER:

That's right.

But it would be

18

disturbing and it would turn the Federal copyright law as

19

directories straight up on top of its head is — if

20

somebody is allowed to wait until somebody puts out a

21

compilation and then say, well, all we have to do -- all

22

we have to do is dump that information into our computer

23

and we'll rearrange it with the stroke of a computer key

24

and then we'll copyright it ourselves.

MR. CAPLINGER:

Well, we — there is —

You're trying to use your copyright

on the white pages to protect your business — the

business interest in the advertising in the yellow pages.

10

That's what's at stake here, isn't it?
MR. CAPLINGER:

11

Well, there is revenue produced

from the white page listings.

that.

QUESTION;

But isn't the problem under 103(b)

and the problem for the sweat-of-the-brow theory that it

provides that the protection extends only to the material

something about the content of the work?

I'm talking about the phrase that

Well, Justice Souter, I think

you have to go back.

There's what is known as collective work, and that's

what's at issue here, and then there's a derivative work.

And a derivative work is where — and this might sound

MR. CAPLINGER:

That's true, and you go back to

That's where a second publisher took the alphabetized
