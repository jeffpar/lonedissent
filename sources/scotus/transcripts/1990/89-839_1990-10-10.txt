MRS. JARRETT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents two separate issues, a

11

voluntariness issue regarding a confession and a harmless

12

error issue.

QUESTION:

Will we need to decide both?

MRS. JARRETT:

I do not know if the Court will

need to decide both of these, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, you win if we decide either one

of them your w^iy.

18

MRS.1JARRETT:

That is correct.

19

I will be addressing the voluntariness issue,

20

and Mr. Larkin from the Solicitor General's office will be

21

addressing the harmless error issue.

22

At Oreste Fulminante's trial for first-degree

23

murder, two separate confessions were introduced to him

24

over his objection.

25

made while he was incarcerated in a Federal prison.

The first was a confession that he

He

made the first confession to a fellow inmate, who was in

reality an FBI informant.

The second confession Mr. Fulminante made was 6

months after the first one.

On direct appeal,

Fulminante had been

convicted of first-degree murder, on his direct appeal, he

protection.

QUESTION:

He claimed in the

In examining that issue, did the

8

Arizona -- was the Arizona Supreme Court confined just to

9

the suppression motion that the judge ruled on or could it

10

and should it also take into account the evidence that

11

might have been given at trial on the point?

12

MRS. JARRETT:

The court did consider the

13

evidence at trial,

14

court to do so.

1.5

of Arizona law, whether it's constitutionally required or

16

not, has looked to the entire trial record in determining

17

whether a confession is coerced.

The Arizona court has always,

And if we hear that issue, we look at

That is correct, Your Honor.

I

believe it would be proper for this court to also examine

only deference that this Court owes to the Arizona Supreme

Court regarding the coerced confession is to the facts,

the underlying facts that the Arizona Supreme Court found

in regard to the confession.

confession was actually coerced is a matter of Federal

QUESTION:

The question whether the

But that court drew some inferences

10

from the trial court record and on that basis made its

11

finding of coercion.

12

that, don't you think?

It's a little hard for us to undo

MRS. JARRETT:

13

Your Honor, I respectfully

14

disagree, and one reason I disagree is that the Arizona

15

court determined as a matter of fact that Fulminante was

16

in danger while in prison.

17

the record.

18

from Sarivola's trial testimony, is that it is possibly a

19

prison — or a prisoner who is known to have killed a

20

child or be a child murderer would be in danger while in

21

prison.

22

And this is not borne out by

The only evidence in the record, and this is

This was not a stipulated fact that was before

23

the trial judge when he made his finding, and there is

24

simply no evidence in the regarding that particular fact,

25

so that is why the State contends that the Arizona's

1

court's finding of involuntariness is based in a large

2

part upon its finding that this promise of protection was

3

so incredibly coercive because Mr. Fulminante was in

4

actual danger while it was in prison.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I thought that Sarivola said

6

that his name that — he was going to be carried out

7

horizontally and so forth?

8

MRS. JARRETT:

That is a portion of the record.

9

That was not part of the evidence before the trial judge.

10

A portion of his interview with the defense counsel prior

11

to trial was attached to one of the pleadings, and he did

12

speculate in that particular portion of the interview that

13

that was his feeling.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But that was not recounted again at

trial?
MRS. JARRETT:

No.

The defense attorney at

17

trial never asked him whether Mr. Fulminante was in actual

18

danger or asked him his feelings about the danger to

19

Fulminante.

20

remote possibility was that there was a stipulated fact

21

that Fulminante had been receiving some sort of rough

22

treatment and what-not is the phrase Sarivola used from

23

the other prisoners, but no one ever asked Fulminante or

24

Sarivola what this rough treatment consisted of.

25

record is just unclear on that.

And the only evidence that there was even a

And the

But in any event, he — Fulminante did not ask

1
2

Sarivola for protection.

3

in need of protection, and even after Sarivola made this

4

offer of protection to him, he merely told him about the

5

murder during their casual conversation without saying now

6

are you going to help me?

7

He never indicated that he was

So, that is the reason that I believe that this

8

Court should not defer to the Arizona Supreme Court's

9

finding of the law in regard to the voluntariness without

10

first reexamining the record to see if there is any

11

evidence of actual danger to Fulminante.
QUESTION:

12

Mrs. Jarrett, you concede, however,

13

that the FBI informant, before the -- immediately before

14

the conversation at which the confession was made, did

15

refer to the fact that the defendant had been receiving

16

hard treat -- he heard the defendant had been receiving

17

hard treatment from other inmates and that he could

18

protect him from that, but if he — if he wanted such

19

protection, he'd have to be open with him about

20

everything.
MRS. JARRETT:

21
22

Honor.
QUESTION:

1

Honor.
In regard to the State's contention that the

2
3

Arizona court not only ruled incorrectly on the

4

involuntariness issue, it is the State's contention that

5

the court actually applied an incorrect standard in ruling

6

on the voluntariness issue.

7

promise resulting in a confession and stated that it was a

8

coerced confession without ever examining one of the most

9

important facts or one of the most important circumstances

The court in effect found a

10

in the case, whether Fulminante was a person whose will

11

could easily be overborne by a promise of promise of

12

protection.

13

When Fulminante's character is examined it is

14

very clear that he is not such a person.

15

this admission to Sarivola, he went into great detail

16

about the terrible way in which he had killed his young

17

stepdaughter, and he used the phrase that he had clipped

18

her.

19

anything of that nature.

20

there's a finding by the Arizona court that, and this is

21

in appendix to the petition at A76, the trial court found

22

in its special verdict in this matter that these were the

23

statements of a man who was bragging and relishing the

24

crime committed.

That is correct.

So there's no inconsistency there, is

there?

10

MRS. JARRETT:

11

QUESTION:

12

MRS. JARRETT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Yeah.
It was in connection with that.

13

In looking at one of the most important factors in

14

determining whether Fulminante's state of mind was such

15

that he could have been coerced by a promise into

16

confessing, the court has to look not only at the fact

17

that he did confess in response to the promise but at his

18

characteristics.

19

And, as noted in the briefs, he's a middle-aged

20

sociopath.

He's low- to low-average —■

or low-to-average

intelligence.

problems that would have made him especially susceptible

I — that didn't

QUESTION:

There is no dispute about the fact

7

that everybody seemed to understand the informant was in a

8

position through his connections or otherwise to provide

9

protection to somebody who might otherwise be violently

10

treated by inmates, isn't that right?

11

MRS. JARRETT:

12

QUESTION:

13

MRS. JARRETT:

Yes, he was.

Yeah.
Going back to Mr. Fulminante's

14

characteristics.

He had been in prison before.

This was

15

the third time he was in prison.

16

convictions and, interestingly enough, the first time he

17

was in prison as a young man at age 26, when he felt fear

18

of other inmates, all he did was ask to be put in

19

protective custody and it was done.

20

nothing to indicate that if he was actually in fear, he

21

could have done that in this case.

22

authorities were apparently aware that he was receiving

23

any kind of treatment, or this rough treatment was

24

certainly not bad enough that he would complain to

25

authorities.

MRS. JARRETT:

None of them were taped, Your

Honor.

Sarivola was not wearing a mike.

They were — they were made in the prison.

QUESTION:

Then on rehearing, the Supreme Court

4

of Arizona said that the admission of a involuntary

confession can't be harmless error, and so they reversed

-- I suppose they didn't have to go back under that line

of reasoning and decide again whether the second

confession was the fruit of a poisonous tree.

admission of the first confession made the — the judgment

infirm — or the verdict infirm.
MRS. JARRETT:

It did, however, the court did

12

look at that question again, because it was raised in the

13

defendant's motion for reconsideration and the court in

14

its second — in its supplemental opinion specifically

15

rejected that claim again, saying none of his other claims

16

are any good, just this one regarding harmless error.

The rule of automatic reversal applied by the

1
2

Arizona Supreme Court in this case is an anachronism.

3

was adopted at a time when rules of automatic reversal

4

were the only ones known to the law.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LARKIN:

It

Is it the law?
It is.

It is still the law today.

7

In that respect the Arizona Supreme Court was correct.

8

The Arizona Supreme Court initially ruled that it was

9

legally permissible to find that the error in this case

10

was factually harmless.

11

only the first half of that ruling.

12

to page C2 in the petition appendix, the Arizona Supreme

13

Court lists all the claims that were made in the rehearing

14

petition.

15

factually harmless and that, as my colleague has pointed

16

out, was among the claims that was rejected on rehearing.

17

So what we have before you then, Your Honor, is

18

a case in which the only reason the Arizona Supreme Court

19

held this error to be prejudicial was it felt that this

20

Court's precedence foreclosed it from giving effect to its

21

finding that the error was harmless as a factual matter.

22

Since Chapman v. California 20 years ago first

On reconsideration they changed
In fact, if you look

One of them was that the error was not

23

held that harmless error analysis can apply to

24

constitutional violations, this Court has often made clear

that the harmless error doctrine is in fact the rule and

speaking, is the exact opposite of where the law stood in

1897 when the Bram case was decided.

4

The law, therefore, generally-

It is Bram in fact that is the source of the

rule that the Arizona Supreme Court invoked in this case

MR. LARKIN:

Why?
But on that issue, the first issue

22

in this case, what they treated as decisive, was the fact

that there was an offer of protection made and they

24

treated as dispositive, the ruling in the other half of

1

type, a confession is necessarily involuntary.

2

actually the Arizona Supreme Court invoked both halves of

3

the Bram decision in this case to upset the conviction,

4

the first half being that any offer renders a statement

5

involuntary, the second half being that any involuntary

6

statement has to require a reversal.

7

So

Now, interestingly, neither Respondent nor

8

supporting amicus defends the rationale given in the Bram

9

case for that rule, and we think they're right not to do

10

so.

Bram rested on a perceived logical contradiction

11

between the propositions that a particular item of

12

evidence could be at once probative and yet harmless.
In fact today, under modern principles of

The question then becomes whether there is

Do you think that that's why Bram

reached that conclusion or did it see the logical

contradiction in every case?

10

MR. LARKIN:

Well, Bram didn't have before it

the rule that harmless errors could be overlooked.
QUESTION:

11

I recognize that, but we're talking

12

about the logical contradiction that the Court thought

13

that it saw in Bram.

14

confession was the only piece of evidence?

15

MR. LARKIN:

Did it see that just because the

No, I think it saw it because any

16

piece of evidence, whether or not it was a confession,

17

would lead to that type of contradiction.

18

they — the Court in Bram thought that it was

19

contradictory for a prosecutor to argue to the trial court

20

that this evidence proves the defendant is guilty and then

21

argue to an appellate court that the same evidence doesn't

22

prove he's guilty or at least didn't have any prejudicial

23

effect because there was plenty of other evidence in the

case.

be sure that I get it, that if the -- this case were

retried without the Sarivola confession admitted that all

3

the other evidence admitted, you can say that -- the judge

4

would state beyond a reasonable doubt that the man would

5

MR. LARKIN:

6

Yes.

We think the error in this

case was factually harmless and that the Court in this

case should use this vehicle for saying that errors like

if that's what you're getting at then I would certainly

agree.

QUESTION:

Well, not only that, but if you lose

on retrial and if the evidence is excluded, in every case

we would be able to say beyond a reasonable doubt he would

QUESTION:

But there's no

There's no indication

Do you think that's what they mean by

a rough time in prison?

They call you names?

(Laughter.)

MRS. JARRETT:

10

Well, Your Honor, there's nothing

11

in the record to indicate otherwise in this case, and it's

certainly did not deter Fulminante from taking his evening

QUESTION:

With his friend Sarivola?

15

MRS. JARRETT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

he had truly been in danger, he would have perhaps been

QUESTION:

I don't know.

If

Do you think that if

QUESTION:

-- he apparently felt perfectly safe

MRS. JARRETT:

Well, Your Honor, I'm saying that

he had a choice if he's -- to a — he could have continued

to deny that he committed this crime.

14

QUESTION:

15

MRS. JARRETT:

Right.

He had the choice.

He's not compelled to confess to
