CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

United States.

Mr. Goldblatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GOLDBLATT!

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a Federal sentencing guidelines case.

12

Mr. Burns was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment,

13

although the judge, the presentence investigator, and the

14

parties all agree that the appropriate guideline range for

15

the case is 30 to 37 months' imprisonment.

16

Neither the parties or the presentence

17

investigator identified any grounds that might justify

18

departure from the appropriate guideline range as that

19

terms is defined by statute.

20

was imposed, however, that the judge indicated that she

21

disagreed with that assessment and in fact found at least

22

three grounds which did justify departure.

23

point immediately imposed sentence of 60 months'

24

imprisonment and directed the defendant to step back with

25

the marshal.

It was not until sentence

She at that

1

The issue that is before the Court today is
\

2

whether or not the judge was obliged to alert the parties

3

that she had found three grounds for departure that no one

4

had identified so as to allow comment on whether or not

5

departure was appropriate before sentence was imposed.

6

We make this argument both under rule 32(a)(1)

7

of the Federal rules of criminal procedure and,

8

alternatively, as a matter of fundamental due process.

9

Rule 32(a)(1) was amended at the same time that

10

Congress passed the Sentence Reform Act of 1984 to provide

11

as follows, and I will quote for this purpose.

12

sentencing hearing the court shall afford counsel for the

13

defendant and the attorney for the Government an

14

opportunity to comment upon the probation officer's

15

determination and on other matters relating to the

16

appropriate sentence."

17

"At the

The court goes on to provide that the court

18

shall also afford counsel for both sides and the defendant

19

the opportunity to address the court.

20

that under the circumstances presented here, where the

21

judge is the only person who has identified grounds for

22

departure, that the judge must alert the parties to that

23

fact, otherwise the court is not affording the parties the

24

opportunity to comment on a matter that is very much

25

relating to the appropriate sentence.

It is our argument

1

Mr. Goldblatt, I would have thought

that every defendant would be on notice that a judge could

give a sentence any place within the range, that it could

be enhanced or otherwise.

7

I mean, the sentencing scheme

Why isn't that the kind of notice you

MR. GOLDBLATT;

Justice O'Connor, the reason

8

that I think that that notice is not adequate is because

9

the guidelines contemplate that, for most cases I would

10

submit, that the sentence should be within the guideline

11

range and that it requires unusual circumstances before

12

the judge can depart from the range which have to be

13

identified for the record and are subject to appeal.

14

It is a complex enough decision that without

15

some guidance, it would be almost impossible for a lawyer

16

to pick up the guideline manual and identify any possible

17

grounds for departure.

18

in preparing the presentence report, which the parties are

19

entitled to see — at least this part of it — is directed

20

under the rule to identify any grounds which might justify

21

departure without regard to whether the investigator

22

believes they ought to be used.

23

Thus, the presentence investigator

Thus, I would submit that in the situation where

24

that investigator says there are no grounds for departure

25

— that might justify departure — counsel truly is not on

QUESTION:

Did you take the position they were

factual inquiries that you wished to address?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, Justice Kennedy, I think we

17

acknowledge that the underlying facts that there can be

18

some debate as to whether we knew that there was a

19

substantial impairment of governmental function when none

20

was identified in the presentence report.

21

think there's any factual matter that we wish to contest

22

that the fundamental facts are incorrect.

But I don't

23

However, what we would have contested had we had

24

the opportunity -- I think it's a reasonable conclusion of

25

the record — would have been whether there were

1

reasonable grounds for departure and whether it was

2

appropriate under the circumstances and even assuming that

3

there were grounds for departure, whether or not departure

4

to the extent that the judge in fact departed, which is

5

some 42 percent over the guideline range maximum, was

6

necessary under the circumstances.

7

QUESTION:

It's somewhat paradoxical that this

8

right had not been identified, at least in our

9

jurisprudence, before the Sentencing Guidelines Act.

And

10

the Sentencing Guidelines Act now limits the district

11

court's discretion and yet you would say that we impose

12

more restrictions on how the sentencing procedures should

13

be conducted.

14

That seems paradoxical to me.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Kennedy, I would submit

15

that in this circumstance, I would -- I would — it's

16

important I think to underscore that we are not requesting

17

that the Court construe the guidelines and the rules as

18

requiring a judge in all circumstances to announce to the

19

parties that the court is considering a departure.

20

only comes up in the situation presented here where no

21

one, other than the judge, has identified grounds for

22

departure, and in fact, the presentence investigator has

23

indicated that there are none.

24

circumstance that we submit that the obligation under rule

25

1

matters relating to the appropriate sentence cannot be

2

exercised unless the court indicates in one fashion or

3

another that the court disagrees with it — other people's

4

conclusions — and that there is a ground for departure.

5

QUESTION:

Of course, under the old system,

6

following up on Justice Kennedy's question, you would have

7

perhaps a recommended sentence from either the probation

8

officer or maybe from the Government and yet the court had

9

just a complete latitude within the statutory limits.

10

one ever thought that you had to have notice as to what

11

the district court had in mind.

12

MR. GOLDBLATTs

No

Mr. Chief Justice, that is

13

correct, and I would submit that not only did anybody

14

think of it, I don't think he would have had the right.

15

But I think that's one of the things that the Congress '

16

attempted to change with guidelines sentencing.

17

There are two concepts here.

One was to

18

restrict the discretion of the district court because of

19

what Congress found to be unconscionable disparity in

20

sentencing.

21

fairness in the process that did not previously exist.

22

But also to inject a large measure of

Under rule 32(c), the defense right to access to

23

the presentence report and their right to challenge

24

matters in that report, factual — actually the right of

25

both sides to challenge it — has no parallel in previous

sentence existence in the Federal system.

2

is that under this guideline system it was changed so that

3

one of the key factors is that the parties are to have

4

meaningful participation.

5

And our point

I guess the best analogy I can draw is that if

6

the presentence investigator had identified any grounds

7

for departure, that had to go in the report.

8

the defense would have been on notice.

9

challenged the factual premises for it.

If it did,

They could have
They could have

10

prepared for the sentencing hearing and presented

11

arguments that — such as we suggested in our brief to try

12

and convince the judge that it was either inappropriate to

13

depart or, if the judge was going to report, to try and

14

reduce the amount the judge would depart.

15

That is consistent with how the guidelines are

16

supposed to operate.

Focusing, Mr. Goldblatt, focusing on

20

this case, what is there that Mr. Addis could have said to

21

Judge Johnson if he had known about her intent to depart

22

that he didn't say and that wasn't already raised in the

23

court of appeals on appeal —

here -- we have three grounds:

significant disruption of governmental function.

3

is a factor that was not considered by the guideline

4

commission at all as a grounds for departure, so it's a

5

judge-directed departure.

6

duration, concealment, and
Duration

With that, I think counsel could have argued to

7

the court that duration, in essence, is captured in the

8

guidelines because they allow the relation back to the

9

events — so in this case it was over 6 years, the

io’

duration of the crime as how it was aggregated to over

11

$1.2 million.

12

crime, I believe, to level 19 and that this really wasn't

13

something different than what the guidelines had already

14

factored into it.

15

And that's what raised the level of the

With regard to concealment, which relates to the

16

tax evasion to cover up the crime, although that is

17

covered by 5K29 of the departure grounds, it was also a

18

basis for enhancing the level of the tax fraud by two

19

levels, so it was in that sense already considered by the

20

guideline commission.

21

And with regard to significant disruption of a

22

governmental function, counsel could have and should have

23

argued that this type of disruption of a governmental

24

function is inappropriate for departure or is not required

25

since almost any crime that involves the Federal

1

Government will disrupt it in some way or another.

2

this should not be considered significant.
QUESTION;

3

And

Mr. Goldblatt, do you have to -- does

4

the judge have to be specific or does he just have to say

5

I'm going to go outside of the guidelines?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

6

Justice Marshall, I would submit

7

that what the judge would need to do would be to alert the

8

parties by indicating the grounds of the departure in
advance in such a way that the parties could comment on

10

that.

QUESTION:

Sort of a bill of particulars?

I think it would be done on a

case-by-case basis.

the crimes, the facts that they were concealed *-

11

What is the need to tell the defendant that I'm going to

This language that

MR. GOLDBLATT:

There was a statutory range, a

statutory maximum.
QUESTION:

9

And a judge would say, you know, I'm

10

giving you the maximum because I think you're a really bad

11

fellow for the following reasons, and why wouldn't it have

12

been just as necessary under the prior regime for counsel

13

who didn't know that the judge thought he was a bad fellow

14

for those reasons to be able to refute it?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

The reason, I think, Justice

16

Scalia, is before the guidelines went into effect no

17

statutory rights were created or expectation.

18

precisely because of the situation you describe, where the

19

parties had no rights at all at the proceeding to know

20

anything, that these guidelines came into effect because

21

Congress determined that sentencing as it existed in the

22

Federal system, pre-guidelines, produced unwarranted

23

disparity.

1

simply arbitrary decision making to use a reason for

2

putting somebody in prison for a longer period of time

3

that the individual has had no reason to, to address.

4

seems to me that was — if that unlawfully arbitrary under

5

this regime, it was unlawfully so under the earlier one.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

6

It

Justice Scalia, the distinction

7

I would draw there is I think that the guidelines create a

8

structure whereby the parties are entitled to participate

9

in this process to try and persuade the judge and

10

influence the decisional process.

11

we have not indeed argued on — in this appeal — that the

12

judge's decisions were unreasonable.

13

is there are alternatives that may also may be reasonable

14

and in fact are reasonable that should have been presented

15

to the court before she made her decision.

16

made her decision, and that is very much what the

17

guidelines were attempting to create.

QUESTION:

What I am suggesting

Then she would

of allocution.

21

I'm not suggesting, and

I mean you have a right to say something

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, and that appears elsewhere in the rule.

23

matter of fact, the rule goes on to say the court shall

24

also afford counsel the opportunity to address the court

As a

1

QUESTION:

So your complaint is not that you

2

don't have a right to say something, but that you weren't

3

as fully formed — informed as you should have to be able

4

to take advantage of your right to say something?

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And I would say that there's an

6

independent right to comment on matters relating to the

7

appropriate sentence beyond the other part of the rule.

8

QUESTION:

By virtue of the rule?

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

By virtue of this language that

10

was superimposed.

11

redundant or possibly even superfluous and I — again, the

12

analogy I would draw to is if the presentence investigator

13

identifies grounds for departure, counsel is guaranteed,

14

at least 10 days before imposition of sentence,

15

opportunity to prepare arguments against departure or if

16

the other side raises it, he would get the same right.

17

I mean the language is rendered

And it is anomalous to suggest that in the

18

situation where no one has identified it, where there is

19

no alerting of the parties to the possibility that

20

departure may be there, that the court should not afford

21

that opportunity but should back silently, listening to

22

argument that really has nothing to do --

process, I — the prosecution isn't advancing this claim

It's the decision maker making, making

It's not as if the prosecutor has somehow

MR. GOLDBLATT:

5

No, no.

It's the judge alone

6

that is doing it.

7

what you're asking for is informed participation, the

8

ability to comment on a matter relating to the appropriate

9

sentence.

10

And I would submit — I would submit

Here, this record, I think, amply demonstrates

11

that counsel really didn't have the opportunity to comment

12

on departure.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge said, counsel, I've

14

been considering this over the weekend and I want you to

15

know before you address the court that I am considering

16

departing from the guidelines to increase the sentence.

17

Is that sufficient?

18

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Assuming the judge also

19

indicated the basis for the departure.

In other words, if

20

the judge said, I'm considering departing because of the

21

duration of these crimes, then I think courts have upheld

22

that it's been adequate unless counsel at that point

23

raises an objection that they need more time to address

24

the question of departure.

25

consistent with what rule 32(a) requires.

But that type of notice can be

And in fact, this is the rule that exists in

2

some six circuits at this point.

only circuit that has held otherwise.

premise is largely that one of the major changes that the

guidelines bring into the process is informed

the arguments as to whether or not departure is

13

appropriate is essential to effective representation of

14

the defendant or the Government and also is an important

tool in assuring that you don't have unwarranted

departures.

It may well be that in this case the judge would

have departed anyway had she heard from counsel.

3

But there's nothing remotely like that here.

4

And what you're arguing for seems to me something so, so

strange that the judge just says, I just want you to know

6

that I'm thinking of departing from the guideline.

7

counsel says, but why, Your Honor, and he says, well, I

8

don't have to tell you that.

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, Your Honor, I'm suggesting

10

that the judge does have to tell you that.

11

the judge says is I'm thinking of departing without

stating the grounds that that does not afford the

opportunity to —

You are requiring the grounds to be

is considering — I would assume in most situations this

the likelihood that a judge is going to come up with new

13

and different grounds at the proceeding itself.

QUESTION:

But the fact of the matter is that

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, assuming for the sake

19

of the question that the Court does not hold that you are

20

entitled as a matter of statute to the notice you require,

21

is the defendant in any different position for due process

22

purposes than the defendant would have been under the

23

prior law — the prior guideline law, rather?

24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Our position on that is that the

creation of guideline ranges with the use of the language

1

that the court shall sentence within the guideline range

2

unless certain factors are found to exist is sufficiently

3

mandatory as to change the due process calculus in much

4

the same way that the court has held in cases involving

5

statutory provisions that afford greater rights than

6

existed.

7
8

QUESTION:

But the language that you quote from

the guidelines goes to substance, not to notice.

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That is correct, but if a

10

substantive right is recognized to a sentence that is not

11

only within the statutory range but also that you have a

12

protectable liberty interest in the guideline range

13

itself, then it would — the court would have to determine

14

under Mathews v. Eldridge as to whether or not the notice

15

requirement materially aids — reduces the risk o'f error.

16

So in that situation, even if the rule did not provide it,

17

the Court could conclude, as it often does in due process

18

situations, that meaningful notice and an opportunity to

19

comment are fundamental protections of any liberty

20

interest.

21

So —
QUESTION:

So that your interpretation of the

22

guidelines is that a new liberty interest has been created

23

by them?

that the court shall sentence within the guideline range

is a substantial departure from previously existing

3

sentencing law in the Federal system and that it does

4

create a protectable interest and that in the

circumstances presented here the defendant should have the

he perceived no notice here and did not address it, that

15

the theory is, and I take it the position in petitioner's

MR. MARZEN:

yes, there would be something new, and under the

Unlike prior cases in which

Congress, in enacting the sentencing guidelines,

specifically rejected flat time and mandatory sentencing

given rise to an expectancy that one get a particular

It rejected both that and indeterminate

Minnesota's procedure was that of — was of presumptive

sentencing, which was to give the judge a presumptively

applicable guidelines range which the judge could depart

If the

defendant is surprised, he can file -- he can object upon

hearing the sentence.
As petitioner did here with respect to whether

4

he could voluntarily surrender, petitioner in fact

5

essentially told the district judge, on pages 60 and 61 of

6

the joint appendix, that he was going to file an appeal on

7

the departure issue but chose not to argue that question

before the district judge and instead argued whether he

You said that.

The fact was clear in the

MR. MARZEN:

And everybody saw that?
I think — I think in this case the

10

sentencing -- the transcript of the sentencing hearing

11

makes pretty clear that everyone knew that this was a

12

reasonable candidate for departure.

13

fact that petitioner's counsel, you know, didn't raise the

14

argument and object to the departure at the time or file a

post-hearing motion is because it was — it was really

fruitless.

It can share —

5

MR. MARZEN:

I don't think the — it — the rule

6

can fairly be read to require that.

7

that is that there are two sentences in rule 32(a)(1) and

8

we've only talked about one this morning.
The one we've talked about is the comment

10

And the reason for

sentence.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MARZEN:

Right.
There's a sentence that immediately

13

precedes it called a notice sentence.

14

pages 7a and 8a in the appendix to petitioner's brief.

15

And this is all at

The notice sentence specifically says that the

16

parties get notice of the probation officer's

17

determination pursuant to subdivision (c)(2)(b) of the

18

guidelines' range and the offender characteristics.

19

The comment sentence says that you have a right

20

to comment on that determination and on other matters

21

relating to the appropriate sentence.

22

is that subdivision (c)(2)(b), the cross-reference

23

subdivision, includes the explanation of the probation

24

officer of whether there is a fair ground for a departure

25

in this case.

The curious thing

So a fair reading of the notice sentence is
51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

the only thing that's omitted in the notice requirement in
rule 32 is exactly what petitioner asks or part of what
petitioner asks for here, which is some advanced notice of
the departure decision.
Reading the notice and the comment sentence
together I think is very revealing for a couple of
reasons.

It very clearly says that there's a right to

comment, not a right to notice.

It's a right to speak

your mind to the judge on anything you think that may bear
on the sentence.

It's not a right to be informed of what

those sentencing matters are.
Second, you can't imply notice in the comment
sentence without making the notice sentence superfluous.
In other words, if you substitute the words "notice and
comment" for the word "comment," there's just no meaning
for the -- no purpose that's served by the notice
sentence.
Finally, the two sentences also reveal one other
thing.

The notice sentence only requires notice of the

probation officer's determination.

It doesn't require

notice of what the judge is thinking.

And with the one

exemption -- exception I mentioned earlier about a judge's
intention to order a victim notice, there is nothing that
has changed the traditional sentencing practice.

The

judges do not have to circulate advisory sentences for

comment -QUESTION:

2

But Mr. Marzen, isn't there, isn't

3

there a reasonable explanation for that in the fact that

4

presumably the sentencing commission expected that

5

virtually all sentences would conform to the guidelines

6

or, if there were departures, that the reason for the

7

departure would be revealed in the presentence report.

8

It's a fairly rare situation if they put a provision like

9

this in, wouldn't it have more or less been an invitation

10

to departures,- which they didn't really want to invite?

11

MR. MARZEN:

Justice Stevens, the sentencing

12

guidelines passed by Congress contemplated quite a few

13

departures, in fact, about 20 percent of cases.

14

Senate report it notes 71.

way says that there were 20 percent departures in the

QUESTION:

Could you clarify one thing, a piece

of information you gave me earlier, about the number of

departures are around 12 percent and a certain percentage

were Government and certain were defense requested.

MR. MARZEN:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Those that — the downward departure

-- is it correct that, if you exclude downward departures

16

that the Government itself asked for, that it's still true

that downward departures exceed the number of upward

departures?

MR. MARZEN:

By a factor of 2.5 to 1.

And the

12

Counsel, this isn't really a classic

expressed by the —

MR. MARZEN:

Because the expectancy

No, that's the perversity, Justice

18

Kennedy.

19

The bitter-with-the-sweet argument goes that Congress gave

20

you something and you have to take the allegedly poor

21

procedure that came with it.

22

you something and gave you a nice procedure, too, but the

due process clause can be used to rachet it up even more

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Marzen, what's the due process

6

significance of this argument?

Counsel for the other side

7

says, I understand that I have a right to comment on any

8

subject that the court might take into consideration as a

9

basis for departure.

But if I do that without warning

10

that the court is considering it, I am in fact increasing

11

the odds that the court is going to do that.

12

If, for example, in this case I said, Your

13

Honor, pay no attention to the fact that it was $400,000

14

not $10,000, that's going to give the court an idea, isn't

15

it?

16

argument?

17

Is there, is there a due process significance in that

MR. MARZEN:

I don't think so, Justice Souter,

18

and the reason is that defense counsel and allocution had

19

this same problem before the sentencing guidelines were

20

passed in addressing -- in trying to explain away a

21

potentially very damaging or unfortunate fact about his

client's arrest -- you know, criminal history or something

else.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

For the Government implicit in their argument is

10

that everybody knew departure was a possibility and,

11

therefore, this came as no surprise.

12

entered a guilty plea in which it agreed that the

13

sentencing range for this case was 30 to 37 months, and at

14

page 6 of the joint appendix, what they didn't agree to

15

was where the sentence would be within that range.

The Government

They received a presentence report that said

16
17

there was no basis for a departure from the guideline

18

range.

19

the sentencing proceeding, argued on behalf of the

20

Government, did not ask for a departure from the

guidelines, did not state any grounds for departure.

to.

3

And what happened here is certainly not what
Congress anticipated was going to happen.

5

for that argument is Congress thought that sentencing as

6

it existed in the Federal system before the guidelines was

7

in a word, lousy.

8

They did change it radically.

9

changed was their perception of what was fair.

The first point

They sought to change it radically.
And part of what they

Justice Stevens, I think your point is very

11

important that Congress anticipated that in most, if not

12

all cases, the various grounds for sentencing would appear

13

in the presentence report or, if not there, in the

14

presentence report plus the parties were reacting to it.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, do you think that the

16

— that the possibility of the sentencing commission

17

creating new liberty interests is consistent with our

18

Mistretta decision, with the theory of approving the

19

existence of that body, the ability of that body to create

20

new liberty interests?

21

1

That's what they determined the case was.

4

10

^

That's what they agreed

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think so particularly because

22

of the structure in which Congress — I mean, Congress is

23

the one that really creates the liberty interest, not the

24

sentencing commission.

25

sentences should be within that range.

What Congress said was that
Congress is the

one that has created the liberty interest, not the

on 18, section 3553(b), so I think under that circumstance

it is consistent with Mistretta.
