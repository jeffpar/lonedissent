ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The court of appeals in this case struck down a

13

rule adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

14

in 1986 to eliminate the substantial market distortions

15

and inequities among consumers that resulted from the

16

prior system of vintage pricing for old gas.

17

gas is gas that was dedicated to interstate commerce prior

18

to the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.

19

Old natural

Although the regulatory history and market

20

context of this case may be somewhat complex, the case

21

boils down to straightforward questions of statutory

22

construction.

23

clearly authorizes the Commission to do what it did, but

24

if there were any question on that, the Commission's

25

actions, in our view, rest on a reasonable interpretation

On each we submit the text of the act

1

of the act.

2

Let me identify at the outset the two issues

3

that are presented here, principal issues.

First is what

4

I will refer to as the pricing issue.

5

106 of the Natural Gas Policy Act authorize the Commission

6

by rule or order to raise the ceiling price of any gas or

7

any category of gas, as long as the Commission finds that

8

the higher price is "just and reasonable within the

9

meaning of the Natural Gas Act."

Sections 104 and

The court of appeals

10

held that this language did not authorize the Commission

11

to depart from the prior vintage pricing system for old

12

gas, but instead permitted the Commission only to grant

13

special relief from applicable ceilings where.it believed

14

warranted..

15

The court ignored the plain meaning of the

16

statutory text, which contemplates price increases of

17

general applicability.

18

the broad and flexible interpretation given to the just

19

and reasonable standard by the Commission, by this Court

20

in its classic rate making cases, Hope Natural Gas,

21

Permian Basin, and Mobil Oil, and by the lower courts

22

immediately prior to the adoption of the Natural Gas

23

Policy Act and the incorporation of that language into the

24

act.

25

But beyond that, it also ignored

The second issue concerns the abandonment of

service under Order 451.

2

with the provision in Order 451 that permits a producer of

3

gas to abandon its sales to a pipeline or other purchaser

4

where the purchaser is unwilling, after negotiations, to

5

pay a higher price for old gas allowed by the order.

6

QUESTION:

The court of appeals found fault

Mr. Kneedler, my I ask you about the

7

abandonment question —

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

— that we have in front of us.

Is

10

it possible that an individual plaintiff could come in and

11

challenge an abandonment and assert specific grounds and

12

get a hearing?

Do we know whether that is possible?

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

Well, there — the Commission's

14

regulations specific — the answer is yes.

15

Commission's regulations specifically provide for the

16

filing of complaints, and if a purchaser objected to a

17

proposed abandonment on the grounds that the standards

18

prescribed in Order 451 have not been met in the

19

particular case, it could file a complaint and seek an

20

adjudication of that.

21
22

QUESTION:

The

It wasn't clear to me from your brief

whether that is the position that FERC was taking.

24

position.

25

that.

No, that is, that is clearly our

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

What the Commission — the

3

standard for abandonment under section 7(b) of the Natural

4

Gas Act, the Commission may authorize abandonment if it

5

concludes that the present or future public convenience or

6

necessity warrants the abandonment.

7

after due hearing.

8

that it was, that upon the occurrence of certain

9

conditions subsequent, a producer would be authorized to

And it also says

And what the Commission concluded here

10

abandon the gas service.

So what the Commission did was

11

give particular content to the general statutory standard

12

of public convenience and necessity in Order 451 itself.

13

And this Court has held in numerous cases that

14

an agency, and particularly the Commission's predecessor,

15

the FPC, may do that under the Natural Gas Act.

16

upon the occurrence of those, satisfaction of those

17

standards, the producer is permitted to abandon the sale

18

of gas.

19

individualized hearing on the general standards that were

20

promulgated by rule, because the pipelines and others had

21

an opportunity to participate in the hearing afforded by

22

that rule making.

23

is whether the producer satisfied those conditions.

24
25

And then,

There is, the pipeline has no right to an

What could be challenged in a complaint

Now there has also been a question raised as to
whether there might be an opportunity for waiver of the

1

general standards under the rule, and that is a procedure

2

that has been referred to in several of this Court's cases

3

discussing general stan — abandonment or similar, not

4

abandonment, but similar generalized determinations under

5

which parties may obtain rights.

6

discussed those in several other cases, Storer and FPC v.

7

Texaco.

8
9

And the Court has

But — in WNCN, for example, the Court noted
that it had not resolved the question of whether a

10

provision for waiver would be necessary.

And in fact it

11

doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of this case,

12

because what triggers the opportunity for abandonment

13

under this, under Order 451, is the purchaser's refusal to

14

pay the rate requested by the pipe, by the producer up to

15

the new ceiling prescribed by Order 451.

16

what triggers abandonment under this order is a

17

purchaser's refusal to pay a rate of general applicability

18

that the Commission has prescribed.

19

their nature, items of general applicability that do not

20

require, at least short of constitutional insufficiency,

21

the opportunity for waivers or special exceptions, as

22

under Permian Basin.

23

nature, intrinsic nature of Order 451 and the pricing

24

schedule, or ceiling set in place by that requires an

25

opportunity for a waiver.

In other words,

The rates are, by

So we don't believe that, that the

But if a pipeline or other purchaser thought

1
2

that a waiver was nevertheless appropriate, as we point

3

out in our reply brief, the purchaser would have an

4

opportunity to file a petition under the general rules

5

governing the filing of petitions under the Commission's

6

regulations.

7

the court below that the Commission had authority under

8

section 16 of the Natural Gas Act to grant a waiver from

9

the provisions of Order 451 in appropriate circumstances.

10

Although Williams made a passing request for an

And in fact, Williams Natural Gas argued in

11

exemption or waiver in its rehearing petition in these

12

rule making proceedings before the Commission, that is not

13

the right place for an individual pipeline or purchaser to

14

request an exception.

15

petition with the Commission, where the Commission can

16

focus on the equities of the particular purchaser, outside

17

of the context of adopting a rule of general

18

applicability.
QUESTION:

19
20

The proper procedure is to file a

Would that petition necessarily be

given a hearing?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that what would be

22

required is that the, that the purchaser would at least

23

have to make a showing of pretty substantial reasons why

24

an exception should be made to the general standards in

25

Order 451.

1

QUESTION:

So if I think that the, that the word

2

hearing in 7(b) in that context requires an individualized

3

hearing, it is not your contention that this waiver

4

procedure through petition would necessarily satisfy it?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

QUESTION:

Well, I — I think the place —

I mean, you say the waiver, the

7

waiver procedure is available, but you are not arguing

8

that that necessarily fulfills the requirement, if there

9

is one, which you contend there is not, of an

10

individualized hearing.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, not across the board.

But

12

in the context of this case, again going back to what this

13

Court said in FPC v. Texaco, which concerned the same sort

14

of argument about a right to a hearing under section 7(c)

15

of the Natural Gas Act; and what the Court said, it was

16

fine for the Commission to weed out at the threshold,

17

solely by virtue of not satisfying the standards and the

18

rule adopted by the Commission, various private entities

19

were applying for special relief.

20

possibility of applying for a waiver.

21

thing would apply here.

22

But it left open the
I think the same

What the pipeline could not contest in such a

23

hearing is the general standards set forth in the rule

24

itself, because again, those were adopted after due

25

hearing in the rule making proceeding on the order itself,

1

which is again the conclusion the Court reached in FPC v.

2

Texaco.

3

application would be to show that his particular condition

4

so departed from the premises of the order that special

5

relief was warranted.

6

What the pipeline could request in such a waiver

Now again, I am not in a position to speak on

7

behalf of the Commission as to what its response would be

8

to a particular waiver application.

9

that the Commission's regulations do not foreclose it, and

My only point here is

10

that none of the respondents in this case has pursued the

11

procedure that would be appropriate under the Commission's

12

regulations to present that claim.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, perhaps it isn't

14

significant, but we are talking about kind of an

15

abandonment of a particular customer, rather than

16

abandonment of service in the sense of the supply of gas

17

is, doesn't come off the market, it just goes to some

18

other purchaser, doesn't it?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

In fact, under the good

20

faith negotiation procedure set up by the Commission in

21

Order 451, the producer cannot abandon, may not abandon

22

until it has entered into a contract with another

23

purchaser to purchase that same gas.

24

deemed this to be an important protection in the public

25

interest, public convenience and necessity, because it

And the Commission

11

1

assures that the gas will be, will remain in the market

2

and not be lost forever.
And it is that purpose that in our view lends

3
4

considerable support to the Commission's approach.

5

Because not only, not only has the Commission determined

6

from the overall needs of the market that it's proper to

7

release that gas to a new purchaser under the

8

circumstances, but even comparing the two competing

9

purchasers, as it were, the existing purchaser and the new

10

purchaser, the Commission has concluded that the, if the

11

new purchaser is prepared to pay more, or under more

12

favorable circumstances for that particular gas, that the,

13

that as between those two purchasers, the subsequent

14

purchaser, market indications show, has a greater need for

15

it.

16

concluded that it is proper in circumstances for an agency

17

to rely on the market to resolve questions of comparative

18

need, or in that case, diversity of programming.

19

it is -- and the Commission made that point on rehearing,

20

relying on WNCN, that it is really the same sort of

21

comparative needs of the two pipelines.

22

And that -- the Court, again in WNCN v. FCC,

QUESTION:

And so

Mr. Kneedler, do you agree with the

23

statement I see in the brief on the other side, the

24

Commission has admitted that the new ceiling price for old

25

gas would not be just and reasonable if it were actually

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we do not.

The Commission,

as we point out in our reply brief, the Commission

Act.

of the ceilings for post-1974 gas.

rule was in fact set up for the protection of respondents

2

and pipelines and consumers, not for the protection of

3

producers.

4

would not make sense for the market as a whole.

5

explain why that is so.

6

the contracts between producers and pipelines contained

7

contract provisions, typically indefinite price escalator

8

clauses, that would have allowed the price the pipeline

9

was required to pay under existing contracts to rise to

Let me

The 90 percent — 90 percent of

That new ceiling level was and is

And the Commission concluded that the market

12
13

distortions it was trying to eliminate by raising the

14

ceiling would be reintroduced if the market, if the price

15

of old gas went from substantially below the market to

16

substantially above the market, and that it would also be

17

appropriate to mitigate the impact on individual

18

pipelines.

19

as a prerequisite to collecting this higher rate, the

20

producer would have to trigger negotiations with the

21

pipeline to enter into a mutually agreed upon price.

22

if the pipeline refuses to pay a price up to the ceiling

23

would abandonment occur.

24

pipeline refused to pay a price that it was contractually

25

obligated to pay under the escalator clauses could

And so what the Commission did was to say that

2

abandonment occur.
And so, contrary to the court of appeals' view

3

of the good faith negotiation system, this is not

4

one-sided or unfavorable to the, to the pipelines.

5

QUESTION:

What about the other 10 percent that

6

didn't have an escalator clause?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Doesn't this —

If the --

Doesn't this provision apply to them?
No, it does not.

If — under

10

this Court's Mobil Sierra Doctrine as incorporated in

11

section 101(b)(9) of the act, the contract price controls.

12

And if there is no provision in the contract between the

13

producer and the pipeline to increase the prices, there is

14

no contractual authority and no right of the producer to

15

charge the higher price.

16

QUESTION:

But Mr. Kneedler, it is true, just

17

following up on Justice White's question, that the ceiling

18

price is presumably above the market price for most of the

19

old gas, and that that price is nevertheless, in your

20

view, just and reasonable?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Yes.
And the reason that is so is

24

because the Commission con -- this price is based on

calculations the Commission did in 1974, which have been

updated over time by inflation.

It's an estimate of the

2

replacement cost, the long-term replacement cost of these

3

supplies of old gas.

4

gas generally is below that long-term replacement cost,

5

but that doesn't detract from the justness and

6

reasonableness of the ceiling the Commission has

7

prescribed.

8

strongly reinforcing this, that the new price ceiling and

allowing the prices to increase would elicit 11 trillion

And in fact, the Commission also concluded,

10

cubic feet of additional supplies of old gas, which would

11

compete with new gas, bring down prices, and stabilize the

12

market.
If the Court has no further questions at this

13
14

time, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for

rebuttal.

as it is higher and so long as it is just and reasonable.

And that is all that has happened here.

specifically what has happened here.

4

yourself then, under those circumstances, what is it that

5

FERC did that was wrong?

6

That is

And you have to ask

Our opponents' only real answer to that is that

7

this amounts to de facto regulation.

That is nothing more

8

than substituting a label for what the statute says.

9

Moreover, Order 55 did not in fact deregulate.

What it

10

did was to set a new ceiling, a higher ceiling, just as

11

the statute requires.

12

the market, in the event that it might go above the

13

ceiling, that is still a ceiling and therefore still a

14

regulated price.

existing vintages for old gas, and that that was the

compromise that Congress reached, is true as far as it

it leaves out is the half that is dispositive of this

what kind of hearing is due under section 7(b).

at the outset that this falls well within the Vermont

reason why the hearing that was due in this case was not

that reason is bottomed on the FERC's governing

substantive standard has on the procedural argument that

they are making in this case.

4

Finally, the Court has held on several occasions

5

that generic hearings do satisfy the statutory requirement

6

that there be a hearing, and that is particularly

7

appropriate in the context of this case, where the statute

says due hearing.

9

implies a great deal of discretion in the Commission in

And that language is, by its nature

determining what kind of a hearing is due.
What Mr. Kneedler said in response to Justice

12

Scalia's question about whether there would be opportunity

13

for not only consideration by the Commission, but also the

14

hearing, even if we assume that an individualized hearing

15

is required, which has not been decided really, and even

16

if we assume that the Commission wouldn't grant it — and

17

that has not yet been determined, that issue ought to be

decided, if at all, at such time that anyone actually asks

19

for a hearing — then you still have the question, or you

still have the point that the proper remedy is simply to

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9

MS. HALLADAY:

Thank you, Chief Justice

Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:
This is not a basic rate case.

This case

involves an effort by the Federal Energy Regulatory

10

Commission to overturn the pricing and regulatory policies

11

for natural gas prescribed by Congress in precise and

12

detailed language set forth in the Natural Gas Policy Act

13

and the Natural Gas Act.

14

has taken three interrelated actions that are directly

15

contrary to the plain language of those statutes.

16

In Order No. 451 the Commission

First, the Commission upset the pricing policy

17

of Congress embodied in title I of the NGPA by placing

18

significant incentives for additional production of old

19

gas for the expressed purpose of displacing any further

20

development of new gas.

21

virtually entirely any kind of regulatory rate control

22

over old gas, and stated repeatedly in Order No. 451 that

23

the purpose it had taken its action was to allow gas to be

24

priced by the market, that is deregulate it.

25

the Commission surrendered to the marketplace the very

Second, the Commission removed

And finally,

1

specific statutory responsibilities it long had held under

2

the Natural Gas Act and that Congress had expressly

3

preserved in the Natural Gas Policy Act to regulate the

4

sale and abandonment of gas sold to the interstate market.

5

In vacating Order No. 451, the Fifth Circuit

6

closely examined the language, history, and purposes of

7

the Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act.

8

looked to the actual end result of Order No. 451 and

9

determined that the Commission had taken an action that

It then

10

only Congress could take or that only Congress could

11

authorize the Commission to take, namely to deregulate old

12

gas and to remove all remaining controls on the sale and

13

abandonment of that gas to the market.

14

QUESTION:

Ms. Halladay, the statute says that

as far as we are concerned?

It doesn't talk about maintaining

And FERC has interpreted its powers as

MS. HALLADAY:

Isn't that the end of it

It cannot be the end of it

21

unless, of course, we ignore the statute as a whole.

22

what should be made clear at first is that sections

23

104(b)(2) and 106(c) did not just carry forward the just

24

and reasonable rate making authority that the Commission

25

previously had had in the Natural Gas Act.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260

It changed

Now

1

that authority by stating that the Commission could only

2

raise rates.

3

the past, when the Commission could raise or lower, it

4

could take a much more involved role in trying to make gas

5

market-responsive.

6

to raise rates suggests that Congress had some different

7

purpose in mind than in the past.

8
9

It did not allow them to lower rates.

In

The limitation of its authority only

The second thing is, the Commission itself
repeatedly interpreted this provision to state that it

10

required that, it provided an outlet, rather, for those

11

producers whose actual costs of production exceeded the

12

average ceiling prices set by Congress, and thereby would,

13

without relief, have a constitutional, unconstitutional

14

compensation through property.

15

QUESTION:

Well, certainly the Commission can

16

change its mind and its approach, so long as it's within

17

its statutory authority.

18

MS. HALLADAY:

It can change its mind.

It can't

19

change Congress' mind, and here that is what they did.

20

Congress decided that there should not be great incentives

21

placed on the incentives of old gas, that incentives

22

should be given to new and hard-to-produce gas, because

23

that is precisely where new sources of supply would come

24

to the market.

25

QUESTION:

Well, Congress decided that that

legislation.

But it did not decide that that should never

4

MS. HALLADAY:

QUESTION:

I think —

I mean, does that appear anywhere in

6

the statute?

provision is worded, that Congress essentially said right

9

the power of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to

do it.
MS. HALLADAY:

And yet the Federal Energy

12

Regulatory Commission also ruled in Order 72 that one of

13

the key components of the overall pricing scheme of the

14

NGPA had been the continued availability of sections 104

15

and 106 to old gas.

16

in Order 451 is it has melded together approximately

17

one-half of all of the pricing categories that Congress

18

established, and it has set a rate that is equal to an

19

incentive rate the Commission set under another provision

20

of the NGPA, 107(c)(5) .

21

Now what the Commission has done here

Now that provision states that the Commission

22

can only when it is reasonably necessary set a new

23

incentive based price for gas in this, in the 107(c)(5)

24

case, that is produced at extraordinary cost or risk.

25

in a prior proceeding the Commission determined that the
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And

1

ceiling price now set here in Order 451 represented such

2

an incentive price.

3

is low-cost in production and does not involve

4

extraordinary risk, it should get the same incentive.

5

it has thereby read 107(c)(5) right out of the act.

Now they say for gas that they admit

And

6

But the bottom line is that whatever authority

7

the Commission had in sections 104(b)(2) and 106(c), and

8

they previously had said it was a special relief

9

mechanism, they also have very clearly stated that it is

10

not the authority to deregulate the price of gas.

And

11

that is in fact what they have done in this case, and let

12

me explain why.
There is no doubt in this case that there are no

That is the ceiling price, Ms.

MS. HALLADAY:

6

QUESTION:

Is the new ceiling price —

Is the new ceiling.

Now, as these

7

GFN procedures have worked in practice, have most of them

8

ended up with the pipeline paying the ceiling price or

9

paying something less?

10

MS. HALLADAY:

There have been, as Mr. Kneedler

11

pointed out, a number of negotiations.

record of all of them, because in many cases they don't

13

have to file anymore with the Commission what happens.

14

But there are in some instances voluntary negotiations

15

that have been at a market price, in other words a price

16

that would have been established had this gas been

17

deregulated.

18

where pipelines, some of whom are respondents in this

19

proceeding, have offered to pay the market price and the

20

producer has come back and stated that is not sufficient,

21

and then cancelled the contract.

22

We don't even have

However, there are many other instances

Now, there is another point that bears repeating

23

here, and that is that the agreement to actually pay the

24

market price does not mean that any new gas will be

25

produced from these existing production reserves.

That of

course was the whole point of the rule making, was to

2

bring an additional 11 TCF to the market.

3

change in the contract term is offered by the pipeline

4

purchaser, that can be grounds for the termination of the

5

contract by the producer.

But if any

So if the pipeline purchaser states to the

6
7

producer that I will pay the new ceiling price, that is

8

admittedly now nearly twice the spot market price for gas,

9

but in return for that agreement I would ask that you

10

agree to actually produce more gas from these reserves,

11

that could be viewed as a change in contract terms and it

12

would enable the producer to walk away from the contract.

13

Furthermore, nothing in this rule even requires the

14

producer to actually produce any more gas.
QUESTION:

15

When you say the pipeline offers to

16

pay the market price, that suggests that the price it is

17

paying under the contract is lower than market?

lower than market.

a success in that objective, isn't it?
MS. HALLADAY:

Yes, but now, if that is true, it

is interesting because precise language in section 121 of

13

the act stated where Congress intended to deregulate and

where it did not intend to price deregulate.

15

primarily it chose to deregulate new and hard-to-produce

18

Department of Justice proposed as an alternative to the

19

procedure actually adopted that the Commission simply

allow the parties to negotiate in the market any price

21

that they wanted, and then once they negotiated it, simply

the abandonment requirements than what the Commission

required in Order 451.
But the Commission rejected that Justice

authority to allow the market to set the rates.

did it do?

8

And the only difference between the purportedly

unlawful — or the, no, the actual unlawful action that it

10

found the Department of Justice had proposed, and what it

11

did here was to set some ceiling price.

12

Department of Energy recently stated, any ceiling price

13

that is this far above the market effectively deregulates

14

the gas.

15

It achieves the same deregulatory result that the

Commission found in Order 451 it had no power to take.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Commission's position

on that is that its jurisdiction does not extend to

10

additional productions of gas from wells, that that is

11

subject to State jurisdiction.

12

forth in the Northwest Central Pipeline case.

13

one of the reasons why the Commission concluded it was

14

necessary to have a price incentive, to encourage

15

producers to continue to produce old gas.

16

trillion feet of natural gas would have been lost, the

17

Commission determined, to the market.

18

challenge that determination by the Commission, and has

19

exhaustively talked —

QUESTION:

The Commission set that
And that is

Otherwise 11

Respondents do not

So this order doesn't, this order

21

just doesn't deal with the problem of abandonment that we

22

normally think of in other regulatory contexts of

23

discontinuing production?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

And again, only in circumstances

where the, where the pipeline is unwilling to pay the

4

market-responsive price and a price that it is obligated

5

to pay by contract.

6

been a hugely successful order.

7

gas at the end of 1989 exactly equaled the market price of

8

gas generally, $1.69 per thousand cubic feet.

I should also point out that this has
The market price of old

What this, this order has been a success in

9
10

eliminating the distortions and the unfairness among

11

consumers, and the long-time disparity with respect to

12

replacement cost, and bringing this sort of order to a

13

nationwide market that Congress wanted to have when it

14

enacted the Natural Gas Policy Act.

15

the Commission's goal under that act is to assure adequate

16

supplies at fair prices.

17

This Court said that

And surely a regulatory system that requires, in

18

the end, pipelines to pay what the market will bear and

19

producers to charge what the market will bear, with a

20

touchstone to the market pricing system that Congress set

21

loose in the Natural Gas Policy Act itself, is fair and it

22

is also, within the meaning of the act, just and

23

reasonable.
