CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOT C. ROTHENBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is on writ of certiorari from the

12

Minnesota Supreme Court which held that promises of

13

confidentiality from newspapers to a source of information

14

were unenforceable because it would violate the First

15

Amendment rights of the newspapers.

16

presents the question of whether newspapers have the right

17

to inflict injuries by dishonoring voluntary promises used

18

to obtain information.

19

Cohen v. Cowles Media

Honoring promises of confidentiality is critical

20

in ensuring the free flow of information to the public.

21

An expert witness in the trial to this case testified that

22

at least one-third of all newspaper stories and 85 percent

23

of news magazine stories come from sources promised

24

confidentiality by the media organizations involved.

25

QUESTION:

Well, why should the desirability of

1

keeping the promise of confidentiality on the part of a

2

media organization be subject to our decision here?

3

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Because, Your Honor — because,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that

5

the First Amendment barred enforceability of these

6

promises.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, and if — if the Minnesota

8

Supreme Court was wrong on that point, we would say, or if

9

we thought so, we would say that the First Amendment did

10

not bar the enforcement of those promises.

11

that we would express any views on the merits as whether

12

it's desireable as to public policy to enforce them or

13

not.

14

MR. ROTHENBERG:

But I doubt

Mr. Chief Justice, I was really

15

raising this issue to point out the First Amendment values

16

that are involved that to ensure the free flow of

17

information to the public, news media consider it

18

necessary to make these promises and it's also necessary

19

to keep these promises to avoid drying up the flow of

20

information from sources.

21
22

QUESTION:

The First Amendment requires that

these contractual obligations be enforceable.

23

MR. ROTHENBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes —

You're taking the polar view from the

view that the Minnesota Supreme Court took.

MR. ROTHENBERG:
Your Honor.

Is that a

That is a possible resolution,

Justice Scalia, it's been the position of the

10

trial court and the Minnesota court of appeals and also of

11

course the petitioner in this case that the First

12

Amendment simply ought not to allow the news media

13

organizations who are parties to this case to break

14

promises they voluntarily made in order to obtain

15

information, that the media organization should be subject

16

to the same law as everyone else —

QUESTION:

MR. ROTHENBERG:

20

But —
— every other business, every

other individual in keeping their promises.
QUESTION:

Well, then what you're saying is that

21

the First Amendment doesn't accord them any special

22

protection when they break their promises.

MR. ROTHENBERG:

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Justice Kennedy, it's — that

necessary conflict between the First Amendment and rules

10

And not only that but that there are certain values of the

11

First Amendment which are enhanced by promoting these

12

promises — by honoring these promises rather than

13

allowing newspapers to violate these promises (inaudible).

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothenberg, the — I have a

15

little difficulty with the opinion that we're asked to

review.

theory as a matter of State law.

As I read it, the court first rejected a contract

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

And then it went on to address

20

whether there was promissory estoppel.

QUESTION:

1

Did you argue promissory estoppel?

Why did the court even address it?

In Minnesota, Your Honor,

That was pointed out in the opinion

And the Minnesota Supreme Court discussed this

10

implied contract under rules of promissory estoppel.

11

then went on to say that such a promise would be

12

unenforceable in this case because it would violate the

13

First Amendment rights of the newspapers.

14

QUESTION:

But

The problem I have is that I didn't

15

understand how the court could address it at all if it was

16

never urged below.

MR. ROTHENBERG:

It isn't necessary, Justice

18

O'Connor, in Minnesota, to specifically plead promissory

estoppel apart from general contract law.

21

and in another case which was cited in the opinion below,

22

both of these cases the parties did not specifically plead

or argue promissory estoppel or implied contract as

distinct from conventional contract —

1

And as a matter of State law, it's

possible to sustain a jury verdict that was presented on a

different theory —

Yes.

That's the Minnesota State law?
MR. ROTHENBERG:

Uh-huh.

This — Your Honor,

there is no — there is not this fine or close distinction

between implied contracts on a promissory estoppel or

10

conventional contracts.

Christianson case where in fact the lower court held

13

against the plaintiff, and then the Minnesota Supreme

Court reversed the decision on the basis of an implied

contract through promissory estoppel when the issue had

not been raised below.

17

It's based upon section 90 of the
And in both this case and the

So, in Minnesota State practice, it is possible

18

to do this without specifically pleading promissory

19

estoppel as apart from conventional contract.

finish if I may.

Here, you -- the plaintiff sought

damages for the disclosure.

O'Connor, plaintiff did not ask that this publication be

11

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Is it your view

Could it be sought?

That

12

presents the issue of prior restraint, Your Honor, and it

13

would present a different issue than damages.

14

this case does not involve any attempt for prior restraint

15

nor would I think any principle established by the

16

Minnesota Court of Appeals or the trial court involve any

17

issue of prior restraint on publication by newspapers.

18

merely involves the issue of whether newspaper should be

19

liable for their promises and whether they should be

20

liable for damages caused by violations of their promises,

QUESTION:

Mr.

decision on its own view of where the law best leaves the

parties.

20

And isn't that the holding of the case?
MR.

ROTHENBERG:

Your Honor, the holding of the

21

case from the Minnesota Supreme Court we would submit was

22

purely based upon the First Amendment where it says

23

towards the end of the decision,

24

enforcement of respondent's promises in this case would

25

violate that First Amendment rights —

"we conclude that the

Well, isn't the most that you can say

is that that was an alternative holding, and in fact the

But the court is

13

saying offer consideration contract theory is not the

No, Your Honor, Justice Souter,

any fair reading of the decision would lead one to

5

don't want to prolong this, but do you agree that if the

6

court had not gone onto the further language,

7

that the" — that the First — "that there would be

8

violation of First Amendment rights in enforcing the

9

contract," do you agree that if the court had not gone on

"we conclude

10

to that further statement that the holding in the case and

11

the result in the case, rather, I should say -- the result

12

in the case would be exactly the same as it is now?

13

Because the result in the case would rest, as I understand

14

it, on the court's conclusion that the law best leaves the

15

parties to their trust in each other.

16

wouldn't the result be exactly the same if it had not gone

17

Justice Souter, we would submit

classic First Amendment situation of a source providing

That was. about a sentence or

10

information in connection with a political campaign which

11

they called the quintessential First Amendment situation.

12

And then they said that we think that in this

13

situation, the law best leaves the parties to the trust in

each other.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothenberg, I thought when they

said the law best leaves the parties to the trust in each

QUESTION:

Yes, we haven't always agreed with

them, though.
*

6

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Right.

But the positions they

7

took in those cases, Justice Stevens, was that if

8

newspapers are forced to expose their sources that sources

9

will dry up, that the public will be deprived of important

10

information it now gets from confidential sources, and

11

that will disserve the interest of the First Amendment.

12

That's exactly the position they took in the Branzburg

13

case about 20 years ago.

Justice Stevens, if I could perhaps answer the question

that, as in the Minnesota Court of Appeals — the First

Amendment really ought not to be applicable to this case.

ought not to be interpreted to give newspapers or other

media organizations a right to violate their voluntary

promises with another private person.

It based its

First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and refer to

several U. — United States Supreme Court cases in that

regard.
Can do — to continue, many arguments were made

in the briefs on the applicability of the First Amendment.

7

The issue generally is — comes down to whether a private

agreement, an agreement between private individuals, a

9

newspaper on the one hand and a source of information on

10

the other, ought to implicate the First Amendment at all

11

and whether the Minnesota Supreme Court acted in error, as

12

we submit it did, in holding that the First Amendment

makes these promises unenforceable, because we have here,

again, a private agreement — no State compulsion, no

governmental compulsion — on the — forcing the

7

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, we would

8

submit that there is a difference between the New York

9

Times v. Sullivan type of situation and this type of case.

10

New York Times v. Sullivan protected a newspaper from

11

inadvertently publishing defamation about someone else.

12

It did not involved a situation where a newspaper made an

13

agreement with a private person to obtain information.

14

obtained this information and then the newspaper decided

15

that it was going to violate the agreement.

But I don't think there's a difference in the

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Except, Mr. Chief Justice, that

20

again involves the voluntary agreement.

21

there are many other ways of looking at the issue as well.

22

For example, the issue of waiver.

23

a promise of confidentiality to a news source or makes a

24

voluntary promise of any sort, does it then have the right

25

to say that we're going to violate that promise because we

have a First Amendment right to do that so?

We submit

2

that once that promise is voluntarily made, the newspaper

3

has in effect waived the right to make any First Amendment

4

claim of a right to violate the promise.

5

promises of newspapers or media organizations would be

6

virtually worthless, not only to news source

7

confidentiality but at any individuals or businesses that

8

newspapers deal with.

Otherwise,

Again — so in the other issues relating to this

is whether newspapers should have the right to violate

agreements, should be subject to the same law as applied

to everyone else, every other individual or every other

21

business who makes an agreement with another party.

Finally, in — in Branzburg v. Hayes, the

values as to require constitutional protection.

Mr. Rothenberg argued here today before this Court, as he

QUESTION:

MR. FRENCH:

You did not publish.
But what this Court has said —
You didn't publish all the truth.
That's absolutely right, Your

Honor.

What the Court has said, however, on that score is

11

that that is a subject to be left to editorial judgment.

This Court has said that editorial judgment is a part of

You're saying more than that.

You're

saying contract obligations can't stand in way.

What if a

What Mr. Cohen —

It's a very odd calculus that the

19

person closest to the truth — in this case the source —

20

cannot protect his ability to divulge or not to divulge

21

but that as you get further away from the sources of

22

truth, i.e., in the newspaper room, you say, oh, then the

23

newspaper has a right to protect its information by a

24

contract suit.

25

just the other way around.

And that's what this case is about.

Mr. Cohen

wants, by contract, to restrict the ability of editors to

MR. FRENCH:

1

No, I would not say that, Your

Honor.

3

to say here is that when a private citizen attempts to

4

assert a right under contract law — which by the way, the

5

Minnesota Supreme Court said doesn't exist — to suppress

6

publication of a piece of information.

7

information is truthful and has to do with a matter of

high, public significance, then under all the decisions of

And

1

First Amendment had no part to play in those rulings.

2

Under those circumstances, the claims that petitioner

plead and tried and briefed and argued have been lost to

him under Minnesota State law, and there is no way that

5

they can be retrieved.

6

QUESTION:

It is —

Well, how is it that the court got

7

into its discussion of promissory estoppel?

8

Minnesota State law principle that enables the plaintiff

9

to rely on that even though it wasn't directly raised

11

Is there some

below?
MR. FRENCH:

There is not, Justice O'Connor, and

12

with respect I have to — I have to dispute Mr.

13

Rothenberg's representation of Minnesota State law.

I

14

think the Court can consult the Cowles Media brief.

I

15

believe footnote 3 at page 13 on this subject.

16

What happened — in response to your question —

17

not only to me but to Mr. Rothenberg, Justice O'Connor, is

18

that no one thought about promissory estoppel until, on

19

rebuttal argument in the Minnesota Supreme Court, Justice

20

Yetka, one of the dissenting justices, raised it as a

21

possibility — isn't it possible that estoppel might apply

22

to this set of facts.

23

The Minnesota Supreme Court then did indeed

24

address it, but it is not essential to the decision to

25

vacate the judgment that petitioner won at the trial court

QUESTION:

But surely there's a strong

intimation in the part of a majority opinion in the

Supreme Court of Minnesota dealing with promissory

MR. FRENCH:

It is difficult in the context of

No, it was the court talking about

Justice Souter's point that the holdings are alternative

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOT C. ROTHENBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court again:
Your Honors, I would like to make a couple of

22

points on rebuttal.

23

the decision below was based on the First Amendment.

24

would submit that any fair reading indicates that in fact

25

was based upon the First Amendment.

First regarding the issue of whether

implications but now we must.

estoppel, there can be no neutrality towards the First

Amendment.

7

constitutional rights of a free press against the common

8

law interest in protecting a promise of anonymity, and

says that of critical significance to this case is the

Under a promissory

The Court must — must balance the

10

fact that this promise was made in a classic First

11

Amendment context of the quintessential public debate in

12

our democracy.

13

And finally the court concluded that these

14

promises were unenforceable because of the First

15

Amendment.

16

We would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that there

17

can be no question that the Minnesota Supreme Court

18

regarded that its decision was required by the First

19

Amendment.

20

Now, regarding the issue of promissory estoppel,

21

again, under this decision, and under the Christianson

22

decision referred to in the decision below, that under

23

Minnesota law when a party pleads a breach of contract

24

that under Minnesota law that court can decide on the

25

basis of promissory estoppel, which basically implies a

contract, that State law of Minnesota.
And finally the fact that the Minnesota Supreme

3

Court did consider First Amendment issues is sufficient to

4

give this Court jurisdiction under the several cases that

5

were referred to in the briefs under our longstanding

6

practice by the United States Supreme Court.

7

Mr. French says that the issue of whether — if

8

the promise is kept -- this is going to prevent the

9

publication of truth.

But the question is quite

10

different, Your Honor.

11

truth in many cases up to 75, 80 percent of the cases in

12

terms of certain news media, their media organizations

13

must make these promises of confidentiality to induce

14

sources of information to give them information.

15

these promises, they would not have the truthful

16

information to convey to the public.

17

deprived of information.

18

QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, to obtain the

Without

The public would be

Now, that's a very —

Well, Mr. Rothenberg, that troubles

19

me a little, because Mr. Cohen could have sent the

20

information in an unmarked envelope presumably, and the

21

paper would still have had it, right?

22

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, but Mr.

23

Cohen, as many other confidential sources, felt that he

24

could trust the promises of the reporters.

25

the promises would be honored, and therefore, he accepted

He felt that

Basically, the issue is —

3

QUESTION:

Of course, you can't say it comes

4

from a reliable source if you get it in an unmarked

5

envelop, and I assume no responsible reporter would use it

6

if it just came — you know, unless it was independently

7

verifiable somehow.

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11
12

Well, I guess if it was — the

question here was just a court record of an earlier
prosecution which then the paper could obviously check it.
MR. ROTHENBERG:

Yes, Justice O'connor.

Yes,

Justice Scalia, on that one.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. ROTHENBERG:

No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

15

— but I think Mr. Cohen felt that, again, he could trust

16

the promises that — as you pointed out, Justice Scalia,

17

that when delivered and trusting the promises — perhaps

18

we carry a little bit more —

19

QUESTION:

I thought you were making a more

20

general argument, Mr. Rothenberg, about the utility of

21

having contractual liability in general, not just in this

22

particular case.

23

the argument you're making, it's not —

Just in this particular case, if that's

Your Honor, the issue that is

raised by Justice Yetka below, where he pointed out that

1

the real issue of this case is the fact that the

2

newspapers made a promise to Mr. Cohen.

3

upon that promise and provided information that the

4

newspapers consider valuable, in fact, published on the

5

first page of the Star Tribune newspaper.

6

their promise to him.

7

their promises to them, they caused him damage --

8

considerable damages in the force — in the form of

getting him fired from his job and subsequent financial

damages.
Any other person, any other business, any -- in

12

a similar situation would be liable for damages for breach

of contract.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Why did he get fired from his job?

Why did he get fired from his job as a consequence?
MR. ROTHENBERG:

Justice Blackmun, he got fired

17

from his job precisely because of the newspaper articles.

18

When those articles came out the next day, the Star

19

Tribune article not only identified Mr. Cohen, but also

20

named his employer — gratuitously named his employer,

21

Justice Blackmun.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ROTHENBERG:

Who was his employer?
Martin Williams Company, a

24

major Minneapolis advertising company which of course does

25

work for political figures and for the Government.

They

1

felt that because of what has happened — because of their

2

being named — that they had to fire Mr. Cohen, and that

3

of course is found by the jury and the Minnesota Court of

4

Appeals and the Minnesota Supreme Court pointed out in

5

their decisions that this is no longer an issue in the

case, that this was conceded by the newspapers.
