ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. WILLARD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WILLARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The first question in this case is whether a

12

State long arm statute constitutionally can reach a

13

nonresident defendant in a case involving an out-of-state

14

accident based on the defendant's advertising and

15

promotional activities within the State.

16

a general jurisdiction case.

17

Now this is not

Both courts below found that Carnival had not

18

engaged in the kind of continuous and systematic contacts

19

with the State of Washington that would support an

20

assertion of general jurisdiction, and the plaintiff has

21

not chosen to raise that issue before this Court.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, you say this question

23

you're about to discuss is the first question in the case

24

Is it necessarily the first?

MR. WILLARD:

1

Each question, Justice Scalia, is

2

independent and the Court could certainly resolve the case

3

in our favor by deciding the second issue, the second

4

question presented —

MR. WILLARD:

constitutional question.

11

12

That is correct.

The Court has certainly indicated

that that is appropriate.
I would propose, if the Court pleases, to go

15
16

ahead with the first question presented, although I

17

understand that they're both independent issues.

18

QUESTION:

Please do so.

19

MR. WILLARD:

The court of appeals, although it

20

rejected generalist jurisdiction, found specific

21

jurisdiction, because it said there was a sufficient nexus

22

in this case between the Carnival's advertising activities

23

in the State of Washington and the resulting — and the

24

ultimate accident.

causation.

They applied a test of but for

1

advertising and promotional activities, Mrs. Shute would

2

not have gone on this cruise and but for going on the

3

cruise, of course, she would not have been injured.

4

We submit that this connection is too tenuous to

5

support the assertion of jurisdiction.

And we recognize

6

the State of Washington has an interest in providing a

7

forum for its residents who may want to pursue claims for

8

injuries they have suffered while traveling out of State.

9

But this Court has never held that that kind of interest

10

is sufficient to support an assertion of jurisdiction over

11

a nonresident defendant.
No matter how strong the State's interest in

12

13

providing a convenient forum for its plaintiffs to pursue

14

claims, those claims still must arise out of or relate to

15

contacts with the forum State by the defendant in order to

16

support an assertion of long arm jurisdiction.

17

This Court has been mindful of the territorial

18

limits on State power in connection with the assertion of

19

personal jurisdiction, and those territorial contacts here

20

are pretty close to their nadir.

21

nonresident corporation that does not have continuous and

22

systematic contacts in a case involving acts of negligence

Here we have a

Thus, this case is readily distinguishable for

1
2

libellous publications into a State or may send a
■defective product into a State where it causes injury.

In

3

this case, all of the acts on which liability is based and

4

all of the injuries that support the claim for damages

5

occurred out-of-state.

6

The sole contact of the defendant with the State

7

involved the advertising and promotional activities and

8

the relationship between these activities and the

9

allegations of negligence and failing to maintain a safe

10

passageway through the galley are so slight, as to create

11

really a virtual fiction.

12

This case is many ways like the case of Kulko

13

against Superior Court.

14

recalled, you rejected an assertion of jurisdiction in a

15

case where, admittedly, the marriage of the parties had

16

originated in California during a brief visit, but

17

thereafter they moved to New York.

18

back to California and the Court held that California

19

could not assert long arm jurisdiction over the husband,

20

who had remained in New York.

21

In that case, as the Court

Later, the wife moved

Now it could be said that the marriage in that

22

case was a but for cause of the subsequent lawsuit to

23

establish a divorce decree, since but for a marriage you

But the Court did not devote much

1

consider the thought that the prior marriage in

2

California, even though that sort of a but for cause could

3

form the basis for the establishment of long arm

4

jurisdiction over the husband in a lawsuit involving,

5

among other things, child support and establishment of the

6

marriage decree.

7

So, for those reasons, we would submit that the

8

contacts here were too tenuous and unrelated to the cause

9

of action to support an assertion of personal

10

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

11

The complaint alleges negligence,

12

does it not?

13

cause of action, but the complaint alleged negligence.

14

the plaintiff here were — had shown that she relied on

15

the advertising to find the safe and reliable ship line,

16

could you say that there's some connection between the

17

negligence cause of action and the advertising that she

18

saw?

19

just to test whether or not it's arising out of or related

20

to.

21

I'm not sure that that's necessary for the
If

I recognize that those aren't shown in the case, but

MR. WILLARD:

Well, certainly, Justice Kennedy,

22

if she were to sue on the basis of fraudulent or false

23

advertising, that would be like the Keeton case in which

24

the contact with the forum gave rise to the cause of

25

action, because the advertising itself would cause the

1

injury.
In your hypothetical, though, the advertising

2

3

would not be a necessary part of the cause of action.

4

might allege that the advertising promised a safe ship.

5

But of course she could sue for negligence whether the

6

advertising promised a safe ship or not.

7

QUESTION:

She

Well, but the context — do the

8

context have to be necessary to the cause of action under

9

your test?

10
11

It has to be related to I thought our cases

say.
MR. WILLARD:

In our view it has to have a

12

substantive relationship.

13

the substance of the cause of action and not just a sort

14

of a narrative relationship in which it's something that

15

is part of the story that's told.

16

could have drafted her complaint in a way that might have

17

indicated that the advertising somehow contained a promise

18

of a safe ship, unless she were actually suing for a

19

breach of warranty or something like that, it would be

20

necessary to a cause of action for negligence.

21

QUESTION:

That is, it should relate to

And so, although she

Mr. Willard, what if you — I

22

understood your brief to suggest that the outcome here

23

would be different if the cause of action had been for

24

breach of contract.

25

there was a warranty of safety implicit in the undertaking

Suppose they'd simply claimed that

1

so that instead of suing in tort, they are suing in

2

assumpsit.
MR. WILLARD:

3

Well, that would be certainly a

4

stronger case for the assertion of specific jurisdiction

5

where the act took place in the forum.

6

however, this is not an issue that could be resolved

7

simply by clever pleading.

8

a paragraph in the complaint that talked about the

9

advertising as somehow containing an implied

And in our view,

In other words, simply putting

10

representation would not be enough unless it were actually

11

a lawsuit based on that theory.

12

basis for asserting that kind of theory in this case.
QUESTION:

13

In our view, there's no

May I ask this?

This accident took

14

place in international waters, as I understand it.

15

it correct that under your view of the proper causation,

16

the only places in the United States where the defendant

17

could be use would be where general jurisdiction would be

18

available?

19

MR. WILLARD:

So is

That would be our general view,

20

although it's certainly possible that there would be a

21

situation where some act of negligence in another case

22

would have taken place -- correct.

23

QUESTION:

No, I'm talking about this case,

24

where the act of negligence allegedly was she slipped in

MR. WILLARD:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

So that even if the ship had docked

3

in Seattle but still not often enough to support general

4

jurisdiction, but she had gotten on board the ship and

5

sailed, and so that still would not justify it then?

6

MR. WILLARD:

That would be our position here,

7

because there's no allegation of an act of negligence on

8

the land portion of the journey.

9
10

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. WILLARD:

The allegation is that water was

11

spilled on the galley during the cruise, and so all of the

12

acts occurred outside of any State.

13

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the cruise ship operate

14

out of Los Angeles though?

15

been sufficient jurisdiction in the superior court of Los

16

Angeles County or the central district of California?

17

MR. WILLARD:

I mean, might there not have

Our view is, Mr. Chief Justice,

18

there would not be, although there would certainly be a

19

stronger tie there.

20

the acts of negligence occur out of State and all of the

21

injury occurs out of State, that the mere fact that the

22

cruise began and ended in the State would not be enough.

But in our view where the — all of

23

QUESTION:

Well, where could the plaintiff sue?

24

MR. WILLARD:

25

QUESTION:

Well, it could sue —

Anywhere?

Nowhere?

The plaintiff could sue anywhere

where she could obtain general jurisdiction over the --

3

QUESTION:

Well, where is that, for example?

4

MR. WILLARD:

In this case, it's Florida which

5

is where Carnival has its principal place of business and

6

also where, in the forum selection clause in the ticket,

7

it is implicitly consented to jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

8
9

For the purposes of our analysis and

yours on this part of the case, would it make any

10

difference if she could not have sued in Florida, if she

11

would have had to go to a foreign country?

13

MR. WILLARD:

Or is the

In our view the analysis is the

14

same.

15

of service for foreign defendants in this kind of a case,

16

and so as long as Rule 4(e) provides that the State long

17

arm statute is the basis for service of process, this

18

Court's decision in the Omni case indicates that that

19

would be the form of analysis.

20

The — Congress has never provided a special rule

We certainly don't suggest Congress is

21

constitutionally required to adopt that, and it could if

22

it chose adopt a special rule for service of foreign

23

defendants.

24
25

But it has not done so in this situation.

I had indicated that there is one place for sure
where Carnival could be sued, and that is Florida.

And

1

that's because it has its principal place of business

2

there, and as the second issue in the case indicates,

3

there is a provision in the passenger ticket requiring

4

litigation to take place in the State of Florida.

5

Ninth Circuit and the respondents in this case make two

6

arguments as to why this clause should be not enforced.

7

The first argument is a very broad one, which

8

apparently is that ticket conditions of this nature are

9

never enforceable, because passenger tickets are
They're contracts of adhesion.,

10

preprinted.

11

offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

12

Now the

They're

And then their second argument is that even if

13

this kind of a clause is sometimes enforceable, here in

14

this particular case it's so unreasonable and burdensome

15

that it should not be enforced.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, before you get into

17

those two arguments, is it clear to you and should it be

18

clear to us that this is a question of purely Federal law

19

and it doesn't matter how the State of Washington would

20

have treated this forum selection clause?

21

MR. WILLARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

This Court has

22

regarded this issue as one of Federal admiralty law, and I

23

see no —

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WILLARD:

When did we do that?
Well, The Majestic, which of

QUESTION:

MR. WILLARD:

I don't believe this — well,

under Bremen, the Court viewed that --

QUESTION:

8

MR. WILLARD:

9

Do you know a

case where the point was argued where we've decided that?

5
6

What about post-Erie?

It wasn't argued.
If it wasn't argued in the Bremen,

then this Court hasn't decided it.

But I don't see any

10

reason why it should be a doubtful proposition when you're

11

dealing with a question within the Court's admiralty and

12

maritime jurisdiction.

13

admiralty law is viewed as Federal law, and in fact the

14

Court did indicate in the Bremen the importance of having

15

uniform Federal law for admiralty and that certainly was

16

one of the reasons the Constitution made that an item of

17

Federal jurisdiction.

that would indicate that that would be questionable.

1

following the State of Washington, the State of

2

Washington, had this suit been brought in State courts,

3

would have to follow our view of the effectiveness of the

4

forum selection clause.
MR. WILLARD:

5

Well, that raises a slightly

6

different question as to whether a suit brought under the

7

Savings to Suitors Clause in State court, whether the

8

state court would be required to apply Federal admiralty

9

law.

I think there are a couple of decisions from the

10

early part of the 20th century that indicate that that

11

would be the case.

12

true, but again that's not specifically prevented —

13

presented here.

14

State court would be required to follow Federal law on the

15

enforceability of a forum selection clause in that kind of

16

a suit.

17
18
19

And that's generally thought to be

I think the better view would be that the

QUESTION:

Is that somewhat at odds with the

Erie principle?
MR. WILLARD:

In our view it's not at all at

20

odds with the Erie principle, because this falls in the

21

area of admiralty and maritime law where there is a very

22

strong need which the framers of the Constitution

23

recognized to have a uniform body of law.

24

would be strange to think that the States would be

25

empowered to make up their own rules of admiralty law and

It certainly

1

very burdensome to the orderly conduct of maritime

2

business to have different States having different laws

3

that would apply here.
The — with regard to the broader issue of

4
5

whether, as a matter of Federal Admiralty law, this kind

6

of provision should ever be enforced, there's a

7

longstanding body of case law that holds that ticket

8

conditions are valid if they're reasonably communicated.

9

And in this case the respondents do not challenge that

10

these conditions were reasonably communicated within the

11

meaning of that body of law.

12

Their argument is, instead, that they just

13

should never be enforced.

In this regard, there is a

14

statute, the Limited Liability Act, that regulates but

15

does not outlaw ticket provisions in steamship passenger

16

tickets.

17

The law says the ticket condition of this nature

QUESTION:

This is a Federal statute?

19

MR. WILLARD:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

Limited Liability Acts, sections 183(b) and (c) which is

21

cited in the briefs, provides that ticket conditions

have a forum selection clause in a ticket.
In our view, when Congress chose in this

2

3

particular area to regulate ticket conditions to a certain

4

extent, but chose not to prohibit forum selection clauses,

5

this Court should not go further and on its own outlaw

6

forum selection clauses, or for that matter, particularly

7

on a theory that ticket conditions are products of

8

contracts of adhesion.

9

To the fallback argument in this case that

10

petitioners make is that even if forum selection clauses

11

are generally all right, that Florida is an unreasonable

12

and burdensome forum in this case.

13

here really confuses what would be a proper forum, non

14

conveniens-type analysis with the question of whether or

15

not the contractual forum choice should be enforced.

question here is not is Florida the most reasonable forum,

17

but is the — Florida such an unreasonable forum that the

contractual choice should be disregarded.

Now, if all of them could go home and litigate

judicial efficiency as well as reducing its costs by

providing that all the litigation should take place in one

One is — my client paid her money

Carnival's assertion is that, because the ticket
