ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRUCK:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

13

This case appears here for the third time.

14

two prior occasions this Court has ordered the South

15

Carolina Supreme Court in this capital murder case to

16

grant the relief which Federal law requires.

17

consideration, the second remand by this Court, the South

18

Carolina Supreme Court has now, by a 3 to 2 vote, held the

19

two unconstitutional burden-shifting jury presumptions of

20

an essential element of malice in this case to be harmless

21

error, and the propriety of that harmless error

22

determination is now the issue before this Court today.

23

The case, as the Court is already well aware,

s

On its third

24

involves an accomplice liability prosecution in which Dale

25

Yates was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a

1

homicide which was committed by his accomplice, one Henry

2

Davis, during the course of a robbery, after the time when

3

Yates had already yelled to Davis to leave the scene, had

4

himself left the store, and was either waiting in the car

5

outside or had already fled the area.

6

was then shot to death by the sole surviving witness to

7

the homicide, one Willie Wood, moments after the decedent

8

was stabbed and died.

Davis, of course,

9

The State supreme court has found the

10

instructions on malice to have been harmless error on the

11

grounds that identifying really for the first time 8 years

12

after the trial the real issue in the case to have been

13

whether or not Davis, the actual killer, entertained

14

malice, and not whether Mr. Yates entertained malice.

15

then having thus, shall we say clarified, and I would

16

submit really changed the issue that was placed before the

17

jury at trial, into one concerning whether Davis

18

entertained malice when he killed the victim, the court

19

then simply grossly misread the simple record facts before

20

the jury in order to find that malice — that Davis'

21

malice was overwhelmingly proven.

22

And

The particular misreadings, I think, which

23

provide the simplest and best basis upon which this case

24

should be decided are simply that the State supreme court

25

found that Davis lunged at Mrs. Wood with his knife, and

1

that he inflicted a multiple stabbing which resulted in

2

her death.

3

Davis lunged at Mrs. Wood.

4

unclear and unsatisfactory evidence from Willie Wood, the

5

only surviving witness, indicates that it was Mrs. Wood

6

who reached for or grabbed Mr. Davis from the side or from

7

the rear, and then seconds later she was stabbed through

8

the heart.

9

In fact the record contains no evidence that

QUESTION:

Indeed the very vague and

At this point or at some convenient

10

point in your argument could you comment on the argument

11

of the amicus that once evidence of the use of the knife

12

is introduced the presumption of malice disappears under

13

State law in any event?

14

that argument correctly.

15

MR. BRUCK:

I take it I am characterizing

Yes.

Of course, I think that is a

16

rather belated attempt to save what is — in any event

17

what the South Carolina Supreme Court has found to be a

18

burden-shifting and unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable

19

presumption of malice.

20

course, that the State, as respondent, has made no such

21

argument in this case, either in the brief in opposition

22

or in their brief.

23

The — and I would note, of

But in any event, if the Court were to wish to

24

revisit that underlying claim, I think one would be forced

25

to conclude that there is -- to say that in a case in

1

which the defendant was not present when the killing

2

occurred, when there was only one witness, the State's

3

witness, who himself did not see — Willie Wood did not

4

see the stabbing.

5

that — it cannot fairly be said that the circumstances

6

attending the use of the knife were brought out in

7

evidence.

8

knife was used, whether Mrs. Wood was stabbed when she

9

lunged at Henry Davis, whether he was flailing in some way

trying to get away from the man that was about to put five

bullets in him and kill him when he accidentally stabbed

presumption.

17

So it is not fair to say that the —

I think the real term is a fly away

QUESTION:

the doubt as to Davis — certainly as to Yates, the full

How he fired, it went through the hand, lodged in the

chest, and so forth.

5

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

7

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, of course.
That, that was quite complete.
Of course, but under South Carolina

8

law that does not create an irrebuttable or conclusive

9

presumption of malice, or it does not — the State wishes

10

to create a felony murder rule which does not exist in

11

16

evidence, including the fact, the State argued vigorously

17

at trial that this was a, an intent to kill scheme from

18

the beginning, and that was how the case was tried.

19

was the issue that was — that was joined.

So the

QUESTION:

1

Well, but you're talking about malice

2

— you're not contending that malice, for purposes of

3

South Carolina law, means intent to kill?

4

MR. BRUCK:

No, it does not.

It — in this case

5

it was tried as intent to kill.

The judge used the term

6

malice interchangeably with intent to kill all the way

7

through his instructions, as I pointed out in the reply

8

brief.

9

other than a specific intent to kill a particular

There are other ways in which malice can be shown,

10

individual.

11

both because they were not charged to the jury in this

12

case.

13

However, they are not relevant to this case,

There are two basic theories that the State

14

tries to bring up at this late date.

15

depraved heart murder.

16

recklessness so extreme that it would be tantamount to

17

intent, and that it would support an inference of malice.

18

And that's, really — the State basically concedes, or at

19

least fails to disagree with our contention that Davis'

20

intent to kill is not overwhelmingly proven, but they say

21

it doesn't matter because mere recklessness is enough.

22

And mere recklessness is not enough.

23

involuntary manslaughter under South Carolina law.

24

is, however, a greater degree of recklessness which is

25

known in the common law in most States, I think, and

One is so-called

That is to say a degree of

Recklessness is

There

1

certainly in South Carolina as a depraved heart murder.
But to say that you — that it is proven

3

overwhelmingly by the unsatisfactory and vague evidence in

4

this case that we are not merely dealing with criminal

5

recklessness in the handling of the knife, but depraved

6

heart malice, that it is that degree of recklessness,

7

simply is not supported by the record.

8

a fine gradation that our system of law entrusts to the

9

jury to make, it is that.

10

And as to Yates' —

11

QUESTION:

If ever there was

I think it's more than being

12

reckless, isn't it, to go into a store with a knife in

13

your hand, and when someone tries to stop the robbery, to

14

struggle with a knife in your hand and end up the struggle

15

with the knife lodged in somebody's heart?

16

condemn that as reckless action?

17

reckless, isn't it?

18

MR. BRUCK:

I mean, you

That's much more than

Well, reckless, you know, is —

19

under South Carolina — is more than negligence.

20

— it is a state of extreme indifference to human life.

21

QUESTION:

It is an

Well, isn't that the case when you —

22

when you commit a store robbery with a knife in your hand

23

and struggle when someone tries to stop the robbery with

24

the knife in your hand, even if you don't intentionally

25

plunge it into someone's heart, struggle in such a fashion

1

that that's the result?

2

MR. BRUCK:

I do not contend that the jury could

3

not reach that conclusion.

4

there.

5

QUESTION:

I concede that the evidence is

Could it reach any other conclusion,

6

other than this is the kind of thing that, other than an

7

absolute intent to kill, which is covered

8

requirement?

9

MR. BRUCK:

by the intent

Yes, in all candor I just have to

10

say that I think a jury could reach the conclusion that

11

while it was reckless for him to have been in the

12

situation, for him to be accosted from the side or from

13

the rear by someone that he may not have even known was

14

there, is not evidence that as a matter of law or that

15

conclusively establishes the depraved and malignant heart.

16

That's the language.

17

that is required.

18

so extreme that it is taken in the law to

19

intent, to be tantamount to intent.

20

That is the level of recklessness

It is — it is a level

of recklessness
be the same as

Now again, I do not deny that the evidence might

21

support or would support that if the jury took that view.

22

But to say that it is overwhelmingly proven, I just don't

23

think is supported by this record.

24

the supreme court yielded to the temptation to exaggerate

25

the record.

And I think that's why

Now a multiple stabbing is evidence par

2

no multiple stabbing, and there was no lunging.
QUESTION:

4

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

There was

a single narrow wound to the chest.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BRUCK:

9

Does the evidence show how many

wounds were inflicted on Mrs. Woods?

5
6

The only trouble is that there was

Nothing else?
Nothing else.

The, this was a very

thoroughly prosecuted case, but the prosecutor did not

10

press on to determine even such details as the amount of

11

force that might be required to inflict that wound.

12

thus the jury would be quite capable -- it would be quite

13

reasonable for the jury to conclude that this could have

14

been an accidental stabbing, rather than the brutal,

15

vicious, multiple stabbing described without evidentiary

16

basis by the State supreme court.

And

17

Because the State supreme court so exaggerated

18

this record evidence, I would submit that this really is

19

all — as far as this Court need go to decide this case.

20

There was a jury issue as to what happened in that store.

21

The event is entirely depicted through circumstantial

22

evidence.

23

cannot fairly be said that a jury would have had to have

24

found Davis' intent beyond a reasonable doubt simply from

25

the fragments of testimony that were offered by Willie

I'd further point out that Mr. Wood, although

And in addition, Mr. Wood had

10

that would have made that homicide justifiable.

11

not to say that it wasn't justifiable, it's simply to say

12

that a jury could reasonably have been somewhat critical

13

in evaluating Mr. Davis' testimony, and might reasonably

14

have wondered whether they were getting a picture of what

15

happened in that store, sketchy as it was, that was so

16

reliable as to establish malice beyond a reasonable doubt.

17

QUESTION:

That's

Tell me, what did the — did the

18

supreme court in this latest round here say it was

19

harmless error because the jury — there was so much

evidence of Davis' —

MR. BRUCK:

5

MR. BRUCK:

7

They said

that Yates' mental state doesn't matter; it's irrelevant.

6

That's exactly right.

Because this is an accomplice case?
Because this is an accomplice case.

Now, there are —
QUESTION:

But, I suppose under our cases the

8

person who is sentenced to death must have himself or

9

herself intended to kill somebody?

10

MR. BRUCK:

Yes, well, the court below got

11

around that by saying that well, he did intend to kill

12

somebody, or at least the jury could have concluded that

13

because he fired at someone else, at Willie Wood, and shot

14

him through his out stretched hand and the bullet landed

15

in his pocket.

16

South Carolina Supreme Court —

So that is enough to support, so said the

all they needed to do was to find that Davis was culpable?

22

after Enmund, and the court did its own review — made its

23

own Enmund findings in effect on direct appeal, and said

that Yates had a sufficiently — that of course is a case,

25

this — which — that is an issue which awaits review on

1

Federal habeas, although I hope we don't have to go there.
QUESTION:

2

So you're just arguing mainly here

3

that there just — it couldn't have been harmless error

4

because there was so little evidence?
MR. BRUCK:

5

Is that it?

Well, that's the first — that's the

6

first and I would submit the easiest way of disposing of

7

this case.

8

wasn't evidence that conclusively or overwhelmingly

9

established malice under all the facts and circumstances.

10

I shouldn't say so little.

There simply

The jury could have had — could have had a doubt.

11

If the Court were not to accept that view,

12

though, and were to agree with the South Carolina Supreme

13

Court, even when we take away all of the exaggeration on

14

which the State supreme court's opinion and judgment

15

actually rest, we then come to another rather serious

16

problem, which is that it is most unlikely in this case

17

that the jury understood its task to make any evaluation

18

of Davis' malice, for the simple reason that they were

19

never told to do so.

20

On the contrary, the — most of the

21

instructions, all except a single little fragment that

22

that State stakes its whole case on, clearly refer to

23

Yates and to Yates' mental state, which would be a

24

plausible way under South Carolina of prosecuting this

25

case.

The court — the trial court charged at the

beginning of the malice instructions that in order to

convict one of murder the State must not only prove the

3

killing of the deceased by the defendant, but that it was

done with malice aforethought.

5

deceased by the defendant, that is Mr. Yates, and that it

was done with malice.

IU.

^

QUESTION:

7

T

The killing of the

But the court's instruction said,

8

"And it ultimately remains the responsibility for you,

9

ladies and gentlemen, under all the evidence to make a

10

determination as to whether malice existed in the mind and

11

heart of the killer at the time the fatal blow was

12

struck."

13

MR. BRUCK:

14

QUESTION:

15

would think that —

16

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.
That doesn't refer to Yates.

No, it doesn't.

Nobody

That is the

17

fragment on which the court relies.

There are several

18

things I would like to say about that.

19

the jury would have understood the term killer to refer to

20

defendant, because it's — the court is referring at the

21

beginning of that same instruction to must prove the

22

killing of the deceased by the defendant.

23

once they have proven the killing of the deceased in some

24

legal way by the law of parties by Yates, he becomes, for

25

purposes of these instructions, the killer.

The first is that

And therefore

It's clear

1

that the jury couldn't have made any sense of these

2

instructions and applied them at all, unless they were

3

willing to treat Yates as the killer that the judge was

4

talking about.

5

I would further point out that that instruction

6

came before the judge even got to the subject of

7

accomplice liability, so it's unlikely that when the jury

8

heard that instruction they understood it in any way to

9

refer to the mental state of Davis.

10

I think what that —

the jury most likely would have understood, and certainly

11

there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have

12

understood that what that instruction meant was at the

13

time of the killing they had to look at the intent of the

14

person on trial, the defendant, who — against whom the

15

killing had to be proven.

16

That conclusion is strengthened by the

17

prosecutor's argument in this case, which not once focused

18

on the mental state of Davis, the mental state of malice.

19

Not one word was said about that.

20

prosecutor said that by the use of the gun, by Yates' use

21

of the gun, that proved that the intent required, the

22

requisite intent -- I'm sorry, the requisite malice was in

23

his heart, that is in Yates' heart.

24

prosecutor argued the case.

25

On the contrary, the

That is the way the

clear that Yates' mental state was very much in dispute.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. SHEALY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

The record proves in this case that any error in

7

the malice instruction is factually harmless.

8

there is no reason why this Court should not give effect

9

to the natural and common sense conclusion that the error

As such

10

is immaterial.

The petitioner has shown no good reason

11

why an error which is factually harmless should be legally

12

prejudicial.
The South Carolina Supreme Court in deciding

13
14

this case properly found that Davis' malice was the key

15

for the whole crime.

16

Clark and under Chapman v. California, that the malice

instruction here would not have had to have been relied

upon by the jury to conclude that Davis did in fact have

MR. SHEALY:

Your Honor, I think following the

2

harmless error analysis here the court in essence has

3

concluded that the evidence is so overwhelming of Davis'

malice that the jury would not have had to do that.

the proper test of harmless error is it merely that it

would not have been necessary to rely on the instructions,

instructions could not have made a difference?

15

MR. SHEALY:

I think it, the proper test would

be beyond a reasonable doubt the instructions would not

is so overwhelming.

MR. SHEALY:

Again, I would say it's -- a

strange turn of phrase, but I think in the cases they

cited and the way they wrote the opinion I would argue

8

that — not focus on that one bit of language, that they

9

had to consider the whole record here under Rose v. Clark,

10

and properly decided the case.

saying, but I simply think when one takes the whole

12

opinion in context, the way they recite the facts, the way

13

they state the facts, I think it's perfectly —

is clearly harmless error.

I think, once again, the facts

2

of Davis' malice, they are both in the store, they both

3

have a deadly weapon, they both demanded money from Willie

4

Wood.

5

And a key point about Davis' malice which the

6

petitioner didn't bring out in oral argument is that it

7

was Davis who instructed Yates to fire the shots at Willie

8

Wood.

9

murder but of assault and battery with intent to kill,

10

armed robbery, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.

11

The record is clear.

12

shoots and hits Willie Wood twice, and was convicted of

13

assault and battery with intent to kill on Willie Wood for

14

that crime.

15

excuse me, Davis' malice, and his intent throughout this

16

whole crime.

Yates was ultimately convicted also not just of

Davis says to Yates, shoot.

Yates

That is also evidence of Yates' malice —

17

So we would submit it is clearly harmless error.

18

There is just no other reasonable conclusion that the jury

19

could have drawn.

What you really mean is you don't

even need the jury, don't you?

What about whether this presumption

MR. SHEALY:

Well, here again this concerns the

South Carolina law of accomplice liability.

8

speaking, Yates' mental state as far — is not relevant as

9

far as Helen Wood is concerned.

Strictly

Yates is guilty under the

law of accomplice liability, and I would direct the Court

11

to the Joint Appendix on page 150, if I might, where the

12

law of accomplice liability is defined by the South

13

Carolina Supreme Court in the case below.

14

What the jury in essence has to find is that

15

these two men combined together to commit an unlawful act,

16

in this case armed robbery, that a killing arose out of

17

this, and that — has to find as a matter of fact that as

a natural and probable consequence of this combination of

this crime and the way it was committed, that a killing

20

was likely to result.

convict Yates of murder, that he specifically intended the

22

death result or subjectively expected that one was likely.

They must merely find that it was, given the way the crime

occurred and the nature of the crime, that one was quite

likely to in fact occur.

Not only is the language

more parties combine together to commit an unlawful act,

facts and the testimony of Willie Wood very carefully, I

QUESTION :

MR. BRUCK:

(Inaudible)?
Well, they probably found it aided

3

by the instruction, the shared malice, if you will.

4

that's why — that's one of the several ways in which this

5

instruction was prejudicial, because they could reach that

6

conclusion, that crucial conclusion in order to bind Yates

7

to the homicide of Ms. Wood by saying, well, we're

8

supposed to presume malice from the use of the deadly

9

weapon —

10

QUESTION:

And

Well, suppose — do you think it was

11

harmless error to — do you think that presumption was

12

harmless error with respect to Davis?

13

MR. BRUCK:

Absolutely not, for the reasons I

14

have indicated, that it is not clear — it requires either

15

intent to kill or something very, very close to intent to

16

kill under South Carolina law, notwithstanding that a

17

felony is being committed.

18

no, we do not have felony murder.

19

to the killing itself.

QUESTION:

Another way of putting it is,
The malice must relate

Obviously any robbery has —

Suppose Davis was still around and

21

they both were on trial, and all this happened, they were

22

both convicted under these presumptions.

23

would have been error to hold that this presumption

24

instruction was harmless error with respect to Davis?

25

MR. BRUCK:

Do you think it

Well, yes, I think so, but we would

QUESTION:

Let's assume that it wouldn't have,

it wouldn't have.

error with respect to Yates?

5

Would you say it was still harmless

MR. BRUCK:

I would say that it was not harmless

6

error, because I don't think that this jury clearly

7

focused on Davis' mental state in order to convict Yates.

8

And you simply — it's very difficult — it may be

9

possible to parse these instructions through hours of

10

careful study to find a way in which the jury focused on

11

Davis' intent, but I doubt very seriously that that's what

12

this jury did.

13

The best that can be said, I mean, we argue our

14

inference and the State argues theirs, and we each say

15

that it's clear.

16

looking at these instructions and the way this case was

17

tried is that it was a confused, tangled mess, and we

18

really don't know what happened.

19

I think probably the fairest way of

In order for this man to have been accorded his

20

Sixth Amendment jury trial right, I think the dissenting

21

opinion below, Justice Toal's opinion, was exactly right

22

when she said that from the confusing instructions the

23

jury might — probably concluded that it was Yates' malice

24

that had to be determined, and that would naturally have

25

been prejudiced by the — by the two, by either or both of

That is the

And I will, you know, I will concede that there
