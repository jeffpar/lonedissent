ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. SUTHERLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SUTHERLIN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case of Kathy Burns presents the — this

10
11

Court with the opportunity to clarify and refine its

12

holding in the landmark case of Imbler.
QUESTION:

14

You are not say to (inaudible), just

an opportunity.

15

MR. SUTHERLIN:

An opportunity, yes, Your Honor'

16

For reason of public policy and practicality, I

17

will respectfully urge upon the Court that a bright-line

18

test can be established to help resolve the conflicts in

19

the circuits and to clarify some of the ambiguities that

20

are inherent in trying to discern conduct which is not

21

essential to the initiation of filing formal criminal

22

charges.

23

The bright-line test which I would respectfully

24

urge the Court to consider is as follows.

25

conduct which is the exclusive prerogative of the

prosecutor, such as the filing of formal charges and

absolute immunity.

4

formal charges should be protected by the substantial

protection of qualified immunity.

6

QUESTION:

Conduct which precedes the filing of

Excuse me, when you say the exclusive

7

prerogative of the prosecutor, you mean under the

particular Sta-te law in question.

was the only one who could have issued an arrest warrant?

Suppose the prosecutor

Would that come within your -- in this particular State,

11

would that come within your test?

12

MR. SUTHERLIN:

Justice Scalia, I think that the

13

functional approach and the review of the common law which

14

suggests that that would be taken into account in a

15

primary way.

16

the only one who could file a petition or a request for a

17

warrant, then that particular conduct, the exclusive

18

prerogative of that office, would be deserving of the

19

protection of absolute immunity.

If the prosecutor of that jurisdiction were

Justice Kennedy, I believe that

suggested that the application of a search warrant was

the Court has employed in all types of immunity cases,

14

that it would make no difference as to the other parties

15

who may be involved in seeking a search warrant.

16

the prosecutor were the only one, he would be entitled to

absolutely immunity.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

But if

So that departs

19

somewhat from what I -- at least I thought I hear you say

-- said that it has to do with reference to the filing of

charges, and charges are not filed routinely with the

application of a search warrant.

QUESTION:

I did say arrest warrant.

2

MR. SUTHERLIN:

3

For reasons of public policy and practicality,

Yes.

All right.

4

the bright-line test which I have proposed would eliminate

5

many of the problems which are addressed by the Seventh

6

Circuit and many other circuits.

7

considerations are essentially that any — anything which

8

will ensure and enhance the integrity of the judicial

9

process promotes the common good and is to be preferred

10

The public policy

over the unfettered power of the prosecutor's office.

11

In the Seventh Circuit, there was the approach

12

taken that giving advice would be protected by absolute

13

immunity because the Court deemed that to be quasi­

14

judicial.

15

problem which would exist even if this Court were to adopt

16

that.

17

definitional debate, of what constitutes advice versus

18

what constitutes investigation or directing an

19

investigation.

20

That approach does not resolve the continuing

There would still be the very subjective debate,

The factual assumptions are insupportable that

21

would lead one to conclude that if absolute immunity were

22

not extended to such conduct as giving advice that the

23

prosecutor would be hesitant to give such advice and would

24

be flooded with a deluge of litigation, civil rights

25

litigation.

The 14 years following Imbler suggest the

contrary is true.

interpreted Imbler in a rather restrictive way, allowing

The majority of circuits have

One .could then argue, reasonably, that in those
circuits, and the majority of them have been I think

applying Imbler in a restrictive fashion, one could argue

of activity against prosecutors in those jurisdictions and

suggests that these circuits are handicapped or burdened

QUESTION:

There is no -- been no

Well, what about -- well, maybe

18

that's because prosecutors don't give advice in those

circuits.

MR. SUTHERLIN:

23

That is possible, Your Honor.

Well, I mean they're probably obeying

— they're probably avoiding a risk.
MR. SUTHERLIN:

The idea of giving advice,

the judicial officer — what's the purpose of giving him

more than qualified immunity?

9

MR. .SUTHERLIN:

It would impede his ability to

make impartial and objective judgements.

He might be

10

hesitant to rule on the merits and might be fearful of the

11

outcome, seeing the potential of liability.

12

judicial immunity that was found appropriate and was

13

clarified in the case of Forrester, that is, if it's not

14

an essential judicial function but an administrative

15

function, then you do not need to protect that activity

with absolute immunity, but only qualified immunity, which

QUESTION:

How can it be a close call in

4

identifying what you've just said isn't too hard a thing,

5

a clearly established law?

6

MR. SUTHERLIN:

Oftentimes, it is difficult to

7

discern on the spot what clearly defined law is.

But if

8

it is a close -call under the objective standard, the

9

prosecutor is protected.

In other words, he's not

10

cautioned to withdraw from the edge of what that clearly

11

defined standard is.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

It also keeps him out of litigation,

absolute immunity does.
MR. SUTHERLIN:

Well, absolute immunity would

15

keep him out of litigation, but it would not promote the

16

public good and would not serve any legitimate public

17

policy interest.

18

What we want -- what is primarily in -- is to be

protected in the prosecutor's office — is his function of

the court -- I mean, it seems to me that that's more like

an appearance with reference to an arrest warrant than it

MR. SUTHERLIN:

Justice Kennedy, I think that

what hat the person is wearing, but what the function

under scrutiny truly is.

And if a police officer can come

or is found to be an inappropriate act, exposing him to

inconsistent and impractical to then say to the prosecutor

(Inaudible) this fellow — here's

MR. SUTHERLIN:

That is correct, Justice White,

21

and that's as it should be because he is — he is charged

22

with being an impartial magistrate, determining whether or

MR. SUTHERLIN:

In this country anybody can be

sued for the cost of a filing fee.

protecting that officer from being involved and protracted

5

litigation would permit the motion to dismiss, the motion

for summary judgment, and trial Rule 11 sanctions would

caution any practitioner to be quite careful about his

8

allegations.

But the process of

There are adequate protections, but to extend

9
10

absolute immunity to this particular prosecutor, Mr. Reed,

11

for the conduct under scrutiny, would be to suggest that

12

almost anything that a prosecutor does prior to filing

13

formal charges would be protected.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutherlin, why — let's explore

15

that.

16

carving out judges as an exception to the normal rule of

is that that is what produces the likelihood of constant

particular case, all the conduct preceded any judicial

Cathy Burns, contrary to the advice of the police officer

which suggested by his training that it was improper and

The prosecutor gave permission to hypnotize

contrary to the prohibitions of the Fifth Amendment.

This

particular prosecutor then went down and viewed a

12

videotape of the forensic hypnosis and by all accounts

13

violated every professional and ethical protocol,

14

including the post-hypnotic suggestion that she would not

15

remember any of the activities under hypnosis and that she

16

would cooperate fully with the police.
That conduct was followed by a discussion on

17
18

whether or not to make the source of this so-called

19

interpretation of a confession public.

20

Mr. Reed, with Officer Scroggins, presented to the court a

21

dishonest statement of the basis for seeking a search

All of that preceded the filing of any formal

It would have been just as harmful, just as

rather than the other?
MR. SUTHERLIN:

In most competing interests

12

where one right could be, say, trampled by a governmental

13

objective, there must be a balancing.

14

particular case, the balance would have resulted in a

15

finding that if Mr. Reed had sought the authority of the

16

court and had obtained an indictment, then from that

17

point, that is, the filing of the indictment and from that

18

point one his conduct would be absolutely immune, because

2

before there was a formal filing of the charge, because in

3

seeking the warrant for arrest, there was still no mention

The common law

suggests that the prosecutor enjoys immunity but not

12

Indiana, for example, the prosecutor is defined as a law

14

is derived from common law, he would be exposed to a

liability for false arrest.

18

Mr. Reed was instrumental and crucial in the decision to

19

arrest Cathy Burns without a warrant, based upon his

20

opinion that there was probable cause.

21

So the common law tradition suggests that there

22

is perhaps a need to protect the essential function of the

23

prosecutor, that is, the prosecutorial function, the

24

initiation of filing formal charges and the presentation

25

of the State's case.
