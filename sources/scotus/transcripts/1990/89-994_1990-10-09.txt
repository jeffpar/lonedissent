CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Robert Casey.

Mr. Adams.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. ADAMS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ADAMS:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

The issue in this case is whether experts' fees

11

are compensable under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. section

12

1988.

13

to decide this issue in the only way that would achieve

14

Congress' stated intent to give civil rights litigants the

15

opportunity to recover what it cost them to vindicate

16

their rights in court.

17

West Virginia University Hospitals asked the Court

The fee-shifting provision in section 1988,

18

intended by Congress to be a full and complete remedy,

19

enables the Federal courts to return to their pre-Alyeska

20

fee-shifting practices, and those practices included the

21

shifting of experts' fees.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Adams, what the statute

23

says I guess is that court may allow the prevailing party

24

a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.

25

you say expert fees are attorney's fees or do you say they

Now do

are other parts of the costs?

2

MR. ADAMS:

We say that expert fees are part of

3

the attorney's fee, because they are part of the work

product.

term of art.

7

In other words, reasonable attorney's fee is a

QUESTION:

Even though concededly experts are

not attorneys.

8

MR. ADAMS:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. ADAMS:

Concededly -And they don't do attorneys' work.
Concededly they are not, but before

11

the — before the attorney can do his work, he's got to

12

work with that expert so he knows how to present his

13

client's case and how to prove it.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, that would be true of any

witness.
MR. ADAMS:

But with respect to expert

17

witnesses, it's particularlyimportant

18

dealing with civil rights litigation, it's a rare case

19

when you can have that kind of litigation go forward

20

without an expert.

21

QUESTION:

because when you're

I think the thing that drives that —
Well, that's true of -- you can say

22

that about any — you can't win a lawsuit without a

23

witness unless it's just aquestion

24
25

MR. ADAMS:

of law.

That's true, but if you have fact

witnesses you subpoena them and they come to trial and

1

they're going to testify.

Expert witnesses unfortunately

2

have rents to pay, college tuitions to pay and they

3

normally will request some fee for their services.

4

But I think the point that drives us home is the

5

fact that when Congress enacted the fee-shifting provision

6

in section 1988, it did not sail into uncharted waters.

7

Instead, it selected the language of title VII's --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, an attorney — an attorney can

certainly get — they can get attorney's fees and they can

10

recover a fee that reflects the time the attorney spent

11

with an expert witness.

12

and he forks him up, and he knows his testimony.

13

get him an attorney's fee for that.

14

included in the attorney's fees is the separate sum that

15

he must pay the expert?

16
17

MR. ADAMS:

Yes, sir, I do.

But you say that

We would

QUESTION:

And he -- and the expert is a

witness ?

20

MR. ADAMS:

21

Sometimes he is not.

22

out that all of our experts ended up testifying.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ADAMS:

25

He can

respectfully submit —

18
19

If he -- he goes and finds them

The expert can be a witness.
In this particular case it turned

Uh-huh.
We would respectfully submit to the

Court that the starting point for this Court's analysis of

1

this issue ought to be the same starting point that this

2

Court employed in the case of Missouri v. Jenkins.

3
4

QUESTION:

the same argument even if these experts did not testify?

5
6

7

9

But you would -- you would be making

MR. ADAMS:

I would be making the same argument.

Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

I guess that's — because you say the

$30 provision just doesn't cover this.
MR. ADAMS:

Just doesn't pay and quite candidly,

10

Your Honor, in today's litigation the attorney I think

11

most often goes out, finds the experts, gets them

12

acquainted with the case so they can do their work, and in

13

most instances, even though there may be the initial

14

expectation that the fee is going to be paid for by the

15

client, I can assure you that that expert is going to look

16

to that lawyer in the law firm to makes sure that he bill

17

gets paid to some extent.

18

And that's very important to a lawyer, because

19

if he is able to find quality people to be experts and all

20

of a sudden his experts don't get paid, I would submit

21

that it's going to be very hard for that attorney to

22

attract that expert again or other experts of like quality

23

when they hear that their fee is going to go unsatisfied.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Adams, I guess there are a number

of Federal statutes where there is express provision made

for expert witnesses?

2

MR. ADAMS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ADAMS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And their fees?
Yes, Your Honor.
And that was not done in section

6

1988.

7

to provide for them expressly.

8

MR. ADAMS:

9

Should that be a concern to us?

Congress knows how

I think that is probably the best

argument that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has.

But I

10

think when the argument is examined, it doesn't wash and

11

for a couple of reasons, Your Honor..

12

First of all, just as an initial matter, you

13

would have to completely ignore the legislative intent

14

behind the fee-shifting provision in section 1988.

15

Secondly, what you're really suggesting is that

16

Congress must use particular words and particular ways

17

every time it legislates.

18

into a legislative drafting straightjacket which is pretty

19

much akin to the way we used to have old common law

20

pleading, and courts and lawyers who were trained in

21

pleading found that to be an unworkable situation.

22

would submit it would not be appropriate to place Congress

23

in an equivalent situation.

24
25

QUESTION:

You effectively place Congress

And I

Well, I guess it's not unreasonable

to think that we should apply the common ordinary

1

understanding of the words that Congress does choose to

2

employ.

3

would you say?

4

That's not putting Congress in a straightjacket,

MR. ADAMS:

It is not.

But when you find plain

5

evidence of a legislative intent to work some other

6

result, then the result would be if you followed a plain

7

language construction —
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Well, but it's just a little bit of a

stretch isn't it to say an attorney's fee includes fees
paid to experts?
MR. ADAMS:

11

With respect, Your Honor, I would

12

disagree and for this reason.

13

Senate report and the House report, both reports

14

specifically comment that they are selecting title VII's

15

fee-shifting language and they say the reasons for that

16

selection -- they said, number 1, the courts are familiar

17

with these terms.

18

have given them meaning, and furthermore they cite case

19

law that have interpreted title VII's fee-shifting

20

language.

21

interpreted title VII's language to embrace experts' fees.

22

If you examine both the

They have interpreted these terms and

And when you examine that case law, they have

QUESTION:

Well, and you think that every

23

committee member who signed on to that report not only

24

read those cases and knew that that's what those cases

25

said —• that they covered not only attorney's fees but

also expert fees.

2

3

MR. ADAMS:

I think that's the presumption, Your

Honor.

4

QUESTION:

And it's also the presumption not

5

only that the other members of the Congress read those

6

committee reports, but also that the other members of

7

Congress also read those cases that were cited in the

8

committee reports, even though the committee -- as I

9

understand it the committee reports don't even say

10

explicitly that experts' fees are covered.

11

MR. ADAMS:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's correct.
All they do is cite these cases which

had held that experts' fees were covered.

14

MR. ADAMS:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And the theory of the matter is that

16

from that citation of the cases we can be sure that the

17

whole committee and the whole Congress intended expert

18

fees to be covered.

19

MR. ADAMS:

I think that's the evidence that

20

would be before the court, and I don't think there's any

21

evidence to contradict that particularly when you

22

examine --

23

QUESTION:

Well, there's the evidence of the

24

language which says attorney's fees and the evidence of

25

other statutes which say attorney's fees and expert fees

are recoverable.

Now, if I'm a member of Congress and

2

voting on that statute, I'm not going to go and read a

3

committee report and then read the cases cited in the

4

committee report.

5

attorney's fees, we mean attorney's fees and when we say

6

attorney's fees and expert fees, we mean both.

I'm going to know that when we say-

7

MR. ADAMS:

8

QUESTION:

9

Your Honor -Isn't that much more reasonable to

assume?
MR. ADAMS:

10

I would disagree.

I'm aware that

11

you in some of your opinions have approached legislative

12

history in a different way than perhaps we would --

13

QUESTION:

No, but this goes beyond legislative

14

history.

15

case which you expect the members of Congress to have

16

read.

This goes relying on nothing but the name of a

1

17

MR. ADAMS:

But I think, Your Honor, when you

18

look at the entire set of contemporaneous circumstances

19

that surrounded the enactment of this fee-shifting

20

provision, it is absolutely clear in my opinion that the

21

Congress wanted to abrogate the effects of Alyeska with

22

respect to civil rights litigation.

23

particularly concerned that when they took this

24

legislative action that they supply something that was a

25

meaningful and fully compensatory remedy.

And they were

QUESTION:
attorney's fees.

Well, Alyeska just dealt with

They didn't deal with expert witnesses.

MR. ADAMS:

Well, unfortunately I think

4

everybody concluded from reading your opinion, Justice

5

White, that it had —

8

9

QUESTION:

That wasn't my opinion.

It was the

Court's opinion.
MR. ADAMS:

You're correct, Your Honor.

But I

think everybody assumed and I believe correctly so that

10

based upon that opinion it would be a very weak argument

11

to suggest that that opinion did not reach to expert fees.

12

QUESTION:

This presumption that the members of

13

Congress or at least the committee have read all the

14

cases, have we said there's that presumption?

15

MR. ADAMS:

I don't think you have said it in

16

those terms, but I don't think that this Court has ever

17

abandoned the notion that legislative reports and whatever

18

legislative — other legislative history exists is not

19

something appropriate to look at and —

20
21

QUESTION:

When the statutory language is

ambiguous --

22

MR. ADAMS:

23

QUESTION:

I think in this case, Your Honor —
Do you think attorney's fees is

24

ambiguous, so that just reading that language it might

25

include expert witness fees?

would you say the language is ambiguous?

MR. ADAMS:

18

Certainly not, Your Honor.

If —
Absent any legislative history?
If there was no legislative -None.
— history.

It was just this

statute, I would probably not be sitting here today.

19

QUESTION:

So you say it would not be ambiguous?

If there were not this legislative

case and I lose.

2

MR. ADAMS:

If all you do is look to the four

3

corners of this statute, if you are not willing to ask the

4

additional question of what else was Congress trying to

5

do, yes, I think I do lose.

6

7

QUESTION:

Of course, you'd lose the paralegal

case, too, wouldn't you?

8

MR. ADAMS:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. ADAMS:

Yes.
Yeah.
And I think that's the significance

11

of this Court's beginning of its analysis in the Missouri

12

v. Jenkins case.

13

decision, it's apparent to me that this Court considered

14

and rejected the plain language argument that's being

15

advanced by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today.

16
17

QUESTION:

In fact, we rejected it 8 to 1,

didn't we?

18
19

Because in the very initial part of that

MR. ADAMS:

I believe it was 7 to 1.

I believe

that Justice Marshall —

20

QUESTION:

No, I think it's 8 to 1 on the

21

question whether any paralegals were allowed.

22

Chief Justice ruled and said, no fees at all for

23

paralegals.

I believe Justice Marshall took no part in that

1

decision.

I hope to get his vote today.

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

But I suppose there's quite a

4

difference between paralegals and expert witnesses.

5

Paralegals are in essence doing part of the attorney's

6

work, are they not?

7

MR. ADAMS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

They clearly are and so are —■
And expert witnesses are perhaps more

like independent contractors in a sense.

They're outside

a law office and the lawyer's work.
MR. ADAMS:

11

With respect, I would disagree.

I

12

think you are — I think with -- that you're trying to

13

draw a distinction based upon employment relationships and

14

I think Judge Posner's decision for the Seventh Circuit is

15

particularly good in explaining that if you really examine

16

that, that doesn't seem to be a very appropriate basis for

17

a distinction.

18

for a paralegal in order to make this fully complete

19

remedy, but you don't pay for the expert and yet the

20

expert probably provides a far more valuable service and

21

the attorney needs access to his services more than he

22

does his own paralegal.

23

You can have — you've got a -- you pay

QUESTION:

Well, then you disagree with Missouri

24

v. Jenkins, because that was the rationale of Justice

25

Brennan.

He said that attorney's fees include

secretaries, those that are integral to the operation of

2

the office.

3

that's all he means.

4

MR. ADAMS:

And it seems to me that, page 2470, that

With respect, I would disagree.

I

5

read -- I read that his decision as indicating that any

6

person whose labor has contributed to the work product of

7

the attorney ought to have —

8

QUESTION:

No, for which an attorney bills the

QUESTION:

— bills the client.

9

client.

10

Before the

11

attorney can bill his client for a successful prosecution

12

of a civil rights claim, he has got to work with that

13

expert.

14

unless he knows there is some reasonable expectation in a

15

meritorious civil rights case of being able to pay that

16

expert.

17

He cannot even seriously consider taking the case

QUESTION:

When you refer to civil rights cases,

18

uh, you obviously refer to your own case here where the

19

West Virginia University Hospital sued the State of

20

Pennsylvania or sued the Governor of Pennsylvania on a

21

statute where it claimed it had some entitlements.

22

So you're really not talking about civil rights

23

in any narrow sense.

24

who has a claim under Federal law.

25

MR. ADAMS:

You're talking about any plaintiff

As broadly as this Court has

construed that.

Your Honor, your -- this Court

3

In my particular situation, of course,

QUEST[0N:

And you aren't talking about somebody

4

who couldn't independently — wouldn't independently have

5

the money to pay the expert.

6

MR. ADAMS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ADAMS:

I think I am talking —■
Why?
— about the person, because if you

9

were to decide this case against my client, it would seem

10

to me that you have established a precedent, not just for

11

my client who had the fortune of having some kind of cash

12

flow, but you'd have also set a precedent for the

13

individual who did not have —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, that may be but your client has

the money to pay the expert.
MR. ADAMS:

Not true, Your Honor, and let me

17

explain why.

18

B48 in the petition's — appendix.

19

court discusses the testimony of Dr. James Vertrees, who

20

was the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's expert.

21

reason the district court was discussing that particular

22

testimony was that Dr. Vertrees had clearly testified that

23

the imposition of Pennsylvania's payment system on a

24

hospital such as my client had the potential, the real

25

potential of bankrupting a large university teaching

I would direct the Court's attention to page

And the

1

hospital.

2

program, because if you examine the legislative history to

3

the Social Security Act you will find that Congress had an

4

express concern for these large teaching hospitals that --

5

to put it bluntly -- are the dumping grounds of — for

6

poor patients.

7

And that's particularly serious in a Medicaid

And so my client as I said -- it had a cash

8

flow, but I would respectfully submit my client did not

9

have a deep pocket that was unending.

So, it's very

10

important if we're going to continue to deliver -- in my

Furthermore, we believe that that notion of a

because this Court has said that the work product doctrine

is an intensely practical doctrine grounded in the

realities of litigation, and experts are a reality of

MR. KOONS:

Very well, Mr. Adams.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We believe the starting point for the Court's

13

analysis in this case should begin with the Crawford

14

decision rather than the Missouri v. Jenkins opinion.

15

Crawford the court specifically said that the $30-a-day

16

limit for attendance fees for witnesses in Federal court

17

was fully applicable to expert witnesses and further said

18

that this limitation would be respected or had to be

19

respected by Federal courts unless there was some explicit

20

statutory authorization which would modify the limit.

21

In

The court went on to say that repeals by

22

implication were not favored and that it would not likely

23

infer that the limitations of the $30-a-day limit would be

24

repealed absent some statute or authority explicitly

25

referring to witness fees.

Quite simply, 1988 — section 1988 upon which

We think that it is certainly true that Congress

it chose was to award a reasonable attorney's fees and to

of the language that Congress used, which deserve

the limits that Congress set on taxable costs in 1920 and

Witnesses are in the business of giving testimony of

2

producing evidence, and we think that to apply the term

attorney's fee to witnesses would really be to distort it

4

beyond all recognition and deprive it of all meaning

5

whatsoever.

6

In conclusion, we think our construction fairly

7

gives effect to all three statutes as Congress wrote them,

8

is fully in accordance with Crawford and is not

9

inconsistent with Jenkins, and respects the fact that in

10

some statues Congress chose to shift both expert fees and

11

attorney's fees and in other statute it did not.

Mr. Koons, maybe you've said this

QUESTION:

20

MR. KOONS:

Is that attorney's fees?
Our position would be that it would

21

not be, because it is not work done by an attorney that

22

results in a legal work product, although, of course, the

23

Court would be free to resolve — reserve that issue for

24

another day --

I think not, Your Honor.

Under our

10

construction, it would not be work done by an attorney and

11

it wouldn't be — wouldn't be compensatory.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Koons, what do you make of

13

the language in Missouri v. Jenkins to the effect that the

14

terms reasonable attorney's fees must refer to a

15

reasonable fee for the work product of an attorney.

16

fee must take into account the work not only of attorneys

17

but also of secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors,

18

and others whose labor contributes to;the work product for

19

which an attorney bills her client.

The

20

MR. KOONS:

We interpret that phrase, Your

21

Honor, as referring to those people that are necessary in

22

the running of the attorney's office and who assist the

23

attorney in generating the work product.

disagree with Mr. Koons' statement that the witnesses in

With respect I would

That is not correct,

15

and I believe that the bills that we have supplied to you

in the appendix demonstrate that for 2 years, for 2 years

before we got to trial we were working hand in glove with

these experts in how to draft the pleading, and how to

shows that and that is not correct, because as a matter of

2

fact it was myself and my colleague, Mrs. Krebs, who

3

essentially located the experts for the hospital to see

4

whether or not there was a case to bring in view of the

5

hospital's belief that they were not getting paid the

6

right amount of money.

7

QUESTION:

And what about the billing?

Does the

8

record reflect that the billing went directly to the

9

client?

10

MR. ADAMS:

The record doesn't reflect, but I

11

will stipulate that the billing did go straight from the

12

experts to the client after it had been approved by me.

13

But I think the point that's so crucial,

14

particularly in modern civil rights litigation, is that

15

lawyers do not sit in their ivory tower by themselves.

16

They sit there next to their experts, and if you deny the

17

attorney access --

Your Honor, I stayed so far away

22

from the antitrust laws I would not even want to hazard a

23

guess on that.

I don't have an answer for you.

But you don't know what the answer is there?

QUESTION:

I really do not.
But -- you're arguing that, you know,

4

gee, you can't have an attorney without — without all

5

these experts.

6

every other kind of statute as well.

7

It would really apply across the board to

MR. ADAMS:

That's true, but you know there is

8

one unique distinction about 1988 in comparison to all

9

these other fee-shifting statutes that we have.

And that

10

is, to the best of my knowledge, 1988 is a statute which

11

addresses not only violations of Federal statutory law

12

that is the -- in place to address constitutional

13

violations.

14

by the district court of the equal protection clause.

15

I find it somewhat amazing that you could have a fee-

16

shifting statute that, granted, is part of a very

17

important national policy for the environment which covers

18

the experts, but when you get to the area of

constitutional violations, Congress was somehow inept and

didn't cover fees in that arena?

MR. ADAMS:

That may be true, but as a matter of

fact today if we are to give honor to this notion of work

product, this intensely practical doctrine, I think the

court ought to.
