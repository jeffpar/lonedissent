ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES,

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

13

This case involves a challenge to the

14

constitutional validity of the Board of Review created as

15

part of the administrative structure under which

16

Washington Dulles and Washington National Airports have

17

been leased by the Federal Government to an Airports

18

Authority created by joint action of Virginia and the

19

District of Columbia.

20

a novel one, arises from the fact that Congress made it a

21

condition of -the lease that the Airports Authority create

22

a Board of Review, that this Board of -Review have veto

23

power over certain significant actions of the Airport

24

Authority, and*that the Board of Review shall consist of

Members of Congress to be selected by the Airports

Authority from lists to be furnished by the Speaker of the

2

House and the President pro tem of the Senate.

The problem was addressed by the court of

4

appeals after holding that the controversy was

5

justiciable, and the court of appeals made essentially two

6

determinations.

8

had to be analyzed on that basis; and second, that when it

was analyzed on that basis, its existence, its authority,

We contend that the court of appeals was wrong

analysis, we contend that it was wrong in concluding that

15

for purposes of separation of powers analysis the Board of

joint action of the State of Virginia and the District of

7

Columbia in accordance with conditions laid down by

8

Federal law.

We think that

The Board of Review is not created by Federal

The Board of Review was created independently by the

9

But Virginia and the District of Columbia were

10

not coerced into creating that board any more than South

11

Dakota was coerced into raising the drinking age to 21 as

12

a condition of receiving Federal funds.

13

that the inducement, which admittedly did exist, was

14

probably a good deal less than in that case and than in

15

the case of Steward Machine Company against Davis.
QUESTION:

16

Indeed we believe

Mr. Shapiro, by the same logic I

17

suppose you would be — you're defending an effort by

18

Congress to structure some kind of board of review with

19

effective veto power, as this board has, over,‘for

20

instance, the Federal funding of aid to the States for

21

transportation or health services or welfare benefits, or

22

anything else that the Federal Government provides money

23

for.

24

means by which the Congress could in effect haive a veto

25

exercised by members of its appropriate committees.

I mean, that would be your theory, and it would be a

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, we believe that this

2

branch of the analysis doesn't solve the problem.

3

poses the question.

4

the board itself was not created by Congress leaves a

5

difficult constitutional analysis --

6

QUESTION:

It only

That is we think that the fact that

Well, Congress certainly had a gun

7

pointed at the heads of Virginia and the District of

8

Columbia, which wanted to establish an airport authority,

9

and Congress said fine, you can do it but you're going to

10

give us the veto in effect.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

But we believe, Your Honor, that

12

in terms of this Court's analysis and in terms of

13

practical realities it was an offer they could refuse.

14

That is it was not the kind of coercion that this Court

15

has said literally destroys the independence of the State

16

actor.

17

Now, as I said, we believe that that simply

18

poses the constitutional issue.

19

in our brief that the constitutional issue that is posed

20

by these conditions is a very difficult and serious one.

21

QUESTION:

We have tried to explain

Why does it just pose it, Mr.

22

Shapiro?

23

exercised here, isn't that an end of the separation of

24

powers problem?

25

If you say that there is no -Federal power being

1

possible conceptual approaches to this, Your Honor.

2

is the one you just suggested, that is taken I think

3

perhaps by the petitioner, to say if it's done by the

4

States and if they weren't coerced, that's the end of it.

5

The respondents take the opposite conceptual approach and

6

say if Congress has attached this condition, then Congress

7

is asserting itself in a way in which it is not allowed to

8

by the Constitution.

9

QUESTION:

One

Well, but there -- which is to say

10

that there is Federal power being exercised.

But you are

11

contending that there is no Federal power being exercised.

12

And if there is no Federal power being exercised, that's

13

the end of the thing, isn't it?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the Federal power takes the

15

form of a condition.

16

question whether the Federal power in the form of a

17

condition is an unconstitutional condition because of its

18

implications for the separation of powers.

QUESTION:

We see the question as being the

So you say there is Federal power

Oh.

By Congress, yes.

there was no Federal power being exercised.

saying that the Board of Review is exercising Federal

power in the actions that it takes, that the Board of

3

Review effectively is a Federal agency and has to be

4

analyzed as such.

5

that it would violate both the incompatibility --

If that were true, it seems to us clear

Well, I mean, nobody contests that

the statute that Congress passed is an exercise of Federal

power.

Is that all you're saying?

power to pass the statute.

QUESTION:

But it's not — that would be a valid

argument if they were using the condition in order,

3

unconstitutionally, to exercise Federal power.

But you're

So therefore

Congress passed a

Where is the unconstitutionality?

MR. SHAPIRO:

We — well, what we are concerned

11

about — first of all we believe that in this case what

12

exercise of Federal power there was did not violate the

13

Constitution.

14

in which Congress had reserved the authority to appoint

15

members of the board.

16

additional exercise of Federal power involved in the

17

appointment, or Congress had reserved the authority to

18

remove members of the board.

But change the case, for example, to a case

Then of course there would be the

19

Now, one of the arguments that is suggested by

20

the court of appeals, and that I think is adopted by the

21

respondents, is that there is in this case additional
O

22

exercise of Federal power in the form -of a kind of de

23

facto appointment and removal power existing in Congress.

24

For example, it is suggested that, by removing members of

25

1

committees, Congress can effectively remove them from

2

their position of authority in State office.

3

would be an additional exercise of Federal power.

4

QUESTION:

So that

Just to finish up your response to

5

Justice O'Connor, do I understand that the Government's

6

only problem, the executive branch's only problem with

7

this statute is a federalism problem, not a separation of

8

powers problem?

9

because it impinges on the States.

10

It's just the unconstitutional condition
Is that the only

problem the executive branch has with this?
MR. SHAPIRO:

11

No.

No, it is not, Your Honor.

12

We do, in addition, have a separation of powers problem.

13

We think that problem is answered in the context of this

14

case.

15

hypotheticals that Justice O'Connor raises in her

16

question, because we think that if Congress were to use

17

this condition device as a way of putting Members of

18

Congress into essentially executive roles in the playing

19

out of Federal programs at the State level, that that

20

would be a usurpation of executive authority and

21

interference with the executive role.

We don't think it can be answered in all of the

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Shapiro —

23

QUESTION:

Does the Government take a position

24

as to whether the Members of Congress who are appointed to

25

this -- these State, or State boards, or this board set up

1

by the States, whether their term on the board survives

2

their term on the committee in question?
MR. SHAPIRO:

3

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe that

4

the requirement that the members of the Board of Review be

5

both Members of Congress and in most cases members of

6

certain relevant committees do constitute solely

7

qualifications for appointment.

8

from the structure of the statute, that subsection 1

9

refers to appointment of 2456(f).

We think that is clear

Subsection 2 refers to

10

fixed terms of office, which in our view do not require

11

that, once appointed, those members of the board either

12

continue to be Members of Congress or continue to be

13

members of the relevant committees.

14

Incidentally, the only time, as I understand it,

15

that that has come up, when Senator Kassebaum did cease to

16

be a member of the relevant committee, she did resign from

17

the board.

18

not required.

19

But our view under the statute is that that's

QUESTION:

I suppose if you interpreted the

20

Constitution that way, a senator who has to be a citizen

21

to be elected, should he abandon his American citizenship

22

during his 6-year term, could continue to serve, because

23

it's only a qualification for taking the office and not

24

for continuing in it?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

I — I don't know whether the

O'Connor raised?

committees.

that is that, as you put it, there is a, appears to be a

There's still a problem to be answered, and

de facto exercise of Federal power over — in this case

11

over the actions of a non-Federal board of directors.

12

Congress is still de facto being allowed to exercise

13

power, isn't it?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

We don't think with respect to

15

16

Congress has either de jure or de facto removal power.

That is we don't think

No, but with respect to the authority

18

that they exercise in their approval or disapproval power

related question which we think is relevant to Justice

Yes, yes.

-- in relation to welfare money to

the States, highway money to the States, and so on.

What

is your answer to that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

11

Well, our answer to that is that

12

in the unusual circumstances of this case we don't think

13

the members of the Board of Review themselves are

14

exercising congressional power or acting as agents of

15

Congress.

16

substance we believe that the Members of Congress are

serving as individual representatives of users.

MR. SHAPIRO:

There is no question that the

legislative history confirms that.

But they also have interests that

are shared more broadly by all users, and indeed the

their need to use the airport as individuals.

also true that that is a need that is -- excuse me, Your

Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

"officers of the United States," end quote, or as review

board members do they exercise any Federal power pursuant

they are not exercising State power.
QUESTION:

10

The

The

Well, Mr. Coleman, isn't the reality,

11

though, that the members of the board are required to be

Members of Congress, or at least a certain number of them,

13

and they have to be members of a certain committee of

14

Congress?

15

they must be removed.

not an exercise of Federal power, on a continuing basis?

21

In the first place, your first question is

QUESTION:
*■

Um-hum.

MR. COLEMAN:

The speaker suggests the name.

22

It's up to the board of directors, the State agency, to

23

select.

24

there's the governmental, the Congress who suggests the

25

name, but if the appointing authority has the discretion

1

to select among that group, then you don't have violation

2

of article — the article II, section 2, clause 2.

3

therefore, even if those people are suggested by the

4

speaker, the fact that they are appointed by the board

5

takes away that problem.

6

QUESTION:

So

With respect —

Mr. Coleman, as I understand your

7

position, the phrase that these people shall act in their

8

personal capacity cleanses it all.

9

maintain that even if it were provided that this board

I think you would

would consist of both Houses of Congress, the Members of

11

both Houses of Congress acting in their personal capacity,

12

it would still be okay, wouldn't it?

15

MR. COLEMAN:
it a harder case.

Well, Your Honor, that would make

QUESTION:

It would make it a different case.

16

It wouldn't be harder for you, because they would still be

So that's a harder case.

But if

the determination is that they are selected by State

people and they are not exercising State power, then it

doesn't violate the Constitution.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATTI A. GOLDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Ms. Goldman,

MS. GOLDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

There is no dispute that Members of Congress

8

could not exercise the powers that are assigned to the

9

Board of Review if the Federal Government still ran the

10

airports.

11

have required the Airports Authority to submit its actions

12

to Congress for a specified period of time, or ever for

13

approval in the form of a statute.

14

whether Congress can make its delegation of authority over

15

the airports subject to a condition that requires nine

16

Members of Congress to exercise significant ongoing

17

authority over those airports.

18

There is also no dispute that Congress could

The question here is

Four factors of the Board of Review arrangement

19

bear directly on this issue.

20

arose out of a Federal condition that is contained in a

21

Federal statute and a lease of Federal property.

22

that condition requires nine Members of Congress to

23

comprise the Board of Review.

recommended by the congressional leadership, and eight of

25

them must serve on the congressional committees that have

Second,

2

oversight responsibilities over the airports.
The third factor is the powers exercised by the

3

Board of Review.

There is no question that the types of

4

powers that the board exercises are executive in nature.

5

And the fourth factor is the nonseverability clause, or

6

what we have called the drop-dead clause.

7

decided in the statute that if the Board of Review cannot

8

exercise its powers, neither can the Airports Authority.

9

And the significance of this factor is that Congress made

Congress has

10

that decision, not the District and not Virginia, and also

11

that Congress believed that the power its Members would

12

exercise was an essential element of the transfer.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Goldman, what if instead of the

14

transaction we have here Congress had simply said we're

15

going to give a year-to-year lease to the Metropolitan

16

Airports Authority, no Members of Congress on the review

17

board at all, but the review board totally independent

18

decides to abolish parking places for Members of Congress

19

and Justices of the Supreme Court.

review board over about a month before the first year of

Now, there

that, would there?

2

MS. GOLDMAN:

There would be not -- no official

ongoing role that Members of Congress play.

Congress still has the power, the retained congressional

power to pass statutes and to decide whether the lease

could go forward, but that's the kind of power Congress

can exercise.

the separation of powers violation.

QUESTION:

Of course if Congress wanted to renew

11

the lease, if Congress was content with the parking spaces

could veto the lease renewal in that situation, couldn't

required, then the President would have that power.
QUESTION:

It's quite a different process than

20

just having some individual Members of Congress or a

21

committee of Congress decide to do it or not.
.

22

MS. GOLDMAN:

(

It's a very di-fferent process, and

23

that's precisely what's wrong with this arrangement.

24

Members of Congress are carrying out day-to-day

25

operational responsibilities over these airports.

It's important to recognize too that Congress
did not give up the airports, and that it independentlyobtained this power.

It refused to give up the powers

that are exercised by the Board of Review.

In essence

this is an incomplete delegation of power.

Congress gave

up a large measure of the power, but not the power over
the master plan and the budget and regulations.

These

powers it kept for the Federal Government, and it assigned
these powers to nine of its own Members.

As retained

Federal powers, these powers cannot be exercised by
Congress in this way.
QUESTION:

You say assigned it to nine of their

Members, but it does provide that the Members are to act
in their individual capacity.
MS. GOLDMAN:

It does, but that label does not

change the fact that the board must consist of nine
Members, that they must be recommended by the
congressional leadership.
QUESTION:

What do you do about the Chief

Justice being on the board of the Smithsonian, being
chairman of the board of the Smithsonian, which goes back
quite a ways?

accused of laying a hand on the arc of the covenant, as
Justice Holmes said, and fortunately I don't think we have

MS. GOLDMAN:

They may not

They're artistic powers, is that --

I'm not familiar with the day-to-

7

day functions that the board would exercise, but it may be

8

that those powers are not as significant to be a Federal

9

office under the laws of the United States, so Members of

10

Congress may be able to exercise those functions.

11

though, the functions are clearly executive.

12

Congress could not exercise these functions in the Federal

13

scheme, and Members of Congress could not in their

individual capacity exercise a veto of the sort that was

struck down by this Court in Chadha.

Well, what distinction are we talking

about here then, between acting in one's individual

capacity and one's presumably official capacity?

7

MS. GOLDMAN:

Is that

Well, in the Federal scheme

8

Members of Congress only have one identity, and that is

9

their official role.

Because of the incompatibility

10

clause, Members cannot take off their congressional hat

11

and become individuals serving in some Federal kind of

12

position.

13

service is tied with the term of office, as we believe it

14

is here as well.

In the situation of the Smithsonian their

QUESTION:

So you would have no issue to raise

16

by the mere fact that some Members of Congress happen to

end up on this board if it were not for the fact that

QUESTION:

And their congressional membership is

merely incidental.

is merely incidental.

7

And you're saying the fact of the

MS. GOLDMAN:

It is both the qualification, the

8

requirement that they be Members of Congress, and also

9

that that requirement came at least in part from Congress.

10

So that in this situation we have congressional

11

aggrandizement, where Congress, by passing a statute that

12

establishes this condition, has required that its own

13

members get power over Federal property.

14

QUESTION:

And why isn't the same — why doesn't

15

the same problem exist for the congressional members of

16

It may not because the powers they

MS. GOLDMAN:

It might do more than that by

really created by Federal law?
MS. GOLDMAN:

It is mandated by a condition.

If

the State of, Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of

Columbia wanted these airports, they had no choice but to

have a board of review.

created the Airports Authority, but it was the Federal

used that power to give its own Members a veto.

QUESTION:

So Congress had

Do you think if there were a 1983

14

suit against members of the board that it would be an

15

appropriate defense that they are Federal officers?

16

MS. GOLDMAN:

In this situation, because

17

Congress retains significant Federal powers, I think they

18

are Federal officers.

19

Federal conditions that would not create Ffederal offices.

20

And even if this is not viewed to be a Federal office it

21

would be impermissible, ^because it is giving Members of

Congress powers over Federal property'that it cannot have.

QUESTION:

Ms. Goldman, do you think this

MS. GOLDMAN:

This case concerns the Federal

separation of powers.
QUESTION:

We're not talking about federalism

then in the sense of South Dakota against Dole?
MS. GOLDMAN:

I don't think we are, because in

20

the kind of condition that was at issue in that case there

21

was a question of who had the power.

22

the power to legislate and the States -did.

23

the rationale is that when the States exercise their

24

power, their political process cleanses the Federal role.

Because of that, a condition is not the right

QUESTION:

So you see there would be no problem

if Congress said that every State university which

obtained Federal funds should have a board of regents,

five, six of whom are appointed by the President of the

United States?

I think there would be a problem

What would be the problem?
-- that the Federal Government is

usurping State power in that instance.
QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that same problem

present here?
MS. GOLDMAN:

Here ther#e is a stronger Federal

interest at the outset because of the presence of Federal

property in this arrangement.

QUESTION:

Well, I assume the President would

say the, and the Congress the same thing with expenditure

of Federal funds at State universities.

7

MS. GOLDMAN:

If Congress set up a review board

8

that had power over the Federal monies, the connection to

9

the Federal interest may be strong enough for the Federal

10

doctrine of separation of powers to be called into play.

11

But where the power is the power to run a State

12

university, which is State power at the outset and does

13

not change by the Federal condition, the Federal

14

appointment of individuals would probably usurp State

15

power.

16

QUESTION:

But isn't the justification in each

case the fact that there is Federal property in the form

of Federal money going, and that these are conditions

placed upon the Federal money.

stand on the same footing?

21

MS.. GOLDMAN:

Don't they ultimately all

I don't think they necessarily do,

it is going too far, and that is Federal power that cannot
