ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KELLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The petitioners asked this Court to restore

12

rationality to what Judge Posner termed the bizarre the

13

schedule of punishments in LSD cases that no one is able

14

to justify.

the blotter paper and the LSD was about 5.7 grams.

3

Government stipulated that the actual weight of the LSD

4

apart from the blotter paper was less than 1 gram.

fact, it was about 50 milligrams or less than 1 percent of

the combined weight of the LSD and the blotter paper.

QUESTION:

12

MR. KELLY:

13

QUESTION:

28 grams in an ounce.
Uh-huh.
Well, when the LSD is put on the

14

paper, does it remain a microdot or does it -- it spread

15

to the boundaries of the paper if the paper is big enough,

16

and how big is the paper?

17

MR. KELLY:

There are actually two different

18

ways of placing LSD on blotter paper.

19

LSD with a solution of alcohol and spray it across the

20

paper.

21

center of a square of blotter paper with a pipette.

22

Blotter paper generally comes in sheets that are about 10

23

inches square and they're perforated into 100 squares.

24

Each square would represent one dose of LSD.

25

One is to mix the

The other way is to place a dot of LSD onto the

QUESTION:

5

MR. KELLY:

6

QUESTION:

A square is about 1-inch square.
About an inch square.
Yes, Justice Kennedy.
I have one other technical question.
Sure.
When LSD is transported to this

person who is going to put it on the blotter paper, I take

8

it it's not pure, is it?

9

that's commonly distributed or is it cut when it's

10

delivered to the dealer?
MR. KELLY:

11
12

Do you have a pure vial of LSD

It's not cut in the sense that

cocaine, for instance, is cut by mixing it with mannitol.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KELLY:

Perhaps I should have said mixed.
Generally if LSD is being

15

distributed in liquid form in a vial, Justice Kennedy, it

16

would be done in a fairly high point in the distribution

17

chain.

18

it will be distributed on blotter paper or on another

19

carrier such as a sugar cube or gelatin capsules.

20

are the carriers most commonly used.

21

If it's being distributed to the average consumer,

QUESTION:

Those

Well, as it goes to the person who's

22

going to put it on the blotter paper, what kind of

23

container is it in and is it mixed with anything else?

MR. KELLY:
something like a vial.

It's probably going to be in

else, it would only be, again, if it had been in a

2

solution of alcohol to facilitate spraying it.
QUESTION:

Before you end with the so-called

4

technical questions, I didn't understand your response to

5

Justice Kennedy to explain what happens when the substance

6

hits the blotter paper.

7

of the blotter paper?

*

Does it penetrate into the fibers

8

MR. KELLY:

9

It, in essence, soaks through.
QUESTION:

10
11

It does penetrate into the fibers.

So, in a sense, one could say it is

mixed with the fibers of the blotter paper?
MR. KELLY:

12

It depends, Justice O'Connor, in

13

what sense one is using the term mixture as to whether

14

that would constitute a mixture.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

If one --

Well, in some sense one could say

that.
MR. KELLY:

In some sense one could say that.

18

It fair to say that the word can be interpreted broadly

19

enough to include that.

20

response to Justice Kennedy's question -- indicate that

21

when we're talking about the 1-inch square blotter paper,

22

I'm talking about what's probably an average size and that

ranged in weight from 5.5 micro -- or milligrams to 15.4

2

milligrams.
QUESTION:

3

I still didn't understand that one

4

half of your answer -- one that's — when is a dot is put

5

on a square, does the dot expand to the full area of the

6

square?
MR. KELLY:

7
8

No, it will probably expand

somewhat, but it won't cover the entire square.
QUESTION:

9

But it doesn't cover the entire

10

square, so the square would be partly just blotter paper

11

and then it would get increasingly concentrated as it gets

12

to the middle.

13

MR. KELLY:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
But if it's sprayed on, it extends to

15

the full extent of the square?

16

MR. KELLY:

17

That's correct, because generally

it's going to sprayed across the entire sheet.
QUESTION:

18

It doesn't really matter whether it's

19

a mixture.

20

statute and the sentencing guidelines both say it has to

21

be either a mixture or a substance containing a detectable

22

amount of heroin.

23

either a mixture or a substance.

24

blotter is a substance, isn't it?

25

I mean, when it penetrates the fiber, the

And it seems to me the blotter is

Certainly there is a sense in which

1

blotter paper is a substance, as is any material thing.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. KELLY:

Yes.
Interestingly the majority in the

4

case below suggested that blotter paper is probably not a

5

substance in that sense and found that it was a mixture.

6

The courts of appeals have been divided as to whether it's

7

a mixture or whether it's a substance.

8
9

I don't think that it's a substance in the sense
that Congress intended that term.

Because if the term if

10

read that broadly, then anything that carries the LSD

11

could viewed as a substance.

12

whether that's■blotter paper or a syringe or a Boeing 747,

13

a suitcase -- sure, one can think of all kinds of example.

14

I don't think that that's the sense of substance in which

15

Congress intended the word to be used.

16

And whether that's a vial or

I think what Congress was getting at when it

17

used the phrase, mixture or substance, are those things

18

which multiply the value of the drug by weight which

19

multiply the amount of the product which can ultimately

20

distribute -- be distributed to the ultimate consumer.

21

And that's the sense in which it's used when we're talking

22

about a cutting agent.

23

for instance, one creates a larger amount of product which

24

can be distributed to the ultimate consumer.

25

If one mixes cocaine with mannitol

Congress wanted to impose more severe punishments upon

distributors who are causing greater social harm by

multiplying the amount of the product that's available for

The saliva in his mouth will

matter how strong it is.

12

MR. KELLY:

Is that so?

LSD is distributed in relatively

13

standardized doses that tend to be, as I indicated, about

14

50 millionths of a gram.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KELLY:

17

A —

It is or it must be?
It is.

I don't think that there's

any reason other than practical reasons that it must be.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but unless it must be, then I

19

am correct that the more blotter paper you use, the more

20

distribution you can make, just as the more -- whatever

21

you mix cocaine with — you use the more distribution you

22

can make.

23

MR. KELLY:

Well, the -- it's correct, Justice

24

Scalia, that if you have more LSD, you need more blotter

paper in order to distribute it to the market.

a choice of a range of -- we might call doses.

I guess the difference is that if a

more than one dose of LSD, because taking additional doses

3

isn't going to give any particular additional benefit to

that user.

A user of LSD generally is not going to take

QUESTION:

Well, some people would say taking

the first dose didn't give him much benefit.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. KELLY:

9
10

I would certainly agree with that,

Chief — Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Isn't -- I guess I have two questions

11

about your argument.

12

on the blotter paper, it bears the same relationship to

13

the blotter paper that the cocaine does to the cutting

14

agent, doesn't it?

15

least without sophisticated chemical reductions to

16

distinguish between the drug and the substance that it is

17

associated with, whereas when you're dealing with bottles

18

or suitcases or automobiles, that is not true.

19

that respect, the analogy between the blotter paper and

20

the cutting agent for cocaine is in fact a legitimate

21

analogy, isn't it?

22

MR. KELLY:

The first is, when the LSD is placed

Because it's no longer possible at

So that in

It's not in the sense that the

23

purpose of the cutting agent or the diluent is to multiply

24

the amount of the drug that's available for sale.

25

QUESTION:

Well, that -- I guess that gets to

1

the second question I wanted to ask, and it's something

2

that you came close to in responding to one of Justice

3

Scalia's questions.

4

that without the combination of the LSD and the blotter

5

paper or the sugar cube — whatever it may be -- as a

6

practical matter you could not distribute the LSD in

7

commercial or at least in — in consumable form, because

8

as I understand it, the amount of LSD that is necessary,

9

and indeed I guess even possible for the effect that the

10

users want to get out of it, is so tiny that if you sold

11

them tubes or jars of LSD, they simply could not use the

12

LSD in that form.

It is the — it is true, isn't it,

So that if you've got tubes and jars of it,

13
14

you've got something which in that form simply cannot be

15

commercially used.

16

use it is to combine it with blotter paper or sugar cubes.

17

And in that sense, by making that combination, you do make

18

it more broadly distributable than it would be without the

19

combination.

20

on when the cocaine is cut with whatever it's combined

21

with.

And the only way you can commercially

And that is exactly the same thing that goes

Isn't that true?

22

MR. KELLY:

It's true that as a practical

23

matter, it's generally necessary to have some sort of a

24

carrier in order to deliver the LSD conveniently to a

25

consumer.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you — as a practical matter

2

you couldn't sell it on the street without doing that,

3

could you?

4

MR. KELLY:

Well, there have been cases and

5

there's one cited in my reply brief in which an individual

6

ingested liquid LSD directly into his eyeball, apparently

7

from a pipette or a — something akin to an eye dropper,

8

but that's not —

9

QUESTION:

But if that were the only way you

10

could sell LSD, the market for LSD would — would be

11

considerably less, wouldn't it?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. KELLY:

14

It would probably diminish greatly,

Your Honor, yes.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KELLY:

Okay.
I think my point is that it's

17

certainly a — probably a unique property of LSD that it

18

is so infinitesimal in size that it requires a carrier.

19

But I don't think that Congress intended to weigh the

20

carrier simply because of the fact that a carrier is

21

needed to carry this drug.

24

bindle, an envelop.

It's — nobody carries cocaine

Well, no -- no one is saying here

✓

1

that if you put the blotter paper in a paper bindle or an

2

envelop that you're going to weigh the envelop.

3

that's the analogy to the — to the cocaine, isn't it?

4

MR. KELLY:

I think the more apt analogy,

5

Justice Souter, is that if you took a piece of blotter

6

paper and folded it into a bindle and used it to carry

7

cocaine, nobody would weigh the blotter paper.

8

used the same piece of blotter paper to carry LSD, courts

9

are weighing it.

10

'

But if you

It's no less —

QUESTION:

For the -- for the simple reason that

11

you can easily distinguish in your analogy — in your

12

example you can easily distinguish between the cocaine and

13

the blotter paper.

14

between the LSD and the blotter paper.

15

token, the blotter paper is used as a means of ingestion

16

in the LSD case.

17

in your example.

18

And you can't easily distinguish
And by the same

It is not used as a means of ingestion

MR. KELLY:

I don't think that Congress had in

19

mind, Justice Souter, that the ingestability was the

20

factor that would count something as a mixture or

21

substance.

22

of section 841 that what Congress wanted to do was visit

23

more severe sentences upon high-volume dealers.

24

ingestability of the carrier has nothing to do with the

25

volume of the LSD that can be distributed.

QUESTION:

But -- but there is a correlation

between the means used to prepare something for ingestion

and the breadth of its potential distribution.

is what Congress was getting at.

just as true in the LSD in relation to the blotter paper

6

as it is of the cocaine in relation to whatever substance

7

it is mixed with.

8
9

MR. KELLY:

And that

And that seems to me

Again, the fact that LSD requires a

carrier, Justice Souter, does not to me to suggest that

10

Congress intended to weigh that carrier when Congress

11

isn't weighing any other kinds of drug carriers.

Once we start weighing the carriers, we see the
absurd results that I've discussed in our briefs.
QUESTION:

How do you -- are you using the term

carrier as a word of art?
MR. KELLY:

I'm using carrier as a generic term

for something that transports a drug.
QUESTION:

Some -- something that -- a suitcase

would likewise be a carrier?
MR. KELLY:

I would say a suitcase would be a

carrier, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, this is a fairly unique carrier

it, isn't it?

I think that the term can be read

So that would distinguish this

carrier at any rate from carriers which are, you know,

that, where there — where there isn't any combination.
MR. KELLY:

10

I think that's a distinguishing

11

feature, but again I don't see that as a feature that

12

would motivate Congress to want to weigh that carrier.

13

don't know why Congress would want somebody to receive a

sentence that's almost 20 times longer if he uses a sugar

I take it then you suggest that we

MR. KELLY:

Correct.

That's --

So you're -- you -- you're saying

that for purposes of the statute that — there cannot be a

a way as to dilute the drug itself more or less.

QUESTION:

But your argument rests then I think

21

on the assumption that there cannot be a mixture within

congressional purpose unless the mixture gives a means of

the real characteristic of mixture, then you've got a

2

mixture when you combine the LSD with the blotter paper in

the same way that you have a mixture when you combine the

cocaine with its cutting agent.

5

MR. KELLY:

6

section 841(b) is not a statute that prohibits the use of

7

blotter paper.

8

code that prohibits the use of any drug paraphernalia that

9

certainly encompasses blotter paper.

There is a separate statute in the Federal

841(b) is a punishment statute.

10

y

I think we have to keep in mind that

841(a)

11

prohibits the distribution of LSD in any form.

12

construing a punishment statute and a punishment statute

13

that's based on weight, I think we have to wonder whether

14

Congress thought that there was some relationship between

15

the weight of blotter paper and the sentence that should

16

be imposed.

17

contemplated such a relationship, because there isn't one.

18

The dealer who is selling LSD on a heavy blotter paper is

19

certainly no more culpable than the dealer who is selling

20

LSD on a lighter blotter paper.

So in

It's an entirely different argument to say —

2

and I realize that you — that you're going to get onto

3

this -- it's a very different argument to say that the

4

various means of mixtures of LSD raise egual protection or

5

due process problems.

6

to me the question for the statutory interpretation, which

7

is whether there's a mixture there at all.
MR. KELLY:

8

9

But that's — that's not it seems

I think, Justice Souter, that in

order to interpret the statute, one has to divine what

10

Congress meant by the term mixture or substance.

11

has to ask whether Congress would have intended these

12

dramatically varying results based on something that has

13

absolutely nothing to do with culpability.

And one

Certainly that has implications for the due
process and equal protection argument as well.

2

Now, there is no doubt that adding different

3

cutting agents — carrier mediums, if you will — will

4

increase the exposure a person has under the statute, and

5

that's because Congress clearly picked a weight-based

approach.

7

But the percentage —
QUESTION:

Well, that would be true for cocaine

I mean, if it -- if as

you increase the cutting agent and decrease the strength

10

of the pure cocaine, you're increasing the range of

12

MR. LARKIN:

Precisely.

And the figures in the

13

case of LSD don't differ by several orders of magnitude

14

from the figures that you can see in the case of heroin.

15

For example, in this case the LSD that was distributed by

16

Chapman had a percentage value of .877.

17

by Marshall was .59.

18

that's not off by degrees of magnitude from the type of

19

heroin you can see on the street.

21

identified the percentage amount of heroin in some of the

22

drugs that were seized.

23

25

That distributed

That's less than 1 percent.

In Baltimore, for example, 3.1 percent was the

Plus some of the studies that were cited in the — in the

So the dilution factor that you see in the case

MR. KELLY:

21

It's our position that basing sentences in LSD

sensible as deciding this case on the weight of the

briefs.

25

that weight and the culpability of the offender.

There's simply no rational relationship between

And that can't be what Congress meant.

It's convenient.

I mean, if you pass

amount of alcohol is vastly different?

There's no reason Congress would want to

It's convenient.

No, in those cases, you certainly

don't.

And Judge Posner pointed that out in his dissent.

14

Buy the difference between that situation and this

situation is that it's not just a question of convenience.

It's a question of rationality.

he's selling it on a — on a heavier paper and getting a

And there's no rational

And the

Government has yet to do that.
I think that's why this Court is going to have
to find, first, that that can't be what Congress intended
by the phrase "mixture or substance."

And secondly, that

if that's what Congress intended, the law has to be struck
down, because it violates the right to equal protection of
the law.

It's drawing distinctions between identically

situated offenders.

And that distinction that it's

drawing isn't based on a rational reason.
The Government's theory in this case just
doesn't make any sense.

The law as interpreted by the

Government just doesn't make any sense.

For that reason,

we ask this Court to reverse the convictions of these
defendants — reverse the judgments of the court of
