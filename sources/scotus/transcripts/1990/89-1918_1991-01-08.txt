CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. di Trapano, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH L. di TRAPANO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. di TRAPANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The essential issue on this appeal is under what

12

circumstances and to what extent can a noncoercive

13

solicitation of campaign contributions to defray an

14

election expense be in violation of the color of official

15

right provision of the Hobbs Act, and also to what extent

16

and under what circumstances would income declared or the

17

failure to declare a campaign contribution as income

18

violate the tax fraud statutes.

19

The petitioner in this case was a legislator in

20

the House of Delegates in West Virginia with a history of

21

having sponsored and having worked very hard for a

22

hospital in Southern West Virginia that had to be staffed

23

by foreign-trained doctors, in this case Filipino doctors.

24

For a period of years the activities of this legislator

25

was limited to extending a temporary license.

Without

1

that extension, without legislative enactment, this

2

hospital would not be able to have operated, and those

3

people in need of health care in that region of Appalachia

4

would have had to travel some 2-1/2 hours to Charleston.

5

This was a very crucial need in that area, and this — and

6

the petitioner involved was heavily involved with that

7

objective.

8

QUESTION:

Where exactly was his district?

9

MR. di TRAPANO:

The district is the — it's the

10

southern district of West Virginia; Logan County is the

11

county that he is elected from, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Logan County.

13

MR. di TRAPANO:

A couple of days before the

14

June 1 payment, the contribution was made, there was a

15

phone call — and this is the only evidence, the only

16

evidence that links the petitioner with a solicitation.

17

phone call made by the lobbyist where the conversation had

18

to do with the campaign.

20

what are you going to do about it.

The petitioner said I have an

Now, the court — rather the United States

10

Attorney's Office indicted — had Mr. McCormick indicted

11

under color of official right.

12

thesis that color of official right, a plain reading, the

13

plain meaning of color of official right is a pretended

14

assertion of right, that the Congress of 1946 never

15

contemplated that color of official right would be used to

16

prosecute election laws and enforce election laws of the

17

state.

18

in 1943 — the law was enacted in 1946 but Congressman

19

Hobbs from Alabama, when questioned about color of

20

official right and what it meant, the debate is very

21

limited, and he said it means a pretense assertion of

22

right.

23

is asserting the right, more rights than he does have, in

24

extracting money.

It is the — it is our

never prosecuted for campaign violations until the 1970's.

That particular passage went unobserved and was not used

3

as a vehicle to prosecute defendants for violating State

election laws.

In the Government's brief the Government -

6

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. di Trapano.

As I

7

understand it, the Government's theory for not using it,

8

however, is quite different from the one that you have

9

said.

10
11

MR. di TRAPANO:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

Right?

That was what they

That it was not an independent clause, color of

17

MR. di TRAPANO:

No, Your Honor.

The

18

Government's theory in the case, as I understand it, is

19

that they contended that this payment was not a political

20

contribution at all.

22

QUESTION:
this case.

No, no, no.

I'm talking about those years --

In those years, yes.

— in which, as you have just

described, the Government never used this provision -6

MR. di TRAPANO:

2

QUESTION:

Never used it, right.

— for things of this sort, political

3

corruption.

4

not the legislative history that you have just described.

5

Their reason for not using it was not, as I understand it,

6

that they thought you had — in order to come within it

7

you had to assert a right to it that you really didn't

8

possess.

9

Their reason for not using it was not, was

MR. di TRAPANO:

That's — that appears to be

10

the Government's reasoning, but it's not — it's not

11

justified by the, by the language of the act.
QUESTION:

12

Well, my understanding is that that

13

was not the Government's reason.

14

reason for not using it was that they thought it was not

15

an independent clause at all, but that that whole clause,

16

"or under color of official right," was attached to the

17

other clauses, and you had to show the other ones in

18

addition to that one.

19

MR. di TRAPANO:

QUESTION:

21

MR. di TRAPANO:

That the Government's

That's correct.

Okay.
That was used — for the first

22

time in the 1970's used, and disjunctive in the Kenny

23

case.

24
25

That is correct, Your Honor.
In any event, the Government chose to call this

transaction a personal payoff.

Now, the contribution was

admittedly made in contravention to State law, because the

2

state law in West Virginia makes cash contributions in

3

excess of $50 illegal, and it is punishable, as I have

4

said, by three times the fine.

It also went unreported.

5

Now, we feel that the — that the color --

QUESTION:

It went unreported because the

MR. di TRAPANO:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, the

petitioner didn't report it.

10

QUESTION:

Not only didn't report it for State

11

law purposes as campaign contribution, but didn't report

12

it as Federal income.

13

MR. di TRAPANO:

Yes.

But the petitioner -- but

14

there is no evidence that the petitioner had not used this

15

to reimburse himself for advance that he had made to his

16

campaign.

17

that that was the campaign —

18

QUESTION:

And the evidence, and the Government concedes

Well, I suppose those facts are

19

evidence about — that go to whether it was a campaign

20

contribution or not.

21

in compliance with the laws for receiving campaign

22

contributions, I suppose the jury can consider that fact.

23

If it isn't treated by the candidate

MR. di TRAPANO:

Well, the jury apparently did

24

consider that, but we, we strongly urged the court not to

25

instruct the jury because under the color of official

conversation that had to do with the transaction, it was

described as helping Bob in the election, helping him in

his campaign.

There was nothing in any of the

11

conversations that had to do that this was some kind of a

12

personal payoff.

13

Now, the, the petitioner — the court in its —

QUESTION:

How do you explain the failure to

15

report it as a campaign contribution and the failure to

16

report it as income?

17

MR. di TRAPANO:

QUESTION:

19

MR. di TRAPANO:

How do I --

Explain it.
Well, the campaign — money

20

received to defray expenses is not income.

21

not income, it shouldn't be reported.

3

With respect to the — to the application of the
Hobbs Act, the color of official right —
QUESTION:

Mr. di Trapano, I think Justice

4

O'Connor also asked how do you explain the failure to

5

report it under West Virginia law?

6

MR. di TRAPANO:

I don't — I don't have an

7

explanation why he didn't report it, other than he simply

8

didn't comply with the West Virginia reporting laws.

9

There may be — there may have been other contributions

10

not reported.

11

of the, of the, to the jury — the court in charge of the

12

jury in connection with these contributions said that it

13

was — that if the contribution, and specifically the

14

contribution from the doctors to the petitioner, if it was

15

not voluntarily made.

16

having an expectation of benefit, whatever benediction the

17

defendant received as a result of that instruction was

18

stripped away by the court's conditioning every voluntary

19

contribution unless it was made — it was not voluntary if

20

there was some expectation of benefit.

21

obviously, the doctors did have an expectation of benefit,

22

as virtually every political contribution carries.

23

But our strenuous objection to the charge

And voluntary was described as not

instructions.

2

court said that if, that a political contribution, even if

3

not reported and even if it was in cash, in violation of

4

state law, can still be a political contribution if

5

voluntarily made.

6

that by saying that it's not a voluntary contribution if

there is some expectation of benefit.

But then again destroyed the effect of

Going back to the Hobbs Act and the Enmons case,

14

and the Hobbs Act as interpreted of this Court, if the —

15

if it had — if there is a legitimate entitlement to the

16

contribution — there was in this case — then the means,

17

whether it was not reported, whether it was in

MR. di TRAPANO:

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you think that it would be a

will give me a so-called — a campaign contribution, then

I promise I will try to help you get the legislation you

want?
MR. di TRAPANO:

If the color of official right

I'd say yes.

understand the decisions in that context.

But where you

2

have a candidate for public office whose very — whose

3

very life depends upon raising campaign contributions,

4

then the laws, the standards should be different.

5

We were prejudiced by the instructions.

The

trial court said if the payment focused on the office.

Now, that has no business in this kind of a case, because

every contribution focuses on the office.

QUESTION:

And the jury

May I just ask you this question?

it essential to your position that we conclude that this

was a campaign contribution?

13

question is, as I read the instructions, the judge told

the jury that there was nothing illegal about making a

from the verdict of guilty that the jury therefore

determined that it was not a campaign contribution?

There is no basis for that as defining a

QUESTION:

And, Your Honor, that destroyed

I'm not sure I completely understand

10

your answer.

It seemed to me the judge did say it's not

12

13

MR. di TRAPANO:

QUESTION:

of mind of the donor, the payer; should not be the guiding

principle in determining the legal liability of the

4

recipient.

5

QUESTION:

You're referring — I'm sorry.

6

You're referring to page 34 of the Joint Appendix, I take

7

it, in which the instruction says in order to find Mr.

8

McCormick guilty you must be convinced beyond a reasonable

9

doubt that the payment alleged was made with the

10

expectation that such payment would influence Mr.

11

McCormick's official conduct and with knowledge on his

12

part that it was made, that the payment was made, with

13

that expectation?

different from a quid pro quo?

QUESTION:

1

O'Connor's questions by saying that a promise merely to

2

use best efforts to help in the passage of legislation

3

would not be a sufficient quid pro quo.

4

Was that your answer?
MR. di TRAPANO:

It says

it's okay if you give the money even in the hope that the

As originally given, the Government objected

to the wortl "voluntary" because in context it seemed to

that it would be a defense, and hence it would be

rely on a line that says there has to be a quid pro quo.

Your argument suggests that there is

QUESTION:

That's right, but they would have

Their argument has always been — well, of course,

I don't see that this, that the jury's

conviction on the later count necessarily shows that they
came to any conclusion on campaign contributions, other
than the kind of conclusion that would have been affected
by the campaign contribution instructions, which didn't
require a quid pro quo to invalidate it.
MR. WRIGHT:

I'm not sure I followed all that.

I would agree that there are two different kinds of
instructions here.

One is a conversion instruction and

one is if these were used for campaign expenses or to
reimburse the candidate, then they are not taxable in any

there can very well be a quid pro quo if he simply says

that is quite a plausible requirement to put into this

We —

vigorously objected to the court defining or instructing

10

the jury with respect to what a voluntary payment, that it

12

a campaign contribution.

objected to it.

14

did not let us read the charge he was going to give the

15

jury.

16

going to do — for example, we didn't — specific intent

17

was just — was charged to the jury without our having any

18

prior knowledge of what the instruction was going to be.

19

But we did object to the instruction.

We debated that, vigorously

We fought over — see, our trial judge

We have to — after the charge, he says what he's

We

20

offered instructions that made quid pro quo an essential -

21

- and quid pro quo has to be conditional.

22

our — that was our argument.

Honor, and we objected vigorous to it, and devoted a third

arguing over the instructions that were given to the jury.

We objected vigorously to them, to the instruction.

one instruction was where the court said every payment —

4

any payment made, in focusing on the official office is

5

illegal and comes within the purview of the color of

6

official right provision.

But moreover, see, the Government charged — the

8

Government argued to the jury, he says we don't have to

9

show that he gave some quid pro quo or threatened any

10

action.

with an expectation of benefit.

14

official right.

15

their instructions, that's what they argued to the jury,

16

and the defendant was prejudiced by those instructions.

17

Simply that when it was paid the doctors paid it
That's what they argued

Whether it's a campaign contribution makes no

That's what the Government argued in

The court, moreover, as Justice Scalia was

18

questioning about the tax fraud case, again voluntary was

19

— on four occasions that definition was given to the jury

20

that voluntary is that which is given without expectation

21

of benefit.

22

with that definition, then he was — then he was guilty of

23

the tax fraud case.
