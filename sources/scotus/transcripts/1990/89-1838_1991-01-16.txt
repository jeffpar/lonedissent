ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

This case brings before the Court a single

13

question of statutory interpretation:

14

of the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to acts of

15

discrimination by U.S. employers with respect to U.S.

16

citizens outside the territorial limits of the United

17

States.

18

held that Title VII does not apply abroad, relying on the

19

well-established presumption that acts of Congress

20

ordinarily do not apply outside the territorial limits of

21

the United States, absent an expression of intent to the

22

contrary.

23

whether Title VII

In this case the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc,

The court concluded that there was inadequate

24

evidence of Congress' intent so as to overcome the

25

presumption.

As a result the Fifth Circuit affirmed the

1

district court's dismissal of the lawsuit filed in this

2

case by the private petitioner, Ali Boureslan.

3

Mr. Boureslan is a naturalized U.S. citizen who

4

alleges in his complaint that during the course of his

5

employment in Saudi Arabia by ARAMCO, a U.S. corporation,

6

that he was the victim of discrimination based on race,

7

religion, and national origin.

8

9

In our view, Title VII's protections do not stop
at the border.

To the contrary, Congress intended for

10

Title VII's protections to run to the benefit of U.S.

11

citizens wherever they may be when they are in the employ

12

of U.S. employers.

13

in both the text and the structure of the statute itself.

14

Its intent, we believe, is reflected

In light of its broad grant of coverage set

15

forth in the opening section of Title VII, 2000e, Congress

16

then in the next provision, section 702.2000e-l carved out

17

two exceptions to Title VII's sweep, specifically, an

18

addition to the exception with respect to religious

19

institutions.

20

expressly exempts from Title VII the employment of, the

21

words of the statute, aliens outside any State.

22

Congress created the alien exemption which

The most natural reading of this provision, we

23

believe, is that the statutory protections of Title VII do

24

apply outside the United States, but that the statute's

25

coverage is limited by category.

That is, by excluding

1

one category, aliens, from coverage, the most natural and

2

reasonable inference to draw is that U.S. citizens are

3

protected.

4

And that reading is fully supported —
QUESTION:

General Starr, that's the most — you

5

assert that's the most reasonable reading.

6

it's the only reading?

7

understand it to apply just in the situation of United

8

States territories, so you'd be outside the States, but

9

still not in a foreign country?

10

MR. STARR:

Do you think

Is it textually not possible to

I think that is an exceptionally

11

strained reading of it.

There is no basis whatever in the

12

text of this statute to believe that that is what Congress

13

was getting at, and indeed, the legislative history — and

14

the only legislative history with respect to this specific

15

exemption at the time of the drafting in 1963 and 1964 —

16

is in support of our reading of it.

17

report says that the purpose of this was not with respect

18

to territories to solve the Vermilya-Brown problem that

19

the respondents have suggested, but rather it was — the

20

purpose was to remove, these are the words of the report,

21

conflicts of law, conflicts of law which might otherwise

22

exist between the United States and a foreign nation in

23

the employment of aliens outside the United States by an

24

American enterprise.

25

very similar explanation.

And the Senate reports contains a

QUESTION:

1

General Starr, let's grant that that

2

is a strained reading.

3

reading of a statute that confers jurisdiction over all

4

companies involved in interstate or foreign commerce of

5

the United States.

6

read that as applying only to United States companies or

7

companies involved in interstate or foreign commerce on

8

the shores of this country, as opposed to in France or

9

Germany.

10

I suppose it's also a strained

It is probably a strained reading to

That's a strained reading, too, but we do it all

the time, don't we?
MR. STARR:

11

I don't think it's strained at all,

12

because for one thing, we have guidance from what Congress

13

was getting at, especially in the history of this

14

provision, that it was getting at discrimination by U.S.

15

employers.

That has been the interpretation of the EEOC

16
17

QUESTION:

I'm not saying this provision is

18

strained.

19

it's strained.

20

when Congress — when Congress means to apply the laws of

21

the United States abroad, it must be clear about it, does

22

not that doctrine mean that we will accept strained

23

readings and will indeed impose strained readings in order

24

to defeat extraterritorial jurisdiction, unless Congress

25

has been clear about it?

You're mistaking my question.

I'm granting

But I'm saying, does not our doctrine that

1

and foreign commerce, or when Congress says that, we do

2

not interpret that to mean anybody engaged in foreign

3

commerce abroad.

4

reading, don't you?

5

And I think that's a pretty strained

MR. STARR:

I don't think, in response to your

6

question, that the Court should engage in a clear

7

statement form of analysis that it has done in the

8

Eleventh Amendment setting, in tribal sovereign immunity

9

settings, in — in the law of preemption to require a

10

clear and unambiguous statement.

11

this context we're talking about Congress applying this

12

statute to — and intending to cover — American

13

enterprises.

14

laws against the backdrop of the law of conflicts of law.

15

And it is clear that its application to foreign nationals,

16

foreign entities, would raise very serious questions.

17

And that is this.

In

The Court frequently reads broadly drafted

such as Benz and McCulloch.

that there was absolute silence.

silence here.

That's what the Court had

We think the alien exemption provision is a
powerful provision.

It is a powerful message in terms of

Congress' intent.

2

What the Court said in Foley Brothers is here's

3

a statute that is very broadly worded, the Eight Hour Law.

4

There is no geographic limitation at all, and we have

5

found no indication whatsoever of what Congress had in

6

mind in terms of its applicability extraterritorially.

7

For us to apply it extraterritorially would require us to

8

require it, by its language, to foreign nationals.

9

that, we think Congress would have been clear if it had

And

10

intended it not to apply extraterritorially. but to foreign

11

nationals.

13

nationals in those foreign work places has been evident.

Congress has been — I think this is one thing

in that case simply it doesn't apply to foreign nationals.

2

We could have simply said it doesn't apply.

3

you're saying in this case.

4

this does not apply to employees who are foreign

nationals, but on its face it would apply to companies

abroad who are not United States companies, just as it

applies domestically to companies that are not United

States companies.

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

But when we look —

11

You want us to create an exception that is not in the

12

text.

13

MR. STARR:

The exception, however, is one with

14

respect to foreign employers that is powerfully suggested

15

by the history of this provision and the way this Court

16

has historically gone about the analysis of broadly worded

17

statutes against the backdrop of conflicts of law.

12

QUESTION:

General Starr, the more of these

13

unexpressed exceptions you have to read into the statute

to make it work, the less it strikes me as clear, which

our opinions say it has to be, that the statute is meant

The standard for liability has been established by Title

available to the State, but not based upon stereotypes and

the like.

provisions of BFOQ.

It would have to satisfy the stringent

But when we are dealing with the law of a

6

7

foreign nation, we're then in an area where there are

8

these understandable areas of concern and sensitivity, and

9

that's why the question that has been presented to this

10

Court is very narrow and very specific.

11

doesn't contest that the question before this Court is the

12

applicability of Title VII to U.S. employers.

13

And ARAMCO

My ultimate response, Justice Scalia, to this

14

line of questioning is let that wait for another day.

15

in discussing that, in looking to that other day and being

16

mindful that that case will eventually arise, the comfort

17

that I want to give you is that the EEOC, the agency

18

charged with interpreting this statute, has very

reasonably interpreted it as not applying to foreign

corporations.

kind of conflict of laws analysis time and time again.

And this Court has done precisely the same

3

QUESTION:

And you say that's different because

the statute was written differently?
MR. STARR:

It is different because when we look

4

at what Foley Brothers — the analysis of the Court in

5

Foley Brothers, the statement of the canon of construction

6

is is there — the presumption is it applies only

7

domestically unless a contrary intent appears.

8

Court then engages in the analysis of the statute, it

9

notes one very pivotal thing in addition to Congress'

When the

10

silence, that Congress — at page 286 of the opinion —

11

that Congress in the act drew no distinction between alien

12

labor and citizen labor.

13

failed to draw that distinction, resonated powerfully with

14

the Court that Congress would not have intended therefore

15

for the law to have applied overseas by virtue of the

16

oddity, as the Court saw it, of it applying, it being the

17

Eight-Hour Statute, to Iranian nationals working in Iran

18

on a U.S. project.

And that fact, that Congress

MR. STARR:

Is there any statutory definition of

There is, Mr. Chief Justice.

It is

found in the definitional provisions in 20Q,0e(i).

United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the

Virgin Islands, and a number of other territories of the

The

United States.
QUESTION:

2

So they — the way they define

3

"state," the alien exemption, saying employment of aliens

4

outside any "state," would mean outside of any State or

5

territory, basically.

6

MR. STARR:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, what about, say, the American

8

Embassy in Paris?

9

the exclusion for the term "state," is applicable to the

10

I take it the act, even if you look at

American Embassy in Paris?

11

MR. STARR:

I think that's right.

12

fall within the definition —

13

QUESTION:

That does not

And that would — that would make the

14

exemption have some sense, because it would mean that, I

15

take it an American citizen would be protected by the act

16

in the American Embassy, but that an alien would not be?
MR. STARR:

17

That is correct.

An alien would not

18

be able to avail himself or herself of the protections of

19

Title VII.

20

Congress would have drafted the statute and created this

21

sort of scheme of coverage.

22

experience is instructive, because when Congress learned

23

that the obvious result of its incorporating the Fair

24

Labor Standards Act geographic limitation in the ADEA,

25

when it learned the consequences of that, that Americans

It is not at all odd or anomalous that

2

say we have an anomaly in the coverage of the anti-

discrimination laws of the United States.

4

to end that anomaly.

Congress was reminded of what it was already charged with

knowledge of, namely —

20

now, as it was not in 1964, covered by the act, I think

21

that ARAMCO's position would be that unless there are

22

other coverages, executive orders, other bodies of law to

23

which a person would look who is employed by an embassy,

then, indeed, Title VII does not apply overseas.

a short period of time, I think they do contemplate a

3

sensible reading of the statute to that limited extent.

4

But if someone is actually employed in Paris or in Tokyo

his or her career, their vision of Title VII is not

applicable to a U.S. employer.

exception?

foreign workers, that constitutes a clear expression of

Congress?

Now, what clear expression do you find in this

What is

I have to, with all respect, quarrel

21

with your reading out of the commerce definition, foreign

commerce, by virtue of the magic words not being there.

The words — the definition of commerce includes commerce

outside any State.

25

commerce which make it very, very global in its reach.

There are several definitions of

MR. STARR:

I

Exactly.

Anyplace outside there,

11

Justice White, is exactly that.

12

Anyplace means, to me, especially given the other

13

definitions — the opening definition is the Constitution,

14

the commerce clause definition of interstate commerce,

15

commerce affecting among the several States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. FRIEDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5
6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

We agree with the Solicitor General that this is

8

a question of statutory interpretation.

9

with him that what is involved here is what he today has

10

referred to as the well-established presumption against

11

extraterritorial application of U.S. laws.

12

there are several problems, at least five, before one even

13

gets to the presumption, with his position.

14

We also agree

But we think

One is the language of the statute.

It says

15

nothing about an extraterritorial reach.

16

legislative history, which says nothing about foreign work

17

places, nothing about extraterritoriality.

18

no indication in that legislative history, despite the

19

fact that there were 441 witnesses who testified, that

20

anybody thought this was going to apply overseas.

21

Second is the

And there is

Third, the structure and the legislative history

22

of the act talk only in terms of a domestic focus of the

23

act.

24

really is no principled basis to limit this statute to

25

U.S. employers overseas once you start down that road.

Fourth, as Justice Scalia's questions suggest, there

prerogatives and sovereignty of other nations and with

4

presumption which says that Congress must speak clearly,

5

expressly, and affirmatively if it intends a statute to

7

And then you get to the

Now I, I think I understand the Solicitor

8

General to be saying either that the alien exemption

provision itself grants coverage to U.S. citizens overseas

10

by a negative inference, or he may be saying that it is

11

the commerce language which grants coverage to everybody,

12

and then the alien exemption provision withdraws it from

13

aliens.

14

15

problems that the Court was discussing with the Solicitor

General a few moments ago.

The language, commerce between a State and any

other — and any foreign nation, which arguably is broader

3

or suggests a stronger indication that Congress may have

4

intended what the Solicitor General argues, is not found

5

in this statute, but it is found in the National Labor

6

Relations Act, on which this statute was patterned, in the

7

Labor Management Relations Act, on which this statute was

8

patterned, and this Court has said that neither of those

9

apply extraterritorially.

It is also found in the Federal

10

Employers' Liability Act, the Railway Labor. Act, and even

11

Title II, the Public Accommodation section of the Civil

12

Rights Act.

13

Stewards and some other cases, have been held not to apply

extraterritorially.

15

to my knowledge, that the Public Accommodation section

16

does .

17

Those statutes, and Chisholm and Air Line

Of course, no one has ever suggested,

So we suggest that his position is a troublesome

18

one if he is relying on the notion that this commerce

19

language alone provides jurisdiction.

20

something beyond that, which he also seems to be saying in

21

his brief, that this statute is an example of Congress

22

legislating on the nationality principle.

23

entirely clear in the various earlier portions of this

24

case and maybe even in some of the Solicitor General's

25

earlier submissions to this Court, but it is now clear

Now, if he's saying

(202)289-2260

It wasn't

1
2

that he's relying on the nationality principle.
The nationality principle is a disfavored basis

3

to exercise jurisdiction.

It applies usually in matters

4

of allegiance, like military service and taxation, when we

5

reach overseas to reach our nationals.

6

Congress has chosen to legislate on that principle, it has

7

used the words expressly:

8

U.S. national.

9

Department of Defense statute in — cited by the Solicitor

10

General, and of course the Department of Defense is a U.S.

person, in every single statute cited by the Solicitor

12

General in his reply brief at footnote 13 on page 16.

And every time

I believe it did so, except in the

13

With respect to anti-discrimination statutes,

14

the only cases that I am aware of in which Congress has

15

chosen to reach into foreign work places are the Export

16

Administration Act, the comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act,

17

and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, where

18

Congress, in each case, spoke about U.S. persons, U.S.

19

nationals, or, in the case of the amended Anti — Age

20

Discrimination Act, American employers.

21

And so, regardless of whether you approach it on

22

the commerce language approach or on th^ notion that

23

Congress acted affirmatively somehow, it hasn't done it in

24

a way that this Court has accepted that Congress must do

25

it in order to reach into foreign territory.

The Steele and Lanham Act question, it seems to

There are a number of reasons.

1

in the definition of commerce itself, which would — is

2

what of course gives jurisdiction to Congress to legislate

3

nationally rather than leaving things to the State, but

4

rather in each of those cases, I believe, in the

5

proscribed conduct provisions of the statutes they talk

6

about conduct in interstate or foreign commerce, restraint

7

of trade and commerce, monopolization of trade or commerce

8

between the States or with foreign nations, the use of

9

deceptive or misleading trademarks in interstate and

10

foreign commerce itself.

11

In this statute, we have a definition of

12

commerce and of interstate commerce which is, as the

dissent below said, nothing more than a jurisdictional

nexus.

the reference to commerce in statutes like the Sherman Act

of statutes on the books that reach overseas that nobody

ever thought would.

And I'm not sure they're entirely

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I'm not going to make the

Solicitor General's argument for him, but I did suggest,

13

and I think I'm right, that it has changed and shifted

14

from time to time, both in this Court and in the lower

15

courts as to whether the exemption provides coverage by a

16

negative inference, by exempting aliens therefore it

17

applies to U.S. citizens, or whether the commerce language

18

provides coverage and then the exemption withdraws it.

Either of them, it seems to us, is no the way that

statutes are normally construed.

the entire statute and try to figure out what commerce

clear from reading the statute and the legislative history

is that this was an unusual statute and had an unusual

But what is — what is

There were 172 civil

There were 441 witnesses, that, as I may have

mentioned, and days and days of debates, there were no

hearings in the Senate.

There were hearings on this

10

provision in the labor committee, but then the statute

11

went over to the judiciary committee.

12

sorts of amendments, there were substitute bills written

in the dead of night and delivered to congressmen's doors

exclude leased bases appeared for the first time.

QUESTION:

It is — it is set

What was the problem of Vermilya-

16

Brown that Congress was trying to avoid with this

17

exception?

18

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Congress — the Court said that

leased bases and military bases are possessions, and that

Even though they were located in

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Even though they were located in

24

foreign countries they were possessions.

And therefore

were aliens, were entitled to the same benefits I'd say-

most of them were not U.S. citizens — were entitled to

the same benefits, the same wages and hours and other

4

provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act in those,

"possessions" that everybody else was.

Now, what Justice Jackson in his dissent with

7

four other justices — three other justices.

8

been four he would have prevailed.

9

If there had

(Laughter.)

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But what Justice Jackson said in

11

his dissent is that that's a very strained reasoning —

12

reading of possessions, and that's not what Congress meant

13

by the term "possession," and it's not what Congress meant

14

in the Fair Labor Standards Act.

15

tremendous effort in — immediately after Vermilya-Brown,

16

in the Fair Employment Practices Act and ultimately in the

17

amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1957 — and

18

it was finally amended in 1957 because some people brought

19

some lawsuits saying they were entitled to the benefits

20

that Vermilya-Brown seemed to suggest they had.

21

the Government had been ignoring Vermilya-Brown for 6 --

22

for 8 years, or no one thought to ask for those same

benefits.

And so there was a

history of the Fair Employment Practices statutes, which

culminated in '64, explain how the alien exemption

provision got into the statute and may explain how — what

4

the alien exemption provision still meant when the '64 act

was adopted.

7

QUESTION:

Is there legislative history in

connection with the '64 act? —

8

MR. FRIEDMAN:

9

QUESTION:

None.

-- that shows.

10

So there is no legislative history in connection

11

with that act that would show how the alien exemption came

12

to be there?

13

MR. FRIEDMAN:

All we know is that in '49

14

Congressman Powell introduced it and there were various

15

statutes.

16

in the labor committee took language that had come up

17

through the years from the Fair Employment Practices Act

18

and wrote a bill.

19

and included that one sentence in the legislative history.

20

That — that bill didn't get out of the labor committee.

21

Congressman Roosevelt came over to the judiciary committee

22

one day and said this is much stronger than what President

23

Kennedy has proposed.

is a better statute.

And

provisions of the Civil — became the Civil Rights Act of

2

1964, ever discussed it from that moment forward.
QUESTION:

3

May I ask this, Mr. Friedman?

The

4

Vermilya-Brown problem, as I recall, it was a question of

5

defining the territory or the geographic area covered, and

6

the decision applied equally to American citizens and

7

aliens, and the correction applied equally to American

8

citizens and aliens.

9

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct.

It applied

10

equally to the American citizens and aliens,, and the

11

correction, we say, was -- attempted to be accomplished in

12

two ways.

13

leased bases are not possessions.

One was to redefine possessions to say that

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.
And the other was to deal

16

expressly with the problem of aliens and the problem of --

17

that foreign governments suggested —

18

QUESTION:

But that's dealing with the problem

19

of aliens in territories or geographic locations where

20

there was unquestioned Federal jurisdiction.

21
22

MR. FRIEDMAN:
both.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FRIEDMAN:

25

I think it's — I think it's

I see.
I think it's both, because, again

if you look at the, for example, the dissenting opinion in

1

— I forget, the concurring opinion in Foley Brothers by

2

Justice Frankfurter and Justice Reed, who were trying to

3

relitigate Vermilya-Brown, if I might say so, at that

4

point, they were, they were discussing the reactions that

5

we got from foreign governments and from the Defense

6

Department and others that —

7

QUESTION:

And they also relied heavily on

8

letters from different parts of the executive branch of

9

our Government, too.

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

But you don't have any such support

in this case.

13
14

They did.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, the Solicitor General is

here.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I guess that the next thing I —

17

I don't know if I need to make this point because it came

18

clear from the discussion between Justice Scalia and Mr.

19

Starr, that this statute would apply to foreign employers

20

as well as to U.S. employers if it were extended

21

extraterritorially.

22

one starts down that road because th^re is really no

23

principled basis on which to make those distinctions.

And it's just a host of problems if

24

And one wonders why the Solicitor General does

25

not require Congress or -- to have a statutory exemption

1

for alien or foreign employers, and asks the Court to do

2

that for them, when it's the alien exemption for foreign

3

employees that he is relying on here.

4

And one wonders whether he would also limit the

5

term employer to U.S. employers in this country, even

6

though the suggestion of Sumitomo and the suggestion of

7

the lower courts that have followed Sumitomo is that when

8

in the United States, absent a treaty to the contrary, a

9

foreign employer is bound by Title VII.

Query:

shouldn't

10

we be bound by their employment laws and their

11

discrimination laws when we do business as their guests in

12

their country?

13

There are 55 nations at least that have adopted

14

employment discrimination laws of their own, and most of

15

them, including Saudi Arabia's, provide for exclusive

16

jurisdiction and say expressly that they regulate all

17

employment within the country's borders, including those

18

involving foreign citizens.

19

have intended — and that's what this case is about,

20

congressional intent — to impose our law unilaterally in

21

light of that.

22

that in light of ILO Convention 111 and some other

23

international documents.

24

every country should act nationally within its own

25

sovereignty to deal with employment discrimination.

We don't think Congress could

We don't think Congress could have done

But ILO 111 says that, that

1

We also think that to apply this would create

2

specific conflicts, not just conflicts with dual

3

sovereigns trying to regulate the same conduct, but

4

specific, specific conflicts that are suggested in the

5

brief of amicus Rule of Law Committee.

6

might say, in other cases.

But they're different.

There

10

are other kinds of conflicts, obviously, which might arise

11

as well between the law -- between Title VII and the laws

12

of other countries.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, what about the

14

deference we normally accord to the agency that is charged

15

with implementing the act?

16

no doubt that that's the agency committed with the

17

responsibility for this act, and they simply disagree with

18

you on a matter that is arguably ambiguous.

19

isn't their call what governs?

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Here it's the EEOC.

There is

Why, why

Well, their call — and maybe we

21

should use the word plural, calls — their call has

22

changed dramatically over the years.

23

24

saying what the Court said in Espinoza, that the alien

25

exemption provision means that aliens are protected in

Their current policy

3

They don't just say it applies to U.S. employers.

4

say it applies to some foreign employers.

5

have a whole list of factors that they're going to apply.

6

It seems to us that you don't give deference to

They

And then they

8

completely trying to rewrite a statute;

9

(2) when their

10

really said this — was not contemporaneous.; (3) when it's

11

inconsistent from over the course of the years;

12

it's inconsistent with the language, the legislative

13

history of the statute itself, and (5) when it's only a

14

guideline and not a regulation because they don't have

15

authorities to — authority to issue regulations in this

16

area; and (6) when it deals with their own jurisdiction.

17

They're not experts either on their own jurisdiction or in

18

foreign relations law.

19

(4) when

There are a whole host — and fundamentally

20

they're wrong.

21

the Court ought not to give deference to the EEOC in this

case.

for example.

do that, obviously.

ought not to.

(Laughter.)

10

No, actually I don't, Your Honor.

Exactly.

Yeah.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

In the end, in the. end the

11

question of whether this was good policy — what what the

12

Solicitor General argues was good policy in 1964 was a

13

question for Congress, and we say they didn't do it.

14

it's good policy in 1991, Congress can do it.

the Age Discrimination Act; it passed a civil rights bill

this year, which was vetoed; it deals with discrimination

QUESTION:

1

I guess there isn't much question

2

that the present Congress has been under the impression

3

that it applies to U.S. employers of U.S. citizens

4

overseas.

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I — whether — there's not much

6

question that Senator Grassley thought it applied.

7

said so at the time of the age discrimination hearings,

8

that he thought it applied overseas.

9

thought the age discrimination statute applied, and the

He

He also said that he

10

only reason to amend it was to clarify it. . The Chairman

11

of the EEOC disagreed with him on that point.

12

Senator Grassley was referring to two district

13

court decisions in support of his view, and one of them

14

was dicta and one of them was overruled.

15

it's quite fair to say that the Congress agreed.

16

it's fair to say that one Senator agreed.

17

there have been some statements in the public press by

18

other Congressmen that they would seek to amend the

19

statute if this Court rules in our favor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. STARR:

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

6

think we should understand what is at stake and what

7

ARAMCO is saying, that ARAMCO and other U.S. employers are

8

free to discriminate overseas on grounds of race,

9

religion, national origin, and gender, and the like.

10

Very briefly, Mr. Friedman has quite properly

11

used the term "canon of construction."

12

exactly what we are dealing with in terms of the judicial

13

tools to employ in getting at the ultimate question of

14

what Congress intended.

the fair inference to be drawn from a reading of the

clearly, that it is in fact the combination of the broad

23

jurisdictional reach within the structural creation of an

applicability.

2

With respect to the specifics and the

3

legislative history on Vermilya-Brown, one critical point

4

is Vermilya-Brown was effectively revisited legislatively

5

in 1957.

6

Brown was therefore taken care of several years before the

7

focus on the 172 bills that Mr. Friedman suggests so

8

dominated the legislative history of the '64 statute,

9

which is what we're about here.

The problem that Congress had with Vermilya-

That Congress was

10

nonetheless trying to fix up a problem that, had been fixed

11

in 1957.

12

What that —
QUESTION:

But General Starr, I'm not sure I

13

have the various language in mind, but I think the

14

argument ran that during that fixing up of Vermilya-Brown

15

they adopted language which was much like this, and the

16

pattern, you just assume that when they copied language

17

which was used previously it may have had the same

18

purpose.

19

Isn't that what their argument is?
MR. STARR:

I think that is — that there may

20

have been some lingering problem, but to the extent there

21

was a congressional problem, Vermilya-Brown handled it.

22

And here is the key point which they don't dispute.

23

all of it, the legislative history -- it is not extensive

24

-- but all of it is in our favor with respect to what this

25

alien exemption meant in this statute.

this exemption is that it provides an exemption with
