ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL B. RUDIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUDIN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

As in the case of Gomez against United States,

12

the critical jury selection stage of petitioner's felony

13

trial was conducted by a magistrate from whom Congress had

14

withheld the authority to preside.

15

concedes that this was error.

16

which the parties disagree is whether or not the issue was

17

preserved for this Court's review despite counsel's

18

purported consent on petitioner's behalf.

19

issue was preserved because the defect was not subject to

20

waiver, and that if it was subject to waiver the requisite

21

statutory or constitutional waiver standard was not met.

22

The Solicitor General

The principal issue about

The framers gave Congress exclusive power to

1

jurisdiction, and to allocate or to distribute power to be

2

exercised by these officers.

3

The framers gave Congress the exclusive power to

4

adjust the allocation of jurisdiction in the lower Federal

5

courts to meet changing societal needs, so long as the

6

adjustment was within the constraints of article III.

7

The magistrates act was an attempt by Congress

8

to do just that, to meet the litigation explosion of the

9

latter part of the 20th century by creating the new office

10

of magistrate, by defining its jurisdiction powers and

11

duties, and then, as this Court pointed out in Gomez, by

12

carefully circumscribing magistrates' trial jurisdiction

13

in the interest of policy as well as constitutional

14

constraints.

15

Congress gave magistrates consent trial

16

jurisdiction in the area of misdemeanor and petty offense

17

trials and for civil trials, but withheld consent trial

18

jurisdiction for magistrates in felony cases.

19

Solicitor General concedes that this withholding applies

20

to the critical voir dire stage of a felony trial.

21

And the

A district court may not override Congress'

22

policy judgment to withhold this jurisdiction from

23

magistrates, and petitioner could not consent to consent

24

trial jurisdiction being exercised when Congress had

25

withheld such trial jurisdiction.

And in our view any

1

such consent would be a nullity, and therefore counsel's

2

waiver was a nullity and could not prevent petitioner from

3

raising the defect on appeal.

QUESTION:

5

MR. RUDIN:

(Inaudible) waiver?
Your Honor, it was not an effective

waiver.

7

It was a — it could not be an effective waiver for the

8

reasons that I have just explained, and as I will go on

9

later in my argument to explain, even if a waiver could be

10

made in this area it would have to meet the standards set

11

by Congress and by the Constitution in order for the

12

waiver to forfeit petitioner's right to appeal.

13

An officer's — the Glidden case, we believe,

14

disposes of this case, at least on the question of whether

15

or not the error may be reviewed by this Court.

16

Glidden case, in an opinion by Justice Harlan, the Court

17

reached the merits of the petitioner's article III

18

argument even though the court that delegated power to an

19

officer, who arguably was not an article III officer,

20

itself had subject matter jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

Rudin, in Glidden?

It was an
But

1

there were four other members of the Court who

2

participated in the decision, two in a dissenting opinion

3

and two in a plurality opinion, and none of them took

4

issue with Justice Harlan's analysis of whether or not the

5

error could be reviewed by the Court, even though the

6

petitioners had not objected in the courts below.

7

In the Glidden case there were two matters that

8

were consolidated.

One case involved a criminal trial in

9

the district court in the District of Columbia in which a

10

judge from the court of customs and patent appeals

11

presided.

12

not an article III judge and therefore, consistent with

13

the Constitution, could not preside.

14

And the petitioner argued that that judge was

The other case involved an appeal to the court

15

of appeals in the Second Circuit in which one of the three

16

judges who was designated to preside by the chief justice

17

of the United States and by the chief judge of the court

18

of appeals of the Second Circuit was a court of claims

19

judge.

20

not have jurisdiction to preside under article III.

21

And again, petitioner argued that that judge did

Justice Harlan in his opinion treated this

22

defect as a nonwaivable jurisdictional type defect because

23

it was necessary to do so to permit this Court to protect

24

institutional interests that were far broader than the

25

narrow interests of an individual litigant.

parallel to that you would have to establish that there

was not only a violation of the statute here, but a

violation of article III.

MR. RUDIN:

Well, Your Honor, I would

respectfully —
QUESTION:

And so far all you have said is that

8

this was not in accordance with the statutory

9

requirements.

10

MR. RUDIN:

Your Honor, I would respectfully

11

disagree with the premise of Your Honor's question because

12

it — my understanding of article III is that for an

13

officer to exercise judicial authority under article III

14

there need not only be inherent authority for Congress to

15

confer the jurisdiction, but Congress in fact has to then

16

confer the jurisdiction.

17

other cases in which this Court has discussed article III

18

issues and the exercise of power by nonarticle III

19

officers or the exercise of judicial power by adjuncts, in

20

every single one of those cases the power was exercised

21

pursuant to a statutory scheme.

22

QUESTION:

In the Schor case and all the

statutory scheme is in compliance with article III, all
you have is a violation of the statute, and that is not
comparable to what was the problem in Glidden.
MR. RUDIN:

Well, Your Honor, we certainly have

argued in our brief and I am prepared to argue this
morning that there was an inherent violation of article
III, that had Congress authorized this function to be
exercised, that it would have violated article III.

But

Congress did not even authorize the function to be
exercised.

And this Court has said over and over and over

again that there is no authority or jurisdiction for an
officer to exercise the judicial power of the United
States in an article III setting unless Congress has
authorized that exercise of power.
That was true in the Schor case.

In the Schor

case the petitioner, or the litigant, invited an article I
tribunal before the CFTC to exercise jurisdiction over his
— that petitioner's claim.

And even though petitioner

had invited the tribunal to exercise that jurisdiction,
this Court still reached the merits of the petitioner's
structural article III claim, even though it could be said
that petitioner had invited the jurisdictional error.
There is simply no such thing as invited jurisdictional
error.
The same rule was applied in the Owen Equipment

been brought in the State court under the statutory

this Court the petitioner successfully argued that that

because it exceeded what Congress had authorized.

MR. RUDIN:

Well, Your Honor, I suppose that

21

there can be a distinction made between whether or not the

22

court that delegates the authority has subject matter

23

jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction or the authority of the

24

officer who actually exercises the jurisdiction.

authority to make that delegation, and Congress prohibited

3

the district courts from making this type of delegation.

4

But it seems to me that it's significant as to

5

whether or not the officer who exercises the jurisdiction,

6

which is really the matter that we should be concerned

7

with, who actually exercises the jurisdiction, in this

8

case that officer, the magistrate, did not have

jurisdiction, did not have power given to him by Congress

10

to preside over the subject matter of a felony trial or a

11

critical stage of that trial, and that being voir dire.

12

In the Northern Pipeline case an argument was

13

made that bankruptcy judges were adjuncts of the district

court, and that it was the district court that had subject

matter jurisdiction, and the bankruptcy judges derived

16

jurisdiction from the jurisdiction that the district

17

courts had.

18

termed that a facade — that the jurisdictional grant was

19

a facade because the officer who actually exercised the

jurisdiction was not in power to do so.

1

exercised the jurisdiction did not.

And Justice Harlan

2

felt that that was akin to a jurisdictional error or at

3

least should be treated by the Court as a jurisdictional-

4

type error so that the Court could reach the truly

5

important interest, which was not whether or not an

6

individual litigant was deserving of a new trial or

7

whether or not he somehow could be blamed for not having

8

made an explicit objection, but rather to protect the

9

proper administration of judicial business, which is this

10

Court's obligation in the Federal system.

Justice Harlan put it.

13

of powers.

14

That is the way

And also to protect the

If the error that occurred to this case — that

15

occurred in this case is treated as waivable, and

16

therefore this Court does not reach the merits of the

17

error which the Government concedes, then there will be no

18

change in the law in the Second and the Third Circuits.

19

Both those circuits have held that the magistrate does "

20

have power under the additional duties clause, despite

21

this Court's analysis in Gomez, to preside at voir dire.

22

As recently as within the last 6 months a judge

23

in the Eastern District of New York attempted, with the

24

defendant's consent that he asked for and obtained, to

25

delegate voir dire to a magistrate.

And the Government

had to go to the Second Circuit in In Re Sayeedi and ask

2

the Second Circuit to grant the writ of mandamus to

3

prevent the judge from doing that.

4

that the obvious reason the judge did — the Government

5

did that was that they were concerned that built-in

6

reversible error would occur.

7

And I would submit

Interestingly, in the Second Circuit in their

8

opinion in Sayeedi, even though they had held in the

9

Musacchia case that, despite Gomez, it was okay for a

10

magistrate to conduct felony voir dire if the defendant

11

did not make a written motion under rule 12(b)(2)

12

asserting his right to voir dire before a district judge,

13

the Second Circuit in Sayeedi said that for the Government

14

it was okay to object at the time of trial.

15

And it equated the right involved for the

16

Government as equal to the right to trial by jury, and

17

said that if the Government, if trial by jury can only

18

occur, a waiver of that can only occur where the defendant

19

makes a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent consent and if

20

the Government makes a consent as well, then this right is

21

at least as important and that therefore the Government

22

should be entitled to object to protect all of society's

23

interests.

checks and balances-type error.

what could be referred to as a power grab from Congress,

2

took over from Congress its exclusive authority under the

3

Constitution to determine the allocation of power in the

district courts.

At the same time —

You can say that whenever

it to do.

you don't obey Congress as you should.

12

mean, in that sense everything is a violation of

separation of powers.

MR. RUDIN:

Right?

But, I

Nothing is unlawful unless it is.
Well, Your Honor, there I would

procedure that they employ to adjudicate matters that

22

I think that where the Congress

It's not a

But even if the Court were to view this as a

procedural issue rather than a jurisdictional or

24

separation of powers issue, it seems to me that Congress

1

question of whether or not this procedural right is

2

waivable can be determined merely by analyzing the

3

statute.

4

upon the familiar principle that the Court will attempt to

5

construe statutes to avoid constitutional issues,

6

especially issues involving separation of powers.

7

Of course in the Gomez case this Court relied

QUESTION:

Well, to call this a separation of

8

powers case is, I think, a misnomer.

I mean, the

9

magistrate is not doing something — he's being supervised

10

by an article III judge.

11

judicial power is being infringed on.

12

MR. RUDIN:

It's not as if somehow the

No, Your Honor, it's — this case

13

really has, it seems to me, has two components in terms of

14

the separation of powers analysis.

15

about it is that up until, certainly during the Gomez case

16

and in the cases that followed Gomez the issue has been

17

analyzed as whether or not Congress infringed upon the

18

power of the judiciary by authorizing magistrates to carry

19

out this function.

20

as the Government concedes, Congress did not authorize

21

magistrates to carry out this function.

22

difficult to say that Congress is infringing upon the

23

power of the judiciary when the judiciary asserts a

24

basically inherent authority to transfer, to delegate its

25

jurisdiction to someone from whom Congress has withheld

And what's strange

But what is strange about it is that

So it is

1

that power.

2

It seems to me that the separation of powers

3

problems here and the problem of checks and balances under

4

the — as the framers intended that to work, is that the

5

district court here asserted its right to delegate power,

6

and this is a jurisdictional statute that repeatedly uses

7

terms like "jurisdiction" and "power to preside," to a

8

magistrate that Congress had implicitly forbidden to

9

exercise that power.

11

QUESTION:

MR. RUDIN:

16

But a jurisdictional statute, Your

Honor.

So it's a violation of a law passed

by Congress.

And so the problem —

I mean, that's a cloak of many colors.
MR. RUDIN:

That is true.

But there is no other

17

source of authority for an officer, a judicial officer to

act, except to the extent that that officer is empowered

19

by Congress to do so.

of diversity jurisdiction.

2

would have eased the burden somewhat.

3

That certainly would have —

Or Congress could have decided that because the

4

volume of misdemeanor and petty offense cases is so great,

5

and perhaps compared to the volume of felonies maybe there

6

are less felonies, that we'll allow magistrates to preside

7

at felonies and not criminal trials or petty offenses.

8

10
11

QUESTION:

Mr. Rudin, do you think Congress

could have expressly authorized the use of magistrates to
make the initial voir dire of jurors?
MR. RUDIN:

No, Your Honor.

The reason is that

12

the judicial power under article III must in the final

13

analysis be exercised, especially in a criminal case, by

14

an article III judge.

15

QUESTION:

That is why —
Well, do you think since the ultimate

16

seating of the jury is left for the judge, that our

17

holding in Raddatz speaks to this issue?

18

MR. RUDIN:

Well, it speaks to the issue, but I

19

don't think it determines the issue.

20

of course in Raddatz, the Court repeatedly, explicitly

21

relied on the existence of a very careful statutory scheme

22

which provided guidance for the Court and for the parties

23

as to the procedure to be followed, that in the statutory

24

scheme required that the magistrate make written findings

25

of fact and conclusions of law, that it's recommended

The reason is that,

1

findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the

2

district judge was obligated to review independently and

3

to go on to review de novo any aspects of the magistrate's

4

decision that a party objected to.

5
6

QUESTION:

How is it, then, that a magistrate

can preside over a misdemeanor trial?

7

MR. RUDIN:

What the Raddatz case, I think, went

8

to great pains to point out with the decision it pointed

9

out was that the degree of review that must be provided

10

under article III must be directly related to the

11

importance of the interest under article III that is in

12

question.

13

why the Raddatz case focused on the distinction between

14

the interest at stake in a pretrial suppression hearing,

15

where the ultimate question of truth or innocence is not

16

involved, and the trial itself.

17

believe, why Justice Marshall in Raddatz dissented,

18

because Justice Marshall did not accept that distinction.

19

and may it

1

please the Court:
Let me begin very briefly by addressing the

2

3

point raised near the end of the argument with respect to

4

rule 31 and the nonwaivability of unanimous jury.

5

Court in Lopez, through Justice Kennedy sitting as a

6

circuit justice — judge — held that the rule itself,

7

viewing it to the language and the legislative history of

8

the rule, indicated that a unanimous jury was nonwaivable.

9

That was a construction of the rule, and obviously

The

10

Congress or this Court, through its rule — the

11

promulgation of the rules — can decide that a particular

12

error will be nonwaivable.

14

If it says so in effect or in

This case does not involve a congressional

15

declaration that a particular error is nonwaivable, and

16

therefore we have to look at more general principles —

17

the contemporaneous objection rule, the invited error

18

doctrine — and ask whether in this particular case there

19

is anything that takes this case and like cases out of

20

those doctrines.

21

Now, it's important to emphasize, I think, at

22

the outset that this case involves a very narrow question

of remedy.

it, that there was an error.

25

the consequence of the error in this particular case.

This is a case in which it is true, as we see
But the question is what is

it — does it require reversal.
And we submit that there should be very few case

2

3

where the law will say that — or will recognize a

4

defendant coming in and saying yes, I asked for a

5

particular procedure, yes, I got the procedure that I

asked for, but no, I wasn't entitled to it and therefore

please reverse my conviction.

8

this case comes down to, and we have to ask the question

9

is there some reason that we are required to reverse in

10

this case, in spite of the defendant's having asked for

11

the procedure, precisely the procedure that he got.

MR. BRYSON:

There's been no harm done.
No, there has been no harm done,

12

but not — it's not the case that everything is fine.

13

What's happened is there has been a violation of the law.

14

The district judge, to assign a jury selection to a

magistrate, if this Court were to hold that that is a

violation of the law, as we believe it is, would have to

are going to do.

majority which held that, number one, the jury selection

2

could not be referred to a magistrate, but number two,

3

found that it was not plain error in that case because the

4

matter was not raised by the defendant.
And there's a footnote at the end of the en banc

5
6

majority's opinion in which the court said we assume

7

confidently that district judges will not simply disregard

8

our holding and assign things to the magistrates, even

9

though there may be consent to the doing of that.
I would — I think there's an analogy, if I may,

11

with a case a few years ago from this Court, Parker

12

against Randolf, which held that a -- the introduction, I

13

believe, of cross-corroborating confessions was error but

14

it was always harmless error.

15

course, well, district judges could simply introduce —

16

allow that kind of evidence to come in because it will

17

always be regarded as harmless error and never, therefore

18

never result in reversal.

19

Now, you could say, of

But the answer to that, it seems to me, is that

20

it is the obligation of the district court to follow the

21

law.

We can assume the district courts will follow the

22

law.

judges will disregard their obligations.

that jurisdiction, when there is jurisdictional error that

can constitutionally be assigned to magistrates.

think that you can find a distinction in article III or in

district judge maintains control of the proceedings, as
long as the essential attributes of judicial power are
preserved in the district court.

Now, and the second line

of cases is a case illustrated by the Schor case, in which
the Court has attached great weight to the presence of
consent with respect to the waiver of the individual
component of the article III right.
It's important, I think, in focusing on the
article III claim to see just exactly what it is we have
here with respect to a magistrate.

We have an officer

who, it was appointed by the district court, who is
removable by the district court, who is supervised in
everything that he or she does by the district court,
who's subject to the district court's appointment in the
particular case.

The district court does not have, by law

or practice or rule, have to assign the magistrate to a
particular case.

And the district court may withdraw from

the magistrate the reference at any time.

The

magistrate's work, moreover, is subject to whatever degree
of review the district court can perform, upon the party's
request, if they should request it.
In this case, and I think that this is a very
important point, in this particular case there was no
request for a review, and there's a good reason, because

MR. BRYSON:

Well, if the statute — I'm not

sure a statute that required that they be sent, that all

I don't want to suggest that.

think that's a harder constitutional argument than the
constitutional argument that would be faced by a statute
that permitted it.

Now, the language that you propose, I

think, could be read as suggesting that there ought, the
district court has to have some good cause for withholding
cases from the magistrate.

But assuming that the district

court is, by the statute, given the authority to choose
yea or nay, then I think that that is precisely the kind
of thing that this Court has found in the Raddatz case to
be an important element of not creating a violation of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL B. RUDIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUDIN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

First of

13

all, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, if the

14

defect that occurred in this case was not waivable, then

15

we submit that no objection was required.

16

objection was required, then the Court cannot punish this

17

defendant for not having made an objection.

18

And if no

Second of all, Mr. Bryson has left out of his

19

analysis a critical exception to the plain error rule, and

20

that exception is that where Congress fixes the waiver

21

standard, whether it be by the Johnson v. Zerbst knowing,

22

intelligent, and voluntary standard or that it be not

23

waivable at all, the Court cannot require the defendant to

24

object.

25

not, for failing to object when the right that's involved

Again, the Court cannot punish the defendant for

is such an important structural right that Congress has

2

required either that it not be waivable or that any waiver

3

by the defendant meet the Johnson v. Zerbst standard.

We submit that in this case, this case can be

5

decided as a matter of statutory construction and the

6

constitutional issues that have been raised this morning

7

can be avoided.

The reason is —

QUESTION:

You're saying that the only cases in

which we can require an objection to be made are cases

10

where the matter would be waivable?

11

that comports with all our cases?

12

sweeping rule.

13

MR. RUDIN:

Are you sure that
It seems to me a very

If Congress makes a determination,

14

Your Honor, that a particular procedure, or I shouldn't

15

say procedure, that a particular exercise of power is

16

something that cannot be done by a particular judicial

17

officer, then all I am arguing is that an objection cannot

18

be required to that exercise of power, because it's

19

Congress' prerogative in taking into account all sorts of

20

societal interests that go beyond the narrow interest of

21

the defendant not to make it waivable.

22

On the other hand, Congress can be paternalistic

23

and can say that the right is so important, the right to

24

trial before a proper- judge or trial before the proper

25

entity, as the Court put it in Gomez, is so important that

we're not going to permit a judge to ask a defendant
whether or not he wants to waive that right, where the
judge is the person who will be presiding at the balance
of the trial and will be able to sentence the defendant
upon conviction, as in this case, to life in prison.

Mr.

Peretz was charged with a mandatory 10 year offense where
he was facing up to life in prison.
Finally, the Government keeps on trying to
trivialize the defect that occurred in this case.

The

defect occurred involving what this Court in Gomez called
a critical stage of trial, where the right to trial before
a judge of competent jurisdiction attached.

This Court

uses the term "critical," calls a right critical when it's
not de minimis or not inconsequential.

The Court in Gomez

pointed out the inseparability between —
