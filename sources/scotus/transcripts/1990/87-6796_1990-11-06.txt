ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. OGLETREE, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. OGLETREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
James A. Ford is here after the Georgia Supreme

12

Court, in light of this Supreme Court's ruling and remand,

13

failed, in our opinion, to apply an adequate and

14

independent state ground to justify the denial of his reef

15

— relief, under Batson v. Kentucky.

16

Ford, a black defendant, was tried in Coweta County,

17

Georgia, on a capital murder case.

18

In this case Mr.

At the time of this trial, Mr. Ford's lawyer

19

filed a motion specifically asking the court pretrial to

20

restrict the prosecutor from using its peremptory

21

challenges in a racially discriminatory manner that would

22

exclude members of the black race from the jury.

23

in the argument of that motion pretrial, Mr. Ford's lawyer

24

specifically asked the court to require the district

25

attorney if he does use his peremptory challenges to

In fact,

by his reasons for doing so.

And he went on to say the

failure to do so would conclude, lead to the conclusion
that it was only done because those jurors were in fact
black.
At the time this motion was made the court and
the prosecutor was clear that Mr. Ford was asking for
relief, not only in terms of what Swain v. Alabama held,
but beyond that.
case.

He was asking for relief in his specific

In fact, he also had complied completely with the

uniform appellate procedure in Georgia.

That procedure at

the time required counsel to pretrial file motions on all
issues so that the court could rule on them in a timely
and reasonable fashion.
Moreover, that procedure did not say anything
about specifically how peremptory challenges should be
handled, because in 1984, when this case was tried, there
were not procedures in Georgia specifically telling
counsel about the time and manner in which these arguments
could be made.
QUESTION:

Can there be any quibble, counsel,

over whether or not it's clear that a Fourteenth Amendment
Swain claim was raised, as opposed to a Sixth Amendment

Is the record clear

on that point?

MR. OGLETREE:

unmistakably clear on that point.

it in his pretrial motion, he argued it at the time of the

4

motion.

5

his brief in direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court he

specifically raises the Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth

7

Amendment claims.

8

explicitly in his motion —

9

Counsel not only argued

The prosecutor and court assumed it as that.

QUESTION:

In

He raised the Fourteenth Amendment

What, what about at the trial?

MR. OGLETREE:

10

Justice Kennedy, the record is

It was pretrial, we submit, that

11

on the — in the pretrial motion it was clear that he was

12

raising a Fourteenth Amendment claim, as well as a Sixth

13

Amendment claim.

14

QUESTION:

Because he mentioned the Swain case?

15

MR. OGLETREE:

Because he mentioned the Swain

16

case, because what he was asking for in this particular

17

case was to restrict the prosecutor's ability to strike

18

black jurors without giving any reasons, and that he

19

should be required to give reasons.

20

the language and his motion, and the court's

21

interpretation of that, that he made a Fourteenth

22

Amendment claim.
QUESTION:

23

And we submit that on

Mr. Ogletree, is it your position

24

that all Swain claims are necessarily Batson claims as

25

well?

Or do you rely on some particular facts specific to

MR. OGLETREE:

issue in this case, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

4
5
6

Well, that has been a central

I just wonder what your position was

on that.
MR. OGLETREE:

The position is that Swain claim

7

— we submit that Swain claims and Batson claims are

8

similar in that Batson, in our interpretation of what this

9

Court did, was to relieve the enormous evidentiary burden

10

that Swain established, and to say if you raise a valid,

11

legitimate --

12

QUESTION:

Well, so your answer to me is you say

13

that Swain ■— all Swain claims necessarily include a

14

Batson claim?

15

MR. OGLETREE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. OGLETREE:

Yes.

In effect.

Okay.

We would submit on this record

18

that it's even more than that.

Even though — (inaudible)

19

a Swain claim had been properly preserved, counsel in this

20

case went beyond that, and in the specific case went on to

21

ask the court to require the prosecutor to give reasons

22

for his peremptory challenges.

23

said his reasons could be based on blue eyes, that there

24

was no reason.

25

hearing was in effect a clear ruling by the judge that

1

there was no basis for him to challenge the way the

2

prosecutor would ultimately use the peremptory challenges.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Ogletree, will you take a look at

4

page 4 of the joint appendix, which has the fourth

5

paragraph, I believe, of the motion that you have been

6

referring to?

7

MR. OGLETREE:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

And it — there it says the exclusion

of members of the black race in the jury when a black

10

accused is being tried will receive ex — or -- et cetera.

11

And then he cites McCray against New York, which is a

12

cert, denied, I think, in our Court —

13

MR. OGLETREE:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

— and Taylor v. Louisiana.

Now,

15

neither of those are in their — by their terms Fourteenth

16

Amendment cases.

17

MR. OGLETREE:

That is correct, Chief — Mr.

18

Chief Justice.

And in fact, if I understand your

19

question, as the case was actually presented for argument

20

in the pretrial motion, counsel renewed his motion, and I

21

think more explicitly, in his language to the court at the

22

pretrial motion said the prosecutor should be required to

23

give reasons for these action strikes.

24

arguing not simply on the basis of Taylor and McCray at

QUESTION:

Where — where did, where did the —

2

where did the petitioner's lawyer in terms use the words

3

Fourteenth Amendment or Equal Protection Clause?

4

MR. OGLETREE:

The counsel did not use those

5

terms explicitly.

6

case was, and these particular facts, the prosecutor

7

having decided to strike all black, potential black

8

jurors, that he should be required to justify on the

9

record those strikes in his case, in this particular case.

13

What he argued for in the particular

QUESTION:

And what, what law did he rely on?

What provision of the Constitution?
MR. OGLETREE:

All he relied on in the pretrial

argument was what was existent then, both Swain --

14

QUESTION:

Did he say Swain?

15

MR. OGLETREE:

He did not, but in fact the

16

prosecutor did.

17

asking for is something under Swain.

18

Swain's burden.

19

expressly says Swain is what he is relying on.

The prosecutor said what counsel is
He hasn't met

In the pretrial motion the prosecutor

QUESTION:

He took it as a Swain — the

prosecutor took it as a Swain claim.
MR. OGLETREE:

Not only the prosecutor, but the

23

court did as well.

The court went on to state his view of

24

how Georgia law had developed, and that prosecutors had

25

given various reasons.

And they didn't have to state a

1

reason.

In fact the court had in effect issue a

2

declaratory statement that in fact the prosecutor has to

3

give no reason in this case.

4

It is also significant that what the trial court

5

did in denying counsel's motion was not to say that he has

6

taken under advisement, or not to say that as a

7

preliminary ruling, but made a firm and flat ruling saying

8

there is nothing that Mr. Ford could do after I deny this

9

pretrial motion to further establish a Swain or Batson

10

claim.

11

was raised, counsel in effect was really arguing the

12

precursor to Batson by asking for application of Batson in

13

his case, and asking the prosecutor to give specific

14

reasons.
QUESTION:

15
16

In fact, it is significant that in 1984, when this

Well, certainly the lower courts all

took the issue up, didn't they?

17

MR. OGLETREE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

In

18

the first supreme court opinion in Georgia, the lower

19

court said that he had not established a Swain claim.

20

said that the fact that he was able to show that 9 out of

21

10 black jurors had been struck was not enough to meet

22

Swain.

23

that underlies Moore v. State is Blackwell v. State, a

Fourteenth Amendment case by the State of Georgia,

specifically on the Swain claim and upholding the

— sort of tangential.

The

prosecutor relies on Swain to point out to the court that

16

the peremptory challenge system goes back to the common

17

law and that it would be an unreasonable burden.

18

— I don't take that one sentence as being an

19

acknowledgement by his, on his part that the motion was

20

based on Swain.

MR. OGLETREE:

I don't

Well, Your Honor, I think it's

clear that both the nature of the motion, the way the

court understood it, the way the Georgia Supreme Court

24

understood it, .the way the prosecutor responded here --

What about the trial court?

The trial court makes that explicit in its

On page 17 of the joint appendix, the

no mention of the Fourteenth there.

MR. OGLETREE:

And there is

That's on page 17.

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

16

if the Court will look at page 11, when the prosecutor in

17

effect cites Swain, the prosecutor goes on and says, in

explaining Swain, and explained this case.

understood it, the defense counsel understood it, and the

2

trial court understood it at the time that it was raised.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Ogletree, at any time in these

4

proceedings, has either any Georgia judge or a Georgia

5

prosecutor taken the position that you waived the claim

6

because you only argued the Sixth Amendment?

7

MR. OGLETREE:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, Your Honor.

No, but this is just brand new up

here.
MR. OGLETREE:

10

That is exactly right, Your

11

Honor.

12

the Georgia Supreme Court, at the time in the new trial

13

motion, that issue was never raised.

14

government concedes in its brief on the direct appeal to

15

the Georgia Supreme Court that Swain was the issue, the

QUESTION:

It was a procedural failure to make a

3

motion at the time they decided that it should have been

4

made.
MR. OGLETREE:

5

That — that's precisely right.

6

I think it's significant to note as well not only do we

7

submit that counsel made an adequate claim, but if you

8

look at what the Georgia Supreme Court did on remand, I

9

think it's particularly telling.

While the Georgia

10

Supreme Court claims that there was an adequate

11

independent State ground and the Government argues that

12

today, it really is an unavailing argument.

13

Georgia Supreme Court says, particularly in Sparks v.

14

United States —Sparks v. State, is three significant

15

points that I hope this Court would focus upon.

16

What the

In Spark — first of all, the Georgia Supreme

17

Court is clear in saying at the time Sparks was decided in

18

1987, that there had been no, and I repeat no, judicial

19

guidelines regarding the time and manner in which a claim

20

is to be presented and preserved under Batson.

21

significant for another reason.

22

clear and says it is perspective.

23

says hereafter any claim under Batson should be raised

24

prior to the time the jurors selected to try the case are

25

sworn.

Sparks is

1

And finally, and most significantly, the Georgia

2

Supreme Court went on to say that Sparks, having failed to

3

comply — Sparks is in a worse position, we submit, than

4

Ford.

5

objection by Sparks did not come until after jury

6

selection, after the jury was sworn, and after evidence

7

was taken.

8

Sparks would receive the benefit of this new rule.

9

Mr. Ford, whose case was tried 30 months before Sparks was

In Sparks there was no pretrial motion.

The first

And yet the Georgia Supreme Court decides that
And

10

decided, whose appeals were perfected 19 months before

11

Sparks was decided, the Supreme Court of Georgia says, has

12

no availing argument.

13

The lack of an adequate and independent state

14

ground, we submit, is another and clear basis for this

15

Court to disagree with the Georgia Supreme Court's ruling.

16

This Court has consistently said that these State

17

procedures must be firmly established and regularly

18

followed.

19

any procedures were established, and it's clear it's the

20

first time that any procedures were followed, and they

21

were not in existence at the time Mr. Ford's case was

22

litigated.

In Sparks it is clear it's the first time that

23

Moreover, in Staub and the Court's most recent

24

pronouncement in Osborne and other cases, this course —

this Court has made clear that defense counsel should not

be forced to engage in an arid ritual, a meaningless

2

forum, and try to preserve these claims when in fact in

3

this case Mr. Ford, given the law that existed, given the

4

uniform appellate procedure in Georgia, and given his

5

understanding of what he had to do, made a claim.

6

had a firm ruling from the trial court in terms of what he

7

could do.

He also had a in-trial colloquy where in that
colloquy the court goes on to say, in fact, that 9 out of

15

Ford v. State the second time around, the dissent, I

16

think, is significant in noting that Mr. Ford, and the

He could not have preserved Batson even if he had objected

Mr. Ogletree, are you implicitly

arguing, this is kind of a follow-up on Justice Kennedy's

sufficient to raise a Batson issue which requires the

MR. OGLETREE:

sufficient to at least raise the issue, and certainly in

I think it's

significant that exactly what Mr. Ford's counsel

you made the same motion and all the rest, but the record

also showed that there were 10 blacks on the panel, and

MR. OGLETREE:

We wouldn't send it back

That's true.

That's true,

Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

11

So I think inevitably we have to be

12

considering whether the fact that the record shows that 9

13

out of 10 eligible jurors were stricken and they are all

14

of the same race, that that at least raises enough for

further inquiry.

MR. OGLETREE:

Right.

And I — it seems to me

17

that the Georgia Supreme Court on both instances does not

deny that that was enough for an inquiry, but said in fact

19

it was the way in which the claim was made, and it wasn't

preserved again after the pretrial motion.

MR. OGLETREE:

It's the most incredible set of

circumstances that not only was it not applied to him, the

The case here today involves the validity of the

the lack of an objection at trial when the conduct giving

the application of the procedural bar in this case does

not constitute an independent and adequate State ground,

his claim by saying at the earliest possible moment when

We submit that the crux of the case is what this

found that petitioner's conduct did not fall in line with

There are

In this particular

case, when this case was presented to the Georgia Supreme
Court, the Georgia Supreme Court clearly concluded that a
proper Swain claim had been made.

At page 51 of the joint

appendix the Georgia Supreme Court and the remand
characterizes the motion as properly made under Swain, and
in fact, at page 55 of the joint appendix, when the
Georgia Supreme Court had the remand, makes clear that
Swain's motion -- that Ford's motion under Swain, having
been decided adversely to him on appeal, cannot be
reviewed in this proceeding.
I think first of all it establishes that Swain
had been made properly.
