ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN BLUME

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BLUME:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

This case involves the question whether, in a

13

capital case, involving pervasive, prejudicial pretrial

14

publicity, which a majority of the potential jurors have

15

been exposed to, may a trial judge prohibit any inquiry

16

whatsoever regarding what the jurors know.

17

In answering that question, the pertinent facts

18

in Mr. Mu'Min's case need to be briefly reviewed.

19

charged in the fall of 1988 with capital murder.

Virginia Department of Corrections.

Mu'Min had confessed to the murder; that a rape was

involved in this crime; the details of his 1973 murder

conviction, including the fact that the death penalty was

not an available punishment due to this Court's decision

in Furman; Mr. Mu'Min's juvenile, criminal, prison and

parole records as well as a number of other bad acts.

They included reports that Mr.

Furthermore, this case became part of the then
national debate about the laxity of the correction system.

10

There were articles which indicated that all public

11

officials associated with this crime should be fired as

well as stories comparing Mr. Mu'Min's offense to a crime

13

committed by the then infamous Willy Horton, and other

14

crimes committed by Virginia prisoners.

15

This case became caught up in the themes of the

16

Bush/Dukakis presidential campaign.

candidates, and public officials, including the prosecutor

counsel requested that certain voir dire questions be

2

asked regarding the content of the information that the

3

potential jurors had been exposed to.

4

however, refused to ask or permit any questions to this

5

effect and only allowed several short questions regarding

whether, in spite of the media accounts, the jurors could

be impartial.

MR. BLUME;

The trial judge,

MR. BLUME:

There is no question that this

is broader.

criminal proceedings.

But nevertheless, the Sixth Amendment right

1

individual sequestered voir dire.

However, I think if the

2

Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury is to

3

mean anything, it must mean that when the publicity, taken

4

as a whole, poses a constitutionally significant risk that

5

the jurors may have been influenced by prejudicial,

6

extraneous information, may have formed an opinion about

7

the case, or be otherwise biased or partial as to guilt,

8

or in a capital case, as to either guilt or the

9

appropriate punishment, and one or more jurors have been

10

exposed to that information, then some reasonable inquiry

11

must be made.

12

I think more concretely in a case such as Mr.

13

Mu'Min's where the publicity contains information which is

14

inadmissible or inaccurate, which is material, and which

15

is likely to mislead or inflame the jury as to guilt or

16

punishment, some inquiry must be permitted as to what the

17

jurors know.

18

has already been adopted by this Court in Irvin, which is

19

that sometimes jurors' assertions of impartiality must be

20

disbelieved.

21

procedural rule than that adopted in Irvin but is

22

nevertheless necessary to its implementation, because

23

under some circumstances, as this Court has acknowledged,

24

pretrial publicity can impinge upon a defendant's right to

25

a fair and impartial jury.

Again, this is a more modest rule than what

It involves a narrower — a narrower

This Court has also acknowledged that a

1
2

defendant's protection against that infringement —• his

3

protection against the effects of negative pretrial

4

publicity is his ability to demonstrate actual juror bias.

5

Without some fair opportunity of finding out in a case

6

such as this what the jurors know, that right simply

7

cannot be honored.

questions?

MR. BLUME:

12

There's certainly no question that

13

any defense lawyer would want to know this for

14

peremptories, but that is not the thrust of the concern.

15

The concern is without this information, the trial judge

16

simply cannot fairly evaluate the jurors' assertions of

impartiality.

position here — it's actually only 4 or 5 that had to do

13

with the media — depends on any one particular question.

14

be asked.

They didn't need to be asked by counsel --

QUESTION:

I know, but the argument — how many

of these questions have to do with the fundamental issue

18

about whether or not a juror might be biased because of

There were 3 or 4, I think, in the

record that he sought to ask which were denied which had

to do with that particular fact.

your mind?

3

MR. BLUME:

Because I think that due to the

4

nature of the prejudicial information, the way pretrial

5

publicity prejudices someone — it's important to

6

understand what they know.

7

for example, that they're not supposed to consider an

individual's prior criminal record.

question, would this affect your decision?

A juror may or may not know,

MR. BLUME:

I'm the Chief Justice.
I'm sorry, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

I think the term individual sequestered voir dire suggests

5

an elaborateness of procedure that is not necessary.

6

There are a number of ways you could have done this and of

7

course that would be free to the States to determine how

8

to implement the constitutional right.

Well, you — you would — you would

Let me give you a way in which we do

Often potential jurors are asked, have you ever

21

been a victim of a crime.

Rather than take everyone out

22

and individually sequester the juror, that person is asked

23

to come to the bench and then the lawyers and the judge

talk briefly at the bench and you find it out.

The point is that this does not lead inevitably

to individual sequestered voir dire.

MR. McLEES:

we submit that this may be indicative that in his mind at

concerns about the impartiality of the jury were not

2

to do that, one of the things that they must do is

in this case.

And in order

The amicus brief suggests that jurors come into
