8

alternatives.
Turning first to the operation and effect of the

9
10

system that prevails in many of the circuits today, that

11

system, with the exception of the three circuits, the

12

Second, Seventh, and Third Circuit, is to apply the law of

facts of the particular case and the particular forum in

Furthermore, as respondents point out and

concede in their brief, State statutes of limitations with

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, these are problems that

8

always exist whenever you borrow State statutes of

9

limitations, but we've been doing it for a couple of

10

hundred years.

11

always better to make up or pick a Federal statute of

12

limitations. Is that always true?

13

I think what you're saying is that it's

MR. OLSON:

Well, it may — it may be from that

14

standpoint generally preferable to pick a Federal uniform

15

statute of limitations for a federally created right.

16

this, the securities laws under Section 10(b), are at the

17

far end of the spectrum, because there must be an

18

interstate nexus to begin with.

5

MR. OLSON:

7

Circuit said this is as enervating as it can possibly be

in the Federal securities field.

The Second Circuit in the Ceres Partners case described

20

one Federal securities case in which 26 different statute

21

of limitations were applied, and another case in which 34

latches generally would be applied in cases involving

2

equity rather than cases for the vindication of private

3

rights of action for damages in the 10(b) context.

4

Doctrines sounding like latches are applied in that the

5

district courts and the States sometimes apply equitable

tolling doctrines, which amount to the same things, to

7

justify whether or not a statute of limitations would

apply in a given case or not.

14

What standard would Congress have preferred.
What happened in 1933 and 1934 when the 1933 and

expressly created five or six separate, specific private

separate or a distinct methodology, which I think, and I

2

respectfully submit, is really the same as looking at

3

legislative intent anyway, but if the Court looks at it

4

differently and applies the analogy standard that is

5

articulated in the Agency Holding v. Malley-Duff case, one

6

draws — comes to the same conclusion.

7

In Blue Chip this Court examined, in order to

8

determine the scope and contours of Section 10(b) with

9

respect to the purchaser and seller requirement, it —

10

this Court looked to the express causes of action in the

11

'33 and '34 act, called them comparable causes of action,

12

said that they were the appropriate vehicle and analogy to

13

compare them with.

14

This Court has repeatedly said that standards of

15

fraud under the common law are light years away from the

16

right created under Section 10(b), and that those

17

comparable causes of action do provide an appropriate

18

analogy because they are Federal, they are intended to be

19

uniform, they are intended to provide private redress for

20

securities fraud, they all arise at the same time.

21

And the other aspect of this from the standpoint

22

of the analogy standard is that if this Court were to

23

adopt a longer period of limitations for Section 10(b), 5

24

years, for example, as the Commission suggests, that would

25

tend to write out, nullify, or repeal the legislation that

the 30 — the 73d Congress specifically focussed on and

2

enacted with respect to these other statutes, because, as

3

this Court has noted, the actions under Section 9 of '34

4

act, Sections 11 and 12 of the '33 act, and so forth, can

5

be brought under Section 10(b).

6

So an artful pleader, if given a choice between

7

a 5-year statute of limitations as the Commission urges,

8

and the 1- and 3-year statute of limitations that Congress

9

expressly adopted, would naturally plead it under Section

10

10(b) to take advantage of the 5-year statute of

11

limitations, thus resulting in a judicial nullification of

12

the express intent of Congress.

I still ask — you can bring a cause of action under that

That's correct.

1

So it wouldn't be at all unusual for

2

that 1988 statute to duplicate the 1- and 3-year statute

that you're arguing for, it already duplicates other ones?

4

MR. OLSON:

That's exact — that's precisely

understood that they might be cutting off the rights of

some plaintiffs when they enacted a statute of limitations

points.

9

Malley-Duff, it is still the norm, it is still the rule

10

for this Court to borrow State statutes of limitations,

11

and there is nothing about the borrowing of State statutes

of limitations which has frustrated or interfered with

Federal policy, and State — and the State statutes from

14

which these statutes of limitations are taken, common law

that this Court should reaffirm ibs holdings in Bailey v.

QUESTION:

4

MR. ALLEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

The third point we want to make is that recent

6

congressional action and inaction in the face of the

7

evolution of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, particularly

8

where Congress has turned its attention to the securities

9

laws on a number of occasions to examine them for

10

problems, that recent inaction and ratification by

11

Congress is of much more significance than the intent of

12

the 73d Congress, an intent which this Court has

13

repeatedly said is only of the most general nature, and an

14

intent which invited the future to fashion remedies that

15

would deal with the evolving nature of securities fraud.

That is what you've said.

similar to the situation that you encountered in the

this after the securities laws.

Congress,

when they enacted the residual statute of limitations in

15

the Judicial Reform Act, Section 313, enacted a 4-year

statute of limitations based upon accrual.

QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, do you — do you take the

5

position that if we were to apply a Federal statute of

limitations and were to apply the l-year/3-year statute of

7

limitations, that there could never be any equitable

8

tolling of that 3-year period?

MR. ALLEN:

10

Is that the position you

I think you -- that that is the

11

position that this Court better figure on, because that

12

statute has been interpreted numerous times — not

13

numerous times, but a number of times, as it applies to

14

the express remedies, and the courts always hold that it

15

is a statute of repose.

And petitioner —

Have we held that?

uniformity at what price?

Of course that problem of jumping

from statute to statute is, I suppose, an argument for Mr.

MR. OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. OLSON:

I'll be very brief.
You'll have to be.

One of the points that respondents

6

make is that there must be a discovery-based statute of

7

limitations in the securities fraud area.

8

concept which Congress debated and rejected.

9

was extensive and Congress rejected it.

That is a
The debate

Congress knew

10

that it was cutting off rights, and it intended to cut off

11

rights, because it balanced the enforcement objectives and

12

the remedial objectives of the '33 and '34 act with the

13

effect of those remedies on the marketplace, and it cut

14

off those rights and it intended it not to be a discovery

15

based limitation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

But your opponent says that those

were not fraud actions.
MR. OLSON:

Well, the problem with what my

19

opponent says with respect to those are not being fraud

20

actions, is that Congress repeatedly characterized those

21

actions as fraud actions.

22

1933 and '34 act contain the word "fraud" literally

23

thousands of times in reference to the express remedies

24

created by those statutes.

them have a greater standard of proof.

2

'34 act does require sienter.

3

with respect to the statutes that Congress created, the

4

remedies that Congress created that the Congress called

5

fraud statutes — some of which had sienter, some of which

6

did not — is that they all had an express statute of

7

limitations, they all had the same statute of limitations,

8

and it cut off the rights at 3 years.

9

Section 9 of the

The one thing in common

The Holmberg case v. Armbrecht dicta is just

10

that.

It's dicta by Justice Frankfurter in an equity

11

case.

As this Court said in American Pipe and

12

Construction v. Utah in 1974, the concept of Federal

13

tolling must be construed to be consistent and consonant

14

with the legislative scheme and the legislative purpose.

15

In this case the legislative scheme and the. legislative

16

purpose are clear.

17

If there is, as this Court said in Touche Ross

18

v. Redington, if there is any injustice as a result of

19

someone's right being cut off, that — if this result, as

20

the Court said, then sanctions injustice, that argument,

21

when made here, is made in the wrong forum.

22

This Court is not at liberty to legislate.

The

23

73d Congress conducted the legislative activities

24

necessary to apply a statute of limitations to the '33 and

25

'34 acts and the Section 10(b) remedy.

in DelCostello, the family resemblance between Section

undeniable.
