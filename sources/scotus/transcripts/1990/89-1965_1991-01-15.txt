ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MANES:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Cottage Savings Association case involves a

12

1980 transaction between Cottage Savings Association and

13

other savings and loan institutions regulated by the

14

Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

15

of numerous other transactions that were done during the

16

same time period throughout the country.

17

This case is representative

This transaction occurred during a very

18

difficult time period for the savings and loan industry.

19

There was a point in time when savings and loans were

caught in a cash squeeze.

2

to attract these funds by giving higher interest rates.

3

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board was not a source of funds

4

because they also were charging high interest rates to the

5

member institutions.

Cottage and other savings and loan institutions were

straddled with low-rate, long-term fixed mortgages.
As a result, their earnings were declining,

On the other side of the coin,

since interest paid on deposits that they were able to

19

Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was to create a transaction

that would cause a loss for tax purposes, and not require

the savings institution to book the loss from a regulatory

standpoint.

QUESTION:

MR. MANES:

17

Did the Home Loan Bank

That's correct.

We did not —

Yes, right.
— get a guarantee from the Federal

Home Loan Bank Board.

QUESTION:

And you could have — you could have

gone to the Internal Revenue Service or to the Treasury

without losing any solvency as far as the regulator was

3

concerned, but they didn't give — guarantee anything

4

beyond that.
MR. MANES:

5
6

That's correct.

But it was an

agency of the Government that was —

7

QUESTION:

Sure, it was.

But it was not an

8

agency of the Government who said you can have a tax

9

benefit.

So the fact that it was an agency of the

10

Government makes no difference.

11

without running afoul of regulatory restrictions, right?

12

MR. MANES:

13

QUESTION:

It said you can do this

That's correct, but —
And they made good on that promise.

14

They didn't pursue you for doing this.

not required to decrease your net worth for regulatory

purposes, right?

MR. MANES:

QUESTION:

20

I mean, you were

That's correct.
So they gave you everything they

promised.
MR. MANES:

But they also had a stated

objective, and the stated objective of R-49, as the

22

Government recognizes, was to prepare the transaction that

23

would produce the loss.

You could have gotten a letter from
You were

We were rolling the dice, so to

That you were free to roll the dice.

That's all they told you.

MR. MANES:

I'll accept that statement.
Let me follow through on that.

Home Loan Bank Board was concerned?

MR. MANES:

The accounting effect is that R-49

That's correct.

And therefore it wouldn't have any

That's correct, from a tax

That's correct.
Well, Mr. —
From accounting regulatory

standpoint.
QUESTION:

23

Mr. Manes, don't we really have to

look at the Code provisions to see if there's a tax loss

or not?

Do you plan to talk about that?

Yes, I do.

The -- that's a point in

Now, is this an exchange or a sale, do you

That's correct.
Okay.
That's correct.

That's not an

issue.
QUESTION:

All right.

And there may have to be

a material difference, however, if we apply the Treasury

regulation?

23

MR. MANES:

Yes.

And that's one of the

questions here, is to the effect of the Treasury

1

The transaction was challenged by the Internal

2

Revenue Service, and the basis of the challenge from the

3

Internal Revenue Service was the regulation that you're

4

referring to.

5

property that Cottage exchanged was not materially

6

different than the property that it had received.

7

The basis of the challenge is that the

Our position is that we're really talking about

8

some basic tax concepts here, and these concepts are

9

elementary in the tax law.

And the concepts are of

10

realization and recognition.

11

is a all-encompassing type of test.

12

section 1001 states that you compute gain or loss by

taking the amount realized and subtracting from that the

adjusted basis.

MR. MANES:

The Code itself, in

And the test for realization

That's (a), correct?
That's correct.

The Code then goes further and states that these

realized gains or losses are to be recognized unless

21

there's an exception in subtitle (a) of the Internal

22

Revenue Code.

23

section 1001(a), and Congress has been clear here in the

24

exceptions to the recognition rules, which is the second

test here to determine if a loss is to be realized,

And Congress has been pretty clear here in

sorry, excuse me — a nonstatutory wash sale rule when

example, the situation of exchanging bushels of wheat if

the price of wheat drops, and they argue that that would

QUESTION:

You say the regulation then is

unauthorized by the statutes?

3

MR. MANES:

No, I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice. I

4

think the regulation, for what it says, which is a

5

statement that if you meet the material difference

6

requirement, then there is realization.

7

doesn't say the converse, that if you don't meet it there

8

is not realization.

9

QUESTION:

And it really

And I think that's a —
If one were to imply the converse

10

from the regulation, would you say the converse

11

implication was not authorized by the statute?

12

MR. MANES:

It's not authorized by the statute

14

QUESTION:

15

you lose your case.

16

MR. MANES:

If you don't say that it seems to me

It's not authorized by the statute,

17

and it doesn't follow the Supreme Court cases that that

18

regulation was really founded upon.

19

Court cases were very hair-trigger type tests as to what

20

is material difference.

21

QUESTION:

And those Supreme

Well, but then you're saying the

regulation could be valid, but that the IRS is

interpreting it incorrectly.

constitutional distinction.
MR. MANES:

3

I agree that the regulation -- I'm

not challenging the validity, per se, of the regulation.

5

The regulation is there.

6

the early cases that the Government argued a hair-trigger

7

type test for realization, and the early cases really

8

muddied the issue because they kind of combined

9

realization and recognition.

10

But the regulation is based upon

And the later portion of it,

especially the Code itself, separates these,.
QUESTION:

11

But there's language in some of this

12

Court's opinions that there has to be — to the effect

13

that there has to be a material difference, and perhaps

14

the IRS was trying to codify that language, in effect,

15

with its regulation.

16

MR. MANES:

That regulation was based upon the

17

case law at the time, which talked about having something

18

materially different.

19

the Government was arguing for a hair-trigger, broad-line

20

approach.

21

QUESTION:

And it was based upon cases where

I don't know what you mean by that.

22

But do you — do you take the position that today in the

23

recognize a tax gain or loss?

first under realization, or realization would be —

2

QUESTION:

Yes or no?

Under today's law do you

3

take the view that an exchange of bushels of wheat should

4

result in a taxable gain or loss?

5

MR. MANES:

I would answer that as yes.

And the

6

answer is based upon a finding of realization, and also

7

you then would have to look to see if there is an

8

exception to the recognition portion.

9

Congress legislated.

And that's where Congress has taken

10

into account material differences.

11

are really a test of recognition.

13

QUESTION:

And that's where

Material differences

Is that consistent with Eisner v.

Macomber?

14

MR. MANES:

Yes.

Because Eisner dealt with

15

whether or not just depreciation itself, or just

16

depreciation in the asset, whether or not that —

QUESTION:. Well, I thought that there was an

event.

not?

20

There was an event of a stock dividend, was there

Well, it's questionable whether that

itself was an event, whether a stock dividend would be a

And the only reason that it, it was

Suppose we disagree with you and

think that the deference we owe to the regulation means

that we will apply it?

QUESTION:

I take it the court of appeals agreed

with you on 1001?
MR. MANES:

That would be a fair interpretation

of the Sixth Circuit.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MANES:

And they turned you down on 165?
Yeah, which the Government is now

10

saying is a portion of the material different argument.

11

It's a — they're not really arguing it, like the Sixth

12

Circuit did, that it's a separate test.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

So for you to win you have to say the

court of appeals was wrong on 165?
MR. MANES:

Or we could say that the Government,

16

and their position is that it's a material difference

17

test, and it's still satisfied in material difference.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I would suppose we wouldn't

19

decide that.

We would say that the court of appeals was

20

wrong on (a)165 and wrong on 1001 and remand to see if in

21

this particular transaction there was a material

22

difference.

you would get the same answer.

So you would — if -- if the — if we

would say the regulation is valid, you would then go to

MR. MANES:

QUESTION:

Is it because all mortgages are

If they're identical, there is —

the differences are.

QUESTION:

It seems to me they're a lot more

alike than what you've got here.

18

MR. ROBERTS:

No, if you're trading bonds on the

market, the first thing you're going to ask, of course, is

20

whose bond is it and what's the interest rate.

change in interest rate is going to be different.

Yes, you changed the interest rate on

What about exchanges of shares

MR. ROBERTS:

The person

Well, but there again it's sort of

like the mutual fund example.

The differences in the

management, how they're going to trade the bonds is

11

something that would be a material difference.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I think though, we're -- again

13

we're right back to the fact that there are differences in

14

the homeowners who are going to pay or not pay the loans,

15

there are differences in the banks who are not -- are or

are not going to collect promptly.

distinction lies.

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't see where the

Well, the distinction is partly in

19

the market.

I mean, we're familiar with how important who

20

the borrower is and what the collateral is when you take

21

out a mortgage on your home.

these mortgage loans doesn't work that way.

These

other differences did not make a difference to the market,

did not make a difference to the parties acting in that

market, and did not make a difference to the bank board.
The swap pools of mortgages loans were therefore

not materially different under the Treasury regulation as

interpreted by the Commissioner, and therefore did not

result in a realized loss.
QUESTION:

9

Yeah, but in my example the

differences in the bonds in the two funds didn't make any

difference to the fair market value of the share of stock

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not just the value, it's the

factors that went into determining value.

purpose of Memorandum R-49 was to make sure that the

factors that went into determining value were matched up

MR. MANES:

Whether or not they were located in different States.

these were objective criteria.

and recognized from a financial accounting standpoint.

And, you know, that is, you know, consistent to the tax

laws .

6

Realization should only require two things.

7

One, has there been an increase or decrease in value of

the asset involved from the basis which you hold it, and

9

two, whether or not there has been a sale or disposition.

QUESTION:

MR. MANES:

12

QUESTION:

Excuse me -And from there —
Could I — for regular accounting

purposes, you would have to revalue these mortgages even

if you didn't engage in a swap, isn't that right?

That would be correct.

And then after a realization is
