QUESTION:

Excuse me there.

It has been

proposed by several respected organizations, such as the

American Bar Association, I gather, and the American Law

10

Institute.
MR. MEYER:

11

The American Law Institute and the

12

American Bar Association have adopted — taking the

13

American Law Institute, which has been a little more

14

active in the area, a — what they call a tentative draft,

15

which is, I think they are now up to tentative draft

16

number 10, which suggests what is called the universal

demand requirement.

case, and that this will obviate the difficulty of

19

determining whether or not the demand is in fact futile.

20

It will compel a demand.

line with the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit which cites

22

at some length the tentative draft of the American Law

Institute.

here, also say that the business judgment rule would not

be applied to the determination of the directors?

3

MR. MEYER:

The — no, I don't believe they say

4

that.

On the contrary, the basic rationale followed by

5

the court of appeals in this case is that the introduction

6

of a universal demand requirement is suggested by the

7

recent developments in the growth of special litigation

8

committees.

of directors is directly implicated in the wrong, the

Even where, as in the present case, the board

10

court below says the board can create a special litigation

11

committee by — perhaps by expanding its number, bringing

12

in people who were not involved in the wrongdoing.

13

committees supposedly will dispassionately review the

14

facts of the matter, make a recommendation to the board of

15

directors, and the board will act accordingly.

Well, it may or may not be.

Let's

assume it is a recommendation not to go forward.

7

MR. MEYER:

All right.

The question then

becomes one of reviewing the determination of the special

litigation committee, and the focus of the litigation has

now changed.

The plaintiff has a

Well, could you answer my question?

I asked you to compare two burdens.
MR. MEYER:

9

Yes.

The burden of reviewing — the

10

burden that the plaintiff has where a demand is made and

11

turned down is virtually insuperable.

So the futility exception really

gives the plaintiff a leg up, then.

turned down?
MR. MEYER:

It allows it to

That's correct, and

by this Court for well over 100 years and by every court

that has ever passed upon the question.

But Mr. Meyer, excuse me.

I thought

21

the Seventh Circuit had explicitly repudiated imposing

22

upon the disappointed would-be plaintiff that kind of a

burden.

24

in exchange for always requiring a request to be made we

25

will not impose the normal business judgment rule.

After all, why go to the trouble of forming a

the recommendations of special litigation.

undoubtedly having some effect on corporate governments,

are really directed toward corporate litigation and not

The third point that I want to talk to, and I

would like to address this as briefly as possible because

I do want to reserve, if permitted, some time for

The third point I want to address is what law

applies to the case.

apply to the case, in this case Maryland law, unless that

13

State law is so inconsistent with the enforcement of the

14

important Federal public policies underlying the proxy

rules, in this case section 20 of the Investment Company

16

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

18
19

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Prior to the decision below it was the law in

20

virtually all jurisdictions that shareholders need not

21

make demand before commencing a derivative action where

22

that demand would be futile.

23

appeals abolished the traditional futility exception and

24

replaced it with a rule that requires universal demand in

25

every case.

In our view, the court of appeals erred in

2

addressing this question as one of Federal common law for

the courts of appeals to decide as they perceive the

policy balances to require.

Rather, State law should

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, that's a little odd,

8

isn't it, because this is an action brought under a

9

Federal statute?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

A Federal cause of action.

And the

12

cases saying that you nevertheless look to State law are a

13

little unusual, it seems to me.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

requirements.
MR. DREEBEN:

2

Well, there are two responses I'd

3

like to give to that.

First of all, the question of

4

whether demand is required or not is a Federal question

5

because the cause of action arises under a Federal

6

statute.

7

from what source does Federal law derive the rule of

8

decision.

9

when a question is governed by Federal law, Federal law

There is no doubt about that.

The next issue is

This Court has in many contexts held that even

10

may turn to State law rather than fashioning an entire

11

body of law on its own.

12

the outstanding example of this, and the Court applied a

13

very similar principle in Burks v. Lasker when it comes to

14

the law of corporations.

15

created under State law.

16

I think the Kimbell Foods case is

Corporations, after all, are

When Congress regulated in the Investment

17

Company Act, as it did in the other securities acts to

18

regulate corporate activities, it did not provide for

19

Federal chartering of corporations.

20

to charter corporations and to basically regulate the

21

activities of corporations subject only to the predominant

22

Federal policy.

Otherwise State law governs.

25

It relied on States

So Federal law displaces State law to the

QUESTION:

What if the State law says that there

1

will be a demand made in every case?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

That — in our view the initial

3

step for a court to follow is to adopt that rule, and then

4

to consider whether it infringes any Federal policy to

5

follow it.

6

since we don't have a State that provided for universal

7

demand, although there are several.

e

way to answer whether it conforms to Federal policy is to

9

look at what happens after demand is made.

10

That question, of course, isn't here today,

I think that the real

Does that — does the making of demand in a

11

particular State give the corporation a leg-up in

dismissing the derivative action?

And how do you read the Seventh

Circuit's holding about — insofar as that is concerned?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the Seventh Circuit thought

21

it could achieve a nice distinction, a very logical, tidy

22

distinction between a Federal rule of universal demand and

23

State law governing what happens after demand is made.

24

The problem with that approach is, although it sounds nice

25

in theory, in fact it doesn't work.

The reason it doesn't

work is because many States place an integral connection
between whether a shareholder has to make demand and what
standard of review is subsequently applied to the board of
directors' decision.
So Delaware, for example, which is a leading
State in corporate law, says that if a demand is required
of the shareholder and not excused, then the directors'
subsequent decision not to sue is judged very
deferentially under the business judgment rule.

On the

other hand, if demand is futile because the board is
either biased or too implicated in the transaction to act
on it, then a much higher standard of review applies when
the corporation attempts to terminate the suit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, I understood the Seventh

Circuit to avoid that problem by federalizing the latter
question as well, that is by saying how much deference you
give to the board decision is also a Federal question, and
we will not adopt as a matter of Federal law the business
judgment rule.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I am not sure that the court

said exactly either of those things.

If it said -- if it

thought it was saying that it's a Federal question what
standard of review applies to the board of directors'
decision, then in effect it overruled Burks v. Lasker,
because Burks v. Lasker held that the power of corporate

I don't think that the court of appeals actually

is that we can have a Federal rule, which it thought was

MR. DREEBEN:

It would simplify things if there

were a coherent way of applying it, and the way of

applying it were consistent with Federal law.

16

that many States regulate derivative actions is that if

to adopt a very straightforward rule that in every

derivative case the shareholder must make a demand before

proceeding to the Federal court.

said nothing about what the standard of review should be.

It is an issue relating to demand, and as
