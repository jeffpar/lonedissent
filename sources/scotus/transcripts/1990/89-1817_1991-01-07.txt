ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. COATES:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This case arises from a class action lawsuit filed

12

by prisoners in the Riverside County Jail against the County

13

of

14

determination that the County of Riverside fails to provide

15

warrantless arrestees with a probable cause determination

16

promptly after arrest, as required by the Fourth Amendment

17

as interpreted by this Court in Gerstein v. Pugh.

That's just a ridiculous way to read

the complaint.

MR. COATES:

I'll tell you,

I believe that the

language of the complaint does support that interpretation,

fact

MR. COATES:

I mean, you're

I can only, as I mentioned, reiterate

20

the argument that we have made below, that if — I think if

21

you hold them to the four-square language of the complaint,

22

there is then no offer to amend at any time, that it shows

23

that these people not necessarily suffer the deprivation of

24

which they are complaining.

the Court, looking at Gerstein, was talking of the question

of mootness of that point.

of standing.

There is no extended discussion

But —

QUESTION:

Well, just so I understand your point,

5

suppose a person has been held for 10 days and files a

6

complaint and says I have not been given a prompt hearing.

7

Is it your position is that, well, a prompt hearing would

8

be 4 or 5 days, so there is nothing we can do for you?
MR. COATES:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

He would be able to —
I mean,

is that your reading of the

complaint?
MR. COATES:

12

Gerstein requires a hearing.

And if

13

you haven't given him a hearing, at the very least he has

14

the right to request a hearing, if he is still in custody.
