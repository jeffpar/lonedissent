ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOAN MARIE FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. FISHER:

Ms.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I represent the petitioner, Bryan Stuart

10
11

Lankford.

12

September 20,

13

was as cocounsel pursuant to a pro se motion to dismiss

14

his trial counsel, Bryan Lankford stood convicted of two

15

counts of first degree murder due to his participation in

16

a robbery which resulted in two homicides.

17

to my appointment, namely September 13,

18

Idaho, through the prosecuting attorney, had writ — had

19

filed pursuant to a court order a written affirmative

20

pleading that it was not seeking the death penalty.

21

Following the — my appointment, Bryan -- and because of

22

the notice filed by the State, Bryan Lankford faced a

23

maximum penalty at sentencing of life without the

24

possibility of parole.

25

I have represented Bryan Lankford since
1984.

QUESTION:

At the time of my appointment, which

One week prior

1984, the State of

Ms. Fisher, you say, you intimate

1

that if the prosecution doesn't seek the death penalty

2

under Idaho law, then the death penalty cannot be imposed

3

under Idaho law.

4

law?

5

Is that a correct statement of Idaho

MS. FISHER:

That is not a correct statement of

6

Idaho law, especially in light of this case.

7

had never occurred before that the State had affirmatively

8

pled a, or taken the death penalty out of the sentencing

9

proceeding, and the court had imposed the death penalty.

10

QUESTION:

However, it

Why would the death penalty — there

11

is an Idaho case that neither side cites, by the way,

12

called State v. Rossi, which didn't involve the death

13

penalty, but it involved a case in which the judge imposed

14

a sentence double that that the State had recommended.

15

And it was appealed on the same grounds that you are using

16

today to the Idaho Supreme Court, and the Idaho Supreme

17

Court said, we hold that a trial court is not bound by a

18

sentence recommendation made by the State, even though

19

that recommendation was offered in conjunction with a

20

negotiated plea.

21

the death penalty?

22

Why, why would it be any different for

MS. FISHER:

The major difference, of course, or

23

the critical difference, is that this is a death penalty

24

case in which we —

25

QUESTION:

Well, why is that critical?

I

mean —
MS. FISHER:

We go beyond a mere recommendation

of sentence into an affirmative pleading that they're not
seeking the death penalty.

Obviously, capital cases or

capital sentencing proceedings under Idaho law are
significantly different than noncapital sentencing
proceedings.
QUESTION:

Not insofar as whether you're bound

by the recommendation of the prosecution is concerned.

I

mean, I can understand thinking in some newly created
judicial system that whatever the State recommends is the
maximum you could get, but you know in Idaho that that's
not the case.

This case, Idaho Supreme Court case was

before this litigation.
MS. FISHER:

Well, State v. Rossi, if it was

before the litigation, there's two things.

Number one, if

it was entered in accordance to a plea agreement, so he
entered a plea of guilty, obviously the court at that time
advised the defendant they were not, that he was not bound
by the State's recommendation.

In this case the court

not they were seeking the death penalty, and if they were
seeking the death penalty to state the specific statutory
aggravating factors upon which it relied, was an
affirmative notice order leading the def — leaving no

1

reason for the court to have ordered that notice unless

2

the State could have, unless the defense could have relied

3

on it.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose what the court had said was,

5

in a third paragraph of that order, and in the event the

6

state does not educe further evidence of aggravating

7

factors, the court will, on its own motion, weigh the

8

aggravating factors disclosed at trial and determine

9

whether or not the death penalty is appropriate.

10
11

12

13

Could

the court have done that?
MS. FISHER:

The court could have done that.

Had the court done that I would have been -QUESTION:

So then it's not the question of

14

whether or not the State can in effect waive the death

15

penalty, it's a question of whether or not you had notice.

16

Isn't that true?

17

MS. FISHER:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.
And — in that respect I'm concerned

19

that, unless I misread the record, you indicate nothing in

20

your briefs and nothing in the trial court to indicate

21

that you would have done anything any differently, nor did

22

you express any surprise or make any objection when the

23

penalty was imposed, but correct me if I'm wrong.

1

would have been done differently had I known it was a

2

capital proceeding.

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, has there been any showing of

that in this record?
MS. FISHER:

Your Honor, there has always been

6

argument that I would have treated the case differently

7

because, because there were a number of things that would

8

be relevant, a certain amount of evidence that could have

9

been marshaled in argument that went directly to the

10

aggravating factors, but I didn't know that the

11

aggravating factors were at issue.

12

QUESTION:

Well, you knew those aggravating

13

factors were at issue with reference to the length of the

14

prison sentence.

15

that was important in mitigation you would have brought it

16

up in connection with the, the sen — the hearing on the

17

length of the prison sentence.

18

I would assume that if you had something

MS. FISHER:

There are a number of items that I

19

would have done had I known it was a capital sentencing

20

that I would not have done, and did not do because it was

21

a noncapital sentencing.

22

have organized my time, my research, and my energies

23

towards the sentencing proceeding and not gone into the

24

motion for new trial.

25

I would have developed the forensic evidence at trial.

For instance, I certainly would

I would have listened to the tapes.

would have called the polygrapher who would not have,

whose testimony would not have been admissible in a

noncapital case, but certainly would have been admissible

under the mitigating circumstances in a capital case -QUESTION:

5

Well, you're telling us that now, I'm

6

not sure that it's an appropriate argument for us to take

7

into account when you did not make that submission at any

8

point below or in your briefs.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Fisher, this was a capital case.

QUESTION:

Justice Kennedy asked her a question,

10

I mean —

11
12

I think.
MS. FISHER:

13

I -- we have always argued that

14

there were things that I would have done -- and I have

15

always argued that there were things that I would have

16

done had I known it was a capital case.

17

postconviction hearing, which was the first available time

18

which I could raise the issue of notice, I said I wouldn't

19

have done it this way as a result — I would have

20

addressed, I would have developed the evidence in

21

conjunction with the statutory aggravating circumstances

at trial.

this is —

QUESTION:

does it show that you have advised the trial court of

you wish.

Well, you can return to it later if

I think it's an important point.
MS. FISHER:

10

The argument has been made,

11

certainly, as to specific things that I would have done

12

differently, they have been argued — it has not been

13

argued.

14

one has ever asked.

15

did in fact refer to specific things that would have been

done differently.

QUESTION:

11

But your objection would have, would

12

have been just as valid whether it was a capital, whether

13

you knew the death sentence was going to be imposed or

14

not, wouldn't it?
MS. FISHER:

15

Well, the issue, the issues to

16

which the polygraph had been, had been given were

17

specifically in reference to those issues that arise under

18

the statutory aggravating factors.

19

QUESTION:

But — but aren't those aggravating

20

factors relevant to the length of the prison sentence as

well?

22

MS. FISHER:

They are relevant.

1

not admissible.

Had I known it was a capital sentencing,

2

I would not have agreed to that interpretation of the law

3

because of the broad rulings that this Court has given in

4

that all mitigation evidence can come before the trial

5

court in a capital sentencing hearing.
QUESTION:

6

And you think we would not have

7

applied that rule simply because the State here had said

8

that it was not going to, going to seek the death penalty?
MS. FISHER:

9

That's correct.

Certainly

10

polygraphs have been held inadmissible in other, in

11

noncapital sentencings.

12

or what the defendant was deprived of in this case was the

13

ability to argue against the appropriateness of the death

penalty.

16

amount of effort to advise the defendant of the matters at

risk.

19

counsel, the first one where I was appointed as cocounsel,

21

stage.

22

In, on March 10 when we had the hearing to dismiss the

23

trial counsel, the trial judge goes into significant

24

lengthy colloquy with the defendant to advise him of the

25

risk because I had not read the record, because I had not

aware of everything that had taken place.

3

advise the defendant, and what he doesn't advise me, is

4

that the significant risk here is that he is facing the

5

death penalty.

6

QUESTION:

What he doesn't

At the conclusion of the sentencing

7

hearing, Ms. Fisher, the judge did say that one possible

8

upshot of it would be the death penalty, did he not?

9

MS. FISHER:

At the conclusion, after all of the

10

evidence, all of the argument and evidence was heard in

11

the sentencing, there is a reference by the trial judge to

12

"or death."

13

taken in the context of the affirmative notice otherwise,

14

that comment was not regarded as a statement that he in

15

fact was considering the death penalty, but rather as a

16

statement to the prosecution that these had been my

17

options, and you come in here and recommend the minimum.

18

But in hindsight, and looking at the cold record --

19

Taken in the context of those proceedings and

QUESTION:

Don't you think that had you to do it

20

again, and perhaps any lawyer exercising a reasonable

21

judgment in that situation, when the judge said that, it

22

would have alerted them if they hadn't been alerted

23

before?

24
25

MS. FISHER:

No question that if I had to do it

again, I, it would have alerted me.

Whether or not it was

1

reasonable at that time, I believe in the context of the

2

proceedings and the fact that we had gone 3 weeks without

3

ever mentioning the death penalty -- there are two times

4

prior in the sentencing proceeding where the words "or

5

death" would have had a significant impact, would

6

certainly have alerted me.

7

and says well, as the court required, we filed the formal

8

pleading waiving the death penalty — he doesn't say

specifically waiving, but saying that we weren't seeking

When the prosecutor stands up

10

the death penalty, so what are the options left,

11

indeterminate life or determinate life.

12

interjected there "or death," that would have alerted me.

13

Had, when I stood up and said to the trial judge, the

14

question that I have to argue here is whether or not this

15

court should impose an indeterminate life or a determinate

16

life on the defendant, had the judge interjected the words

17

"or death," that certainly would have alerted me.

Had the judge

Well, sometimes counsel don't want to

They want to get the judge thinking in another direction.

1

decision.

2

tactical decision to focus on the determinate sentences

3

simply in order to put the judge's mind in that frame.

4

So you could interpret this record as a

MS. FISHER:

Well, there is no question that at

5

trial counsel where they received affirmative notice from

6

the State that they're not seeking death is in a dilemma

7

as to whether or not argue against, set up argument as to

8

the potential of the death penalty.

9

now is in Idaho because of this case, trial counsel are in

10

that dilemma.

11

that the death penalty was at issue.

13

At the time there was no reason to believe

QUESTION:

12

And as the case law

You say there was no reason — under

Idaho law there was no reason to believe it was at issue?

14

MS. FISHER:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Why was that?

Do you have any case

16

that even suggests that what the prosecutor asks is the

17

upper limit?

18

MS. FISHER:

There has to be -- there has to be

19

a distinction between a recommendation — I obviously knew

20

that the court was not bound by the recommendation of the

21

State.

22

What Idaho had so far was Osborn 1.

23

a case where the defendant has no, has had informal notice

24

of the aggra — evidence in aggravation and argument to be

25

had, in a case where he has been present at all the prior

The State recommended the minimum of 10 years.
Osborn 1 said that in

1

proceedings, in a case where the trial court has advised

2

him at the time of his plea of the potential of the death

3

penalty, then the requirement of a formal notice that the

4

state is seeking the death penalty is not required.

5

Osborn 2 — or, Gibson then comes down in 1983

6

and refers to this mandatory procedure, and includes the

7

notice that the State is seeking the death penalty.

8

Osborn 2 then comes down and says in a noncapital

9

sentencing case, even though clearly Osborn was a first

10

degree murder conviction where the State, I mean where the

11

court imposed life, they said in a noncapital sentencing,

12

Idaho Code 2515(d), which is the necessity of inquiry

13

under the death penalty statute, doesn't apply.

14

wasn't any reason to believe, in 1984, that if the State

15

didn't seek the death penalty, that the court would impose

16

it sui sponte without any comment as to the possibility or

17

to the fact that he was in fact considering that option.

18

QUESTION:

So there

Well, there might not have been a

19

reason to think that a judge would normally do that, but

20

you think there was no reason to think that it could be

21

done in law?

22

reasonably believe the chances were 99 to 1 that the judge

23

would, of course, if the State wasn't seeking death, not

24

impose death.

25

matter of law that the judge could not do it?

I mean, I understand how you could

But you're saying that you thought as a

Is that

1

what you're saying?

2

MS. FISHER:

Well, certainly -- you know, my

3

thoughts are not in the record, but I never contemplated

4

the possibility that the judge could in fact impose the

5

death penalty at --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. FISHER:

8

QUESTION:

9

The legal possibility.
That's correct.
Did Osborn 2 advert specifically to

Gibson?
MS. FISHER:

10

No, it did not.

Gibson -- and the

11

reference in Gibson is simply a, an outline of the

12

capital, the mandatory capital procedure.

13

Osborn were not interrelated in any way.

14
15

QUESTION:

Gibson and

I take it that outline was not the

holding of the case in Gibson, however?

16

MS. FISHER:

Well, they had a number of holdings

17

because there were a number of issues.

18

that the issue was notice in Gibson.

19

QUESTION:

I don't believe

Ms. Fisher, when was the first time

20

that the judge made it known that death was still in the

21

case?

22

the first time?

23

You have mentioned before that he did it; was that

MS. FISHER:

Assuming that you accept the

24

reference at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing as

25

such notice, that would have been the first time.

As

1

taken in the context of proceedings, the first time that

2

the judge made it known was when he actually imposed the

3

death penalty, and that was on October 15, 1984.

4

In this case there is more than a lack of

5

notice.

Assuming that the constructive notice of the

6

statutory requirement, or statutory sentencing, was in

7

fact constructive notice, once the trial court exercised

8

its discretion, which it clearly had under Idaho

9

sentencing law, to notify, or to order notice in regard to

10

15

GEN. ECHOHAWK:

Well, Your Honor, I think it's

important to recognize that the, the order that the court

Upon the

But I think that, this is not in the Joint

8

Appendix, but I think that the Court ought to look very

9

carefully at the record in the supreme court, the

10

transcript from the April 5 proceeding, because in that

11

proceeding the court makes this statement after there is

12

some discussion about and recognition that notification by

13

the State is not required as to its position.

goes on to say, there obviously needs to be inquiry

pursuant to 19-2515 as to the statutory aggravating

circumstances that may exist, regardless of whether or not

the State intends to pursue the death penalty.

18

the court made it pretty clear in that statement that yes,

19

we're going to identify what the prosecutor's position is,

If she really thought that it was a surprise, believe me,

And I believe

1

that the way that the Idaho sentencing laws for capital

2

offenses are structured, the judge is placed in a position

3

to make that decision to avoid inconsistencies.

4

allow a prosecutor to bind the judge is a way that will

probably lead to more inconsistencies in terms of what is

handed down.

found, have to be weighed with the mitigating

QUESTION:

But just to be clear on the point,

14

what you, what you are saying in effect is that when the

referring to a case in which at any time capital

sentencing was a possibility.

I'm just going

1

back to the, to the colloquy that you and I, and Justice

2

Scalia and I have had about the language from Gibson.

3

I just want to get clear on this that when Gibson refers

4

to a potential death penalty case, you in effect are

telling us that what Gibson is referring to is a case in

might indeed be a possibility.

that at no time has the defendant in this case made any

factual representation about what evidence would be

QUESTION:

that today.

She said that she would have argued that even

though polygraph at testimony is not admissible in a

21

normal trial or a normal sentencing hearing, she would

22

have argued in view of our Lockett case and the

requirement of all mitigating circumstances being

admissible, she would have argued that under that rule it

25

was admissible.

She might not have prevailed, but she

said she would have made that argument.

2

GEN. ECHOHAWK:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

3

polygraph evidence would have presented an issue for the

4

trial court to consider, but the fact is that she did not

5

offer that proof.
QUESTION:

6

Well, right.

And she said the reason

7

she didn't do it is because she thought it was

8

inadmissible because she didn't think it was a death case.

9

Whereas she would have made the different argument had she

10

realized it was a death case.

GEN. ECHOHAWK:

11

Your Honor, I understand that

12

the petitioner's argument is that once the prosecutor made

the recommendation, that it became a nondeath case, that

14

the prosecutor could bind the court unless the court came

15

out and made some specific statement that I'm going to

Yes.

of death, does the defendant ordinarily, is the defendant

Yes, Your Honor, in all cases,

the statute.

14

And that's essentially what our position is,

that in reading the statute for first degree murder and

the punishment provisions, it's very clear that death was
