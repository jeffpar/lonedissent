CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Ker, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON R. KER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. KER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue of whether or not 2000e-16(c) is a

12

jurisdictional requirement upon title VII Federal Employee

13

Claimants can be addressed with — from four bases, the

14

first one being that of the plain meaning of the statute,

15
16

the second being legislative intent, third being from the
%
case law itself and from — the fourth being Bowen v. the

17

City of New York as what petitioner asserts as being

18

squarely in point here.

19

Looking to the plain meaning of the statute this

20

has been a broad waiver of immunity and there — within in

21

the statute itself is no clear jurisdictional language.

22

There is not the language of no action may be commenced or

23

actions are prohibited such as was the case in the

24

Hallstrom v. Tillamook case.

25

With that in mind, this Court in Bowen,

addressing the argument of whether or not 405(g) was a

2

jurisdictional requisite cited that the traditional

3

meaning of words applies.

4

United States, 110 Supreme Court 2143, looked at the

5

generic or contemporary meaning of words.

6

meaning of words as being used as in INS v. Cardoza-

7

Fonseca.

8

Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE you look at the

9

common usage of words being used.

10

In that respect, Taylor v. the

The ordinary

And then again the language from this Court in

With that backdrop we submit that the

11

traditional view of filing periods is that they are

12

subject to equitable tolling.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ker, now — excuse me, let

14

me get my microphone on — it seems to me that the Court

15

in a number of cases has adopted a rule of strict

16

construction where the Government itself has given up its

17

sovereign immunity and permitted suit against itself.

18

Just last term we had a case, U.S. v. Dalm.

19

you cited —

20

MR. KER:

21

QUESTION:

I don't think

I did not cite Dalm.
But again it relied on the sovereign

22

immunity principle to construe a statute worded like this

23

one as not providing equitable tolling relief.

24

you reconcile those cases?

25

MR. KER:

Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

So how do

With

respect to the Dalm case, I did not cite that one, and to

2

be perfectly honest with Your Honor, I don't know the

3

facts of that case.

4

attention to again the Bowen case, but also the Hallstrom

5

v. Tillamook case.

6

petitioner here.

7

However, I would address your

Both of those cases support the

In Bowen the Court, looking at the sovereign

8

immunity argument, stated that the Court adopts the strict

9

construction requirement where there has been a waiver of

10

sovereign immunity.

But went on to state that under --

11

even though we look at it in a strict sense, they're not

12

to look too narrowly where the congressional intent is

13

clear that it wasn't to be construed narrowly.

14

in Bowen and I can — also in Hallstrom, Your Honor, it's

15

stated concerning that particular provision — and that

16

upheld the Government's side in that case — but in

17

Hallstrom we were looking at a different type of situation

18

where the statute itself provided for the action that was

19

not taken and it was distinguishable from Bowen.

That again

And I -

20
21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KER:

23

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Ker —
Yes.
— I thought in Bowen the Court said

24

there was language by which Congress had expressed its

25

clear intention to allow tolling in some cases.

Now,

1

that's distinguishable here.

2

There's just a language that says you'll sue within 30

3

days.

4

MR. KER:

There is no such language.

Yes, Your Honor, but the provision in

5

Bowen was similar to this one by the use of the word may.

6

The statute itself, looking at the language within the

7

statute, talks about the claimant may file a suit within

8

30 days.
QUESTION:

9

Well, maybe the Court hasn't been

10

entirely consistent in its cases, but I do suggest that

11

when you look at cases like Mottaz and Soriano and the

12

case last term, U.S. v. Dalm, they just aren't consistent

13

with your theory.

14

but it seems to me there's some tension there and we may

15

have to work it out.

16

MR. KER:

Now, I don't know where we ought to be,

Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

I would

17

submit that where we ought to be is, following the overall

18

objectives of title VII being to literally construe that

19

statute to protect the intended class.

20

in mind

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KER:

24

you cite that in your brief?

1

QUESTION:

2

title VII as I recall, and nonetheless the Court said that

3

when you're dealing with the Government, you don't

4

necessarily draw the same inferences from language as you

5

do in a law that affects only private litigants.

6

MR. KER:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

However, in the Library of Congress v. Shaw, the issue is

8

dealing with interest upon attorneys' fees and that's

9

clearing an area that the Federal Government has never,

10
. 11

historically, never waived sovereign immunity as to that
factor.

12

-

But that was a case dealing with

QUESTION:

Well, that question in that case was

13

whether they'd waived it and the Court said they haven't

14

by general language.

15

general language and the argument is here if they waived

16

their immunity to the extent that you are arguing for it

17

here.

J

And here you're talking about

meS

18

MR. KER:

However, Your Honor, in — again, I

19

submit that Shaw is distinguishable upon that fact because

20

in Shaw the issue was whether or not the interest upon

21

attorneys' fees had been waived.

22

that the Bowen case is more analogous.

And, again, I submit

23

In Bowen, which deal with 405(g), in that case

24

this Court stated that even though we're dealing with an

25

area of sovereign immunity that should be strictly

petitioner would impose the tolling of the statute in

12

MR. KER:

No, sir.

No, sir.

What I mean is is

2

that following the plain language, clear intention of

3

Congress argument, coupling those two — and again, the

4

language is not so plain as to do away with any ambiguity.

5

I'm not saying that either.

6

in 16(c) is so similar to 405(g) that that extension of

7

the tolling into that area of sovereign immunity certainly

8

comports with the overall objective of Congress.

9

QUESTION:

However, the language that is

You really think it's a big

10

difference.

11

90 days and you think it really shows a different intent

12

if it says, suit must be brought or shall be brought

13

within 90 days?

it —

It says no suit shall be brought later than

MR. KER:

Mr. Justice Scalia, I would say that

probably the distinction is — is fine in that area, but

It sure is.

distinguish the cases that way, but don't you think we

1

MR. KER:

2

QUESTION:

3

Absolutely, Your Honor, and the —
So we should choose between Soriano

and Bowen (inaudible).

4

MR. KER:

Yes, sir, and the circuits are --

5

while they are divided I think the majority of the

6

circuits support the petitioner's argument here that it is

7

subject to equitable tolling, and I might add one other

8

thing, too.
In the Hallstrom case, the language there was

9
10

much more specific.

11

And you may not bring an action prior to 60-day notice.

12

That type of language is the type of language that if

13

Congress had used it, we wouldn't be here today.

14

language as used has within, again, the meaning of the

15

words used and within the intent of Congress, we submit,

16

does show that equitable tolling was not to be

17

specifically excluded.

18

they would have said so.

19

It talked about actions prohibited.

But the

That had Congress intended such,

Even in the legislative history of the 1972

20

amendments we don't find any language specifically

21

addressing any prohibition upon the — the application of

22

equitable tolling.

23

There's another fine distinction in the Bowen

24

case.

25

Secretary of the -- I want to say Health, Education and

In the Bowen case the statute there allowed the

1

Welfare — it's Health and Human Services — allowed a

2

legal tolling in that case.

3

distinguishing factor here because even within Bowen,

4

which had the legal tolling ability, still applied the

5

equitable tolling principle.

6

Bowen is applicable here.

7

That also is not a

And the -- I submit that

An —• an additional factor, too, that addressed

8

the subject matter jurisdiction is that the cases that

9

this Court has decided concerning administrative remedies

10

and the application of equitable tolling there, I submit

11

that the administrative exhaustion of remedies is

12

certainly more central to subject matter jurisdiction

13

being exercised by the district court than the filing

14

period.

15

private employee, in both of those situations, the

16

exhaustion remedies has been held to be subject to

17

equitable tolling.

18

But in Bowen and in Zipes, Federal employee and

I've gotten into my second point, that being of

19

legislative intent to some degree.

20

the 1972 amendments were enacted against the backdrop of

21

cases that were liberally construing the remedial nature

22

of the statute to protect the intended class and that the

23

Federal employees were intended to have essentially the

24

same rights as the private employees.

25

And I might add that

In that respect, too, the Federal Government
11

1

should be the example for all of our society in the
eradication of discrimination.

It would — it would not

3

be consistent in — I would submit it this way.

4

consistent with the overall purpose of the act to allow

5

the Federal Government to — to not be subject to

6

equitable tolling where there is, we submit, a broad

7

waiver of immunity, where that would operate to preclude

8

the intended class, where such would be in essence laying

9

behind the law.

10
11

It just wasn't the intent of Congress in

my — in my humble opinion to have that happen.
The legislative history again reveals that

12

Congress had adopted the previous cases, both this Court's

13

and the lower courts', concerning administrative

14

exhaustion.

15

stated more specifically had they intended a nonwaiver.

16

The third basis is that of existing case law.

Against that backdrop, Congress could have

17

Zipes and Crown, Cork and Seal held that filing

18

requirements for the private sector employees were subject

19

to equitable tolling.

20

Bowman held that the administrative exhaustion was subject

21

to equitable tolling.

22

Federal employee arena has recently held in Rennie v.

23

Garrett at 896 Fed. 2d 1057th that — and in that case

24

they reverse Sims v. Heckler, held that the exhaustion of

25

remedies was not a jurisdictional requirement for the

Albemarle Paper and Franks v.

2

subjects the Federal employees to summary dismissal

3

resulting from factual determinations made beyond the face

4

of plaintiff's pleadings, a determination of which is

5

prohibited in the private sector cases.

6

If Congress intended the Federal employees to be

7

treated similarly and essentially the same as private

8

employees, we would submit that that language should hold

9

true and that the equitable tolling apply.
The language that I was looking for in the Bowen

10

^

11

v. City of New York is that the accepting of the

12

proposition, quoting this Court, however does not answer

13

the question whether equitable tolling can be applied to

14

the statute of limitations, for in construing the statute

15

we must be careful not to assume the authority to narrow

16

the waiver Congress intended or to construe the waiver

17

unduly restrictively.

MR. KER:

479.
Thank you, Your — I was just going to

Thank you, Mr. Justice Scalia.
In the Bowen case this Court went on to state

5

further that the application of the traditional equitable

6

tolling principle is fulling consistent with the overall

7

congressional purpose and nowhere eschewed by Congress.

8

And I believe that is found on page 480.

9

In that respect, we had the same situation

10

existing here that the equitable tolling is fully

11

consistent with the overall congressional purposes, and

12

the language, both in the statute itself and in the

13

legislative history does not indicate that Congress had

14

intended anything else.

15

The second issue before the Court is whether or
ft

16

not the notice must be had by the claimant himself or

17

whether a constructive notice applies.

18

submit that there are a plain language argument to be made

19

on behalf of the petitioner and that we look to the

20

statute, the regulations, the notice letter itself, and

21

again, case decisions.

QUESTION:

MR. KER:

No, sir.

The lower circuits are even

Health, Education and Welfare, in Rea v. Middendorf, and

16

in Bell v. Brown, the D.C. Circuit, the Eighth Circuit,

Now, in that particular language, the transition

from the consumer — the CSC, the Civil Service

Commission, to the EEOC, there was the deletion in that

has argued that, well, that clearly shows an intent that

constructive notice or these rules of agency apply.

And the Government

7

And we submit that the dropping of the word his

did not change any of the case law and that it simply was

to make that particular regulation neutrally —■ as far as

whether or not constructive notice would apply.

12

in the very next regulation, 1613.282, Notice of Right to

The language that was deleted from

petitioner's quotation showed, as the Court noted in Bowen

18

that Congress itself in the statute waiving sovereign

immunity, had expressly provided for tolling in certain

circumstances and therefore it was reasonable to assume

21

that the 60-day period was not an absolute jurisdictional

Yes, I think the distinguishing

20

factor in Bowen is that there Congress itself in the

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

12

of sovereign immunity.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think not, Your Honor.

3

For example, in the Chandler case, the issue was what type

of a trial do you get when you file your lawsuit.

5

think considerations of sovereign immunity were implicated

6

there in terms of whether it was a trial de novo or

administrative review.

I don't

8

Here, however, the issue is whether the suit can

9

be brought at all beyond the time period that Congress had

10

specified.

And their considerations of sovereign immunity

11

are paramount, as they were in the Shaw case, for example.

12

The court had previously held private parties were

13

entitled to an award of interest on attorneys' fees.

14

Congress intended to treat the United States like a

private employer.

2

question that petitioner seeks to raise, the tolling of

Now --

QUESTION:

Do you think the EEOC -- do you think

6

this time limit could be waived?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

9
10

I guess not.

No, Your Honor, it's at the

executive —■
QUESTION:

It has to be done by the Congress.

MR. ROBERTS:

Correct.

And the Court emphasized

11

in the Soriano case that the Court had no authority to

12

enforce relief against the sovereign beyond the limits set

13

by Congress and that in this area as no other, Congress is

14

entitled to assume when it set a time period, that it

15

meant that time period and not a longer one.

16

Now, my brother points to the language of the

17

statute that says the Federal employees may bring an

action is authorized.

2

section.

4

So, that

Now, on the second question presented, the

5

position of the United States is that the normal rule

6

should apply and that notice to an attorney that one has

7

designated to handle his affairs in a particular manner

8

constitutes notice to the claimant himself.

9

Here, the EEOC did what the petitioner asked him

10

to do, sent notice to his -- designated counsel of record.

11

Notice was accepted at the offices of the designated

12

counsel of record by an employee authorized to do so.

13

That's when the 30-day period began to run, not the later

14

time when the notice was actually received by the employee

15

or the still later time when petitioner's counsel actually

16

read the notice.

17

This Court doesn't have to envision

18

hypotheticals to understand how unworkable a rule would be

19

that depended upon when the lawyer actually read the

20

notice.

QUESTION:

What would have happened if somebody-

2

in the lawyer's office got in touch with the EEOC and

3

asked them — told them that he was over in Vietnam?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Your Honor, in fact the EEOC has a

5

regulation warning claimants that if they're going to be

6

—if they're going to be a prolonged absence from the

7

residence, the address they've given them, to notify the

8

EEOC precisely for that contingency.

9
10

QUESTION:

That's what happens.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in that case the EEOC would

11

be sure not to send a notice until the prolonged absence

12

was over, or the claimant could make other arrangements

13

for handling the matter if his lawyer was going to be

14

absence from the country.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

That applies to claimants.

Does it

refer to attorneys or just claimants?
MR. ROBERTS:

The regulation, which is 29 C.F.R.

18

1607, a subsection of that, speaks in terms of claimants.

19

It says that claimant should provide his address to the

20

EEOC, any change of address — which was not done in this

case — and any prolonged absences that he anticipates.

And as the district court

10

noted that there was no dispute here, that petitioner's

counsel represented petitioner throughout the litigation.

12

This was petitioner's lawyer.

Any question of

what to do after the lawyer receives notice is a matter

14

between the client and his lawyer and shouldn't affect the

triggering of the jurisdictional period.

16

Now, in fact, the Court need not reach the

question of when the time period began to run because

either — under either the view of the United States that

it began when the notice was received at petitioner's

accept it, or under petitioner's view that it begins only

22
