ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court is called upon in this case to

12

construe the following language in the Equal Access to

13

Justice Act, a law which provides for attorneys' fees

14

against the Federal Government, and that language is,

15

party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall

16

within 30 days of final judgment in the action submit to

17

the court an application for fees and other expenses which

18

shows that that party is the prevailing party."

19

"A

The question here is whether, as we maintain and

20

as was universally the law prior to the decision below,

21

that this limitations period may only be triggered by a

22

court judgment, or whether, as the respondent, Secretary

23

of Health and Human Services contends, this statute can be

24

triggered by an administrative decision of an

25

administrative agency.

This case began in 1982 when petitioner applied

1

for Social Security disability benefits under the SSI

3

program.

4

through the administrative process and the case proceeded

5

to the Federal district court.

6

the case was remanded before any proceedings on the merits

7

or any decisions on the merits by the district judge.

case was remanded for the taking of new evidence before

9

the administrative agency.

party in the litigation.

13

the taking of new evidence.

14

1985, the appeals counsel of the Social Security

15

Administration found this petitioner disabled, and later

16

in that year, approximately 4 months later, benefits were

17

actually paid to this petitioner.

18

The case was simply remanded for
A few months later, in May of

In May of 1985, approximately 5 months after —

19

excuse me, 8 months after that, the petitioner filed an

20

application for attorney fees under the Equal Access to

21

Justice Act.

22

and the district court denied attorney fees on the ground

23

that the Government's position had been substantially

24

justified.

application for fees, was untimely.
Petitioner appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and

3

again the Secretary did not argue that the petition, the

4

application was untimely.

5

briefed, and after that full briefing but before argument,

6

the Ninth Circuit, sua sponte, raised the issue of the

7

timeliness of the fee application, although the sua sponte

8

order indicated that the first judgment of the district

9

court remanding the case might have triggered the statute.

In fact the case was fully

10

Later, however, when the Secretary did take a

11

position in response to the sua sponte order, the issue

12

became whether the administrative decision could trigger

13

the limitations period.

14

Later the Ninth Circuit did indeed hold that the

15

administrative decision could trigger the limitations

16

period and that the decision of the administrative agency

17

would become final within 30 days of that decision, thus

18

triggering that a fee application would have to be filed

19

within 30 days of that administrative decision.

20

Secretary originally in his opposition agreed with that

21

position, but on the merits, the brief on the merits in

22

this Court has adjusted his position somewhat and says

23

that the decision of the administrative agency becomes

24

final 65 days after it is issued, and then the 30-day

25

period is thus triggered after that.

ought to be reversed we want to focus here on three

3

things:

and some practical considerations which we think merit

5

reversal.

the statutory language, the legislative history,

6

Turning first to the statutory language, the

7

term "judgment" is quite clearly a reference to the

8

decision of a Federal court, and that is indeed the

9

language used by Congress.

Decisions of administrative

10

agencies simply are never called judgments.

11

— indeed the Secretary himself does not call any of his

12

decisions judgments, but rather decisions, determinations,

13

denials of review, and such like that.

14

law generally administrative agencies make awards, issue

15

orders, make decisions, rulings, but they do not render

16

judgments.

17

QUESTION:

The Secretary

In administrative

Mr. Wolfman, I think I agree with you

18

that normally that's, that's the way we would interpret

19

words like that, but we have already interpreted other

20

words in d(l)A in a way that's a little unusual.

21

to say, we have held that although you're entitled — it

22

only says you're entitled to fees — fees and other

23

expenses incurred by that party in any civil action.

24
25

That is

Now I would normally think that civil action
meant only a suit before a law court as well, and not an

action before an agency.

2

entitle you to a fee before the agency.

3

that if we give that phrase a little bit of an unusual

4

meaning, in order to make sense out of the whole provision

5

we're going to have to give the phrase "judgment" a little

6

bit of an unusual meaning too.

MR. WOLFMAN:

But we have interpreted that to
It seems to me

Well, you're referring, of course,

to the Sullivan v. Hudson case.
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. WOLFMAN:

In that case the Court said that

11

if there is existing a pending civil action, that

12

administrative decisions on remand can be considered part

13

of that civil action if they have a very intimate

14

relationship with the remand.

15

hold that administrative proceedings in the first instance

16

are compensable under the EAJA, unless of course there are

17

adversary proceedings under a different provision of the

18

EAJA section —

1

civil action broadly that way to include everything, it

2

seems to me you ought to interpret judgment broadly to

3

include anything at either level.

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

I would submit, Justice Scalia,

5

that they are two entirely different phrases, and I don't

6

— when we get to the practical considerations, which I

7

would be glad to address, there is no reason to expand

8

that.

9

I think in the Sullivan v. Hudson case the Court

10

was expanding upon earlier decisions in the attorney fee

11

area that said administrative proceedings that are

12

necessary for the vindication of rights that are asserted

13

in that civil action must be compensated, or you would

14

really make illusory the purpose behind the fee statute.

15

I don't think we have that with the definition of

16

"judgment."

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, if you read further on

18

in the language you're construing, where it says a

19

judgment is final and not appealable, I get the sense

20

Congress was not using terms of art here.

21

What does the

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, in this particular case that

23

was a response in the 1985 amendments to the law which,

24

after a district court, for instance, issued a judgment,

25

Congress felt it was best not to force the applicant to

efficiency, to have everything complete in the district

7

tribunals.

8

9

QUESTION:

And that is what

It makes — it is not a reference

Well, so Congress meant by saying not

appealable that the time for appeal must have run?

10

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is correct.

11

In the American administrative law generally, as

12

I was saying, judgments are not normally issued — never

13

are issued in our procedures.

14

Administrative Procedure Act, sets definitions for scores

15

of agency proceedings -- before scores of agencies, and it

16

uses various terminology such as order, disposition, and

17

so on, but never the term judgment.

18

Indeed the APA, the

But even conceding that an agency could call its

19

decision a judgment, the question here is what Congress

20

believed when it enacted the EAJA, and it surely drafted

21

that terminology with the ordinary usage in mind.

22

Indeed at four different points in the

23

provisions that are before the Court today the term

24

"judgment" is used, and each time it appears to be a

25

reference to the decision of a court.

In fact twice there

QUESTION:

6

There is no

Mr. Wolfman, in circumstances such as

7

we have in this case, where your client obtained the

8

relief sought and where the Government is precluded from

9

filing any appeal, who is it that's going to go back to

10

the district court and get a judgment, do you suppose?
MR. WOLFMAN:

11

It could be either party.

As a

12

matter of practice, and is still as a matter of the

13

Secretary's practice, and the Secretary still tells every

14

claimant nationwide that he will go back and file certain

15

papers, but that he also will get some type of final

16

disposition in the action.

He fully won.

MR. WOLFMAN:

11

That is correct.

Well, that is true, but that is a

determination that we make in hindsight.

13

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

So, you say the

14

Secretary's practice is to go up after that to the court

15

and have a judgment entered?

16

MR. WOLFMAN:

17

practice by and large.

18

but my experience and in the forms attached to our brief

19

it is clearly the Secretary's intention to do that in

20

every case.

21

that he doesn't intend to follow that practice in every

22

case if he prevails here, a concession that he still

23

follows that practice and sends forms to every claimant

24

and every claimant's representative that he will do so

now.

The EAJA itself draws the distinction I am

2

suggesting between agency decision making and court

judicial decision making, the same distinction that we

urge.

to work done only at the administrative level in adversary

6

proceedings without the requirement of a court action, the

disposition in the action, where in the provision at issue

here for work associated with court proceedings, the fee

In section 504 of the EAJA, the part which pertains

10

application must be filed within 30 days of the final

11

judgment, as we have said.

12

Indeed, taking it a step further, section 504

13

says, and I am quoting now, the party shall within 30 days

14

of final disposition in the adversary adjudication submit

15

to the agency — to the agency, the fee application.

16

While under section 2412(d), the provision at issue in

17

this case, the party shall within 30 days of final

18

judgment in the action, and I am quoting, submit to the

cour^t the fee application.

words strongly suggests it is the court whose judgment

21

triggers the limitations period.

Now this juxtaposition of the

No, Your Honor.

If such a

petition had been filed fees would have been denied

The Secretary does not

Most importantly as to the legislative history,

14

the committee report actually addressed the very issue

15

before the Court today.

16

and stated that in this context, in the Social Security

17

context, the administrative decision after remand is not a

final judgment for statute of limitations purposes, and

19

only a post-remand decision of some sort could provide

20

that trigger.

It proved the existing case law

And finally, the thrust of the 1985 amendments,

22

both in the amendments and its legislative history, were

And the final thing I would like to turn to is

some of the practical considerations.

argues that our view would place a great administrative

burden on the court.

The Secretary

That is simply not the case.

We are

not requiring the Secretary to file an enormous number of

12

reason to do so for merits litigation, then that needs to

be done.

14

all that is necessary is some type of post-remand final

adjudication that discontinues this piece of litigation.

We are talking about a one-page form order that can be

gotten by the Secretary, if the Secretary desires, to run

8

statute has no requirement whatsoever that the limitations

period necessarily run.

The

If the Secretary wants to provide

10

a time bar and put the onus on the claimant, he can do so.

11

Not only does the statute not indicate that, but the

12

legislative history makes quite clear that applications

13

that are filed — and let me give you an example.

14

instance, a district court issues a memorandum order and

15

opinion granting summary, in effect granting summary

judgment, but the court does not until much later, which

17

is sometimes the case, file a judgment under rule 58 of

MR. WOLFMAN:

That means that after the final

applicant has 30 days in which to file a fee petition.

16

that judgment is never sought or obtained, if the

If it says you shall.within 30 days of final judgment in

that would presuppose that there is a final judgment.

QUESTION:

Well, how do you read that language?

3

A party seeking an award of fees shall within 30 days of

final judgment submit to the court an application.

5

MR. WOLFMAN:

That language, Your Honor, sets

6

the outmost time in which someone could file a fee

7

application if there exists a final judgment.

8

Posner said in the McDonald case, that deadline -- that is

9

not a starting point, it's a deadline.

10

As Judge

It's not a

requirement, but it is a deadline if it does exist.

11

Now, we are not suggesting that --

QUESTION:

Well, you could, on your theory you

13

could wait, you could wait a couple of years after you

14

prevail, I don't suppose you would because you want your

15

money, but you could wait a year and never have a final

16

judgment, and anytime you wanted to you could just file

17

for fees?

18
19

Is that — that's your position, I take it?
MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, our position is that, but

that occurs only if the Secretary allows it to —

*

20

QUESTION:

I would suppose the requirement for

21

being relatively prompt at filing fees indicates that

22

there should in all cases be some sort of a deadline.

23

MR. WOLFMAN:

And that I think is precisely why

24

the Secretary is telling every claimant around the Nation

25

that he will make post-remand filings and get an order.

One of those answers is that

The other answer is that this will happen only if

QUESTION:

It will not otherwise

Mr. Wolfman, you talk as though the

8

position you're arguing applies only in Social Security

9

cases, and you say it's the practice of the Secretary to

10

file these things automatically.

11

Justice Act doesn't just apply to the Social Security Act.

12

So it would have to be every agency of the Government

13

which, upon remand from a court, when the agency action

14

has been reversed, every agency of the Government would

15

then have to come back to that district court, I take it,

16

in order to cut off, you know, years later seeking fees

17

under the EAJA.

But the Equal Access to

Isn't that right?

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is right, but I think there

19

is an answer to that.

First of all I think frequently in

the administrative — not always, but sometimes in the

21

administrative context that first order may in fact be an

22

order in which the person prevailed, in which they

23

actually got some or all of what they wanted.

contexts very frequently the court remanding does retain

jurisdiction, and it is indeed expected, like it was in

This is a sentence 6.

different argument then, because under a sentence 6 remand

16

you have to come back to the court.

MR. WOLFMAN:

I absolutely agree, Your Honor.

And do I understand you to say this

is in your view a sentence 6 remand case here?

15

MR. WOLFMAN':

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is.

And

16

the reason it is is because the substance of what occurred

17

in the district court is that the Secretary, having seen

18

evidence, additional evidence that was not previously

19

available at the first administrative hearing, asked the

20

court to remand the case to consider that new evidence.

21

That is a particular provision that makes for a sentence 6

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you told the —■ your

answer to the Chief Justice was that the 30 days was just

an outer limit, and that you could make application for

fees at any time before that?

8

MR. WOLFMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Well —

And if you're prevailing as to part

10

of the action, can you then apply for fees as to that

11

part, and then come back and apply for more fees when the

12

final determination is made by the agency?

13

MR. WOLFMAN:

Indeed I think that's — that is a

14

possibility.

15

interim fees, if you will, are permitted under this

16

statute, and sometimes that is necessary in litigation in

17

which you have prevailed on a substantial amount of what

18

has occurred but you haven't completed all your work,

19

there is some post-judgment work to be done.

20

generally permits that.

21

The legislative history makes clear that

But that's one of the nice things about our

approach, because in this case, where it usually is pretty

tell that by the time it gets back to the district court,

2

will pretty much be the time where the entire petition

with all the work can be presented to the district court.

So I think that's one of the nice things about the

Well, then neither the first part nor

the second part of sentence 6 seems to apply.

MR. WOLFMAN:

I respectfully disagree with that,

Mr. Sloan, we'll hear now from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SLOAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Equal Access to Justice Act imposes a time
limitation on applications for attorneys' fees.

The act

requires that an application for attorneys' fees be filed
within 30 days of final judgment in the action.

In our

view the Secretary's post-remand decision is the final
judgment in the action, when it is final and not
appealable, and has therefore effectively terminated the
action on the merits.
We believe that this interpretation is the
correct reading of the Equal Access to Justice Act and the
Social Security Act, and that it is strongly supported by
this Court's decisions in Hudson and in Finkelstein.

We

also believe that it provides a fair and practicable
approach ft>r all concerned.
Petitioner's interpretation is that courts must
enter orders solely to start the attorneys' fees clock
*

running, and that if they do not do so there is simply no
attorneys' fees time limitation at all.

We believe the

petitioner's interpretation is contrary to the governing
statutes, and that it mandates a cumbersome procedure

which is neither compelled nor warranted by the governing

statutes.
This Court's decisions in Hudson and in

11

Indeed in Hudson it was argued to the Court that

civil actions should be interpreted solely with respect to

events that happen in a courtroom, and the Court rejected

that position.

also reject petitioner's argument that the final judgment

2

And when review has run out, the proceedings have been

3

terminated on the merits.

4

The second point, though, is that this brings up

5

a fundamental point about the Equal Access to Justice Act

6

and a fundamental problem in petitioner's position.

7

that is that the Equal Access to Justice Act takes other

statutes and statutory schemes as it finds them.

And to the extent that there are

But that doesn't mean that the attorneys' fees

15

statute itself has some kind of power or authority to

impose additional requirements on the administration of

17

those statutory schemes solely for the purpose of

18

facilitating attorneys' fees applications, which is the

19

burden of petitioner's position, that somehow the

20

attorneys' fees statute, which in its structure is

designed to allow for the recovery of attorneys' fees for

actions in other proceedings, somehow has the power to

Is there any provision of law that requires a district

The district court's order

said it is remanded for all further proceedings, period.
There is absolutely no indication in that remand order
that it was contemplated that it would come back to court.
And it would seem likely that a district court would be
surprised if a year later or a few months later somebody
came back and said okay, now dismiss this action, when the
district court had specifically said it is remanded for
all further proceedings, period.

No, the judge does not.
So he can't by those all further

proceedings mean he is precluding any further review by

precluding, but it does mean that a party that is not

MR. SLOAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But as

11

to whether it was unusual that the U.S. Attorney did not

12

go back, that's the point I was trying to emphasize

13

before, at the risk of sounding nonresponsive, which was

14

that the practice varied in local U.S. Attorneys' offices.

of the Department that it was appropriate to go back and

QUESTION:

MR. SLOAN:

That's right.

To my knowledge the

practice is not.

8

has grown up in the particular context of the Social

percentage of remands of district court actions, and also

in which there is --

Is it also — not also true that a

very high percentage of EAJA applications are in Social

15

MR. SLOAN:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

You rely on Sullivan v. Hudson, and

17

there we said the procedure set forth in 42 U.S.C. 405(g)

18

contemplates additional action both by the Secretary and

19

the district court before civil action is concluded

20

following a remand.

21

to this case, or is it wrong?

22

MR. SLOAN:

Is that observation just inapplicable

Well, we believe that it is

23

inapplicable to this case because, as the Court clarified

24

in Finkelstein, that would apply in a sentence 6 remand,

25

and we believe this was not a sentence 6 remand.

And the

court had addressed the comments in Hudson in its decision
in Finkelstein, it said that that applies to sentence 6
remands rather than to all other remands.
QUESTION:

Is this under 405(g) at all?

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, it is.

pursuant to 405(g).

The action was filed

There is a provision — 405(g)

applies to title II of the Social Security Act.

This was

under title XVI, and there's a provision in title XVI that
incorporates 405(g) by reference.
QUESTION:

Well, under your view what statutory

authority did the court act under when it remanded the
case?
MR. SLOAN:
as part of 405(g).

It acted under an implied authority
This was not a sentence 4 remand

either, but it was -QUESTION:
a 405(g) action.

So then it's a little odd to say it's

You say it was implied?

I supposed it's

just the general supervisory powers of the courts, or the
general authority of the courts?
MR. SLOAN:

Well, one could view it that way, or

also as an incident to the grant of authority in 405(g)
6

itself.
QUESTION:

So then our observation in Sullivan

v. Hudson was, at the least, incomplete?
MR. SLOAN:

Well, as the Court clarified in

sentence 6 remands.

incomplete?
MR. SLOAN:

5
6

So the case you rely on is

Well, we are relying on Hudson and

Finkelstein taken together, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

At least you want us to complete it?

8

QUESTION:

And I take it you do take the

9

position that if it is a sentence 6 remand it has to go

10

back to the district court and there would have to be a

11

final judgment from that court?

12
13
14

MR. SLOAN:
Honor.

We do take that position, Your

And —
QUESTION:

So we're only talking here about

15

what, sentence 4 remands and this other vague implied

16

remand that you say exists under the statute?

17

MR. SLOAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the

18

distinction between sentence 6 remands and other remands

19

is important because it illustrates the difference between

20

the kind of remand that is contemplated under sentence 6,

21

in which the court retains jurisdiction explicitly and it

22

remands only for a very limited purpose, the taking of

23

additional evidence.

24

envisioned in sentence 6 that it will come back to the

25

court, as opposed to the situation in other remands.

And then it is specifically

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

1

Because of the special category of sentence 6

2

remands and its implications both for the administrative

3

action and for the district court, we suggest that it's

4

appropriate to have a clear statement rule with respect to

5

sentence 6 remands.

6

action of retaining jurisdiction and requiring additional

7

filings and additional proceedings in the district court,

8

the district court should clearly and unequivocally say

so, because of the special nature of these sentence 6

remands.

And if the court wants to take the

QUESTION:

There are other statutes that have

12

the equivalent of section 6 remands in them that

specifically authorize the court to remand to the agency

for the taking of further evidence, aren't there?

15

MR. SLOAN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, there are.
And do you think an agency has

authority to do that even apart from an explicit provision

in the statute?

the exceptional step or the burdensome, in some respects,

And

1

then if the court does not clearly say so, the inference

2

should be the other way.
Now, petitioner has emphasized as a great

3

practical problem with our approach the fact that it

5

requires distinguishing between sentence 6 remands and

6

other remands, but the key point about that is that we're

7

not creating that distinction.

8

creates that distinction, and this Court elaborated on

that distinction in Finkelstein.

to that fundamental principle of the attorneys' fees

have a final judgment at exactly the same time that you

Mr. Sloan, can I ask you this

they decided the man was disabled.

that was the view that the court of appeals took.

the time when the clock would start to run would have that

MR. SLOAN:

Right.

And that -- what we would

say the appropriate position would be is that after the

19

appeals counsel's decision, then there is 65 days for •

20

review -- 5 days presumed for mailing of the notice, and

21

60 days.

22

the appeals counsel's decision has become final and not

appealable, and the 30 days would begin at that time.

And at that point if there is no further review,

I understand that.
But, were you referring specifically

Yeah.

It appears to me that there

probably are some neighborhood lawyers who get this kind

12

of case and are not specialists in the field, and might

13

not realize that the final judgment is something that

14

occurs 65 days after the end of the administrative

proceeding.

MR. SLOAN:

Well, it would certainly be

appropriate to have the administrative documents be as

clear as possible on that so that everybody knows what the

Mr. Sloan, lest silence be deemed

sentence 6 case the Secretary can avoid going back by

simply saying something to the district court.

judgment.

MR. SLOAN:

As I read

Your Honor, I was not saying at all

that the mere fact that the Secretary says something means

he won't come back.

Secretary can ask the district court to include in its

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WOLFMAN:

First to respond to Justice Stevens.

Very briefly, Your Honor.

13

Approximately 93 percent of all EAJA petitions were in the

14

Social Security context in the last fiscal year.

is being suggested here is this microscopic look at the
