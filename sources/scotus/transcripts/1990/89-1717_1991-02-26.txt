ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FOWLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Terrance Bostick was reclining on the rear-most

11

seat in a Greyhound bus when he was approached by Officer

12

Nutt.
Office Nutt spoke to Mr. Bostick in a

Officer Nutt told Mr. Bostick at

22

the time that he requested the consent for the search of

23

the blue bag that he had the right to refuse.

MS. FOWLER:

Is that clear or is that disputed?

Yes, all right.
But the encounter between Mr. —
But he could have — you think it is

clear enough that we judge the case on the basis that he

11

was told that he could refuse the search?
MS. FOWLER:

Yes, absolutely.

These officers

were wearing plain cloths covered with a windbreaker which

14

had a sheriff's department insignia on the shoulders.

15

also said sheriff's department across the back.

aisle.
There was still sufficient room for Mr. Bostick

2
3

to have gotten up and left the bus, had he so chosen.

4

the State would urge that that is not the test, that —

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. FOWLER:

But

And then the bus would go off?
That is correct.

That is possible

7

that that would happen.

But I believe that a more correct

8

test under these circumstances is whether or not Mr.

9

Bostick was free to terminate the encounter, whether or

10

not he could have merely told the officers that he was not

11

interested in talking to them.

12

If he had done so, that would have been the end

13

of the matter and the officers would have gone on, either

^

14

to other passengers or gotten off the bus if they did not

y

15

get any cooperation from any other passengers.

16

QUESTION:

Does that beg the question?

17

you say he could have ended the encounter.

18

ended the conversation to the extent that it was a two-

19

way conversation, but the question is whether there is a

20

detention.

21

and unless he wanted to get off the bus and be left

22

behind, he would still be there.

23

He could have

And the police officer would still be there

So isn't the question not whether an encounter

24

could be, in the sense of the conversation could be ended,

25

but whether there was a detention and whether that could

1

be ended?

2

MS. FOWLER:

Justice Souter, I think the answer

3

to that question is that, it is whether or not there was a

4

restraint of Mr. Bostick's liberties, so as to rise to the

5

level of a seizure.

6

QUESTION:

And that isn't, the answer to that

7

question is not synonymous with the answer to the question

8

whether the conversation, the verbal interaction between

9

them could have been ended, is it?

10

MS. FOWLER:

If the verbal conversation had

11

ended, the officers would have moved on.

If they had not

12

moved on then — if Mr. Bostick had said, Officer Nutt, I

13

do not want to talk to you, I want to go to sleep, and

—

14

then Officer Nutt had gone further, then that probably

7

15

would have given rise to a seizure.

16
17

But if he had said, no, and the officers had
moved on, that is what we assume would have occurred.

18

QUESTION:

Well, yes, if.

I mean, that is the

19

assumption that we have to make for your argument to work.

20

Isn't it?

21

MS. FOWLER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes.
And we don't have anything to go on

but assumption, do we?
MS. FOWLER:

We have, I believe, the officer's

testimony which is that he would have moved on.

3

And we are not saying that here today.

What we

are saying is that —
QUESTION:

Well, you are not.

Because you

4

responded to Justice Stevens, that this would not be

5

grounds for giving added suspicion to either these police

6

or to police in another jurisdiction.

7

So I think that is consistent with your answer.

8

MS. FOWLER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Would it be consistent with your

10

position for the police to call ahead to the next city

11

where the bus comes in, and suggest to them that without

12

basing any reasonable suspicion, that they just

13

reinterrogate the same person?

14

Would there be anything wrong with that?

15

MS. FOWLER:

16
17

I am not sure that they would have

a basis for doing that.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact that he — unlike so

18

many thousands of people who are willing to let their bags

19

be searched, unlike so many, he just wouldn't let them

20

search his bag.

21

I gather from the history of this, that most

22

people are willing to allow their bags to be searched.

23

MS. FOWLER:

Right.

What we have learned is

24

that most people feel a moral compulsion to cooperate with

25

police officers, especially when they are informed about

the problems that we have with drugs.

2
3

QUESTION:

I just —

Problems they are not aware of until

the officer has confronted them on the bus, I suppose.

4

MS. FOWLER:

Or they may well be aware of them

5

because it is all over the media.

6

know, people have — they know of people in the community

7

that have problems.

8
9

It is all over, you

I mean, it is common knowledge that drugs are a
very serious problem in this country.

So I don't think

10

that most people, when they are approached by officers,

11

that that is the first time that they have heard about a

12

drug problem, but that might give rise to why they are

13

more likely to cooperate.

14
15

I really can't give you a yes or no answer as to
whether or not calling ahead would be proper.

16

QUESTION:

Why would it then — are you urging a

17

"no harm in asking" rule?

cause or anything just to come up and say, do you mind if

the law involved in simply asking somebody.
MS. FOWLER:

2

Right.

I just have a concern that

3

if you do this, you know, 25 times, that might be a

4

problem.

And that that question is not —
QUESTION:

5

Well, that could be police

6

harassment, but it has nothing to do with whether it is a

7

violation of the Fourth Amendment, I would assume.

8

MS. FOWLER:

QUESTION:

10

Okay.

That is correct.

I mean, consistently, with the rest

of your case.

11

MS. FOWLER:

Correct.

Thank you, Your Honor.

12

What we need to look here, is to whether or not

13

the actions of the officers, the totality of their actions

14

were reasonable and whether or not they caused a restraint

15

of liberty of Mr. Bostick.

MS. FOWLER:

In the bus driver's deposition he

23

stated that they left 20 minutes late.

unclear as to whether that was a direct result of Mr.

Bostick's arrest.

However, it is

1

Suppose the police did delay the bus

3

would that have any bearing on the case or would it change

their rights to do whatever investigation is required.

21
22

QUESTION:

Ms. Fowler, backing up a little, why

did they go straight to the back of the bus?
MS. FOWLER:

What we have learned from the

23

officers is that they try to approach as many people on

24

the bus as they can within the time allotted to them.

25

so it is easier —

MS. FOWLER:

Their practice is to start in the

MS. FOWLER:

They had some reason, didn't they?
Pardon me?
Wouldn't it appear that they had a

reason, to start at the back instead of the front?
MS. FOWLER:

10

^
^

Well, why didn't they start in the

I think that the reason, the only

11

reason that I have been given is that it is just their

12

standard practice because they do exit the vehicle when

13

they get to the front of the bus.

14
15

Otherwise, they would go to the front, to the
back and then have to leave again.

Also, there is

16

evidence, not in this record, but in other cases, that

17

drug dealers prefer to be in the back of the bus because

18

they have more — they are more concealed.

19

And that is something that —

20

QUESTION:

21

How do you know what the drug dealers

do?

22

MS. FOWLER:

That is something that police

MR. AYER:

you are talking to that you are indeed armed, and you are
prepared to deal with force if necessary.
QUESTION:

The gun was in a pouch, as I

But also in the more recent opinion in Inyo v.
Brower County, it seems to me the question is something
like this:

Whether intentional police conduct, in the

setting in which it plainly is occurring, that is on a
bus, communicated to a reasonable person, by which I mean
an innocent person, that he is not free to leave the
presence of the officer, assuming that he would want to
leave the presence of the officer.
And I would argue, based on the facts that I
just reviewed that a reasonable person here would plainly
feel that he had been and was being temporarily detained
for the purpose of being questioned by these officers.
QUESTION:

But isn't the fact is, the reason he

didn't want to leave is he didn't want to get off the bus,
not because he didn't want to talk to the officers
necessarily.
MR. AYER:
Justice Kennedy.

Well, I don't think we know that,

I think there is nothing in the record

that indicates —

that everyone who is on a bus that is laying over
temporarily in an intermediate city does not want to get

off that bus, I think as an initial matter, you can
probably say, yes, that is right.
That is, you don't want to get off because you
have a ticket to Atlanta and we are in Ft. Lauderdale, and
I don't want to go to Ft. Lauderdale.

I want to go to

Atlanta.
That doesn't mean that events can't occur on
that bus that can cause you to say, you know, I would just
as soon get off in Ft. Lauderdale.

I would just as soon

not be here being questioned by officer so and so, and I
have changed my mind.

I would like to leave.

I don't think that this Court is in a position,
or would want to make the judgment, that because someone
had bought a through ticket, that they had lost the right
to decide to get off the bus at an intermediate point, if
indeed they decide that that is what they want to do.
And that is why, in stating the tests that I
have stated, I have put it in terms of the intentional
police conduct and its effect, in the setting, on a
person, assuming the person decides he wants to leave.
So I think what you have to look at is the
overall set of factors that would restrict one, apart from
the fact that you generally start with a preference not to
get off the bus.
QUESTION:

Well, now, wait.

Not all the factors

State authority against him, right, either force or the

MR. AYER:

That is correct.

So the mere fact that it is a lot of

trouble to leave, that he would have to take his baggage

out of the baggage compartment of the bus; that he would

irrelevant to whether he thought that force was being

They are irrelevant to the

question of whether they are relevant at all to the Fourth

quasi-private places, places like restaurants, churches,

that police officers or other people may never go in

7

We are going to determine whether he

people typically expect that they are going to be allowed

to go about their business unless there is some

significant reason for interruption.

On the other hand, they are places where

40

SUITE 400

And what that bears upon is not the notion that
it is, a per se, or any other kind of violation, simply to
go on a bus.

It rather bears upon how a reasonable person

would interrupt it.
If you were sitting in a restaurant and an
officer came into the restaurant in uniform, which he
obviously would have a perfect right to do, and he came
directly to your table, and he addressed you and asked you
for your driver's license, the assumption that I think
most people would make would be that the officer was there
in order to carry out some specific, purposeful mission
that the officer needed to carry out.
One wouldn't be, I think, necessarily totally
pleased because one might have the impression that one had
become some sort of a target of inquiry.

And I think that

same kind of reasoning transfers over here, where you are
talking about, say a bus or an airplane or a train, a
situation where I think most people generally expect that
they are not going to be approached.
If they are going to be approached, I will put
it this way, it is going to be for some reason.

Now

again, that doesn't mean that the officers can't ever do
it, and I don't argue that.
I am simply arguing now, what would a reasonable
person conclude from this event occurring?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

And my

suggestion is that a reasonable person would conclude that
the officer was about some business, very purposeful
business; and the officer in this case, both blocking the
way out, displaying force and an ability to use force,
communicates a sense of an intention to accomplish the
mission that he was about.
That is to say, to identify the defendant, look
at his papers and then to go about searching his luggage.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't we be satisfied or why

shouldn't you be satisfied with our deciding this case on
the basis of the facts which the Supreme Court of Florida
recited as being the facts of the case?
MR. AYER:
Honor.

I think that would be fine, Your

I think that would be quite reasonable.
QUESTION:

So we don't know whether he — on A2

they say the facts in this case are succinctly stated by
Judge Letts in his dissenting opinion. Is that good enough
for you?
MR. AYER:

Yes.

I think those are — I think

that is a fair statement of the facts that are really
quite clear on the record.

whether the defendant consented or whether he was informed
of his right, but the conflict must be resolved in favor
of the State —

Mr. Ayer, the problem is even worse

opinion, all of those facts were ultimately irrelevant.

As I understand the Supreme Court of Florida

10

It answered, it rephrased the certified question which was

11

very general and contained no facts in it.
And I gather the basis for its ruling was on A1

12
13

T

of your appendix:

"Does an impermissible seizure result

when police mount a drug search on buses during scheduled
15

stops and question boarded passengers without articulable

16

reasons for doing so, thereby obtaining consent to search

17

the passenger's luggage."

18

There are no details in that at all.

holding.

That is correct.

MR. AYER:

I take

I would — I haven't looked into this

too far, but I would suggest that perhaps it raises a

Court.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather that it was irrelevant

to the Florida Supreme Court what the facts were, so long

5

as the situation came within that rephrased question, they

6

were going to find for the defendant.

7

MR. AYER:

I would not reach that conclusion,

Justice Scalia, based on what follows on page A2, the

9

discussion quoting directly from the dissent in the

back again, the very last paragraph:

"For the foregoing

15

They decided this on the basis of a

rule of law that you can't have bus searches.

16

MR. AYER:

Well, we are certainly not asking

17

this Court for a rule of law that you can't have bus

18

searches.

19

judgment must be made on the basis of all the

20

circumstances.

21

It seems to us perfectly clear that the

And the circumstances here I think really do

break into two categories.

The factors relating to the display of this gun,
in the pouch visible and recognizable as a gun; the
blocking of the aisle that is half way in, half way out of
the aisle; the fact that the door to the bus is closed
throughout this encounter.

How would a person get off the

bus if he wanted to?
Those are unique facts here.

I think everything

I have just said is utterly undisputed on the record.
There is no dispute that those are the facts of this case.
And on those facts, it seems to me, it is very hard to say
that there was not a confinement, especially when you look
at the second category of facts which I would describe as
the generic facts, the generic bus search facts, which I
think frankly raise very serious problems, questions about
whether there is a seizure.
But by no means, is every bus search without
reasonable suspicion, going to involve a seizure.
Again, just to repeat that generic set of facts
includes, as Justice Kennedy noted, it includes the fact
that you have got a busload of passengers who basically
don't want to get off, and the police are taking advantage
of that desire.
Maybe they have their luggage under the bus in
the storage.

Maybe they have given up their ticket.

Maybe they can't afford to stay overnight in Ft.

When you focus in on somebody in those settings,
the normal person is going to say —

15

QUESTION:

Then, Mr. Ayer, how do you square

16

your argument with what this Court held in the Delgado

17

case, where the immigration officers had basically closed

18

off the doors to the work area and the employees were not

But the bigger problem is the fact that people

It seems to me, faced with that case, that you
have kind of an uphill battle here.
MR. AYER:

distinguishable on the ground that the setting is entirely

24

different in the sense of confinement.

25

obviously, there is simply no where to go.

There is not a

foot or two hardly to move in.
In the factory, the opinion for the Court made

2

3

clear that there is an opportunity to move around the

4

factory.

5
6

QUESTION:

But they weren't free to leave it,

MR. AYER:

were they?

7

But I think the question is,

8

would a reasonable person feel that they were put in a

9

situation where they were detained, that is to say, their

10

physical freedom, to move about and to move out of the

11

presence of the officer had been restricted.
And I think where you have an entire factory to

12
13

move around in, it is a far different circumstance than

14

where you simply have no where to go at all to get away

15

from the presence of the officer, and you are relying

16

entirely, as the other side has argued in their brief is

17

enough, you are relying entirely on the willingness of the

18

officer to walk away from you because you can't go

19

anywhere.

20
21

22

I think it is a very, very different
circumstance.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ayer, I thought you said earlier,

23

I thought you acknowledged earlier that it is not the

24

confinement; it is only the confinement by reason of

25

authority, so that the mere fact that you are on a bus or

anymore than the fact that you are on an elevator doesn't

2

make it an arrest.
So to be sure, he may only be able to move three

3
4

seats away, but so long as he can move three seats away

5

and there is no force or threat of force that prevents him

6

from moving that distance or further, I don't see why it

7

is an arrest, why it is a seizure.
MR. AYER:

8
9

Number one, I don't see how he could

move even three seats away here.

But in any event, if I

10

understand the argument you are making, Justice Scalia, it

11

would suggest that if there is a building that has for

12

some reason a little nook that has three walls and

13

somebody is leaning against the wall sunning himself and

14

the nook is only 2 feet wide and an officer walks up to

15

him and blocks the way out, and says, I want to talk to

16

you —

17

QUESTION:

Oh, no.

If the officer is blocking

18

the way out, that is restricting his movement by force or

19

threat of force.

But if an officer in an elevator, the man

MR. AYER:

3

I would agree with that.

I would

agree that one would not be seized in that circumstance.

I think on the other hand — on the other hand I

5

think here, where the officers have boarded the bus, and

6

they have approached someone who is in the back of the bus

7

and they have acted in a way that they should know, and

8

really must know, communicates a sense of their control,

9

that they have to take responsibility for that.

That they

10

can't say, as is argued, you chose to put yourself on the

11

bus.

12

QUESTION:

That is a good point.

I am not

MR. AYER:

If the police go out of their way to

passengers, occurrence of an officer coming on a bus, that

And if the Florida Supreme Court

would not accept that, you think it is wrong?
MR. AYER:

I think that is going too far, Your

Honor.
Thank you, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

Mr. Ayer.

Ms. Fowler, do you have rebuttal?

minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOAN FOWLER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. FOWLER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would like to reemphasize the fact that these
officers spoke to Mr. Bostick in normal conversational
tones.

They at no time raised their voices.
The gun was not drawn at any time.

QUESTION:

I take it, you think that the Florida

Supreme Court based its ruling on the particular
circumstances of this case:

The fact of the gun, the fact

of blocking the aisle.
Whereas, if those facts hadn't been present,
they would have had a different view?
MS. FOWLER:

No, Justice White.

I think that you are correct in saying that the
Supreme Court of Florida has held a —

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia, please.

MS. FOWLER:

I am sorry, Justice Scalia.

That

5

there was the per se rule that under no circumstances can

6

police go on buses to discuss with citizens, to ask their

7

cooperation for a search for any type of contraband.

8

we are saying here today that that bright line rule, that

9

test should not be the test.

And

10

Also, we are saying that under the specific

11

facts of Bostick, that there was no show of authority

12

sufficient to restrain his liberty, so as to implicate the

13

Fourth Amendment.

14

The aisle was not blocked.

Mr. Bostick's

15

counsel has gotten up here and repeatedly said that the

16

aisle was blocked.

could still have gotten past —

It was partially blocked.

We are a little bit in the dark about

some of the facts, are we not, Ms. Fowler?

Mr. Bostick

Yes, we are.
In view of the — the trial court did

MS. FOWLER:

Yes.

Those facts are sufficient, I

Therefore, we don't have to get into any

is evidence that he was not.

It could have still be opened.

to do is push it.

like that.

There is no

That would be a fire hazard

Would you know how to open it?
My understanding is, all you have

There is no specific levers or anything

A mere pushing is sufficient.

18

And under Delgado, this Court has found that it

19

is not a test of whether or not you are free to leave, it

20

is whether or not you are free to go about your business.

21

And Mr. Bostick's business was staying on the bus to

continue his travels, and he did not have to talk to these

officers if he did not want to.

Thank you.
