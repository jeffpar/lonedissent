CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case concerns the duty of fair

12

representation this Court has implied from the Railway

13

Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act.

14

particular it concerns the end of a long and bitter strike

15

well-chronicled in the press between the Air Line Pilots

16

Association and Continental Airlines and its Chief

17

Executive, Mr. Lorenzo.

18

In

The strike began in '83 after — 1983 after

19

Continental went into bankruptcy and abrogated the

20

collective bargaining agreement between the parties.

21

the events here concern the situation in August,

22

September, and October of 1985.

23

was faced with the following facts of life.

24

substantial expense and unstinting effort, the union had

25

failed to significantly affect Continental's business.

And

At that point, the union

One, despite

1

Secondly, Continental at that point had 1,600 working

2

pilots, either permanent replacements or crossovers, and

3

there were 1,000 strikers.
Third, Continental, in recognition of that, had

4
5

withdrawn recognition of the union.

Fourth, Continental

6

had put out what was called its 85-5 vacancy bid which

7

would have tied up all the most desireable jobs in the air

8

line, the captain and first officer jobs, for the

9

foreseeable future.

And finally, insofar as strikers had

10

bid for those jobs, Continental had sued to. invalidate

11

those bids as fraudulent.

12

Against that background, the union, after

13

internal meetings and discussions, authorized the

14

negotiation of the a settlement.

15

given the difficulties to only be expected in such a

16

bitter strike and with such a large company, the

17

settlement proceeded under the auspices of the bankruptcy

18

court, which had jurisdiction over Continental at that

19

point.

20

document emerged called the Order and Award which is in

21

the joint appendix.

22

QUESTION:

Call the what award?

MR. GOLD:

Order and Award.

1

all but two of its terms were negotiated between the

2

parties, but it was under the auspices of the court.

3

Court had attempted as part of the reorganization as far

4

back as July to get the parties to settle this dispute,

5

because it was an obstacle to reorganization.

6

it was in this October period that the union came forward.

And finally

7
8

The court had also indicated that it wanted, if

9

it was going to put its efforts into it, to have

10

authorized representatives and to have a binding

11

conclusion to the matter.

12

the union's interest as the negotiators saw it, because of

13

the grave distrust between the parties.

14

substantial matter to the union that whatever was

15

concluded would be enforceable, because, as I say, the

16

level of distrust between Mr. Lorenzo and ALPA was

17

substantial at the time.

18

And that, too, was very much in

It was a

QUESTION:

But not arbitrariness?

6

MR. GOLD:

Not arbitrariness in the sense that

7

the court of appeals understood arbitrariness.
The district court, after extensive discovery

8
9

and on the union's motion for summary judgment, concluded

10

that there's nothing to indicate that the union made any

11

choice other than on the best deal that the union thought

12

it could construct and on that view of the standard to be

13

applied determined that summary judgment was appropriate.

14

On appeal, the court of appeals disagreed on two

15

grounds.

First, the court of appeals took the position

16

that the duty of fair representation goes not only to the

17

union's bona fides, but also provides for judicial review

18

of the substance of the union's action.

19

it, union actions must be based on relevant, permissible

20

factors and must be a rational result of such factors, as

21

rational was determined either by a judge or a jury.

22

And the court of appeals determined that a

As the court put

23

finder of fact could find that the agreement put members

24

in a substantially worse position than if no settlement

25

had been made and the strike had been abandoned and

1

individuals had made unconditional offers to return.

2

In addition, the court —

3

QUESTION:

But would you think that that was

4

within the district court's finding that the union got the

5

best deal it could?

6

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

Including no deal, in effect — just

8

abandoning the strike?
MR. GOLD:

9

Is that clear?

I'm not sure.

The -- well, we believe that the

10

court of appeals' opinions said that the union proceeded

11

on an honest, good-faith determination that this was the

12

best way to proceed and that that satisfied the standard.

13

The court of appeals, on the other hand as we understand

14

it, and this is the line of demarkation, said that the

15

court of -- the trier of fact should have determined

16

whether this deal was good enough when compared with what

17

would have happened hypothetically in the event that the

18

union had made an unconditional offer to return to work.

19

QUESTION:

The best way to proceed taking into

20

account what?

21

the power of the union that would have occurred from

22

unconditionally giving in after a long strike and bitter

23

strike?

Is there a wade into that, the damage to

union was allowed to take into account?

2

MR. GOLD:

As we understand the court of

3

appeals' decision, the host of uncertainties and the

4

nature of the factors that are to — I'm sorry, the role

5

of the host of uncertainties that the union and the

6

striking pilots faced and the calculus of factors that are

7

to be taken into account are both disregarded.

8

know from reading the court of appeals' opinion what goes

9

into this calculus.

10

We don't

And that is one of our prime

concerns.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what do you think for purposes

12

of a good-faith test which you are urging?

13

into account for good faith the fact that the union was

14

looking to its national power and how that would be eroded

15

by losing a strike of this sort that had gone on for 2

16

years and was so bitter?

17

determined solely on the basis of what was good for the

18

members of this bargaining unit?

19

MR. GOLD:

Do you take

Or is good faith to be

Well, it seems to us that if we reach

20

that point, and there does not seem in this case to be any

21

evidence opposing that conundrum, that the union is

entitled to take into account the — the total situation

What I started

1

total situation facing pilots overall, including the

2

striking pilots, who have a calling, have a skill, and

3

will only get on in the labor market for that calling and

4

skill what the union is able to do, that would be a

5

legitimate consideration.

6

Now where one would come out if the union was

7

firmly of the view that it would advance the situation of

8

A and B somewhere else while harming these people, I find

9

a much more difficult question.

But I do think that, in a

10

world in which you have competition in the product and

11

service markets for the union be forced to look only at

12

the situation of the particular unit, as if it was a

13

discrete entity, when in fact it isn't, would be to —

14

wouldn't be to further the notion the court of appeals

15

had, mainly a rationality standard.

16

require the union to proceed in a way that is irrational.

It would be to

anything in this case.

20

The Continental system appeared to proceed and took their

view as they were trying to get the best deal that they

could get, not the best deal for — in a different and

23

wider perspective.

1

scrutiny.

We believe that the duty of fair

2

representation, as the Court said in Steele, is a duty to

3

act in behalf of all those for whom it acts without

4

hostile, namely irrelevant or invidious, discrimination

5

against them.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, the court of appeals used

7

the word "arbitrary."

8

arbitrary has no place in the test or that they simply

9

misunderstood the meaning of the word arbitrary?

10

MR. GOLD:

Do you say that the — that

We believe that they misunderstood

11

the meaning of the word arbitrary.

12

brief starting on page 14, the court has used different

13

formulations to delineate the scope of the duty of fair

14

representation, and the court

15

in doing so.

16

the cases is that arbitrary in that sense means hostile

17

action against an individual or a subgroup of the

18

bargaining force.

19

As we detail in our

has used the word arbitrary

We believe that the fairest reading of all

In other words, the union generally processes

20

grievances by doing certain preliminary steps.

An

21

individual shows that without any justification, any

22

reason, the union doesn't do those things for him and he

23

is harmed.

24

it adds something to the concept of discriminatory,

25

because discrimination, certainly as it was used in

We would think that that is arbitrary and that

11

1

Steele, has a notion of a class-based wrong.

2

So what we would suggest is that this test is a

3

test of good faith and honesty of purpose as the Court

4

said in Ford Motor and that what arbitrary means is that

5

discrimination, which is either class based or is simply

6

inexplicable and harmful, is a wrong.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gold, that was going to be

8

my question.

9

circumstances, say, in the legal profession, would be

Suppose the union commits what in other

10

malpractice.

very good faith.

It misses a grievance deadline.

It — now is there liability there?

MR. GOLD:

12

But it's in

No, the essence of our argument is

13

that this duty doesn't create a liability for honest

14

mistakes, so —

15

QUESTION:

So we're talking here about a

16

standard that applies across the board, administration of

17

the contract, grievances, routine procedures, as well as

18

the more complex context of conducting bargaining?

19

MR. GOLD:

Well, we make three different

20

arguments in support of our position that the court of

21

appeals was wrong here.

22

stated.

23

honesty and good purpose ought to apply in the most

24

complex situations, namely the negotiation of agreements

25

or the renegotiation of agreements even if it doesn't

1

apply in what are arguably simpler cases involving

2

grievance handling.

3

And third, we argue that the court of appeals

4

was certainly wrong in terms of the way it understood

5

whatever duty of adequate representation that exists, that

6

instead of looking at the matter in terms of the practical

7

and legal uncertainties at the time, looking at the

8

situation that actually faced the union, and looking also

9

at the fact that the ultimate agreement provided for

10

benefits for the striking employees such as, severance pay,

11

recall in seniority order, and so on that were not legally

12

required, that this was not an agreement which was -- is

13

challengeable even under a duty of care.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I — on duty of care, you'll

15

recall from the Rawson case where the union allegedly

16

negligently contributed to the death of mine workers, we

17

said that the union could not be sued under State law.

18

And now you're saying there's a broad immunity based on a

19

good-faith standard under Federal law.

I know of —

20

MR. GOLD:

Well, basically —

21

QUESTION:

I know of no parallel in all of the

22

law, other than for sovereign immunity, which gives an

23

immunity that tests — is that extensive.

24
25

MR. GOLD:

The -- as we understand Rawson,

Justice Kennedy, the Court also said that a negligence

1

claim would not be actionable under the duty of fair

2

representation.

3

- there would be an actionable State law claim.

4

the standard is certainly, from what we know from this

5

Court's cases, higher than negligence.

It was not simply that it would not be -

QUESTION:

6

So that

But our --

Mr. Gold, I had really thought that

7

our cases had spoken in terms of a reasonableness

8

component to the arbitrary standard here and that you

9

would have us read that out of the standard and limit it

10

to negotiations or actions taken in bad faith or with

11

hostility.

12

law for that kind of a limitation, or don't we find that

13

the arbitrary component of Vaca against Sipes' standard

14

imports some degree of reasonableness inquiry?

15

Now, do you really find support in our case

MR. GOLD:

Well, if I can, there are two things

16

I'd like to say about that.

17

to develop in our reply brief, the wide range of

18

reasonableness language is in Ford Motor Company — this

19

is at pages 2 to 4 of our reply brief.

20

there was to determine whether a distinction between

21

veterans or nonveterans was a distinction which was

22

invidious and irrelevant or relevant to the union's task.

23

So the reasonableness was in setting up the

24

classifications.

25

First of all, as we attempt

And the context

As we point out, the Court did not go on to see

(800) FOR DEPO

1

whether veterans got too much seniority or too little; and

2

we certainly acknowledge that, in terms of drawing

3

distinctions, there is a reasonableness component.

4

The second point I would like to make is that

5

the Lockridge case which is the last case which fully

6

explores the nature of this duty, like Steele, which was

7

the first case, talks entirely in terms of honesty and

8

good faith.

9

In terms of why there should be such a duty, if

10

I could in — given Justice Kennedy's question, we believe

11

that the answer is that this is a statutory duty, and it

12

comes out of a statute whose overriding function was to

13

take judges and juries out of the substance of labor

14

relations and to put those tasks into the hands the

15

parties.

16

Senator Walsh's famous statement there that the act takes

17

the parties to the negotiating table and leaves them

18

there.

19

We discuss and cite the H.K. Porter case and

To have judges and juries saying this deal is

20

not good enough, even though it was honest, even though it

21

was based on a fair judgment of the circumstances and that

22

you had to do it a different way is to get —

MR. GOLD:

— that standard, but we're —

11

QUESTION:

You mean judges are supposed to

12

decide whether they were fair or not?
MR. GOLD:

13

Well, no.

We are arguing that that

14

is precisely what labor relations is not about.

15

a lot of mean, unfair deals out there when you take into

16

account that the company had the power and the union had

17

less .

18

QUESTION:

There are

Oh, it — you don't really — you've

19

been living — the unions have been living with this Vaca

standard for a long time, and I have noticed in all the

cases that come around here that you've been really hurt

Now, that's a — that's a — that isn't looking

over the shoulders of the union or really second guessing

you.

4

MR. GOLD:

not the view — the view you just stated is certainly not

this case.

11

QUESTION:

That may be.

But haven't you been

living with the arbitrariness standard interpreted in that
way for a long time?
MR. GOLD:

We have been living with a regime

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTY HARPER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11

MR. HARPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

We are here on a court of appeals reversal of

13

summary judgment, and in analyzing this case, we cannot

14

overlook that fact.

15

in reversing the district court, correctly applied the

16

summary judgment standards of the Fifth Circuit and of

17

this Court.

18

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,

In addition, in analyzing the union's conduct,

19

the Fifth Circuit court of appeals applied the three-

20

prong standard set forth in Vaca v. Sipes, which has been

21

around and the unions have been dealing with for 24 years.

22

What the union wants to do today is to convince the Court

23

to change the law so that it can avoid liability to 1,400

24

striking pilots who remained out on strike for 2 years.

What do you think the word

"arbitrary" suggests to courts of appeals?

supposed just to say, well, the union is guilty or is

MR. HARPER:

14

What arbitrary means I believe,

Your Honor, is simply the question as to whether a

Your Honor, and try to find out and look at what the

relevant factors were that the union officials considered

QUESTION:

But this —
How's that any different than

negligence?
MR. HARPER:

It's a higher standard, Your Honor,

than negligence.
QUESTION:

Well, you say so.

But how do you

13

distinguish between a negligently conducted negotiation

14

and an arbitrary one?

15

MR. HARPER:

You have to look at the factors,

16

Your Honor, that went into the conduct that the union

17

followed and look at the actual circumstances that were

18

taken into consideration which were going to be numerous,

and then balance to see if the decision was made based

upon a rational consideration of those factors.

2

the two.

3

I find it very, very difficult to distinguish

MR. HARPER:

Those are difficult items to

4

distinguish, Your Honor, and what we are dealing with is a

5

continuum of arbitrariness, and there comes a point in

6

time like in the Rawson case where this Court has decided

7

that an allegation based upon pure negligence is not

8

sufficient to staying a breach of duty of fair

9

representation.

But an allegation based upon conduct that

10

is more serious than that, not taking into consideration

11

relevant factors, and then moving off and making the

12

decision that's not based upon those factors, it's

13

arbitrary, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Mr. Harper, would you standard

15

require detailed examination of how the union officials

16

went about reaching this agreement?

That opens up, I presume, just, you know, what went on at

the meetings of the officials who were given the

20

responsibility for trying to settle the thing.

Mr. Chief Justice, it would require

2

demonstrate whether or not the decision was based upon a

3

consideration of those factors.
In this case, what has happened, Your Honor, is

5

many of the arguments that have been advanced here to

justify what the union did are post hoc arguments of

counsel.

9

QUESTION:

What if a court reviewing the union's

conduct feels, yes, the union considers all — considered

10

all the factors that it said it was going to consider.

11

But in the view of the court there was a factor that it

12

should have considered but didn't.

13

MR. HARPER:

Your Honor, the court does not

14

substitute as judgment for that and if you go back to the

15

case here, the O'Neill case, and look at the basis upon

16

which the Fifth Circuit rendered its opinion, which is the

17

Tedford opinion, you will find exactly that sort of

18

analysis in the Tedford opinion.

19

there are a couple of judgments that the union officials

20

could have made.

21

to say we are not going to select whether or not it was

22

correct for the union to do one or the other.

23

going to do is to analyze that the decision that was made

24

— to ensure it was based upon relevant factors and that

25

the judgment was based upon relevant factors.

In the Tedford opinion,

The court of appeals went out of its way

And if a court says we see a factor

would allow it to set aside the decision?

MR. HARPER:

The trier of fact may find that in

the totality of the circumstances, the union didn't act

it made.

Which is certainly more a — that's a

— that gives them a' lot more room than insisting that

MR. HARPER:

these union officials to consider relevant facts and make

the union didn't consider, shouldn't they also ask, well,

would any rational person — could any rational person

have put those factors aside?
MR. HARPER:

13

That's a relevant consideration

when you evaluate at the trial level the conduct of the

union.

that its meaning here in reviewing union action is about

5

the same as its meaning in reviewing agency action under

6

the Administrative Procedure Act?

7

MR. HARPER:

Do you think

I think it's very close to that,

8

Your Honor.

In those types of considerations, you look

9

at, if, for example, an agent -- head of an agency has

10

changed a policy and in order to have that act

11

substantiated, there has to be some explanation, for

12

fundamentally the same sort of analysis that we think is

appropriate here.

MR. HARPER:

It does not appear from the record,

QUESTION:

So it's not critical for us to decide

whether this was a worse deal than a return to —

5

MR. HARPER:

6

QUESTION:

But it is critical to decide whether

7

they considered it.

And is it your position on that that

8

the record is absolutely clear based on admissions by the

9

union that they didn't or a total absence of evidence of

10

any discussion of it?

11

MR. HARPER:

Absolutely not.

Your Honor, based upon the record

12

as we developed it through deposition testimony and

13

through the gleaning of notes and records that the

14

negotiators that we were entitled to depose, they did not

15

consider at that critical point in time the unconditional

offer to return to work.

17

I'd like to point out to the Court —

18

QUESTION:

But I'm asking you do you say that

19

because there's a failure of — in absence of any evidence

showing they did discuss it or is there evidence of an

admission that they did not discuss it?

MR. HARPER:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And are you satisfied — going back

to Justice White's question, would you be satisfied if the

Court stopped at saying this is one possible result within

the realm of reasonableness so that if that test were

satisfied, that would be the extent of the Court's

scrutiny?

And if it's one possible result

based upon a — the analysis that we have urged the Court,

12

and if the — that determination then is that it's

nonarbitrary because of the process that went through,

then the results would be okay.

MR. HARPER:

It may not be, Your Honor, because

the problem with that is that that craft or class becomes

risk, if they don't have this broad duty of fair

So you say the reasonable factors

MR. HARPER:

And what benefits them and what the

QUESTION:

The union cannot make a sort of

command decision, saying we realize we're not doing very

well by the Continental pilots and we could do better, but

12

the long-run interest of the airline pilots we represent

with all the other airlines would be served by this deal

that doesn't do very well for Continental?

Those are considerations that the

Well, okay, but answer a hypothetical

The union decides that the proposed deal we're

Can it do that?

Not to the detriment of the craft

Yes, I do, Your Honor.
Well, that test is a three-part test

2

they have a free wheeling — they can just decide whether

3

it's fair or not, is that it?

MR. HARPER:

No.

Non-arbitrary?

It's part of the three-step

5

procedure and analysis that the Tedford court requires,

6

and in this case the results are evident, Your Honor, that

7

the conduct was arbitrary because it was worse than an

8

unconditional offer to return to work.

9

QUESTION:

Well, literally, this test means that

10

the union — even if the union took — considered all

11

relevant factors and gave rational consideration to it,

12

nevertheless, they might be unfair, an unfair result.

13

MR. HARPER:

In this case, the result — I don't

14

know if it's unfair, Your Honor, but it has been

15

characterized by the chief pilot negotiator as beyond what

16

was reasonable, has been characterized by him as

17

bastardizing forever the seniority system, and has been

18

characterized by the district court as being atrocious.

Now if that's the same as being unfair, then those are the

20

ways it has been characterized.

MR. GOLD:

It seems to me that the last point Mr. Harper

MR. GOLD:

It is on both the arbitrariness of

relied on a very expansive reading of Erie Resistor, which
