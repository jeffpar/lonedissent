MR. KEADLE:

Mr. Chief Justice — Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

1

We'll hear argument

Arkansas law provides for gross receipts tax of

14

general applicability to sales of all tangible personal

15

property in Arkansas in certain services.

16

provides for certain enumerated exceptions, one being an

17

exception for sale of newspapers.

18

tax has been applied to sale of cable television services,

19

and in 1989 the gross receipts tax law was amended to add

20

to the sales tax the service of descrambling of satellite

21

services provided to home dish owners.

22

The — since 1987 the

The same general gross receipts tax is applied

petitioners in 90-39, have challenged the Arkansas tax

2

because an exemption, as is extended to newspapers, is not

3

also extended to the sale of cable television service,

4

citing that there is a similarity between the two

5

services.

The law does not in fact violate the First

The taxpayer would have

The Supreme Court of Arkansas, Mr.

19

Keadle, said that the tax was invalid insofar as it

applied to cable TV operators but did not extend to

21

satellite dish operators?
MR. KEADLE:

22

23

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

correct.

2

QUESTION:

And

3

then you're defending the ruling of the Supreme Court of

4

Arkansas when it held that it was not invalid to

distinguish between cable operators and newspapers?

6

MR. KEADLE:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Is the satellite issue still in the

case?

You're appealing that ruling?

It seems —

Okay.

basis of our argument is —

that it was not invalid prior to amendment?

1

Your Honor, we are arguing that the tax as it stood in

2

1987 was constitutional due to the fact that, although

3

evidence was presented that these two media provided

4

similar types of services, that there was a difference in

5

the two media that would justify the different, different

6

tax treatment.

V

7

QUESTION:

How much is involved in that interim

8

period, between 1987 and 1989?

9

MR. KEADLE:

Between 1987 and 1989, at the time

10

the taxes were escrowed in the case it was approximately

11

$6.2 million.

12

Court ruled in the case, the respondents went back into

13

court and asked that the escrow account be reestablished.

At present, after the Arkansas Supreme

Instead an agreement was reached between the parties

15

whereby the State would reserve an amount in one of its

16

refund accounts to compensate for the $6.2 million plus

17

accumulated interest.

18

somewhere around $8.1 to $8.5 million.
QUESTION:

19

I believe now it stands at

And if this Court were to reverse the

20

Supreme Court of Arkansas and say that the statute in

21

effect before the legislative amendment went into effect

22

was constitutional, the State would recover some money,

23

then?

24

MR. KEADLE:

25

escrow in that sense.

Well, Your Honor, it is not a true
There is not — it's more rather

1

that the State would not have to make that refund out of

2

its existing refund accounts.

3

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

So that, that is the

4

tangible dispute, whether the State has to refund taxes

5

that it collected?

6

MR. KEADLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

On one hand there

7

will be a refund of taxes collected prior to the 1989

8

change, and in the other instance the tax is ongoing.

9

There will be a request for refund of that money, too.

10

As I had stated before, there is really no First

11

Amendment violation in terms of treating two like entities

12

differently for tax purposes —

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, is that because they don't

compete?

15

MR. KEADLE:

Well, Your Honor, in some sense

16

they do compete for viewer dollars, consumer dollars.

17

It's more of a fact that physically they are different

19

In the cable situation you have a process —
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose we can tell when —

20

you can read a newspaper, and you watch a television

21

screen.

22

But for purposes of our determining the scope of the First

23

Amendment, can't we say that these media are in

24

competition?

25

news broadcasts in Arkansas, including 24-hour news, I

They're dissimilar in that — in that respect.

suppose, on some channels?
MR. KEADLE:

2

Your Honor, I think it's clear that

3

in fact evidence presented at the trial showed that many

4

of the types of programs that cable offered were indeed

5

similar to those provided by newspaper.

6

difference here is in the physical make up of the two

7

services and how does this burden on the Government to -QUESTION:

8

9

But the

Well, but didn't the Arkansas Supreme

Court say that there was no competition between the two,

10

or am I wrong about that?

11

Court said well, we — they're not really competing in the

12

same way.
MR. KEADLE:

13
14

I thought the Arkansas Supreme

That is between cable and

newspaper?

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KEADLE:

Yes.
Yes.

That statement was made, and

17

that is what is at issue here.

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Was that based on some factual

findings?
MR. KEADLE:

Well, I think it was more a review

21

of past cases of this Court that had not necessarily made

22

the distinction between cable and newspapers as being

23

competing interests, even though, even though the evidence

24

presented was they are similar types of programs.

25

are still different — different entities.

QUESTION:
of the law?

Mr. Keadle, what, what is your theory

Do you acknowledge that it is contrary to the

First Amendment to tax differentially two media that are
in competition with one another?

That the test is whether

they are competing, and if they are competing, you cannot
tax one differently from the other?
Is that a —

in the determination, but —

Well, what is the

I mean, that one I

What is it if it's not that?

MR. KEADLE:

Well, the criterion that the State

is arguing and that we're looking at is the type of burden
that is placed on the Government by the two types of
services.

certain aspects that you have in cable, like the stringing

of the cable along the public rights-of-way on wires,

2

underground, the basic interference with the Government

function, and also —

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's a difference between the

5

two, and there are a lot of other differences between the

6

two.

7

other tax, a rational basis distinction between the two is

8

enough to support a differential tax?

9

So I — is what you're saying is that, as with any

MR. KEADLE:

Yes, Your Honor.

When we are

10

dealing with a tax that is not content based or does not

11

— and where the similarity between the two comes into

12

play is when you're not dealing with two similar enough

13

entities to make that distinction, then you do use the

14

rational basis test.

15

QUESTION:

So it's just the same test that

16

applies to all taxation?

17

between the two, you say, so long as you're not

18

discriminating on a subject matter basis?

19

MR. KEADLE:

There has to be a rational basis

That's correct, and I believe this

Project case —

QUESTION:

Yes, but what about a tax on ink and

typesetting?

has also stated that an effect on a newspaper, that

particular — that particular example in the Minneapolis
Star case, that when you examine it and see that the
effect is had only on a few members of the press, in that
case a small group, a use tax on publishers, rather that
it was shown —
QUESTION:

Yeah, but surely there was a rational

basis to distinguish publishers from other people.

I

mean, they're different from other people in a lot of
ways.

They put different burdens on the State's economy,

and so forth.

Wasn't there a rational basis there to

distinguish between?

I mean, I want to tax ink, and I

don't want to tax non-ink.

Ink is different from non­

ink.
MR. KEADLE:

Your Honor, I believe there was a

rational basis there —
QUESTION:
MR. KEADLE:

But we struck it down anyway.
The Court struck it down because

the tax in effect targeted a small group within one
entity.
QUESTION:

In other words a group within an

entity that was competing with each other.

So we're right

back where you say we aren't.
MR. KEADLE:

Well, in effect it was the same

entity.

MR. KEADLE:

It was the same entity, as opposed

to competing entities.
QUESTION:

The same as opposed to competing?

The same in what sense?

5

MR. KEADLE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KEADLE:

The same in the sense that -They're different newspapers.
-- the tax was on publishers.

Yes,

8

they're different newspapers, but they are newspapers.

9

They are a member of the print media, and the distinction

10

we're making here is they're two different types of media.

11

They are competing, but the differences are physical.

12

QUESTION:

So in one-half of the case it depends

13

on whether scrambled television systems are really the

14

same media as unscrambled television systems, is that's

15

your criterion, right?

16

whether they are like two different newspapers or not?

17

MR. KEADLE:

That's the question before us,

Well, Your Honor, I believe in that

18

situation you can actually distinguish between the

19

satellite service and the cable TV. service in that — in

20

that basically the way the program is received in the

21

home, in one instance, satellite service, can be

22

distinguished from cable.

beamed directly into the home and there is not, there is

May I ask, don't the newspapers use

distinction?

still there.

Well, I believe the distinction is

14

QUESTION:

Of course they pay for the

franchises, don't they?
MR. KEADLE:

Well, Your Honor, it's true there

15

is some payment for the franchise, but I don't think it's

16

clear also that that is necessarily full compensation for

17

that service.

20

QUESTION:

But isn't it true the newspapers

don't pay anything for the newsstands on public property?
MR. KEADLE:

That's true, Your Honor, and that

21

may — and the distinction there may well be more of a

22

basis upon how administratively easy it is to collect the

23

tax from newspapers as opposed to cable.

evidence in the case shows that the collection of tax

QUESTION:

Yeah, but administration of a sales

7

tax on newspapers probably isn't any harder than sales tax

8

on candy bars, is it?

9

MR. KEADLE:

Your Honor, that may well be true.

10

I know that that is a distinction the Court, has brought

11

out at times, specifically, I believe, your concurring

12

opinion in the Minneapolis Star case, that based a

13

distinction that there is at least some administrative

14

inconvenience in collecting the tax of newspapers.

15

Admittedly, maybe it's similar to others, but that

16

distinction has been made.

QUESTION:

In Arkansas, what do — what public

property does the — do the cable companies use?
MR. KEADLE:

Well, in effect they use both, both

20

the wires, the wires and underground conduits.

21

use of the public streets to lay these — lay these wires.

22

And that not only — not only causes problems necessarily

23

in traffic and other means, but there is actually a

24

physical use of phone wires —

MR. KEADLE:

1

Yes.

Yes, they do.

I think in

2

Arkansas both methods of using the above ground poles and

3

underground conduits are used.

4

QUESTION:

Did the Arkansas Supreme Court find

5

that cable television pays a franchise fee for the use of

6

the public right-of-way?

7

MR. KEADLE:

8

QUESTION:

9

Your Honor, I believe that —
I thought that was included in their

findings?
MR. KEADLE:

10

Your Honor, that was, indeed

11

mentioned in the findings, but I would submit that that

12

finding is not completely correct, given the fact that

13

this Court in the Preferred Communications case has at

14

least sent that case back down for more evidence on how

15

that fee is collected and how it is used.
QUESTION:

16
17

So you don't support the opinion of

the court below on that point, is that it?

18

MR. KEADLE:

Your Honor, I believe that the

19

evidence that we have can allow us to make a decision

20

without necessarily addressing that portion.

21

to say that I do recognize that there is a franchise fee

22

paid and what it goes to.

Therefore they rejected the public rights-

QUESTION:

Mr. Keadle, I suppose the State of

Arkansas can impose a tax on candy and not impose a tax on

ice cream if it wanted to, couldn't it?

6

MR. KEADLE:

7

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I would think so.
And you wouldn't have to show that

8

candy used public facilities or the public streets more

9

than ice cream or anything of that sort?

10

MR. KEADLE:

11

QUESTION:

12

You'd just come up here and you'd say

candy is different from ice cream, right?

17

MR. KEADLE:

Well, the difference in the two

examples, one being the candy and the other being the

scrambled satellite services is to what extent the

21

respondents' First Amendment rights are being violated.

1

taxation is such that it puts a burden on the State to

2

show a higher or the' compelling interest.

3

And in this particular case we believe that the

4

taxpayers and the cable operators have sufficiently

5

established that the method of delivering news information

6

and entertainment by the cable electronic message is

7

exactly the same as that that is delivered in the print,

8

either newspapers or magazines, and in fact the trial

9

court stated that our witnesses referred to this as an

10
11

electronic magazine.
Now the method, or the relief that we're seeking

12

is a reversal of the latter part of the decision and an

13

affirmance of the first part.

14

Arkansas Supreme — legislature amended the law because we

15

had established at the trial in this case that the direct

16

broadcast satellite, or the scrambled services, were not

being taxed and were delivering exactly the same type of

information, news and entertainment, virtually identical,

19

to the cable that was taxed, that for that 2-year period

that we have suggested, and that is that print and the
cable are similar, sufficiently similar, that the same tax

3

should be applied to the same or they are unconstitutional

4

without a compelling interest being shown by the State,

5

then you should reverse the Arkansas Supreme Court on the

6

approval of the second or amended law.

7

However, even if you find that only the

8

electronic media is similar and that we should narrow the

9

approach or the look to those particular entities, we have

10

submitted the affidavits in the petition for rehearing

11

simply to establish that there is a factual difference.

12

The Supreme Court of Arkansas noted twice in the opinion

13

that the Act 769 was not before the trial court, and did
not pass upon it.

1

And therefore we submit that even if

15

the Court should narrow the limitation of the view in this

case, that we should be entitled on remand — the Court

17

should vacate and we should be entitled on remand to

MR. SAYRE:

3

Because of, as this Court stated in

4

the Minneapolis Star case, it offers the incentive for the

5

legislature to act as a carrot and a stick, to play one

6

media off against the other, to offer if you change your

7

viewpoint we'll take the tax off or we'll exempt you.

8

That potential exists.

9

there, it's not just what the tax is being imposed here,

10

but it's the — perhaps the promise or the potential for

other differential taxes —

MR. SAYRE:

Do you think the congressional

No, no.

The licensing and franchising of the

Mr. Sayre, in your response to one of

Yes.
That case is mentioned by one or two

of the amicus curiae.

It isn't cited, as far as I can

tell, in either your briefs or your opponent's briefs.

10

you have any comment, further comment, about the Reagan

case?

Doesn't it give you some trouble?
MR. SAYRE:

MR. SAYRE:

that it is not in the same line as the Minneapolis Star or

Mr. Sayre, could Arkansas exempt not-

But they are exacting a charge for it.

MR. SAYRE:

The basic principle for the

exemption of any charitable organization is they're

supplying a service or some need that the State would

5

otherwise have to supply.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SAYRE:

And in this particular —

That's a compelling State interest?
That would be a consideration of a

8

compelling State interest, but that is what I'm stating is

9

the reason that the courts in Arkansas at least have held

10

that the tax-exempt or charitable organizations may be

11

exempt from tax.

Now, in the —

QUESTION:

Why doesn't that offend the principle

of freedom of the press?

That's correct.
It's to ensure open discussion.

What's the difference whether the discussion is by a not-

MR. SAYRE:

Well, in this particular instance I

would say it would simply be the delivery of — if it's

confined and limited purpose, it perhaps is sufficient to

2

rise to a compelling need.

3

On the other hand, in Arkansas the

4

municipalities that operate a cable system are required to

5

impose the sales tax in the same manner that a private

6

organization is required to.

7

Now, the other courts that have considered this

8

question, the State courts that have considered this

9

question, have more broadly applied this Court's rationale

10

in Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writer's Project than has

11

the Arkansas Supreme Court.

12

stated that its only reason for not more broadly applying

13

it with regard to the print and the cable entities was

14

because it found no case of this Court that had required

15

the same type of taxation.

16

case and the McGraw-Hill case in New York, the courts did

17

apply broadly to both the print and the electronic media

18

the same standards, and they said that again the burden,

19

because of this policy decision of this Court, is upon the

20

State to show a compelling interest, which it did not.

21

The Arkansas Supreme Court

In the Oklahoma Broadcasters'

And that is the test that we're urging this

22

Court to apply in both the first and second parts of this

23

case, to find that the print media and the cable media are

24

similarly situated, delivering the same message, and

25

therefore should be taxed in the same manner.

And if

1

they're not, if the State fails to show a compelling or

2

substantial interest, then the tax must be stricken.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question just running

through my mind as a result of one the Chief Justice asked

clients.

Supposing a State imposed an amusement tax on motion

Would that be valid?
MR. SAYRE:

That would certainly be subject to

10

with regard to their particular type of communication, a

11

valid claim that there is a discrimination.

12

the Illinois court held in the satellite link case where

cable was not taxed and the microwave services providing

the same movies were taxed.

would apply in the same manner.

MR. SAYRE:

MR. SAYRE:

Again, the cross-ownership within the medias,

the fact that magazine publishers, newspaper publishers

another sign that these are all part of the same method of

MR. KEADLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

I would take exception to one of Mr. Sayre's

statements made early on that the Arkansas General

Assembly enacted this amendment to the tax because it was

found that satellite television services and cable

services were the same.

no legislative history to indicate that that was indeed

There is nothing in the record,

result.

12

and the Arkansas Supreme Court did not make that

13

determination until after the law was changed.

14

The trial court did not make that determination,

QUESTION:

So —

Well, arguably, I suppose the,

15

changing the law made the exemption of newspapers even

16

more difficult, because satellites don't use the — a

MR. KEADLE:

They're quite different.

In fact

even more so than satellite and cable, due to the fact

MR. KEADLE:

I think the distinction is relevant

would be economically feasible for the State.

3

I would also take exception to Mr.. Sayre's

statement that perhaps this case should be send back on

to make an argument as to the distinction between cable
