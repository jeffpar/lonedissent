ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SLOAN:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the Occupational Safety and

13

Health Act of 1970.

14

comprehensive regime for occupational safety and health.

15

Congress gave the Secretary of Labor the authority to set

16

occupational safety and health standards through issuing

17

regulations, and he gave the Secretary the authority to

18

administer the program through a variety of means,

19

including inspecting businesses and issuing citations for

20

violations of the statute or regulations.

21

In that act Congress established a

At the same time Congress created the

22

Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

23

sole function is to hear challenges to the citations.

24

Commission's decisions, in turn, are reviewable in the

25

courts of appeals.

Its
The

The question in this case is whether,

1

when the Secretary and the Commission disagree about the

2

meaning of the Secretary's regulations, deference should

3

be given to the Secretary or to the Commission.

4

believe that deference should be given to the Secretary

5

because Congress gave the Secretary the authority to make

6

policy through issuing regulations and administering the

7

program, and the ability to provide reasonable

8

interpretations of those regulations is an aspect of that

9

policy-making authority.

10

QUESTION:

We

Mr. Sloan, does that same principle

11

apply to the Commission itself when it decides issues?

12

Does it have to defer to the Secretary's interpretation?

13

MR. SLOAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, it does, Justice O'Connor.
So the error that was made here, in

15

your view, was made at the Commission level by its failure

16

to defer to the Secretary's position?

17

MR. SLOAN:

That's correct.

We believe that the

18

Commission failed to give proper deference to the

19

Secretary's position.

20

that the question should be the same as for the

21

Commission, which is whether the Secretary's

22

interpretation was reasonable.

23

reviewing court should just address that question

24

directly, considering carefully the Commission's opinion

25

and the light that it can shed on that issue, but

For the reviewing court, we believe

And so therefore the

1

basically facing the same question that the Commission was

2

facing.
QUESTION:

3

I'm curious here.

There is a

4

regulation that appears to be more clearly in point for

5

this particular violation, and that was (g)(4)(i), and the

6

Secretary, or the department never amended its complaint

7

to refer to that regulation.

8

the training regulation for the violation.

9

MR. SLOAN:

It chose to rely instead on
Why was that?

The reason for that was that the

10

regulation that was relied on was perfectly appropriate.

11

The particular provision is a training provision, but it

12

has a fitting component.

13

respirators being fitted properly, and it's important --

14

QUESTION:

It specifically refers to

Well, when you rely on the training

15

regulation, it's perhaps ambiguous, or you have to stretch

16

to see how it applies.

17

the other regulation it would seem rather clear, wouldn't

18

it?

19

MR. SLOAN:

But if reliance had been placed on

Well, in terms of some of the

20

objections that have been raised to it, those objections

21

would not be present.

22

23
24
25

But let me address the separate fit provision in
its context.
QUESTION:

Yeah, I just — it seems the present

interpretation would appear to make it duplicative.

You

1

don't even need (g)(4)(i), I guess, in light of the

2

Secretary's reading of the training regulation.

3

MR. SLOAN:

4

QUESTION:

Well, part of the reason -I might say that I share Justice

5

O'Connor's concern as to why an amendment wasn't made, or

6

why you didn't rely on the other provision.

7

MR. SLOAN:

Two -- there are two reasons.

One

8

has to do with (g)(4)(i), and one has to do with (g)(3),

9

which is what incorporates the general respirator

10

provision of section 134.

11

remains of that provision is a vestige of the original

12

provision.

13

Secretary, an entirely different provision.

14

that is there now, which has the language "fitted

15

properly," which is the same phrase that is in section

16

134, "fitted properly," that initially was followed by a

17

specific quantitative fit requirement which is very

18

different from the qualitative fit test which is at issue

19

in this case, the banana oil test where an employee puts

20

on a respirator and is asked if he can detect the smell of

21

the banana oil.

22

quantitative fit test actually measures on a quantitative

23

basis the exposure that the respirator is allowing.

24
25

Taking (g)(4)(i) first, what

It was initially, as promulgated by the

sentence, and it then went on to the quantitative fit

provision.

3

invalidated in the course of litigation within the year

4

and a half previously to this inspection here, which was

5

in August 1979.

6

the first sentence of (g)(4)(i) ultimately, when the

7

Secretary corrected the regulation, kept the first

8

sentence, but it was a very different provision from the

9

one that had initially been there.

The quantitative fit requirement was

terms of the context on (g)(4)(i) -QUESTION:

version was in effect, was it not?

It applies of its

1

when it's incorporated in another regulation, without a

2

sentence as is now in (g)(4)(i).

3

the Secretary has consistently interpreted section 134 to

4

impose a fit requirement, and if the conclusion that

5

section 134 does not impose a fit requirement because of

6

the existence of this separate fit provision in (g)(4)(i),

7

would strip the regulation of an essential part of its

8

meaning, in the Secretary's view, in those other contexts,

9

even though the predicate for doing so, the separate fit

In those circumstances

provision, is not -- is not there.
And the reason that I'm going into this

12

background is to say that section 134, which is

13

incorporated, has a broad applicability, and this is the

14

standard way that it has been interpreted.

15

interpreted to include that fitting component.

16

It has been

The reason I went into the background on

17

(g)(4)(i) is that although the shorter version remained in

18

effect, it had been primarily viewed as the quantitative

19

fit requirement, and it had been viewed that (g)(3), which

20

incorporated section 134, imposed, among other things, a

21

requirement that, as the regulations state, the employee

22

had an opportunity to have the respirator fitted properly,

23

and have an opportunity to have the respirator in a test

24

atmosphere.

25

And so it was a perfectly valid interpretation.

There was no reason to think that it was only covered by

2

(g)(4)(i), and in fact that would be inconsistent with the

3

way section 134 had been interpreted in a wide variety of

other contexts.

In terms

So

Thank you.
As a clerical matter, the second

10

sentence wasn't deleted until somewhat later, but this is

11

what was in effect at the time.

12

I should point out that these questions about

13

the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation are

14

precisely what the court of appeals did not find it

15

necessary to address, because in the court of appeals'

16

view it was sufficient to defer to the Commission's

17

interpretation.

18

In the court of appeals' view in cases of

19

conflict between the Secretary and the Commission, if it

20

determines that the regulation is ambiguous, it defers to

21

the Commission if it finds that the Commission's view is

22

reasonable.

23

ambiguous, found that the Commission's interpretation was

24

reasonable, and never explicitly addressed the

25

reasonableness or not of the Secretary's interpretation.

So the court found that the regulation was

10

1

That is exactly the question that we think should have

2

been addressed by the court and was not.
QUESTION:

3

Are you, therefore, Mr. Sloan, asking

4

us to send the case back so the court can address that

5

question, or are you asking us to decide it?
MR. SLOAN:

6

We think that it would be

7

appropriate to send the case back to address the

8

reasonableness after clarifying the threshold question

9

which has divided the courts of appeals, which is whether

10

deference should be given to the Secretary or to the

11

Commission.

12

not address the question it would be appropriate to send

13

it back to consider it in the first instance.

14

And we think because the court of appeals did

QUESTION:

Would you agree that if one just

15

reads (e)(5), that the Secretary's position is

16

unreasonable?

17

MR. SLOAN:

No, I would not agree with that,

18

because (e)(5) includes the language that the employee

19

must have an opportunity to have the respirator fitted

20

properly.

21

about a test atmosphere.

22

that this imposes two requirements.

23

requirement that the employee be exposed in a test

24

atmosphere, and secondly, that if the test results show

25

that the respirator does not fit, the employer must do

And if — and it also includes the language
And what the Secretary said is
It imposes a

1

something about it, must give the employee a respirator

2

that does fit.

3

That's the meaning of fitted properly.

What the Commission said, and its view was that

4

the regulation required only the first of those.

5

require the employer to put the employee in a test

6

atmosphere, but it then leaves the employer entirely free

7

to ignore the test results and to send the worker back

8

into the work environment with the respirator after

9

getting results indicating that the respirator does not

It does

10

fit.

And in this particular case there not only is the

11

language of the regulation, but there is the fact that

12

respondent had actual notice that this was the Secretary's

13

interpretation, as is stated in the Commission's decision

14

and in the administrative law judge's decision.

15

The Secretary's compliance officer explained to

16

the respondent that the respirators had to be fitted with

17

banana oil or another kind of test atmosphere, and

18

respondent revealed this understanding in its own training

19

films by saying to its workers that if a test indicated

20

that its respirators did not fit properly, it would be

21

provided -- the employees would be provided with a

22

respirator that did fit.

23

respondent was not doing this, the Secretary's compliance

24

officer discovered, on this inspection.

25

QUESTION:

Yet despite this actual notice,

Mr. Sloan, you spoke of the question

1

of relative deferences between the Secretary and OSHA as

2

being a threshold question.

3

question the one which Justice Stevens began to pose, and

4

that is whether the Secretary's interpretation can be

5

accepted by us as reasonable in the first place?

6

if it isn't, I don't see how we get to the question of

7

relative deference.
MR. SLOAN:

8

9

Why isn't the threshold

Because

Well, we agree that that should be

the primary -- that that should be the first question that

10

the Court looks at, and that was a serious error in the

11

court of appeals' decision.

12

a court determines that the Secretary's interpretation is

13

reasonable, then it should be upheld.

14

could be a view that if the Secretary's interpretation was

15

reasonable, that then raised other questions of deference.

16

But that is exactly the question that we think the Court

17

should address, and that it -QUESTION:

18

It would be our view that if

And I suppose there

But that isn't the question you

19

presented in your petition for certiorari.

20

petition for certiorari you present the question of should

21

the Secretary's view receive deference rather than that of

22

the OSHA.
MR. SLOAN:

23

In your

That's correct, Chief Justice

24

Rehnquist.

25

Justice Souter is that we believe that a proper analysis

SUITE 400

1

of the issue would be to recognize first that the

2

Secretary is entitled to deference, which means that the

3

Secretary's reasonable interpretation should be upheld.

4

And so therefore the first question that the court of

5

appeals should address is is the Secretary's

6

interpretation reasonable.

7

QUESTION:

You're talking about what the court

8

of appeals should address rather than what we should

9

address.

10

MR. SLOAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SLOAN:

13

QUESTION:

That's right.
I didn't understand that.
That's right, Chief Justice.
Well, I suppose part of your -- part

14

of the question you presented is whether the Secretary's

15

position is reasonable?

16

something that's unreasonable.

17

MR. SLOAN:

Because you don't defer to

You don't defer to something that's

unreasonable, I agree with that.

19

this Court to hold that the Secretary's interpretation is

unreasonable.

21

And respondent has urged

And if the Court —

QUESTION:

You may -- I suppose you would think

22

we would be unreasonable if we said that the Secretary's

23

position is unreasonable.

24

thought that?

25

with questions of deference then.

But, nevertheless, what if we

I don't know why we should get mixed up

(800) FOR DEPO

MR. SLOAN:

1

Well, in terms of the question, it

2

is related to the question of deference, Your Honor,

3

because if in fact the Commission should receive deference

4

in its reasonable interpretations, then, as the court of

5

appeals did, there is no reason to consider the

6

reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation.

7

There's an important legal question at stake

8

here which has splintered the courts of appeals, which is

9

what are they supposed to do, how are they supposed to

10

approach the issue when the Secretary and the Commission

11

disagree.

12

reasonable interpretation should receive deference.

13

once that principle of law is clarified --

14

And it, it's our view that the Secretary's

QUEST-ION:

And

Well, if the -- you think the issue

15

here is just whether there should be deference or not, and

16

the court of appeals didn't think that it was entitled to

17

any deference, so it didn't reach the reasonableness.

18

MR. SLOAN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SLOAN:

21

QUESTION:

Of the Secretary's interpretation.
Yes, exactly.
That's right.
Exactly.

So we don't need to -- we

22

don't need -- technically we don't need to get mixed up

23

into the reasonableness issue.

24

MR. SLOAN:

25

Well -- I think that's correct, the

Court does not have to get mixed up in the reasonableness

issue if it clarifies the general legal principle that has

2

divided the courts of appeals.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Sloan, I don't know why you, I

4

thought you conceded earlier that the preliminary issue

5

was whether this was a reasonable interpretation of the

Secretary or not.

7

questions is logically prior.

8

whether deference is due if it's unreasonable, but just as

9

equal -- equally we don't have to consider whether it's

It seems to me neither of those two
We don't have to consider

10

unreasonable if no deference is due.

I don't know how one

11

can identify either of those two questions as the prior

one.

other one a certain way.

You don't have to reach the other if you answer the

deference, and I didn't mean to say anything contrary to

that --

QUESTION:

19

MR. SLOAN:

I thought you did.

All right.

The reason why I think that the

20

identity of the entity that should receive deference is

the threshold question is because that is the legal rule

that then structures the court's analysis in its case-by­

MR. SLOAN:

3

QUESTION:

That's right.
In whatever might be logically prior

4

in some sort of theoretical analysis, one question is

5

presented by this petition for certiorari, and that is who

6

gets deference.

7
8

MR. SLOAN:

That's correct, Chief Justice

Rehnquist.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's presented on the

10

assumption that there is some ambiguity that needs --

11

justifying deferring to somebody.

12

absolutely clear one way or the other, we certainly

13

wouldn't be arguing about deference, would we?

14

MR. SLOAN:

If the language were

Well, it is — the question

15

presented arises from the judgment of the court of

16

appeals.

17

QUESTION:

They assume that there was ambiguity,

18

and therefore they decided which one to have to defer to.

19

And you have presented the case on the assumption there is

20

ambiguity.

21

gone past the hurdle that Justice Souter raised.

22

you're starting from scratch, you're the first reviewing

23

court, and it looks absolutely clear to you, you're not

24

going to worry about deference, are you?

25

So in other words you have assumed, you have

1

there is no question of deference presented.

And I think

2

that's a very important point in focusing on what the

3

issue in this case is and what exactly is at stake,

4

because we completely agree with respondent that the

5

Secretary's interpretation should be set aside if it is

6

inconsistent with the plain meaning of the regulation or

7

with the plain language of the regulation.

8

completely agree with respondent that the Secretary's

9

interpretation should be set aside if it is unreasonable.

And we also

10

The only category of cases that is affected by

11

the issue in this case is the category of cases in which

12

the Secretary's interpretation is reasonable and would be

13

found to be so by the reviewing court.

14

circumstances we believe that the Secretary's reasonable

15

interpretation should be upheld.
QUESTION:

16

And in those

Mr. Sloan, may I ask you one other

17

question?

18

of deference is owed to the Secretary if her position is

19

taken only in a compliance order or in the litigation

20

itself, rather than in some other forum, to whit, a

21

consistent interpretation or one adopted by rule, or that

22

sort of thing?

23

Do you take the position that the same degree

MR. SLOAN:

That issue would bear on the

24

reasonableness of the interpretation.

25

question whether if it is only in a compliance order it

1

should receive deference, we would say that it should

2

receive deference, but that there should be a full

3

consideration of the reasonableness of the interpretation.

4

And to the extent that there would be a prior history of

5

such interpretations, then it would strengthen the case

6

for the reasonableness.

7

It seems that --

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, suppose it just comes to the

Commission to decide, and all they have is that particular

10

compliance order.

Do they have to bow down and defer

11

every single time because the Secretary has issued a

12

compliance order?

13

MR. SLOAN:

14

QUESTION:

Well, they —
So the Commission has to defer, and

15

the court subsequently has to defer?

16

their analysis when that's all you have?

17

MR. SLOAN:

How do they apply

When that's all you have, which is

18

the hardest question -- I should point out that this issue

19

encompasses a great many other kinds of interpretations by

20

the Secretary which aren't as hard as that hardest case.

21

But in that hardest case, what the Commission and the

22

court should do is to see whether the interpretation that

23

is reflected in that interpretation -- I'm sorry, whether

24

the interpretation that is reflected in that citation is

25

reasonable.

Now you have certain questions in those

circumstances that you don't have if the Secretary has

2

previously given some clarifying interpretation, even

3

though not in a regulation.

For one thing, the question -

QUESTION:

Why is that?

Why isn't the issuance

of a citation — is it the official act of the Secretary

7

or not?

Is it?

8

MR. SLOAN:

It is the official act.

9

QUESTION:

Is it a governmental act?

10

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, it is.

11

QUESTION:

And official.

Then why -- then why

12

does it get stronger, why would an unreasonable

13

interpretation, you say, only become more reasonable if

14

there have been a large number of citation orders?

I

15

mean, it's either reasonable or it's unreasonable.

MR. SLOAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SLOAN:

Well —
I don't understand that.
I agree that it should be upheld if

20

it's reasonable, and that's why my answer to Justice

21

O'Connor on this question was that yes, it should, it

22

should get deference.

23

to other interpretations, the reason why I'm saying that

24

it might bear unreasonableness is for two reasons.

25

reason is that it relates to the question of notice.

I think you can play that in reverse.

I think a reasonable interpretation gives notice, but I

don't think that when you give somebody notice you have

I give you notice of an unreasonable interpretation, it

inquiry, but you have an additional question, which you

2

don't have in the other case, which is a question of

3

notice, which you would want to be careful about.

4

And in terms of notice it's important, and the

5

role of the Commission in terms of what it's supposed to

6

do in that circumstance, it's important to point out that

7

in addition to the adjudication of the challenge itself, a

8

very important role that the Commission plays and that it

9

gets deference on is the establishment of the penalty and

10
11

of the category of violation.
In terms of the penalty, the -- there are four

12

factors that the Commission can consider in determining

13

the appropriate penalty, and in some cases in eliminating

14

a penalty altogether, and those are the size of the

15

business, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of

16

the employer, and the previous history of violations of

17

the employer.

18

determinations the Commission gets substantial deference,

19

and it is the Commission rather than the Secretary that is

20

entitled to deference on those questions.

And in those kinds of factual discretionary

And so even if you have a situation where an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. FAUGHT

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11

12

13

MR. FAUGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
What this case is about is a direct attack by

14

the Secretary of Labor on the Occupational Safety and

15

Health Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.

16

Secretary seeks to overturn a compromise reached by

17

Congress when it considered this legislation more than 20

18

years ago, and she seeks to upset a system of checks and

19

balances that has been in place since that time.

20

The

In considering the alternative bills before it

21

in 1970, members of Congress expressed strong concern that

22

placing all the administrative power in one agency head,

23

the Secretary of the Labor, would not gain the acceptance

24

of the regulated community that was necessary to achieve

25

the objectives of the act.

To resolve these concerns Congress reached a

compromise, and that compromise was to remove the

That is not correct, Justice White.

QUESTION:

I know that, but let's assume for the

moment that they had put it in a court, an Article III

What would be the rule an Article III court would

have to follow with respect to the meaning of a -- the

rule, so it does not directly apply to the Commission.
The Commission would, if the Secretary promulgated an
unambiguous standard under its rule-making authority,
then, as the Commission agreed in its amicus brief, the
Commission would be bound by that rule.

However, if the

rule is ambiguous, as it is in this case, that is exactly
the function that Congress wanted this Commission to carry
out.

And it's particularly important in the Occupational

Safety and Health area.
QUESTION:

Mr. Faught, maybe that's true, but

it's certainly not true because Congress wanted to create
an independent, as you have described it, an independent
adjudicative agency.

I mean, the supreme example of an

independent adjudicative agency is an Article III court.
And all the Government is arguing for here is to apply the
same rule to this adjudicative agency as Article III
courts apply.

So it has to be something more than just

adjudicative power that you're arguing for here.
MR. FAUGHT:

As this Court has held in a long

series of cases, beginning with SEC v. Chenery, Justice
Scalia, is that an administrative agency in adjudicatory
power also has the power to make policy.

That is the

exact kind of thing that Congress wanted to create in the
Commission here.
