ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHIAS J. DIEDERICH

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. DIEDERICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

In this case the National Labor Relations Board

13

found that the employer in this case had violated section

14

8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to

15

arbitrate 10 identical grievances filed by the union when

16

the grievance events took place some 11 months after the

17

expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.

18

Even though the Board found a violation of

19

section 8(a)(5) because of the repudiation, it declined to

20

order the parties to arbitrate because in its view it did

21

not feel that the particular — the particular grievances,

22

which involved a layoff and a provision in the contract

23

dealing with layoffs, arose under the contract.

24
25

And just briefly, the reasoning of the Board was
that because aptitude and ability controlled the layoffs,

1

or order of layoffs before seniority became a factor, that

2

the grievances did not arise under the collective

3

bargaining agreement.

4

QUESTION:

But wasn't it the case, isn't it the

5

case that to the extent that seniority is claimed to be a

6

factor, it does arise under the contract?

7

MR. DIEDERICH:

In the Board's view, which I

8

think is correct, seniority does not become a factor until

9

ability and aptitude are determined.

And ability and

10

aptitude certainly do not arise under a contract because

11

under the Board's view, relying on Nolde, it doesn't — a

12

grievance does not arise under a contract unless it is

13

some right which can be accrued or is a vested right, such

14

as wages, pension benefits, or severance pay.

15

QUESTION:

Well, were the grievances in this

16

case expressed solely in terms of aptitude and ability as

17

opposed to terms of seniority on the assumption that

18

aptitude and ability were equal?

19

MR. DIEDERICH:

20

terms of seniority.

21

QUESTION:

22

under the contract?

23

The grievances were expressed in

Well, then why doesn't that arise

MR. DIEDERICH:

Because the contract provides

24

that aptitude and ability are the controlling factors, and

25

seniority never becomes a factor until you prove that, or

you are able to demonstrate —

2

QUESTION:

Excuse me, maybe I don't, still don't

3

understand the grievance.

4

indicating in effect that the grievances claimed, that

5

there were instances in which ability and aptitude were

6

equal, and that therefore seniority ought to be

7

determinative.

9

Is that correct?

MR. DIEDERICH:

8

I thought you were saying or

No, I don't think the grievances

mentioned aptitude and ability at all.
QUESTION:

10

Okay, that's maybe where we — so

11

they were simply saying — the grievances were simply

12

claiming that seniority and seniority alone entitled them

13

to some consideration they didn't get?

14
15

MR. DIEDERICH:

The exact words were "out of

seniority."

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

17

MR. DIEDERICH:

The court of appeals upheld the

18

Board's determination that there was a violation of

19

section 8(a)(5) because of the repudiation, the refusal to

20

arbitrate, but the court reversed the Board's decision on

21

the -- arising under theory that the Board had adopted and

22

said that was unreasonable, and directed the parties to

23

arbitrate.

24

Now there is in collective bargaining a constant

25

theme that the parties are supposed to determine what goes

1

into a collective bargaining agreement and not the

2

Government.

3

contract that we have to look at and interpret and there

4

is no collective bargaining history, I think it's

5

especially important to look at the particular contract

6

provisions that are involved and try to determine what the

7

intent of the parties was, if it can be determined from

8

that language.

And in a case like this where we have a

QUESTION:

9

Well, Mr. Diederich, had this

10

grievance arisen during the life of the collective

11

bargaining agreement would arbitration have been required?

12

MR. DIEDERICH:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

And there certainly is a good deal of

14

language in this Court's decision in Nolde that suggests

15

that, similarly, arbitration would be required if it

16

occurs after the expiration of the agreement, as here.

17

MR. DIEDERICH:

Yes, that's true, Your Honor,

18

but Nolde was a civil action under section 301, which is a

19

statute, I am sure as you know, which gives unions the

20

right to sue employees and vice-versa.

21

reasons they can sue is to enforce a collective bargaining

22

agreement.

23

And one of the

That is precisely the question that I am

24

presenting here.

25

applicable to a section 8(a)(5) unfair labor practice

Is a section 301 lawsuit properly

1

case, because Congress has specifically defined what is

2

involved in a refusal to bargain.

3

is the only unfair labor practice of which I am aware

4

where Congress has specifically defined what the violation

5

is.

6

As a matter of fact it

And I simply don't believe that if you read the

7

statute, section 8(a)(5) and its definition in section

8

8(d), that you can say that the employer's conduct in this

9

case fits within the definition of that statute.

10

You

would have to shoehorn that conduct into that statute.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I guess the Board takes the

12

position that some of these grievances might have to be

13

arbitrated and some not, and in this case this one should.

14

I mean, Solicitor General will argue a position that

15

differs from your own.

16

Isn't that right?

MR. DIEDERICH:

No, I think the Board's position

17

was that there was a violation in the blanket repudiation

18

of the arbitration provision.

19

that the parties were not required to arbitrate.

QUESTION:

But the Board determined

conduct.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose --

the question.

I didn't hear the first part of

QUESTION:

Your position also is that you don't

carry over any doctrine from Nolde, which was a section

10

301 case, to 8(b)(5) when you have defined the refusal to

11

bargain.

12

MR. DIEDERICH:

Absolutely, because Congress has

13

specifically defined in section 8(d) what a refusal to bar

14

— what the obligation to bargain entails.

15

don't meet that obligation then you-have refused to

16

bargain.

17

terms of what a section 8(a)(5) violation is, I don't -- I

18

don't believe that language in a section 301 suit, which

19

is a suit really where you are just determining

20

arbitrability.

21

and there's stigma attached to being found to have

22

committed an unfair labor practice.

And if you

Why would you limit it to the arbitration agreement?

7

MR. DIEDERICH:

I don't think it does, Your

8

Honor, because the, the landmark case for the proposition

9

that you cite on unilateral change of working conditions

10

is Katz, and in Katz the theory was that while there are

11

ongoing negotiations it is destructive of the collective

12

unilateral changes.

have been on-going negotiations.

2

MR. DIEDERICH:

Not entirely correct.

For the

3

first 10 months of that 11 month hiatus, the status — the

4

representative status of the union was in doubt, because

5

there was a Board proceeding.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DIEDERICH:

Right.
At the end of the — around the

8

end of the 10 month period, the Board certified the union.

9

At that point the company —

10

But your initial refusal to bargain

13

MR. DIEDERICH:

QUESTION:

15

MR. DIEDERICH:

No.

Wasn't it?
No, no, no, no, no.

There was a

petition filed by an employee seeking to decertify the

18

QUESTION:

Right.

19

MR. DIEDERICH:

— shortly before the contract

20

expired.

That entire proceeding, from the time that

21

petition was filed until the Board ultimately certified

22

the union, was 10 months after contract expiration.

23

certified, the company exercised its right to then

QUESTION:

Did the Board purport to rest its

decision in part on Katz?
MR. DIEDERICH:

No.

Oh, I'm sorry.

The union argued Katz, but I don't

10

believe the Board argued Katz, and I don't believe the

11

Board relied on Katz.

12

QUESTION:

But why shouldn't the Katz

13

prohibition on unilateral changes prior to bargaining to

14

impasse apply to arbitration?

15

MR. DIEDERICH:

Because we have a long history

16

saying that arbitration is consensual, and we have many

17

Supreme Court cases saying that arbitration is consensual,

18

and we have a statute which says that a part -- basically

19

it says the parties should determine what goes into an

20

agreement and not the Government.

the act ordinarily bars changes in the terms and

But the Board has also adopted the view that it would be

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the rule is based on the

2

notion that a wholesale refusal to submit grievances to

3

arbitration is a repudiation of the bargain that was

4

reached, and therefore an unfair labor practice.

5

QUESTION:

What bargain, if it's expired?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is the point of trying

to apply Nolde.

And

11

therefore if the employer categorically repudiated its

12

arbitration obligation during this period, taking into

13

account the rationale of Nolde, the ordinary rule that

that would be an unfair labor practice carries forward.

15

The more difficult question for the Board was

the remedial one of how to identify whether the particular

that there is a duty to arbitrate during hiatus.

ability, are equal.

And in construing this, the Board reasonably
determined that seniority is only a fall back criterion

10

here and that what would have to be submitted to the

11

arbitrator necessarily as the first question is whether

12

aptitude and ability are equal between the more senior and

13

the less senior person.

14

And that is a question to be determined with

respect to aptitudes and abilities during the post­

QUESTION:

seniority was meant to continue after the agreement ended.

exclusion or other forceful expression of the parties'

2

intent to exclude a particular dispute.

3

And there the irony of the case is that the

4

Board concedes that had the contract simply talked about

5

seniority without aptitude and ability, it would be

6

arbitrable.

7

that the words "aptitude" and "ability" are tantamount to

8

an express exclusion from arbitration.

9

What the Board is trying to convince you is

Their argument amounts to a contention that

10

because the parties included those words, somehow they did

11

not intend to arbitrate this dispute, because the Board

12

concedes that absent those words it would be arbitrable.

expression on the part of the parties to exclude this

MR. ROSENFELD:
QUESTION:

10

That's right.

Even though the contract formally had

11

expired you would still, to bring a 301 suit you would

12

have to say what we're suing about is nevertheless

13

governed by the expired contract.

MR. ROSENFELD:

And what -- for

explicitly that it was clear that in Nolde the union could

have gone to court or the individuals could have gone to

court to bring a suit to collect their severance pay.

20

I think we probably — we could not have gone to court in

this case directly to sue over the seniority because we

were barred because we had agreed to arbitrate those

You probably, certainly could have

6

MR. ROSENFELD:

We could have stated a claim,

7

and I think I could have convinced a district court, had

8

we chosen that route, an alternative route, that the

9

arbitration clause was broad enough, there was no

10

expressed exclusion, and that under Nolde we had at least

11

an entitlement to get to the arbitrator.

12

QUESTION:

But you would have to nevertheless

13

convince the court that your cause of action really goes

14

back to the contract, even though it's expired.

15

MR. ROSENFELD:

16

QUESTION:

That's right.

And —

I guess in that respect, Mr.

Rosenfeld, you are in a different situation with respect

18

to the arbitration clause than you are with respect to the

other continuing terms and conditions.

21

been paying and was obliged to pay under the contract, you

For example, if I were to go to

hold yes, you're entitled to have that arbitrated because

11

You can allege that the discharge 10 months later

you have alleged that it violates the agreement.
But it would still remain possible for the

arbitrator to say well, yes, they're claiming it arises

out of the agreement, therefore I have jurisdiction to

arbitrate, but I don't see how in the world something that

happened 10 months later arose out of the agreement.

MR. ROSENFELD:

deny those grievances and say that in some cases the union

Well, not only do you have to

the argument because I'd be rather making that argument to

8

the arbitrator and letting him hear the bargaining

MR. ROSENFELD:

MR. ROSENFELD:

MR. ROSENFELD:

The Board — if --

It would?
Yes.

The Board has

5

traditionally taken the position that if the employer

6

regularly gives wage increases, and Mr. Chief Justice,

7

this arises both in the Katz situation where the employer

8

has a regular system of giving wage increases prior to the

9

completion of negotiations, the employer has to continue

that same system in effect.

And then when the parties

Even though it == even though there

is no contractual requirement at that point that would be

MR. ROSENFELD:

Right.

Because for example for

16

the employers to say that during negotiations I will give

17

no regular wage increases, although I had historically

done it, is to undermine the bargaining process.

19

QUESTION:

So it is treated like arbitration.

The theory is that that was what was anticipated in the

contract.

22

Is that the theory of it?
MR. ROSENFELD:

That -- not anticipated, no.

It's that for the employer to change conditions before the

is to undermine the bargaining process because, for

2

example, if the employer stops giving regularly scheduled

3

wage increases, then the union has to bargain it back in.

4
5

QUESTION:

So it follows from Katz, but not

Nolde?
MR. ROSENFELD:

6

The unilateral change doctrine

7

follows from Katz, but it is reinforced by Nolde, because

8

what this Court said in Nolde is that once you have

9

arbitration in the contract there is a presumption that it

10

continues in effect after the contract expired.
And that presumption of continuation of

11
12

arbitration is — it reinforces the Board's position that

13

all terms and conditions which are mandatory subjects of

14

bargaining continue after the contract has expired until

15

certain things happen, primarily an impasse in

16

negotiations is reached, at which point the employer is

17

free to change conditions consistent with its bargaining

18

posture.

19

In this case Litton comes to this Court in a

20

very bad position, because there was in fact an election

But

1

Katz encompasses all conditions, and the Board's theory in

2

Indiana & Michigan was that arbitration also could not be

3

unilaterally changed as long as there was a consensual

4

basis —
QUESTION:

5

But there are other forces in the

6

labor law besides the idea of no unilateral changes during

7

bargaining, and one of them is no compulsory arbitration.

8

9

MR. ROSENFELD:

That's right.

But when Congress

said there would be no compulsory arbitration, what

10

Congress said was that the law does not compel Litton or

11

any other employer to agree to arbitration.

12

But what the Board — what we think that Katz

13

now says is that once you have agreed to some kind of

14

arbitration, however expansive it is or however limited it

15

is, once you agreed to it in the contract you cannot

16

simply walk away from it at the expiration of the

agreement.

And the Board has just now said that's not so.

9

MR. ROSENFELD:

What we say is that you should

says is that the parties are free in their collective

that when the contract had expired they would bargain from

that level.

the expiration of the contract the employer will cease

contributing to the union's trust fund, because the

parties had contemplated that with the next agreement they

would substitute a new health and welfare or pension

program.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenfeld, can you argue in this

16

case, does it help your case to say that the Board is

17

inconsistent in ordering steps one and two of the

18

grievance process, but not the arbitration process?

19

MR. ROSENFELD:

It's not only inconsistent, Your

20

Honor, it puts the union at a severe disadvantage because

21

presumably during that period when we have to go through

22

steps 1 and 2, we can't take economic action, while the

23

Board says theoretically we can at some other point, and

24

that process could be dragged out for some period of time.

25

But more importantly, going through steps 1 and 2 in this

1

case is a useless exercise because all we do is go to the

2

employer and if he rejects it, that's the end of it.

3

And even Chairman Dotson in his dissent in

4

Indiana & Michigan said that it's like truncating this

5

well-crafted grievance and arbitration procedure to say

6

that there is some obligation to go through the first part

7

of it but not the last part.
QUESTION:

8
9

I can't see how the Board or the

Government can defend the order to go through grievance

10

steps 1 and 2, and not arbitration.

11

MR. ROSENFELD:

It also creates another severe

12

anomaly, which is that there are many grievance procedures

13

which provide for joint adjustment boards.

14

Coal case gives a very good example where there are five

15

intermediate -- five initial steps, and then a joint

16

adjustment board composed of union officials from another

17

union and mine officials from another mine.

18

know whether the Board is telling us that that step, which

19

is like arbitration for some purposes and unlike

20

arbitration for other purposes, is governed by this

21

doctrine.

22

contract provides that there's finally a step, which is at

The Gateway

4

And we don't

And yet that — and then that mineworker

.23

that joint board, which is very common to contracts but

24

not here, the final step is arbitration before a neutral

25

party who renders a binding decision.

QUESTION:

1
2

I take it you would then say that the

no-strike clause continues all the way?
MR. ROSENFELD:

3

Yes, and the Board has said that

4

in 1978 in Goya Foods.

And once again, Chief Justice

5

Rehnquist, when you dissented in Nolde you did for one

6

strong — there were two reasons, but the primary reason

7

was because of this note of the strike problem.

8

year later the Board in Goya Foods said that we will imply

9

the continued obligation not to strike over arbitrable

10

grievances, and we accept that.

11

can't.

And a

We recognize that we

12

And in this case this is what the union did.

13

The union filed a grievance asserting that the layoffs

14

were unjust.

15

which was to go to the arbitrator and have the arbitrator

16

make the determination whether those grievances violated

17

the agreement.

18

We asked for the benefit of our bargain,

The employer refused.

We didn't want to make the arguments about the

19

language of the contract to the Board, and I surely don't

20

want to make those arguments to this Court.

21

the Board tells us and what this Court has told us since

22

Warrior & Gulf is that those arguments as to the meaning

23

of the layoff clause, the meaning of seniority, and

24

whether the parties intended that language to continue,

25

those are arguments to be made to the arbitrator and not

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NLRB

8

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. WALLACE:

On page 58 in Indiana & Michigan

10

the Board specifically said that it has concluded that

11

Katz should not apply to post-expiration withdrawal from

12

arbitration.

13

Board's core expertise in interpreting and applying the

14

act itself that the union is taking issue with.

15

mentioned in our reply brief some of the pitfalls of

16

extending Katz to this area, and we think the Board's

17

determination there is entitled to deference.

18

And that is a matter that goes to the

We have

In — we disagree also that if the Board, in

19

reading the arbitration provisions, concludes that a

20

matter would have been arbitrable before expiration, that

21

necessarily means the Board has to conclude that it would

22

be arbitrable after expiration.

23

provision of the contract were arbitrable, that would mean

24

if an employee was hired after the contract expired and

25

then discharged several months later, still during the

hiatus period, his discharge would be arbitrable, even

2

though he never worked under the contract while it was in

effect.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what's the rationale for

5

implied — for requiring the grievance process then?

6

could the Board require half and not all?

7

MR. WALLACE:

How

Because the Board concluded that

8

the requirement — carrying forward the requirement of

9

submitting decision-making authority to an outsider goes

10

beyond a process of bargaining by the employer under the

11

preliminary grievance procedures, and goes to the point of

12

inconsistency with the congressional prohibition of

13

compulsory arbitration, when the arbitration can no longer

14

be called a creature of contract.

The earlier steps --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

16

you have answered the question, Mr. Wallace.

Thank you.
