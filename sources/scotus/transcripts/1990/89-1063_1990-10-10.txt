ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK S. DAWSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

v.

MR. DAWSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My client sued the insurance company over eight

11

12

policies of private mortgage insurance.

13

for summary judgment which was set for oral argument after

14

a lot of briefing.

15

January the 26th, 1989, you would have heard Judge Bohanon

They filed a motion

If you had been in the courtroom on

16

say, these policies should be and are cancelled.

17

these policies are void, and then he turned to me and Ms.

18

Dansby and said,

25

but you may appeal my

and looked at rule 4(a)(2).

24

the losing party has a right to appeal.

And so Ms. Dansby and I went back to the office

He said

QUESTION:

There was more in that colloquy, wasn't

there?
MR. DAWSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. DAWSON:

Than what you've just —
And I'll -- and I will get to that

in just a minute.

QUESTION:

MR. DAWSON:

Okay.
Well, I'll get to it right now.

He

said then -- back to Mr. Gray, who represented the defendant

7

-- I would like for you to prepare suggested findings of

8

fact and conclusion of law and I want you to point out for

9

me the evidence that you rely on and where I can find it in

10

the record.

11

said,

13

you may point that out to me, also.

and give your opposing counsel a copy of that and

And he gave him 10 days to do that and then

QUESTION:

This was on a motion for a summary

judgment, wasn't it?

MR. DAWSON:

findings of

19

summary judgment?

20
21
22

Does the district court ordinarily make

fact and conclusions of law in a motion for

MR. DAWSON:
rule 56.

Yes, Your Honor.

They don't have to, of course, under

They don't have to at all.
QUESTION:

And I --

I'd always thought of findings of fact

23

as being something you have at the end of a bench trial

24

where there are contested facts.

25

MR. DAWSON:

Yes, sir, and then I think the court

it required to under the rule.

But I think under a motion

2

for summary judgement because we, the lawyers, are supposed

3

to set out in our briefs what the facts are, that it's --

4

I can't tell you what's ordinarily done.

5

something like that.

I'd say 50-50,

But anyway, it's not a requirement.

6

We went in — went back, we filed our notice of

7

appeal and we said very specifically, we're appealing from

We said the judgment has

and did this on purpose.

We studied this

Then we get the letter from the circuit court that

Judge

Bohanon

We --

You don't think you would have been at

17

any risk if you had delayed filing your notice of appeal

18

until after the formal entry of judgment, do you?

19

MR. DAWSON:

The only risk that I see as a trial

20

lawyer is the risk of misdocketing, the risk of mailing it

21

late, the risk of running up a deadline.

trying these lawsuits, and you'll occasionally lose some of

When we came back from the hearing of Judge
Judge

Bohanon, in his decision — you can read it in the appendix

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, but you certainly can mark your

13

trial — your desk calendar to file notice of appeal later.

You don't dismiss it entirely from your mind, do you?

MR.

constantly on your mind.

middle of the night sometimes wondering, when am I supposed

18

to file it and am I going to get it done on time.

20

DAWSON:

No,

Your Honor,

you don't.

It's

And seriously, you wake up in the

Well, if you mark your desk calendar,

you won't wake up in the middle of the night.
MR. DAWSON:

21

Well, I do.

And you just do.

But you want to also focus on the next — the next

step and so we then started to focusing on the appeal after

Judge Bohanon ruled.

4

no doubt in my mind, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind

about this case.

6

said, Mr. Gray — or Mr. — he told us to help him prepare

7

some findings of fact which would support him.

8

next sentence is, there's no doubt in my mind — there is

absolutely no doubt in my mind about what I'm going to do

QUESTION:

DAWSON:

then we get the letter from

then they send us back an order which is

QUESTION:

1291 certainly speaks in terms of a

final decision, doesn't it?
MR.

DAWSON:

Final decision.

Yes, Your Honor.

4

And I think — and Professor Moore — I agree with him and

5

it is pointed out by opposing counsel — Professor Moore

6

says Rule 428 talks about announcement which will result in

7

an final decision or a final judgment.

9

QUESTION:

Well,

surely,

I think —

the case wasn't ready

for review in a -- by an appellate court based on Judge

10

Bohanon's oral statement.

11

fact; there weren't any conclusions of law.

12

that he certainly had some more things to do to make his

13

decision reviewable.

14

MR. DAWSON:

There weren't any findings of
And he said

Well, I think that his decision was

15

reviewable at that time, because he didn't have to enter --

16

he could have changed his mind and just said I'm just not

17

going to do findings of fact and conclusions of law.

18

— we would have -- everybody would want to see a journal

19

entry entered, so you would have the 30 days start to run

20

from that time, but even that can be waived by the parties,

21

as the Bankers Trust case —

I would ask the Court to

1

I think we're more or

2

less committed to using this word "final" and "finality" as

3

it's applied to judgments and so forth.

4

apply that term to oral announcements is really going to

5

cause a lot of problems.

6

final judgments quoted Judge Frank in the Second Circuit

7

1942 and he said this term finality is a slithery, tricky

8

word and there's not much finality to the definition of

9

finality.

But then to try to

Wright and Milliner, talking about

I think this Court has recognized that it's --

10

and has

called it a twilight

zone,

the use of the word

11

finality is a twilight zone.

12

a jungle of doubt — those words have been used about the

13

word "finality."

Subject to perpetual debate,

14

So if you want to -- that's the reason I suggested

15

earlier that the word "appealability" is a lot easier to

16

deal with in this context than finality is.
QUESTION:

.17

I just don't understand that argument,

18

because

19

Appealability is after the judgment becomes final.

20

do is postpone the effective date of the notice.

21

change the date of appealability or the date of finality.

appealability

5

MR. DAWSON:

6

QUESTION:

But you don't

Well —

As I understand your position it's just

7

it -- it doesn't become final until the judgment's entered.

8

But -- notice of appeal is treated as if it were filed the

9

day -- the next day.
MR. DAWSON:

10
11

In our simple case

that we have there, that is absolutely true.

QUESTION:

MR. DAWSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that's what the rule says.
Yes, sir.

That is very simply our

position, and I'll reserve the rest of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I

would

respectfully

propose

that

this

case

22

involved two basic issues to this appeal.

23

is the meaning of a final judgment, under section 1291 and

24

the second is what is the purpose and effect of rule 481

25

under the Federal rules of appellate procedure?

position is the judgment became effective on March 3d at

the time that the court entered its memorandum opinion and

the judgment was entered.
