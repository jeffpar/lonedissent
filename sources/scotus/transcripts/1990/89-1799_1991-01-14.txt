ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES 0. MORGAN, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MORGAN:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the

Court:
This is an action by Jeffrey Masson in which he

11

has claimed he has been defamed by publishing of

12

defamatory quotations purportedly said by him, but never

13

said by him.

14

appeal assumed that the fact that the quotations were

15

fabricated.

16

same assumption, however, I am prepared to discuss the

17

various factors that we introduced in addition to the fact

18

that the words were not on the tape.

19

Both the district court and the court of

I am assuming that this Court will accept the

The Ninth Circuit, in making its decision,

20

stated, one, that a fabricated quote that is wholly

21

fabricated creates an inference of actual malice.

22

went on to say then that fictionalized quotes will not

23

create an inference of malice if the fictionalized quote

24

is a rational interpretation of what the speaker said, or

25

if it does not alter the substantive content of what the

But it

1

speaker said.

2

Then they went a step further and they said, as

3

an example of the latter, that a fictionalized quote

4

created no inference of malice because it was consistent

5

with the speaker's lifestyle and his idea of fun.

6

further and said that it came within the same concept and

7

did not create an inference of actual malice if it was

8

substantially the same as his own self-appraisal of

9

himself.

10

QUESTION:

It went

Well, Mr. Morgan, do ypu take the

11

position that every misquote gives rise to an inference of

12

actual malice?

13

MR. MORGAN:

I take the position that every

14

misquote that is defamatory and is not just a very minor

15

misquote —

16

QUESTION:

Well, what is defamatory is typically

17

defined under State law, right?

18

MR. MORGAN:

QUESTION:

20

MR. MORGAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

That's correct, Your Honor.
Not Federal law.
That's correct, Your Honor.
So we're not concerned with that

here.
MR. MORGAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So

24

what we deal with here -- and California is interesting,

25

because in California if a statement exposes a person -4

1

that's all it is, it doesn't have to say that he does it

2

or he is it, or whatever, it merely says if it exposes him

3

to contempt, ridicule, obloquy, or if it has a tendency to

4

harm him in his profession.

5

statement of that form that is not what the speaker said,

6

in our opinion creates an inference of actual malice.

And so therefore any

And I'm not basing that on whole cloth.

7

We are

8

basing that on this Court's statement in St. Amant v.

9

Thompson when this Court said that professions of good

10

faith will be unlikely to prove persuasive,, for example,

11

where a story is fabricated by the defendant or is the

12

product of his imagination.

13

QUESTION:

Do you think the injury to reputation

14

is different when the injury occurs by virtue of a

15

misquote than when it occurs by virtue of a

16

characterization?

17

MR. MORGAN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And I

18

think that all of the amici briefs and their documents

19

they put in point out to you that the impact when it's

20

coming from the individual, as opposed to coming from the

21

writer's perception of the individual, has a greater

22

impact.

23

QUESTION:

I suppose the law has always

24

recognized that when it admits an admission by a party but

25

excludes hearsay.

I suppose it's almost the same

principle.
MR. MORGAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And so

obviously it has a far greater impact.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morgan, what if — what if I'm in

5

an interview with someone and I make some statements that

6

are very racist.

7

group is little more intelligent than dogs, that they

8

really can't cope in our society, something like that.

9

And the next day there appears in the paper the quote,

10

I say that I think a particular ethnic

Scalia says this group is subhuman.

11

MR. MORGAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MORGAN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
Now, that's an inaccurate quote.
That's right.
Is there liability for that?

I mean,

15

if they had, if they had quoted it accurately it would

16

have been just as defamatory.

17

MR. MORGAN:

Well, not necessarily, Your Honor.

18

We start with this.

19

of course, he also has the right of the freedom of speech

20

and the public has the right to hear exactly what he said.

21

Now, what you are doing is you are substituting your

22

conclusion for what he said, and yet the very words may

23

not necessarily be the same.

24
25

QUESTION:

The person that made that statement,

Well, that's right.

But I'm not

position that all you need for malice is intentionally

2

altering a quote.

3

intentionally altered.

4

that and the writer knows I didn't say that.

5

overcome the question of malice, you still have the

6

question of what's defamatory.

7

that that is an actual — an actionable defamation even

8

though an accurate quote would have harmed my reputation

9

just as much?

10

I intentionally — this is

MR. MORGAN:

There is no doubt I didn't say
But having

And it's your position

If I devine what I think you're

11

saying, and what I think you're posing, you're really

12

dealing with the concept of incremental harm.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MORGAN:

Yes.
Because you use the term

15

defamatory.

The minute you say something that will

16

subject me or expose me to obloquy —

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MORGAN:

Right.
-- it's defamatory.

But now the

19

next question is am I harmed by it?

Am I damaged by it

20

because I said something that at least in your perception

21

is similar to what they are writing?

22

concept, and my own feeling is that there isn't such a

23

concept as incremental harm and we really haven't seen it

24

anywhere yet, nevertheless I am still entitled to have a

25

trier of fact decide whether this particular one, this

statement, is any different than this statement.

As long

2

as I have met all the rest of the requirements, then it

3

seems that the trier of fact makes the decision well,

4

there's no harm because he said exactly the same thing.

5

That's not this case though, Your Honor, and I think

6

that's important to point out.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Morgan, in any event, wouldn't

8

any issue of incremental harm be a matter of State

MR. MORGAN:

QUESTION:

I believe so.
— rather than of First Amendment

law?
MR. MORGAN:

Absolutely.

I don't think it's an

14

issue here.

15

right in even raising it in this case.

16

I don't think that the Ninth Circuit was

QUESTION:

Could I change Justice Scalia's

17

hypothetical just a little?

18

clear that the actual quote is much more insulting and

19

harmful and defamatory, but yet the — what is actually

20

said is also defamatory.

21

that, by the fact it's inaccurate?

22

MR. MORGAN:

Supposing it's perfectly

Have you proved malice just by

Have I proved malice?

Yes, because

think it's a mistake to equate that case here.

Yes.

Now the only question

Who knows?

Maybe I'm

3

only entitled to $1 damages, but maybe I'm entitled to X

4

dollars punitive damages because of the manner in which

5

the writer brought about this situation.

that?

Who knows on

At least that's for the trier of fact to decide.

13

Isn't it — doesn't

this case turn on malice?
MR. MORGAN:

Well, but malice requires

defamation, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I mean, in other words —

I think a lot of people can defame

people and not be liable because they didn't do it

maliciously.
MR. MORGAN:

Well, but maliciously is the wrong

word, and I say this most respectfully to this Court, from

we prove enough in the district court that the articles

Whether malice was involved.

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, that's what I asked you and you

said no.
MR. MORGAN:

Well then I misunderstood you, and

my apologies, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't like the term malice

because for many people it excludes reckless disregard.
So you like to talk about reckless disregard.
MR. MORGAN:

Your Honor, all I can tell you, and

I have seen it occasionally from the courts, say that it

was a poor choice of words, and I say this most

Stevens' hypothetical, than the original statement.

are we protecting there?
MR. MORGAN:

3

What

Why —

Well, two things.

First, you know,

4

the concern I have here is these words weren't as

5

defamatory or the — as what he said.

equivalent.

7

the answer is what interests are we protecting?

protecting the right of the speaker.

They're not

But

We're

And as you have said before, and it's Virginia

Power or something like that that we have quoted in our

11

brief, that the First Amendment protects the

12

communication, the speaker, and the public.

13

when we're dealing with quotations, and we're now talking

14

about public figures and public officials, that certainly

he has a right under the First Amendment to expect that he

will not have a fabricated defamatory quote.

QUESTION:

And certainly

And that's

Well, I'm not sure that's a good way

19

to put it, to say he has a right under the First

Amendment.

QUESTION:

2

MR. MORGAN:

The First Amendment used as a shield.
That's right, because he's a public

figure.

public figure, and so therefore he has a right under the

First Amendment to be quoted as he spoke.

6

And so therefore, as at least he is labeled as a

QUESTION:

No.

He has no right as against the

7

New Yorker magazine under the First Amendment.

8

mean to say, I think, is that the First Amendment should

9

not prohibit State libel law from giving him that right.

MR. MORGAN:

(Laughter.)

12

MR. MORGAN:

13

QUESTION:

What you

I will accept that, Your Honor.

Let me now —
Under your rule, aren't you going to

14

create serious disincentives to use direct quotes or even

15

to have a tape recorder?

16

MR. MORGAN:

No.

No, Your Honor.

Direct quotes

17

have been going on as long as we know they've been going

18

on, and if you read all the material, they all tell you

exactly the same thing.

if you can't, then don't quote that, paraphrase it.

situation where
QUESTION:

2

Well, but you are, because you're

3

arguing that every misquote gives rise to an inference of

4

actual malice.

5

whose tape gets garbled and who relies on memory is then

6

at risk if the person quoted says that isn't exactly what

I said.

And so the reporter who's in a hurry, or

MR. MORGAN:

At risk, but not liable.

Certainly

anytime anybody writes — because again we have still got

10

the reputation to consider.

11

this tension.

12

that is defamatory, certainly there has got to be some at

risk so that the reputation is protected.

This is the other side of

Excuse me, you wouldn't get by a

motion for summary judgment unless, I take it, there was

MR. MORGAN:

QUESTION:

That's right.
Not just clear and convincing

20

evidence of a misquote, but clear and convincing evidence

21

that the misquote was intentional.

22

MR. MORGAN:

You're not --

Absolutely, Your Honor.

If the

reporter said look, I did it in a hurry, I thought what I

had was right, and I have no other evidence, I lose.

see that one conversation is tape 7, and one conversation

is tape 12.

And I think it's important to understand now,

In tape 7 he talks about his affair with a

she tells him you're great in the bedroom, but you're a

total embarrassment outside.

definition of intellectual gigolo, nor of any gigolo.

14

it shows is a young college kid who is a total

embarrassment outside of his bedroom.

there's another conversation in which Mr. Masson is

talking about trying to get patients as a psychoanalyst,

of that quote is that Eissler and Anna Freud thought of

QUESTION:
MR. MORGAN:

The reasonable interpretation —
Well, as Your Honor knows, if there

14

15

are two reasonable interpretations, one defamatory and the

other not defamatory, the court will assume it's

18

go the step further that even the fact of Mr. Masson

purportedly saying, two of the highest people in the —

In briefly setting out our position at the

1
2

outset, I'd like to begin with what I think is an obvious

3

point:

4

for its own sake or with setting journalistic standards.

What libel law is concerned with is misrepresentations of

substance with a defamatory gist of things.

that libel law is not concerned with misquotation

QUESTION:

Are you talking about the 50 — the

laws — the libel laws of the different States now?
MR. FARR:

In general, that's correct.

All the

libel laws.
QUESTION:

You feel you can make that sort of

generalization?
MR. FARR:

Yes.

I think all libel laws at

bottom are concerned with misrepresentations of substance.

15

Under the balance struck by New York Times v.

16

Sullivan and later cases, the First Amendment gives way

17

only when a writer knows or reasonably suspects or

18

recklessly disregards that the defamatory gist is false.

19

That's the same rule for all libel cases, whether they

20

involve quotations or not, and that's simply the point

21

we're trying to make here.

22

writer accused of misquotation unless the plaintiff can

23

show that the writer strongly suspected that he was

24

misrepresenting the gist of what was said.

those positions could be based upon somebody's being a

MR. FARR:

Well, let me explain that point that

I am trying to make, if I may.

3

QUESTION:

All right.

4

MR. FARR:

The point that I am trying to make is

5

that the inquiry is into whether the writer is knowingly

6

misrepresenting something that was said, the substance of

7

something that was said.

8

general, not their views on other issues that they were

9

not talking about, but a — the particular subject matter

Not somebody's character in

10

that was talked about and the views expressed by the

11

speaker on that subject matter.

12

misrepresentation, thus limited, then it seems to me that

13

no more than there would be if there was a direct

14

paraphrase do you have any situation where the writer is

15

knowingly misrepresenting the defamatory gist of what is

16

being said.

17

QUESTION:

If there is no knowing

So you say that a false statement by

18

a reporter in an article, such as Mr. Masson said this

19

when he in fact did not say it, is — cannot form any

20

basis for inferring malice?

21

MR. FARR:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't mean

22

to say that.

23

there may be knowledge of different words is not itself

24

all you need to prove malice.

12

13

understand that there is something particular that has

been said in that case that is being represented by the

reporter.

QUESTION:

that the very circumstance that someone makes an admission

21

again, maybe I'm not clear on the hypothetical.

particular racial group, and someone, and you are quoted

2

as saying that you are a racist with regard to that

3

particular group, then it seems to me the question is not,

4

well, does that settle the malice inquiry just because the

5

words are different and you can make an accusation that

6

the reporter knew the words were different.

7

inquiry then turns to the question is there sufficient

8

evidence from that alone, or even combined with other

evidence, as Justice Souter suggests, that the writer was

10

knowingly misrepresenting the substance of what you said.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, why should it be that way?

12

Why should — why should an intentional alteration of my

1

are two parts to the answer.

The first part, which is the

2

sort of legal analysis, is that I think that creates a

3

separate malice rule for quotations as opposed to other

4

ways of describing what somebody says, such as

5

paraphrases, which focuses on one particular kind of

6

falsity and not the same falsity that is the gist of the

I don't think so.

If, for

misquotation, as for everything else, you must know that
what you wrote is not true.
MR. FARR:

11

The question, though, is what exactly

12

is the gist of the action?

What is the core of the

13

action?

14

falsity of words.

15

defamation on simply saying the words are different.

are pursuing —
QUESTION:

But we don't have any question of

MR. FARR:

Well, it is the California law that

5

is intersecting with the First Amendment in this case, so

6

there — that's correct, you don't have to decide

7

California law, but that is what the California law

8

represents.

9

But if I could return to the second point I was

10

going to make to Justice Scalia, what I suggest you're

11

doing in saying any time you knowingly change words to the

press, now you are assuming the risk.

MR. FARR:

That's correct, and I don't dispute

that.

We are not suggesting, Justice Kennedy, that in

determining whether there has been a knowing

said, that you could use words said by somebody else about

him as part of the question as to whether there was a

inquiry is, because I think it will show that we're not,

is to look at the substance of all of the things that the

person has said, particularly to that reporter, on the

subject.

I'm assuming we're at the summary judgment stage, the

disputed parts and the undisputed parts, and make a

comparison between them.

one could draw a conclusion that the addition of the

disputed words will carry an inference that there is a

QUESTION:

To put it differently, if a

reasonable person could have given the words that
interpretation, even though another reasonable person
might not have given them that interpretation, putting it
in quotation marks is okay, right?

All it has to do is be

a — a reasonable interpretation of the words, right?

And

there would be no liability then, so long as it's one of
many reasonable interpretations, to put it in quotes?
MR. FARR:

I don't mean to be iropical, but I

don't think that's a reasonable interpretation of what I
said.
QUESTION:

I thought that that's what -- but I

thought that's what the test is.

Wouldn't you have to

show that — to show malice don't you have to have knowing
distortion?
MR. FARR:

You do have to have knowing

distortion, but I don't understand why the mere rational
interpretation test would necessarily protect you from
that.

It might in some cases.
