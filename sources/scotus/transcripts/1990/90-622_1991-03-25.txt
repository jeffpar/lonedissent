ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. NEIMAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. NEIMAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The respondents were lawfully stopped in Miami,

12

Florida for a traffic violation, and during that stop they

13

were advised that they were under suspicion for

14

transporting illegal narcotics in their automobile.

15

Thereafter they were asked for consent to search their

16

automobile for that narcotics.

17

the consent was granted and the officer went directly into

18

the passenger compartment and went to the brown paper bag,

19

which was a grocery bag, unrolled the paper bag and found

20

the cocaine in question.

21

Pursuant to that request

The lower court found these facts.

The lower

22

court also found that it could have been assumed by the

23

respondents that after they were advised that they were

24

looking for narcotics, that the officer would have gone

25

directly to the bag in question.

The court found, though,

1

that it was bound by the Florida Supreme Court's prior

2

decision in State v. Wells that it did not allow — that

3

consent did not allow the officer to open a container

4

within the passenger compartment.

5

directly through the lower court, found again the same

6

findings of facts, and also found the same conclusion of

7

law.

8

on the basis of State v. Wells.

9

certiorari jurisdiction.

This court traveled

The Florida Supreme Court without argument affirmed
This Court then accepted

It is the state's contention in this case that

10
11

the scope of the — of a consent is based upon the request

12

that is asked and the knowledge that the officer gets from

13

that.

14

are informed that they are looking for cocaine, or drugs,

15

as the case may be, they are further informed that they do

16

not have to consent if they do not wish.

17

further informed that if they did consent to the search

18

that during the course of the search that they could

19

choose at any time to terminate that search.

20

case no actions were ever taken by the respondents to

21

terminate that search.

22

Therefore, in a situation such as this where they

QUESTION:

And in this

Mr. Neimand, what if the automobile

23

had contained a locked briefcase?

24

the consent then?

25

They were

MR. NEIMAND:

How would you interpret

If that is a -- locked with a key,

1

then the, it probably would not be reasonable to assume

2

that the individual consented to have his property broken.

3

Under the theory of this Court of consent, the consent is

4

a voluntary nature to allow the citizenry to help police

5

ferret out crime, and it would not be reasonable, the

6

state submits, to assume —

7
8

QUESTION:

May I ask then, are you agreeing that

the Wells case was correctly decided?

9

MR. NEIMAND:

Only because the individual Wells

10

was not present at that time.

11

QUESTION:

12

So you do agree Wells was correctly

decided?

13

MR. NEIMAND:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. NEIMAND:

16

But at least on its facts.
On its facts, yes.

That's why we

did not —

17
18

Only on its facts.

QUESTION:

And that's the only authority that

this — the Florida court relied on in this case?

19

MR. NEIMAND:

20

QUESTION:

Correct.

When you answered Justice O'Connor

21

and you said that it's unreasonable to assume that there

22

would be consent to break the lock, did you mean that in

23

the technical sense of picking it or actually destroying

24

it?

25

he could just pick the lock?

Suppose the police officer was a good lock picker and

MR. NEIMAND:

1

I think that almost goes to the

2

same that if it was just clasp shut and you have a attache

3

case where you could just —

4

QUESTION:

5

No.

My hypothetical is this is a

good lock, but he's a good lock picker.

6

MR. NEIMAND:

Well, if he doesn't destroy the

7

property.

See, that's the key, the destruction of the

8

property.

I don't think any reasonable person would

9

consent to have his property destructed.

10

be -QUESTION:

11

12

I think he would

What about to simply have his lock

picked?
MR. NEIMAND:

13

Well, he wouldn't consent to have

14

the lock picked, but it would not violate the

15

reasonableness because he had no property destruction.

16

QUESTION:

17

of his consent was.

18

I know, but it goes to what the scope

MR. NEIMAND:

The scope would be determined by

19

what he was asked to look for.

20

QUESTION:

Well, where do you come out on the

21

question?

22

or is it not lawful if there is a strong lock but the

23

office is able to pick it?

24
25

Does he consent or does — is the search lawful

MR. NEIMAND:

In terms of a reasonableness

approach, that would probably be unlawful as to the scope

1

of the search because there was a protection interest

2

involved and there would be somewhat of a destruction of

3

the property.
QUESTION:

4

How about opening a woman's handbag?

5

It's a female driver who consents to letting the car be

6

searched.

She has a handbag with her.
MR. NEIMAND:

7

I don't think there's a problem

8

there, because it would not be locked.

9

different than a brown paper bag in this situation.

It would be no
You

10

would just open up the handbag and look in the handbag.

11

There would be no unreasonableness involved if you were

12

asking to search for a —
QUESTION:

13
14

What about a man's wallet that's

still in his jacket pocket?

15

MR. NEIMAND:

Again, I don't believe that would

16

be unreasonable if you're looking for a particular item.

17

Now, drugs probably would not be located in the wallet.

18

QUESTION:

You mean by allowing — when I

19

consent to have a policeman search my car, I am also

20

consenting to a personal search?

21

MR. NEIMAND:

22

23
24
25

Well, it would not be a personal

search.
QUESTION:

It wouldn't?

I mean, he reaches in

and he grabs my wallet.
MR. NEIMAND:

I would say that under the law

that in order to touch a person you have to have some sort

2

of reasonable suspicion.

If the wallet were lying on the dashboard, similar to a

4

purse which would be lying on the --

would be permissible.
QUESTION:

8

9

I misunderstood the question.

Well, but you have already abandoned

in — I think in your answer to Justice Kennedy and in

10

your current answer, the proposition that the only

11

determinant of the scope of the search is what you're

12

looking for.

13

scope.

in telling me that you can't — I mean, my, I am in the

MR. NEIMAND:

QUESTION:

5

MR. NEIMAND:

6
7

Oh, all right.
And that's the difference.

I see.

And so --

And if I wanted to search a person

I would ask to consent to search the person.
QUESTION:

Likewise, when you say may I look

8

into your car, I assume your answer to Justice Kennedy

9

implied, it does not say may I — may I look into locked

10
11
12

13
14
15

trunks in your car, right?
MR. NEIMAND:

It doesn't —

I can extend to that based on the

factual circumstances of a particular case.
QUESTION:

Your answer to him was you couldn't

pick the lock, right?

You could not.

MR. NEIMAND:

Again, what I would say, that it

16

would depend on the facts or circumstances.

17

the lock and I tried to open it, and I went with a lock

18

pick and the defendant or respondent will consent he was

19

there while I was doing that and there was no termination

20

of consent, or they basically assented to my conduct, then

21

that would be a further consent to --

Oh.

If I went to

Was there any objection when —

here instead, I mean, you could say no matter what the

2

initial permission was, when there was no objection to

3

looking in the bag, I guess, was that permission to look

4

in the bag?
MR. NEIMAND:

5
6

because they were told —

8

Well, under the terms here it was,

QUESTION:

Or does that only work for trunks and

not for bags?

MR. NEIMAND:

No.

They were told in this case,

10

Your Honor, that you may at any time during our search

11

terminate the search on any item.

12

13

situation as well.

14

that the lower courts did not go that far.

that,' simply that once you get the consent it goes to the

16

entire -- only the compartment and no containers within

17

that compartment.

So obviously in this

The fact of the matter is, though,
They said

they were —

Their basic approach was that you could stick your

narcotics in the car.

2

QUESTION:

There might have been what?

3

MR. NEIMAND:

At the time they located the

4

narcotics in the car, that gave them probable cause to see

if there was narcotics --

QUESTION:

for something else after they found narcotics?
MR. NEIMAND:

8

9

Yeah, but why did they have to look

But they didn't.

they exactly went to the paper bag.

In this case

And once they found

10

the paper bag, that was it, they were arrested.

11

no -- did not do any further search.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. NEIMAND:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

They did

They didn't search any further?
No, sir.

Because they didn't need to, did

they?
MR. NEIMAND:

In this case, because of the

17

facts, the respondents were under suspicion for

18

transporting that, those drugs in that paper bag.

19

just because there was suspicion that that bag contained

20

drugs, they did not have to ask specifically to search

21

that drug, because the search itself, the consent to

22

search itself was valid and they kept within the scope of

23

that search.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. NEIMAND:

But

Why was the search valid?
Because there was a valid consent.

Are these in the findings?

Because

these facts aren't in that much detail in the briefs.

MR. NEIMAND:

In the order of the trial court in

MR. NEIMAND:

The paper bag, I believe, was in

anything in that nature.

MR. NEIMAND:

It could be.

But it's not a total destruction.

Cheap or expensive, I gave no such

MR. NEIMAND:

It's merely an opening of the glue or the staples or the

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

that if the officer asked for consent to search the bag,

the defendant probably would have refused.

I thought the position of the State

QUESTION:

actual intent was with respect to searching the bag?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think, as the district court

found in this case, he could have assumed that the officer

intended to open the bag.

But that wasn't my question.

My

17

question was what do you think his actual intent was with

respect to having the bag searched?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

I think he hoped that the officer

20

would not search the bag, but that in giving a general

21

consent to search -- he may have harbored the hope that

22

the officer wouldn't search the bag, but he did not impose

23

that limitation on the general consent that he gave.

24

QUESTION:

I understand that.

But why do you

say then that you think if he asked if he could search the

MR. ROBERTS:

2

Because then Jimeno would have

3

realized that the officer was on to him, that he knew

4

about the bag, that he knew that the bag contained

5

narcotics.

6

The officer -QUESTION:

But that seems to me to contradict

7

the finding of the district court that the defendant — I

8

think the district court said could have assumed that the

9

intent — the defendant could have assumed that the

10

officer would have searched the bag.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

And in giving --

How does that square with your answer

13

that he, he would not have given the consent if it had

14

been asked for?

15

I don't see how you square those.

MR. ROBERTS:

Two different situations.

I think

16

if you ask for consent to search the car and you give that

17

consent without limitation, you can assume that if the

18

officer does go ahead with the search and comes across the

19

paper bag that he will have understood your consent to

20

include opening the paper bag.

21

Now, in a different case, if you had gone ahead

22

and said can I search the paper bag on the floor of the

23

passenger side of the car, the defendant would probably

24

realize that the police were on to him at that point and

25

wouldn't have given that consent.

That doesn't mean that

If you come up and the officer says can I

floor of the passenger side that you took out of the

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right.

And there's nothing

in the Fourth Amendment that requires the police to show

all their cards before they ask an individual for consent.

facts and not the officer's subjective motivations are

determinative for Fourth Amendment purposes.

Now, every court of appeal, every Federal court

of appeals to have considered facts similar to those

presented here has concluded, without dissent, that the

general consent to search the car includes consent to open

closed containers within the car, unclosed, unlocked

The decision of the Florida Supreme Court is

10

to the contrary, and we think that that decision should be

reversed.

What if it could be opened, say an

MR. ROBERTS:

That's, we think, no different

unlocked, can be opened.

consent to search the car, if it didn't include closed

containers, would, as the Court pointed out in the opinion

9

in Ross, not a consent case, would be a fairly meaningless

And we think — the general

10

right, because contraband, particularly narcotics, is not

11

strewn about the car.

12

therefore when Jimeno, in response to the question I am

13

conducting a narcotics investigation, may I search your

knew that that reasonably, the officer would understand

In

1982 Justice Stevens, speaking for the Court in United

Justice Stewart for a unanimous court in Mensi v. Arizona

only a few specifically established and well-delineated

exceptions.

The only one applicable here is consent.

In discussing Chadwick, Justice Stevens noted

10
11

that this Court recognized that a person's expectation of

privacy in personal luggage is substantially greater than

MR. WEINER;

I think that is a fair reading of

MR. WEINER;

QUESTION:

It just seems to me that the court

consent just can't include authority to open a bag.

MR. WEINER:

I don't think the Florida Supreme

I believe what the court

contents thereof, then there is no problem.

cannot and should not be implied that that includes

personalty and other things that might be in the car.

QUESTION:

But when the

Well, so you think a search of the

16

vehicle that is consented to, then, simply means to search

for things that might be spread over the seat or something

like that?

MR. WEINER:

Not necessarily.

Mr. Chief

20

Justice, there have been several cases in which searches

of vehicles included searches behind the seats, searches

under visors, under mats where evidence has been found,

If the package in question is the package in

The other options, as we discussed, is that they

have every right if, in searching the other packages, they

19

officers routinely ask for permission to search a place

Typically, however, the search warrant gives them

permission to search everyplace.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. NEIMAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. NEIMAND:

7

The theory that my opponent is stressing today

Thank you.

8

has already been rejected by this Court in Horton v.

9

California, and this Court has held that the fact that an

10

officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully

11

expects to find it in the course of a search should not

12

invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area

13

and duration by the terms of a warrant or valid exception

14

to the warrant requirement.

Well, what case is that, Mr. Neimand?

2

Because in those cases, as your opponent points out, there

Correct.

We say that we have the

property.

MR. NEIMAND:

The interesting point here is what

was told the defendant, that he could stop the search at

any time.

he had — he knew when they went to the bag that he could

have stopped it.

And under that type of language it's clear that

10

where there was a refused consent, because if there is a

11

refused consent the police will normally let the

12

individual go on his way, or the lower court, when they

13

suppress that evidence, it remains suppressed.

Because under this Court's holdings, when there

15

is an encounter and there is a request for consent and

16

there is no probable cause, when the individual says no,

then the police must leave the individual alone and walk
