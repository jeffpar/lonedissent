MR. CHAMBERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is the thirteenth time or fourteenth time

18

that black citizens from Texas and Mexican Americans from

19

Texas have been before this Court to ask for relief

20

against practices of the State of Texas which denied or

21

limited their participation in the electorial process.

22

Some of those cases involved overt practices of the State

23

which directly excluded it.

in the electoral process.

Congress, we submit, sought to address that

problem when it amended the rights — the Voting Rights

Act in 1982.

And we are here today to ask that the intent
We

We ask

The issue here is whether section 2 of the

11

Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982 applies to the

12

election of judges in Texas.

13

the plaintiffs had established a violation of section 2

14

and directed interim relief.

15

majority of the court held that section 2 did not apply to

16

the election of judges at all because it read

17

"representative" in section 2(b) to exclude judges.

18

The district court held that

The Fifth Circuit with the

A concurring opinion held that section 2 applied

19

to the election of all offices including judges.

But in

20

its view there was some unique feature of judges in the

21

district court level in Texas which limited or prohibited

22

the application of section 2.

23

Texas or the State had an interest in tieing the

24

electorate to the judiciary — to the authority of the

25

judges in Texas.

It found that judges in

2

person office in the way that judges were classified.
The Government advances another theory, and we

3

submit one that is not permitted by the Voting Rights Act,

4

that in some way the Court should weigh, and in some

5

instances permit, State interest to trump deprivations of

6

rights of minorities in the electoral process.

7

nothing in the Voting Rights Act of 1982 that permits that

8

kind of analysis and that kind of weight to be given to

9

the State interest that is being asserted in the case.

10

There is

With respect to the majority opinion, we rely on

11

the positions that were advanced by the petitioners and

12

the Government in the Chisom case which you just heard.

13

I would like to turn, unless there is some

14

further question about coverage, to the issues that were

15

raised by the concurring opinion and to the issues that

16

have been presented by the Government brief or amicus

17

brief in this case.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Chambers, let me ask you one

19

question about the meaning of section 2(a) which was, as

20

you point out, was dwelled on rather extensively by

21

counsel in the preceding case.

22

the results tests from White against Regester.

23

you rely for that simply on the use of the word results as

24

a verb in section 2(a).

MR. CHAMBERS:

It said that that embodies

That the section 2(a) covers the

election of judges or —
QUESTION:

No, no, but that — that it's a

results test --

4

MR. CHAMBERS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CHAMBERS:

Oh.

-- rather than an intent test.
I think the language, Your Honor,

7

as well as the legislative history clearly points out as

8

this Court held in Gingles that Congress was acting to

9

make sure that result, rather than intent, would be the

10

factor that would be -- that would enable one to establish

11

a violation of the act.

12

QUESTION:

So you say then that Gingles

13

established the proposition that 2(a) is phrased in terms

14

of results rather than intent?

15

MR. CHAMBERS:

I think Gingles said that

16

Congress, with the amendment in 1982, was establishing

17

result as the basis for establishing a violation.

18

suggested in section 2(b) how that result might be

19

established.

20

that one can establish a violation here for the election

21

of judges, including trial judges, under 2(a).

22

And it

So I think 2(a) clearly holds — provides

QUESTION:

If you have a case where there's a

23

blatant discriminatory intent, is there a 2(a) violation?

24

It might be difficult for us to imagine an intent without

25

a result, but could you allege an intent and have that

2

suffice to state a cause of action under section 2(a)?
MR. CHAMBERS:

I would think so, Your Honor.

I

3

think that 2(a) covers both intent as well as result.

4

think that Congress and I think the Fourteenth Amendment

5

was still there when Congress was acting — recognized

6

that a State may act intentionally and a State may act

7

with discriminatory results, and they wanted to make sure

8

it was covering discriminatory results.

9

QUESTION:

I

Mr. Chambers, Texas like many States

10

I think that elect judges has decided that it will elect

11

judges at large from the district over which the judges

12

have jurisdiction.

13
14
15

Is that right?

MR. CHAMBERS:

That's what the State has

asserted, Your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:

Now, does the Voting Rights Act give

16

the Federal courts the power to change that and require

17

that judges be elected from subdistricts?

18

MR. CHAMBERS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Just like it

19

requires that — permits the courts to direct a State —

20

establish subdistricts for legislative or subdistricts for

21

members of the school board or city council.

22

23

QUESTION:

Well, let's suppose it's a single­

person office like that of Governor of the State.

Yes.

1

could require that there be a committee of Governors?
MR. CHAMBERS:

2

Your Honor, on that I — I'm not

3

certain.

4

however, if the question is whether there is ever a

5

single-person office which would not permit that kind of

6

division among the electorate, I think the answer is that

— that possibly yes.

government in the State?
MR. CHAMBERS:

11

No, Your Honor, not as a — I

12

think that if there is a Governor and that is truly a

13

single-person office, this —

14

QUESTION:

15

Well, that happens to be the case in

all 50 States right now, doesn't it?

16

MR. CHAMBERS:

18

That's correct, Your Honor.

Uh-huh.

Yes.

No, I'm not suggesting that at

all.

MR. CHAMBERS:

I'm saying it may be, Your Honor.

You -- your -The Governors that I know today

would certainly be single-person officers.

So, you're — all -- you're just

8

reserving the situation for Governors that you don't know

9

anything — governorships that you don't know anything

about.
MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, I'm -- yes, Your Honor, but

12

I'm also thinking about cases like the City of Mobile,

13

where we had three commissioners who arguably were single­

14

person officers.

15

approved of a division of those offices in order to ensure

16

that minorities in Mobile would have an opportunity to

17

participate in electoral process.

18

And this Court approved or the low court

All I'm saying is it is not a per se rule.

I

19

think that what I know of Governors in the State of — of

20

States around this country, they would be occupying

21

single-person offices.

22

under no circumstances would a particular office which

23

they may be a single-person office, could be challenged

under the Voting Rights Act.

I just don't want to say that

1

were State interests that warranted not applying section 2

2

to the situation in Texas.

3

section 2, as enacted by Congress, requires a type of

analysis that does not permit a per se exclusion for the

application of the act.

provide protection for minorities who were limited in

their participation in the electoral process.

8

Congress set up a structure for an analysis.

9

place where you really begin to look at State interest is

First, I would point out that

The Congress was trying to

And the
And the only

10

under one of the factors that Congress listed, which talks

11

about tenuousness of a State practice.
Here if the plaintiff put this issue into

12

13

consideration, the Court is to look and see whether the

14

assertive State practice is tenuous, and if it finds it is

15

or if it finds it's not, that's just the factor that the

16

-- that the Court is to look at and make a determination

17

in the totality of the circumstances whether there is in

18

fact vote dilution.

19

establishment of a dilution and a particular electoral

20

process.

21

It is never, I submit, a bar to one's

Second, here there was no evidence offered I

22

submit that warranted a court deciding that it would bar

23

— that as a State's interest -- application of section 2.

24

If we go through and look at the actual State practices

25

that were involved, we'll see that there is no

1

justification for really asserting -- that there is some

2

strong, significant State interest.

3

that tieing the jurisdiction to the electorate in some way

4

promoted accountability.

5

have Statewide jurisdiction, not just county jurisdiction.

6

For example, we hear

But district judges in Texas

They had issued decisions that affect the whole

7

State.

For example, a decision in the district court just

8

the other day reconstructs the whole method for financing

9

education in Texas.

10

QUESTION:

Well, is that because they have

11

jurisdiction in other counties or just because a lawsuit

12

can be brought into the county in which they have

13

jurisdiction which has parties to it that would be in from

14

other counties?

15

MR. CHAMBERS:

Your Honor, I think it's somewhat

16

-- it's some of both, because the other point I was going

17

to make is that district judges in — in Texas can be

18

assigned to other districts in order to, for example, help

19

with docket control.

20

QUESTION:

By what?

21

MR. CHAMBERS:

The Chief Justice?

By the Chief Justice, by the

22

administration — the Chief Administrator of the courts,

There is a

question before us.

I would think that from what you said

that you would say that that would be the -- that would

have to be what the remedy is.

QUESTION:

What -- what was it you disagreed

with the Solicitor General on?
MR. CHAMBERS:

The Solicitor General suggests

that the — because we are dealing with judges, we should

10

in reviewing this case weigh more heavily the State

11

interest in having this particular type of structure.

12

my problem is and I think the petitioners submit that that

13

is not first of all contemplated by section 2.

14

-- and I pointed out earlier that section 2 contemplates

15

that particular interest being weighed, and the courts

16

evaluation of whether there is a tenuous State practice.

17

QUESTION:

And

What the

But I don't -- I don't suppose that

18

we really — that we really need to pass on this -- your

19

— the disagreement between you and the Solicitor General.

20

MR. CHAMBERS:

Except, Your honor, the Solicitor

21

General suggests that the case should be remanded to the

22

district court for further findings under some, I submit

23

with all due respect, unannounced standard for weighing

24

the State's interest in a judicial election case.

that would be a question of remedy though.
MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, it may be, and if -- at

3

best where that interest is to be considered would be in

4

the remedial stage.

5

suggested that it may be a factor that should weigh

6

heavily in the liability determination.

7

is it is not that kind of factor that should be weighed,

8

and there's no basis for remanding the case.

QUESTION:

But the Solicitor General has

And our position

Well, Mr. Chambers, you take the

10

position that under the -- the term "totality of the

11

circumstances" that it doesn't mean totality -- that you

12

can't weight the State's interest as part of the totality.

13

MR. CHAMBERS:

No, Your Honor.

What we say is

14

that the State's interest comes in as a tenuous factor

tenuous as the --

Your Honor, there are seven

Your Honor, I don't think that

What — what is the standard that you're —

MR. CHAMBERS:

I think Professor Collin pointed

out the appropriate standard that ought to be considered.

10

If the State, as the State in Texas, has set up a system

11

that says that there will be 59 judges to 2.4 million

12

population, and some other counties that says that there

13

may be 3 judges for 200,000 population.

14

we demonstrate that there is a percentage of minorities in

15

that district, for example, the 200 district, who could

16

elect a representative or could elect a judge, we give the

17

Court an appropriate standard for measuring whether the

minorities in that particular district and whether the

19

Court should direct some kind of relief.

20

If we point -- if

It's the same kind of approach that the Court

21

followed in Gingles.

It may be that one-person, one-vote

— one-person, one-vote doesn't apply to the election of

MR. CHAMBERS:

Your Honor, if the State in this

judges for whatever reason -- you raised a question

9

earlier about whether, for example, the caseload --

an opportunity to participate effectively deprives them of

to address.

What

we're suggesting is there must be a remedy that would

permit minorities to participate equally in the process.
QUESTION:

3

So you're saying if I understand you

that any numerical ratio that fits within the range the

5

State now tolerates is an appropriate numerical ratio when

we're trying to devise a remedy for your purposes.

7

MR. CHAMBERS:

Well, I'm not certain about the

remedy.

I'm using this analogy for purposes of deciding

whether minority votes are submerged, and suggesting that

if the Court finds that they are, the case goes back to

11

the district court for a determination of the appropriate

remedy.

But you're saying whether -- whether

we know what that variation is and we know that we can

QUESTION:

Well, you're using a one — one-

MR. CHAMBERS:

Yes, using -- using the

percentage of people.

Because one-person, one-vote I

applicable, for example, to Jefferson County where we have

less that 41,000 people per judge.

So you'd apply it with -- you'd apply

MR. CHAMBERS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So if we -- if we agree with you, I

would think we would just tell the Fifth Circuit they were

14

MR. CHAMBERS:

They -- there has to be, but the

MR. CHAMBERS:

If — you can read in the brief,

he suggests that State interest may trump the interest of

minorities in being able to participate in the electoral

process.

totality of the circumstances to decide whether there's

MR. CHAMBERS:

Mr. Hicks, is it your position that

section 2 in its entirely doesn't apply to judges — not

at all?

6

2(a) doesn't have any application either?
MR. HICKS:

I don't think it's necessary to

7

answer that question in this case, because we've been

8

found not to discriminate intentionally, but I think there

9

is no legislative history to indicate that in 1965

10

Congress intended to get at judges.

11

I also think though the test for how much they

12

had to have paid attention is different for 1965 because

13

they weren't exercising their enforcement clause powers

14

under section 2, as Bolden has seen it in retrospect.

15

They were just announcing -- regurgitating what the

16

Constitution said.

17

they move to the effects test.

18

So there is a different standard when

But I do emphasize Texas has been found

the effects test that matters.
