ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON SIEGEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIEGEL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The James B. Beam Distilling Company is an out-

11
12

of-state producer of alcoholic beverages.

13

taxing scheme that was in effect at the time Beam was

14

required to pay an excise tax at twice the rate as

15

producers of alcoholic beverages within the State of

16

Georgia.

17

was unconstitutional because Beam was not a producer in

18

State.

19

long line of Commerce Clause discriminatory taxing

20

structures, and said that it was parochial, protectionist,

21

and it only benefitted the in-state producers.

22

tax is similar to the tax that this Court reviewed in

23

Bacchus.

well as its own constitution.

2

because the Georgia Supreme Court refused to retroactively

3

apply its decision.

4

now before this Court.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SIEGEL:

Beam was denied a refund

Therefore retroactivity of Bacchus is

What years were in question?
The first year of the refund was

7

1982 through 1984, so it covers a period prior to your

8

decision in Bacchus.

9

QUESTION:

Just out of curiosity, does Georgia

10

require that in order to get a refund the tax has to be

11

paid under protest?
MR. SIEGEL:

12

Georgia had no predeprivation

13

statute.

The relief that they provide by statute is post

14

remedy.

15

only way that they could ship product into the State is if

16

they paid this tax.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SIEGEL:

The only way that Beam could do business, the

And they paid it.
They paid it, indeed, otherwise

19

they would be precluded from being able to sell its fine

20

products to the people of Georgia.

21

Georgia was wrong not to apply this tax

22

retroactively.

23

Court last term in American Trucking Association, there

24

are two alternative ways to reach this conclusion.

25

Clearly Beam would prevail under either of these tests.

Based upon the different opinions of this

1

Under the view of five of the Justices, all

2

civil constitutional decisions should be applied

3

retroactively.

4

Beam made its very first payment in 1982.

5

would therefore result in a reversing of the decision of

6

the supreme court on retroactivity and the case should be

7

remanded for purposes of considering the remedy.

8

9

Thus, the tax was unconstitutional when
The per se rule

If the Court was to adopt the view of the
plurality in the American Trucking Association case, as it

10

recognized the narrow exception that is set forth in the

11

three-step test of Chevron, then it would be the burden of

12

the State to show, as the Court explained in Ashland Oil,

13

that first the decision of the Court was overruling a

14

clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied,

15

or it must be an issue of first impression which

16

resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.

17

Bacchus may be subject to differing viewpoints,

18

but Bacchus in terms of its analysis of the Twenty-first

19

Amendment was not revolutionary.

20

Bacchus contributed to the continuing jurisprudence of the

21

Commerce Clause —

22

QUESTION:

It was not shocking.

Well, Mr. Siegel, do you think that's

23

the test under the plurality view in -- in American

24

Trucking Association, that it should be shocking or

25

revolutionary in order to be denied retroactive effect?

MR. SIEGEL:

1

That is the effect of what I see

2

coming out of the Ashland language, although it was per

3

curia.

4

some type of strike of lightning, so that perhaps there,

5

as I pointed out, there may be differing viewpoints.

6

fully recognize that three Justices dissented in Bacchus.

7

But I don't believe that when Bacchus was decided anyone

8

was taken by surprise, if we go back and take a look at

9

the Commerce Clause cases, or indeed if we look at any

The language that was implied in there is that

10

other direction where the Twenty-first Amendment was

11

judged in view of other constitutional principles.

12

I

It is on that point, the test of the plurality,

13

that I would like to continue with my remarks.

The State

14

would argue that Young's Market is the controlling case ■

15

here.

16

country went through the noble experience of prohibition.

17

It reflected, and I think there is some significance to

18

this, the viewpoint that national control of the industry

19

was not appropriate, that each State should be able to

20

determine whether it or not it desires to permit the sale

21

of alcoholic beverages or not to permit the sale of

22

alcoholic beverages.

Young's Market was decided shortly after the

I would submit, however, that if I was a lawyer

24

working for the State of Georgia, understanding full well

25

that there may be some respectful disagreement on this

1

point, and I was to look in the year 1982 at the cases

2

that have been decided by this Court from 1934 — from

3

1930 forward, I would clearly see the Hostetter v.

4

Idlewild decision in 1964, where a majority of the Court

5

took a look at the Twenty-first Amendment, looked back on

6

the cases that had been decided in the 1930's, and

7

acknowledged the fact that the States were totally

8

unconfined when it restrains the importation of alcoholic

9

beverages destined for use.

But the Court then went on to

10

say, to draw a conclusion from this line of cases, that

11

the Twenty-first Amendment has been repealed is absurd,

12

and they went on to say it is bizarre and incorrect.

13

At that point the Court stated that the Twenty-

14

first Amendment, like other provisions in the

15

Constitution, must be considered as it relates to the very

16

factual setting, and it must take into account whatever

17

competing constitutional provisions are applicable.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Siegel, now, your client

19

didn't bring any challenge here until after Bacchus was

20

decided.

21

MR. SIEGEL:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And yet you thought the law was clear

Honor, James Beam Distilling Company, like other out-of-

2

state distillers, engages in business in all 50 States.

3

Every State has a pervasive system of regulation.

4

regulations vary from State to State.

5

Company is not in the business of filing lawsuits.

6

rather would devote its resources to doing business, nor

7

does it look kindly upon the prospect of filing suit

8

against State Government, the very institution that

9

regulates it.

However, when this Court spoke in 1984 in

10
11

Bacchus, it reignited our interest in these discriminatory

12

taxing statutes, and it was at that time that they sat

13

down and decided that after all they were at a great

14

disadvantage doing business in the State.

15

reason why they elected to file the claim after the

16

Bacchus decision came down.

17

And that is the

So clearly the difference here is that we are

18

dealing with a 3-year statutory period for a refund prior

19

to Bacchus, as opposed to the case that you reviewed in

McKesson.

21

the 1970's it would take a look at Craig v. Boren, which

22

applied the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment as it

23

relates to the Twenty-first Amendment, and they concluded

24

at that time that gender based discrimination could not be

25

tolerated even under the Twenty-first Amendment.

The case that I feel most clearly drives home

1
2

the point that we may have differing viewpoints as to how

the earlier 1930 cases were interpreted, I would contend

first of all that the reasoning in those cases has been

totally repudiated at this point.

6

opportunity for the Court to consider that point.

7

It may well be the

What I think is important about Midcal is that

8

it looked back and it took a look at the historical

9

development of this fascinating Twenty-first Amendment.

10

It acknowledged that some of the decisions of the Court

11

have dealt squarely with the express terms of section 2.

12

It also acknowledged that in some instances it applied a

13

much broader application in the interpretation of the

14

amendment.

15

powers of the Twenty-first Amendment — importation,

16

transportation, and what this Court has defined in Midcal

17

as distribution — when those core powers are not involved

18

in a particular case the Federal competing interests, so

19

long as there can be shown that there was a longstanding

20

interest such as the -- a principle in favor of free and

21

open competition that was the subject of the Midcal case,

22

such as the Court's consistent declaration of not

23

countenancing any type of discriminatory taxation --

MR. SIEGEL:

QUESTION:

4

That is correct.

Our position --

And you are still on the first

criterion?
MR. SIEGEL:

5

I am, Justice White, because I

6

don't think the State can bear the burden of satisfying

7

that first prong in order to get prospective relief in

8

this case.
QUESTION:

9

MR. SIEGEL:

10

How about the other prongs?
If we were to go to the second

11

prong, the best example I can give you in the second prong

12

being that you do not apply prospective relief in the case

13

if it frustrates the very purpose of the — of the rule.

14

Here you have a situation much the same as what you had in

15

Florida.

16

legislature in Florida came right back.

17

that is precisely what the second prong addresses.

18

Georgia legislature did the same thing.

19

as though they have not yet been willing to accept the

20

principles of this Court when it comes to discriminatory

21

taxation.

22

The original tax was knocked out.

Parochial indeed,

It appears to me

And if we were to go to the third point, which

23

is to take a look at the hardship, we are talking about a

24

total of $30 million.

25

not going to put the State of Georgia in a financial bind.

That's a lot of money, but it is

At this point then --

QUESTION:

May I ask on that $30 million, is

3

that the total amount collected or the amount by which, is

4

that the discriminatory increment?

MR. SIEGEL:

My client, Justice Stevens, Beam,

6

their claim for refund is $2.4 million.

7

companies filed refunds as well.

for this period.

QUESTION:

The total is $30 million

But if you, if they only give the

10

amount of refund that the Federal Constitution mandates

11

you would only get 1 point -- you would only get half of

12

that amount, is that right?

13

MR. SIEGEL:

14

QUESTION:

Would we settle for half?
I mean, that's all you would be

15

entitled to as a matter of Federal law.

get more as a matter of State law.

17

MR. SIEGEL:

That is correct.

Maybe you would

We are looking

18

for equality, the point that you addressed in McKesson.

There is no question about it.

MR. SIEGEL:

And the Attorney General is here,

be delighted to talk with him right after the hearing.

23

The point is in this entire discussion with regard to the

Twenty-first Amendment that nothing really was

2

Twenty-first Amendment law has been clear for everyone,

3

and I think that even the Georgia lawyer that sat down and

took a look at it at that point would have to agree that

there was nothing so revolutionary --

differ as to our analysis, but they were not taken by

QUESTION:

4

Yet Hostetter purported to reaffirm

Young's Market, didn't it?
MR. SIEGEL:

It did not reaffirm Young's Market,

subsequent decisions have totally overruled Young's

Market.

progression of the decisions in the '60's, the. '70's, and

But what I do feel has happened is through the

10

the '80's — if we were to take a look at the Court's

11

Twenty-first Amendment decisions since 1980 — Midcal,

12

Rice v. Williams, Grendle v. Larkin, Bacchus, Capital

13

Cities -- in every instance except your recent decision in

14

North Dakota you have determined that the Federal interest

15

that was competing with the Twenty-first Amendment was

16

more significant than what the State was attempting to

17

protect.

18

Rehnquist, would have been South Dakota v. Dole where you

19

really didn't get into the Twenty-first Amendment that

20

much.

21

Perhaps the one exception to that, Justice

That says to me that there has been a historical

22

progression here which has looked back and brought us up

23

to the 1980's.

Hostetter is the fact that it rejected any notion that the

25

Commerce Clause had been repealed.

QUESTION:

At what point was an official in the

Was it back at the time Hostetter

How many times do we see governmental

QUESTION:

Yes, but I am entitled to ask you a

11

question, even though you are not consulting with the

MR. SIEGEL:

Clearly 1964 in my judgment.

That

17

is the Hostetter decision.

Because they came right out

and repudiated what had been the thinking up to that

point, and they said any idea that the Commerce Clause has

been repealed is absurd, is incorrect.

in any Twenty-first Amendment case we balance the

23

view of the context of the facts that are submitted at any

particular time.

That is very

1

in which the State of Georgia should have recognized that

2

there is a change from the earlier rulings of this Court

3

back in 1930.

4

So under the Chevron analysis it is our judgment

5

that the State of Georgia cannot bear the burden of

6

satisfying the first prong, and therefore it would not be

7

necessary to go any further.

8

decision of the Georgia Supreme Court in not granting

9

retroactive relief should be reversed.

If that's the case, then the

And as I pointed

10

out in this instance, although this case is not directly

11

involved with McKesson, clearly there is a prescribed

12

remedy under the Georgia refund statute which would allow

13

our client to get a refund consistent with this Court's

decision in McKesson.

Thank you.

May I ask you one question before you

question presented in the cert, petition said when a

taxpayer pays under protest the States tax and so forth.

You mentioned the refund statute.

That is correct.
What is the, what is the significance

of that?
MR. SIEGEL:

1

a tax, Justice Stevens, and you are forced to pay it

2

really under duress, because if Beam was to ship goods

3

into that State — what happens is they buy tax stamps.

4

If the product comes in without those stamps it will be

5

seized and their license to do business would be revoked.

6

So they were obviously not in agreement with what was

7

going on.

8

they finally got around to recognizing that they were

9

going to take advantage of the Court's decision in Bacchus

They didn't file any official protest, but when

10

they then went ahead and protested every subsequent

11

payment.
QUESTION:

12

What you're saying is that every

13

taxpayer in order to ship into the State, I mean, every

14

liquor company must get the stamps, and that is enough,

15

that is all the protest you need in order to file a refund

16

action.

17
18

MR. SIEGEL:

Once you pay the tax you are --

yes, you are entitled to —

Is that what you're saying?

QUESTION:

requires.

21

MR. SIEGEL:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Would that be true in a State that

23

specifically required by law payment of tax under protest

following certain procedures?

taken advantage of it.

a statement that said we protest?

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
You don't think you had that

opportunity?

16

-- if we would have had that opportunity we would have

that the Twenty-first Amendment empowers a State to

As the dissent pointed out in Bacchus, the

majority in Bacchus adopted a totally novel approach to

the Twenty-first Amendment in that case by going beyond

9

the express language of the Twenty-first Amendment and by

10

going beyond the precedent of this Court in finding that

14

MS. BAKER:

What is your response to

Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree

15

with the petitioner on that point.

The Hostetter case

represents one type of limitation that the Court did

recognize in the Twenty-first Amendment, and that the

18

Court said that where you — where the State attempts to

transported into the State for use therein as prescribed

by the language of the Twenty-first Amendment, then the

did not fit within the express language of the Twenty-

2

first Amendment.

3

It is also true that in that case the Court

4

recognized that the Twenty-first Amendment did not divest

5

Congress of its power to regulate alcoholic beverages.

6

That's the important statement that was made in Idlewild,

7

and the statement was made to make sure that the States

8

were aware that the Federal Government, pursuant to the

9

Commerce Clause, could continue to operate and enact

10

statutes such as the Sherman Act that would also regulate

11

alcoholic beverages.

12

But nothing in Idlewild suggested in anyway that

13

the State was limited in its ability to import alcoholic

14

beverages into the State for use in the State.

15

no limitation on a direct regulation of alcoholic

16

beverages, which the State tax here clearly is.

17

There is

There are, there were a number of cases between

18

Young's Market and Bacchus in which this Court did

19

recognize some limitations on the Twenty-first Amendment,

20

one being the jurisdictional limitation in Idlewild.

21

There were a number of other limitations, but none of

22

those limitations ever went to the State's ability to

23

regulate the importation of alcoholic beverages.

25

Mr. Siegel suggests that the Midcal case was
sufficient to put the State of Georgia on notice.

involved there are entirely different.

3

Court said that in instances where you have a Federal

4

statute enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause, and you

5

have a State statute that is not directly regulating

6

alcoholic beverages but is peripheral to the regulation of

7

alcoholic beverages, then in those cases where you have a

8

State statute, where you have a Federal statute and a

9

State regulation that is not aimed at the core powers of

10

the Twenty-first Amendment, we will engage in a weighing

11

of interests to see whether the Twenty-first Amendment

12

prevails.

13

In that case the

Again, in that case that Court recognized that

14

the ability of a State to regulate importation into its

15

borders was not limited by the Commerce Clause.

16

until 11 days before the decision in Bacchus in this case

17

of Capital Cities Cable v. Crisp, also decided in 1984,

18

this Court once again reiterated that a State's power to

19

impose burdens on interstate commerce in alcoholic

20

beverages is not limited by the Commerce Clause.

Even up

We submit, therefore, that from the time of

noted by three members of this Court that it was a totally

2

novel approach and it was unanticipated by any cases, and

3

it was inconsistent, arguably, with the express language

of the Twenty-first Amendment.
Additionally, the State of Georgia relied on its

5

own highest court, which in 1939 in the case of Scott v.

State had upheld the same statute, in a different, earlier

version, but essentially the same tax structure had been

upheld against a Commerce Clause challenge.

have had a better chance to get a refund in this case than

whether the rule at issue will be furthered or retarded by

the same reasons in ATA that prospective application here

of this Court and with the Twenty-first Amendment, and

what had been considered legitimate State taxation at that

time.

And as the Court noted in ATA, it is not the intent

of the Commerce Clause to prevent legitimate State

20

In light of this reliance interest and absolute lack of

any challenge to that state statute from 1939 until 1985,
