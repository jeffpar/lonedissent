MR. SOLOMONS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Black Lung Benefits Act provides a workers'

15

compensation-type benefit to coal miners and their

16

families on account of total disability or death due to

17

black lung disease.

the cases before the court, the fact finders have

determined that Mr. Dayton and Mr. Taylor do not have

20

black lung disease.

21

disease, but it was determined in his case that he had no

22

disability or impairment due to this disease at all.

23

The statute has no other purpose.

Mr. Pauley had an early stage of the

Dayton, Taylor, and Pauley nevertheless believe

24

that they are entitled to be compensated for totally

it.

2

inquiry in to the truth of the matters in their cases is,

3

they say, prohibited by Section 402(f)(2) of the Black

4

Lung Benefits Act, which they say required the Department

5

of Labor to write eligibility regulations that

6

irrebuttably presumed their entitlement to benefits.

7

Department of Labor wrote extremely liberal regulations

8

that presumed all of the hard parts of their cases, the

9

hard factual parts, in favor of the claimants.

10

The reason that they give is that a fair factual

The

But those

presumptions are not irrebuttable.

11

The questions that have been presented here this

12

morning are, first, whether Section 402(f)(2) of the Black

13

Lung Act required the Department of Labor to enact such

14

irrebuttable presumptions, and secondly, if that — if it

15

did, whether Section 402(f)(2) is constitutionally viable

16

to the extent that it irrebuttably and retroactively

17

imposes upon these mine operators the obligation to pay

18

for harm that either they did not cause or that does not

19

exist.

20

We do not believe that it is necessary to reach

21

the due process questions presented because Section

22

402(f)(2) does not prohibit factual inquiry into the truth

23

in these cases.

24

in its context leads to several key conclusions.

If these cases that are here before you today

had almost 20 years ago been presented to the Social

6

Security Administration based upon the records that are

8

The claims processors working for that agency would not

9

have ignored the relevant and persuasive evidence that

10

these people did not have pneumoconiosis or any related

11

disability.

12

The only thing that we can document that the

13

Social Security Administration really did differently is

14

that it did not do much to defend black lung claims.

15

wrote regulations, as did the Department of Labor, that

16

presumed all of these hard parts of the case in favor of

17

the claimant, but it made no effort, or almost no effort,

to assume the burden that it placed upon itself.

QUESTION;

Mr. Solomons, would it have been open

to such proof under the old HEW regulations?
MR. SOLOMONS:

Justice O'Connor, we think that

the old HEW regulations were clearly open to such proof.

We're talking — if we're — we're talking here —

QUESTION;

9

MR. SOLOMONS:
QUESTION:

10
11

They don't talk about it directly.
They talk about it indirectly.

In fact, it is not clear, I think,

what would have happened under those old regulations.

12

MR. SOLOMONS:

Justice O'Connor, I think that

13

that may be correct, and it's — they're very difficult to

14

read.

16

nevertheless, they do not say that they are irrebuttable.

17

They're messy and complex regulations that were
But

And through the cross-references, which is

18

apparently the way the Social Security Administration

19

regulated in those days, you get to, and not on a very

20

hard path, you get to provisions within those regulations

21

that raise criteria that are identical to those criteria

22

that the Department of Labor put in its regulations.

23

Department of Labor's regulations are neater.

24

Department of Labor's regulations are designed for

adversary proceedings.

The

And I think in all of the attention this has

1
2

gotten, and not only from this Court — and this Court has

3

had this before it three times and there is a fourth case

4

waiting in the wings, and the courts of appeals have seen

5

it many times — one thing that we have not yet focussed

6

upon in looking at and comparing the Social Security

7

regulations with the Department of Labor's regulations is

8

that they are designed for different audiences and for

9

different purposes.

The Department of Labor's regulation

10

is designed for adversary proceedings and for application

11

by judges, administrative law judges or other judges.
QUESTION:

12

Yes, but nevertheless, whatever they

13

are designed for, Congress has said that the Department of

14

Labor should not have regulations any stricter than the —

15

than HEW.

16

MR. SOLOMONS:

17

QUESTION:

That's right.

So if you could rebut — if you

18

couldn't rebut the case under the Social Security

19

regulations by evidence that the Department of Labor

20

permits — isn't that one of the claims in this case?

21

MR. SOLOMONS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SOLOMONS:

That is the claim.

Yes.

Every single one of them.

QUESTION:

All you have to do is follow

But as I said —
Well, do we know how it was applied

by HEW?
MR. SOLOMONS:

6

What we do know — now there are

7

-- there are very few cases that arise out of the Social

8

Security program.

9

100 or 200 published decisions out of 600,000 cases.

I think there are probably no more than

10

There are a couple of cases which, which show that the

11

Social Security Administration, at least when they got to

12

court, never treated this presumption as being exclusive

13

of anything.

It was just an administrative rule.

14

And one of the cases we cited, Farmer v.

15

Weinberger, the agency came in and argued that you

16

rebutted a death claim under the part that says rebuttal.

17

In another case, much later on, they came in and they did,

18

as we suggest, apply a primary reason test to disability

19

causation.

20

There are very few cases.
But what we do know, and we readily concede that

21

the factual issues that are presented in these kinds of

22

cases are difficult ones, and they cannot be decided

23

without expert testimony, without medical evidence.

24

Social Security Administration did not get the kind of

25

expert testimony that exists in these cases.

been able to find that show that these presumptions were

And it seems that that's what they would have

8

9

done in these kinds of cases, except that the agency, it

10

said because it lacked resources, it said because there

11

were not enough testing facilities in coal mining regions,

12

it said that these were very hard questions and they

13

didn't really know exactly how to resolve them, and so

14

they didn't do anything.

But let me suggest to you that that is not a

criterion.

that is picked up by this statute.

if in fact he has a respiratory impairment, is not due to

QUESTION:

MR. SOLOMONS:

QUESTION:

7

MR. SOLOMONS:

That is hard evidence.
Or causation.

That is disability --

Disability causation.

— caused by it.
That's right.

It is hard to show

8

but by no means impossible.

9

it is hard to show that an individual who has pulmonary

10

impairment, whether that impairment in fact arose out of

11

the miner's coal mine employment, that's hard too.

12

the agency didn't do it.

13

They reported to Congress that they didn't do it and that

14

they couldn't do it, and that they didn't have the

15

resources.

16

QUESTION:

It's shown all the time, but

But

They said they didn't do it.

You say that's why the Social

17

Security people resolved cases the way they did, not

18

because of an irrebuttable presumption, but because there

19

was no evidence supporting the other view?

MR. SOLOMONS:

Well, they created a presumption

for use by their claims personnel, which to me looks to

some degree like the Social Security grid.

But the way the regulation is set up, and the

That's not the way the Labor presumption worked,

We think that the Labor presumption is less

probably had to be, because there was going to be

adversity in these cases, and Labor knew that.

not need to be precise in designing a standard for

We think that the Labor

This is not a case where the Labor Department

was told to do, and the Labor Department, I think,

favoring claimants at a time when the agency itself was

very much in favor of this legislation, the Labor

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

DIRECTOR, OWCP, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
MR. WRIGHT:

12

13

Very well, Mr. Solomons.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

Justice O'Connor, in response to your question,

15

we know relatively little about how HEW administered the

16

program, but let me call to your attention two things that

17

we do know that were reported in one of the GAO reports

18

and in the congressional legislative history.

19

reported that in cases where the record before it showed

20

that a miner died from an automobile accident or from a

21

malignancy in another organ of the body, it did not award

22

benefits.

23

done the same thing in a case where the evidence —

24
25

HEW

We think that that shows that it would have

QUESTION:

And how do we know that?

QUESTION:

We have cited both of

Did the GAO report deal with the

black lung program in the Social Security agency?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

7

And Justice White, in response to your question,

8

you paraphrase Section 402(f)(2) in a way that I know we

9

sometimes do, that it said that Labor was to adopt HEW's
What Section 402(f)(2) actually says is that

10

regulation.

11

Labor is to apply criteria no more restrictive than those

12

applicable on June 30, 1973.

13

Now, HEW's regulation was applicable on that

14

date, but so was — so were many other things, including

15

part B of the act generally.

16

fact that the act provides repeatedly that black lung

17

benefits are only to be awarded to persons who are totally

18

disabled due to pneumoconiosis.

19

pneumoconiosis" captures both the requirement that the

20

miner must have the disease, and the requirement that his

21

disability must be caused by the disease.

22

QUESTION:

And I'd like to focus on the

The phrase "due to

Well, then, I suppose it would follow

23

that if the regulations didn't provide for rebuttal on

those — either one of those two bases, the regulation

would be contrary to the statute?

MR. WRIGHT:

1

That's our position exactly,

2

Justice White.

The first section of the Black Lung

3

Benefits Act says that its purpose is to provide benefits

4

to miners totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.

5

section authorizing HEW to promulgate regulations says

6

that it is to set forth standards to determine whether a

7

miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.

8

schedules have a provision for miners totally disabled due

9

to pneumoconiosis.

The

The rate

No provision of the act hints that

10

anyone who is — does not have black lung disease or is

11

disabled by some other cause is entitled to benefits.

12

three words, due to pneumoconiosis, in effect summarize

13

Labor's third and fourth rebuttal provisions, the

14

provisions at issue in this case.

15

regulation that implements the statute is contrary to the

16

statute.

17

The

We don't think that a

Dayton and Taylor, who do not have the disease,

do not suggest any reason why they should be entitled to

benefits.

benefits because it's too difficult to determine what

21

caused the disability.

23

Congress clearly thought that it was possible.

Pauley suggests that she should be awarded

this program.

2

The automobile accident hypothetical reveals a lot in our

3

view.

4

benefits should not be awarded in such a case, and it

5

seems quite clear to us that Congress did not intend such

6

a result, which can fairly be characterized as absurd

7

under the statute.

8
9

In many cases it is obviously quite simple.

The claimants have absolutely no argument as to why

QUESTION:

Let's acknowledge, Mr. Wright,

however, that it's very — it's very hard to get there

10

through the HEW regulations.

11

companies don't even agree on how you get there through

the HEW regulations.

Of course it's hard to get anywhere

provision that sets forth an irrebuttable presumption for

that presumption was affirmant of the due process clause.

That's Section 422(c) of the act, which says that no

MR. HENRIQUES:

Well, as we say in Mr. Taylor's

14

brief, it turns on the specific word "criteria" in the

15

statute, and the distinction between substantive criteria

16

on the one hand and forms of evidence on the other.

17

since blood gas studies show the same fact element, the

18

presence of a respiratory or pulmonary impairment, the

19

same fact element that ventilatory studies show, we

20

believe that DOL later, when it no longer was futile to

establish standards for blood gas studies, had to apply

the same criteria with respect to blood gas study cases as

it did with respect to ventilatory study cases.

The regulations are not the model of clarity, but

they're clear enough to be able to ascertain that there's

simply no permissible interpretation that would allow the

read into them.

15

Now, first with respect to the statutory

The two additional rebuttal tests of the DOL regulation

QUESTION:

Your opponents disagree with you as

to the rebuttability of the HEW systems, don't they?
MR. HENRIQUES:

They do.

They contend that this

regulation is confusing, can be read to include provisions

8

like the two extra rebuttal tests of the DOL interim

9

regulation, and they offer varying readings of the HEW

10

interim provision that contradict each other.

11

the readings that they offer is a permissible

12

interpretation of the HEW interim provision.

13

interim provision is carefully scrutinized in light of

14

HEW's own interpretation of it in its Coal Miners Benefits

They try to press the superficial point in their briefs.

2

The legislative rule-making authority that Congress had

3

delegated HEW was well broad enough, certainly broad

4

enough to allow SSA to decide to conclusively presume

5

facts.

6

Now, when we say conclusively presume, it's

7

different than irrebuttability.

8

rebuttable.

9

not directly related — directly related to disability

10
11

This regulation was

It was rebuttable by certain facts that were

causation or the presence of pneumoconiosis.
But SSA believed that it was permissible to

12

indirectly prove these facts, based on a miner who has

13

pneumoconiosis and who is totally disabled would prove

14

these facts by a conclusive presumption based on — based

15

on these facts.

16

Now the reason that SSA decided to do that was

17

because it had come to the realization or the belief,

18

based on study — HEW's officials and medical officers

19

believed that the state of the medical art simply was not

20

advanced far enough at the time to be able to allow fact

21

finders and physicians to make reasoned determinations

22

concerning the element of disability causation.

QUESTION:

And — let's assume that the state of

you really can determine causation.

nevertheless, that until Congress changes the act you have

2

to go by the HEW regulation.

3

MR. HENRIQUES:

Well, more than that.

Congress

decided in Section 402(f)(2) of the act to incorporate the

HEW interim provision.

6

of Labor cannot apply criteria more restrictive than the

most favorable regulations to claimants at the time.

You can't — it's very difficult for legislatures

and agencies which legislatively rule make to draw precise

9

But again, I'd like to emphasize that the

10

Government and the coal industries have access to all the

11

files in all the cases, and they haven't shown you

12

evidence of even one case in which a claim was even filed

13

that had — that was based on an accident of any kind,

much less a car accident claim.

Mr. Henriques, I didn't think that

invented.

They

1

haven't backed it up with even any indication that there

2

was ever such a claim filed.

3

Besides deciding that its interim provision

would conclusively presume disability causation, HEW also

5

decided that it would conclusively presume the presence of

6

pneumoconiosis in ventilatory study cases.

7

QUESTION:

As we —

May I just clarify one thing?

When

8

you say "conclusively presume," is that a term that is

9

used in either the HEW regulation or the manual that you -

the presumption get a presumption that they are totally

Yes, but as I remember the text of

the regulation, it does not say that the presumption is

irrebuttable or conclusive.

8

MR. HENRIQUES:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HENRIQUES:

10

It doesn't use those words

— but it all but uses the words

11

because it specifically says that you obtain the

12

presumption by invoking the presumption, and then when you

13

look at rebuttal there is no rebuttal test that addresses

14

directly, or indirectly —

15

QUESTION:

No, that's true, but supposing, for

you can rebut claims in ways that are not spelled out as

would be that you list two rebuttal tests, you certainly

And it was certainly within HEW's reasonable exercise of

QUESTION:

Yes, but —

QUESTION:

Well, how is it reasonable, though,

to draw a line that is contrary to the whole thrust of the

I just don't understand how such a regulatory

scheme could possibly be deemed a reasonable

11

interpretation of the statute.

MR. HENRIQUES:

The — one of the judgments that

an agency would make is what's the likelihood that there

will be cases that would win for, with respect to

undeserving clients.

16

that's perfect.

no evidence that any such person ever received benefits,

thing that troubles me about your argument is that all

2

this uncertainty means that once the miner gets the

3

benefit of the presumption he is normally going to win,

4

because the uncertainty makes it very difficult to rebut

5

the presumption.

6

But if you do have the unusual case in which the

7

evidence clearly establishes the absence of the disease or

8

the absence of causation, it seems to me there it's rather

9

unusual to say we just won't permit the rebuttal to come

10

in.

Because then the miner is getting not only the

11

benefit of the uncertainty, but the benefit of a

12

conclusive presumption that I don't see mentioned anywhere

13

in any of the materials.

14

MR. HENRIQUES:

Well, the agency had to — did

15

take that into consideration, and the Comptroller

General's report that talks about HEW's decisions in this

regard makes it clear just how difficult it is to tell

pneumoconiosis apart from other conditions.

perhaps also now, to be able to allow the determination to

2

be made as to whether -- that it wasn't pneumoconiosis.

3

And so HEW made the reasonable decision that we're going

4

to look at the reasonable connection between having

5

pneumoconiosis and being totally disabled, and saying that

6

the reasonable connection is that the disability occurred.

7

In other words, proving the fact of disability causation

8

indirectly was, in their view, more — a more accurate

9

endeavor than to try to allow physicians to prove it

10

directly when the state of the medical art did not allow

11

that determination.
The other point, and HEW also was under

12

13

instructions from Congress.

Congress clearly encouraged

14

HEW to eliminate this huge backlog of claims using interim

15

criteria.

16

one of the primary causes for this backlog of claims was

the — this inadequacy in the state of the medical art to

MR. HENRIQUES:

The — but again, nothing would

8

have prevented physicians from issuing decisions that HEW

9

had already determined could not be accurate.

If they

10

believe that the state of the medical art is inadequate,

11

and physicians nevertheless, an individual physician in an

12

individual case is asked to write an opinion, that opinion

13

may be one that says — like in these cases — that says

14

that the disability causation didn't happen, or the

15

presence of pneumoconiosis was not there when they

focussed on diseases that HEW said you can't tell from

made with respect to the GAO study.

8

it is of limited significance, nevertheless, this was an

investigation by the investigative arm of Congress.

Although I think that

They

10

came in, they leveled charges at the agency, said you're

not doing these things that you ought to be doing.

12

the agency came back and they said, oh, well, it's real

13

hard to do them, and we don't have the resources to do

14

them.

And

15

And then on the medical issues they said that —

16

and this, by the way, as far as we know, never appeared in

17

any congressional materials — they said, citing a

18

magazine article, that it's very difficult to make these
