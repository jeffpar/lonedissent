CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Kimerling?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH KIMERLING

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KIMERLING:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a narrow issue under the

10
11

Court's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, an issue important

12

not only the petitioner here but to every other Puerto

13

Rican and Latino in this county.

14

boils down to whether or not after a prima facie case of

15

discrimination in the selection of jurors, a prosecutor

16

can respond by simply saying, I did not exclude Latino

17

jurors because they were Latino.

18

because they speak and understand Spanish.

19

The issue in this case

I excluded these jurors,

The way that this issue arises in this case,

20

Your Honors, is as follows.

21

The prosecutor excluded every Latino juror that came

22

before him, using his peremptory challenges.

23

prima facie case of discrimination was established under

24

Batson.

25

for excluding Latino jurors.

The petitioner was on trial.

Thus a

The prosecutor was called on to give his reasons

At that point the prosecutor said that he and

1
2

the court had questioned the jurors about an instruction

3

to follow an interpreter.

4

testimony in Spanish.

5

whether or not -- the jurors — whether or not they could

6

disregard what the witness was going to say in Spanish and

7

rely only on the English language rendition of that

8

testimony provided by the interpreter.

9

QUESTION:

There was going to be some

And in essence he was asking them

Well, now, if that reason is true

10

that that was the basis for the prosecutor's strike, are

11

you arguing that there can be no peremptory strike on that

12

basis?
MR. KIMERLING:

13

That's correct, Your Honor.

14

argue that is a per se violation of Batson, given that

15

reason.

16

If I might just continue to give you —

17

QUESTION:

Well, that's rather a remarkable

18

position to take, isn't it?

I mean ordinarily if, if a

19

prosecutor is aware that there's going to some foreign

20

language translation required, and if the prosecutor

21

thinks that some particular perspective juror will not

22

abide by the translation of the language and yet speaks

23

the language, I think it's quite remarkable to say that

24

there cannot be a peremptory challenge, maybe even a

25

challenge for cause --

QUESTION:

3

MR. KIMERLING:

We don't —

**\

— on that basis.
Your Honor, we don't -- we don't

4

dispute the opportunity challenge for cause, but we do

5

argue, as you said, that a prosecutor could not exercise a

6

peremptory challenge.

7

that rule should be applied.

8

the prosecutor has not learned anything about the

9

individual juror.

And if I might explain why I think
It's very clearly because

The prosecutor has learned simply that

10

this juror has, as other bilingual jurors, an

11

understanding of Spanish that the --

12

QUESTION:

Well, isn't —

13

QUESTION:

There was some evidence here I

14

thought that the prosecutor challenge was based some of

15

the reaction of the particular jurors to the questions.

16

MR. KIMERLING:

The prosecutor here said that he

17

believed that these jurors were hesitant in their

18

responses in that they said that I will try to follow that

19

instruction.

20

jurors affirmed that they could and would —

Later, I must say that all these -- both

21

QUESTION:

Well —

22

MR. KIMERLING:

23

QUESTION:

-- follow the instruction.

But didn't the trial judge find that

24

the prosecutor stated reason was his real reason?

25

that a finding of the trial court judge?

2

Your Honor, but he did deny the motion.

3

arguing, Your Honor, that the reason stated was not his

4

reason.

QUESTION:

We are not

We assume in deciding this cased that

the stated reason was his real reason.

7

_

He made no specific finding,

MR. KIMERLING:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

8

we believe that the real reason is the Spanish language

9

ability of these jurors.

10

QUESTION:

Well, do you —

11

QUESTION:

But then you're not accepting it.

12

Go ahead, Justice.

13

QUESTION:

Do you understand Batson to require

14

some kind of disparate impact analysis as opposed to a

15

finding of intention discrimination?

16

MR. KIMERLING:

No, we don't, Your Honor.

17

— it does require finding an intent.

18

issue here is essentially that these jurors answered the

19

questions in the way that every other bilingual juror

20

would.

21

difficulty that bilingual jurors face in giving, as an

22

initial response, anything more than I will try, is an

23

honest response.

1

bilingual jurors react exactly the same way?

2

MR. KIMERLING:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It is a

3

form of stereotype, but it's an appropriate one in this

4

setting, because — let me examine — let us examine

5

what's being asked of these jurors.

6

This Court has, on a number of occasions,

7

recognized the difficulty that jurors generally have in

8

disregarding things that are said in court, evidence

9

that's been provided in court even when instructed to do

10

so by the judge.

11

what these bilingual jurors had been asked to do.

12

had been asked, essentially, to disregard the words of the

13

witness from his or her mouth that they understand and

14

take instead an English language rendition of that.

15

It's particularly difficult for -- to do

To do so creates two problem in minimum for

One, it runs against their natural

QUESTION:

But this -- this is true in any case,

19

when you've got a juror who is bilingual.

20

nothing peculiar to the situation in which the juror

21

happens to speak the same language as one of the witnesses

22

who is a member of the ethnic group that includes the

23

defendant.

MR. KIMERLING:
absolutely right.

I mean, there's

That's our argument.

That's

demonstrated or the — or the I-will-try answers here are

2

the kinds of answers that would be given by every

3

bilingual juror —

QUESTION:

Yeah, but —

5

MR. KIMERLING:

— who honestly — excuse me --

6

who honestly reflects on the questions that he's being

7

asked to answer.

8

9

Excuse me, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, what if — so what.

These may

be that kind of an answer, but I thought your argument was

10

that — that it amounts to intentional discrimination

11

based on race or ethnic origin to say that because you're

12

bilingual, you can't sit on this jury.

13
14
15

MR. KIMERLING:

That's absolutely correct, that

that relying —
QUESTION:

To say that intentionally excluding a

16

juror by peremptory challenge because the juror is

17

bilingual —

18

MR. KIMERLING:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

That's correct.

— is a discrimination based on race

or ethnic origin.
MR. KIMERLING:

The connection between national

22

origin and language is a clear one, Your Honor.

23

something that — that this Court has looked to and relied

24

on in Yu Cong Eng --

It is

1

assume that the witness or that a juror is from a certain

2

— from a certain section of a foreign country, now a

3

nationalized citizen, but that foreign country has all

4

sorts of areas in it and people speak a different kind of

5

language in each area.

6

-- different nuances -- dialects.

7

do you think that a juror then should be required to

8

follow the official translations?

9

MR. KIMERLING:

I mean, they have a little nuances
Don't you think the --

We don't dispute that in the

10

least, Your Honor.

These jurors said that they would and

11

could and the court is — would presume that they would

12

follow the court's instructions.
What we're saying is that initially, in response

13
14

to these questions, the hesitancy that triggered the

15

exclusion of these jurors is the natural and foreseeable

16

hesitancy that would be found in all bilingual people.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you've — you've argued the

18

case as if the juror was being asked to completely

19

disregard what he or she heard.

20

that's what the prosecutor said.

21

sure that they would accept the interpreter as the final

22

arbiter, that is to say if there was, I suppose, some

23

dispute in the person's mind as to what he said.

24

that's different from saying that he must disregard every

25

nuance.

But I'm not quite sure if
He said, I want to be

That's quite different it seems to me.

Now,

We don't

1

-- and incidentally I take it we don't have the actual

2

transcript of what went on in the voir dire?

3

MR. KIMERLING:

We do not, Your Honor.

But the

4

instructions that — that normally accompany an

5

interpreter are just that, that you have to disregard what

6

you hear in Spanish and rely on what you hear in English.

7

The problem —

8

QUESTION:

Well, the prosecutor here said, I was

9

uncertain as to whether they could accept the interpreter

10

as the final arbiter, and it seems to me that's different

11

than saying completely disregard what you've heard.

12

MR. KIMERLING:

Well, I don't know if it makes a

13

distinction in the minds of the juror, Your Honor, because

14

what's at issue is whether or not they can essentially

15

screen out what it is that they hear in Spanish.

16

don't — I don't think that that's an easy process to do,

17

and I obviously the literature that we have cited to in

18

our briefs, one empirical study and a number of

19

linguistics -- experts have -- studies have demonstrated

20

that it's very difficult to do just that — to identify at

21

some point what it is you've heard in one language as it

22

opposed to another, because it's coming in.

23

something that you're going to understand.

24
25

And I

It's

And what I — what I don't want this Court to
believe is that we think that -- that a juror has a right

1

to disregard what the interpreter says.

2

that.

3

that they would rely on what the interpreter said.

4

we're saying is that this initial response will impact on

5

every bilingual juror.

6

These — these jurors agree that they could and

QUESTION:

All

That's what I have some difference

7

with you, because that's all that the prosecutor was

8

asking that you would accept the interpretation.

9

said, I had great uncertainty -- a great deal of

10

12

And he

uncertainty as to whether or not they could do that.

11

MR. KIMERLING:

They said that they would try,

and then they affirmed that they would.

13

QUESTION:

And I --

He's entitled to interpret their

14

demeanor evidence to perhaps cast doubt on their

15

assurances.

16

MR. KIMERLING:

Your Honor, if — if that's the

17

distinction, then I don't think it's a very meaningful one

18

in most settings.

19

prosecutor to these initial hesitant responses anytime

20

you'd want to, it means that — that you can eliminate

21

bilingual Latino jurors from a jury anytime you want to.

22

QUESTION:

If, in fact, you can point as a

Mr. Kimerling, there you're — you

23

have to rely on the trial judge.

I mean, you really have

24

two questions here, but you're only raising the second

25

one.

The first question is is the prosecutor's reason
11

/

We're not saying

1

that he gives really the true reason why he made the

2

strike.

3

the trial judge can say, no, I don't believe the

4

prosecutor.

5

I think you really wanted just to get rid of all the

6

Latinos.

7

you.

8

9

And here you concede that that's correct.

Now,

You said it was the witnesses' hesitancy, but

But here the finding on credibility is against

MR. KIMERLING:

Your Honor, we think that it's a

per se violation, that credibility has nothing to do with

10

it.

11

jurors, the prosecutor's relying on the Spanish language

12

ability of these jurors.

13

That by relying on the I-will-try answers of these

The court of appeals, for example, recognized

14

that these jurors answered in the way they did as a result

15

of their Spanish language ability.

16

language ability makes it difficult for every other

17

bilingual person to answer these questions.

18

QUESTION:

And that same Spanish

Well, except that the correlation is

19

never going to be what you say it is, because in the first

20

place, as I understand, somewhere in the briefs, the

21

statement is made that about 25 percent of those who are

22

ethnically Latino do not speak Spanish.

23

you've got a class of 25 percent right off the bat, if

24

that's correct, it will not be eliminated.

25

So you've —

And in addition to that, you cannot assume that

1

in every case in which there maybe a Latino defendant

2

there is going to be a translation problem.

3

have another category that's eliminated.

4

eliminate those two categories from your argument for

5

correlation, you don't have an argument that this

6

particular criterion is going to eliminate every Latino

7

juror.

8

9

MR. KIMERLING:
absolutely correct.

.So you then

And once you

Your Honor, I -- you're

And we're not trying to argue that.

10

What we're arguing is that in cases in which there is

11

going to be testimony in Spanish or maybe testimony in

12

Spanish, a prosecutor with the will to do so can simply

13

ask these same kinds of questions, get these same types of

14

hesitant I-will-try responses, rely on those, and knock

15

out those jurors.

16

QUESTION:

But you're now telling us that even

17

on the assumption that that is the prosecutor's real

18

reason and not merely a covert reason to eliminate an

19

ethnic group, that that cannot be done.

20

reason you were telling us that could not be done is that

21

it would effectively eliminate or give prosecutors the

22

opportunity to eliminate, in this particular case, every

23

Latino juror from a case in which there's a Latino

24

defendant.

25

And I thought the

And we know that's not so.
MR. KIMERLING:

Your Honor, the -- there is no

1

difference between somebody who does it unconsciously and

2

somebody who does it consciously.

3

you're relying on a trait of national origin to accomplish

4

what you want.

The effect is that

For example, if this prosecutor had said, I did

5
6

not exclude these jurors because they're Latino.

I

7

excluded them because they have Spanish surnames.

8

I've had real bad luck with Spanish surname jurors.

9

Spanish surnames doesn't include all Latinos.

And

It includes

10

people who are not Latino, who — many women who marry

11

Latino men, yet I think it would not be -- that this Court

12

would find under Batson that that would be a violation of

13

Batson.

14

QUESTION:

Well, then the question is, what is

15

the permissible criterion and what is a impermissible one?

16

I think I infer from your earlier remarks that it's proper

17

for the judge to instruct the jurors, if you can

18

understand this foreign language, I am instructing you

19

that you must abide by what the interpreter said.

20

the record in this case, and that's how you must decide

21

this case.

22

jury that?

Do you agree that the judge could instruct the

23

MR. KIMERLING:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Now, suppose a juror says, well,

judge, I can't do that.

can't do that.

For cause.

For cause or peremptory either way.
For cause, because he says I

I won't do that.

QUESTION:

Then —

Well, I — suppose he says, I have —

I'm just not sure I can do that.

I'll have great

difficulty doing that.
MR. KIMERLING:

And if in the context of that

12

voir dire, he concedes that he will and can, our position

13

is that it makes no difference between that juror and one

14

shows less hesitancy.

15

still based on the language ability of that juror, and as

16

such, would impact and effectively mean that — the

17

prosecutor in that same setting, if I might go back and

18

respond a little clearer — there's another juror in that

19

case, too, who just says, I'll try.

20

you'll have to do more than try, you'll have to do it.

21

And I'll do it.

So you have at one end of the spectrum

I don't think this Court can distinguish between
those, or any court can distinguish between those, when

1

it's a peremptory challenge, because the prosecutor has to

2

do more than point to a reason for his peremptory

3

challenge.

In both cases, he'd have a reason.
QUESTION:

4

Well, it's a very odd proposition

5

that you concede that an instruction from the court, a

6

direction from the court, is correct, that it's binding.

7

And then you say that a prosecutor cannot either for cause

8

or peremptorily excuse a juror who can't comply with that.

9

I'm

—

MR. KIMERLING:

10

We don't argue that he can't for

11

cause, but we argue that by allowing a prosecutor to do it

12

with peremptory challenges, allows him in essence to

13

exclude any time he wants — in which there — anytime —

14

in a trial, as Judge Souter pointed out — Justice Souter

15

pointed out — where there's going to be testimony in

16

Spanish, a bilingual Latino.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that just sounds to me like a

18

rule applying a disparate impact analysis as opposed to a

19

finding of intentional discrimination.

20

asking us for a — some kind of a blanket rule, based on

21

disparate impact on Latinos.

MR. KIMERLING:

I think you're

I am not, Your Honor, and if I

hesitancy that that individual black juror showed -- AfroAmerican juror showed — and his or her responses.
Secondly, I think the distinction that — that
in that case, there was a case-specific fact that is going
to be resolved by those jurors, that is, whether or not
this identification is accurate.

In our case, it is not.

There is no issue presented in this case or cases in which
testimony is being provided in Spanish that is at issue.
It's not as if it's a case-specific issue.
And thirdly, there's a showing of specific bias,
and by that I mean the — in the hypothetical case, the
black African-American juror, demonstrates a potential
bias against the prosecution or -- or favor for the
defendant.
In our case, the juror shows neither a -- bent
— a partial bias for the defendant or an antithesis —
antithetical position to the State.

I think that is what

really separates ours, and why we think it's very narrow.
While it's very important, it's very narrow at the same
time.

We do not encompass disparate impact.

And I think

it's my hypothetical —

QUESTION:

Well, but it isn't always.

MR. KIMERLING:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

And it may well be true that the

prosecutor is 100 percent sincere in believing that people
-- if he's had bad experience with the people with Latino
names.
MR. KIMERLING:

Well, I think the difference is

that we're looking at traits in the Fourteenth Amendment
context that have led to discrimination.

After all, the

most derogatory remark directed at Latinos is spic, and
that comes from — from a — a characterization of how
somebody might say I speak English, based on language.
The Congress has enacted numbers of provisions
and regulatory agencies to protect language minorities.
Spanish surname is a basis by which the census counts
Latinos.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kimerling, I think that

hypothetical would come out the way you do — the way you
suggest, that is, that it would be in violation of Batson.
But it — to my mind, it — that would be the result only
because no, no trial judge in his right mind would believe
that argument.

MR. KIMERLING:

Your Honor, it's not a question

of motive being good or bad.

It's a question about

whether the answer is a neutral one, and we believe that
an answer based on language cannot be neutral under the
Fourteenth Amendment and under Batson.
Quickly turning to point two — I'm sorry.
Obviously we think we have per se violation here.

We

think the plenary review, therefore, is appropriate by
this Court.

not find per se -- consistently applied the independent
review in jury discrimination cases starting in Norris -with Norris v. Alabama in 1935 continuing right up to the
present.

We don't think that it any reason not to comply

No, but you're not conceding that the

No.
No.

You could, for example, have a

prejudice against bank employees or something like that
and just challenge all those.
MR. COHEN:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

And once

again in this Court's expression in Holland v. Illinois,
for example, of its concern about extending the Sixth
Amendment — applying a Batson analysis to Sixth Amendment
cases and its reference in Batson to cognizable racial
groups indicates that what the Court meant in Batson was
to prohibit discrimination under the Equal Protection
Clause.

And I would believe that the kinds of

characteristics that this Court would prohibit would be
those kinds of characteristics that this Court has said
reflect an intent to discriminate under equal protection,
such as race or national origin.
And those characteristics can operate in two
ways.

First, the prosecutor can offer them as the reason

and this Court has clearly said that that reason on its
face is a violation of Batson.

But second, the prosecutor

can offer another reason that is race neutral on its face,

Well, no, Your —

you're going.
MR. COHEN:

No, Your — it would seem to me

appropriate in that particular case for the Court to

conclude that the prosecutor had intended to discriminate.

7

But if there is evidence before the court that the

8

prosecutor did not in fact intend to discriminate on the

9

basis of a prohibited characteristic like race or national

origin, then the use of that criteria would not be

prohibited by this Court's decision on that.

furnish very important evidence of intent, but in

substitutes for proof of an intent to discriminate,

proposition that Latinos, like other jurors, who actually
