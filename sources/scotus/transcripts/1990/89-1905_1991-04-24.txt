ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS DAWSON

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13
14
15

MR. DAWSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether local units of

16

government are going to be allowed to continue to regulate

17

the use of pesticides to protect the health and safety and

18

environment of their citizens, as they have been doing for

19

a great number of years, and certainly since the Congress

20

enacted the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide

21

Act almost 20 years ago.

22

The issue presented to this Court is did

23

Congress clearly intend to preempt local governments from

24

regulating pesticides when it enacted FIFRA.

25

respondents in this case claim that local governments can

The

1

do nothing, that they're powerless to protect their

2

citizens from pesticide hazards.

3

intended to strip local governments of this power, which

4

includes as much of a power as to simply require the

5

posting of warning signs on adjacent properties to warn

6

citizens to stay away from areas that have been treated by

7

pesticides.

8

I'd like to briefly --

9

QUESTION:

They claim Congress

Mr. Dawson, can -- just so I

10

understand, there is nothing in the position of the court

11

below that would prevent a State upon the petition of a

12

particular county, for example, from denominating that

13

county as a county in which some special provisions will

14

apply.

15

does not always have to act Statewide.

The State could do it.

MR. DAWSON:

16
17

That's true.

The State could do

that.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DAWSON:

20

It doesn't — the State

Okay.
And the State does not have to

respond affirmatively to such —

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DAWSON:

Well, of course.
I'd like to briefly review the

23

ordinance.

First the ordinance is not a pesticide

24

registration regulation.

25

make expert scientific decision entailed in the pesticides

It does not seek or require to

1

registration process that occurs under FIFRA.
Second, the ordinance applies to pesticide

2

3

spraying of public lands, private lands open to public

4

access, and aerial applications by aircraft.

5

talking about protecting areas frequented by people.

6

Third, the ordinance is expressly aimed at

We're

7

protecting private property, drinking water wells, and

8

other areas open to the public, like lakes and streams,

9

hunting grounds, play and recreation areas, and public

10

rights of way.
Fourth, the Town of Casey ordinance is a permit

11
12

ordinance.

It permits pesticide use under certain

13

circumstances and it allows the town board to impose

14

reasonable conditions.

15

spraying under windy conditions or it can create buffer

16

zones around play areas or school grounds to protect

17

children.

For example, it can prevent

True, permits under this ordinance may be

18
19

denied, but only after consideration of such things as the

20

benefits of the pesticide application, available

21

alternatives, and negative effects of denying the permit.

22

No permit has been denied under this ordinance.
QUESTION:

23

Does that ordinance regulate the same

24

things that FIFRA does or the State does under its

25

authority?

1

MR. DAWSON:

There could be some overlap, but I

2

think the emphasis here is that this ordinance, and

3

ordinances that have been passed like it, deal with things

4

that FIFRA does not do.

5

locality and dictate or provide conditions — protective

6

conditions for the protection of streams and playgrounds.

7

These are the things that people at the local level

8

understand.

9

the State capital are not going to be prepared to deal

10
11

FIFRA does not get down into the

Things that people in Washington or even at

with the way the Town of Casey -QUESTION:

Well, I take it that you wouldn't be

12

satisfied if we held that the only way a locality or a

13

town or a county could act on its own would be if the

14

State permitted it to do so.

15
16

MR. DAWSON:

That's very problematical, because

the State may not permit -- I'm sorry -- the State may not

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't be satisfied to

19

condition your right — to condition the town's authority

20

to pass this ordinance on -- the State giving it

21

permission to do so.

22

MR. DAWSON:

Well, in this case the State has

23

given the Town of Casey permission to pass general

24

ordinances under the police power to protect the local

25

governments.

QUESTION:

1

Well, I know in this specific — what

2

if it delegated to the county its power to regulate

3

pesticides?

4

MR. DAWSON:

If it's the kind of power that is

5

the power that their exercising now, fine.

6

the time — the kind of regulation being suggested by

7

respondents that the town is — has its hands tied to only

8

perform that which the State is going to do, then that's

9

going to be very serious and problematic.
QUESTION:

10
11

But if it's

So you would not be satisfied in

this?

12

MR. DAWSON:

13

QUESTION:

I would not.
Didn't one of the Wisconsin State

14

courts suggest that the town's ordinance was preempted or

15

at least unauthorized under State law?

16

MR. DAWSON:

The Washburn County Circuit Court

17

held that.

However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not

18

deal with that issue and only dealt --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DAWSON:

21

22

They expressed no view?
Simply ruled on the Federal

question.
The second part of this ordinance is the posting

23

requirement.

It simply says that the ordinance allows the

24

town board to require the posting of signs on treated

25

lands to warn citizens of the areas where the public may

go so that they can make their own decisions about whether

3

FIFRA really doesn't perform these kinds of

functions, nor was it really intended to do that.

Respondents attack the entire ordinance.

QUEST1ON:

9

They say the

Are all the things that the town did

here or proposes to be able to do, things that, if the

10

State itself were to do it, would be authorized under the

11

FIFRA scheme?

12

MR. DAWSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DAWSON:

15

QUESTION:

If I understand -Do you understand my question?
I'm not positive.
Is everything that the town asserts

16

its ordinance permits things that the FIFRA statute would

17

allow a State to do if the State were doing it at the

18

State level?

19

MR. DAWSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DAWSON:

If I understand -Is that not clear?
If I understand your question, I

22

believe the answer is yes.

23

free to regulate, it is free to do that which the State

24

could do.

QUESTION:

The town may regulate -- it is

Well, let me put it another way then,

because I guess you didn't understand.

2

made it clear.

3

allows certain State action with regard to the regulation

4

of pesticides.

5

I must not have

As I understand it, the Federal statute

Isn't that so?

MR. DAWSON:

Yes, that's correct.

24(a) in fact

6

7
8

QUESTION:

And is everything that you argue the

town can do here something that the Federal law permits?

9

MR. DAWSON:

Yes.

And that gets us to the act

10

itself.

I think the best place to start with looking at

11

the intent of Congress is the language of the statute.

12

And that's section 24 of FIFRA.

13

24(b) — I'm going to start with 24(b), because

14

that is the express preemption provision of this act, and

15

it only preempts State regulation with regard to pesticide

16

labeling and packaging.

17

as the preemption goes.

18

It is specific.

That is as far

We then move on to section 24(a) which is the

19

anti-preemption provision of the act.

20

respondents depend on the anti-preemption provision of

21

this act for the basis of their argument that local

22

governments are indeed preempted.

23

the State may regulate the sale or use of a federally

24

registered pesticide.

25

it is upon the history of this language that respondents

It's ironic that

Yet this act says that

It is upon this express language --

go to to make the argument that local governments are

2

preempted.

3

authorized to regulate that local governments are

4

preempted from regulating.

5

It does not follow that because States are

QUESTION:

Well, that depends upon — surely

6

that depends upon whether you think that the statute,

7

absent any references to States or municipalities, would

8

have preempted the States.

9

Suppose none of the sections that specifically authorize

What is your view on that?

10

States to do something had been included.

11

the type of a statute that is complete enough that we

12

would say this is the systemic regulation by the Federal

13

Government, and States are automatically precluded?

14

MR. DAWSON:

15

QUESTION:

NO.

No.

Would this be

I —

But that would make a difference.

If

16

you felt the other way on that -- if you felt that it were

17

that complete a statute, then unless there were specific

18

authorization for States and for municipalities they would

19

be precluded, right?

20

MR. DAWSON:

Except that in this case we have

21

24(b) which is a specific preemption provision.

22

your question assumes that 24(b) is still here?

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. DAWSON:

25

Yes.
Yes.

I assume

It assumes it's still there.
And I would say that in light

of the Congress specifically dealing with preemption and

going only this far that the States are free to distribute

2

their power to their local governments, to allow their

3

local governments to continue to regulate in this field,

that they in fact are not preempted.

MR. DAWSON:

There are approximately 400 to 500

citizens that live in the town of Casey.
QUESTION:

Large enough to pass the ordinance in

question.
MR. DAWSON:

Large enough to be authorized by

the State legislature to pass the ordinance, yes.
There are other provisions in FIFRA that also
suggest that Congress contemplated that there would be
local regulation.

In particular, I point to section 22,

which is 7 U.S.C. 136(t) of the act.

This act requires

the EPA administrator to cooperate with local units of
government in securing uniformity of regulations.

This

suggests that local governments are contemplated to have
the authority to regulate pesticides for which the EPA
should seek uniformity through cooperation not through
preemption.
Respondents rest their case heavily on the
legislative history of this case.
QUESTION:

MR. DAWSON:
QUESTION:

Mr. Dawson, before you get to that

Yes.
Did — has the State of Wisconsin

taken a position on this matter?

Some States have come in

on your side and some States have come in on the other
side.

MR. DAWSON:

The State Supreme Court held in a

4-3 decision that the Federal law preempts local

governments from regulating pesticides.

QUESTION:

I understand, but the executive of

the State has not intervened in this matter or filed

anything as an amicus?

9

MR. DAWSON:

That's correct.

There appears to

be no official position.
Going to the legislative history of the act.

We

started in the House.

11

Committee voted not to authorize local regulation and that

it's intent was to preempt.

not translate to an affirmative act by the full House to

history that's referred to on page 23 of the opposing

rather little for the preservation of State power for a

key factors.

5

First, the statutory language and the

congressional intent to preempt local regulation.

8

Congress expressly considered but rejected local

9

regulation.

Second, Congress created a Federal/State

10

scheme which is responsive to Federal, State, and local

11

needs.

12

pesticide regulation is more than simply a local concern

and must be subject to Federal and State control.

that scheme also allowed — also allows local needs to be

QUESTION:

Well, it's a little hard to find on

the face of this statute that the term "state" couldn't

were specifically authorized by the State there would be

no problem.

First, we have explicit statements from the

"The regulation by the Federal Government and the 50

States should be sufficient and should preempt the field,"

14

That comes out of a debate that occurred in both the House

15

and in the Senate.

But that language doesn't occur in a vacuum.

16

And when this matter was before the House, the

17

House had before it an administration proposal which

18

included in what latter became section 136v, a section

19

that said States and political subdivisions.

20

language was deleted by the House Agriculture Committee

21

when they concluded regulation by the Federal Government

22

and the 50 States should be sufficient and should preempt

2

I beg your pardon.

MR. KENT:

So that at this point, one not only

4

has to disregard the statutory language -- the definition,

5

the differentiation, but one also has to disregard the

6

fact that Congress expressly considered this question and

7

rejected petitioners' view point.
QUESTION:

11

Did the committee report refer to the

particular sub — sections and subsections you're talking
about?
MR. KENT:

Yes, I believe it did, Your Honor.

12

It was referring to the text of the bill, which would be

13

24(a) and 24(b).

16

QUESTION:

Indicating that it was those

particular sections or subsections which did preempt it?
MR. KENT:

Right, that was the Senate

Agriculture and Forestry Committee in particular.

18

what the Senate Commerce Committee attempted to do was to

19

amend that section by including political subdivisions.

20

And that amendment was rejected first by the Agriculture

21

and Forestry Committee and then ultimately their view

22

prevailed in the Senate.

I suppose that would apply to municipalities, too.

he can authorize municipalities to issue experimental use

conclusion of our argument.

2

QUESTION:

It's scary, isn't it?

3

MR. KENT:

We believe so, Your Honor.

4

To turn to two of the related problems that

5

would result in allowing local units of government to have

6

unfettered decision making in this area, we cited a number

7

of them in our brief and I would like to just highlight

8

two.

9

V

One is what I've referred to as the so-called

10

gypsy moth problem.

11

which can restrict pesticides in their area, they would

12

then be able to allow a noxious pest to grow and develop,

13

and then spread onto neighboring jurisdictions.

14

point, the neighboring jurisdictions not only have to use

15

more pesticides, but the pest is spread over a larger

16

area.

17

If you have local units of government

So that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Kent, we deal with any number of

18

preemption cases here, as you know, every year.

19

ordinarily if it's thought that there is no preemption,

20

the State and local governments are left in exactly the

21

same position as you say they should not be left in here.

22

Not only is the State free to regulate, but if State law

23

allows, the local unit is allowed to regulate.

24

a fairly normal consequence of a finding of no preemption.

3

QUESTION:

No, my point is that you're saying

look at what extravagant things might be — happen if the

various localities regulate this subject.

6

that possibility is opened up every time we hold that

7

there is no preemption by the Federal statute.

8

State governments can regulate, but ordinarily local units

9

can regulate.

10

MR. KENT:

And I'm saying

That's true, Your Honor.

Not only

But I would

11

submit that this is a particularly problematic area in the

12

pesticide area, because if a local unit of government is

13

allowed to restrict pesticides in its jurisdiction, that

14

problem isn't simply transferred in the same form to a

15

neighboring jurisdiction.

16

that makes the problem worse — that the pests grow --

that you have a larger area over which to control the

pests and the use of more pesticides.

MR. KENT:

I don't believe so, Your Honor, and

11

for this reason that the statutory scheme and as confirmed

12

by the legislative history here means that it is the State

13

which must be the ultimate regulatory jurisdiction.

14

QUESTION:

And that regulatory power cannot be

of cooperation do you understand that to be referring to?

3

MR. KENT:

What kind

I would see that in two respects,

4

Your Honor.

The first is the type of cooperation that

5

might come up in the context of where the State decides to

6

regulate a pesticide with respect to a particular local

7

area, as Wisconsin does, for example, in saying in certain

8

counties we have additional restrictions on the pesticide

aldicarb.

There you would want to have some contact and

10

cooperate with the local officials in, you know, setting

11

up the monitoring and in administering that program.

12

QUESTION:

I see.

13

MR. KENT:

I think another way of looking at it

14

would be the California model.

15

we will allow local units of government to do certain

16

things, and there's a specific delegation to those local

17

units of government, but the State retains control.

18

decision by, for example, the county Agricultural

19

Commissioner to issue a special use permit in California

20

is subject to specific review by the State in the State

21

Administrative Procedure Act.

22

The California model says,

A

Under the California scheme if a local unit of

23

government proposes a specific regulation for its area,

24

the State will allow that to happen provided there is an

25

express approval by the State.

Now, that type of a scheme

really allows the purposes of FIFRA to be served, because

it brings to that scheme not only the State expertise but

the type of coordination that you would have on a

Statewide level.

Statewide perspective so that some of the most parochial

problems can be then vetoed by the State effectively.

it's that State control which we think is key here, and

what Congress was intending to do as it set forth in the

MR. KENT:

Right, considerably more restrictive.

And again our concern here ultimately is with the
multiplicity of these types of regulations could
effectively preclude any use of pesticides by these
governments.
In concluding, I would just like to note that
congressional intent we believe remains the ultimate
touchstone here.

And we believe Congress established a

coordinated Federal and State program.

And it provided

that States can regulate use and defines States to
preclude local governments.

It underscored the different

roles between States and local governments, allowing
States to cooperate and participate in those State
programs.
And I think as the words of the statute say, in
carrying out the provisions of this chapter, they can
assist in a State program.

But they cannot we submit

under this statute and this legislative history be
involved in a case where they can do so wholly independent
