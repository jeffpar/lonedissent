MR. ALLRED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Cert, was granted in this case on whether a

claim for violation in Age Discrimination in Employment

Act is subject to compulsory arbitration.

20

Mitsubishi and its trilogy, and then on the other hand is

21

the national policy of eradicating employment

This case focuses on a conflict between

MR. ALLRED:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ALLRED:

Now, I take it you

That was not relied upon by you

That is correct.

That is correct.

Why not?
Well, because in the — first off,

8

we thought that the Mitsubishi — I mean, that the

9

Gardner-Denver line of cases were dispositive of the

10

Federal arbitration issue, and in fact — apd we — we

11

looked at Tenney, the circuit court case, and the cases

12

that followed that, and we did not appreciate the

13

importance of that argument.

14

from the AFL-CIO and the AARP and the other amicus we are

15

convinced that it is indeed a compelling argument.
QUESTION:

16

In looking at the briefs

Well, do you think we should address

17

it here in this Court, and are you prepared to have us do

18

so?

19

MR. ALLRED:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ALLRED:

We think -And to argue the issue?
Justice O'Connor, we think that the

22

enforceability of the agreement under the FAA — if you're

23

going to look at the Federal Arbitration Act, you of

24

necessity have to look at section 1.

25

me that that issue is subsumed within the entire question

And so it seems to

1

that is before this Court.

2

at that particular issue it seems to me that the plain

3

language of section 1 that says that workers — that all

4

classes of workers engaged in interstate commerce are

5

excluded from the act is dispositive of the question on

6

the basis of the plain language of the statute.

7

But furthermore, when you look at the — at the

8

legislative history of that act, which when — was gone

9

into in great detail in the brief of the AFL-CIO, it was

10

— it showed to me beyond all question that, it was

11

intended that employment contracts or employment disputes

12

were to be excluded, and that the sole purpose in 1925 of

13

the FAA was that business people who wanted to get

i4
15

together and agree to arbitrate their disputes, that that

16

would be enforceable.
QUESTION:

Why do you suppose the Congress

17

referred expressly to seamen and railroad workers if the

18

last phrase dealing with those engaged in interstate

19

commerce would have covered all of those categories?

20

f

And — and as, and as you look

MR. ALLRED:

Well, I think — I think, Your

21

Honor, that they referred to seamen and railroads because

22

those were basically the two union groups that were

23

lobbying for the exclusion, but the language went on

24

further and said — it mentioned those two groups but then

25

went further and said all classes of workers engaged in

that to transportation, is really just, was — at least in

3

retrospect it appears that that court did not have the

4

benefit of the legislative history that this Court has.

QUESTION:

And the Tenney case, which limited

Do you think your client was engaged

6

in interstate commerce the way a railroad worker or seaman

7

is engaged in interstate commerce?

MR. ALLRED:

Part of the —

Well — well, to the extent that

money is engaged in interstate commerce.

A seaman or a

10

transportation worker is not carrying goods., so to speak,

11

but money is indeed a part of interstate commerce.

12

I don't — I would not believe that that statute is to be

13

that strictly interpreted.

QUESTION:

15

16

interstate commerce.

17

MR. ALLRED:

And so

Well, I think he's effecting
I'm not sure he's engaged in

Well, I'm not — I'm not sure that

18

— if you look at the first — at the second part of the

19

statute, it didn't — it didn't really use the word

20

engage, as I recall.

21

it seems to me that what —

22

QUESTION:

23

talking about, right?

24

MR. ALLRED:

25

QUESTION:

Engage was in the second part.

And

But the first part is the part we're
Section 1?
Section 1, yes.
And that does say engaged in.

That is correct.
Seamen or railroad workers or any

other person engaged in interstate commerce.
MR. ALLRED:

Well, it seems like to me that if

5

you are working in interstate commerce, you are indeed

6

engaged in it.

least — at least that's the way it strikes me.

Perhaps that may be too simplistic, but at

QUESTION:

If —

This was enacted, of course, in when?

When was — 1925, is that when it was passed?

10

MR. ALLRED:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And the country had, or the Congress

12

had a quite different view of what interstate commerce was

13

in those days.

14

I guess we did, too.

MR. ALLRED:

That may well be.

And the truth of

15

the matter is, is that the Federal Arbitration Act hasn't

16

really come into any real prominence until just recently.

17

In fact, many of the cases that have dealt with whether —

18

with whether or not a compulsory arbitration agreement is

19

enforceable has not even addressed the Federal Arbitration

20

Act, just as the Gardner-Denver and the line of cases did.

21

QUESTION:

Gardner-Denver was a collective

22

bargaining contract, wasn't it?

23

MR. ALLRED:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

24

it seems to me that that was only the substance in which

25

the issue arose in that case, because — because there the

— what Justice Powell said in there related to Title VII

and employment discrimination.

3

a collective bargaining context I don't think is any

disparity here.

agreement that was involved in Gardner-Denver came about

6

through equal bargaining power of the negotiation between

7

the union on the one hand and management on the other to

8

reach that.

9

It seems to me that that arbitration

When Mr. Gilmer and the likes of Mr. Gilmer go

10

to work for the securities industry, there is no equal

11

bargaining power there.

MR. ALLRED:

22

I do not believe so, Your Honor.
And — or in any other of the cases

No, that — that is true.

QUESTION:

Everybody has missed it up until this

very case.
MR. ALLRED:

What was addressed in Gardner-

23

Denver was the fact that when Congress passed the Civil

24

Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, that Congress was acting to

25

correct an enormous national wrong that had gone on for

was addressed —

mentioned in a good bit of the legislative history, and

3

for whatever reason it was not picked up until 1967 when

4

the ADEA was adopted.

5

adopted, it picked up, basically as this Court has said,

6

Title VII in hoc verba, and this Court has said that when

7

you look at precedents in — for cases involving age

8

discrimination, you should look at Title VII because

9

you're dealing with the same sort of insidious

10

Age was not included in Title VII, but it was

discrimination.
We think that from the Gardner-Denver line of

12

cases that you have — that — there were two things that

13

really prompted the court to operate there, was, one, was

14

the special characteristic of employment relationship that

15

existed, that — that — and only — and Congress felt

16

that only the courts and the procedure that — or the

17

adoption of the EEOC were the way in which that you could

address that.

that mean that in 1925 he was engaged in —

MR. ALLRED:

But does

Well, now, if you looked at it from

5

a narrow standpoint that engaged meant that you had to be

6

physically engaged, you had to be driving a bus or a truck

7

or in the transportation industry, I would agree with you.

8

But I don't — but it seems like to me that if you were in

9

the New York Stock Exchange and you were selling General

10

Motors stock that emanated from Detroit, that that broker,

11

that the people in the investment banking industry were

12

engaged in interstate commerce.

just — we read the Gardner-Denver line of cases and saw

19

that this Court has held that whenever employment

discrimination is at issue, that arbitration is

21

inappropriate, and that the courts and the EEOC are the —

22

is the way to go.

QUESTION:

Mr. Allred, one thing that sort of

24

suggests that your expansive notion of engaged in

1 uses the terra engaged in interstate commerce, section 2,

2

the operative provision here, says it applies to a written

3

provision in any maritime transaction or a contract

4

evidencing a transaction involving commerce.

5

would Congress say involving commerce in section 2, and

6

say engaged in commerce in section 1, without intending a

7

distinction between the two?

MR. ALLRED:

Now, why

answer to that —

situation that says that you are going to allow

But we also

1

think that when you look at the Mitsubishi test and its

2

cases, it said that you reached the same result.

3

they say — Mitsubishi said that you will enforce the

4

Federal Arbitration agreement unless Congress has

5

manifested a contrary intent.

6

the McMahon case, said that you can look at the manifest

7

intent of Congress wherein something is inherently

8

contradictory to the act itself.

And then, I think it was

I think that was

And here Congress, in Title VII and in the age

10

act, manifested its intent that the Federal court is an

12

integral part of the — of instrument in the enforcement

13

of the laws designed to eradicate discrimination based on

14

age, race, sex, and religion.

15

irreconcilable conflict, we see, in the arbitration

16

process and the enforcement of these civil rights laws.

QUESTION:

And there is an

Mr. Allred, could I go back to the

18

question Justice Scalia asked you about reconciling —

involving — contract evidencing a transaction involving

And — maybe I'll have an answer for

At page 13 of the AFL-CIO brief the — it is

4

said, "We note at the outset that the different

5

syntactical contexts of the two references to 'commerce'

6

mean that use of precisely the same connective in the two

7

circumstances would have created a grammatical problem:

8

'transaction' could not be said to be 'engaged in'

9

commerce, nor would a reference to a 'class of workers' as

10

'involving commerce' make sense.

11

necessary inference to be drawn from the simple fact that

12

a different connective was used in the two contexts."

QUESTION:

Thus, there is no

You can have a transaction between

Don't you think?
Indeed.

I think that you could

QUESTION:

It's a very strange way to say it if

they meant the same thing.
MR. ALLRED:

But when you look at the

4

legislative history, though, of the Federal Arbitration

5

Act, it is abundantly clear that it was designed only for

6

the business entities, where, when they got together and

7

made their contracts there to buy, sell, or what have you,

they agreed to arbitrate their dispute.

QUESTION:

You mean only corporations, it

dispute over your given — your given contract, that you

Is it your contention that your

QUESTION:

I sun

Well, but that's quite different than

saying he didn't knowingly do it.
MR. ALLRED:

Well, he knew he signed a clause

7

that said under the New York Stock Exchange he would agree

8

to arbitrate his disputes, but he had no idea that it

9

would rely to any sort of civil rights that he had, when

10

Congress has passed a law, and under the age act, that

11

says he's entitled to a jury trial, that says that the

12

EEOC has all of this — all of this process there to

13

investigate, to conciliate.

14

maybe because age is so paramount, if the EEOC has not

15

acted within 60 days, then he may go ahead and elect to

16

bring suit.

And then under the age act,

Yeah.

MR. ALLRED:

I have a hard time — yeah, you can

9

as relates to the securities industry, that this — the

10

entire security industry has — if you go to work for

11

them, then you have to sign this agreement.

12

QUESTION:

That was true in the McMahon case,

13

too.

Anyone making a deal with the brokers had to sign

14

the same sort of agreement.
MR. ALLRED:

15

But the difference there, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, is that that person dealing with the broker could

17

walk away, and that was a business relationship and not an

18

employment relationship.

19

Gilmer could walk away, but if he wanted to go to work in

20

the securities industry he had no choice but to sign that

21

agreement.

MR. ALLRED:

MR. ALLRED:

I think that that's the way section

legislative history of section 1 reads.
In McDonald v. City of West Branch, a case

12

decided in 1984, just 1 year before Mitsubishi, this Court

13

said although arbitration is well suited to resolving

14

contractual disputes, it cannot provide an adequate

15

substitute for judicial proceeding in protecting the

Federal statutory and constitutional rights that section

17

1983 of the civil rights was designed to safeguard.

18

would add to that, and the other civil rights.

And in the McMahon case they said that if the —

20

if the enforcement scheme is inherently in conflict — if

the statutory right is inherently in conflict with the

I

didn't —
MR. SPEARS:

No, the Supreme Court said that the

arbitration only resolved the contractual claim under the

collective bargaining contract.

And the company

apparently was trying to take that contract resolution and

saying well, then, that controls, through preclusion, that
