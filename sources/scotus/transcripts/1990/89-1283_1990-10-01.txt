ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

(10:05 a.m.)

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioners are 15 small villages and towns in

12

Ohio that purchase electricity from the Ohio Power Company

13

for the purpose of reselling it to their residents.

14

Power is an electric utility company that sells

15

electricity at wholesale, and is part of a public utility

16

holding system called the American Electric Power Company.

17

That company is registered under the Public Utility

18

Holding Company Act, and as a consequence of that, Ohio

19

Power is subject to regulation by both the Federal Energy

20

Regulatory Commission and the Securities Exchange

21

Commission.

22

Ohio

At issue in this case is the division of

23

regulatory authority specified in section 318 of the

24

Federal Power Act between these two agencies in connection

25

with Ohio Power's wholesale electric rates.

The rates

4

production of electricity by the Ohio Power Company.

Coal represents

The issue in this case arises because Ohio Power

5
6

does not purchase its coal on the open market, but rather

7

it purchases most of its coal from a wholly owned

8

subsidiary called the Southern Ohio Coal Company.

9

1971 and 1980 Ohio Power went to the Securities Exchange

Between

10

Commission and asked for four separate orders with respect

11

to the coal mined by the.Southern Ohio Coal Company.

12

The first one provided essentially for the

13

creation of the coal mining operation and asked for

14

securities to be issued for that purpose.

followed up by an additional grant of securities in order

16

to provide an actual operating opportunity for that coal

company.

inter-affiliate coal transactions.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Phillips, what is the effect of

the SEC order?

5

6

Does it require that coal be purchased at

MR. PHILLIPS:

To the extent it applies at all,

7

it would — it would clearly be just a ceiling.

8

it seems to me clearly, what I think is in fact the case

9

is it doesn't say anything about how it has to be

But what

16

saying that we will comply with that requirement, whatever

17

it happens to be at the end of the day.
QUESTION:

What it does is recite an intention by Ohio

The way I would

Since those standards incorporate a

So you don't concede that at least

the SEC orders effectively set a ceiling?
MR. PHILLIPS:

20

No, I don't believe that they

21

necessarily -- I mean, at some point they set a ceiling in

22

the sense that you cannot exceed either cost or the market

23

price.

24

anything about what Ohio Power is required to do with

respect to the Southern Ohio Coal Company.

But I don't think they were designed to say

And it is difficult to see any requirements in

1
2

those orders, given that there is nothing that

3

specifically says anything about Ohio Power buying coal

4

from Southern Ohio, how much, at what prices.

says that Southern Ohio will sell to the American Electric

It doesn't even specify Ohio Power in

QUESTION:

8

It only

How did the court of appeals construe

the order?
MR. PHILLIPS:

10

The court of appeals was able to

11

avoid having to construe the order, because it held that

12

it made no difference whether there was a conflict between

13

the — its — the SEC regulation and FERC regulation.

14

What it said was this is a matter subject to regulation by

15

the SEC under section 13(b).

16

section 318 meant that FERC was ousted of its otherwise

17

appropriate regulatory authority.

18

construe those orders.
QUESTION:

19

And the way they construed

So they didn't have to

You don't really care whether the —

20

I mean, you wouldn't lose this case if the — if it were

21

perfectly clear that the SEC purported to set a ceiling,

22

would you?
MR. PHILLIPS:

23
24
25

No, Justice White, absolutely

not.
QUESTION:

You don't really care, then?

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that

Like the court of appeals.
Yes, but except for precisely the

4

opposite reason, which is that I don't care because it is

5

clear to me that there is no conflict between what the

6

FERC has done here and what the SEC has done here, and

7

therefore it should make no difference how the SEC's

8

orders are characterized.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

What would be the SEC's angle here?

What would be their purpose in setting a ceiling?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, they want to — they would

12

be reviewing to assess the relationships between the

13

Southern Ohio Coal Company and the Ohio Power Company in

14

order to ensure that there are no dealings going on beyond

15

whatever representations are being made in connection with

16

these orders.

17

take into account, and so they have a quite reasonable —

18

they might, potentially at least, want to exercise their

19

authority to promote those purposes.

20
21
22

I mean, they have investment regulation to

QUESTION:

Who are they protecting, or who are

they looking out for?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, they could be -- in this

23

setting they could be looking out for debt holders or

24

preferred shareholders of Ohio Power Company, or debt --

25

anybody who might have debt with the Southern Ohio Coal

QUESTION:

But I would think that they would --

aren't they supposed to look out for either the coal
company here or a subsidiary, rather than the principal?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think in general they are

6

supposed to look out for them.

7

understanding of what the SEC's authority and mandate is

8

is to make sure that the transactions among affiliates

within a public utility holding company system are — are

On the other hand, my

10

handled in a way that the public is informed as to the

11

operations, and that no one is injured, either the public

12

interest or individual companies within that system.

13

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think someone would

14

be -- would be injured if an acquisition of a company that

15

has coal reserves that is entered into for the purpose of

16

using those reserves in the -- in the operation of a

QUESTION:

I am just trying to figure out what

3

the SEC approved, though.

4

approved that agreement which said that the sale would be

5

at cost?

6

And the SEC approved --

Is that what it said?
MR. PHILLIPS:

What did it say?

No, the SEC approved four

7

separate securities transactions that don't say anything

8

about the sale of coal between Ohio Power and the Southern

9

Ohio Coal Company.

With respect to those contracts, those

10

contracts were not put before the SEC for review, and they

11

have never been approved by the SEC.

12

will allow Ohio Power to invest essentially in these coal

13

companies in order to ensure that they have available

14

supplies.

15

All it said was we

Now, in the process of saying that they did

16

indicate, the SEC indicated, that it was the intention of

17

Ohio Power to purchase -- or not even Ohio Power, the AEP

18

system, to purchase its coal, because that would guarantee

19

a reliable supply.

20

cost that would be incorporated into that arrangement.

21

QUESTION:

But it says nothing about the specific

QUESTION:

1
2

— sold coal to Ohio Power could not

exceed cost to SOCCO.

And it purports to be quoting it.

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Well, the specific language of

4

the order doesn't refer to Ohio Power.

5

American Electric System, frankly.
QUESTION:

6

It refers to the

Well, I know, but at least it said —

7

it set the price at which SOCCO could sell the coal.

8

said could not exceed cost.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

It

Yes, it does say that, Justice

10

White.

11

far as a requirement in any sense to be applied against

12

Ohio Power in the context of a FERC rate-making proceeding

13

is that that is precisely the same language that exists in

14

section 13(b), is that coal or these goods have to be sold

15

at cost.

16

enacted, the SEC has had a regulation on the books that

17

restricted the sale of coal or any other goods among

18

interaffiliate companies to the market price.

19

referencing language of cost, that doesn't necessarily say

20

anything about what is required in the relationship

21

between Ohio Power and the Southern Ohio Coal Company.

22

23

The problem with -- with making much of that as

And since the first day that that statute was

QUESTION:

So by

Even -- even where the market price

is above cost?

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

In terms of what the charges are?

Yes, sir.

Are you saying that

1

despite this commitment that -- that it would not — it

2

would not violate the arrangement that the SEC approved to

3

sell above cost, so long as it's — it's not above market

4

price?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I would have guessed that it

6

might have been a risky venture, frankly, to try that.

On

7

the other hand, rule 92 states unmistakably that you are

8

supposed to, that you have a market basis.

9

I think they could have at least gone to the SEC and said

And therefore

10

despite these recitals in the order what we really want to

11

do is to be able to sell it at market price, and be able

12

to do that.

13

and seek that kind of approval.

14
15
16

I think they are still free to go to the SEC

QUESTION:

If cost means market, I don't — I

don't even know how we can communicate anymore.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm not the one who says

17

cost means market.

18

cost means market, or at least the restriction based on

19

cost in section 13(b) is fully satisfied by a market price

20

standard within rule 92.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

The SEC has since the first day said

But that makes no sense at all in

terms of ordinary English usage.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well what does — but see, the

24

reason for that is that section 13(b) doesn't say things

25

have to follow at cost.

What section 13(b) says is you

cannot have an interaffiliate contract, period, unless you

2

satisfy certain requirements of the SEC.

3

requirements is language that says at cost economically

4

and efficiently allocated among the various parties.

5

it is not a strict at-cost standard such that Congress

6

said in 13(b) this is how you have to operate in terms of

interaffiliate contracts.

8

to the Securities Exchange Commission, and it has

9

exercised its authority in a way that in no way undermines

10
11

And one of those

So

It's a delegation of authority

what went on here.
I think it's important to step back for a

12

second, because the truth is whatever the SEC has said

13

about how Ohio Power and the Southern Ohio Coal Companies

14

should entertain the idea of selling the coal between

15

themselves, that is nevertheless fundamentally different

16

from the question of how much the Ohio Power Company can

17

charge its rate payers.

18

what the issue is in this case under section 318.

19

And that is really the essence of

The question here is is there a conflict between

20

those two provisions.

And the reason we need to get to

21

that analysis is because I think we can all agree, or

22

should all at least agree that the D.C. Circuit erred in

23

its construction of section 318, which says that simply

24

because this is a matter within the jurisdiction of the

25

SEC under section 13(b), that for that reason alone FERC

1

is ousted of its important rate-making authority over a

2

component of cost that represents essentially 50 percent

3

of the rates that get charged to the petitioners in this

4

case.

5

What the -- what we know from both the SEC and

6

the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is that they are

7

in complete agreement with the petitioners that the court

8

of appeals erred by over broadly construing the

9

restrictions on section -- in section 318.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, I take it that the

11

court below thought that the term "subject matter" could

12

be interpreted broadly, and do you think that the court

13

below made at least a reasonable construction of the

14

statute, a possible construction of the statute, so that

15

we get into a deference question?

16

interpretation a reasonable one?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is — is their

I think if you take the

18

combination of the statutory language, the structure of

19

the act, and the regulatory history under the act it is

20

not a reasonable construction of the statute, because —

21

and also it represents an incredibly malleable

22

interpretation of the term "subject matter."

23

And to a certain extent both the FERC and the

24

court of appeals, I think, and certainly Ohio Power, is

25

subject to some criticism for their handling of what the
13

1

term "subject matter" means.

2

criticized FERC for saying, well, this is rate making, and

3

therefore -- and the SEC doesn't engage in rate making and

4

therefore it must be a different subject matter.

5

that is an overbroad analysis of the question.

6

that there are certain — it is certainly possible that

7

the SEC could enter an order that might affect rate making

8

directly by a requirement that could trigger section 318.

9

k

The court of appeals

I think

On the other hand, it certainly doesn't follow

10

what Ohio Power argues here, which is to say we all agree

11

on what the subject matter here is.

12

interaffiliate coal transaction, and therefore we have

13

separate requirements regarding that.

14

It's the

The point here is that there is no obvious

15

definition of the term "subject matter."

16

to do is step back and see what is it you are trying to

17

get at under the statute by that language.

18

are trying to get at by that language is you have one

requirement imposed by one agency, another requirement

imposed by a separate agency.

is that only one requirement is then ousted.

You have given me a possible

How do you define it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't think you can

8

define subject matter in the abstract, and the SEC and

9

FERC agree with that.

They -- they frankly admit that

10

subject matter is not a term that you can simply say this

11

is what it means.

12

any situation where both -- where both agencies impose

13

irreconcilable obligations.

14

irreconcilable obligations imposed, it is clear then that

they are involved in the same subject matter by

Because when you have got

And the reason why you do it that way —

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that's — the reason it's a

narrow definition is that that is the approach that best

effectuates Congress' purpose.

22

for this to be a situation where the FERC and the SEC

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question, the statutory question before the

15

Court involves the proper reconciliation of two different

16

levels of overlap and duplication.

17

the problem of the imposition of duplicative and possibly

18

conflicting requirements on particular regulated entities.

19

But on the second level, there is the problem of the

20

extent to which the SEC is to be called upon to provide

21

the full panoply of rate regulatory functions and

22

expertise for holding company affiliates that FERC

23

otherwise provides if those functions are to be provided

24

at all in the context of holding company affiliates.

agencies before the Court today is that the court of

2

appeals has interpreted section 318 of the Federal Power

Act in a manner that goes too far in eliminating overlap

and the mere possibility of conflict on the first level.

require impractical duplication of mission by the SEC and

Mr. Wallace, the thrust of the power

Do you agree with the entire argument that was made by the

QUESTION:

You did take the position that the

power company can ignore the three orders of the SEC on

MR. WALLACE:

The orders don't speak to sales as

23

such.

They — they approve the securities transactions.

24

The orders all appear in full in the joint appendix,

25

beginning at page 76, the series of four orders.

if it was allowing cost to gravitate to market, when cost

under the SEC's order was a limitation, it recognized that

there was an obvious irreconcilability.

prescription is to constrain us to the lower of cost or

MR. BERLIN:

That is correct, Justice.
The two are inevitably intertwined.
That is correct, Justice Stevens,

province, said that while we are going to specify and

police most of the costs, we are going to delegate to the

FERC, as it is permitted to do under 318, the

2

MR. BERLIN:

If you look at the legislative

history, what the legislative history tells me is Congress

4

recognized that it was setting up two regulatory regimes,

5

sharply divide jurisdiction, that you could have a

there would be supremacy in favor of the SEC.

2

And I come to that because I honestly believe

3

from looking at the legislative history that Congress

4

recognized in 1935 that while it was imposing a regulatory

5

regime, there could well be instances where too much

6

regulation would stifle the objectives of Congress.

7

Therefore it said where the subject matter is the same and

8

the SEC has spoken, the FERC should not.

10

And indeed, if the FERC imposes

I believe that if you look at section 318,

11

Justice Scalia, you will not find any support for the

notion that it is addressing conflicts of requirements.

13

Direct conflict does not appear in the text of 318.

appears in the heading, but the heading talks about

conflicts of jurisdiction.

would be permissible.

MR. BERLIN:

for me to tell whether Ohio Power believes section 13(b)
