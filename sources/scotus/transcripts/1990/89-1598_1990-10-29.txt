ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN MICHAEL MURRAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MURRAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from an accident as defined by

10

the Warsaw Convention that occurred aboard Eastern

11

Airlines flight number 855 while in route from Miami to

12

Nassau in the Bahamas.

13

the flight crew noticed a low oil pressure indication on

14

one of the Lockheed 1011's three engines.

15

that engine and began a return to Miami.

16

other two engines of the aircraft quit because of oil

17

starvation.

18

restarted the engine originally shut down and was able to

19

effect a safe landing at the Miami International Airport.

20

As flight 855 approached Nassau,

They shut down
In route the

After a period of unpowered flight, the crew

None of the passengers in these cases suffered

21

any physical injury.

22

warnings to the passengers including ditching

23

instructions, safety instructions, and ultimately a notice

24

that ditching is imminent, it's undisputed that some of

25

these passengers suffered fright.

Because the crew issued appropriate

Eastern received a judgment on the pleadings.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

MR. MURRAY:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MURRAY:

Not all of them?

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
Not all of the passengers?
Well, there were 162 people on

7

board and there are 25 plaintiffs in this case, so I guess

8

you can draw your own conclusions from -- from that.

9

Eastern, after having received judgment on the

10

pleadings, was -- the Eleventh Circuit reversed that and

11

held that emotional injury was in fact compensable under

12

Warsaw, and that's the primary issue about which we're

13

here today.

14

Because of the tenor of the respondents' brief,

15

I think it's important that I note one thing specifically

16

here, and that is that the fault or culpability of Eastern

17

Airlines in this matter is not at issue in this case.

18

the reason it's not is because Eastern's liability is

19

governed by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention.

And

Specifically article 17 of the Convention

20
21

provides that the carrier shall be liable.

It's an

22

absolute liability provision when merged with the Montreal

23

Agreement.

24

sustained in the event of death, wounding, or bodily

25

injury.

The carrier shall be liable for damages

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Murray, if a -- if a passenger in

2

an accident covered by the Warsaw Convention did suffer

3

some physical injury such as a cut on the leg in the

4

course of whatever happened in the air, but also says that

5

there were emotional injuries suffered as well, can the

6

damages cover both the injury to the leg and the emotional

7

trauma?

8
9

MR. MURRAY:
that they can.

Our position is, Justice O'Connor,

We think that there is a requirement that

10

there be a manifest, palpable, physical injury, and the

11

damages suffered in any form after that are recoverable.

12

QUESTION:

Well, is that because those emotional

3

injuries are incorporated under the term "lesion

4

corporelle" as a matter of law in France?

5

MR. MURRAY:

No, it's not.

As a matter of fact

6

we feel that the term "lesion corporelle" -- I hesitate to

7

use it as a term of law in France, but it is a French term

8

that it uniquely indicative of trauma or lesion to or

9

infringement of the body or an organ of the body.

QUESTION:

injury in the case I posed is recoverable?

22

MR. MURRAY:

QUESTION:

Why do you say that the emotional

I think —
Under what language of the Warsaw

Convention is it covered?

But you take the position that the

14

term "lesion corporelle" requires as a condition precedent

15

some physical injury to the body?

16

MR. MURRAY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And we

17

believe that that "lesion corporelle," the occurrence of a

18

physical injury, is a condition preceded to recovering

19

whatever damages a passenger suffers.

20

QUESTION:

And the emotional injury can be

21

compensable even though it results from causes unrelated

22

to the cut?

23

MR. MURRAY:

I believe that is a fair result,

24

Your Honor.

some sort is, as the briefs have pointed out, is to sort

2

the meritorious from the unmeritorious claims.

3

that was an intent of the Convention.

4

QUESTION:

I think

You, you rely on the language I

5

presume, which does, does not say damages caused by death,

6

wounding, or other bodily injury, but damage sustained in

7

8

that text, nor in the French which says "en cas de mort,"

9

in the event of death.

10

There is no causal connection required in

Not, not as we -- I'm helping --

I'm trying to help you here.

11

MR. MURRAY:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, I —

I understand, Your Honor.

I think

14

that that is a literal, correct interpretation of the

15

French and the English translation of article 17, and I

16

think that that is the -- frankly was the intent of the

17

framers of the Convention to, to do exactly what they did

18

there.

19

As, as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, it --

20

the damage which is unqualified, the word damage, dommage,

21

is unqualified, and it arises only in the event of the

22

occurrence of death -- "mort," wounding -- "blessure," or

23

bodily injury,

24
25

"lesion corporelle."

QUESTION:

The problem I have, Mr. Murray, is

that I cannot imagine a bodily injury that is not a

1

wounding -- I mean, wounding is a very -- I'm not sure

2

that's a good -- "a lesion corporelle" that is not a

3

"blessure."

4

Can you tell me an example of --

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, Your Honor, the, the research

5

that we've done into the French meaning of these terms

6

indicates that a "blessure" indicates a trauma of such

7

force that it is in fact a wounding and the example that

8

the text used is if there's a simply compound fracture of

9

a bone and there is no breaking of the skin, then that is

10

not a "blessure."

11

"lesion corporelle," a infringement of the body or its

12

organs.

13

between the two terms, and that's the reason that they

14

were I believe used, the three in the alternative.

15
16

On the other hand, it would deemed a

So there are differences in the French meaning

QUESTION:

Very, very elegant, but I'm not --

I'm not sure it's right.

17

(Laughter.)

18

QUESTION:

Did — neither brief, although

19

correct me if I'm wrong, makes any point out of the phrase

20

"de tout autre," of any other -- does that just not help

21

either party?

22

MR. MURRAY:

23

QUESTION:

Justice Kennedy -Because it, it seems to me that "any

24

other" might relate "lesion corporelle" to wounding or

25

death.

1

MR. MURRAY:

Justice Kennedy, it appears that --

2

and our analysis is that "mort" and "blessure" are not

3

totally inclusive, as I just explained, of any bodily

4

injury, any trauma, any impact, any infringement on the

5

body, and the terms "de tout autre," "lesion corporelle"

6

were included to expand.

7

QUESTION:

I'm just referring to the words "de

8

tout autre."

9

weak without those words?

10
11
12

13

Would your case be just as strong or just as

MR. MURRAY:

I believe that, that other words

could be used to include -QUESTION:

Well, it could have eliminated those.

It just could have said "au lesion corporelle."

14

MR. MURRAY:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MURRAY:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, I think they could have.
So that has no effect on your case?
No, not -- not to my understanding.
Well, it may harm your case a little

18

bit, because if you -- as you've just described the

19

difference between "blessure" and "lesion corporelle,"

20

"lesion corporelle" is not another -- I mean a "blessure"

21

is one kind of "lesion corporelle," I assume.

22

MR. MURRAY:

23

QUESTION:

24

they're two different things.

25

MR. MURRAY:

That's correct.

All right --

You've told me -- you've told me that

I'm not saying that they're two

1

different things.

I'm saying that a "blessure" would be

2

included within the broad term of "lesion corporelle," but

3

not necessarily vice versa.

4

that is not necessary a wounding.

You can have a bodily injury

5

QUESTION:

I see.

I see.

6

QUESTION:

So the addition of "tout autre lesion

7

corporelle" broadens the liability of the carrier over

8

what it would be with just "cas de mort, de blessure"?

9
10

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

the way we read and understand the phrase.
The French and the English translation of

11
12

article 17 we believe as we have just now discussed are

13

quite clear and that the damage recoverable is recoverable

14

in the event of the death, wounding, or bodily injury.

15

And we feel that the wording of article 17 is quite clear,

16

that it's not necessary to go any further than that.

17

looking at the drafters' intent in the 1929 Convention, it

18

is clear that there was vast silence on the issue of what

19

article 17 was meant to include.

20

But

The subsequent drafting history, as review by

21

the Eleventh Circuit, is somewhat more helpful in

22

determining what the drafters of the original Convention

23

meant.

4

That was rejected in the 1951 Madrid

Similarly, in 1955 at The Hague, the Greek

delegate asked for a change to broaden the terms of

article 17 and that was sounded defeated.

QUESTION:

country --

10

MR. MURRAY:

11

QUESTION:

12

Correct.
-- would the meaning change under the

Convention?
MR. MURRAY:

Justice O'Connor, we don't feel

14

that the -- number one, the original French translation of

article 17, the original French version rather of article

present time.

19

We don't feel that they have any significance at all with

20

respect to the Guatemala City protocol and, as was pointed

21

out in Saks, the Guatemala City protocol, not having been

22

ratified by the Senate, does not thereby govern this case.

23

There have been changes that deal with

The line of demarcation that we're asking to --

24

the Court to impose in the interpretation of the

25

Convention is we believe one that is extremely fair.

The

1

respondents have raised in their brief the concern that

2

people would in fact be injured, be frightened, be

3

entitled to recover damages in these cases and not be able

4

to effect that recovery.

5

requirement we feel is consistent with policies that are

6

in place in this country today.

of demarcation would allow claims that are real, that are

reasoning.

MR. MURRAY:

Unquestionably, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

there will be.

determination made as to where a fair and equitable

18

demarcation line is, and I believe that the physical,

19

palpable, objective-type manifestation of any injury meets

QUESTION:

Mr. Murray, they, they argue in

22

response that the requirement of an accident imposes some

23

kind of a limit on the danger that every time you get in a

24

rainstorm, you have a lot of claims.

the force of that argument?

MR. MURRAY:

Justice Stevens, I think that that

2

is a concern that Eastern has and that other carriers have

3

in this -- in this issue.

4

one, under the Warsaw scheme, if there is an accident, the

5

carrier is absolutely liable because the Montreal

6

Agreement has waived any ability of the carrier to raise

7

the due care defense.

8

experienced an accident during travel on the aircraft or

9

during in any of the processes of embarkation or

It's very clear that, number

Number two, if a passenger having

10

disembarkation, presents a compensable injury, he's

11

automatically entitled to recover.

12

Accident has been held to be a very broad,

13

broadly defined term.

14

anything that is uninspected or unintended from the

15

standpoint of the carrier.

16

unexpected, for example, is an accident.

17

QUESTION:

It's very inclusive.

It includes

A turbulence encounter that is

I thought so and although the

18

respondents' brief in this case suggests that a turbulence

19

encounter is not an accident as I recall it.

20

MR. MURRAY:

Justice Scalia, there are a number

21

of cases that we have dealt with that have -- we've

22

treated as accidents and there certainly are cases that

23

hold that a turbulence encounter, an unexpected turbulence

24

encounter, is an accident, as would be, for example, a

25

four-engine aircraft that has a problem with one engine

and a precautionary shutdown is made.

announced to the passenger, that is unexpected from the

3

standpoint of the carrier.

4

Warsaw and it would be compensable.

5

scenario, any passenger could then present an absolute

6

liability claim to the carrier saying, by the way, when

7

you shut the engine down and you told us about it, it sure

8

scared me.

QUESTION:

And if that is

That is an accident under

Of course the absolute liability came

into effect with the Montreal Treaty --

irrelevant.

showing of fault.

We're interpreting the Warsaw Convention as

MR. MURRAY:

That's -- well, that's correct,

17

Your Honor.

The Montreal Agreement is in fact the

18

agreement that is in place now.

19

provisions were intended under the original 1929

20

Convention and what was added in addition to the strict

21

liability provisions was a provision where the carrier

22

could show that it should be exonerated of liability if it

23

used all due care and that simply has been waived with

24

respect to the Montreal Agreement.

after a compensable accident gives rise to absolute

2

liability.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but the point still is that as

4

of the time of the Warsaw Convention you were subject to

5

strict liability.

MR. MURRAY:

That's correct.

That's correct.

7

-- let me retreat from that and say that the carrier was

8

liable strictly to a passenger, but it was able to avail

9

itself of the due care defense.

I

I think it was stronger

10

-- it was intended to be stronger by the drafters of the

11

Convention than recourse to the national law at that time.

in the French wording of article 17 where it talks about

MR. MURRAY:

I'm not saying we didn't find any

use of the term "lesion corporelle," but I think that the

10

readings that we did and the things that we cited in our

brief and with which there's very -- generally no

12

disagreement is the fact that the term "lesion corporelle"

13

is translated appropriately to be bodily injury.

the phrase "lesion corporelle" is not appropriately

15

translated into the terms, the English phrase "bodily

proposed and the court of appeals held was that the phrase

Work -- the courts in workmen's

accident as having any significant limitation.
MR. EATON:

Well, the court took a stab at that

12

in the Air France v. Saks case and did define it to

13

exclude things that happened internally to the passenger.

14

But the definition of accident that the court came up with

15

in Air France v. Saks is very broad.

18

But let me get back to the French legal meaning,
because that's the technical guestion before the Court.
The conclusion of Dr. Mankiewicz and a number of

19

other scholars which are not cited in my brief but are

20

collected in the Eleventh Circuit's opinion and the

QUESTION:

Did the theory of Dr. Mankiewicz

being that the drafters had intended to come up with

6

something that was recognized in French law?

7

MR. EATON:

No, his conclusion was that by using

8

a phrase "lesion corporelle," they meant something broader

9

than the narrower concepts recognized,

"dommage personal,"

10

"dommage patrimoniel," "materiel," or "moral," that they

11

wanted something broader and what they were after was --

QUESTION:

13

MR. EATON:

Broader than any of those?
No.

Broad as the English concept of

personal injury, which incidentally is the word that all

15

the subsequent revisions of the Warsaw Convention have

16

used, which is down there at the bottom of my list of

17

reasons for the Eleventh Circuit's construction.

18

Dr. Mankiewicz was also impressed by the fact

19

that the German delegate to the Convention went back and

20

translated the official German translation of the Warsaw

21

Convention, rendered the phrase "lesion corporelle” as

22

"any infringement on the health of a passenger," and the

23

German translation is now used in Germany, Austria, and

Switzerland -- much broader than the English bodily

Mr. Eaton, before you leave the --

you know, this textual stuff to an extent, Dr. Mankiewicz,

12

did he say anything more categoric, because I didn't go

opinion below is his statement that while bodily injury is

15

undoubtedly a grammatically correct translation of "lesion

may rightly be argued that the meaning of that expression

in French law and its equivalence in other civil laws are

more correctly rendered by the expression personal injury.

There is no question but that the

But, no, what he says is that it is ambiguous,

But let's turn to the subsequent conduct.

I'm paraphrasing it.
Mr.

4

Murray talks about a 1951 meeting in Madrid at which

5

absolutely nothing happened, nothing came out of it.

6

was an interim meeting at which some people proposed

7

probably to cure the ambiguity that mental injury be made

more specific in article 17, but nothing happened.

of the amendments adopted at The Hague.

And it translated the phrase,

MR. EATON:

What, what does 31(c) deal with?

17

to be put on the passenger ticket, and it says you've got

18

to tell the passenger about the limitations on his right

19

of action to recover for death or personal injury.

20

Now in 1966 in Montreal, after the Untied States

21

Government denounced this treaty because it had a $8,300

22

cap on the recoverability of damages, the airlines got

23

together and they decided to raise their limits, accept

24

strict liability, which was not initially written into the

25

Warsaw Convention.

It was a negligence action although

the burden of proof was shifted to the carrier to prove

2

non-negligence rather than the traditional.

3

exchange for all of those, the airlines also agreed to put

4

on the face of their ticket an advice to the passenger

5

which advised them of their limitations of liability.

6

And in

In all the discussions and the written documents

produced at the Montreal Agreement, the phrase bodily

injury and personal injury are used interchangeably

without distinguishing between the two.

point I'm trying to make is that the English translation

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MURRAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to point very briefly to two things

13

that Mr. Eaton said.

14

which the Eleventh Circuit fell in discussing the French

15

meaning of the term "lesion corporelle."

QUESTION:

Mr. Eaton fell into the trap in

He didn't fall into it.

He jumped in

and invited the Eleventh Circuit to follow him, I think.

(Laughter.)

MR. MURRAY:

20

But he skipped from a determination -- a

21

discussion of "lesion corporelle" immediately to a

22

discussion of "dommage," "dommage personal," "dommage

patrimoniel."

"dommage moral."
