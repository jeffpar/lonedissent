ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. McDUFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a case about the enforcement of section

5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

12

preclearance section of the act and was designed to apply

13

to specific jurisdictions, including the State of

14

Louisiana.

16

right to vote solely on account of skin color.

17

Section 5 is the

In order to prevent this discrimination in the

18

future, Congress exercised its authority under the

19

Fifteenth Amendment and provided in section 5 that a

20

covered jurisdiction may not implement a voting change

21

unless and until it demonstrates to a Federal authority,

22

the Attorney General or the Federal District Court for the

23

District of Columbia, that the change is not

discriminatory.

By doing so, Congress shifted what this

from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims.

This is a case about voting changes for

elections for State court judges.

changes for elections for State court judges, just as it

covers voting changes for elections of other public

officials.

court decisions to that effect, the most recent being this

past fall in the case from Georgia, and the appellees make

no contention that judicial elections are excluded from

Section 5 covers voting

This Court twice has summarily affirmed lower

section 5's coverage.
This appeal raises three issues.

11

First, can

12

voting changes involving the creation of judgeships that

13

have not been submitted for evaluation under section 5

14

nevertheless be retroactively cleared solely because of

15

the submission and preclearance of later voting changes

16

involving subsequent judgeships in the same election

17

district?

18

Second, did the three-judge district court err

19

in permitting elections for State court judges pursuant to

20

uncleared voting changes to which the Attorney General

21

objected under section 5 because of his concern about the

22

possibility of racial discrimination?

23

Third, in the event the district court did err

24

in permitting the elections to go forward, what relief

25

should be ordered by this Court at the present juncture?

These issues arrive, arise in the following

2

factual context.

3

the legislature enacted a number of voting changes with

4

respect to judicial elections, most of them involving the

5

creation of judgeships to be elected at large in majority

6

white, multi-member districts.

7

State officials implemented many of those voting changes

8

and held elections for many of the judges without seeking

9

preclearance.

In Louisiana during the past 25 years

In violation of section 5

At the same time State officials did submit and

10
11

obtained preclearance for some of the judgeships.

12

result in some judicial districts there were combinations

13

of cleared and uncleared judgeships within the same

14

district.

15

As a

Only in response to this litigation in 1987 did

16

State officials go back and submit all of the prior

17

uncleared voting changes involving the creation of

18

judgeships to the Attorney General for preclearance.

19

Beginning on September 23, 1988, the Attorney General

20

interposed objections to some of the voting changes

21

involving the creation of judgeships in certain specific

22

judicial election districts in the State of Louisiana.

23

State officials did not then take any action to seek

24

preclearance in Federal District Court in the District of

25

Columbia.

MR. McDUFF:

the State took no action to seek preclearance in Federal

District Court in the District of Columbia.

That's correct.
I mean, he had always approved them?
That's correct.

Instead the

10

judgeships to which the Attorney General objected.

11

plaintiffs filed a motion for an injunction to stop the

12

elections and the district court denied the injunction for

13

the most part.

14

The

The district — with respect to some of the

15

judgeships the district court held that the preclearance

16

of later voting changes involving subsequent judgeships in

17

the particular judicial districts retroactively cleared

18

all the prior previously unsubmitted judgeships.

19

respect to other judgeships that the district court

20

conceded were uncleared, the district court nevertheless

21

permitted the elections to go forward and permitted the

22

winners to hold office for as long as it takes the State

23

to initiate and litigate in Federal District Court in the

24

District of Columbia a section 5 preclearance action.

injunction pending appeal against some of the elections

2

the district court had permitted to go forward.

3

on January 19, 1991, of this year, 2-1/2 years after the

4

Attorney General initially interposed his objections, the

5

State of Louisiana filed a section 5 declaratory judgment

6

action in Federal District Court in the District of

7

Columbia.
First I would like to discuss the issue of

9

Finally

retroactive clearance.

Section 5 places upon the covered

10

jurisdictions the burden of notifying the Federal, the

11

Federal District Court for the District of Columbia or the

12

Attorney General of voting changes.

13

circumvention of the act, this Court has made it clear in

14

cases like McCain v. Lybrand and United States v. Board of

15

Commissioners of Sheffield, Alabama, that section 5

16

submissions must identify exactly the changes that are

17

being submitted to the Attorney General for review, and

18

the Attorney General can never be deemed to have

19

precleared those changes that are not submitted for

20

review.

process by preventing disguised preclearance and by

22

ensuring that the Attorney General does not unwittingly

23

preclear something that there was no opportunity to

examine.

1

different question?

2

whether the later clearance automatically preclears

3

everything that preceded it, should we at least in cases

4

where the issue is the number of office holders to be

5

chosen, simple numerical issue, should we instead ask

6

whether the later preclearance moots the fact or the issue

7

that might be raised about the prior clearance?

8

9

Instead of asking the question

You said, I think, in your brief that there
might, for example, always be, or there is always a

10

potential issue of intent.

11

sake of argument that there was an improper intent the

12

last time the number was expanded.

13

which were not precleared, and we get to the final

14

expansion, the number is increased again but there is no

15

improper intent.

16

to have whatever the later number was, and it doesn't

17

matter whether it had been done in two steps or three

18

steps.

19

is no improper intent to that, doesn't that moot the issue

20

of the prior failures?

21

Well, let's assume for the

When we get to the --

The fact is at that point the intent is

The result is going to be the same, and if there

MR. MeDUFF:

Not at all, because the Attorney

22

General had no opportunity to examine the discriminatory

23

intent that was involved in the creation of — or the

24

expansion of the at large system to whatever number you

25

had prior to the most recent change.

QUESTION:

No, I realize that.

But if you had

2

gone from let's say the original number to the final

3

number without any intermediate steps, and you get to the

4

point at which the final request for whatever the last

5

number is has no improper intent to it, why doesn't that

6

moot out the intent with respect to the intermediate step?

7

It doesn't imply that he is automatically preclearing it.

8

It's just saying it is no longer of relevance to us

9

because maybe there was an intent, an improper intent, to

10

increase the number to five, but we're now concerned with

11

the intent to have a number of seven, let's say.

12

there is no improper intent with respect to seven.

13

MR. McDUFF:

And

Because the expansion of the at

14

large system to that level had been motivated by

15

discriminatory intent, and that's exactly what the

16

Attorney General is empowered to stop under section 5.

17

mean, certainly — look at it this way.

18

of the Attorney General being submitted the change from

19

five to seven he was submitted the change from five to

20

seven and then also was told, by the way, we never

21

precleared the change from two to five.

22

submit that to you.

23

all of the evidence in front of him, and he looks at the

24

prior evidence of discriminatory intent and says it is

25

clear to me this was improper and I am going to interpose

Suppose instead

We also want to

an objection.

That is perfectly --

QUESTION:

2

Well, what does he do as a practical

3

matter?

Let's assume he says I agree with you, I think

4

seven is the appropriate number.

5

there is no unconstitutional or unstatutory intent here.

6

And yet because you failed to preclear the intermediate

7

step when you went from three to five -- what's he going

8

to do, say I will only increase the number to five now?
MR. MeDUFF:

9

I agree with you that

No, I would think the Attorney

10

General would then — I mean, obviously he could do what

11

he wanted to, but I think he would object to both changes.

12

I mean, because the system had been expanded —
QUESTION:

13

But he would at the same time be

14

saying I agree with you, seven is the appropriate number,

15

but because you failed in the past we will freeze it at

16

three?

17

What does he do?
MR. McDUFF:

No, Justice Souter, I don't think

18

it's a matter of what's the appropriate number.

It's a

19

matter of whether the at-large election method was

20

incorporated and expanded for discriminatory reasons.

21

if it was expanded from two to five for discriminatory

22

reasons, that expansion is invalid, and the Attorney

23

General is not only entitled to but has the duty to object

24

to that.

25

number of seven might be appropriate makes no difference

And

Now the fact that without such evidence the

in the situation that is discussed in your hypothetical.

supposed to do at that point?

He's supposed to object.
Well, he objects, and what should the

That the process is forever frozen at

That's not what you're arguing for.
MR. McDUFF:

8

Well, but just tell me what he's

Oh, no.

The State can then expand

its judicial work force, it can expand the number of

10

judges in that district through some election method that

11

complies with the Voting Rights Act and through which it

12

can obtain preclearance.
QUESTION:

13

Well why doesn't it comply with the

14

Voting Right Act if they want to expand it to seven and

15

there is no discriminatory intent?

16

MR. McDUFF:

Because there was a discrimination

17

in the intermediate expansion to the level of five.

I

18

mean, you can't divorce the change from five to seven from

19

the change to two to five.
Here State officials never submitted these prior

20
21

changes until the instigation of this litigation in 1987.

22

Only when the appellants sought to enjoin the fall 1990

23

elections did the State defendants claim for the first

24

time that the prior changes already had been retroactively

25

cleared.

And the district court accepted their arguments

and invalidated the Attorney General's objection on the

2

premise that the preclearance of an amendment to a State

3

statute necessarily preclears the entire statute and all

4

prior amendments to the statute.

5

Now that is directly contrary to this Court's

6

opinion 7 years ago in McCain v. Lybrand.

7

said in unmistakable terms that the submission of a voting

8

change such as an increase in the number of seats in a

9

particular election district covers only the precise

There the Court

change identified in the submission.

considered a retroactive submission of prior voting

changes or prior amendments to a State statute in that

election district.

15

prior change was never submitted, never evaluated, and

never precleared.

McCain also said that deference should

But McCain did not involve the kind

18

of change that you and Justice Souter have been talking

19

about, just adding another number where a prior number

would be included within the later number.

They were quite different items.

MR. MeDUFF:

That's right, but McCain did not

6

rest either on the dissimilarity of the two changes or any

7

sort of — the dramatic nature of the prior change.

8

9

QUESTION:

Yeah, but it's quite reasonable to

say that a change in number does not approve a prior

10

change in form.

11

say seven is okay, presumably four is okay.

But it is reasonable to say that if you

discrimination, whether intent or effect, involving --

15

involved in the expansion of the at large system.

16

the hypothetical Justice Souter and I were discussing

17

demonstrates, it's important for the Attorney General, and

18

section 5 requires, I think, for the Attorney General to

19

be entitled to examine the evidence behind each

20

independent voting change and each independent expansion

21

of the particular election method in that district.

22

QUESTION:

It's the level of

But what difference does it make if

MR. McDUFF:

1

Because you have an election system

2

in that district, and a judicial structure in that

3

district, whose expansion was motivated by discriminatory

4

intent.

5

General, under the district court's holding, has no

6

opportunity to examine the discriminatory intent involved

7

in the intermediate changes.

And I think this is the key point.

8

QUESTION:

9

that there are two questions?

10

The Attorney

Are you saying in this hypothetical
One is the ultimate number.

The other is the mechanism for electing that number.

11

MR. McDUFF:

12

QUESTION:

Exactly.
And it's the second that you're

13

concerned with, and it's the second that you find is a

14

taint that will not go away?

15
16
17

MR. McDUFF:
General's concern.

Exactly.

And that's the Attorney

And I think --

QUESTION:

That still leaves you with the

18

question of what you're going to do when the State comes

19

back and says okay, you say number four was no good, I

20

still want seven.

21

to seven, increase me from four to seven.

22

So instead of increasing me from five

MR. McDUFF:

What happens?

Well, the Attorney General objects

23

to the voting changes because he has found discrimination,

24

and then the State has to go back and if it wants to

25

expand the number of judgeships in that particular

1

election district it has to do it in a way that satisfies

2

the Attorney General or the Federal District Court of the

3

District of Columbia that section 5 is complied with.

4

QUESTION:

So once it has made the mistake in

5

going from three to four and not getting preclearance, it

6

can never, it can never correct that?

7

MR. McDUFF:

Well, it can go back and submit the

8

change from three to four to the Attorney General or to

9

the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia,

10

and obtain preclearance, if preclearance is deemed

11

appropriate.

12

QUESTION:

Well, is that precisely — if you go

13

from four to six, say, and that's a bad change, and that's

14

not submitted, and then you go from six to seven and he

15

approves six to seven.

16

seven, he approves a change from six to seven, thinking

17

that doesn't have an effect.

18

there is an unapproved prior change he wipes out the whole

19

thing, but they then could resubmit a four to seven

20

change, which would then be appraised on its own merits.

21

MR. McDUFF:

22

QUESTION:

He doesn't approve a number of

And if he then finds out

Certainly.

Certainly.

Could I ask you, what if we decide

23

that the election was — permissibly went ahead, and that

24

we say that the district — the court of appeals or the

25

district court did not need to enjoin the election.

Do we

1
2

have to decide the issue you have just been —
MR. McDUFF:

Yes, you do, Your Honor, because

3

the district court held that all of these prior judgeships

4

did not even need to be precleared, they had already been

5

precleared, and therefore the district court has said

6

those judges can remain in office.

7

held, the judges can remain in office throughout their

full terms.

The elections were

With respect to other judges that the district

10

court said, or judgeships the district court said were

11

uncleared, the district court put them on the schedule by

12

which they will only stay in office pending the litigation

13

of the D.C. case, and will have to go out of office if the

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

2

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE APPELLANTS

3
4

MR. FELDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

I'd like to first address for a moment Justice

6

White's question.

In the action going on, the declaratory

7

judgment action in the District of Columbia, not all of

8

the judgeships that are currently before this Court are at

9

issue.

Since the district court -- since the District

10

Court in this case held that some of them had already been

11

precleared, the State did not ask for a declaratory

12

judgment that those should, that those had no

13

discriminatory purpose or effect in the Washington action,

14

and therefore those seats would — something has to be

15

done with those seats regardless of what happens in the

16

declaratory judgment action.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

How many judges are involved in that

group?
MR. FELDMAN:

I can't tell you the exact number.

20

The number 18 is what is in my mind, but I am not sure

21

that's right.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And if we say that those judges have

never been precleared, suppose we accept your argument -I take you are going to argue that?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

1
2

What do we do then about those

judges?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

If they should have been

4

precleared, it's our submission that because they should

5

have been precleared and weren't, it will be up to the --

6

the case would go back to the district court and it would

7

be up to the district court to make a remedial

8

determination of what the best course of action in this

9

case is.

It may depend on a number of different factors.
Now some, when I said — whatever the number is,

10
11

it involves I think some vacancies, for instance.

12

insofar as it involves vacancies, I think we would suggest

13

that if the seats have never been filled, for instance if

14

they are newly created seats, the district court may

15

reasonably say the State doesn't really need those seats.

16

QUESTION:

I suppose the State would just amend

17

its petition in the court here in the District of

18

Columbia.

19

Well,

MR. FELDMAN:

The State could do that, but they

20

haven't because the district court's judgment in this case

21

was that those seats had already been precleared.

22

QUESTION:

Now what about the -- what about

23

those judicial seats that now have incumbents that are

24

among this group?

No.

the case that the State of Louisiana will be able to make

the showing, actually we mentioned in our brief we thought

19

they would be able to, that they need some of these

20

judgeships in operation in order for their courts to

21

operate.

22

And it will certainly be -- it will probably be

23

the case that the State will be able to show that.

25

reasonably can take that into account and can perhaps even

And in

permit the judges to stay in office until the declaratory

2

judgment action has been completed.
Again, there may be other cases where it's a

3
4

newly created judgeship where the State can't make a

5

showing that it needs that position filled, and in those

6

cases I think the district court would be best off to

7

enjoin the State from filling those positions.
QUESTION:

8

9

Enjoin them what?

Tell the judges

that -- hold a new election, or what?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

No.

I would say with respect to

11

seats, for instance, that have never been filled, the

12

district court would reasonably say the State cannot hold

13

an election to fill those seats unless and until it's

14

precleared.

15

QUESTION:

And if there are some that have been

16

filled in this interim time, but weren't precleared, what

17

about the actions taken by those people in the meantime?

Well, it's our view that whatever

judges in these seats are valid.

civil law State is that it doesn't recognize the de facto

MR. FELDMAN:

not inconsistent with the Voting Rights Act to give de

That's right.

And it's not even

12

inconsistent at the remedy stage to permit the -- for the

13

district court to make the remedial determination in its

14

discretion that the judges should stay in office and

the case with some of the seats here, then the district

court should grant an injunction at that stage.

4

QUESTION:

Are there ever reasons for a district

court not to enjoin an election if the office has not been

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, if you're assuming --

12

QUESTION:

Well, now, that was one -- equitable

considerations, I take it, pertain?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, the only one I can think of

13

is where -- and one of the cases, I don't remember which

14

one, that this Court decided, the plaintiffs came in I

15

think 2 days or 3 days before the election.

expected to be familiar with the situation and to enjoin

QUESTION:

All right.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

But once the district court has

come to the determination that there is a violation of the

Voting Rights Act, then I think -- of section 5, that the

1
2

injunction is the appropriate remedy.
QUESTION:

And all of the reasons the district

3

court gave, I think there were some five or six, were just

4

improper as a matter of law?

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think so.

I think they all -- I

6

would say yes.

The kinds of reasons they gave, that was

7

the convenience of a particular date as the best time to

8

have an election because it's likely to have most

9

participation, well, for example, as to that factor these

10

elections shouldn't have been held at all if the seats

11

weren't precleared.

12

right date to hold it doesn't seem to us to be important.

13

And the question of what date is the

Another factor in this case the district court

14

considered was the reliance interest of the candidates.

15

But if you look at the history of these elections, they

16

had been enjoined almost, they had been enjoined for a

17

long, for quite a while under the section 2 case.

18

it's very hard to see how there would have been little --

19

there would have been much of any reliance interest.

20

And

Moreover, in the original order that the

21

district court handed down concerning these elections, it

22

said that the people would only be -- that the winning

23

judges would only take office provisionally.

24

it didn't even say they would be instated in office.

25

just permitted the elections.

And so in those

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And in fact
It

1

circumstances, too, I think the reliance interest of the

2

candidates would be weak.

3

And finally, as the Court pointed out in Hampton

4

County, where there has been a violation of the Voting

5

Rights Act, in fact the uncertainty about the elections

6

could well cut directly the other way, which is it could

7

keep people from qualifying, from entering qualifications

8

for running for office, and doing other things that — and

9

it might therefore be most preferable to hold the

10

elections — it would be preferable not to hold the

11

election until the seats have been precleared and it is

12

clear that a legal -- a legally valid election is going to

13

go forward.

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, why does the Attorney

General take the position that it's only the earlier

approval that is invalid?

are nugatory too, aren't they, if the earlier one was -- I

after that?

to five and you can go from five to six.

like that and the rest hangs up there?

I think it defies

gravity in that sense.

7

the addition of another seat, he is approving that, only

8

that change in voting procedure, and that change is the

9

addition of one seat to the district.

When the Attorney General approves

Once he has

10

approved the addition of that seat, the State may hold the

11

election and may give it effect.
QUESTION:

12

13
14

Doesn't he know then how many judges

there are?
MR. FELDMAN:

He does know how many there are.

15

But if you look at the regulations, for instance, they

16

specifically provide that a State when it makes its

17

submissions must identify that all of its prior judgeships

18

have been precleared and that -- and therefore he can

19

reasonably assume that the prior ones already have been

20

precleared when he makes a decision just that the addition

21

of that one would not violate the Voting Rights Act.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case there is no question that Louisiana

4

added additional judges because Louisiana needed

5

additional judges for caseload management, just as every

6

other State in the Union and just as the Federal system

7

needs judges from time to time for caseload management.

8

In addition in this case there is no question that

9

Louisiana had no discriminatory intent in adding judges.

10

Never been any claim that any of these judges were added

11

to these districts because Louisiana intended to

12

discriminate against anybody.

13

Further in this case, there is no question that

14

the Justice Department 81 times precleared additional

15

judgeships up through 1988.

requested an additional judgeship it was granted.

MR. PUGH:

Yes, sir.

There were times when we

22

in those cases we didn't, and later in most of them there

MR. PUGH:

The 1987 regulations provide for

that, Your Honor.

16

So what the three-judge court held on these situations is

17

that when the Attorney General cleared a statute creating

18

an ultimate number of judicial seats in a particular

19

district, that preclearance constituted approval of all

20

the seats necessary to reach the ultimate number of

judicial positions in that district.

approval of the earlier ones.

11

the way to look at it, as you pointed out, Justice Scalia.

12

Otherwise, to take my example of Caddo Parish, we might be

13

left with five judges rather than nine, and maybe not even

14

that, because once the Attorney General has precleared

15

having nine judges, but not the sixth judge, by their

theory, if we go back to four judges is that a change?

for this Court to overrule it would have to hold as

clearly erroneous, that the nature of the Louisiana system

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. PUGH:

-- after this action was brought, we

6

asked him for preclearance and it wasn't granted.

And

7

then the three-judge court deemed that these judges were

8

precleared, so we haven't asked that the D.C. court

9

preclear them because the three-judge court has precleared

10

them, and that question is before this Court.

Obviously

11

if this Court holds that the three-judge court erred and

12

those aren't precleared, I am sure the next day there will

13

be an amendment filed.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. PUGH:

But as of this point we didn't ask

16
17

them because it has been granted.
But you asked why the Attorney General

18

disapproved these, and the problem — and that's really

what's the issue of this case, and Mr. McDuff said it.

What matters is not -- and I'll quote him from his oral

21

argument a few minutes ago -- "what matters is not the

is, he said in his letters time and again we don't object

that the results test is under section 2(b), not 2(a),

10

they also say that they don't intend to follow what this

Of course if that was wrong, your

remedy was in the District of Columbia, not by ignoring

the disapproval.

MR. PUGH:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I

think that the Justice Department -- that Congress enacted

Department is using it for an improper purpose, that
doesn't come up in Washington.

is a de novo proceeding, whether or not there is a purpose

No review absolutely

whatsoever of what the Justice, the merits of the Justice
Department's procedure and whether their objection was

It's a de novo proceeding.

I think this Court at

this time can review it.
Georgia v. United States, this Court reviewed
the Attorney General's regulations for preclearances.

A

majority of the Court said they are fine, a minority of
the Court said they are not.

But all of you agreed you

could review his regulations.

Where did that come from?

MR. PUGH:

That was --

QUESTION:

How did that get here?

MR. PUGH:

That was a three-judge court action

in Georgia, Your Honor.

It was not a D.C. court action.

Additionally -- and I think Justice White wrote
in his dissent in that case, is he said that he didn't
agree with the regulations.

He said that the Justice

the Justice Department had actually precleared them when

the Justice Department now says, now turns down, refuses

11

to preclear these very positions?
MR. PUGH:

They said that the approval of a

later position -- of the later positions and the later

increase in the number of judges constituted preclearance,

Your Honor.

considered because they have used the wrong one.

So

simply because the Justice Department used the wrong
reason in disapproving, I'm not sure that gives you the
remedy of simply deeming that they approved it.

They

disapproved it for the wrong reason, but don't they still
have a shot at disapproving it?
MR. PUGH:

Well, I think, in the nature of this

statute I think that's questionable, Your Honor, because
this is supposed to be a short, 60-day approval process.
And for them to say we're going to rewrite the statute and
make it say something it doesn't mean, wait until it goes
up to the U.S. Supreme Court and come back down, and
meanwhile you can't have any election of judges, I don't
-- I think that goes beyond the intent of the, what's
supposed to be a quick procedure under section 5.
QUESTION:

Well, it may well be that the initial

election can proceed, but your claim is that having used
the wrong reason, the Justice Department is disempowered
forever from passing upon the validity of the change.
MR. PUGH:

Well, Your Honor, additionally given

that they have conceded they have no problem with the
addition of the number, that all that they don't like is
the fact we elect them in Louisiana at large by designated
post, I think they have conceded -- now I guess one could

2

they could have done before.

we resubmitted them, and then on the basis of LULAC we

asked that they re-reconsider them.

It's just that they don't like our system.

QUESTION:

What do you mean by limited voting?

5

MR. PUGH:

Well, what — the Justice Department

6

suggested that as a remedy.

What limited voting is, Your

7

Honor, is that let's say that -- and they're suggesting

8

the section 2 context also.

9

Let's say that there are

If you can only vote for two of

10

those seats or three of those seats, then statistically

11

speaking if the minority population is a particular

12

percentage then they are guaranteed proportional, you

13

know, to have that number elected.

14

if you have eight seats, then they could cast all eight

15

votes for one judge, or four votes for two judges, or

16

whatever.

17
18
19

And cumulative voting,

It's a way to get proportional representation.

Well, by limited voting you don't

mean subdistricting?

No, ma'am.

they had, but I don't know how you would subdistrict one

MR. PUGH:

What can they make?

Yes, what kind of mistake can they

make which you would acknowledge can only be challenged in

MR. PUGH:

I think if the Justice Department

makes a decision erroneously on the facts in terms of

16

effects it would make the same, Your Honor.

17

problem with their argument here is where it's manifestly

18

beyond the reach of the statute that that's something that

there are changes from the present system that are

attack the present system, that that's so manifestly

And I think that

beyond the scope of section 5 that that can be reviewed.

It's, as Justice White said, if they said we're going to

I don't -- I wouldn't make it that

QUESTION:

That really would upset Congress'

scheme, though, to challenge the judicial review of the

Attorney General into the District of Columbia, wouldn't

for gross mistakes a three judge district court could

correct the Attorney General?

MR. PUGH:

Well, Your Honor, of course you

20

adjoined that dissent about the example that I gave.

21

guess I would state that, number one.

Number two, again, the District of Columbia

2

Attorney General, you can still go to the district court

3

in the District of Columbia, but as a de novo proceeding.

4

It doesn't review what he did at all.
QUESTION:

5

Well, but don't you think Congress

6

intended, albeit by a de novo proceeding rather than by

7

review of the Attorney General's act, to channel judicial

8

determination of preclearances in the District of

9

Columbia?
MR. PUGH:

But if you go here to the

Yes, sir, but I don't think Congress

11

envisioned that the Justice Department was going to ignore

12

this Court's decisions about what section 5 involves.

13

I think had Congress envisioned that they would say it

14

could come up here.

15

It's a de novo consideration.

16

And

It cannot come up in Washington.

So there's no way to review what they did.

17

they can continue to hold us hostage.

18

assume we win in Washington, these judgeships are

19

precleared.

20

huh.

21

preclear it.

22

we'll get a faster summary judgment in Washington.

is that possibility.

And

I mean, let's

Next year we want to add another judge.

Now, again, you don't have to -- maybe I

shouldn't say this, but you don't have to take that step

here in that the three-judge court held as a matter of

overturn, that judgeships were precleared.

I agree that the district court said it

that we got a letter from the Attorney General saying yes,

2

it's precleared, and the Attorney General says no, I never

3

sent the letter.

4

This is basically a legal question.

MR. PUGH:

Well, Your Honor, in McCain v.

5

Lybrand this Court held that the district court was

6

clearly erroneous in determining that preclearance of the

7

71 act precleared the 1966 act.

8

y'all applied in the McCain case.

9

— if that's the standard you applied there as to review

That was the standard
And so I think if it's

10

of the decision you would be applying the same standard

here.
