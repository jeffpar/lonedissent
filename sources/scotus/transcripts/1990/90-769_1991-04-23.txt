ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS AFTERGUT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

13
14

MR. AFTERGUT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Article II, section 6(b) of the California

15

Constitution provides that no political party or central

16

committee shall endorse, support, or oppose candidates in

17

nonpartisan elections — that is, elections for judicial,

18

school, county, or city office.

19

whether the people of California may in the nonpartisan

20

arena restrict the speech of those parties that have

21

chosen to accept the benefits that the State confers upon

22

its official parties in the partisan arena.

23

At issue in this case is

And because our argument so involves these

24

special advantages, I begin by describing them for the

25

Court, how parties get those advantages, and then I

proceed to discuss how they justify the balance that the

2

people of California have sought to strike between their

3

two systems, their partisan system and their nonpartisan

4

system.
QUESTION:

5

Would you mind inserting another

6

little item, which is to tell us how this case arises?

7

Now, the respondents are not political parties in the

8

State of California, are they?

9

MR. AFTERGUT:

They're voters?

The respondents include some

10

voters, Your Honor, and they include some individual

11

members of local central committees -- that is the local

12

organ in California of the State party.

13

correct, Your Honor, the respondents are not parties

14

themselves.

15

QUESTION:

16

in that light?

17

kind?

18

thought.

And so how do we address the question

Is it an overbreadth argument of some

I mean, 6(b) is addressed to political parties, I
Isn't that right?

MR. AFTERGUT:

QUESTION:

o

MR. AFTERGUT:

23

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, Your“Honor.

And we don't have a political party

22

24

But you are

Yes.

Only as amici, Your Honor.
And so how is it that we even

get to the question?
MR. AFTERGUT:

Well, these respondents, Your

Honor, seek — the way the case arises is they had — they

2

sought to place in the San Francisco voter pamphlet

3

endorsements either of them or endorsements by the

4

committees of which they were a member.

5

to have that endorsement circulated through the

6

government's publication, the ballot pamphlet to all

7

voters.

9

That's how the case arises.
QUESTION:

8

And they sought

Some of them were candidates who were

being endorsed?

10

MR. AFTERGUT:

I don't believe that's correct,

11

Your Honor, although I can't answer that question for

12

sure.

13

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps we should address some

14

of these questions to your opponent as to the standing of

15

respondents.

16

MR. AFTERGUT:

The way that the official parties

17

in California become official parties is by choice.

18

is California Election Code section 9951 provides the

19

mechanism by which a group seeks to become an official

20

party.

21

California Election Code defines parties as ballot-

22

qualified parties, so that when article II, section 6(b)

23

refers to parties, it is referring to ballot-qualified

24

parties, that is those who have chosen to take advantage

25

of the statutory benefits.

That

And I should also say that section 35 of the

QUESTION:

1

But what kind of — how did this case

2

get started?

These — you say these respondents wanted to

3

put their — wanted to recite in these pamphlets that

4

there had been endorsements?

MR. AFTERGUT:

MR. AFTERGUT:

MR. AFTERGUT:

QUESTION:

17

endorsements in the pamphlets.

18

Is that it?

That's correct, Your Honor.

Because they wanted to get these

MR. AFTERGUT:

In a pamphlet that is sent to all

19

voters in the city, and which we contend would make a

20

nonpartisan election partisan because these endorsements

21

would go to every voter in the City and County of San

22

Francisco.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And the grounds for refusing by the

official was that the State law forbade endorsements?
MR. AFTERGUT:

endorsements in nonpartisan elections.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. AFTERGUT:

4

QUESTION:

Exactly.
Yes.

Mr. Aftergut, could you tell me, this

5

constitutional provision which says that no political

6

party may endorse, support, or oppose a candidate for

7

nonpartisan office, does — would that prevent a political

8

party from contributing money for the candidate to promote

9

himself?

In other words, is it only addressed to an
Could the Republican Party support the

10

endorsement?

11

candidate so long as it did not say that he is the

12

Republican-endorsed candidate?

13

MR. AFTERGUT:

QUESTION:

15

17
18

No, Your Honor.

It could not?

It cannot contribute

money or do anything else to assist his campaign?
MR. AFTERGUT:

That's correct.

Support would

include that.
The advantages that political parties, official

19

political parties, ballot-qualified political parties get,

20

parties that have chosen to become official parties, are a

21

vast array of benefits.

22

for the Court so the Court understands.

23

I want to go through them quickly

First, a ballot-qualified party is a party that

24

has guaranteed access to the partisan ballot, to the

25

Statewide ballot.

Second, the State operates the
7

1

primaries for those ballot-qualified parties.
Third, the State assists those parties in

2

3

expanding their affiliation in a very special way.

4

voter registration card includes a list of the ballot-

5

qualified parties and only the ballot-qualified parties,

6

so that a voter registering marks which party he or she

7

wishes to affiliate with.
Fourth, the parties are entitled to receive free

8

9

The

of charge from the State a copy of the list of voter

10

affiliation — of the registered voters and their

11

affiliation.

12

Fifth, the official parties may send to this, to

13

the individuals on this list, those people that the State

14

has helped the parties affiliate with, may send them free

15

of charge a solicitation letter allowing the parties to

16

collect funds from these individuals.

17
18

QUESTION:

What do you mean send it free of

charge?

19

MR. AFTERGUT:

It is sent without expense to the

20

party with the sample ballot and the voter pamphlet that

21

go out.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. AFTERGUT:

24

QUESTION:

MR. AFTERGUT:

Oh, I see.
State law provides for that.

The State pays the postage.

It

can go out — the letter and the solicitation envelope

goes out.
Sixth, the State allows parties to receive a $25

3
4

tax contribution on the income tax form dedicated to that

5

party.

6

Seventh, the party meetings, the central

7

committee meetings, occur in the seat of government, in

8

the city hall, called by the clerk.

10

This is an array of

And why has California chosen to give its

11

official parties, those that have chosen to become

12

parties, why has California chosen to give them more

13

advantages than any other State?

14

with the nature of California itself, and has to do with

15

the decisions of this Court in the ballot access area.

16

The reason has to do

California, being the largest of our States and

17

being a State of tremendous diversity, finds a need to

18

promote parties in order to promote stability in such a

19

large and diverse State, in order to — parties help forge

20

consensus among diverse groups, as this Court has

21

recognized in the Storer case, in the Jenness case, in the

22

American Party v. White case.

23

balkanization of the political process so that government

24

can operate.

25

And parties help prevent a

So California has chosen to structure its

1

government, the people of California have chosen to

2

structure their government in this way, strengthening the

3

parties.

4

But there is a danger.

The danger is that

5

California at the same time has coexisting a nonpartisan

6

system, a strong nonpartisan system, a long tradition of

7

nonpartisanship that goes back to the progressive era in

8

Hiram Johnson.

9

fact is stronger than any other State because California

And that commitment to nonpartisanship in

10

is the only State in the country which absolutely

11

prohibits nonpartisan nomination in all local and all

12

school —

13

QUESTION:

Prohibits partisan nomination.

14

MR. AFTERGUT:

Excuse me, prohibits partisan

15

nominations in all local, all city, all county, all

16

school, all judicial elections.

17

QUESTION:

Well, how does 6(b) operate?

Now,

18

for example if there were a general election coming up and

19

there were some judicial candidates on the ballot, listed

20

on the ballot as nonpartisan, I take it that this

21

provision 6(b) might be said to prohibit, let's say, the

22

Democratic Party from preparing a little card to give to

23

registered Democrats by the precinct committeeman saying

24

these judicial candidates are candidates that we think

25

merit your support.

MR. AFTERGUT:

9

That's correct.

That's the position you take?
Yes.

And that is the only

sanction that exists in the State of California.

In other

10

words, there's no criminal penalty for an official party's

11

endorsing.

It's simply that some —

QUESTION:

But you can suppress the speech?

13

MR. AFTERGUT:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. AFTERGUT:

Well, the —

The political speech.
The government could bring an

16

action to enjoin that, or an individual could bring an

17

action to enjoin that, as happened in the Unger case.

QUESTION:

And how is it you think the First

Amendment would allow that?
MR. AFTERGUT:

For the reasons that I am saying,

21

Your Honor, that this is an essential part of the

22

structure of government that California has chosen.

is to say at the same --

MR. AFTERGUT:

2

That's correct, Your Honor, and

3

that was the point I was trying to develop in terms of a

4

difference that exists in California.

5

California gives to those parties that have chosen to

6

become official parties this vast array of benefits.

7

then secondly, California has this uniquely strong

8

comprehensive commitment to nonpartisanship.

And that is to say

And

And so what California is saying when it speaks

10

to its official parties, those that have made the choice

11

of becoming official parties, it has given to them a

choice.

advantages in order to assist in organizing our political

14

system across the State.

15

benefits there is a danger.

16

State — the State by giving to parties that have chosen

17

to take advantage of these benefits — the State itself

18

will be weighing into the nonpartisan arena.

First Amendment analysis can just offer additional

benefits as a sort of quid pro quo for giving up First

the voice of parties in a way that will put them, if they

QUESTION:

11

You describe all of the initial

12

regulations that you'd recited as benefits.

13

parties are required by law to have the meetings that you

14

have described; are they not?

15

MR. AFTERGUT:

I take it

believe you're correct that official parties are required,

although I am not, I must say I am not certain.

point is —

QUESTION:

But the

Of course it's required by law that

they meet at a particular time and place as designated.

So these aren't just benefits, they're regulations.

Honor.

MR. AFTERGUT:

1

The Democratic Party can — the

2

Democratic Party can, absolutely, get its candidate on the

3

ballot for -- I'm not sure about for a primary election,

4

but it can definitely —

5

QUESTION:

Well, that's critical, isn't it?

6

MR. AFTERGUT:

It can get its candidate on the

7

ballot by doing what any other group does, and that is by

8

gathering the number of signatures that are necessary in

9

order to get on the ballot.

The Democratic Party has

10

chosen to take advantage of these benefits, and the price

11

for taking advantage of those benefits that California

12

exacts in order to protect the nonpartisan structure of

13

its government from the enhanced voice that these benefits

14

give to parties is to say we need this restriction in

15

order to keep parties from occupying the central place in

16

local government and in judicial government.

17

QUESTION:

So you say there is a way for a

18

political party to get on the ballot without becoming an

19

official party?

MR. AFTERGUT:

That's correct.

I'm not sure of the answer to

You're talking about general

18

elections, because for a primary you have to be an

MR. AFTERGUT:

the party may operate like anybody else if it — if the

protect its other structure, that is its nonpartisan

the experience of California that led to this — led to

this regulation, to the whole tradition of

nonpartisanship.

4

And it exists for the reasons that Madison

acknowledged, and that is that in smaller localities

6

single parties do tend to dominate, and there is a danger

7

from that that does not exist across broader geographic

lines where there is a greater balance.

And so what you have in cities like our city,

12

what happens is that if the State has enhanced the voice

of these particular entities, you have exactly the same

indeed the California court of appeal recently in a case

from expressing itself in an election, and we said it was

justified because the danger of corruption and because the

4

State had given the corporation certain benefits.
MR. SMITH:

5

Well, I said there are two

6

distinctions, though.

One is that the Michigan statute

7

didn't go nearly as far as this provision does, because

8

this is an absolute prohibition and this Court's opinion,

9

as well as concurrence by Justice Brennan, were very

10

explicit that they were saying it was not an absolute

11

prohibition, because the Michigan corporation could set up

12

a wholly controlled PAC.

13

to its members, send any endorsement it wanted.

14

Michigan corporation could endorse all it wanted, it just

15

was limited in direct expenditure money from the corporate

17

The second point is what Austin and

Massachusetts Citizens for Life make very clear is that

19

the problem was not that the corporation got ’benefits,

20

because there would not be necessity to exempt any

21

corporations, including wholly political corporations.

was just mere receipt of benefits does it.

that it gave corporations advantage in the economic

money over into the political marketplace.
