ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

11

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Florida's tax

12

on intangible property fails this Court's internal

13

consistency test and violates the Commerce Clause.

14

will explain in a moment, we think the case is controlled

15

by the Court's decision in Armco, which struck down a

16

facially discriminatory West Virginia tax that we think is

17

indistinguishable from the Florida statute.

18

As I

The Florida tax is imposed annually on the full

19

value of two different categories of accounts receivable

20

notes and other obligations.

21

domicile, the other one is based on business situs.

22

First, if a — an intangible asset is owned by a Florida

23

domiciliary, it is subject to the tax without regard to

24

its business situs.

25

Florida business situs, which is defined in the statute to

1

mean that it arose out of a sale of property in Florida,

2

it too is subject to the tax, but only if it is owned by a

3

nondomiciliary.

4

There seems to be no dispute here that the tax

5

fails a straightforward application of the Court's

6

internal consistency test, and that is so because if every

7

State had the precise statute that Florida has, a

8

interstate company operating in interstate commerce,

9

domiciled in one State, selling — financing sales in

10

another State, would pay two taxes.

11

domiciliary State, under the domicile theory, another to

12

the business situs State under the business situs theory.
QUESTION:

14

One tax to his

Have we previously extended the

internal consistency test to property taxes?

15

MR. EVANS:

Well, the answer to that is slightly

16

involved in this sense.

17

property taxes in the name of an internal consistency

18

test, but as we showed in our opening brief, the first

19

instance that we could find of the Court actually using an

20

internal consistency analysis was a century ago in a case

21

involving a tax, a property tax, on the value of capital

22

stock of a company that, that owned moving -- moving rail

23

cars.

24

that the test itself, the analysis that underlies it is so

25

deeply rooted, the answer to the question is, I think,

It has not been extended to

And to that extent we think, because we do think

1

that the Court has applied it to a property tax and in

2

fact a tax in that case which was on intangible value.

3

Just let me spell out again why I think there is

4

a — why I think there is an internal consistency problem.

5

If you're operating in two States — domiciled in one and

6

financing in the other, you pay a domicile tax in effect

7

to your domicile State, a business situs tax to your

8

business situs State.

9

one State, you pay only a domiciliary tax to your home

But if you are operating in just

10

State.

The result is that an intrastate company who

11

confines its operations, its financing operations to just

12

its own State, pays one tax, while its competitors have to

13

pay two.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. --

15

QUESTION:

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Evans, the thing that makes the

17

tax burdensome is the tax on the domiciliary, isn't it?
MR. EVANS:

18

No, we don't see it that way.

19

tax is identical in our view to the tax that was at issue

20

it really isn't — is really interstate commerce versus

No.

We're hurt by the — by the

prospect that we are -- and the fact that we are taxed in

21

Florida on the basis of the business situs of our

22

intangibles there, where our competing intrastate local

And the risk itself is not, is not a cost-free

2

risk.

We bear that risk every day when we compete in a

very competitive financial services market in Florida,

where the success or failure can turn on very small

margins.

he knows that he will never be taxed a second time on that

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION:

1

The problem is that the whole, the

2

whole internal consistency test is based upon prospective

3

damage and not actual damage, isn't it?

4

MR. EVANS:

It is.

That's correct.

The test is

5
QUESTION:

6

Because it doesn't matter whether you

7

are actually being taxed twice, it's the theoretical

8

possibility of your being taxed twice that causes us to

9

apply the test.

10

MR. EVANS:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So it's sort of hard to get upset

12

about potentiality as a basis for standing, if you are

13

going to apply that kind of a test.

14

MR. EVANS:

Well, I think, Justice Scalia, there

15

is, although I know some members of the Court don't

16

necessarily agree, there is good reason for viewing the

17

test as a hypothetical test.

them.

of the Commerce Clause.

4

focuses on risks and focuses on the possibility of other

States doing something similar to what the challenge

7

century, so far as we can tell.

9

Because, as I

It may have gone back

We couldn't find anything further back.
QUESTION:

Well, I — you certainly can cite

10

language in the Pullman Palace-Car, but to say that was

11

the precise rationale of the decision was the -- an

12

internal consistency — I think pushes the language a

13

little far.

14

MR. EVANS:

We don't say it was the whole

15

rationale of the case, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

that it was an instance in which the Court found it useful

17

to look at what other States might -- what would happen if

18

other States used the same taxing mechanism.

19

We do think

Let me just run through why I think it would not

20

be a good idea to open up to actual double taxation

21

showings in every case.

First of all, every — every case

22

would produce a lawsuit.

There would be no mechanism by

23

which these things would be resolved other than by

24

litigation.

25

A, say Florida, adjudicating what Michigan in fact is

Second, you would have the anomaly of State

1

taxing.

There may be an argument, for example, in a

2

lawsuit brought by Ford that it is fact being taxed by

3

Michigan on the basis of domicile, to which a State

4

counsel might respond well, we don't really see it that

5

way.

6

that the State court reads it?

7

definitive authority, but we paid our bill.

8

not enough, we don't see it that way.

Do you have any authority for that being the way
Well, we don't have any
Well, that is

So the first issue in the State court is going

9
10

to be whether Michigan in fact taxes domicile.

11

does, the second argument for the State's lawyer is, well,

12

it's not valid.

13

of the State of Florida having to adjudicate both the

14

meaning and the validity of a Michigan statute, taxing

15

statute.

16

And if it

Somehow we stumbled along for 190

6

MR. EVANS:

Well, I think what the Court

stumbled along with was an internal consistency analysis

8

without the label on it, because the cases repeatedly

reflect the Court assuming, for the sake of consideration

10

of a tax, that other States might, in fact probably will,

consistency test to make two challenges in its brief to

2

Florida's intangible taxes, one based on the situs tax

3

alone, and one to the situs tax combined with the

4

domiciliary tax.

5

here this morning, and we, I believe, have answered it

6

fully in our brief by pointing out that there is no

7

internal consistency problem resulting from the situs test

8

itself.

9

Ford has not pressed the first argument

So I would like to move directly to the second

10

point, which is the combination of the situs and the

11

domiciliary tax, and set out, if I may, just briefly at

12

the beginning, what our position is on that.

13

it is this.

14

consistency test to strike down a taxing scheme when the

15

hypothetical tax is based on domicile, and so the taxes of

16

only one other State are likely to be at issue, and when a

17

relatively simply factual inquiry shows that the taxpayer

18

in fact paid only one tax on its property, just like its

19

local competitors.

20

Simply put,

That the Court shouldn't use the internal

The situation typically in which the Court has

21

used the internal consistency test, as the Court has noted

22

in using it, have been cases where when one hypothesizes

23

the use of the — of a particular tax, one might

24

conceivably be looking to cumulative taxation by 49 other

25

States on the same basis.

That is simply not a situation

1

that arises in the case of the tax based on domicile.

2

that kind of situation we know in advance that there is

3

likely to be only one other State that is asserting taxing

4

jurisdiction, and you do not have the same kind of

5

impractical inquiry that you would have with manufacturing

6

taxes and selling taxes, which could be levied for a

7

particular taxpayer by a number of different States, when

8

the basis of the hypothetical tax is, as it is in this

9

case, simply domicile.
QUESTION:

10

Well, I think -- I suppose you would

11

argue then if Michigan had exactly the same scheme as

12

Florida, that both — both States' tax laws would be

13

valid?

14

MR. FARR:

Well, we would in fact make such an

15

argument based on the Due Process Clause cases.

16

there, what I am saying here --

17
18

QUESTION:

In

But

Because you think the domiciliary

basis for taxation is perfectly valid.
MR. FARR:

19

That there is an additional basis for

20

taxation provided by domicile, as the Court has

21

recognized, that goes beyond the usual situs basis.

22

that is not the necessary part of the argument I'm making

here.

24

question to look and see whether in fact Michigan had this

25

tax, and very easy to see that it did not.

What I'm saying here is that it is a very simple

So in fact,

1

when we move away from the hypothetical and move to actual

2

practical considerations, it is absolutely clear that Ford

3

paid only one tax on its Florida intangibles.

4

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Farr, why can't we do that

5

with companies, like in Armco, that have only one

6

manufacturing plant?

7

MR. FARR:

What I am looking at, I think,

8

Justice Stevens, is the general run of cases.

9

there would be exceptions in any particular setting of the

10

I think

internal consistency test.
QUESTION:

11

Yeah, but most taxpayers don't have

12

plants in 49 States, and if you look at the general run of

13

Florida out-of-state companies, presumably there is one

14

from each of the 49 other States.

15

survey the tax you would have to look at all the home

16

States, wouldn't you?

So that to really

You can do it for each one, one at a

20

When you are looking at any,

a challenge by any particular taxpayer.

22

though, that goes to the very heart of what we're talking

about.

taxation or discrimination against another taxpayer from

It may be possible for using the internal

1

another State, which is what Ford is trying to do.

2

we're saying is that where you don't have the kind of

3

difficult factual inquiry that is likely to arise in other

4

settings, there is no reason to move past Ford's

5

particular situation, which shows that it did not pay a

6

domiciliary tax, and thus paid a single tax only.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

What

Is it perfectly clear that the

domiciliary State would be Michigan and not Delaware?
MR. FARR:

There has been no argument about it

10

in this particular case, Your Honor, and I don't think it

11

would make any difference.

12

13

QUESTION:

Delaware has not --

Except it makes it two you have to

look at instead of one.

14

MR. FARR:

It might in a possible case.

15

QUESTION:

Yeah.

16

MR. FARR:

I mean there is, frankly, I think

17

there's a question after Wheeling Steel v. Fox whether a

18

domiciliary State which bases its claim to domicile solely

19

on incorporation would in fact be able to tax.

20

that would arise, but that is at least a possible

21

consideration.

22

QUESTION:

So I doubt

Under your view, Mr. Farr, if

23

Michigan had a tax and Ford could show double taxation in

24

this case, and if the Court, when it went on to say that

25

this was a violation of the Commerce Clause, would the tax

1

then be invalid just as Ford, so that companies that came

2

from States that did not have the domiciliary tax would

3

still have to pay the tax?

4

its face?

5

theory would work.

6

Or is the tax struck down in

Or -- I don't know how it would, how your

MR. FARR:

The suggestion I am making, I

7

believe, Justice Kennedy, is that in this kind of

8

situation for this type of claim, that really the tax

9

should be looked at as applied to a particular taxpayer.

10

So that a statute that has essentially what might be

11

argued to be a logical inconsistency but causes no harm to

12

a particular taxpayer should not be struck down with

13

regard to that taxpayer.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Do we have examples in our

jurisprudence where this approach has been followed?
MR. FARR:

Well, there are certainly examples

17

where the Court has said, for example in Northwestern

18

States Cement, which is 358 U.S., the Court says we are

19

not going to look at a hypothetical claim.

20

actual double taxation in this case, therefore we will no

21

go on and address the question of whether there is a

22

hypothetical problem with the statute itself.

23

me that is a perfectly sound basis where the inquiry as to

24

the particular taxpayer can be made relatively

25

straightforwardly.

There is no

It seems to

And I think this is an obvious example

1

of that kind of case.
Taking for a moment the inquiry that I am

2

3

proposing, which, as I say, departs somewhat from the idea

4

of using hypothetical taxing burdens and looking at actual

5

burdens, what — what do we see in this case?

6

said, we see that Ford has not paid a domiciliary tax to

7

Michigan, and indeed hasn't paid one to Delaware either,

8

should that be the possible alternative.

9

what Ford really puts most of its emphasis on, you turn to

As I have

When you look at

10

the question of what are the risks of double taxation.

11

And there concededly is language in the Court's opinion

12

that talk about risk as part of Commerce Clause analysis.
But I would like to suggest that it's worth

13
14

taking a hard look in a case like this at what the risks

15

really are, because risks are very easy to exaggerate.

16

What do we know about the risk that Ford faced in

17

Michigan, its domicile State, in 1980, 1981, and 1982,

18

which are the years, the taxing years that are in question

19

here?

20

the risk of a domiciliary tax didn't materialize.

21

Michigan did not impose the tax during those years in

22

question.

The first thing we know about them is that in fact

23

Second, and more importantly, we know that the

24

risk, at best, because of the nature of Ford's argument,

25

is simply a marginal risk.

Ford has based its argument

1

here solely on the internal consistency clause.

2

concedes, as it has to, that if in those years Michigan

3

had had a domiciliary tax and Ford — excuse me, and

4

Florida had had a situs tax, so long as Florida didn't

5

itself have a domiciliary tax, the two statutes together

6

would meet the internal consistency test.

7

Yet Ford

So what that leaves Ford with when it talks

8

about risks is essentially an incremental risk, the idea

9

that Michigan wouldn't tax its domiciliary corporations on

10

its own.

11

copy cat fashion, because Florida has done so.

12

there, I might suggest, that if Michigan were to consider

13

a domiciliary tax, what you don't have in this case is

14

what you have in so many Commerce Clause cases, the

15

difficulty of an out-of-state corporation facing taxing

16

decisions by a State in which it's not located.

17

talking about the possibility of a tax imposed by Ford's

18

own domicile, where Ford presumably has substantial

19

political power.

It would only do so essentially in sort of a

QUESTION:

And even

We are

Mr. Farr, the test you propose really

ends up, doesn't it, to create all sorts of odd incentives

for companies to do business in some States or not?

basis, and that is you showed an actual conflict --

Then you would have to decide the

QUESTION:

took in cases like Curry v. McCanless.

MR. FARR:

1

That's correct, Justice White.

Following the due process cases from the late 1930's and

1940's, I would argue that because of the special nature

of a domiciliary corporation and the —

— benefits that the Court has

recognized the State gives, that it could indeed have

decide that issue in a case where no domiciliary tax on

Ford has been imposed.

12

that Ford is raising.

13

QUESTION:

And that is, I think, the point

Well, I suppose that if Michigan had

a tax like Florida's on domiciliaries, it would certainly

be -- it certainly would put a -- it certainly would

deter, I suppose, a domiciliary in Michigan from doing

that.

MR. FARR:

In the sense that it would then be

subject to double taxation.
QUESTION:

Why, yes, yes.

And if you are going

to pay, if you would have to pay two taxes on your

possibility.

I would say that the issues of double

2

taxation, precisely the point that you are making though,

3

is what the Court spent really a decade and a half

4

wrestling with from about 1930 until the early 1940's,

5

exactly trying to draw the kinds of distinctions that you

6

are making —

7

QUESTION:

And never got a fall.

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry?

9

QUESTION:

And never pinned.

10

Never, never got

— and it never pinned anybody.
MR. FARR:

11

Well, it came closer to pinning at

12

the end, I think, when it made its second reversal, if I

13

can continue the wrestling metaphor, to say that in fact

14

there was a legitimacy to double taxation of intangibles

15

by both the domiciliary State and the situs State.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, can I suggest a problem

17

with your approach?

Supposing this challenge had been

18

brought not by Ford challenging the situs aspect of the

tax, but by a Florida domiciliary, making precisely the

same argument?

QUESTION:

I see.

It's the fact that the

hypothetical tax is the burden on the domiciliary that is

what you —
MR. FARR:

6

That's correct.

I mean, as I — to

7

me, and perhaps this is a misstatement, but as I see the

8

internal consistency test, it essentially carves out an

9

exception to general constitutional principles of how you

10

approach an attack under — on constitutional ground State

11

statutes.

12

reasons for essentially allowing the tax — the to be

13

based on hypothetical grounds, that maybe the usual

practice should yield.

where the hypothetical tax is the domicile.

And it seems to me where there are practical

But I don't see it in the case

I would like to just say one more thing about

17

the subject of risk, again because I think Ford has given

it considerable emphasis.

19

don't disagree that there was this marginal risk that I

20

mentioned before, this incremental risk that Ford might be

21

subject to tax by Michigan.

22

that as a basis for challenging the Florida statute, it

does seem appropriate to remember that the Florida

Florida as did Ford, but in fact were subject to a real

And one question I suppose I would raise here

is, for all their talk about multiple burdens and

discrimination and lack of allocation, is there any

reasonable likelihood that in 1980, 1981, or 1982 Ford

8

would have changed places with the Florida domiciliary

MR. FARR:

Not to my knowledge, Justice Stevens.

21

I would like to make one final point on the

22

question of the particular type of inquiry here.

Florida took action that met internal consistency, it

would not be necessarily entitled to a refund.

Ford

In Tyler

1

Pipe this Court pointed out that any problem with internal

consistency in that case could be solved for out-of-state

3

manufacturers by providing a credit against the out-of-

state tax on the tax levied by the State of Washington in

that case.
Assuming that Florida could do the same thing

7

here, and we don't see any reason why they couldn't simply

8

to achieve the consistency that Florida is talking about,

9

ultimately that credit would do Ford no good whatsoever.

10

It has nothing in fact to credit from its domiciliary

11

State.

12

difference because a Florida corporation arguably gets a

13

credit against one tax and only has to pay once, even if

14

Florida applied exactly the same rule to Ford, there would

15

be no difference whatsoever in the judgment that is in

16

front of the Court at this point, the judgment that says

17

they owe the taxes for 1980, 1981, and 1982.

So to the extent that there is a superficial

Stevens' concurring opinion in the Goldberg case, which is

that the fact that one State cedes or declines to adopt a

share.

And it, it reminds me,

I think that in — there are about half of the

10
11

States that, at least as we have identified in a rough

12

survey, that have some form of intangible taxation.

13

five or six of them, or so, look pretty much like

Florida's.

something that was also in the brief that I just want to

address briefly.

7

the 1940's, late 1930's and 1940's, on due process grounds

8

bear on the issue here, we think is really quite far

9

fetched.

The notion that the Court's decisions in

Those cases were due process cases where the

10

issue was one issue only, namely did a nondomiciliary

11

State have the jurisdiction to tax property owned by —

12

that was in the State but that was not owned by one of its

13

own domiciliaries, and the answer to that question was

14

yes.

15

about multiple taxation, because the issue was a due

16

process issue, and not an interstate -- impeding of

17

interstate commerce issue.

There was never any consideration in those cases

18

The fact is that the one time when the author of

19

the key opinion, Chief Justice Stone, addressed the issue,

20

he specifically said, and we quoted this in our reply

21

brief, which I am not finding right now, this was in his

22

dissenting opinion in Northwest Airlines at 332 U.S.

23

said, in response really to an argument that Mr. Farr has

24

made, that yes, domicile can be important and it can give

a basis for State taxation of intangibles that might

intangibles, when it's — when they are owned by

Well, I think the citation is —
Okay — we can check it out.
I will double check it.

My mistake.

In response to the argument he also cited a

number of other cases dealing with, and these are also

cases that did deal with the possible problem of multiple

taxation of intangible property, going back — back again

11

into the 19th century.
Now,

12

Mr. Farr said that the risk that we face

13

Furthermore, firms generally, although

Florida that it cannot adopt a — an internally consistent
