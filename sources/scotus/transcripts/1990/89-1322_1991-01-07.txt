They're not doing business in the State

MR. MILEY:

4

No, no.

If they don't have a presence

within the State — if they merely ship on common carrier

6

to a certain location, they have — there's no sufficient

7

nexus if they don't have any trucks or warehouse or anything

8

in Oklahoma, we can't make those other wholesalers pay the

tax.

10

So, at that point, although it is perfectly fine

for

course, as this Court has held in the United States Fidelity

and Guaranty case in 1932 and again in the Puyallup case in

14

1977, this tribe is immune from suit.

15

And so that brings

However, it is my position that circumstances have

16

changed such that this doctrine should be reexamined.

17

in 1932 that case involved a lawsuit by the United States

18

to protect tribal coal royalties that were owed to the tribe

19

and the tribe was held to be immune from a counterclaim in

20

that suit because the United States Government was trying

21

to protect the fragile existence of the tribal ward, and it

22

was necessary in that circumstance.

23

scope of the tribal entity has increased greatly from those

24

days and they are not reaching into the community of the

State where State laws do apply.

The relief that the Tenth Circuit

21

granted was simply a reverse remanded for entry of order as

22

prayed for, and the order that was prayed for by the tribe

was simply an injunction against the proposed assessment.
