the Court:

The issue in this case is whether a claim that a

13

section 1983.

against every person who under color of any statute of any

16

State subjects any citizen of the United States to any --

17

to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities

18

secured by the Constitution.

The pertinent part of section 1983 provides

19

In this case the Supreme Court of Nebraska upheld

20

petitioner's claim that a Nebraska truck tax that he was

21

required to pay violated the commerce clause and it affirmed

22

a permanent injunction that the trial court had granted the

23

petitioner in joining respondents, who were certain State

24

tax officials, from collecting the tax.

our

position

that

whatever

benefits may be derived to individuals as a result of the

existence of the commerce clause and the dormant commerce

no individual businesses or persons who would fit the, the

requirement of being intended beneficiaries of the clause?

That's correct.
