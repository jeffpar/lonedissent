ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. SCARBORO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SCARBORO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented for review in this case

10
11

is whether a convicted prisoner who is summoned to appear

12

as a witness in a proceeding in the court in the United

13

States is entitled to a witness fee pursuant to 28 United

14

States Code, section 1821—

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCARBORO:

This was a convicted State prisoner?
That's correct, Your Honor — for

17

the time that that person spends in attendance at a court

18

of the United States.

19

Demarest, was in 1988 and continues to be a prisoner

20

incarcerated in the State of Colorado, by the State of

21

Colorado.

22

The petitioner here, Richard

In March of 1988, Judge Jim Carrigan of the

23

United States District Court in Denver issued a writ of

24

habeas corpus ad testificandum by which Mr. Demarest was

25

transported from prison in Crawley, Colorado to Denver

County jail where he remained for a little more than a

2

month.
During 8 days of that period the trial in the

3
4

underlying criminal case took place.

5

Mr. Demarest testified as a witness for the defense.

6

the case was over Mr. Demarest made an application to the

7

deputy clerk in the district court to certify his

8

entitlement to a witness fee pursuant to 28 United States

9

Code, section 1825.

On one of those days

That is the statute that governs the

10

procedure whereby a witness applies for a fee when the

11

witness is being paid by the United States.

12
13

QUESTION:

When

Do you mean when the witness — the

United States would pay the fee in this case?

14

MR. SCARBORO:

15

QUESTION: .What, because, what -- that's because

of this provision of 1825?

17

MR. SCARBORO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

18

There are several related provisions involved.

Mr. Scarboro?

MR. SCARBORO:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes?

If it's an ordinary witness does he

pay his own travel or does somebody pay his travel?

13

MR. SCARBORO:

No, in the ordinary case, Your

14

Honor, if a person is going to serve as a witness in a

15

case and the parties are able to pay the fee, you tender a

16

witness fee and travel expenses to the witness when you

That's what happens in the ordinary

A fee plus travel.
That's correct.

Now, in this case the Government paid

MR. SCARBORO:

In this case the State of

Colorado or the United States Government.

25

which paid for the travel.

That's right.

MR. SCARBORO:

10

He did not, Your

Honor.

That's correct.

So the county jail fed him.
That's correct.

So his out-of-pocket expenses were

zero?

11

MR. SCARBORO:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And he is not asserting any right to

13

expenses in this case.

14

the statute in section 1821 and subsections (c) and (d)

15

which entitle a witness to reimbursement for expenses.

16

Mr. Demarest is not seeking reimbursement for any

17

expenses.

of the $30 per day witness fee pursuant to subsection a(l)

of section 1821 which provides for the payment of those

fees .

1

QUESTION:

He was a defense witness.

2

MR. SCARBORO:

Mr. Demarest made his application

3

to the clerk and the clerk referred the request to the

4

assistant United States attorney.

5

States attorney denied the request on the ground that Mr.

6

Demarest was a convicted prisoner and therefore unentitled

7

to receive a witness fee.

8

9

The assistant United

Mr. Demarest, proceeding on his own behalf,
thereafter filed this lawsuit.

And he sued both the

10

clerk and the deputy clerk seeking to compel them to pay

11

to certify his entitlement to a fee, which then would be

12

paid by the United States Marshal.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Scarboro, the Government says

14

that a witness has to be subpoenaed under the statute

15

before he can be deemed to be in attendance under the

16

terms of the statute.

17

MR. SCARBORO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That

18

is the technical argument that the Government makes with

19

regard to the meaning of the statute.

20

position is very simple and that is that if this statute

21

means what it says, he is a witness and he was in

22

attendance in at a court of the United States and served

23

as a witness.

24

appears and gives testimony, then he is that person.

25

also served as a witness as we ordinarily understand the

Mr. Demarest's

If the words in attendance mean someone who

He

1

meaning of the word witness.
The Government makes a technical argument with

2

3

regard to the language in attendance and says that Mr.

4

Demarest was not in attendance because he wasn't

5

personally subpoenaed.

6

writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.

7

He did appear pursuant to that, to that writ.

10

Never uses it.

13

Section 1821 doesn't define the word in

attendance except to say, in attendance.

11
12

That's accurate.

Section 1821 doesn't mention the word subpoena.

8

9

Instead he appeared pursuant to a

QUESTION:

But section 1825 uses the term

subpoena?
MR. SCARBORO:

Yes, yes, it does.

It does use

14

the word subpoena, Your Honor.

15

section 1825 in the following way.

16

sets out how a witness for the Government, in a case where

17

the Government is a party, is to be paid when the person

18

is being paid by the United States.

19

on to say, in the case of defense witnesses summoned

20

pursuant to a subpoena, the following procedure shall be

21

used for payment.

22

section 1825 but I submit that all it means, that the

23

common sense of it is, that there be some kind of formal

24

process by which a court certifies that --

25

QUESTION:

That word is used in
Section 1825 first

Then the statute goes

The word subpoena also appears in

issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses in

criminal trials.

Mr. Demarest did appear pursuant to a formal procedure.

Judge Carrigan —

I see.

5

MR. SCARBORO:

— issued an order that gave him

oversight, judicial oversight over the proceedings.

You're in attendance on those days, but if you're coming

This is, this Court has held that

in Hurtado, they're in attendance.

I don't understand why a person in a

Oh, then they'd be comparable to

Yes.

-- if they're in custody.
And then —

But not if they're in a private

mental institution I don't suppose?

MR. SCARBORO:

QUESTION:

No.

Probably not.
But you're just saying if

they -- in a different area of Government custody.

18

don't know why that's a different case than this one.

MR. SCARBORO:

I don't either, Your Honor.

But

20

I take it the Government's position would be that person

he's going to be compelled — his jailer is going to be

QUESTION:

He's going to be,

Well, you raise an interesting

7

question — what about the defendant in his own trial?

Is

And does he get a fee?

MR. SCARBORO:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCARBORO:

The defendant —

I don't think he does.
-- in his own trial is, is, I

12

would say he's in attendance.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCARBORO:

But they've never paid them fees.
That's right, Your Honor.

The

15

normal understanding of the word witness is to the best of

16

my knowledge a person who is not a party but a person who

17

attends a trial of a party and testifies.

18

literally that a person who is a party may testify.

19

QUESTION:

It's also true

You say that the — when a defendant

20

is testifying the defendant is not a witness within the

21

meaning of the statute?

22

MR. SCARBORO:

23
24
25

That's correct, Your Honor, not

with the meaning of 1821.
It seems to me that the Government's position in
this case rests not really upon these linguistic

1

distinctions about the words in attendance and witness,

2

but instead about — on a perception of the purpose of

3

this statute combined with administrative practice, and I

4

would like to spend just a few moments dealing with those

5

two, I think, more central points.

6

The argument is made by respondents from the

7

legislative history of this statute that its purpose is to

8

compensate the average witness for the time that that

9

witness spends testifying and the costs that the witness

10

incurs.

11

a remarkable conclusion and that is —
QUESTION:

12

13

From this the Government leaps to what I think is

Cost, Mr. Scarboro, in the sense of

loss of income and that sort of thing?

14

MR. SCARBORO:

Yes.

Two kinds of costs, Your

15

Honor.

16

of pocket expenses some of which are reimbursed but as a

17

practical matter probably all are not.

18
19
20

One would be lost income.

QUESTION:

The other would be out

The, the — don't witnesses get some

sort of reimbursement for — for travel?
MR. SCARBORO:

Yes, they do, Your Honor and

21

subsections (c) and (d) of section 1821 deal with the

22

situation in which you can — a witness is entitled to

23

receive actual reimbursement for certain kinds of

24

transportation and entitled to an allowance —

25

QUESTION:

instance.
MR. SCARBORO:

That, that's, that's what I

10

wanted to turn to, Justice White, and the point is simply

11

this, that the Government says it wouldn't serve any

12

purpose to compensate a person like Mr. Demarest.

13

14

Incidentally, that's not a point that is established in

15

this record.

16

whether Mr. Demarest worked in the prison, if so, whether

17

he made wages, and if he made wages whether he lost them

18

when he was transported to Denver County jail to testify.

19

He

He is not losing any compensation.

It is known from this record whether,

But be that as it may, it seems to me that the

20

Government's methodology stands the ordinary principles of

21

statutory construction that have been announced by this

22

Court in case after case after case on, on its head.

23

by that I mean that ordinarily this Court has said a

24

supposed purpose is not used to override the plain meaning

25

of a statute when the words are clear and the reason for

that is that ordinarily the meaning that Congress

it is those legislative commands that are ordinarily the

6

best evidence about what Congress intended.

7

Congress doesn't speak in terms of

It speaks in terms of legislative commands and

Furthermore, there is nothing inconsistent

8

between the purpose that the Government supposes Congress

9

had and paying a fee to convicted prisoners.

And the

10

reason is this.

Congress was undoubtedly aware that

11

people do not suffer the same kinds of economic losses or

12

lose the same amount of compensation for testifying.

13

Congress undoubtedly was aware that many people don't lose

14

money at all, people who live on fixed incomes, people who

15

are — who survive by independent means.

16

kinds of people who do not necessarily suffer any economic

17

loss by virtue of testifying, but the statute simply says

18

all witnesses, a witness is entitled to a fee.

There are all

Which is peculiar.

MR. SCARBORO:

Yes, it's very — section 1825

of situations.

QUESTION:

10

Yes, well, I, I would say that is

some indication that a witness who is not subpoenaed is

not to be paid fees period since there's no provision for

13

how they're to be paid.

14

whether nonsubpoenaed witnesses get fees, I'd say that

certainly indicates how that ambiguity ought to be

16

resolved, wouldn't you think?

17

MR. SCARBORO:

If there's any ambiguity about

That's possible, Your Honor, but

18

it seems to me that the main point ought to be what is

Mr. Scarboro, would I be helping you

out if I suggested that 1825(a) was directed not to the

to issue the certificate, which is a condition precedent

I want to make a couple of points about the

purpose of this statute.

to some extent about the purpose of the law.

of section (a)(1), of section 1821, 28 United States Code,

MR. SCARBORO:

People who have no income.

7

People — very often employers actually continue to pay

wages to their employees even though those employees are

taking a day to serve as a witness in a case.

There are

10

many good reasons why Congress may have chosen to

legislate in an overinclusive fashion or in a generality,

such as the use of the word witness, including

administrative convenience and there may have been another

reason.

QUESTION:

1

Well, what I'm, what I'm suggesting

2

is that the procedure that 1825 addresses may well be

3

simply a procedure for distinguishing some witnesses who

4

cannot be paid without the certification of a public

5

defender or a clerk of court as opposed to witnesses who

6

may be paid on certification of a United States Marshal.

7

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, that's true because in

8

1825(a) you'll notice that there's no provision for

9

paying — when the Government subpoenas a witness the same

10

requirements don't obtain.
QUESTION:

11

So, I guess what that — well, that

12

leads to my second question and that is on your reading,

13

which if I understand it correctly is that there must a

14

subpoena before a defense witness may be paid, that would

15

still allow the payment of a defense witness — I'm sorry,

16

that would still allow for the payment of the witness fee

17

to a prisoner called by the Government, wouldn't it?

18

MR. LAZERWITZ:

No, and let me explain why.

19

First of all, 1825 -- there are two separate questions and

20

one is — the first question, the first point that we

21

raise in our brief, admittedly belatedly, which is whether

22

this particular witness — we do concede that Mr. Demarest

23

was a witness -- presented the right pieces of paper to be

24

paid.

25

that's before this Court, is what is the meaning of 1821,

The second question, and the broader question

and we submit that it makes sense to look at section 1825,

2

the procedures, in order to understand what Congress was

3

dealing with in section 1821.

4

5

this case for our position.

6

together what's out there and understand the statute.

7

the fact that there's been this 200-year practice,

8

starting with the first witness fee statute, suggests to

9

us that you can't write this case off out of plain

meaning.
QUESTION:

11

Well, fair enough, but the

12

administrative practice issue is the, is really a separate

13

argument.

14

you have fob distinguishing between some prisoners, at

15

least, and nonprisoner witnesses is the language of

16

1825(a).

17

do you?

18

Isn't it true that the only textual basis that

You have no other textual basis for doing that,

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, our textual basis is in

19

1821, which is in attendance.

20

QUESTION:

And we can --

But you're then, as I understand it,

21

you're defining in attendance by reference to the process

22

by which the person comes into attendance and that's why

23

you place the emphasis on the need for a subpoena for a

24

defense witness as indicated in 1825.

Yeah, but if 1825 is supposedly

got to face the fact, haven't you, that 1825 only refers

to defense witnesses, by which I assume they mean

witnesses called by the defense, which would lead you to

the conclusion that a prisoner called by the Government

would get paid and a prisoner called by the defense would

not.

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, one example, Justice

White, is the prisoners who aren't convicted.

17

our construction of the statute those persons fall outside

18

the scope of the statute and under the Department of

19

Justice regulation which draws a distinction between in

custody and not, that person would fall out.

21

the Comptroller General drew a distinction between

22

convicted and nonconvicted prisoners and said that if

you're not convicted yet, you're entitled to the fee.

No, Justice Marshall.

You don't say a writ of habeas corpus

They do, but not in the sense

that the — they're not — we don't rely on them as a law

He would not be because the only

It's only been — it's only been

and the practice — if you — the reason why the history

2

is important is the idea of a witness isn't simply the

testimony in court.

parcel of being a witness and we know that because of the

5

idea of attendance.

it brings out the point of the, of the volunteer witness.

everyone else who can be a witness, because he is going to

QUESTION:

Do little children get the witness

Yes, they do.

QUESTION:

Including children who are too young

to work under State law I would assume?
MR. LAZERWITZ:

Yes, including those.

Prisoners, of course, are in a different position.

And in

it makes sense, providing this sort of bonanza to prisoner
