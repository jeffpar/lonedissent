have

determined that you have no standing under article III.
MS. WOODWARD:

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

No.
How do you — how -- what is it that

7

we look to to determine that that's what Congress -- that

8

Congress thought those two categories were co-extensive?

MR. SEAMON:

9

First, let me clarify.

Our position

10

is that officers of agencies is a subset, wholly included

11

within the larger set officers of the United States.

12

QUESTION:

Oh, all right.

You're right.

I see.

13

But that everyone in that subset would be an officer of the

14

United States?

15

MR. SEAMON:

16

QUESTION:

17

Yes, that's correct.
Is that — is that point plain from

the meaning -- from the text of the statute?

18

MR. SEAMON:

We believe it is among other reasons

19

because subsections (a)(2) through (a)(4) speak in terms of

20

officers of the House and Congress, officers of the court.

21

And as this Court recognized in Mesa v. Arizona, these are
