We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD L. DAY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DAY:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a formerly de jure school

13

system which eliminated unlawful discrimination through

14

sustained good faith compliance with the compulsory

15

desegregation decree and then 8 years subsequent to the

16

achievement of unitary status was persuaded by intervening

17

demographic forces and legitimate educational

18

considerations to curtail compulsory busing in grades 1

19

through 4 only and reassign those pupils to their

20

neighborhood schools.

21

Because there are neighborhoods in Oklahoma City

22

which are not integrated, 11 of 64 elementary schools at

23

that time became predominantly black.

24

challenged the racial disproportionate impact of the plan,

25

and this chapter of the litigation was opened.

This case presents what is perhaps the most

1
2

important unresolved question in the area of

3

desegregation; that is, what is the effect of a binding

4

declaration that a formerly de jure school system has

5

achieved unitary status.
QUESTION:

6
7
8
9

Mr. Day, how do you define unitary

status?
MR. DAY:

I define unitary status, Justice

Blackmun, as the Court did, the unanimous Court in Swann

10

and Spangler; that is, it's a school district that has

11

dismantled the dual school system and eliminated unlawful

12

discrimination, including the vestiges of unlawful

13

discrimination, to the extent practical.

14

QUESTION:

15

meant when it used that term?

16

MR. DAY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DAY:

Do you think that's what the Court

Yes, sir, I do.
No question about it?
No question about it, because the '77

19

record demonstrates, Justice Blackmun, that respondents'

20

attorney or plaintiffs' attorney took the position at that

21

time that jurisdiction could not be relinquished until all

22

the vestiges of discrimination had been eliminated, and of

23

course, the district court did relinquish jurisdiction.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Day, did the district court in

1977 assume that the plan would remain in effect in making

2

its unitariness binding?
MR. DAY:

I believe in 1977 Judge Bohanon did

3

comment that he did not foresee that his order would

4

result in the dismantlement of the plan.

5

not believe that that was an order which had the effect of

6

compelling the board to continue to follow the plan.

7

For example —

QUESTION:

9
10
11

However, I do

Well, do you think that a school

district reaches that unitary status as soon as the
desegregation plan is in effect?
MR. DAY:

No.

No, Justice O'Connor.

Although

12

a -- the implementation of a plan will create a

13

race-neutral method of student assignment, Green clearly

14

indicates that there must be a period of good faith and

15

sustained compliance, and I do believe that's necessary.

16

In Oklahoma City we had 13 years of that.

17

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that in 1978, for

18

example, in this case that the school distinct would have

19

been free to reintroduce neighborhood schools?

20
21

MR. DAY:

It is our position that the

finding of Unitarian —

As of that time?
Yes.

that existed when the lawsuit began so many years ago; is

2

that right?

3
4
5

MR. DAY:

No, I believe that's incorrect,

Justice O'Connor.
First of all, the unitary finding represents

6

that the dual school system has been dismantled and that

7

the vestiges of elimination have been eliminated.

8

9
10
11

I would point out that in 1985 Judge Bohanon
expressed no surprise when the board did change the plan,
and that his intent is reflected through that order.
I would also point out that when this case was

12

filed in 1961 we had a true dual system, and all six of

13

the Green factors were discriminatory in Oklahoma City.

14

Presently, the only similarity is the composition of the

15

student body, and this Court has repeatedly stated that

16

the Constitution does not guarantee any particular degree

17

of racial balance or mixing.

18

QUESTION:

I take it that part of the definition

19

of a unitary system is a plan that's operated over some

20

period of time in the unitary status, is it not?

21

something that's either achieved or not achieved at one

22

particular moment that we can —

the students?

2

MR. DAY:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes, it does.

In --

So this case is in part about

perceptions?
MR. DAY:

5

Yes, it is. , In Keys* the Court stated

6

that the attitudes of administrators and members of the

7

community are relevant in determining if segregation has

8

been eliminated, so that's precisely correct.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Day, may I ask you — I'm sorry,

10

did I -- may I ask you a question about -- that always

11

puzzled me about this case?
As I understand it, at the time the district

12

13

judge made the finding of unitariness, he did not vacate

14

the outstanding decree?

15

MR. DAY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DAY:

QUESTION:

MR. DAY:

Was the school board, therefore,

still bound by the decree?

That is correct.

Stevens.

It is our position that they were not.
That he in effect vacated the decree?
That that was his intent, yes, Justice

We -QUESTION:

Well, but if the decree had remained

23

in effect, it is clear, is it not, that the return to

24

neighborhood schools for the younger children was a

25

violation of the decree?

MR. DAY:

1

Yes, that would be correct.

However,

2

I would hasten to point out that on an evidentiary-

3

hearing, there could be circumstances where that decree

4

could be modified —
QUESTION:

5

I understand, and it had a provision

6

in it to go in and ask for a modification.

7

said in so many words, as I understand it, that you will

8

not deviate from whatever the name of the plan was without

9

the prior approval of the court?

10

MR. DAY:

11

QUESTION:

12

But it also

Yes.
So that one of the questions, I

guess, is whether the decree was still in effect?

13

MR. DAY:

14

First, I believe that language was intended to

15

apply to the board during the remedial phase of the case

16

when unitary status was being achieved.

17

QUESTION:

Well, we do not believe it was.

Well, it doesn't say that, though.

18

It just says it does not have a termination point within

19

the terms of the decree itself.

20

MR. DAY:

That's correct.

May I also state that

21

our position is based on the rationale adopted by the

22

Fourth Circuit in Riddick and the Fifth Circuit in

23

Overton.

24
25

In each of those cases, unitary status, coupled
with court disengagement, was found sufficient to return

1

total control to the board, and in neither of those cases

2

did the district court dissolve the decree.
Those jurisdictions believed that the

3
4

achievement of unitary status coupled with court

5

disengagement has the effect of rendering the decree

6

inoperable, and that is the — that is the understanding

7

of the Oklahoma City Board when they implemented this

8

plan.

9

that time.

It was also the understanding of Judge Bohanon at

QUESTION:

10
11

Do you know why he didn't go ahead

and vacate the decree when he made the finding?

12

MR. DAY:

I don't believe he thought it was

13

necessary.

14

both 1985 and 1987 that when he found the district unitary

15

in 1977 he certainly intended to return full control to

16

the board of education at that time.

17

question about that, and he certainly intended to say that

18

this district was, indeed, a true unitary district which

19

had dismantled the dual system and eliminated the vestiges

20

of discrimination.

21

In a subsequent opinion, he did state that in

QUESTION:

There was no

But does the fact that the schools

22

became identifiably — or would become identifiably black

23

in some neighborhoods under the student reassignment

plan — does that mean that the Finger Plan didn't work?

MR. DAY:

No.

is the fact that there are certain neighborhoods that are

2

not integrated, does that mean the Finger Plan didn't

3

work?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DAY:

Yes.
No, I don't think so.

The fact that

6

certain neighborhoods in Oklahoma City are not integrated

7

is as a result of a phenomenon over which this board of

8

education, and no board of education, has control.

9

speaking of a condition of residential segregation.

10

QUESTION:

We're

Well, there was a finding in an

11

earlier decree, wasn't there, that residential segregation

12

was in part caused by the de jure violation?

13

MR. DAY:

I don't believe that is correct,

14

Justice Kennedy.

15

when the neighborhood school policy was superimposed over

16

nonintegrated neighborhoods, coupled with the illegal

17

minority-to-majority transfer policy, that this had the

18

effect in some cases of creating schools which were

19

segregated, not neighborhoods.

20

What Judge Bohanon did find was that

In fact, Judge Bohanon, in 1970, in an opinion,

21

clearly stated that the Oklahoma City Board of Education

22

had done nothing to cause or contribute to residential

23

segregation in Oklahoma City.

24
25

The issue presented by this case is perhaps the
most important unresolved question in the area of

desegregation law.

2

binding declaration that a formerly de jure school system

3

has achieved unitary status?

4

That is, what is the effect of a

According to respondents, it means very little,

5

if anything, for in their view a unitary school district

6

is obligated to continue to labor under the governance of

7

a desegregation decree and maintain racial balance until

8

all the neighborhoods in a community are unitary.

9

Based on fundamental principles previously

10

announced by this Court in the desegregation context, we

11

believe that unitarianist must mean that the

12

constitutional violation has been eliminated, and

13

therefore control over the schools should be returned to

14

the board of education.

15

We believe that it means the desegregation

16

decree should be lifted, and at that time the school board

17

should be returned to the same status as any other school

18

board, thereby being governed by traditional equal

19

protection principles.

20

Now, the unitarianist finding in Oklahoma City

21

came 16 years after this suit was filed.

22

case was filed in 1961, and the school board first used

23

busing as an aid to integration in 1965, it was not until

24

1 year after Swann that a comprehensive plan was

25

implemented.

Although the

1

In 1972, Judge Bohanon ordered the school board

2

to implement the Finger Plan, which employed the

3

techniques of pairing, clustering, and massive cross-town

4

busing to integrate all the schools in Oklahoma City.
The board of education appealed that order, and

5
6

the circuit affirmed.

7

Spangler, it became the law of this case that the Finger

8

Plan constituted a race-neutral and constitutional method

9

of pupil assignment.

Thus, under the rationale of

In 1977, Judge Bohanon, pursuant to a motion by

10
11

the board, entered his order terminating the case.

That

12

order did find that the school district had achieved

13

unitariness after 16 years and terminated all further

14

jurisdiction in the case.

15

QUESTION:

May I question the — I'm sorry.

16

You mentioned the timing going back to '61, but

17

is it not true that in '72, when he imposed the plan, he

18

found that up until that date the board had been

19

recalcitrant and deliberately refused to carry out the

20

mandate of desegregation, so isn't the relevant period

21

from 1972 to 1977?

Third,

Now, Judge Bohanon acknowledged that in the

10

1960's, as you pointed out, Justice Stevens, this board

11

was recalcitrant, and he butted heads with the board.

12

in his recent decisions he has clearly pointed out that

13

the present board of education, and the board that was in

14

power when his plan was implemented, was a totally

15

different board with totally different attitudes.

His findings must be given due deference.

I would also point out that Judge Bohanon noted

21

that in Oklahoma City the manner in which pupils are

22

assigned to schools is no longer determined by race.

23

Rather, it's determined on the race-neutral method of

24

where the children live, and Judge Bohanon felt that it

25

was very important that this school board had implemented

1

a transfer policy -- it's called a majority-to-minority

2

transfer policy — which allowed any student in a school

3

which was racially identifiable to transfer to a school

4

which was more integrated, and the School District picks

5

up the cost of transportation in those circumstances.
So today, in Oklahoma City, no child is

6
7

compelled to attend school by virtue of race, and the

8

important thing today is that parents of all races have a

9

choice.

10

Judge Bohanon also found that the school board

11

had maintained its unitary status from 1977 to date.

12

this case, we had three findings of unitariness:

13

1977, one in 1985, and another in 1987, all made by

14

Judge Bohanon based on the circumstances in Oklahoma City.

unlawful discrimination has been eliminated and the

2

vestiges have been eliminated to the extent practical.

3

That was the standard set forth in the Alexander case.

4

We also believe that, since the remedy must be

5

related to the constitutional violation, that a district

court is obligated in the first instance, when it

7

formulates the decree, to identify the vestiges so they

may be eradicated.

you're using the word segregate in an unusual sense.

No.

QUESTION:

In other words, you think there must

MR. CHAMBERS:

I think there must be some

pairing and clustering with the schools, with

transportation provided if that is necessary, in order to

13

accommodate desegregation or the maintenance of

14

desegregation of these elementary schools.

we're talking not just about the 40 percent of the black

we have a substantial number of students in the system now

Your Honor, it's clear — no, it

Oklahoma City clearly had State law requiring

segregation of students.
QUESTION:

Well, the argument is, of course,

that — is that official segregation is a thing of the

that however you define unitary you should not permit
