ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. SHOEMAKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

We are here on a case determining the validity

of a Missouri mandatory retirement provisions — provision

21

age for those judges violates the equal protection

22

guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

The issues that we have briefed

One is whether to those judges in Missouri who

Discrimination in Employment Act because the act exempts

2

appointees at the policy-making level, and the court held

3

that judges in Missouri are policy makers, and hence not

covered by the act.

5

The Eighth Circuit also ruled that there was a

6

rational basis for the mandatory retirement of all judges,

and hence did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

QUESTION:

The district court — the court of

appeals accepted the district court's finding that the
judges were not elected officials in Missouri, did it not?
MR. SHOEMAKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, the Eighth

12

Circuit accepted that proposition, but I must say in

13

fairness there was a sentence which indicated if that

14

issue had been briefed in the Eighth Circuit, the Eighth

15

Circuit might have disagreed with that finding.

QUESTION:

MR. SHOEMAKE:

Come out differently.
But the district court did find

that the appointed judges were not elected to office, they

would have wanted to exclude from the ADEA elected judges

but not appointed judges?

voters to determine the motive or (inaudible) intention of
the elected — the voters as to what motives they may have
had in voting for elected officials, whether those elected
officials were judges or Governors or legislators.
QUESTION:

Well, now, Missouri selects its
*

judges pursuant to constitutional provisions in the State
of Missouri?
MR. SHOEMAKE:
QUESTION:

The — that is correct.

State constitutional provisions.

MR. SHOEMAKE:

That is correct, Justice

O'Connor, but —
QUESTION:

And you think it's sufficiently clear

that Congress intended to override these State
constitutional provisions without ever making clear that
intent?
MR. SHOEMAKE:

I think it is clear that the

Congress intended that the ADA be construed broadly and
that the exceptions be narrowly construed.

And I think

that when the ADA was enacted there were 30 States
approximately that appointed judges, and that those
Congressmen and those Senators who voted for that ADA were
fully aware that it may cover the judges.

There is

nothing in the legislative history of the ADA itself which
indicates whether the Congress intended or didn't intend
to include or exclude the judges.

QUESTION:

are dealing here with a preemption of a State

3

constitutional provision of this significance to the

4

State, that we should look for a clear expression of

5

intent by Congress, not something that just appears never

6

to have even been considered?

7

✓

Well, don't you think that when we

MR. SHOEMAKE:

I believe, Justice O'Connor,

8

there has been such clear intent or expression by the

9

Congress, because when the act was amended in 1974 it was

10

amended to specifically apply to States and political

11

subdivisions as employers.

12

view, the State of Missouri is an employer hence covered

13

by the act, and that a judge is an employee and hence

14

covered by the protections guaranteed by the ADEA.

15

QUESTION:

And that would be, in our

I thought Justice O'Connor's question

16

was addressed not to whether the State was covered as an

17

employer, which it obviously is under, certainly we upheld

18

that in EEOC against Wyoming, but whether the statute, in

19

view of the proviso, should be found to reach State court

judges.

should be read to reach State court judges.

In Missouri we have two selection processes for

the judges.

The supreme court and the court of appeals

There is a greater

Why is that distinction made, do you

think, Mr. Shoemake?

18

MR. SHOEMAKE:

The — the language when the

19

Missouri Plan was adopted initially applied to only the

20

supreme court and the appellate judges, and the purpose

21

was to remove partisan politics from the selection of

22

judges.

23

that same process for selection to the City of St. Louis

24

and Kansas City, then later to St. Louis County, which is

25

a contiguous county to the City of St. Louis.

And then there was later an amendment to provide

And there was some — the suggestion is there

was some resistance in the rural area where people wanted

3

their judges to be elected and run for election.

And on the election process -- I'm getting a

in primaries just like any other candidate and then they

run in the general election.

MR. SHOEMAKE:

of them been appointed?

No, these judges have been retained.

But — in Missouri, under the Missouri Non-Partisan Court

who was an elected judge, was grandfathered in, and when
it was time for retention he was not retained.

But those

who have been appointed, there is not a single incidence
of any of those judges who have not been retained in
office.
We submit that to understand and appreciate the
intent of the Congress in enacting the ADEA, it's best to
look at the legislative history and the discussions that
went on in the amendment to title VII of the Civil Rights
Act, which contains the same language and the same
exemptions about elected officials and so forth.

In that

it was clear that what the Congress was intending was to
exempt an elected official and that elected official's
team, his personal staff, his legal advisors, those who
made policy for him.

In fact the example is such as

Cabinet officers and persons with comparable
responsibilities in talking about policy making.
QUESTION:

I was intrigued by that theory.

That

would mean that if you have at the State level the
equivalent of independent regulatory agencies that we have
at the Federal level, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Federal Communications Commissions, and so forth, whose
people are not Cabinet officers.

They are not part of the

supposed to be independent.

In fact —
QUESTION:

Now why, why would they make that

kind of a distinction?
MR. SHOEMAKE:

That seemed to me very strange.
Well, because they wanted that

going to serve him and generate the policy that he stands

for, or attempt to, for which he was elected, to be able

perhaps, for the application of a clear statement because

However, what we have done is create a

But at the end of the term there is a price to
be paid.

And that is the price that the voters of

Missouri in 1970 enacted overwhelmingly, and I think based
upon experience in the State of Missouri, that a mandatory
retirement age guarantees that the benefits of this super­
incumbency will not carry on forever, that it will end,
and that the benefits of being able to move new people
into the system, into the judiciary, will be obtained
through an orderly attrition created by mandatory
retirement.
