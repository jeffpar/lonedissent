QUESTION:

Mr. Travis, I am curious to know how

far your argument takes.

Assume a case in which the final

10

jury that is selected is proportional to the community, so

11

there is no Sixth Amendment claim.

12

finds out that the prosecutor has deliberately, during the

13

entire prior 6 months including the selection of his own

14

jury, followed a deliberate policy of taking as few blacks

15

as he could get away with.

16

or they coded them or something.

17

to keep the number of blacks who get into the venires down.

18

Would the white defendant have any equal protection basis

19

for challenging that practice?
