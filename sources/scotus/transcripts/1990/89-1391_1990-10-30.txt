ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We depend upon our doctors to tell us the whole

12

truth, whoever is paying the medical bill -- the patient

13

or the government, whether in a Title X clinic or in the

14

Bethesda Naval Hospital.

15

confirms a condition that we had worried about, we all, I

16

think, rely on the doctor to level with us in a discussion

17

that follows the diagnosis.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Especially when a medical test

Are doctors always involved in Title X

programs?
MR. TRIBE:

They supervise, Justice Kennedy.

They

21

are not always the personal counselor, but under the Title

22

X regulations they are responsible for supervision.

23

the health care professionals to whom women speak, whether

24

doctors or not, are ones that I think one would trust to

25

tell one the truth.

And

And if the government were to play a

1

role in the picture I think we would assume that its role

2

is to make sure that nothing relevant is left out.

3

But if any of us were to discover that the government

4

instead had arranged to have the doctor or the health care

5

professional omit all information about one legally-

6

available medical option and give you a referral list that

7

is clearly tilted in the direction of the other option,

8

regardless of what dangers there might be to your health,

9

I would suppose that most of us would conclude that the

10

government had used its bargaining power to betray a

11

rather basic trust.

12

Its contract with the doctor, if that really were a

13

fair description of the situation, would violate its more

14

fundamental contract with all of us, including the First

15

and Fifth Amendments.

16

By conditioning Title X grants on the regulations

17

that we challenge in this case, the government, in the

18

words of Judge Cardamone, concurring below, sets a trap

19

for the unwary.

20

these regulations not even the petitioners' private funds,

21

sometimes in excess of three times the size of the Federal

22

grant, may be used to provide uncensored medical

23

information to the patients enrolled in the petitioners'

24

Title X family planning clinics.

25

QUESTION:

The reason, quite simply, is that under

1

the case, so long as those funds are not used in the Title

2

X program.

3

Federal money?

4

The Title X program, by the way, is how much

MR. TRIBE:

It's at least 90 percent, is it?
Well, actually, Justice Scalia, the

5

regulation makes reference to a 90-10 ratio, but, as the

6

counsel for the Secretary explicitly conceded in oral

7

argument in the First Circuit at footnote 59 of the

8

Planned Parenthood brief, it's been a very long time since

9

they have made any effort to live up with that.

10

The reason has been that as Federal funds have

11

diminished and as the government, I think quite

12

understandably, has not wanted to penalize clinics for

13

growing, the norm now is that the Title X program project,

14

as defined under 59.2 of the regs, is typically funded at

15

a level of 50 percent or less, as the Secretary conceded

16

in the First Circuit, of the Federal funds.

17

So that, for example, in the case of the clinics in

18

this case, in Westchester-Rockland it's about 23 percent,

19

in the case of the City of New York it's about 50.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. TRIBE:

Where is the 90-10 pulled from?
The 90-10 does have, actually, a

22

statutory origin, and there is some confusion, I

23

understand, about whether the statute has been properly

24

construed by the Secretary of HHS in allowing the reach of

25

the Federal hand to exceed this 10 percent Federal fisk.

1

But, in any event, there's no dispute that the entire

2

program — the family planning program at the Hub in the

3

Bronx, the family planning program, including, as the regs

4

call it, the comprehensive coherent set of plans and

5

program -- including the private money, is encumbered by

6

these regulations.

7

QUESTION:

I suppose we ought to evaluate the Federal

8

statute and the regulations under the Federal statute on

9

the basis of what Congress contemplated when it passed it,

10

and Congress appears to have contemplated a program that

11

is at least 90 percent Federal money.

12

MR. TRIBE:

That has been argued in various courts.

13

It is still not resolved.

14

argument is completely independent of whether the private

15

funds are 10 percent or 50 percent, because we will be

16

arguing that in this case the regulations are sufficiently

17

viewpoint-based that it would not be permissible for the

18

government to impose them, even as a condition of

19

expending its own funds.

20

I would say that much of our

But when I reach that point, Justice Scalia, I think

21

I will be adding a couple of thoughts about the way in

22

which those arguments relate.

23

The government actually claims no general authority,

24

even with its own money, to trick patients about their

25

medical situation after they have come to trust a doctor

1

in a government-assisted clinic, and they certainly don't

2

affirmatively claim that with respect to private funds

3

they have the power to do that.

4

Their basic claim is quite different.

Their claim is

5

that once the client is diagnosed as pregnant the Title X

6

program, the provision of services, is over, so that the

7

further discussion that might be had about abortion is

8

simply outside the scope of the program.

9

fairest way to respond to that is simply to say that it

10
11

I think the

just is not the case.
Much of section 59.8 of the regulations is expressly

12

directed to post-conception services, with only abortion

13

counseling and referral banned.

14

kind of information that a Title X client must be given

15

once pregnancy is diagnosed, and indeed under the original

16

version of the regulations it had said, and I quote,

17

medical services or counseling after pregnancy is

18

diagnosed" would be allowed.

19

QUESTION:

The section details the

"no

Certainly the government in its brief, Mr.

20

Tribe, and perhaps it is wrong, seems to take the position

21

that this is basically a pre-pregnancy counseling program.

22

MR. TRIBE:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

disagree with that.

24

QUESTION:

We think that's incorrect.

You say that that was not what Congress

intended, or that's not what has happened in fact?

1

MR. TRIBE:

I think neither.

That is, President

2

Bush, when a Member of Congress, was one of the leading

3

co-sponsors of this law, and he said that the health care

4

service mechanism that he had in mind was not just a

5

population control mechanism.

6

physical examination, and the regulations themselves have

7

contemplated and the statute has said from the beginning

8

that one must provide more than just a kind of pregnancy

9

kit and see you later.

It should include an annual

10

And indeed the original version was objected to on

11

the dramatic ground that it would permit no "counseling

12

which discourages abortion."

13

53 Federal Register 2926 that that is why the current

14

version does not contain any language suggesting that the

15

program finishes when pregnancy is diagnosed.

16

The Secretary explained at

The aim was put very clearly in 52 Federal Register

17

at 33.2.12, and I quote:

18

this is the purpose of the regulations about how the

19

dialogue after diagnosis is to proceed -- "is to ensure

20

Title X projects do not provide counseling relating to the

21

issue of medical indication for abortion."

22

express purpose.

23

QUESTION:

"The express purpose"

1

programs where abortion is a method of family planning,

2

and since you say that the program doesn't just authorize

3

family planning but authorizes medical treatment after a

4

woman is pregnant, then there really is no prohibition

5

even on the conduct of abortion.

6

9

MR. TRIBE:

No, Justice Scalia.

I am sorry.

If I

left that impression, I surely did not mean to.
QUESTION:

Well, it's where your argument leads.

I

mean, it seems to me you are painting with a very broad

10

brush when you say that the program is not just a program

11

of family planning.

12

MR. TRIBE:

No, I didn't say that, Justice Scalia.

13

The concept of family planning under the program is a

14

somewhat broader concept than would be suggested by a kind

15

of truck stop pregnancy test.

16

women are enrolled throughout their reproductive lives.

17

When they are diagnosed as pregnant, the statute and the

18

regulations in fact do not authorize the provision to

19

these women of the gynecological, obstetrical, prenatal

20

and other services that they might need.

21

That is, many of these

But the idea is that an important part of the program

22

is not simply to put them out on the street without

23

advice, without information.

24

a discussion with them about the options available, and in

25

that discussion the regulations are quite clear in

It is at that point to have

1

specifically prohibiting even neutral discussion about one

2

option, namely abortion, and at the same time mandating

3

with respect to the other option in this mutually-

4

exclusive pair of medical choices, mandating the provision

5

of a prenatal list, a list of prenatal care centers, which

6

under the regulations must include all prenatal care

7

providers in the area, must exclude all clinics

8

specializing in abortion, and must be limited to clinics

9

that are committed to the welfare both of the unborn child

10
11

and of the mother.
So that the message, quite plainly, of your doctor

12

handing you, after a pregnancy diagnosis, a list of this

13

sort and saying this is a list of places that will be

14

concerned with you welfare and that of the unborn child is

15

basically that your welfare is not endangered by the birth

16

of the child, and the implicit message is that abortion

17

needn't concern you.

18

may be told that the project does not consider abortion an

19

appropriate method of family planning.

20
21

And, indeed, if the woman asks she

So this is all quite obviously reassuring, but it is
not a —

MR. TRIBE:

No, they are not, Justice White.

That

is, what would be steering and referral in clear violation

of the regulations.

be allowed to hand the woman a copy of the regulations, I

5

suppose, although that might be said to be handing her

6

material that could be encouraging of abortion.

7

hope not.

8
9

They are allowed to say — they would

I would

If they hand her that list — that is, the
information on how the list is composed — she will

10

understand that by coincidence there might be some

11

abortion providers in the area, but even if they include a

12

hospital which might, for example, provide abortion, the

13

Federal Register 53 at page 29.38 says that the referral

14

must be specifically made to its prenatal care service.

15

So that if the woman finds the needle in the haystack it's

16

not going to be by the government's design.

17

Indeed, the Secretary, below, said it was designed to

18

have no loopholes.

And, when asked below whether the

19

woman could be told that maybe under A in the Yellow Pages

20

she would find something that could be relevant to her,

21

the government said no.

22

said that that would probably be, in their view,

23

impermissible.

And two of the three judges below

So this is not a neutral —

arguing that the regulations are inconsistent with the

MR. TRIBE:

We'd be entirely happy to have you say

(Laughter.)

21

MR. TRIBE:

But I think the point is that it's partly

22

because of the constitutional doubt about these

regulations that we would not suggest that the normal

rules of Chevron in deferring to the HHS are appropriate.

25

And because of that we would suggest that if the

1

constitutional cloud seems sufficiently ominous one might

2

simply read the statute the way the Secretary himself read

3

it for the first 11 years, simply to permit options to be

4

presented to the woman and perhaps the way it's been read

5

since '81, namely to require the neutral provision of

6

options, but not the way these regs read it.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, do you concede that the way the

Secretary originally interpreted it is constitutional?
MR. TRIBE:

We think in respect to that, Justice

10

O'Connor, that permitting options to be presented is

11

surely constitutional.

12

-- we were never in a position to challenge it because the

13

clients that I represent, the City, the State of New York,

14

and the various clinics do not themselves engage in

15

encouraging or promoting abortion — but insofar as that

16

was a viewpoint-based limitation I suppose an argument

17

could be made that that part was not constitutional.

18

The part where I am not as certain

We do not make that argument here.

We do argue that

19

when in respect to a binary choice about one's medical

20

fate the government suppresses talk about one branch, even

21

neutral talk, and mandates steering in the other

22

direction, that that is the impermissible suppression of

23

information.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. TRIBE:

And why is that unconstitutional?
Because, I guess, as Justice Rehnquist
13

said in his concurring opinion in Bolger v. Youngs Drug,

2

the central purpose of the First Amendment is to prevent

3

the suppression of information.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. TRIBE:

6

QUESTION:

So this is a First Amendment argument?
It's strictly a First Amendment argument.
But is it peculiar to the medical

7

situation here?

8

talking about the Secretary of State hiring a press or

public information officer or the press secretary at the

Because certainly if the government is

10

White House, the press secretary or the public information

11

officer are not free to say look, I want to tell the

reporters everything I know, if the Secretary of State

says you play this down.

I think they'll soon learn.

18

21

Some of them don't seem to realize that.

That's right.
Would you agree that is not

unconstitutional?
MR. TRIBE:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

23

difference — it's not peculiar to the medical profession.

24

The real difference is that some people serve as

25

mouthpieces for the state — speechwriters, spokespersons;

other people serve as professionals in whom people place

2

their trust.

That's at the other end of the spectrum.

3

And we suggest --

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. TRIBE:

I didn't quite mean it that way.

The

6

point really is that the people in Title X clinics look

7

like doctors.

They are dressed like doctors.

8

like doctors.

And, therefore, when they try to speak like

9

doctors the fact that the government has selectively

They act

10

shaped their speech has First Amendment significance that

11

it wouldn't have if everyone looked at them and said,

12

these are the Solicitor — I didn't mean the Solicitor

13

General —

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. TRIBE:

The Surgeon General of the United States.

In other words, these are not the Voice of America.

are the voice of medical professionals.

QUESTION:

These

You don't challenge the statute, though,

do you?
MR. TRIBE:

No.

We think the statute would be

21

unconstitutional only if it were written specifically to

authorize these regulations; otherwise, excluding abortion

23

from this funding I think is clearly permissible under

Harris and under McRae.

interpretation, the one that you would like us to in

2

effect go back to, suppose this medical care professional

3

said, in our view, from your standpoint and your family

4

situation, abortion is the recommended choice for family

5

planning, and we urge you to have an abortion and here is

6

the name of a place where you can obtain that.

7

Is that consistent with the statute?

8

MR. TRIBEj

9

I think not, Justice Kennedy.

It seems

to me that this statute is most plausibly implemented by

10

maximizing the autonomy of the patient and by steering the

11

patient in neither direction but by suppressing

12

information in either direction.

13

That is, I would think that the most obviously

14

constitutional way to implement it is to permit, as the

15

Secretary did until 1981, or to require, as the Secretary

16

did from 1981, the provision of a neutral set of options

17

so that the person can make an intelligent choice.

18

Justice White I think —

19

QUESTION:

20
21

So that it's wrong to make a

recommendation under the First Amendment?
MR. TRIBE:

It's not wrong to make a recommendation.

22

It is, however, consistent with a program designed to

23

provide information and not designed to steer people

24

toward any choice to insist that the professional stand

25

back and play a more passive role.

Total viewpoint neutrality in this area I

have to concede is difficult to achieve because the very

fact that these are professionals and that laws of

informed consent surround this area means that they can be

11

required to provide information without which an informed

choice can't be made.

look to for these matters.

There are, in addition to that, some 590,000 women

not, that these conditions can sometimes be induced to

Well, the Secretary's official

explanation of the regulations said that they were

designed to prevent any expression of medical indication

3

imminent threat to life they cannot refer her to someone

4

who might do an abortion, but to an emergency room.

5

But the reference to abortion as a method of family

think have no meaning under the government's reading of

in the statute that would even prevent the use of Federal

there is no easy way to figure out where to draw that

important in terms of the orderliness of the procedure.

There was a notice and comment rulemaking here which

was responsive to the very kinds of concerns that had been

identified by the General Accounting Office.

say the Secretary, among other things, had proceeded in a

very informal way.

That is to

There had never been regulations.

the like.

19

that non-directive counseling could in fact be consistent

with the mandate, as those early memos, if you look at our

footnote 3, the Carol Conrad memorandum said very clearly

22

that promotion and encouragement of abortion is forbidden.

But could the Secretary have taken the

position of that earlier response and been within the
meaning of the statute?
MR. STARR:

I think that's problematic.

I have,

frankly, serious doubts that the Secretary could have, but

I don't think we have to resolve that definitively here,

a list of available providers that promote the welfare of

4

the mother and the unborn child.

5

Is that provision authorized by the statute?

MR. STARR:

Yes, I think so.

The Secretary has long

7

felt that the program must be administered in a humane,

8

compassionate way that in fact attends to the health needs

9

of the individual and to refer that person to an

10
11

appropriate provider of medical care.

So the statute does require some post­

pregnancy counseling?

In the sense of transition, transitional

18

QUESTION:

Never mind the regulation.

Where does the

statute require that or authorize that, for that matter?
MR. STARR:

I don't think it requires it.

I think

19

that the Secretary, in his discretion, has determined that

20

as a matter of common sense interpretation there must be a

21

transition out of Title X to protect -- in essence to

22

maintain the status quo until the referral appointment can

23

be kept.

General, what do you say the statute and

simply to preserve the status quo but the situation in

which the Title X physician in the course of his

consulting or examination concludes that the mother is

pregnant and in fact is in some imminent danger to health?

8

In that case, do you take the position that either

the statute or the regs permit the Title X physician to

10

say you are in danger to health as a result of your

pregnancy and one appropriate response to that would be to

have an abortion and I will refer you to a hospital or a

MR. STARR:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because at

2

that point the person, the physician in your hypothetical

3

-- I think it is an extreme hypothetical, but accepting it

4

and facing it -- I think in that hypothetical the

5

physician has transcended the boundaries of Title X.

6

His Title X hat, family planning services, is on.

7

Once he steps out of that hat and begins treating the

8

individual's pregnancy, he is providing a different kind

9

of medical care beyond the scope of Title X, quite apart

10

from abortion.

11

QUESTION:

The Secretary requires him to do that, as

12

Justice Stevens' question earlier demonstrated.

it's the Secretary that says you have to provide this kind

of medical care in the regs.

in those circumstances — to be sure that is not what

Title X was concerned with, but in those circumstances —

4

the physician cannot perform a normal professional

5

responsibility which is outside of the object of Title X

6

funding, even though that responsibility does not violate

7

the prohibition against using abortion counseling for

8

family planning.

9

I think you are telling us that in that circumstance,

10

simply because it is outside the object of Title X, the

11

Secretary in effect may preclude professional speech.

12

MR. STARR:

I don't think that the program is

13

prescribing professional speech, if I accept your

14

hypothetical as not in fact permitting what the Secretary

15

contemplated to take place.

16

contemplated — that in cases in which emergency care is

required — that's, I think, what we are dealing with — a

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

May I expand on that?

Supposing the case

4

is not one of emergency at the time of the conference but

5

in the doctor's professional judgment unless steps are

6

taken within 30 days there is a danger of an emergency,

7

and he thinks the appropriate way of avoiding that danger

8

is to at least consider abortion as an option.

9
10
11
12

What is he supposed to do under the regulations?
MR. STARR:

I'm sorry.

I missed the last part of the

hypothetical.
QUESTION:

What is the doctor's -- how much freedom

13

does the doctor have to explain to the patient that in the

14

next 30 days you ought to have some tests to see whether

15

or not it's appropriate to have an abortion, because that

16

may be the only way to avoid a risk that is not today an

17

emergency but may become an emergency in three weeks?

18

MR. STARR:

I think that the physician is at liberty

19

to provide medical information that is necessary, and so I

20

think that the physician in that hypothetical could

21

respond, provide that physician's best medical judgment,

22

as long as the physician does not in fact steer the

23

patient in the direction of an abortion, but, rather,

24

steers the patient in the direction of an appropriate care

25

provider.

QUESTION:

Well, but may the physician — I don't

part of his or her explanation of the problem, say that

the reason I want you to see some other professional is I

think it may be appropriate to avoid this danger by

getting an abortion?

MR. STARR:

I think that, in my judgment, that goes

beyond what is permitted under Title X.
QUESTION:

1

At that point, the health of and welfare of the

2

mother are paramount, and the physician must in fact make

3

the appropriate referral to an emergency provider.

QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question.

MR. STARR:

Yes.

I think that the physician can in

fact alert the individual to a potential medical problem.
QUESTION:

And suggest the proper solution, in his or

her judgment?

I think at that point the physician may

QUESTION:
