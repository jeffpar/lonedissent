ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN E. ROSENBAUM

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

12
13

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case today is about fair and evenhanded

14

justice for the accuser.

15

to briefly make at the beginning of my argument.

16

I submit there is no independent State ground upon which

17

the lower court decision was predicated.

18

from a reading of the opinion that the sole authority

19

relied upon by the Ohio Supreme Court was this Court's

20

holdings in Booth and Gathers.

I have three points I would like

21

Secondly, the evidence —

22

QUESTION:

Firstly,

It is obvious

May I just interrupt you?

I hate to

23

do this, but you say from reading the opinion.

24

Justice Stewart used to lecture me periodically about the

25

importance of the syllabus in Ohio law.

I remember

Now, what does

1

the syllabus say the holding is?

2

MR. ROSENBAUM:

The syllabus in this case is

3

taken directly from the text of the opinion from Section

4

1(e), and it says expressions of opinion by a witness as

5

to the appropriateness of a particular sentence in a

6

capital case violate the defendant's constitutional right

7

to have the sentencing decision made by the jury and

8

judge.

9

there is constitutional right.

And they argue to the court that the key word
And the only authority,

10

indeed the only constitutional authority cited and relied

11

upon by the Ohio Supreme Court, is Booth and Gathers.

12

in fact, the very next sentence —

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And

But do those cases, do Booth or

Gathers deal with the issue discussed in the syllabus?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

Absolutely.

They deal with the

16

constitutional ramifications which the Ohio Supreme Court

17

felt to comply — to take out the opinion evidence in this

18

case as well as the evidence of harm caused to the victims

19

in general.

20

opinion from that same section says, after reviewing the

21

arguments presented we find no grounds on which to

22

distinguish Booth and Gathers, and we are thus compelled

23

to follow those cases and vacate the sentence of death.

24
25

And I submit that the very next line of the

QUESTION:

Let me just be sure — are you now

reading from the syllabus or the opinion?

MR. ROSENBAUM:

The very next line of the

11

opinion, that is correct.

12

constitutional right is in the syllabus, and that's what

13

we're talking about today, not opinion evidence, but the

14

constitutional ramifications that took out the opinion

15

evidence in this case and also persuaded the Ohio Supreme

16

Court through, I believe, a misinterpretation of Gathers,

17

to say that it is not relevant to a person's moral guilt

18

when he knowingly causes trauma on known victims prior to

19

the time he made his decision of guilt.

20

QUESTION:

But the reference to the

Counsel, on this point, as I recall

21

the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court, it cited no State

22

authority in support of its holding on this — that you

23

have just quoted from the syllabus.

24
25

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Mr. Justice Kennedy, it cited no

other authority other than Booth and Gathers.

I thought it was quite different, a

Well, Mr. Rosenbaum, did either Booth

MR. ROSENBAUM:

In the Bronsteins' statement in

11

the victim impact statement that was this Court's basis,

12

or was construed to be inappropriate by this Court, they

13

make reference to, although they did not express the

14

desire to impose the ultimate penalty, they said that the

15

person was not subject to rehabilitation, that justice

16

should be swift, and they clearly implied what their

17

thinking was, although they did not come out and say that.

18

QUESTION:

It seemed to me that the Ohio

19

syllabus here was focusing on a somewhat different point,

20

to whit, the recommendation of the penalty and nothing

21

more.

22

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I think the syllabus clearly

23

points out that what is important here is the

constitutional right, and I think the constitutional

rights involved, and whether there is a prohibition based

as to the ultimate issue, as opposed to the other kinds of

this trial?

QUESTION:

I cannot make —

Can we speculate on why that might

be?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

I am reluctant to speculate, but

17

I can respond to your question by saying in Chief Justice

18

Moyer's concurring opinion he made it very clear that this

19

ruling came from their concerns about Booth and Gathers,

20

and that they asked — that he felt this was a very

21

confusing case, and he asked for this Court to review it

and revisit it.

tell you that this case is more — is about far more than

QUESTION:

As a matter of State law in Ohio is

opinion evidence on the penalty in a criminal case

admissible as a matter of Ohio law?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

I — this is a point that has

been raised by the respondent, and they cite the case of

State v. White.

their argument is this.

Well, you can just answer the

question.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

I will, thank you.

The answer

12

is it does in the guilt phase, and that is what White

13

deals with.

14

obviously, way before Ohio's bifurcated capital death

In determining whether a defendant is

Not considered relevant.
It is not considered relevant,

Are there Ohio cases holding that lay

MR. ROSENBAUM:

QUESTION:

7

MR. ROSENBAUM:

8

QUESTION:

9

No.

Thank you.
There are not.

Mr. Rosenbaum, when the Supreme Court

of Ohio decided this case and said that the testimony of

10

the lay witness was not admissible, did it rely on any

11

Ohio cases to say that or did it rely on the United States

12

Constitution?

13

MR. ROSENBAUM:

It relied solely upon this

14

Court's interpretations of the Eighth Amendment based on

15

Booth and Gathers.

16

that and this Court's holding in Caldwell v. Mississippi,

17

that this Court should not assume that a State court

18

decision rests on adequate independent State grounds when

19

the State court decision fairly appears to rest primarily

20

on Federal law or even to be interwoven with Federal law.

21

In this case the Ohio Supreme Court expressly relied

22

primarily on Booth and Gathers to reach its decision,

23

which is encapsulated in the syllabus.

thought that Booth and Gathers were so far different that

2

even the dissenting justices' opinions in Booth and

3

Gathers would not have applied to this case.

4

I read them as saying in so many words.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

5

You read the majority of the

Ohio opinion as saying that?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ROSENBAUM:

9

Yes, at page 21.
I — I think that this Court has

wrongfully applied Booth and Gathers on page 21.

I mean,

10

of the — the Ohio Supreme Court has wrongfully applied

11

this Court's holding in Gathers on that page in this case.

But, as I say, they're talking about

13

the position of the dissenters in Booth and Gathers in

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Correct.

But we could perfectly well affirm

without doing anything one way or the other to Booth and

Gathers, couldn't we?

MR. ROSENBAUM:

You could affirm the Ohio

Supreme Court decision?

Gathers.

And I argue to you that this is because the Ohio

2

Supreme Court has misinterpreted this Court's holding in

3

Gathers when it ruled that it is no more heinous to commit

4

a crime when you know that you are going to leave

traumatized victims, that you are aware of, either at the

time you made your decision to kill or prior to making

that decision to kill.

intact and reverse the Ohio Supreme Court and reinstate

the death penalty.

So this Court could leave Gathers

10

I would like to argue today that Booth is a

11

departure from this Court's traditional jurisprudence

12

which is — made in capital litigation cases, which made

13

an attempt to channel the discretion of the jury and

14

evidence that it is to get.

15

sacrificed evidence that is relevant and necessary, and

16

that is victim impact evidence because, as this Court held

17

in Booth, it may create an impermissible risk of the death

18

penalty being arbitrarily imposed.

19

And to arrive at this it has

I argue to you that this presupposes that jurors

20

cannot ever be channeled or deal with victim impact

21

testimony in a rational way, nor can trial — nor can

22

trial courts regulate victim impact testimony.

23

QUESTION:

Do you think that if Booth and

24

Gathers were overruled we might expect that the kind of

testimony that was in this transcript would be fairly

typical in death penalty sentencing proceedings in which

2

the father of the victim recommends the death penalty?

3

MR. ROSENBAUM:

No.

And I'm going — I'm asking

4

this Court to overrule Booth and Gathers and permit only

5

objective, factual, easily rebuttable, readily

anticipatible victim impact testimony.

over my objection, which I think is irrelevant and

inappropriate, tried to counter and neutralize that, and I

it doesn't see fit to overrule Booth, to modify it and

provide that both sides can bring in objective and limited

victim impact testimony so that there will be an equal

20

balance between the State and the defense.

And I say that to you because if a jury is not

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure how, if you

9

thought the mother's testimony was appropriate -- was

10

inappropriate, that the trial was made all that much

11

better by introducing further inappropriate testimony by

12

the father on the same subject.

13

MR. ROSENBAUM:

In looking back on that case, or

14

that decision, I don't know if I would have made it.

15

I was in the middle of a trial, faced with the devastating

16

impact of testimony, prior to the Booth decision, that a

17

woman has now forgiven the murderer of her son, as a

18

Christian, when I have a predominantly if not entirely

19

Christian jury.

20

Now the State sought to neutralize that, and

21

maybe in hindsight that wasn't the best thing to do.

22

I think a modification or reversal of Booth will actually

23

prohibit this in the future, because the penalty phase

24

will be the penalty phase and not the mitigation phase,

MR. ROSENBAUM:

This — I argue to you that the

when the State went on to neutralize what the defendant

11

did, is either harmless error or an invited error, and

12

this case is not about this.

It's a rather strange argument to say

14

that the existence of Booth and Gathers invites testimony

15

of this sort.

I am asking you to overrule Booth and include
objective victim impact evidence, not opinion.

If this

Court will not do that, I am asking you to modify it so
the State is on an even keel, so that the State can put on
testimony concerning the actual impact felt and caused by
the murder, as opposed to the potential impact that is
going to fall to the defendant's family if he is executed.
And if this Court does not see fit to do that, I
then, as my final argument, ask you to overrule State v.
Huertas and reinstate the death penalty because the known
harm caused to a victim and his family that you are aware
of prior to your decision to kill is relevant to your
moral guilt and says something about your blameworthiness,
and thus should be considered.

What protections would there be

May I ask you this, Mr. Rosenbaum,

about the need to overrule Booth because of the harm it

That's correct.

No, I disagree.

Did the legislature refuse to speak

MR. ROSENBAUM:

When, when was that?
It was pre-Booth.

Given the fact that there is an Ohio

the death penalty would this — would the evidence be

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Well, first of all, the Ohio

you understood that.

Ohio clearly makes it mandatory in all other areas but

The only statute that may apply

to this type of situation is Ohio Revised Code section

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

I would like to begin by stating this morning

13

that the Ohio Supreme Court did base its holding on the

improper opinion testimony of the father in this case, and

15

it seems that my opponent this morning has conceded that

16

there was error in allowing the father's testimony.

17

To support my position I would first like to

18

start by the proposition of Ohio law that what is stated

19

in the syllabus is the law of the case, and any

20

conclusions in the opinion that are not carried forward

21

into the syllabus do not constitute the law of the case.

So if one looks at the syllabus in this case, it only

concerns the father's testimony.

But

1

the decision was not based upon State law grounds, because

2

before the decision in this case was rendered the Ohio

3

Supreme Court had already found that opinion testimony in

4

the ultimate issue that's not helpful to the trier of fact

5

is not admissible in a case, and this — and this decision

6

comports with that ruling.

7

In addressing the invited error doctrine, the

8

father's testimony was before the jury in this case, or

9

was admitted before the parents ever took the stand.

The

10

presentence investigation report was admitted into

11

evidence at the State's request before Mr. and Mrs. Harris

12

took the stand.

13

investigation report was a victim impact statement.

QUESTION:

6

But having been put in, if the judge

7

let that in, why wasn't the State justified in thinking

8

the judge would let the rebuttal to it in?

9

MS. BOUR-STOKES:

First of all, Your Honor,

10

since defense counsel already knew that the evidence was

11

before the jury because the VIS was admitted before they

12

ever took the stand, defense counsel had an indication

13

from the trial court that this type of evidence was going

14

to be relevant in his courtroom.

15

Mr. and Mrs. Harris' testimony, I think, was in direct

16

response to the fact that the trial court felt the PSI and

17

the VIS in this case was permissible under Ohio law, which

18

it is not.

So what progressed with

I would like to go on to address the victim

Did the Ohio legislature pass a statute that said

to conclude that you have to look at the legislative

history that went along with the statute.

13

originally introduced into the Ohio legislature it

The judge can say,

8

know the State says it's admissible, but that just means

9

it may be admitted, I can keep it out?

11
12

MS. BOUR-STOKES:

First of all, there are three

statutes that —
QUESTION:

See, I thought the statute was

13

compulsory, and all the State did was decline to make it

14

mandatory for capital cases, but without saying whether it

15

was admissible.

16

MS. BOUR-STOKES:

No, Your Honor, I do not read

17

the statute that way at all.

There are three statutes in

18

Ohio that cover victim impact.

19

if the victim's family wishes, it may make a statement at

20

a plea hearing or at trial.

21

a victim impact statement shall be considered by the trial

22

court, and those are very limited circumstancing — when

imposing — deciding what the minimum term should be for

24

an indefinite felony, and deciding what a fine should be.

So in only those two cases in Ohio is it mandatory that

the trial court consider victim impact information.
And the Ohio Supreme Court in another capital

case has already concluded that that statute does not

admitted under that statute.

9

QUESTION:

What is the Ohio statutory law right

now defining aggravating circumstances?
MS. BOUR-STOKES:

There is a specific statute in

Ohio, Your Honor, that lists — enumerates eight specific

10

aggravating circumstances.

11

in this case today does not fall within any of those

12

aggravating circumstances.

13

The type of evidence at issue

And it's also important to know that in Ohio

14

nonstatutory aggravating circumstances may not be admitted

15

at the penalty phase.

16

constitute an aggravating circumstance or a mitigating

17

factor, it is not relevant under Ohio law.

18

argument can be made before this Court today that the

19

testimony in this case, either Mr. or Mrs. Harris'

20

testimony, was somehow relevant to Ohio's capital

21

statutory scheme, because it's not.

22

QUESTION:

So if the evidence does not

constitutional ground, not on the ground that this

2

evidence doesn't go to any aggravating factor that Ohio

3

law allows.
MS. BOUR-STOKES:

4

No, Your Honor.

But in its

opinion the Ohio Supreme Court did discuss the jury's

6

constitutional obligation to weigh the aggravating

circumstances —

QUESTION:

Oh, but we —

But if there's some confusion

13

in this Court about what constitutional right means and

14

what the court meant by its syllabus, then this Court can

15

go into the text.

16

looks at the analysis the court used, it did rely on the

17

jury's obligation to weigh the aggravating circumstances

18

and mitigating factors, and that this evidence somehow

impinged on that obligation and was impermissible under

20

Ohio law.

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I would briefly like to say that I think the

22

the State asked of the victim's parents in this questions

was in a direct — was in direct rebuttal or was the exact

And
And the

QUESTION:

3

Of course, Mr. Rosenbaum, there is —

4

isn't there also a one-sidedness in the whole business of

you're limited to statutory aggravating circumstances on

the one side, but on the other side they can use

nonstatutory mitigating circumstances?

one-sided, too.
