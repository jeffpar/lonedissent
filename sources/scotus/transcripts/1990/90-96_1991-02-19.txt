ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA KRAUT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. KRAUT:

10

it please the Court:

ii

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may

This is a case of malice.

It's a case in which

12

a Federal official with knowledge of false information

13

communicated and published that false information anyway

14

to a third person, because he was bent on ruining and

15

destroying Frederick Siegert's reputation and good

16

standing in his professional community.

17

This is a case which stays a compensable injury

18

to a protected liberty interest.

19

substantive due process claims, pure and simple and

20

without question.

21

This is a case of a

In 1966 in a case called Rosenblatt v. Bear,

22

Justice Stewart, in his concurring opinion, stated that

23

the right to protect one's reputation is comparable to the

24

right to protect one's life itself.

25

that the right to protect one's reputation is a

1

fundamental right within the concept of liberty.

2

years earlier in a case called Adams v. Turner, a 1917

3

case, this Court stated something very similar when it

4

said that when you take the property upon which my house

5

sits, you take my house, and when you take the means

6

whereby I live, you take my life.

7

Siegert did.

8

what he wanted to do premeditatively.

9

for Frederick Siegert, that is what he succeeded at doing.

10
11

12

That is what Frederick

That is what he was bent on doing.

QUESTION:

Fifty

That is

And unfortunately

I guess all that's not true if you're

a public figure however?
MS. KRAUT:

I think that if Frederick Siegert

13

were a public figure, he would be able to bring a claim of.

14

this sort, because actual malice would be shown.

15

the substantive and the facts that we did allege in this

16

case, we do think that*we do meet an actual malice

17

standard, Your Honor.

18

And by

Frederick Siegert did state a — a compensable

19

injury as I said, stigma plus, to a protected liberty

20

interest, the right to pursue one's calling without the

21

malicious interference of the Government.

22

in — or — and held in Paul v. Davis, in Meyer, in Doe,

23

in Bartel, in White v. Nicholls and a few other cases, the

24

right that was violated was so well established in October

25

of 1985 that no reasonable public official in Gilley's

And as stated

position could possibly not have known that what he was

2

doing was wrong.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Kraut, the first question

4

presented in your petition for certiorari is the extent of

5

discovery which you should be allowed where there's a

6

defensive qualified immunity.

do with the merits of your case I would think.

MS. KRAUT:

It's closely connected to it.

That really has nothing to

The merits of the case and

10

whether or not the allegations — the factual allegations

11

that Siegert alleged below was hotly and vigorously

12

contested by the Government below.

13

court below in fact that the factual allegations were

14

insufficient to meet that heightened pleading standard.

15

And we think that, under the rules of this Court, that it

is within the general parameters of the question that was

17

actually presented.

18

connection to it, and we do ask the Court to answer that.

19

It was decided by the

So we think there is a very close

I believe it was also — that's as far as the

20

substantive claim is concerned.

21

closely connected and it ought to be addressed.

22

We do think that it is

In fact the Government hotly contested it in its

23

briefs to this Court.

24

I contested it on the other side of the coin, we think

25

that it is right for this Court to decide whether in fact,

And given that it did — given that

And of course, we think they did for many

QUESTION:

You will eventually get to the

question presented then?
MS. KRAUT:

I will, Your Honor.

But if I

8

could — if the Court would like me to address that right

9

now, I'll be happy to.

But what I would like to do is —

10

is essentially state what the factual allegations were so

11

that when the Court looks at those factual allegations in

12

relation to the discovery rule that's being challenged, I

13

think it will be a slightly more complete picture.

14

What Siegert alleged were the following.

He

15

alleged that he had had exemplary job performance ratings

16

for his entire time at Saint Elizabeths.

17

he had been hired because of his expertise in the treating

18

— in treating mentally retarded people, severely mentally

19

retarded people.

20

of the behavior modification treatment unit for the —

21

almost the entire time that he was employed by Saint

22

Elizabeths.

23

He alleged that

He alleged that he was the coordinator

He alleged that he trained others in the area of

24

behavior modification treatment.

25

ethics had never before been questioned.

He alleged that his

He alleged that

1

he had signed a 3-year contract with the Army when he

2

wanted to be transferred, and one can assume from that

3

that the Army made some inquiry into his background and

4

knew that he was an ethical — an expert in his field.

5

He alleged that there had been longstanding

6

professional and personal conflicts with Gilley.

He

7

alleged that Gilley knew almost nothing about behavior

8

modification, and he alleged that he and others on the

9

behavior modification treatment unit resisted Gilley's

10

attempts in that first month to change certain aspects of

11

the behavior modification treatment program.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. KRAUT:

Where is Dr. Siegert now?
Your Honor, he — it's not in the

14

record, but if the Court wants it off the record, Dr.

15

Siegert is employed in a private HMO plan — sort of a —

16

I don't know exactly what they are -- but it's an HMO

17

private institution.

18

people.

21

He is not treating mentally retarded

He is —
QUESTION:

Is he engaged in clinical psychology

at all?
MS. KRAUT:

He is engaged in clinical

22

psychology.

23

and because of the area of expertise in which he

24

practiced, not only at Saint Elizabeths but as he alleged

25

also at Forrest Haven and other institutions, totally and

However, Your Honor, because of his training

only in the area of treating the most severely retarded

2

people you can imagine — that is his expertise.

3

though someone told me that I couldn't practice the kind

4

of law I practice and I would have to practice tax law,

5

and all apologies to any tax lawyers in the room.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

MS. KRAUT:

Well, I think that — my sympathy,

Your Honor.

(Laughter.)

MS. KRAUT:

13

Well, that happened to me when I cub

in an office.

8

10

It's as

But I — I guess it didn't hurt you

though.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. KRAUT:

I think that if, if a person wants

16

to practice a certain area of law, or a person wants to

17

practice as an — and is trained in practicing a

18

particular type of medicine or psychology or whatever,

19

they ought to be able to do it.

20

practice his profession anymore, because the only place

21

that he can practice it is in public institutions, and

22

because of what happened to him as a result of Gilley's

23

actions, he is no longer able to be hired by institutions,

24

because, as the Stuttgart personnel said when he went

25

there to try to work, because of what we've heard about

Mr. — Dr. Sieger.t cannot

2

And it is — that is a liberty interest that is

3

— that has been cut off by Gilley, and as I said, we

4

think that he ought to be able to seek compensation.
QUESTION:

5

May I ask right at this point, on the

6

question whether there was a clearly established claim

7

before, as I remember the Government's position is that

8

the procedural due process claim was clearly established,

9

but that the record indicates he did have a fair

10

opportunity for a name-clearing hearing, which is all the

11

Constitution guarantees.

12

MS. KRAUT:

What's your response to that?

Your Honor, this is not a procedural

13

case,

and there is no process that can clear his name.

14

Let -- let me say that —

15

QUESTION-:

And it is clear that -- is it clear

16

that if it's not a procedural case,

that there was a

17

clearly established nonprocedural right?

18

case established it.

19

MS. KRAUT:

Well, Hearn, Your Honor,

20

Hearn v.

Eleventh Circuit case.

Meyer v. Nebraska, with Paul v. Davis.

And if so, what

I think

QUESTION:

terms of substantive, I think that if I could use Justice

Souter's case'in New Hampshire that he decided in 1988,

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

6

MS. KRAUT:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

I'm not sure you'd better do that.

Well, Your Honor —
Because that was a procedural due

process case.
MS. KRAUT:

Your Honor, I — that's true, but in

10

Richardson — in the Richardson case, Your Honor did refer

11

to the fact that that case could have been a substantive

12

due process claim and referred specifically to Meyer v.

13

Nebraska and to Schware as establishing that substantive

14

due process — that substantive due process claim.

15

Now --

16

QUESTION:

17

I'd better go back and give that one

a second thought.

18

MS. KRAUT:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MS. KRAUT:

I have it right here, Your Honor.

In — but what the court did in New

21

Hampshire, what Justice Souter did in New Hampshire, was

22

say, no, this is a procedural case, because, number one,

23

there was a process that was in place.

24

State — the State of New Hampshire apparently

25

acknowledged that they had violated their own procedure.

And secondly, the

1

And thirdly, my recollection is that this fellow

2

may have already been — have already made his admission

3

that he had — I think already said that he had done what

4

the State that he did.

5

substantive due process claim was ever raised in that

6

case, directly or indirectly from what I can gather.

7

And fourthly, I don't think a

But I think it's — coming back — I think the

8

fact that Justice Souter in that case did refer to

9

Nebraska and to Schware is an indication that, given that

10

the factual circumstances in the two case are so similar

11

that at least it — what it does is provide very strong

12

guidance that in fact Meyer and Schware can stand for the

13

liberty interest and the compensable injuries that are at

14

stake here and —

15

QUESTION:

But isn't — isn't the point though

16

that those cases, just as you just said, identify the

17

inte'rest which is subject to protection, but they don't

18

define the manner in which the interest will be protected.

19

And what the later cases hold and in what that case of

20

mine that you referred to happen to hold, was that there

21

are certain procedural due process protections, but none

22

of them are substantive due process cases in the sense of

23

providing an absolutely protection, let's say, in the

24

Richardson case against libel as such.

Amendment.
MS. KRAUT:

2

Your Honor, I think that I — what

3

— what I think has to be looked at here is — first of

4

all, Richards — Anderson states, I think quite

5

explicitly, that the precise character of the right does

6

not have to be set forth in precision.

7

kind of case is comparable to, for example, a — an Eighth

8

Amendment claim of deliberate indifference in a prison

9

setting for medical treatment for prisoners.

Secondly, this

That is a —

10

and entirely a tort action of medical malpractice but with

11

an unconstitutional motive attached.

12

from a tort claim into a constitutional claim.

13

And that turns it

In the Fourth Amendment area, the battery — the

14

tort of battery is turned into a Fourth Amendment

15

violation, because again, because of a -- an

16

unconstitutional motive.

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Kraut, you have spent half of

18

your oral argument now on a question which you say is

19

subsumed.

20

of the questions presented in your petition for

21

certiorari.

22

23
24
25

You really haven't explicitly addressed either

I suggest you do so.

QUESTION:

I'll be happy to do that right now,

Your Honor.
What the Government wants, Your Honor, on this
— on this rule that is actually presented is the

1

Government wants to have its cake and eat it, too.

They

2

want a post-discovery standard — what we view anyway as a

3

post-discovery standard — applied to a pre-discovery

4

proceeding without letting the — the plaintiff, a Bivens

5

plaintiff or a civil rights plaintiff, have the benefit of

6

any discovery.
And we are asking the Court today to state

7
8

clearly that that may not happen, and we are proposing a

9

rule to the Court that is, we think, more consistent with

10

what — what Anderson and Harlow state.

It is more

11

consistent with what Article III states.

12

consistent with what the Federal rules committees have

13

proposed and have amended in terms of the rules of Federal

14

civil procedure.

It is more

And that rule is — our proposed rule is that

15
16

prior to discovery and in opposition to a summary judgment

17

motion where qualified immunity has been raised, if malice

18

has been alleged in connection with otherwise lawful

19

conduct, there should be some evidentiary basis of malice

20

which would demonstrate with some plausibility that a

21

Bivens plaintiff's opposition is justified and that he

22

might defeat a qualified immunity claim.

%

Where malice is alleged as an element of already

24

established unlawful conduct, malice may be alleged

generally.

there are material issues generally in dispute on matters

concerning qualified immunity.

We think that that rule is consistent with Article III.

QUESTION:

That is in fact what we

Is that consistent with what the

district court did here?
MS. KRAUT:

This rule is -- we think what the

17

district court did was to take all of our allegations,

18

which I began to read but haven't finished — all of those

19

allegations he applied — Judge Sporkin applied the

20

heightened pleading standard, not this standard.

21

applied the circuit court's heightened pleading standard

22

as he was bound to do, and he made a determination that on

23

the issues of falsity and on the issues of malice that

24

there were material facts — that those are material facts

25

and that they were genuinely in dispute and that the

allegations of malice and falsity were so sufficient that

a reasonable jury could find that, if this case went to

trial, that they would be able to find for Dr. Siegert.

5

QUESTION:

And so he would have allowed some

discovery?

6

MS. KRAUT:

He allowed — and what he ordered in

7

fact was discovery on two issues, and I think it's at page

8

52 or 54a of the appendix — he specifically ordered

9

limited discovery on the issues of falseness and malice

10

when he ordered the depositions of Siegert, of Gilley, and

11

of Colonel Smith.

first order of December of 1987, I believe it was, he also

ordered I think some production of some documents.

required him to go but not as far?

MS. KRAUT:

No.

No, no, no.

rule now imposes two things.

The D.C. Circuit's

Number one, it imposes a

10

direct evidence — allegations of direct evidence.

11

I don't know frankly whether Judge Sporkin made a

12

determination whether direct evidence had been alleged,

13

but in any event the Government has conceded that that,

14

particular aspect of the court's rule should not — should

15

not be upheld, because it has absolutely no legal

16

foundation.

17

just a whole host of cases that circumstantial evidence is

18

not as good as direct evidence.

19

It corfflicts with Holland.

He —

It conflicts with

The second prong, however, of the district

20

court's heightened pleading's standard is that prior to

21

discovery a Bivens plaintiff has to allege specific facts

22

in conformity with a post-discovery standard, specific

23

facts showing that in fact there are material facts in

24

dispute and that a reasonable jury could find for the

25

nonmoving party.

QUESTION:

1

I still don't understand your answer

2

to my question, which was whether the district court's

3

order in this case went as far as one — as a district

4

court would go applying the standard you're proposing to

5

this Court?
MS. KRAUT:

6

He went further, because — he went

7

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16

Very well, Ms. Kraut.

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

17

In Harlow against Fitzgerald this Court held

18

that a plaintiff in a Bivens action cannot overcome the

19

defense of qualified immunity, and therefore, proceed with

20

the litigation by alleging that the official acted with

21

malice.

22

plaintiff may do so where malice or improper motive

23

happens to be an element of the constitutional claim.

24
25

The question presented here is whether the

immunity defense, general allegations of malice do not

2

This requirement which may be — this so-called

defense of qualified immunity in these particular lawsuits

11

retains its substantive scope and effect.

12
13

QUESTION:

You say this is a pleading

requirement, Mr. Lazerwitz?

14

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in

15

strict terms it really isn't.

16

pleading requirement I think has caused more confusion

17

than is necessary, because under the Federal rules, a

18

plaintiff can — under Rule 8 and Rule 9, a plaintiff can

don't challenge this *— can allege malice in general

In Bivens the court held that there —

Harlow, years later, recognized there's a

10

that was unacceptable.

Harlow, and what the lower courts have been tackling in

12

the meantime, is the problem presented here.

13

when the plaintiff doesn't allege malice in order to

defeat the immunity, but has to allege malice because

made clear that the immunity is, as I mentioned before —

it's an immunity not to be burdened by litigation.

In order to have —

May I ask you another question?

In

this case there was an alternative common law count for

QUESTION:

No, but it doesn't -- in Justice

Steven's hypo, it seems to me that it doesn't mean
anything, because the reason for the immunity at the stage
we're talking about is to prevent the litigation, not
merely recovery, but to prevent litigation.

And on his

hypothetical, the litigation is going to go on, because
you're going to have discovery on the defamation claim
anyway.

So the whole policy of applying the immunity

doctrine at that point would be negated by your other
cause of action.
MR. LAZERWITZ:
responses.

Well, there -- I mean, two

One is and I'll repeat it.

The Federal

defendant has a right not to be -- not to be sued on that
cause of action.

The fact that he might in the

hypothetical be sued under a common law cause of action is
essentially beside the point.

wouldn't be Federal — there wouldn't be common law
actions against the individual defendant.

about, that you have the right — you have the defense not

If the plaintiff can't do that,

then the plaintiff has to file a Rule 56(f) affidavit,
