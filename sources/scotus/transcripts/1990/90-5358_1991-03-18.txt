CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear now in

argument No. 90-5358, Thomas Braxton v. The United States.
Mr. Cribari.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. CRIBARI

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CRIBARI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a sentencing guidelines case of some

11

consequence to criminal defendants and practitioners of

12

criminal law.

13

implement a charge offense system of sentencing.

14

the guidelines a defendant expects to be sentenced or the

15

offense or offenses for which he is convicted.

16

As you know the sentencing guidelines
Under

There are defined exceptions to that general

17

rule, and the guideline at issue in this case contains one

18

of those exceptions.

19

defendant enters a guilty plea containing a stipulation

20

which establishes an offense more serious than the offense

21

of conviction, that defendant can expect his base offense

22

level or, if you will, his presumptive sentence, to be

23

based on the stipulated offense, not the offense of

24

conviction.

25

The exception is that when a

The issue in Mr. Braxton's case is whether the

1

technical terra "stipulation" can be so broadly interpreted

2

that a defendant who refuses to stipulate, who makes it

3

clear on the record that he does not intend the

4

stipulation, denies committing the more serious offense,

5

and keeps in issue an essential element of that offense

6

may nevertheless be found to have stipulated because he

7

acknowledges the Government's factual proffer on the

8

offenses to which he intends to plead guilty.

9

QUESTION:

How is the Government -- how does the

10

Government's factual proffer come up in this case?

11

to show the voluntariness of the plea?

12

MR. CRIBARI:

Was it

It came up in the extremely

13

ordinary fashion of turning to the Government at the

14

appropriate time during the Rule 11 inquiry and asking for

15

the factual basis for the plea.

16

what its facts would be -- had -- would the case go to

17

trial, and Mr. Braxton acknowledged those facts as acts

18

that he did.

19

The Government proffered

At the same time he maintained that he did not

20

intend to kill anybody.

21

facts that the Government proffered, that Mr. Braxton, who

22

has been on a community release from a mental hospital,

23

had stopped reporting for his medication.

24

had been dispatched to bring him back.

25

identified who they were and why they were there, he then

The marshals

threatened them.

He refused to go back.

And when they

2

kicked his door open, he fired shots at the door.
I think it's important to bear in mind factually

that Mr. Braxton — and the evidence would be clear on

this — did not fire through the opening of the door at

The door then closed.
I don't really get exactly — perhaps

you should be more explicit about it.

12

MR. CRIBARI:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

About how that happened?

Well, was the door open when he fired

the shots?
MR. CRIBARI:

The door had a chain guard on it.

16

And one of the marshals kicked the door open so that it

17

snapped open into the apartment.

18

fired and lodged in the — what would be the front of that

19

door -- which they could only do had the shots been fired

20

across the front of the apartment toward what was now the

21

open face of the door.

22

perpendicularly to the opening of the door.

QUESTION:

The shots were then

In other words, they were fired

But none were fired before the door

None were fired before the door

The words were exchanged.

QUESTION:

MR. CRIBARI:

And when the

Well, I think it's clear he

intended to assault the marshals by this act to frighten

6

them away — to say, I am not going back to the mental

7

hospital.

8

you come in, I'll kill you.

threats made.

If you — he went to so far as to threaten, if
I mean, there were overt

But at the time the proffer was made by the

10

Government, what Mr. Braxton said and what he said at

sentencing was, I did not intend to kill those people.

I intended to

I did not intend killing.

14

Now —

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Cribari, based on the facts that

16

were admitted at the plea hearing, could the sentencing

17

judge have imposed the same sentence by enhancing the

18

sentence under the guidelines and reach the same result

19

that he reached here?

20

MR. CRIBARI:

Justice O'Connor, I think it's

21

certainly possible, but what's at issue is the manner of

22

doing it.

23

it is crucial.

24
25

I

And under the guidelines, the manner of doing

QUESTION:

But on these facts he could have

achieved the same result by another mechanism.

MR. CRIBARI:

1

I hesitate to say, categorically,

2

yes.

The answer is he could do it.

3

is that in doing so, he would have to engage in a

4

departure analysis.

5

the courts have been fairly clear that all departures,

6

upward or downward, have to be structured.

7

developed the term "guided departures."
QUESTION:

8

9

But the answer also

And engaging in a departure analysis,

We've

At --

Well, if you were correct on the

proposition that you bring to us, at the very least I

10

suppose we should remand to let the trial judge determine

11

if the same sentence should be imposed on another basis.

MR. CRIBARI:

We would happily take that
I think that that's the correct

14

procedure that has to happen.

15

base offense level for the aggravated assault, and you

16

have to engage in discussion as to why the next level is

17

not appropriate, why the next level — and why this

18

sentence would be acceptable.

19

QUESTION:

You have to start from the

Now, would you tell us what the

20

Sentencing Guidelines Commission's position is at present

21

on the interpretation of this provision?

22

MR. CRIBARI:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CRIBARI:

25

This stipulation provision?

Yes.
Your Honor, I think the sentencing

guidelines interpretation is fairly clear.

Under 1B1.2 in

1

the commentary, the Sentencing Commission cites to a House

2

report which is the subject of some discussion in the

3

briefs that refers to stipulations of this nature being

4

contained in plea agreements.

5

discussion that they should be in writing necessarily, but

6

that they should be part of a plea agreement.

QUESTION:

There's not a specific

9

guidelines, do they take positions on their interpretation

of what they've issued?

interpretation of their own rules.

like a rule of the guidelines.

or is the only thing they can do is reenact a different

guideline?

don't they?

I just don't know how to

Do they take any positions on interpretation

They have this under consideration right now,

MR. CRIBARI:

They do.

They have under

19

consideration a proposed amendment to this guideline

questioning whether it should be made specifically clear

21

in the guideline as part of the black letter law that --

22

QUESTION:

And what if they do?

Is that

23

retroactive?

24

interpretation of its own — of its own regulation?

25

like Congress' enactment of a new statute?

Do we treat that as though it's an agency's

Well, I think the Commission take

the position that these would clarifying amendments which

would be effective at the time anyone would be sentenced

under them and would have no retroactive effect in --

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, if it's a clarifying

amendment, all it's doing is making more clear what once

was the case.

It would have a retroactive effect

Right.

I know what you mean.
MR. CRIBARI:

Well, Your Honor, I think it would

19

have a retroactive offense -- effect in the sense that it

20

is making clear what has always been the case.

21

don't think people who have already been sentenced could

22

have all of their sentences reheard because some — the

23

law had been changed in a way that would have a benefit to

24

those people.

QUESTION:

1
2

What precisely is the amendment that

the Commission is considering?
MR. CRIBARI:

3

The Commission's amendment reads

4

as follows, and it's extremely short:

5

to 1B1.2, regard -- which regards stipulations to more

6

serious offense should be amended to provide expressly

7

that such stipulation must be part of a formal plea

8

agreement.

10

QUESTION:

And that is what it is considering

but has not acted upon?
MR. CRIBARI:

11

That is what it is soliciting

comment on doing.

QUESTION:

MR. CRIBARI:

16

kind.

17

proposed amendment

QUESTION:

Is this a formal plea agreement?
There was no plea agreement in
There was no plea agreement of any

Does formal plea agreement mean

18

written, in your view?

19

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, I think the better practice

20

is written, and I think the rules — at least the local

21

rules of the district court in Maryland would require in

22

the felony situation that we have a written agreement.

23

I'm not sure it needs to be written.

24

Circuit in McCall has said that, whether written or oral,

25

it must be formal and must be part of a plea agreement.

I think the Second

Of course, what's ultimately at issue is will a

1

2

defendant be sentenced presumptively to a base offense

3

level for an offense that he does not acknowledge

4

committing.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Cribari, am I correct that if the

6

Commission adopts what they have proposed to adopt, your

7

client would -- would win?

8

MR. CRIBARI:

9

QUESTION:

Is that -- is that right?

That's accurate.

Since —

Now, what if -- what if we -- what if

10

we find against your client, and then the Commission

11

adopts what it has proposed to adopt?
MR. CRIBARI:

12

Your Honor, that puts me in the

13

awkward position of saying perhaps my client then should

14

file some kind of 2255 alleging my ineffectiveness for not

15

foreseeing that that would be the case for him.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Oh, but you think we would win

though?
MR. CRIBARI:

Well, I — you would have a

19

situation where the Commission will have changed the

20

guidelines, or -- sorry -- where the Commission will have

21

clarified guidelines in a way opposite to what this Court

22

could do in this case.

23

Certainly, you have a situation where that would

24

be concededly unfair to a defendant.

25

could be some kind of review.

And hopefully there

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, certainly the Commission —

if this Court found a -- in the Government's favor in this

case -- the Commission could enact the guideline or

10

reenact the guideline or amend the guideline to make it

consistent with my position.

to Mr. Braxton in the meantime?

He goes to jail.
Well, he's already there, and I

benefit of -- of the Commission's amending a guideline

were to do that.

attempt to take this Court en banc in the Fourth Circuit?

MR. CRIBARI:

1

There was not, Your Honor.

I'll

2

be happy to say why.

3

in this case.

4

the trial court had ruled that Mr. Braxton could not get

5

it to a level of reduction for acceptance of

6

responsibility because he frankly was insane — could not

7

show remorse for his actions.

8

show rehabilitation, and rehabilitation was necessary to

9

get the benefit of acceptance of responsibility.

We had won one portion of the appeal

On the acceptance of responsibility issue

Remorse was necessary to

The Fourth Circuit ruled that that's not true,

10
11

that rehabilitation has nothing to do with incarceration,

12

and at least in the incarceration sentence a defendant

13

need not show a step toward rehabilitation to show that he

14

accepts responsibility.

15

QUESTION:

Well, you've got a divided vote here.

16

It would have been interesting to know where Judge Wilkins

17

stood.

18

MR. CRIBARI:

Well, it would have, Your Honor.

19

I think you can get that from his low review article.

20

I think you can understand where Judge Wilkins stands from

21

the proposed amendment, which was proposed after the

22

Fourth Circuit's decision in Braxton, and certainly he

23

would not have been ware of that sitting on that court.

24
25

QUESTION:

And

Do we give special weight to those

courts that have members of the Commission on them?

MR. CRIBARI:

And — and it was not particularly-

I think you give weight to expert judges in

light of what their expertise is.

say just because Judge Wilkins wrote a law review article,

taking a certain position, that therefore that's the

position of the Commission, and this is a pronouncement

11

that you must defer to.

MR. CRIBARI:

My point is that without a formal

agreement between the parties or between the lawyers

position of coming to court, making its factual proffer,

Mr. Marzen, why did the stipulation,

they did for two reasons.

that the shots were fired at the marshals, at chest and

Petitioner's submission is basically that he was only

21

trying to use the gunshots to frighten the marshals away,

In other

QUESTION:

Well, I think the sophisticated

counsel might have been very interested to know that the
judge was going to consider the higher baseline offense,
and that was never advised in open court until the
sentence was pronounced.
MR. MARZEN:

It was never advised that he would,

but defense counsel was certainly on notice that he could.
And that's -- and that gave him the ability to go into the
Rule 11 hearing and either agree or disagree with the
stipulation with his eyes open.

Second -- and this is

also important -- defendants in general are not going to
lightly agree to aggravating circumstances as part of
satisfying the factual basis for a guilty plea because
other things turn on it besides deciding which guideline
applies.
The sentencing judge in all cases will still
have the decision where within the guideline's range to
sentence the defendant.

That is an enormous incentive

right there to make -- to not agree to aggravating
circumstances because you want your client to see the
sentence at the low end of the guideline.
In addition, if the aggravating circumstances in
the Government's factual proffer are grave enough, they
might well form the basis for a departure later at the
sentencing hearing.

That would be another reason why, if

I think the answer turns on whether

there is -- this case is still kicking around the courts.

12

If the sentence is still open, I think it would be a

procedural amendment and would well apply retroactively.

If you --

You say the plea of guilty itself

MR. MARZEN:

No, the plea of guilty does have to

MR. MARZEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, if you want

to follow me, it's at page 22 of the joint appendix — the

8

first sentence in the second paragraph beginning on that

9

page.

"Nevertheless, we've explained to Mr. Braxton that

10

you're going to consider all these facts in determining

11

the sentence, both considering them under the guideline to

departures under the guideline."

QUESTION:

Mr. Cribari, are there instances

other than for raising the base offense level in which a
client would want to stipulate that he committed a greater
offense?

Does this come up just in the context of the

sentencing for the purposes of applying the guidelines or
would there be other plea agreements whereby he would
stipulate that he committed an offense?
MR. CRIBARI:

He might stipulate he committed an

offense if he were sure he were not going to have a
sentencing damage for it for purposes of acknowledging
full criminal conduct.

I mean, there's no argument here

that Mr. Braxton could not be sentenced for what he did.
The argument is he a right to have the sentence
calculation start at the lower level.
QUESTION:

I understand.

Thank you, Mr. Cribari.

MR. CRIBARI:
