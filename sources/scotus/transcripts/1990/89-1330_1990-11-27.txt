ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. MICHEL PIERSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. PIERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the interpretation of Section

13

401(c) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure

14

Act, which places a duty upon unions to distribute, on

15

behalf of candidates for union office, campaign literature

16

upon their reasonable requests.

17

how to determine what is reasonable request, the case

18

raises issues involving the competing policies underlying

19

LMRDA, which are the furtherance of union democracy and

20

the prevention of unnecessary interference with the

21

internal affairs of unions.

22

In posing the issue of

We submit that the holding of the Fourth

23

Circuit, which held that the MM&P's election procedure was

24

not entitled to consideration in determining whether

25

Respondent's request to distribute literature was

reasonable, not only unduly impairs the MM&P's right to
govern its own affairs, but also ultimately is contrary to
union democracy.
The case arose in the summer of 1988 when Brown,
stating that he wished to be a candidate for president in
the upcoming election of MM&P officers, made a request to
the union to be permitted to disseminate literature prior
to the convention, which was scheduled for August of 1988.
The union denied the request based upon its longstanding
election procedure set forth in its constitution, which
provides that the right to mailing begins only when the
ballot committee of rank-and-file members that runs the
election is elected at the convention.
Brown brought suit under section 401(c).

The

case was heard 2 weeks later on a motion for temporary
restraining order, and the district court held in favor of
respondent.

The court not only held that the focus should

be on whether the request was reasonable, but that the
rule itself was unreasonable.

The case then went to the

Fourth Circuit, which affirmed, expressly distinguishing
precedent from other circuits, and the case came to this
Court on petition for writ of certiorari.
Now, in determining how to construe section -QUESTION:

Mr. Pierson, I take it that the court

of appeals did not reach the question of whether the

1

district court was correct in finding the union rule

2

unreasonable?

3

MR. PIERSON:

It did not.

The Fourth Circuit's

opinion speaks only in terms of the legal issue, finding

5

that it should consider —

determination if, it has to be taken into consideration?
MR. PIERSON:

That is correct.

It seems to me

15

that the proper course would be to remand to the Fourth

16

Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this

17

Court's opinion, because one of the subsidiary questions

18

involved, assuming the Court does hold that the union's

19

rule is entitled to be respected --

20

QUESTION:

Well, apart from the rule, do you

21

think there is anything unreasonable about the

22

respondent's request to communicate before the convention?

23

MR. PIERSON:

Our position in this case is based

24

solely upon our election procedure, and we contend that

QUESTION:

1

Well, my question is do you think

2

there is anything unreasonable about that request, apart

3

from the union's rule?

4

MR. PIERSON:

If we were litigating this case in

5

another union that did not have that provision in the

6

constitution, then — well, let me back up for a moment,

7

because this gets to one of the problems in the

8

distinction between the Fourth Circuit's approach and the

9

Third Circuit's approach, which is that a request is not

10

reasonable or unreasonable in a vacuum.

11

that it is reasonable or unreasonable in the context of

12

the uniop's elections procedures.

13

appropriate answer to your question, Justice O'Connor,

14

might be that it's not possible to answer the question of

15

whether a request is reasonable or unreasonable, except as

It seems to me

So that I think a more

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, if the union didn't have a

18

rule, I suppose it certainly is possible to answer that

19

question.

20

MR. PIERSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

If -- that is correct.

And my question to you is, absent the

rule, is there anything unreasonable about the request?
MR. PIERSON:

The -- we do not take the position

24

in this litigation that we — his request is unreasonable

25

separate and apart from its relation to the union's rule.

QUESTION:

1

What level of scrutiny do you think

2

we need to apply in evaluating the union's rule, if it has

3

to be taken into consideration?

4

MR. PIERSON:

It seems to me that the Court

5

should look at the circumstances of the promulgation of

6

the union's rule, the circumstances of the union's

7

election procedure, that is, whether there has been abuse

8

of the type that LMRDA was intended to combat, entrenched

9

incumbents who abused channels of communication with the

10

membership, and also —

11

QUESTION:

Well, is it a level of scrutiny of

12

rationality, in effect?

13

particular about this scheme that requires any special

14

level of scrutiny?

15

MR. PIERSON:

I mean, is there anything in

Well, I would say that rationality

16

is one aspect of it, but I would also say that if there is

17

a showing that the rule was adopted solely to impair the

18

rights of candidates to communicate with the membership --

19

now, I suppose that's an aspect of rationality because it

20

goes to the question of what were the reasons for adoption

21

of the rule and the circumstances of the adoption of the

22

rule.

23

scrutiny.

24

would be adequate.

25

But I would not see any reason for heightened
It seems to me that the basic rationality test

2

fashioning that standard the statute imposes a duty upon

unions to measure requests to determine whether they are

It eliminates any

10

manipulation of the election procedures by the incumbents

11

in the granting or denial of requests.

12

of the statute itself, the statute does not preclude the

13

adoption of a reasonable rule, and therefore we must look

14

at the policy underlying the statute to resolve this

15

question.

16

So that in terms

Now, it is certainly true that one of the

17

policies underlying LMRDA was the prevention of abuse by

18

entrenched incumbents, and Congress passed LMRDA in order

19

to further union democracy in the face of evidence that

20

was presented to the McClellan Committee of abuse by

21

entrenched incumbents in a sample of unions that the

22

committee examined.

24

about the construction of section 401(c).

25

nothing peculiar about section 401(c) in terms of

There is

In fact, the entire statute,

2

all of LMRDA, was passed for this very reason, that is to

prevent abuse by incumbents because of evidence that

incumbents had abused their advantages in a number of

ways:

7

Nonetheless, the balance of LMRDA, the sections

8

other than 401(c), make repeated reference to union rules

9

and union constitutions.

In fact, throughout the statute

there are no less than eight references to union

constitutions.

One of the ways that Congress intended to combat

18

abuse by entrenched incumbents was by requiring adherence

19

to union constitutions and union rules of procedure, and

20

that is apparent from the structure of the entire act.

21

there is nothing peculiar about section 401(c).

22

401(c) is not the only section that affects the rights of

insurgents or the power of incumbents to preserve their

position in office.

how that could be an unreasonable request.
MR. PIERSON:

regulate the election procedure might affect campaign

10

requests in a number of ways.

11

campaign requests in a number of ways that could

12

conceivably impose a burden upon one seeking union office.

13

It seems to me that it is not sufficient to say that the

14

only question in construing section 401(c) would be will

15

it benefit the candidate or not.

16

QUESTION:

Well, but, what -- what burden would

MR. PIERSON:

QUESTION:

MR. PIERSON:

about, from the MM&P's standpoint, Brown's request for

general rule, but it very definitely is about Brown's

request.

We decide the cases on the facts before us.
MR. PIERSON:

2

I know, but what I mean to say is

3

this, that Brown was not the only candidate running for

4

office in the 1988 election, and the presidential election

5

was not the only election being held there.

6

election procedures in the MM&P constitution govern

7

elections for all offices, that is, all the vice

8

presidents, the convention delegates, and the procedure

9

was set up to govern all of those contests.

The — the

may always be true in looking at a single request that one

might say that granting this request will not burden the

That does not, however, contradict the fact —

union if numerous candidates requested mailing information

18

and mailing at their own expense?

19

MR. PIERSON:

What hurt would come to the

Simply that it would impose a

20

greater burden upon the union to grant those requests at a

21

time before it has made the determination as to who is a

22

bona fide candidate.

23

QUESTION:

Well, so -- you're saying that, what,

24

is it time spent by union employees that would be the

25

burden?

MR. PIERSON:

1

That's not -- no, we're not saying

2

that's the sole burden, Your Honor.

3

that the union has an interest in ensuring that its

literature distribution provisions are used only by bona

7

the section 401(c) being passed in the way that it was.

8

10

We are also saying

And that is one of the things that was

QUESTION:

How do you define bona fide

candidate?
MR. PIERSON:

We would — the MM&P constitution

11

requires that candidates meet a number of requirements at

12

the time they are nominated in order to be eligible.

13

have to -- there is a continuous dues payment requirement,

14

so that a member must have paid his dues continuously in

15

advance for the 2 years preceding the nomination.

16

is a requirement that a member serve under his license for

17

a period of 180 days during the period.

18

QUESTION:

They

There

Well, but these candidates, people

19

who don't qualify, will ultimately be filtered out at some

20

stage of the proceedings.

21

-- if a person who perhaps isn't ultimately going to

22

qualify for the nomination, if that person wants to

23

circulate campaign literature at his own expense, what

24

harm that does to the union.

25

MR. PIERSON:

I still don't see why, even if

an institutional interest in seeing that the right is not

that the union is not entitled to censor campaign

6

were no rule regulating the distribution procedure and we

7

simply provided that anybody at anytime, regardless of how

8

close it is tq an election, could come in and request

9

distribution of literature, then that would be a way that

Now, the Department of Labor regulations provide

So that if the -- if there

10

would harm the union's interest in limiting use of the

11

distribution procedure to bona fide candidates.

12

Now --

13

QUESTION:

Well, you say, in other words, that

14

only someone who can meet all the union's rules for

15

nomination is entitled to have the campaign literature

16

distributed?

17

MR. PIERSON:

I am saying that the rule in this

18

case, because it provides for the distribution right at a

19

time when the ballot committee, an independent

20

organization of rank and file members, has determined who

21

is a candidate, that it is reasonable to draw the line

22

there.

23

election procedure is more reasonable than -- what I'm

24

saying is we're not talking about an arbitrary rule that

25

somebody made up just to draw a bright line.

That a line that is drawn in terms of the union's

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Now, I am

1

saying that that is one of the interests that the union

2

has in enforcing its rule.

3

Another interest that the union has in this case

4

is in enforcing a rule that was not made up by the

5

officers, but was adopted as part of the union's

6

constitution that was approved by the entire membership

7

and is part of a detailed set of election procedures for

8

regulation of the election and fits in with those.

9

that it really is a matter of extracting from that

So

10

detailed procedure this one rule and carving it out, and

11

that denies the interest that the union has in enforcing

12

the entire election procedure.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Pierson, I — do you -- is it

14

your position that it's not even a close question, that

15

the language couldn't be interpreted the way Mr. Brown

16

wants to interpret it?

17

MR. PIERSON:

18

QUESTION:

The language of the statute?

Yes.

I mean, it does say all

19

reasonable requests.

20

reasonable requests of any candidate, and the difference

21

is you say that means reasonable in light of the union

22

rules, and Brown says it means just all reasonable

23

requests, union rules or not.

24

your interpretation is plausible.

even plausible?

It just says shall comply with all

I'm leading you, if it is plausible —

2

MR. PIERSON:

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

I appreciate that.

— why shouldn't we take the

5

Secretary's interpretation, which I — which I gather has

6

been consistent, and why shouldn't we simply apply Chevron

7

to his interpretation of this provision?

8
9

MR. .PIERSON:

Well that requires us to answer

the question of what is the Secretary's interpretation.

10

The Secretary wrote a letter at respondent's request

11

concerning the request that was made in this case.

12

letter was not necessarily compelled or required by

13

anything that's in the Secretary's regulations.

14

the Secretary's regulations simply say that a union may

is

not adopt a rule forbidding all requests.

16

seems apparent from the express language of the statute

17

itself that the union must grant reasonable requests.

18

That the union should give advance notice to all

19

candidates of the conditions under which distribution

20

should be made — will be made, which we submit furthers

21

the idea of having a rule in order to give advance notice,

22

and provides certain things regarding bona fide

23

candidates, which regulation is based upon the Yablonski

24

case, in which Yablonski needed the support of people in

25

order to be nominated.

That

In fact,

may determine the policies underlying the statute, and

13

those policies have been determined and applied and

with Calhoon v. Harvey, continuing through the Glass

Bottle Blowers case, and all the way up through Sadlowski.

The competing policies of LMRDA are clear.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pierson, one of the points made

21

on the other side was that Mr. Brown wanted other

potential candidates to know in advance that he was

serious in running himself, so that others in effect might

stand by and not declare themselves, as long as they knew

that we need fact finding for that purpose.

10

MR. PIERSON:

It seems to me that it also could

11

be said that any rule that places any restriction upon the

right to distribute literature could favor incumbents.

13

you take respondent's argument to its greatest extent,

14

which is done in one of the amicus briefs, I think, any

15

rule that would prevent an incumbent from distributing

effect that might favor incumbents.

Our position is we start with whether the rule

is reasonable or unreasonable, and then it's up to the

candidate to make some showing, a factual showing, that

the rule either was adopted for the purpose of favoring

incumbents, or that the rule has the effect of inhibiting

democracy within the union, or that there is something

QUESTION:

Mr. Pierson, you carefully leave out

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL ALAN LEVY

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LEVY:

5
6
7

Mr. Levy,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question here is this.

In deciding whether

8

a union has satisfied its statutory duty to, in the words

9

of section 401(c), comply with all reasonable requests

10

from any candidate to mail campaign literature at the

11

candidate's own expense, should a court focus, as the

12

lower courts did and as the Secretary of Labor agrees they

13

should, on the question whether the request itself is

14

reasonable in light of all the circumstances, or does the

15

case stand or fall on a determination of whether the

16

request satisfies a union rule, and whether that union

17

rule is reasonable in its general application.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, in your first suggestion as

19

to how the rule should be — the statute should be

20

interpreted, you say that is the request reasonable in the

21

light of all the circumstances.

22

circumstances be the existence of the union rule?

23

MR. LEVY:

Would one of the

I think there are circumstances in

24

which the existence of a union rule is something that it

25

would be useful for the court to consider, and indeed,

1

although the district court focused squarely on the

2

reasonableness of the union rule, even the court of

3

appeals took note of the union rule and also noted that it

4

had an adverse effect on the ability of insurgents to run

5

for office.

6

QUESTION:

I mean, supposing there's a request

7

for literature distribution as of July 1, and the union

8

rule says we're not going to distribute any until July 10,

9

and the election is a year away.

10

That might affect the

reasonableness of the request, might it not?
MR. LEVY:

11

I don't know that the existence of

12

the rule would affect the reasonableness of the request.

13

It may be that one would look to the circumstance of how

14

far away the election is in determining the reasonableness

15

of the rule, the reasonableness of the request, although I

16

would say, I would argue that the fact that the election

17

is a year away would not necessarily make the request

18

unreasonable, regardless of the existence of the union

19

rule.

20

question, that the mere existence of a union rule on that

21

question would provide much if any assistance to the court

22

in deciding whether the rule was reasonable.

for a time limit, then that would be all right too?
MR. LEVY:

No, our position is this.

That if

the union can point to particular administrative burdens

which have to be satisfied with respect to any rule, I

5

would not have the Court let the union decide whether

6

there are such administrative burdens.

me, is a question for the Court to decide itself in

8

judging the reasonableness of the request.

9

That, it seems to

But if we hypothesize that there's an

10

administrative burden, for example, an amount of time to

11

put out a mailing, so that the union says we need a

13

way we are going to deal with the administrative burden,

14

and there are a variety of ways we can deal with the

we may be able to solve — resolve this case on the record

2

as it is, but if there are factual conflicts we reserve

3

the right to put on evidence.

4

that fact, it never disputed the fact that the union, the

5

incumbents had used the union newspaper, not abused it,

6

just used the union newspaper to communicate their views

7

and exclude the views of others.

8
9

The union never disputed

So we don't think that to the extent that the
Court finds it necessary to get to the question of whether

10

the rule is reasonable, we don't think that the state of

11

the record is a bar to the Court's deciding the case on

12

13

The union also, although Mr. Pierson, I don't

14

know whether he finally answered your question.

15

certainly attempted to equivocate in answer to Justice

1

parts of the statute which do refer to reasonable union

2

rules and which subject rights to reasonable union rules.

3

Congress chose not to do so here.

4

The union makes a variety of arguments about why

5

it would be a good idea to focus on the reasonableness of

6

the union's rules, but the fundamental objection to that

7

argument is that that is not what Congress said to do.

8

And what they .really want the Court to do is to rewrite

9

the statute in that respect.

10

Moreover, focusing on the reasonableness of the

11

request rather than on the union's rule is also supported

12

by Congress' purpose in passing this part of the statute.

13

Congress recognized that union candidates have special

14

problems in communicating with the voters, and it enacted

section 401(c) to help candidates overcome those

disadvantages.

1

MR. LEVY:

As we argued in opposing cert in this

2

case, this case can be disposed of on the ground that it

3

is a patently unreasonable rule, and maybe you should wait

4

for a better case to decide this question of whether you

5

look at the reasonableness of the rule or the

6

reasonableness of the request.

7

But the points I am making also go to the

8

question of how you should construe the statute.

What

9

we're arguing is that because section 401(c) was a remedy

10

for the problem that I have just described, it should be

11

construed in a way which helps to even the playing field.

12

Adoption of the union's approach, we submit, would make it

13

far more difficult for union members to exercise the right

14

to do campaign mailings.

15

that is so.

16

And there are three reasons why

First, the union concedes that its approach

17

establishes a presumption that the union's rule is proper,

18

and it is up to the candidate to establish that the

19

union's rule is unreasonable.

20

approach, which they set forth in their reply brief at

21

page 11, some requests which are otherwise reasonable

22

could be denied because the union has a rule which is

23

reasonable in its general application.

24

particular candidate has particular needs could not be

25

considered.

So under the union's rule,

And so the question is whose interests should

In the close cases, whose interests should

And what we argue is that because it is so clear
that this part of the statute was meant to favor

10

challengers by providing them with a vital means for

overcoming the advantages of incumbency,

12

Now, does that, in your view, enable unions to establish a
range of conditions that have to be considered in
evaluating the reasonableness of a request?
Some of them might include the things mentioned
by the Chief Justice, for instance, 2 days' notice so we
can assemble a list, or, as Justice Scalia suggested, in
writing.

And maybe another could be payment in cash in

advance of the mailing of the cost that we determine it
will entail.

Now, are those things subject to union rule,

if you will?

And must those things be considered in

evaluating the reasonableness of the candidate's request?
MR. LEVY:
ways.

Let me answer that question in two

First with respect to how I understand the

Secretary's rule and, second, a more general response.
I understand the Secretary's regulation to say
that unions, to the extent that they have established
procedure, should provide notice of those procedures.

But

the Secretary does not anticipate fixed, unchanging rules,
because the very same regulation says, and if you change
the procedures, be sure you send out notice.

So it

doesn't -- the Secretary obviously doesn't anticipate a
fixed, unchanging rule, but rather procedures -QUESTION:

Well, that might mean if you change

your rule, let us know.
MR. LEVY:

The second point -- the second point

3

is that, with respect to the kinds of procedures or rules,

4

if you were, that you are describing, those kinds of

5

rules, because they deal with administrative burdens which

6

have to be handled some way in connection with any

7

request, given the statutory, for example, requirement of

8

payment for the mailing, my arguments about adopting a

9

non-deference to the union rule approach because it would

10

disserve the purpose of the statute would not apply to

11

those kinds of rules.

12

says you simply can't, no matter how much notice you give

13

us, do a mailing at a certain amount of time before, more

14

than, say, 10 days before the ballots go out, or the few

15

days which are allowed by the current union rule.

16

respect to that kind of rule, the argument that I make

17

fully applies.

But with respect to the rule which

With-

I don't know if I --

19

The second problem with the union's approach is

20

that every time a union member wanted to challenge the

21

denial of a mailing request he would have to show that the

22

union's system with respect to mailing requests as a whole

23

was unreasonable, or he would have to show that the rule

24

had been misapplied, subject, at least according to the

25

union, to the rule that you defer to the incumbent's

interpretation of their own constitution.
Now, especially because the union member has to

2

3

hire his own lawyer — the union, of course, is defended

4

by union counsel at union expense — it would be very

5

difficult to make that kind of proof in the context of a

6

preliminary injunction hearing, with the election looming,

7

these burdens would make it difficult, in our judgment,

8

for the court .to, in Senator Javitz's words, act and act

9

in time, except in the most egregious of cases, which

10

again, I would emphasize we think this is.
So that's another way in which the union's

11
12

approach, focusing on the reasonableness of the rule,

13

disserves Congress' purpose of helping challengers to make

14

mailing requests when they need them.

15

QUESTION:

You would rather have the challenger

fight each request case by case instead of being able to

your remarks you will tell us exactly what it is we need

2

to defer to the Secretary on, and whether there is room in

requests will be made in writing, they will be made 2 days

- you will have to pay us in cash or postal money order,

7

or something of that sort, in advance.
MR. .FELDMAN:

8

9

question first.

Okay, let me take the first

The Secretary's view that the focus of

10

the statute, as the statutory language indicates, is on

11

the reasonableness of the request, is a consistent view

12

that, as the materials that we have lodged with the Court

13

show, dates back as long as 1960.

14

that time the particular issue of whether a -reasonable

15

rule can trump an otherwise reasonable request had not yet

16

arisen.

17

Now, it's true that at

But when that particular application of the

18

general principle arose, starting in the mid-1980's, the

19

Secretary took the position, for instance in the Third

20

Circuit Donovan against Carpenter's case, that the issue,

21

the ultimate issue, the one and only test that section

22

401(c) imposes is whether the rule -- is whether the

23

request is reasonable.

24

basis of letters that the Secretary wrote in this case and

25

the briefs that we filed in this Court.

And then it indeed formed the

Now that position — really the only substantial

1

2

argument that that is not a clear position is that there

3

is another regulation, 29 CFR 452.67, that says, quote,

4

"It is advised that a union inform all candidates in

5

advance of the conditions under which distribution will be

6

made."

First of all, that doesn't speak specifically of

7

rules.

And secondly, the purpose of having unions give

8

such advice to candidates, it can serve a number of

9

different functions under the statute.

For one thing, and

10

I think that's extremely important, it can provide a safe

11

harbor to everybody involved to know under what

12

circumstances a candidate can get —
QUESTION:

13

Well, the fact is it's desirable for

14

everyone to know requests have to be made in writing or

15

not, they have to be accompanied by payment or not, they

16

have to give at least X number of days' or hours' notice

17

or not.

That's important, isn't it?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

2

fact, in that case the candidate reasonably wouldn't rely

3

on getting his mailing done during that period and the

4

request may be unreasonable.

5

the rule can serve the function of publicizing a condition

So the union can serve --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. MICHEL PIERSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. PIERSON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

The argument in the district court in this case,

5

it is clear from a review of the transcript, proceeded

6

solely upon the legal question of how to determine whether

7

a request was reasonable, that is by reference to the rule

8

or otherwise. , And in fact, the first thing that the union

9

tried to show at the time of the hearing was that

10

respondent had made other communications with the

11

membership and had other channels of communication, and

12

then the case immediately went off on the discussion of

13

how to construe the statute.
We therefore submit that if this Court should

14
15

agree with our position a remand is necessary, and that

16

this Court cannot determine the reasonableness of this

17

rule upon the face of this record.

18

With respect to the test in terms of the statute

19

itself, it seems to me that two things are apparent.

20

Number one that, and I do not mean to equivocate in answer

21

to a question, but the argument that there is an

22

intersection between reasonable rules and reasonable

23

requests, and that applying the union's approach will

24

result in the denial of reasonable requests because of the

25

rule, really is not the way that the section intends.

1

What I mean is this, that it is impossible to determine

2

whether a request is reasonable or unreasonable without

3

looking at the context of the union's election procedure,

4

and therefore it is meaningless to talk about whether a

5

rule is reasonable in the abstract.

he said I find per se that this request is reasonable.
