ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICKIE LEON PEARSON

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT KENTUCKY
MR. PEARSON:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1986 Illinois filed a complaint against the

10
11

Commonwealth of Kentucky in this original action.

12

complaint Illinois alleged that Kentucky had directly

13

infringed upon its sovereignty by exercising its boating

14

and fishing laws north of the 1792 low-water mark on the

15

northwestern side of the Ohio River.

16

And prior to that action there had never been any

In the answer Kentucky denied that it had

22

directly infringed upon Illinois' sovereignty.

23

Kentucky asserted that its boundary on the Ohio River is

24

the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river

25

as it exists from time to time.

Instead,

current low-water mark.

raised two affirmative defenses, one affirmative defense
3

being that of acquiescence, the second affirmative defense

4

being that of latches.

5

Kentucky raised the defense of acquiescence

6

because it wanted to invoke and employ the basic teachings

7

of Georgia v. South Carolina, and that is Kentucky wanted

8

to maintain, and to this day wants to maintain, the status

9

quo on the river.

Kentucky submits that the boundary

10

between the two States, as it has been for 168 years, is

11

the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river.

12

Also in the answer Kentucky-

By bringing the complaint, Illinois in essence

13

seeks to change this boundary and make it the 1792 low-

14

water mark.

That's correct.

Not the 1792 low-

water mark, but the prevailing, current low-water mark.

Mr. Pearson, are you asking us to

Illinois Enabling Act, the 1818 constitution of Illinois,
the 1848 constitution of Illinois, and the 1870

3

constitution of Illinois.

All these documents, when

4

viewed, conclude that the boundary between Illinois and

5

Kentucky is the low-water mark, as those documents put it,

6

along the northwestern shore, meaning the bank.

7

Perhaps maybe the most important notification

8

that Kentucky had with respect to the low-water mark on

9

the northwestern side of the river came from an 1849

10

report of the Illinois Joint Select Committee to

11

investigate Illinois' boundary on the Ohio River.

12

legislative body concluded that the boundary between

13

Illinois and Kentucky is the low-water mark on the

14

northwestern side of the river.

15

Kentucky submits that the conclusion of the

16

Joint Select Committee from Illinois is in keeping with

17

the 1820 case of Handly's Lessee v. Anthony.

18

Anthony case the court was called upon for the first time

19

to construe the 1784 Virginia Deed of Cession which gave

20

lands to the United States of America, and thereby created

21

Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

22

In the

In construing the 1784 cession, the court in

Secondly, it was an

With that in mind, Kentucky submits that by

8

using the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the

9

river as it exists from time to time, or currently, or as

10

it prevails, is the most practical approach to resolving

11

the boundary dispute.

12

QUESTION:

After all -Mr. Pearson, if you're not asking the

13

Court to overrule Ohio against Kentucky, then your

14

argument has to be based on acquiescence, does it not?

15

MR. PEARSON:

16

QUESTION:

It does, Your Honor.

And how much of a part does the

17

practicalities of the thing play in acquiescence?

18

don't you have to show that Illinois consented to this

19

boundary, basically?

20
21
22

MR. PEARSON:

You do.

You have to show that

they acquiesced in this particular boundary.
QUESTION:

You sure do.

And if they acquiesced, what

23

difference does it make whether it's a practical boundary?

24

And if they didn't acquiesce, what difference does it make

25

whether it's a practical boundary?

16

that the area located on that construction plan was about

as close enough to the theoretical line as it could be.

13

Kentucky had that 1936 plan analyzed by one of

its bridge engineers and of course that plan indicated

15

that the boundary was at Pier B, Station 20 plus 10.

authority under Kentucky's 1810 statute, and the case law

that has interpreted it, to lease the river bed to the

thread or the middle of the stream.

7

For instance, Kentucky counties that

As a result of that subsequent decisions by the

8

Supreme Court of Kentucky, or the highest court in

9

Kentucky at that time, concluded that the State of

10

Kentucky likewise has the authority to lease the bed of

11

the river from the middle of the stream to the low-water

12

mark on the northwestern side of the river.

13

And that's exactly what Kentucky has done.

14

Before the Special Master there is evidence that Kentucky

15

has entered into agreements with private companies for the

16

leasing of the river bed for dredging of sand and gravel.

Indiana.

— Indiana as well.
That's correct.

And so I assume if somehow we were to

agree with you that there has been acquiescence here for

the Illinois boundary, that would mean the boundary is

25

someplace else with respect to Indiana and Ohio?

That's correct.

In other words,

if I understand your question, it would create an

inconsistent boundary.

QUESTION:

5

MR. PEARSON:

Yes, quite.
With respect to that conclusion --

6

which it would.

It would create an inconsistent boundary.

7

But there are some factors to be concerned.

8

the bright-line principle that would allow Kentucky to

9

fashion the boundary as it argues today, which has been

10

recognized for 168 years, is California v. Nevada.

11

think the bright-line principle in that case is that there

12

is no particular relationship between the origins of a

13

boundary and the legal consequences of acquiescence in

14

that boundary.

15

I

In other words, for 168 years it has been no

16

problem between Illinois and Kentucky.

17

today, the boundary on the river which the parties or the

18

people who work on that river recognize, is the low-water

19

mark.

20

even though it has been different than the 1792 low-water

21

mark.

22

Even as I speak

We haven't had any problems with it for 168 years,

I think the — at present the Kentucky

23

legislature, with respect to promulgating in its revised

24

statutes the description of the boundary now, talks in

25

terms of allowing the low-water mark on the north side of

the river to intersect with the present 1792 low-water

2

mark as we know it from Ohio v. Kentucky, and of course

3

Kentucky v. Indiana.

4

there has been no problem up until this lawsuit was filed

5

regarding the boundary between the two States.

Merely, the point being is that

At present Kentucky enforces its boating and

7

fishing laws on the entire river to the northwestern side

8

of the river at the low-water mark.

you're speaking with respect to a survey that was done by

2

Illinois with respect to that.

3

concede that that is possible or that is the case.

4

don't -- we don't know the impact with respect to what

5

dams have done to the river and perhaps that issue might

6

be premature and be appropriate if this Court concludes

7

that Kentucky does not prevail.

QUESTION:

We don't -- we cannot
We

No, my point is that all this

activity rely on -- say Illinois allowed all the policing

10

and what went on on the water itself.

11

that was part of Kentucky because they don't really know

12

exactly where the 1792 boundary is.

13

MR. PEARSON:

Maybe they assumed

That may well be true, Your Honor,

14

but in the complaint they allege that it was the 1792 low-

15

water mark.

16

I have to take them --

Right, but I'm just saying if you

don't know where it is, conceivably -- I don't know, I

don't know anything about the geography.

you're talking about basically the principles of accretion

2

168 years in which to bring this action, that it has in

essence acquiesced likewise to the application of the

principles of accretion and erosion.
QUESTION:

5

In other --

If I didn't know where the 1792 low-

water mark was, I guess I would just operate on the

7

assumption that it was where it is now, and therefore my

8

operating on that assumption would not demonstrate any

9

acquiescence whatever.

It would demonstrate only a

10

mistake of fact, perhaps.

11

an acquiescence in the legal principle, right, not just in

12

a fact, but in the legal principle.

13

MR. PEARSON:

I mean, you have to demonstrate

And I think we have with respect

to inaction for a long period of time.

QUESTION:

Well, how does —

That's one of the considerations.

How would it hurt Kentucky?

MR. PEARSON:

8

predicate on the assumption.

9

low-water mark as Illinois alleges in its brief, which

10

means that the boundary is no longer the shoreline but

11

moves out into the waterway, then obviously because of the

12

geographical location of that boundary which Illinois says

13

is the boundary between the two States, we're going to

14

give up some of the river.

To give you another example as to how Kentucky

has exercised dominion and control over the river, from

1946 to 1988 Kentucky had a special license called the

license was purchased exclusively and available only for

residents of Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana.

10
11

This

We sold it

exclusively to them so they could fish the Ohio River.
In 1988 the regulations were amended such that

Kentucky would then have a new license called a

13

nonresident fishing license, meaning that Illinois

14

residents could purchase the license, just like any other

15

resident of a — from a State other than Kentucky.

but in either case Kentucky was selling those licenses

particularly to Illinois official -- Illinois individuals

I do know that when you look at the

Another source that -- another Kentucky source

19

recognizing the 1792 line was the 1963 attorney general's

20

opinion where the Kentucky Attorney General not only

21

recognized the existence, or the accuracy of the 1792 low-

22

water mark as Kentucky's boundary, he also recognized that

because of the dams it would be south of the contemporary

northern shoreline due to the general raising of the

river.

The final two Kentucky sources that contain

1
2

statements incompatible with Kentucky's position here are

3

their two bulletins issued in 1969 and 1972 by the Special

4

Ohio River Boundary Subcommittee of the Kentucky

5

Legislative Research Commission.

6

forward to the first of those bulletins, Bulletin 81,

7

tells us that this special subcommittee was created

8

specifically to study Kentucky's Ohio River boundary due

9

to litigation during the preceding 150 years.

The introduction or

I think it's significant to note that despite

10
11

Kentucky's claim here that it has always asserted its

12

boundary to be the low-water mark as exists from time to

13

time, that claim was somehow lost on the authors of this

14

-- these bulletins, since neither one of those bulletins

15

advanced such a claim on Kentucky's behalf, and both of

16

them recognize the 1792 low-water mark.

17

So, based on those sources running from 1890

18

through 1972, and those two reports were even issued while

19

Ohio v. Kentucky was pending in this Court, it shows to me

20

first that Kentucky has repeatedly recognized the 1792

21

line.

22

confusion within Kentucky, because the legislative

23

research commission was saying it's the 1792 line,

24

Kentucky in their answer to Ohio's original complaint said

25

no, it isn't.

Also that — oh, that's true, there was also

34

1

And again, that kind of uncertainty and

2

confusion, I think, fits Illinois' position in this case

3

because you don't have acquiescence where the State

4

claiming the benefit of it can't show a longstanding

5

continuous claim to the boundary they are seeking to have

6

the Court adopt.

7

There is additional evidence in the record, I

8

think, also that shows that this uncertainty extends to

9

both States.

The best evidence of that concerns the

10

taxation of the permanent structures.

11

of structures built on the Illinois shore that extend into

12

the river, barge loading facilities, coal loading

13

facilities, that sort of thing.

14

these structures, and admittedly we could produce evidence

15

that we were definitely taxing only one of them.

16

part of a grain-loading facility that is located in

17

Alexander County, Illinois.

18

There are a number

Illinois identified 15 of

That was

Kentucky of course argued this shows that they

19

have exercised exclusive jurisdiction over the river,

20

Illinois hasn't.

21

Kentucky, too, has only taxed one of these 15 structures.

22

So really what you have, 13 out of 15 structures aren't

23

being taxed by either State.

But in fact the record also shows that

24

Kentucky did try to tax a second one --

25

QUESTION:

I bet they're paying taxes now.

(Laughter.)

2

MR. BRUNSMAN:

3

They're waiting, holding their

breath.

4

Kentucky did try to tax a second structure, but

5

the taxpayer there protested on the grounds that they felt

6

that the whole thing was in Illinois and not in Kentucky.

7

And taxation I think is one of the factors the Court has

8

traditionally looked at in these acquiescence cases, and

9

here I think it supports a conclusion that the record

10

shows uncertainty in both States, and that's incompatible

11

with a finding of acquiescence.

12

Another example --

13

QUESTION:

14

What is the -- is the water above

these dams heavily used for recreation?

15

I don't believe it is, Your

QUESTION:

MR. BRUNSMAN:

(Laughter.)

5

MR. BRUNSMAN:

What do they get?

Catfish?

I have no idea, Your Honor.

Another incident that Mr. Pearson

6

talked about was the -- had to do with the coroners.

7

he mentioned the situation where the Illinois coroner

8

always asks permission before he takes charge of a

9

drowning victim in the river.

And

While it happens to be the

10

coroner in Hardin County, Illinois, it is certainly true

11

that he has always done so.

12

Kentucky coroner has always given his permission, even in

13

the most recent incident where the victim was still in the

14

river when the Kentucky coroner arrived on the scene.

But it's also true that the

15

And I would submit again this reflects

16

uncertainty in both States, since Kentucky doesn't suggest

17

how one of its coroners could legally delegate authority

18

over a death occurring in the Commonwealth to an Illinois

19

official.

20

do exactly, so they work this out between themselves.

Plainly it's just neither of them knows what to

There is a similar arrangement that was in

21
22

existence for a long time between the Gallatin County,

23

Illinois coroners and their counterpart.

Illinois.

So again, I think these sorts of situations fall

1

2

far short of what normally takes and what this Court has

3

found in the past it takes to establish a new boundary by

4

means of acquiescence or prescription.

Finally, I'd like to discuss briefly the various

5
6

instances where Illinois has exercised jurisdiction over

7

part of the river.

8

permits Illinois' Department of Transportation has issued

9

over the last 69 years governing a variety of structures

One example of this are the, some 78

10

built from the Illinois shore south into the river.

And

11

these permits were issued pursuant to a statute that

12

requires such a permit for anyone who wishes to do any

13

construction within the public bodies of water of

14

Illinois.

15

Department of Transportation is clear assertion that it

16

believed some part of the waters of the Ohio were within

17

Illinois, or it wouldn't have been issuing these permits

18

for the last 69 years.

And I would submit that the actions of the

19

Kentucky of course says that Illinois has never

20

exercised any jurisdiction on the water, and this I think

21

proves that that --

22

QUESTION:

23

deference to what the Master found?

25

Do you think we ought to give some

QUESTION:

1

Well, I suppose you would.

But do

2

you find any evidence in the -- in our original case

3

opinions that if it's a tie the vote goes to the Special

4

Master?
MR. BRUNSMAN:

5

Your Honor, I think the Court has

6

said that although the Special Master's findings are

7

entitled to respect and a tacit presumption of

8

correctness, the Court nonetheless has to make an

9

independent review of each record in an original action,

10

since it's really this Court and not the Special Master

11

who is —

12

QUESTION:

That's quite inconsistent, isn't it,

13

to say that there's a presumption but we do it

14

independently?

15
16

MR. BRUNSMAN:

repeat what I have read in the cases.

I'd like you to rely heavily on

the tacit presumption of correctness and --

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. BRUNSMAN:

Another example of Illinois'

24

assertion of jurisdiction over the river has to do with

25

the 1927 decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the

argument.

It cited Indiana v. Kentucky for the

10

proposition that the boundary was the low-water mark on

11

the northwest side of the river.

12

observed that no commission between the States had ever

actually plotted that line, and that the dispute before it

14

really wasn't the proper vehicle for resolving an

15

interstate boundary dispute.

16

But then it also

What it did, it was however able to resolve the

controversy because it concluded that the low-water mark

referred to in Indiana v. Kentucky was the record low-

water mark at any given point along the river.

words, each time the river got lower the boundary moved

further south.

In other

I would submit that that --

QUESTION:

MR. BRUNSMAN:

applied that rule in this case it's clear that it didn't

contemplate the boundary ever moving back.

has not acquiesced to the less favorable line that

3

Kentucky claims in this case.

4

I would submit that that alone shows that Illinois

So in summing up, Illinois' position in this

5

case is first of all, of course, that the boundary between

6

Illinois and Kentucky is controlled by the prior decisions

7

of this Court in Ohio v. Kentucky and Indiana v. Kentucky.

8

It should be the 1792 low-water mark.

9

of acquiescence fails, I believe, first because Kentucky

Kentucky's defense

10

authorities themselves have repeatedly recognized the 1792

11

low-water mark, and that is -- you can juxtapose that to

12

the fact that there is not a single witness or document in

13

the record that says — that Kentucky can point to that

14

says it's the low-water mark as exists from time to time.

15

That, those words appear in the pleadings before this

16

Court, and nowhere else that I am aware of.

17

In addition, Illinois rely on the fact that

18

there is evidence of confusion in both States, and once

19

again that's incompatible with a finding of acquiescence

20

based on a continuous claim of right.

21

Finally, Kentucky has based its argument in part

22

on the suggestion that Illinois has never exercised any

23

jurisdiction on the river.

24

the record at least as concrete as those Kentucky can

25

point to to show that we have exercised jurisdiction over

And that all of those factors add up to a situation where

3

you simply do not have acquiescence.

If the Court has no further questions, that's
all I have.
