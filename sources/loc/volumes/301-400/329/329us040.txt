treaties negotiated with Indian tribes in the Territory of
Oregon.

Four of the tribes,2 the Tillamooks, Coquilles, Too-tooto-neys and Chetcos, successfully identified themselves as
entitled to sue under the Act, proved their original Indian
title 3 to designated lands, and demonstrated an involuntary and uncompensated taking of such lands.

The Court

of Claims thereupon held that original Indian title was
an interest the taking of which without the consent of the
Indian tribes entitled them to compensation. In answer

to government contentios that original Indian title, in
the absence of some form of official "recognition," could
be appropriated without liability upon the part of the
sovereign, the Act of 1848,' establishing the Territory of

'Oregon, was citedby the Court of Claims as affording any
recognition required to support the claim for compensation. The issues decided, not previously passed upon by
this Court and being of importance to the administration
of Indian affairs, prompted this Court to grant certiorari.
The case was argued during the 1945 term and on April 1,
1946, was restored to the docket for reargument before

a full bench.

The remaining seven plaintiff tribes failed to state a cause of action
under the jurisdictional act and the rules of the Court of Claims.

impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians
in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by
treaty between the United States and such Indians, or to affect the
authority of the government of the United States to make any regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights, by
treaty, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to the
government to make if this act had ziever passed . ..

VINSON,

C. J.

The events giving rise to the claims here occurred as part
of the opening and development of the Territory of
Oregon. After creating a government for that territory
by the Act of-1848,1 Congress in 1850 authorized the negotiation of treaties with Indian tribes in the area. Under the
latter Act,' Anson Dart, later succeeded by General Joel
Palmer, was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs
for the Oregon region and was instructed to negotiate
treaties for the extinguishment of Indian claims to lands
in that district. On August 11, 1855, Palmer and respondent tribes concluded a treaty providing for the cession of
Indian lands in return for certain money payments and
the creation of a reservation. The treaty was to be operative only upon ratification. It was not submitted to the
Senate until February, 1857, and was never ratified.
Pending expected ratification, and following recommendations from Palmer, the President on November-9,
1855, created a reservation, subject to future diminution
and 9most identical with that provided for in the treaty.
A large part of this reservation, called the Coast or Siletz
Reservation, consisted of lands to which the Tillamook
Tribe held original Indian title. Almost immediately the
Tillamooks were confined to that portion of their land
within the reservation, and the other three respondent
tribes, as well as other tribes, were moved from their original possessions to the reservation. In 1865 an Executive
Order reduced the size of the reservation; in 1875 Congress
by statute approved the Executive Orders of 1855 and
1865, and in order to open more land for public settlement,
removed add4jinal land from the reservation. By an Act
of 1894,/'Congress officially accepted and approved the res9 Stat. 323.

ervation as it then existed, and thenceforward did not take
reservation lands without compensation.
The claims of respondent tribes are for the wrongful.
taking which occurred when they were deprived of their
original possessions by the Executive Order of November
9, 1855. Even as to the Tillamooks, the Court of Claims
found the taking complete as of November 9, 1855, since
this tribe was forced to share its former lands with other
Indians, and since the reservation was, in any event, only
a conditional one, subject to being opened for public settlement at the will of the President. Petitioner disputes
neither this finding nor the proof of original Indian title as
of 1855.
Other than the .benefits flowing from the Act of 1894,
none of the four respondent tribes has received any compensation for the loss of its lands. Until the present jurisdictional act of 1935, these tribes, lacking consent of the
United States to be sued, were forbidden access to the
courts. They alone of the tribes with whom Dart and
Palmer negotiated some twenty-odd treaties between 1850
and 1855 have yet to receive recognition for the loss of
lands held by original Indian title.'
Until now this Court has had no opportunity or occasion
to pass upon the precise issue presented here. In only one
Act prior to 1935 has Congress authorized judicial determination of the right to recover for a taking of nothing
more than original Indian title; and no case under that
.828 Stat. 286, 323.
9 In 1851 Dart and Palmer negotiated treaties with nineteen tribes
other than respondents. None of these treaties was ratified; but
twelve of the nineteen tribes were included in further treaties made in
1853, 1854, and 1855, and Congress in 1897 and 1912 provided for
paying the remaining seven tribes for their lands taken under the
unratified treaties.

Act,1" passed in 1929, reached this Court.11 In 19301 Congress again authorized adjudication of Indian claims arising out of original Indian title, but expressly directed an
award of damages if a taking of lands held by immemorial
possession were shown. This Act thus eliminated any
judicial determination of a right to recover, once original
Indian title was established.
Prior to 1929, adjudications of Indian claims against the
United States were limited to issues arising out of treaties,
statutes, or other events and transactions carefully designated by Congress. This Court has always strictly construed such jurisdictional acts and has not offered judicial opinion on the justness of the handling of Indian lands,
except in so far as Congress in specific language has
permitted its justiciable recognition.
The language of the 1935 Act is specific, and its consequences are clear. By this Act Congress neither admitted
nor denied liability. The Act removes the impediments
of sovereign immunity and lapse of time and provides for
judicial determination of the designated claims. No new
right or cause of action is created. A merely moral claim
is not made.a legal one. The cases are to be heard on their
merits and decided according to legal principles pertinent

tion of the legal and equitable claims glio .ing out of original Indian title. That which was within the power of
Congress to withhold from judicial scrutiny has now been
submitted to the courts. If, as has many times been said, 1'
the-manner of extinguishing Indian title is usually a political question and presents a non-justiciable issue, Congress
has expressly and effectively directed otherwise by seeking
in the 1935 Act judicial disposition of claims arising from
original Indian title. "By consenting to be sued, and submitting the decision to judicial action, they have considered it as a purely judicial question, which we are now
bound to decide, as between man and man . , ." United
States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 711 (1832).
It has long been held that by virtue of discovery the
title to lands occupied by Indian tribes vested in the
sovereign. " This title was deemed subject to a right of
occupancy in favor of Indian tribes, because of their
original and previous possession. It is with the content of
this right of occupancy, this original Indian title, that we
are concerned here.
As against any but the sovereign, original Indian title
was accorded the protection of complete ownership; 16 but
it was vulnerable to affirmative action by the sovereign,
which possessed exclusive power to extinguish the right
of occupancy at will. Termination of the right by sovereign action was complete and left the land free and clear
of Indian claims. Third parties could not question the
justness or fairness of the methods used to extinguish the
right of occupancy." Nor could-the Indians themselves
prevent a taking of tribal lands or forestall a termination
of their title. However, it is now for the first time asked

Opinion of

VINSON,.C. J.

whether the Indians have a cause of action for compensation arising out of an involuntary taking of lands held by
original Indian title.
We cannot but affirm the decision of the Court of Claims.
-Admitting the undoubted power of Congress to extinguish
original Indian title compels no conclusion that compensation need not be paid. In speaking of the original claims
of the Indians to their lands, Marshall had this to say:
"It' is difficult to comprehend the proposition . . . that
the discovery . . . should give the discoverer rights in the
country discovered, which annulled the pre-existing right
of its ancient possessors. . . . It gave the exclusive right
to purchase, but did not found that right on a denial of the
right of the possessor to sell. . . .. The king purchased
their lands, . . . but never coerced a surrender of them.",
Worcester v.Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 543, 544, 547 (1832). In
our opinion, taking original Indian title without compensation and without consent does not satisfy the "high
standards for fair dealing"-required of the United States in
controlling Indian affairs. United States v. Santa Fe
Pacific R. Co., 314 U. S. 339, 356'(1941). The Indians'
have more than a merely moral claim for compensation.'
A contrary decision would ignore the plain import of
traditional methods of extinguishing original Indian title.
The early acquisition of Indian lands, in the main, progressed by a process of negotiation and treaty. The first
treaties reveal the striking deference paid to Indian claims,
The "moral" obligation upon Congress, of which the cases speak,
refers more to the obligation to open the courts to suit by the Indians.
It does not mean that there is no substantive right in the Indians. So
in United States v. Blackfeather, 155 U. S. 180, 194 (1894) it was held
that, "While there may be a moral obligation, on the part of the
government to reimburse the money embezzled by the Indian superintendent . . .," the jurisdictional act in point did not extend to
such a claim. Yet, given consent to suit, it would hardly be said that
there was no substantive right against the United States for embezzlement of Indian funds.

as the analysis in Worcester v. Georgia, supra, clearly
details. It was usual policy not to coerce the surrender of
lands without consent and without compensation. 9 The
great drive to open Western lands in the 19th Century,
however productive of sharp dealing, did not wholly subvert the settled practice of negotiated extinguishment of
original Indian title.' In 1896, this Court noted that
t... nearly every tribe and band of Indians within the
territorial limits of the United States was under some
treaty relations with the government." Marks v. United
States, 161 U. S. 297, 302 (1896). Something more than
sovereigngrace prompted the obvious regard given to original Indian title.
Long before the end of the treaty system of Indian
government and the advent of legislative control in 1871,'
Congress had evinced its own attitude toward Indian relations. The Ordinance of 1787 declared, "the utmost
good faith shall always be .observed towards the Indians;
their land and property shall never be taken from them
-without their consent . . " 1 Stat. 50, 52. When in
1848 the territorial government of Oregon was created, § 14
ofthat Act ' secured to the inhabitants of the new territory
all the rights and privileges guaranteed by the Ordinance
of 1787. Nor did congressional regard for Indian lands
change in .1871. In providing for the settlement of Dakota
Territory, Congress in 1872directed the extinguishment of
the interests of Indians in certain landsand the determina29

tion of what "compensation ought, in justice and equity,
to be made to said bands . . . for the extinguishment of
whatever title they may have to said lands." 17 Stat. 281;
Buttz v. NorthernPacificRailroad, 119 U. S.55, 59 (1886).
The latest indicia of congressional regard for Indian
claims is the Indian Claims Commission Act, 60 Stat. 1049,
1050, § 2 (5), in which not only are claims similar to those
of the case at bar to be heard, but "claims based upon
fair and honorable dealings that are not recognized by any
existing rule of law or equity" may be submitted to the
Commission with right of judicial review.
Congressional and executive action consistent with the
prevailing idea of non-coercive, compensated extinguishment of Indian title is clear in the facts of the present case.
The Act of 1848 declared a policy of extinguishing Indian
claims in Oregon only by treaty. The statute of 1850 put
in motion the treaty-making machinery.
Respondent
tribes were among those with whom treaties were negotiated. In many cases, expected ratification did not follow.
In the case of respondent tribes alone have no steps been
taken to make amends for the taking of Indian lands pending treaty ratification. To determine now that compensation must be paid is only a fair result.
Petitioner would'admit liability only if, in addition to
clear proof of original Indian title, some act of official
"recognition" were shown.. Original Indian title would
not attain the status of a compensable interest until some
definite act of sovereign acknowledgment followed. Apparently petitioner has seized upon language of the Court
of Claims in Duwamish Indians v. United States, 79 Ct. C1.
-530 (1934), and from it has fashioned a full-blown concept of "recognized Indian title." The jurisdictional act
in that case authorized suits on "all claims of whatsoever
nature, both legal and equitable."

on original Indian title were held to be outside the limits of
the act; and unless a treaty or act of Congtess recognizing
the Indians' title by right of occupancy were shown, recovery could not be had."' A more specific jurisdictional act
was deemed necessary to authorize a suit based upon
original Indian title alone.
Petitioner reads into the Duwamish case far too much.
When the first jurisdictional act specifically allowing suit
on original Indian title in language identical with that of
the 1935 Act later came before the Court' of Claims in
Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United States, 87 Ct. Cl. 143
(1938), the court clearly recognized the specific directives of the act and denied recovery solely because original
Indian title had not been proved. "Recognition" appeared to count only as a possible method of proving
Indian title itself, not as a requisite in addition to proof of
that title. Furthermore, in the case at bar, the unmistakable language of the Court of Claims stands squarely
against the significance petitioner would attach to the
Duwamish decision: "The Duwamish case did not hold or
intend to hold that an Indian tribe could not recover compensation on the basis of original Indian use and occupancy title as for a taking if the jurisdictional act authorized the bringing of a suit and rendition of judgment for
compensation on the basis of such original title." Alcea
Band of Tillamooks v. United States, 103 Ct. Cl. 494, 556,
59 F. Supp. 934 (1945).
Authority for petitioner's position is not found in
Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U. S. 335 (1945).
The jurisdictional act there limited suits to those claims
"arising under or growing out of the treaty of July 2,
1863 . . .5
Suits based upon original Indian title were
not authorized, but we thought a claim would properly
arise under the treaty if it were based upon a taking of

land which the treaty had in any way "recognized" or
acknowledged as belonging to the Indians. The Court
thrice noted that claims based upon original Indian
title were not involved, and made no attempt to settle
controversies brought under other jurisdictional acts authorizing the litigation of claims arising from the taking of
original Indian title.2"
Nor do other cases in this Court lend substance to the
dichotomy of "recognized" and "unrecognized" Indian
title which petitioner urges. Many cases recite the paramount power of Congress to extinguish the Indian right of
occupancy by methods the justice of which "is not open to
inquiry in the courts." United States v. Santa Fe Pacific
R. Co., supra, at 347.2' Lacking a jurisdictional act permitting judicial inquiry, such language cannot be questioned where Indians are seeking payment for appropriated lands; but here in the 1935 statute Congress has
authorized decision by the courts upon claims arising out
of original Indian title. Furthermore, some cases speak of
the unlimited power of Congress to deal with those Indian
lands which are held by what petitioner would call "recog26

Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U. S. 335, 37, 339, 354

(1945).
27 The statements in many cases are directed to disputes between
third parties, one of whom attempts to raise a defect in the other's
title by tracing it to a government grant out of Indian territory and
attacking the power or the method used by the sovereign to convey
Indian lands. Beecher v. Wetherby 1 95 U. S. 517, 525 (1877) ; Buttz v.
Northern Pacific Railroad, 119 U. S.55, 66 (1886) ; Martin v. Waddell,
16 Pet. 367, 409 (1842); Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet.' 195, 201 (1839).
And in other cases, the issue was not the right of Indian tribes
to be compensated for an extinguishment of original Indian title by
the United States. Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U. S.335
(1945); United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314 U.S. 339 (1941);

nized" title;,28 yet it cannot be doubted that, given the
consent of the United States to be sued, recovery may be
had for an involuntary, uncompensated taking of "recognized" title. ' We think the same rule applicable to a taking of original Indian title. "Whether this tract . . . was
properly called a reservation . . . or unceded Indian
country, . . . is a matter of little moment . ... the Indians' right of occupancy has always been held to be
sacred; something not to be taken from him except by
his consent, and then upon such consideration as should
be agreed upon." Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373,
388-89 (1902).2 Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553, 566 (1903); Beecher v.
Wetherby, 95 U. S.517, 525 (1877). The Lone Wolf case was properly assessed in Shoshone Tribe v.United States, 299 U. S.476, 497
(1937): "Power to control and manage the property and affairs of
Indians in good faith for their betterment and welfare may be exerted
in many ways and at times even in derogation of the provisions of a
treaty." See also Oklahoma.v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 592 (1922).
In Barker v. Harvey, 181 U. S. 481 (1901), the Indian claims were
deemed extinguished by non-presentment to the land commission, and
this was true even if the claims had been "recognized" by the Mexican
government priot to the cession of lands to the United States.
29 United States v. Klamath Indians, 304 U. S. 119 (1938); Chippewa Indians v.United States. 301 U. S.358 (1937); Shoshone Tribe
v.United States, 299 U. S.476 (1937) ; United States v. Creek Nation,
295 U. S.103 (1935).
mOther cases also draw no distinction between original Indian title
and "recognized" Indian title. "The Indian title as against the United
States was merely a title and right to the perpetual occupancy of the
land with the privilege of using it in such mode as they saw fit until
such right of occupation had been surrendered to the government.
When Indian reservations were created, either by treaty or executive
order, the Indians held the land by the same character of title; to wit,
the right to. possess and occupy the lands for the uses and purposes
designated." Spalding v. Chandler, 160 U. S.394, 403 (1896). Of
similar tenor is Conley v. Ballinger. 216 U. S.84, 90-91 (1910).
The older cases explaining and giving substance to the Indian right
of occupancy contain no suggestion that only "recognized" Indian title

UNITED STATES v. TILLAMOOKS.

Opinion of

VINSON, C. J.

Requiring formal acknowledgment of original Indian
title as well as proof of that title would nullify the intended consequences of the 1935 Act. The rigors of "recognition," according to petitioner's view, would appear to
require in every case some definite act of the United States
guaranteeing undisturbed, exclusive and perpetual occupancy, which, for example, a treaty or statute could
provide. Yet it was the very absence of such acknowledgment which gave rise to the present statute.
Congress was quite familiar with the precision advisable
when drafting statutes giving jurisdiction to the Court of
Claims in Indian cases. In 1925 an act authorizing the
litigation of any and all claims of certain Indian tribes
was passed. In June, 1934, that act was held, for lack of
specificity, not to extend to claims based on original title. 1
The following year Congress passed the present Act, employing the specific language used once before in the Act
of 1929,32 under which Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United
States, supra, arose. The considered attention given to
the many ramifications of Indian affairs in the 1930's 3
suggests that Congress well realized the import of the
words used in the jurisdictional act of 1935, and that Congress did not expect respondent tribes to be turned out
of court either because congressional power over Indian
title was deemed to have no limits or because there was, as
was obvious to all, no formal guarantee of perpetual and
was being considered. Indeed, the inference is quite otherwise.

Before Congress passed the special Act under which this
suit was brought, I think that the Government was under
no more legal or equitable obligation to pay these respondents than it was under obligation to pay whatever descendants are left of the numerous other tribes whose lands and
homes have been taken from them since the Nation was
founded. See Northwestern Shoshone Indians v. United
States, 324 U. S. 335, 354-358, concurring opinion. It
seems pretty clear to me, however, that Congress in*the
Act of August 26, 1935, 49 Stat. 801, created an obligation
on the part of the Government to pay these Indians for all
lands to which their ancestors held an "original Indian
title." This interpretation of the Act is not only consistent

with the unusually broad language Congress used, but also
fits into the pattern of congressional legislation which has
become progressively more generous in its treatment of
Indians. The capstone of this type of legislation was an
Act passed by the last Congress, which established an
Indian Claims Commission with sweeping powers to pay
old Indian claims growing out of seizure of their lands,
among other things. This Commission is given power to
make awards, subject to review by the Court of Claims,
with and without regard to previous rules of law or equity
courts. The Commission is even given a blanket power to
make awards upon finding, for example, that the land of
Indians was taken by the Government in a way that did
not comport with "fair and honorable dealings." 60 Stat.
1049, 1050, § 2 (5). Since whatever our action here, these
Indians could, I assume, pursue their claims under this
broad recent legislation, and since the language of the
Act before us does not preclude a similarly broad interpretation, I see no reason why it should be otherwise interpreted. This leads me to concur in affirmance of the
judgment.

This case presents directly for the first time in this Court
the question of whether an Indian band is legally entitled
to recover compensation from the United States for the
taking by the Government of the, aboriginal lands of the
Indians when there has been no prior recognition by the
United States through treaty or statute of any title or legal
or equitable right of the Indians in the land. The Court
allows compensation. The importance of the issue persuades us that we should express the reasons for our dissent. It is difficult to foresee the result of this ruling in-the
consideration of claims by Indian tribes against the United
States. We do not know the amount of land so taken.

West of the Mississippi it must be large. Even where
releases of Indian title have been obtained in return for
recognition of Indian rights to smaller areas, charges of
unfair dealings may open up to consideration again legal
or equitable claims for taking aboriginal lands.'
The Court rightly states the effect of the jurisdictional
act in these words:
"The Act removes the impediments of sovereign immunity and lapse of time and provides for judicial
determination of the designated claims. No new
right or cause of action is created. A merely moral
claim is not made a legal one. [Ante, p. 45.] ,
See Indian Claims Commission Act, approved August 13, 1946,
60 Stat. 1049, 1050:
"SEc. 2. The Commission shall hear and determine the following
claims against the United States on behalf of any Indian tribe, band,
or other identifiable group of American Indians residing within the
territorial limits of the United States or Alaska: (1) claims in law or
equity arising under the Constitution, laws, treaties of the United
States, and Executive orders of the President; (2) all other claims in
law or equity, including those sounding in tort,'with respect to which
the claimant would have been entitled to sue in a court of the United
States if the United States was subject to suit; (3) claims which
would result if the treaties, contracts, and agreements between the
claimant and the United States were revised on the ground of fraud,
duress, unconscionable consideration, mutual or unilateral mistake,
whether of law or fact, or any other ground cognizable by a court
of equity; (4) claims arising from the taking by the United States,
whether as the result of a treaty of cession or otherwise, of lands
owned or occupied by the claimant without the payment for such
lands of compensation agreed to by the claimant; and (5) claims
based upon fair and honorable dealings that are not recognized by any
existing rule of law or equity. No claim accruing after the date of
the approval of this Act shall be considered by the Commission.
"All claims hereunder may be heard and determined by the Commission notwithstanding any statute of limitations or laches, but all
other defenses shall be available to the United States."

REED, J., dissenting.

'"Lacking a jurisdictional act permitting judicial inquiry, such language cannot be questioned where
Indians are seeking payment for appropriated lands;
but here in the 1935 statute Congress has authorized
decision by the courts upon claims arising out of original Indian title." [Ante, p. 51.]
This means, and the Court so treats the claims, that the
Indians here get no money by grace or charity or for reasons of honorable dealings with helpless peoples.2 The
recovery by them under this Act will be because they have
had valid claims against the United States on account of
their ouster from these lands in 1855. These Indians
have not been paid the sums owing them, one deduces
from the Court's opinion, because the sovereign, our nation, kept the courts closed to them. The jurisdictional
act, the Court holds, removes this bar to recovery. This
conclusion conflicts with our understanding of this Government's right in the public lands of the nation.
The character of Indian occupancy of tribal lands is at
least of two kinds: first, occupancy as aborigines until that
occupancy is interrupted by governmental order'; and, second, occupancy when by an act of Congress they are given
a definite area as a place upon which to live. When Indians receive recognition of their right to occupy lands by
act of Congress, they have a right of occupancy which cannot be taken from them without compensation.' But by

the other type of occupancy, it may be called Indian title,
the Indians get no right to continue to occupy the lands;
and any interference with their occupancy by the United
Stateshas not heretofore given rise to any right of compensation, legal or equitable.
This distinction between rights from recognized occupancy and from.Indian title springs from the theory under
which the European nations took possession of the lands
of the American aborigines. This theory was that discovery by the Christian nations gave them sovereignty over
and title to the lands discovered. Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8
Wheat. 543, 572-86; 1 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution (5th Ed.) § 152. While Indians were permitted
to occupy these lands under their Indian title,5 the cQnquering nations asserted the right to extinguish that Indian title without legal responsibility to compensate the
Indian for his loss.' It is not for the courts of the conqueror to question the propriety or validity of such an
assertion of power. Indians who continued to occupy
their aboriginal homes, without definite recognition of
their right to do so are like paleface squatters on public
lands without compensable rights if they are evicted..
Tenure for Indian tribes specifically recognized by Congress developed along different lines in the original states,
the Louisiana Purchase, the Mexican Session or the lands
obtained by the Northwest Boundary Treaty. But there
is no instance known to us where there has been intimation
or holding that congressional power to take Indian title
to lands is limited. Whenever the lands to which the
Indians had only Indian title were required for settlement

or public use, the sovereign without legal obligation could
extinguish that title by purchase or the sword.!
In Barker -v.
Harvey, 181 U. S. 481, Mission Indians
claimed a right of permanent occupancy in former Mexican lands ceded to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. They made this claim against a right
arising by virtue of a patent that was issued by the United
States in confirmation of grants by the Mexican Government in derogation of the Indian title. This Court said as
to this Indian title, p. 491, "that a claim of a right to permanent occupancy of land is one of far-reaching effect, and
it could not well be said that lands which were burdened
with a right of permanent occupancy were a part of the
public domain and subject to the full disposal of the
United States." ' This Court confirmed title contrary to
the Indian claim. Rights of occupancy given to Indians
by an executive order may be withdrawn without compensation to the Indians where their title was not recognized
by congressional act. The Indians do not hold such lands
by the same tenure as they do the lands by the terms of a
ratified treaty or statute. Sioux Tribe v. United States,
316 U. S.317, 326-28.
As we understand the present holding of the Court, it
is that the manner of terminating this Indian title by the
United States is limited by the duty to pay compensation.
Therein, we think, lies the fundamental error of the
Court's opinion. It is true that distinctions have been
made between plenary authority over tribal lands and
absolute power, with the suggestion that congressional

power over Indian title was not unlimited. See Cohen,
Handbook of Indian Law, 94, 291, 309, 310, 311. Examination of the authiorities cited, however, will show, 'we
think, in every instance, that where reference is made to
the protection of Indian lands by the Fifth Amendment
or to the legal obligation of the United States to compensate Indians for lands taken, the lands under discussion were lands held by the Indians under titles recognized
by specific acts of Congress.'
When Chief Justice Marshall expounded for the Court
the power of the United States to extinguish Indian title,
this doctrine was laid down for the nation's guidance in
dealing with the Indians:
"The United States, then, have unequivocally acceded to that great and broad rule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They hold,
and' assert in themselves, the title by 'which it was
acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an exclusive right to
extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by
purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right to such
a degree of sovereignty, as the circumstances of the
people.would allow them to exercise.
All our institutions recognise the absolute
title of the crown, subject only to the Indian right of
occupancy, and recognised the absolute title of the
crown to extinguish that right. This is incompatible
with an absolute and complete title in the Indians.
". .. Conquest gives a title which the courts of the
conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and
speculative opinions 'of individuals may be, respecting

the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted ... .
"The title by conquest is acquired and maintained
by force. The conqueror prescribes its limits ...
Where this incorporation is practicable, humanity demands, and a wise policy requires, that the rights of
the conquered to property should remain unimpaired;
that the new subjects should be governed as equitably
as the old, and that confidence in their security should
gradually banish the painful sense of being separated
from their ancient connexions, and united by force
to strangers.
the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country
were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and
whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest.
To leave them in possession of their country, was to
leave the country a wilderness; to govern them as a
distinct people, was impossible, because they were as
brave and as high spirited as they were fierce, and
were ready to repel'by arms every attempt on their
independence.
"What was the inevitable consequence of this state
of things? The Europeans were under the necessity
either of abandoning the country, and relinquishing
their pompous claims to it, or of enforcing those
claims by the sword, and by the adoption of principles
adapted to the condition of a people with whom it was
impossible to mix, and who could not be governed
as a distinct society, or of remaining in their neighbourhood, and exposing themselves and their families
to the perpetual hazard of being massacred.

the white population advanced, that of the Indians
necessarily receded. The country in the immediate
neighbourhood of agriculturists became unfit for
them. The game ffed into thicker and more unbroken forests, and the Indians followed. The soil, to
which the crown originally claimed title, being no
longer occupied by its ancient inhabitants, was parcelled out according to the will of the sovereign
power, and taken possession of by persons who
claimed immediately from the crown, or mediately,
through its grantees or deputies." 8 Wheat.
587-91.
It is unnecessary for this case to undertake at this late
date to weigh the rights and wrongs of this treatment of
aboriginal occupancy. Where injustices have been done
to friendly peoples, Congress has sought to soften their
effect by acts of mercy. Never has there been acknowledgment before of a legal or equitable right to compensation that springs from the appropriation by the United
States of the Indian title.
"Extinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course 'a different matter. The
power of Congress in that regard is supreme. The
manner, method and time of such extinguishment
raise political, not justiciable, issues. Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad,supra, p. 66. As stated by Chief
Justice Marshall in Johnson v. M'Intosh, supra,
p. 586, 'the exclusive right of the United States to
extinguish' Indian title has never been doubted. And
whether it be done by treaty, by the sword,- by purchase, by the exercise of complete dominion adverse
to the right of occupancy, or otherwise, its justness is
not open to inquiry in the courts. Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517, 525." United States v. Santa Fe

The colonies, the states and the nation alike, by their
early legislation, provided, that only the respective sovereigns could extinguish the Indian title."0 The way in
which it was to be extinguished has been held, continually,
a political matter." The jurisdictional act now under
consideration does not purport to change a political matter to a justiciable one.
When this present jurisdictional act was considered by
Congress, nothing in the reports or the debates 2 indicates
that Congress intended to create a new liability because
Indian" title had been taken. This C6urt relies upon no
change of attitude in Congress, but finds that this liability
has always existed and that this act merely removes the
'bat against suit. This we think is contrary to the whole
course of our relations with the Indians.
The Court finds a basis for this action in'that this nation
should not take the Indian title without compensation
because such a taking would not satisfy the "'high standards for fair dealing' required of -the United States in controlling Indian affairs." The language used bythe Court
is taken from United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314
U. S. 339 at 356. It there referred to an act unauthorized
by Congress and not to such takings as here occurred when
Congress opened the original home of these respondents
for settlement.

Therefore Chief Justice Marshall's comments were directed at a situation that does not exist here.
A concurring opinion has been filed which holds that
Congress in the act here involved "created an obligation
on the part of the Government to pay these Indians" for
their Indian title. We do not think this present act is
susceptible of that interpretation. We read the-act, as we
understand our Brethren do, to permit recovery of compensation only in case there were rights in the Indians
prior to its passage "arising under or growing out of the
original Indian title." We think no rights arose from this
Indian title. Therefore no compensation is due.
As we are of the opinion that the jurisdictional act permitted judgment only for claims arising under or growing
out of the original Indian title and are further of the opinion that there were no legal or equitable claims that grew
out of the taking of this Indian title, we would reverse the
judgment of the Court of Claims and direct that the bill
of the respondents should be dismissed. Cf. Shoshone
