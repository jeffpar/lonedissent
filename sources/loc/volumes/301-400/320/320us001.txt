CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 369. Argued April 9, 12, 1943.-Decided June 21, 1943.
1. The broad claims of the Marconi Patent No. 763,772, for improvements in apparatus for wireless telegraphy-briefly, for a structure
and arrangement of four high-frequency circuits with means of
independently adjusting each so that all four may be brought into
electrical resonance with one another-held invalid because
anticipated. P. 38.
Marconi showed no invention over Stone (Patent No, 714,756)
by making the tuning of his antenna circuit adjustable, or by using
Lodge's (Patent No. 609,154) variable inductance for that purpose.
Whether Stone's patent involved invention is not here determined.
2. Merely making a known element of a known combination adjust-

able by a means of adjustment known to the art, when no new or
unexpected result is obtained, is not invention. P. 32.
3. As between two inventors, priority of invention will be awarded
to the one who by satisfying proof can show that he first conceived
of the invention. P. 34.
4. Commercial success achieved by the later inventor and patentee
cannot save his patent from the defense of anticipation by a prior
inventor. P. 35.

5. In the exercise of its appellate power, this Court may consider any
evidence of record which, whether or not called to the attention of
the court below, is relevant to and may affect the correctness of its
decision sustaining or denying any contention which a party has
made before it. P. 44.
6. Although the interlocutory decision of the Court of Claims in this
case that Claim 16 of Marconi Patent No. 763,772 was valid and
infringed was appealable, the decision was not final until the conclusion of the accounting; hence, the court did not lack power at
any time prior to entry of its final judgment at the close of the
accounting to reconsider any portion of its decision and reopen any
part of the case, and it was free in its discretion to grant a reargument based either on all the evidence then of record or only
the evidence before the court when it rendered its interlocutory
decision, or to reopen the case for further evidence. P. 47.
7. The judgment of the Court of Claims holding valid and infringed
Claim 16 of Marconi Patent No. 763,772 is vacated and remanded
in order that that court may determine whether to reconsider its
decision in the light of the Government's present contention that
Claim 16, as construed by the Court of Claims, was anticipated by
the patents to Pupin, No. 640,516, and Fessenden, No. 706,735.
P. 48.
8. A defendant in a patent infringement suit who has added noninfringing and valuable improvements which contributed to the
making of the profits is not liable for benefits resulting from such
improvements. P. 50.
9. Disclosure by publication more than two years before application
for a patent bars any claim for a patent for an invention embodying
the published disclosure. P. 57.
10. Invalidity in part of a patent defeats the entire patent unless the
invalid portion was claimed through inadvertence, accident, or
mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, and is
disclaimed without unreasonable neglect or delay. P. 57.
11. Fleming Patent No. 803,864 held invalid by reason of an improper
disclaimer. P. 58.
The specifications plainly contemplated the use of the claimed
device with low as well as high frequency currents, and the patent
was invalid for want of invention so far as applicable to use with
low frequency currents; the claim was not inadvertent, and the
delay of ten years in making the disclaimer was unreasonable.
12. That the patentee's claim for more than he had invented was
not inadvertant, and that his delay in making disclaimer was unreasonable, were questions of fact; but, since the Court of Claims in

Marconi Patent No. 768,772.
This patent, granted June 28, 1904, on an application
filed November 10, 1900, and assigned to the Marconi
Company on March 6, 1905,1 is for improvements in apparatus for wireless telegraphy by means of Hertzian
oscillations or electrical waves. In wireless telegraphy,
signals given by means of controlled electrical pulsations
are transmitted through the ether by means of the socalled Hertzian or radio waves. Hertzian waves are electrical oscillations which travel with the speed of light
and have varying wave lengths and consequent frequencies intermediate between the frequency ranges of light
and sound waves. The transmitting apparatus used for
sending the signals is capable, when actuated by a telegraph key or other signalling device, of producing, for
short periods of variable lengths, electrical oscillations of
radio frequency (over 10,000 cycles per second) in an antenna or open circuit from which the oscillations are radiated to a distant receiving apparatus. The receiver has
an open antenna circuit which is electrically responsive
i On November 20, 1919, the Marconi Company assigned to the
Radio Corporation of America all of its assets, including the patents
here in suit, but reserved, and agreed to prosecute, the present claims
against the United States, on which it had instituted suit on July 29,
1916.

to the transmitted waves and is capable of using those
responses to actuate by means of a relay or amplifier any
convenient form of signalling apparatus for making audible an electrically transmitted signal, such as a telegraph
sounder or a loud speaker. In brief, signals at the transmitter are utilized to control high frequency electrical
oscillations which are radiated by an antenna through
the ether to the distant receiver and there produce an
audible or visible signal.
All of these were familia! devices at the time of Marconi's application for the patent now in suit. By that
time radio had passed from the theoretical to the practical
and commercially successful. Four years before, Marconi
had applied for his original and basic patent, which was
granted as No. 586,193, July 13, 1897 and reissued June
4, 1901 as reissue No. 11,913. He applied for his corresponding British patent, No. 12039 of 1896, on June 2,
1896. Marconi's original patent showed a two-circuit system, in which the high frequency oscillations originated in
the transmitter antenna circuit and the detecting device
was connected directly in the receiver antenna circuit.
Between 1896 and 1900 he demonstrated on numerous occasions the practical success of his apparatus, attaining
successful transmission at distances of 70 and 80 miles.
During those years he applied for a large number of patents
in this and other countries for improvements on his system of radio communication.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

320 U. S.

The particular advance said to have been achieved by
the Marconi patent with which we are here concerned
was the use of two high frequency circuits in the transmitter and two in the receiver, all four so adjusted as to
be resonant to the same frequency or multiples of it. The
circuits are so constructed that the electrical impulses in
the antenna circuit of the transmitter vibrate longer with
the application to the transmitter of a given amount of
electrical energy than had been the case in the previous
structures known to the art, and the selectivity and sensitivity of the receiver is likewise enhanced. Thus increased efficiency in the transmission and reception of signals is obtained. The specifications of the Marconi patent state that its object is "to increase the efficiency of
the system and to provide new and simple means whereby
oscillations of electrical waves from a transmitting station may be localized when desired at any one selected
receiving station or stations out of a group of several
receiving-stations."
The specifications describe an arrangement of four high
frequency circuits tuned to one another-two at the sending station associated with a source of low frequency oscillations, and two at the receiving station associated with
a relay or amplifier operating a signalling device. At the
sending station there is an open antenna circuit which is
"a good radiator," connected with the secondary coil of
a transformer, and through it inductively coupled with a
closed circuit, which is connected with the primary coil
of the transformer, this closed circuit being a "persistent
oscillator." At the receiving station there is an open antenna circuit constituting a "good absorber" inductively
coupled with a closed circuit capable of accumulating the
received oscillations.
The patent, in describing the arrangement of the apparatus so as to secure the desired resonance or tuning,
specifies: "The capacity and self-induction of the four

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

circuits--i. e., the primary and secondary circuits at the
transmitting-station and the primary and secondary circuits at any one of the receiving-stations in a communicating system are each and all to be so independently
adjusted as to make the product of the self-induction
multiplied by the capacity the same in each case or multiples of each other-that is to say, the electrical time periods of the four circuits are to be the same or octaves of
each other." ' And again, "In employing this invention
to localize the transmission of intelligence at one of several receiving-stations the time period of the circuits at
each of the receiving-stations is so arranged as to be different from those of the other stations. If the time periods
of the circuits of the transmitting-station are varied until
they are in resonance with those of one of the receivingstations, that one alone of all the receiving-stations will
respond, provided that the distance between the transmitting and receiving stations is not too small."
The drawings and specifications show a closed circuit
at the transmitting station connected with the primary
a Capacity is the property of an electrical circuit which enables it to
receive and store an electrical charge when a voltage is applied to it,
and to release that charge as the applied voltage is withdrawn, thereby
causing a current to flow in the circuit. Although any conductor
of electricity has capacity to some degree, that property is substantially enhanced in a circuit by the use of a condenser, consisting of
two or more metal plates separated by a non-conductor, such that
when a voltage is applied to the circuit one plate will become positively and the other negatively charged.
Self-inductance is the property of a circuit by which, when the
amount or direction of the current passing through it is changed, the
magnetic stresses created induce a voltage opposed to the change.
Although any conductor has self-inductance to some degree, that property is most marked in a coil.

of an induction coil, and embracing a source of electrical
current and a circuit-closing key or other signalling device. The secondary of the induction coil is connected
in a circuit which includes a spark gap or other producer
of high frequency oscillations and, in a shunt around the
spark gap, the primary coil of an oscillation transformer
and a condenser, preferably so arranged that its capacity
can readily be varied. This shunt circuit constitutes one
of the two tuned circuits of the transmitter, and is often
referred to as the closed or charging circuit. The secondary coil of the transformer is connected in the open
or antenna circuit, one end of which is connected with the
earth, the other to a vertical wire antenna or an elevated
plate. This antenna circuit also includes an induction coil,
preferably one whose inductance is readily variable, located between the antenna or plate and the transformer.
The receiver consists of a similar antenna circuit connected with the primary coil of a transformer, and having
a variable induction coil located between the antenna or
plate and the transformer. A shunt circuit bridging the
transformer and containing a condenser which is preferably adjustable may also be 'added. The secondary coil
of the transformer is connected through one or more interposed inductance coils, "preferably of variable inductance," with the terminals of a coherer ' or other suitable
detector of electrical oscillations. The closed receiver
circuit also contained one or more condensers.
I A coherer was a device disclosed by Branly as early as 1891. It
was used by Lodge in experiments described in the London Electrician for June 15, 1894, p. 189, and was in common use thereafter as
a detector of radio waves until replaced by the crystal and the cathodeanode tube. The most common form consisted of a tube containing
metal filings which, in their normal state, were a non-conductor.
When placed in a circuit through which high frequency oscillations
passed, the filings aligned themselves in a continuous stream through
which the low frequency electrical current operating a key or other

The devices and arrangements specified are suitable
for effecting the electrical transmission of signals in the
manner already indicated. By the maintenance of the
same high frequency throughout the four-circuit system
the cumulative resonance is attained which gives the desired increased efficiency in transmission and increased
selectivity at the receiving station.
The patent describes the operation of the four circuits
as follows, beginning with the transmitter:
"In operation the signalling-key b is pressed, and this
closes the primary of the induction-coil. Current then
rushes through the transformer-circuit and the condenser
e is charged and subsequently discharges through the
spark-gap. If the capacity, the inductance, and the resistance of the circuit are of suitable values, the discharge
is oscillatory; with the result that alternating currents of
high frequency pass through the primary of the transformer and induce similar oscillations in the secondary,
these oscillations being rapidly radiated in the form of
electric waves by the elevated conductor [antenna].
"For the best results and in order to effect the selection
of the station or stations whereat the transmitted oscillations are to be localized I include in the open secondary
circuit of the transformer, and preferably between the
radiator fand the secondary coil d', an inductance-coil g,
Fig. 1, having numerous coils, and the connection is such
that a greater or less number of turns of the coil can be
put in use, the proper number being ascertained by
experiment."
signalling device could pass. By means of a device which tapped
the sides of the tube, the stream of filings was broken when the highfrequency oscillations ceased. Thus the coberer was a sensitive device
by which weak, high-frequency signals could be made to actuate a
low-frequency current of sufficient power to operate a telegraphic
key or other device producing a visible or audible signal.

The invention thus described may summarily be stated
to be a structure and arrangement of four high frequency
circuits, with means of independently adjusting each so
that all four may be brought into electrical resonance with
one another. This is the broad invention covered by
Claim 20. Combinations covering so much of the invention as is embodied in the transmitter and the receiver respectively are separately claimed.8
Long before Marconi's application for this patent the
scientific principles of which he made use were well understood and the particular appliances constituting elements
in the apparatus combination which he claimed were
well known. About seventy years ago Clerk Maxwell described the scientific theory of wireless communication
through the transmission of electrical energy by ether
waves.' Between 1878 and 1890 Hertz devised apparatus
for achieving that result which was described by de Tunzelmann in a series of articles published in the London
6 Of the claims in suit in No. 369, Claims 10 and 20 cover the fourcircuit system, while Claims 1, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12 cover the two transmitter circuits and Claims 2, 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19 cover the two receiver circuits. Claim 10 merely provides that the four circuits be in
resonance with each other and hence does not prescribe means of adjusting the tuning. Claim 11 likewise prescribes no means of adjustment. The other claims provide means of adjustment, either a "variable inductance" (Claims 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 13, 18, and 19) or more generally "means" for adjusting the period of the circuits (Claims 3, 6, 14
and 17). Some of the claims merely provide means of adjusting the
tuning of the antenna circuit (Claims 1, 2, 8, 12, and 13) and hence do
not require that the closed circuits be tuned. Others either specifically prescribe the adjustable tuning of both circuits at transmitter
(Claims 3, 6) or receiver (Claims 18 and 19) or both (Claim 20) or else
prescribe "means for adjusting the two transformer-circuits in electrical resonance with each other, substantially as described" (Claims
14 and 17).

Opinion of the Court.

Electrician in 1888. One, of September 21, 1888, showed
a transmitter comprising a closed circuit inductively coupled with an open circuit. The closed circuit included a
switch or circuit breaker capable of use for sending signals,
and an automatic circuit breaker capable, when the switch
was closed, of setting up an intermittent current in the
closed circuit which in turn induced through a transformer
an intermittent current of higher voltage in the open circuit. The open circuit included a spark gap across which
a succession of sparks were caused to leap whenever the
signal switch was closed, each spark producing a series of
high frequency oscillations in the open circuit.
By connecting the spark gap to large area plates in the
open circuit Hertz increased the capacity and thus not
only increased the force of the sparks but also changed
one of the two factors determining the frequency of the
oscillations in the circuit, and hence the wave length of
the oscillations transmitted. Hertz's receiver was shown
as a rectangle of wire connected to the knobs of a spark
gap, both the wire and the spark gap being of specified
lengths of such relationship as to render the circuit resonant to the wave lengths in the transmitter. At times
Hertz attached to the rectangle additional vertical wires
which provided additional capacity, and whose length
could readily be varied so as to vary the wave lengths to
which the receiver was responsive, thus providing a
"method of adjusting the capacity" of the receiver.'
Thus Hertz at the outset of radio communication recognized the importance of resonance and provided means
for securing it by tuning both his transmitting and re7See the London Electrician for September 21, 1888, p. 628.
Ebert, in the London Electrician for July 6, 1894, p. 333, likewise
pointed out that Hertz's receivers are "so arranged that they show
the maximum resonant effect with a given exciter; they are 'electrically
tuned.'"

ceiving circuits to the same frequency, by adjusting the
capacity of each.'
Lodge, writing in the London Electrician in 1894, elaborated further on the discoveries of Hertz and on his own
experiments along the same lines. In one article, of June
8, 1894, he discussed phenomena of resonance and made
an observation which underlies several of the disclosures
in Marconi's patent. Lodge pointed out that some circuits were by their nature persistent vibrators, i. e., were
able to sustain for a long period oscillations set up in
them, while others were so constructed that their oscillations were rapidly damped. He said that a receiver so
constructed as to be rapidly damped would respond to
waves of almost any frequency, while one that was a persistent vibrator would respond only to waves of its own
natural periodicity. Lodge pointed out further that
Hertz's transmitter "radiates very powerfully" but that
"In consequence of its radiation of energy, its vibrations
are rapidly damped, and it only gives some three or four
good strong swings. Hence it follows that it has a wide
range of excitation, i. e., it can excite sparks in conductors
barely at all in tune with it." On the other hand Hertz's
receiver was "not a good absorber but a persistent vibrator, well adapted for picking up disturbances of precise
8 De Tunzelmann shows that Hertz clearly understood the principles
of electrical resonance. Some of his early experiments were designed

to determine whether principles of resonance were applicable to high
frequency electrical circuits. From them Hertz concluded that "an
oscillatory current of definite period would, other conditions being the
same, exert a much greater inductive effect upon one of equal period
than upon one differing even slightly from it." Id. p. 626. Hertz
knew that the frequency to which a circuit was resonant was a function of the square root of the product of the self-inductance and capacity in the circuit and by a formula similar to that now used he
calculated the approximate frequency of the oscillations produced by
his transmitter. Id., September 28, 1888, 664-5.

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

and measurable wave-length." Lodge concluded that
"The two conditions, conspicuous energy of radiation and
persistent vibration electrically produced, are at present
incompatible." (pp. 154-5.)
In 1892, Crookes published an article in the Fortnightly
Review in which he definitely suggested the use of Hertzian waves for wireless telegraphy and pointed out that
the method of achieving that result was to be found in the
use and improvement of then known means of generating
electrical waves of any desired wave length, to be transmitted through the ether to a receiver, both sending and
receiving instruments being attuned to a definite wave
length.' A year later Tesla, who was then preoccupied
with the wireless transmission of power for use in lighting
or for the operation of dynamos, proposed, in a lecture
before the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, the use of
adjustable high frequency oscillations for wireless transmission of signals."
Marconi's original patent No. 586,193, which was
granted July 13,1897, and became reissue No. 11,913, disclosed a two-circuit system for the transmission and reception of Hertzian waves. The transmitter comprised
an antenna circuit connected at one end to an aerial plate
and at the other to the ground, and containing a spark
gap. To the knobs of the spark gap was connected a
transformer whose secondary was connected with a source
of current and a signalling key. The low frequency current thereby induced in the antenna circuit was caused
to discharge through the spark gap, producing the high
frequency oscillations which were radiated by the antenna. The receiver similiarly contained an antenna
circuit between an elevated plate and the ground, in which

a coherer was directly connected. Marconi claimed the
construction of transmitter and receiver so as to be resonant to the same frequency, and described means of
doing so by careful determination of the size of the aerial
plates.
The Tesla patent No. 645,576, applied for September
2, 1897 and allowed March 20, 1900, disclosed a fourcircuit system, having two circuits each at transmitter and
receiver, and recommended that all four circuits be tuned
to the same frequency. Tesla's apparatus was devised
primarily for the transmission of energy to any form of
energy-consuming device by using the rarified atmosphere at high elevations as a conductor when subjected
to the electrical pressure of a very high voltage. But he
also recognized that his apparatus could, without change,
be used for wireless communication, which is dependent
upon the transmission of electrical energy. His specifications declare: "The apparatus which I have shown will
obviously have many other valuable uses- as, for instance,
when it is desired to transmit intelligible messages to great
distances . . ." 11

Tesla's specifications disclosed an arrangement of four
circuits, an open antenna circuit coupled, through a transformer, to a closed charging circuit at the transmitter,
and an open antenna circuit at the receiver similarly coupled to a closed detector circuit. His patent also in-

UTesla's specifications state that the current should preferably be
"of very considerable frequency." In describing apparatus used experimentally by him, the specifications state that the oscillations are
generated in the charging circuit by the periodic discharge of a condenser by means of "a mechanically operated brcak," a means whose
effects are similar to those of the spark gap generally used at this
period in the radio art. He further states that the inductance of the
charging circuit is so calculated that the "primary circuit vibrates
generally according to adjustment, from two hundred and thirty
thousand to two hundred and fifty thousand times per second." The

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

structed those skilled in the art that the open and closed
circuits in the transmitting system and in the receiving
system should be in electrical resonance with each other.
His specifications state that the "primary and secondary
circuits in the transmitting apparatus" are "carefully synchronized." They describe the method of achieving this
by adjusting the length of wire in the secondary winding
of the oscillation transformer in the transmitter, and similarly in the receiver, so that "the points of highest potential are made to coincide with the elevated terminals" of
the antenna, i. e., so that the antenna circuit will be resonant to the frequency developed in he charging circuit of
the transmitter. The specifications further state that
"the results were particularly satisfactory when the primary coil or system A' with its secondary C' [of the receiver] was carefully adjusted, so as to vibrate in synchronism with the transmitting coil or system AC."
Tesla thus anticipated the following features of the
Marconi patent: A charging circuit in the transmitter for
causing oscillations of the desired frequency, coupled,
through a transformer, with the open antenna circuit, and
the synchronization of the two circuits by the proper disposition of the inductance in either the closed or the antenna circuit or both. By this and the added disclosure
of the two-circuit arrangement in the receiver with similar adjustment, he anticipated the four-circuit tuned
range of radio frequencies in use in 1917 was said by a witness for
the plaintiff to extend from 30,000 to 1,500,000 cycles per second. The

range of frequencies allocated for radio use by the International Telecommunication Convention, proclaimed June 27, 1934, 49 Stat. 2391,
2459, is from 10 to 60,000 kilocycles (10,000 to 60,000,000 cycles) per
second, and the spectrum of waves over which the Federal Communications Commission currently exercises jurisdiction extends from 10
to 500,000 kilocycles. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Ch. I,

frequencies.

combination of Marconi. A feature of the Marconi combination not shown by Tesla was the use of a variable inductance as a means of adjusting the tuning of the antenna circuit of transmitter and receiver. This was
developed by Lodge after Tesla's patent but before the
Marconi patent in suit.
In patent No. 609,154, applied for February 1, 1898 and
allowed August 16, 1898, before Marconi's application,
Lodge disclosed an adjustable induction coil in the open or
antenna circuit in a wireless transmitter or receiver or both
to enable transmitter and receiver to be tuned together.
His patent provided for the use, in the open circuits of a
transmitter and a receiver of Hertzian waves, of a selfinduction coil between a pair of capacity areas which he
stated might be antenna and earth. His specifications
state that a coil located as described could be made adjustable at will so as to vary the value of its self-inductance;
that the adjustment, to secure the "desired frequency of
vibration or syntony with a particular distant station,"
may be attained either "by replacing one coil by another"
or by the use of a coil constructed with a movable switch so
related to the coil as to short circuit, when closed, any
desired number of turns of the wire, "so that the whole or
any smaller portion of the inductance available may be
used in accordance with the correspondingly-attuned
receiver at the particular station to which it is desired to
signal." Thus Lodge adjusted his tuning by varying the
self-inductance of the antenna circuits, for, as he explained,
the adjustment of wave lengths, and hence of frequency in
the circuits, could be made by varying either or both the
inductance and capacity, which are the factors controlling
wave length and hence frequency in the antenna circuits.
Lodge thus broadly claimed the tuning, by means of a
variable inductance, of the antenna circuits in a system
of radio communication. His specifications disclose what
is substantially a two-circuit system, with one high fre-

quency circuit at the transmitter and one at the receiver.
He also showed a two-circuit receiver with a tuned antenna circuit, his detector circuit at the receiver being
connected with the terminals of a secondary coil wound
around the variable inductance coil in the antenna circuit
and thus inductively coupled through a transformer with
the antenna circuit.12 Lodge thus supplied the means
of varying inductance and hence tuning which was lacking
in the Tesla patent. He also showed a receiver which
completely anticipated those of the Marconi receiver
claims which prescribe adjustable means of tuning only
in the antenna circuit (Claims 2, 13 and 18) and partially
anticipated the other receiver claims.
The Stone patent No. 714,756, applied for February 8,
1900, nine months before Marconi's application, and allowed December 2, 1902, a year and a half before the
grant of Marconi's patent, showed a four-circuit wireless
telegraph apparatus substantially like that later specified
and patented by Marconi. It described adjustable tuning, by means of a variable inductance, of the closed circuits of both transmitter and receiver. It also recommended that the two antenna circuits be so constructed
as to be resonant to the same frequencies as the closed circuits. This recommendation was added by amendment
to the specifications made after Marconi had filed his application, and the principal question is whether the
amendments were in point of substance a departure from
Stone's invention as disclosed by his application.
Stone's application shows an intimate understanding
of the mathematical and physical principles underlying
radio communication and electrical circuits in general.
-12 Marconi's patent No. 627,650, of June 27, 1899, similarly showed
a two-circuit receiving system, in which the coherer was placed in a
closed circuit which was inductively coupled with a tuned antenna
circuit. The Court of Claims found, however, that this patent did
not clearly disclose the desirability of tuning both circuit.

It contains a critical analysis of the state of the art of
radio transmission and reception. He said that as yet it
had not been found possible so to tune stations using a
vertical antenna as to make possible selective reception
by a particular station to the exclusion of others. His
effort, accordingly, was to transmit a "simple harmonic
wave" of well defined periodicity to a receiver which would
be selectively responsive to the particular frequency
transmitted, and thereby to achieve greater precision of
tuning and a higher degree of selectivity.
Stone discusses in some detail the difference between
"natural" and "forced" oscillations. He says "If the electrical equilibrium of a conductor be abruptly disturbed
and the conductor thereafter be left to itself, electric currents will flow in the conductor, which tend to ultimately
restore the condition of electrical equilibrium." He
points out that a closed circuit containing a condenser and
a coil is "capable of oscillatory restoration of equilibrium
upon the sudden discharge of the condenser" and that
"the electrical oscillations which it supports when its
equilibrium is abruptly disturbed and it is then left to itself are known as the natural vibrations or oscillations of
the system."
In addition to its ability to originate "natural vibrations" when its electrical equilibrium is disturbed, Stone
says that an electrical circuit is also "capable of supporting
what are termed forced vibrations" when electrical oscillations elsewhere created are impressed upon it. In contrast to the "natural" vibrations of a circuit, whose frequency depends upon "the relation between the electromagnetic constants [capacity and self-inductance] of the
circuit," the frequency of the "forced" vibrations is "independent of the constants of the circuit" on which they
are impressed and "depends only upon the period [frequency] of the impressed force." In other words, Stone
found that it was possible not only to originate high-

frequency oscillations in a circuit, and to determine their
frequency by proper distribution of capacity and selfinductance in the circuit, but also to transfer those
oscillations to another circuit and retain their original
frequency.
Stone points out that in the existing systems of radio
transmission the electric oscillations are "naturally" developed in the antenna circuit by the sudden discharge
of accumulated electrical force through a spark qap in that
circuit. Such oscillations are "necessarily of a complex
character and consist of a great variety of superimposed
simple harmonic vibrations of different frequencies."
"Similarly the vertical conductor at the receiving station
is capable of receiving and responding to vibrations of
a great variety of frequencies so that the electro-magnetic
waves which emanate from one vertical conductor used as
a transmitter are capable of exciting vibrations in any
other vertical wire as a receiver . . . and the messages

from the transmitting station will not be selectively received by the particular receiving station with which it is
desirous to communicate, and will interfere with the operation of other receiving stations within its sphere of
influence."
In contrast to the two-circuit system whose inadequacies he-had thus described, Stone's drawings and specifications disclose a four-circuit system for transmitting and
receiving radio waves which was very similar to that later
disclosed by Marconi. The transmitter included a source
of low frequency oscillating current and a telegraph or
signalling key connected in a circuit which was inductively coupled with another closed circuit. This included
an induction coil, a condenser, and a spark gap capable
of generating high frequency oscillations. It in turn was
inductively coupled through a transformer with an open
antenna circuit connected to an aerial capacity ht one end
and the earth at the other. The receiver included a sim-

ilar antenna circuit, inductively coupled with a closed
oscillating circuit containing an induction coil, a condenser, and a coherer or other detector of radio waves.
Stone thus recognized, although he used different terminology, the fact, previously observed by Lodge, that an
open antenna circuit, so constructed as to be an efficient
radiator, was not an oscillator capable of producing
natural waves of a single well-defined periodicity, and
consequently had a wide range of excitation. He adopted
the same remedy for this defect as Marconi later did,
namely to produce the oscillations in a closed circuit capable of generating persistent vibrations of well-defined
periodicity, and then induce those oscillations in an open
antenna circuit capable of radiating them efficiently to a
distant resonant receiver. He states that the vibrations
in his closed circuit "begin with a maximum of amplitude
and gradually die away," a good description of the results obtainable by a "persistent oscillator." I Similarly
in his receiver Stone recognized that an open antenna
circuit (Lodge's "good absorber") was not a highly sensitive responder to waves of a particular frequency, and
accordingly he sought to augment the selectivity of tuning
at the receiver by interposing between the antenna circuit
and the responding device a closed circuit which would
be a more persistent vibrator and hence render the receiv13 That the closed circuit was intended to be a "persistent oscillator"
is also brought out by Stone's emphasis on "loose coupling." Stone's
application explained in detail the fact that when two circuits are
inductively coupled together there normally result "two degrees of
freedom," that is to say, the superposition of two frequencies in the
same circuit because of the effect on each of the magnetic lines of
force set up by the other. He discussed in detail methods of eliminating this superposition, which interfered with accurate selectivity of
tuning, by so constructing his circuits as to be "loosely coupled."
This he achieved by including in the closed circuits a large inductance
coil, which had the effect of "swamping" the undesirable effect of

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

ing apparatus more selectively responsive to waves of
a particular frequency. In so doing, however, as will
presently appear, he did not disregard the favorable effect
on selectivity of tuning afforded by making the antenna
circuits resonant to the transmitted frequency.
Stone's application recommends that the inductance
coils in the closed circuits at transmitter and receiver "be
made adjustable and serve as a means whereby the operators may adjust the apparatus to the particular frequency which it is intended to employ." He thus disclosed
a means of adjusting the tuning of the closed circuits
by variable inductance. His original application nowhere
states in so many words that the antenna circuits should
be tuned, nor do its specifications or drawings explicitly
disclose any means for adjusting the tuning of those circuits. But there is nothing in them to suggest that Stone
did not intend to have the antenna circuits tuned, and
we think that the principles which he recognized in his
application, the purpose which he sought to achieve, and
certain passages in his specifications, show that he recognized, as they plainly suggest to those skilled in the
art, the desirability of tuning the antenna circuits as well.
The disclosures of his application were thus an adequate
basis for the specific recommendation, later added by
amendment, as to the desirability of constructing the
the lines of force set up in the primary of the transformer by the
current induced in the secondary. Since the turns of wire in the
primary of the transformer constituted a relatively small part of

the total inductance in the closed circuit the effect of those turns
on the frequency of the circuit was minimized.
But the testimony at the trial was in substantial agreement that

the looser the coupling the slower is the transfer of energy from the
closed charging circuit to the open antenna circuit. Hence the use
of loose coupling presupposes a charging circuit that will store its
energy for a considerable period, i. e., that will maintain persistent
oscillations.

antenna circuits so as to be resonant to the frequency
produced in the charging circuit of the transmitter.
The major purpose of Stone's system was the achievement of greater selectivity of tuning. His objective was
to transmit waves "of but a single frequency" and to
receive them at a station which "shall be operated only
by electric waves of a single frequency and no others."
He states:
"By my invention the vertical conductor of the transmitting station is made the source of electro-magnetic waves
of but a single periodicity, and the translating apparatus
at the receiving station is caused to be selectively responsive to waves of but a single periodicity so that the transmitting apparatus corresponds to a tuning fork sending
but a single simple musical tone, and the receiving appaiatus corresponds to an acoustic resonator capable of
absorbing the energy of that single, simple musical tone
only."
He says that "when the apparatus at a particular [receiving] station" is properly tuned to a particular transmitting station the receiver will selectively receive messages
from it. He adds:
"Moreover, by my invention the operator at the transmitting or receiving station may at will adjust the apparatus at his command in such a way as to place himself
in communication with any one of a number of stations
. . . by bringing his apparatus into resonance with the
periodicity employed."
And with respect to the transmitter he says, "It is to be
understood that any suitable device may be employed to
develop the simple harmonic force impressed upon the
vertical wire [antenna]. It is sufficient to develop in the
vertical wire practically simple harmonic vibrations of
a fixed and high frequency."

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
Opinion of the Court.

These statements sufficiently indicate Stone's broad
purpose of providing a high degree of tuning at sending
and receiving stations. In seeking to achieve that end he
not unnaturally placed emphasis on the tuning of the
closed circuits, the association of which with the antenna
circuits was an important improvement which he was the
first to make. But he also made it plain that it was the
sending and receiving "apparatus" which he wished to
tune, so that the sending "apparatus" "would correspond
to a tuning fork" and the receiving "apparatus" to "an
acoustic resonator" capable of absorbing the energy of the
"single, simple musical tone" transmitted. And this he
sought to achieve by "any suitable device."
Stone thus emphasized the desirability of making the
entire transmitting and receiving "apparatus" resonant to
a particular frequency. As none of the circuits are resonant to a desired frequency unless they are tuned to that
frequency, this reference to the transmitting and receiving
apparatus as being brought into resonance with each other
cannot fairly be said to mean that only some of the circuits
at the transmitter and receiver were to be tuned. To say
that by this reference to the tuning of sending and receiving apparatus he meant to confine his invention to the
tuning of some only of the circuits in that apparatus is to
read into his specifications a restriction which is plainly
not there and which contradicts everything they say about
the desirability of resonance of the apparatus. It is to
read the specifications, which taken in their entirety are
merely descriptive or illustrative of his invention, compare

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

Stone had pointed out that the tuning of the antenna
circuits shown in the prior art did not of itself afford sufficient selectivity. It was for that reason that he used
the tuned closed circuit in association with the antenna
circuit. But in the face of his emphasis on the desirability of tuning the transmitting and receiving apparatus,
we cannot impute to him an intention to exclude from his
apparatus the well known use of tuning in the antenna
circuits as an aid to the selectivity which it was his purpose to achieve. The inference to be drawn is rather that
he intended the tuned closed circuits which he proposed
to add to the then known systems of radio communication,
to be used in association with any existing type of vertical wire antenna circuit, including one so constructed
as to be either resonant to a particular frequency, or adjustably resonant to any desired frequency, both of which
involved tuning.
Stone's full appreciation of the value of making all of
his circuits resonant to the same frequency is shown by
his suggestion to insert, between the closed and antenna
circuits at the transmitter and receiver, one or more additional closed circuits, so constructed as to be highly resonant to the particular frequency employed. He says
that the purpose of such an intermediate circuit is "to
weed out and thereby screen" the antenna circuit at the
transmitter and the detecting device at the receiver from
any harmonics or other impurities in the wave structure.
He states: "This screening action of an interposed resonant circuit is due to the well known property of such
circuits by which a resonant circuit favors the development in it of simple harmonic currents of the period to
which it is attuned and strongly opposes the development
in it of simple harmonic currents of other periodicities."
His original application thus disclosed the advantage,
where vibrations created in one circuit are to be impressed on another, of making the latter circuit resonant
to the same frequency as the former, in view of the "well

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

1

Opinion of the Court.

known property" of a resonant circuit to favor the "de-

velopment" in it of forced vibrations of the same frequency as its natural periodicity.
Stone's application shows that these principles of resonant circuits were no less applicable to the antenna circuit,
and suggests the use of "any suitable device" to "develop"
in the antenna circuit the "simple harmonic force im-

pressed" upon it. It was then well known in the art that
every electrical circuit is to some degree resonant to a
particular frequency to which it responds more readily
and powerfully than to others. Although the degree of
resonance attained by a vertical wire is small, its natural
resonance is no different in kind from that of a closed
circuit such as Stone's screening circuit. Stone recognized this in his application. In describing the complex
natural vibrations set up by a sudden discharge in an
antenna circuit, such as that commonly used at the time
of his application, Stone said that "the vibrations consist of a simple harmonic vibration of lower period than
all the others, known as the fundamental with a great
variety of superimposed simple harmonics of higher periodicity superimposed thereon." And he says that the oscillations developed in the charging circuit of his system
"induce corresponding oscillations in the vertical wire,"
which are "virtually" forced vibrations, and "practically
independent, as regards their frequency, of the constants
of the second circuit in which they are induced"-a plain
recognition that the antenna circuit has electro-magnetic
constants which affect its natural periodicity, and that that
natural periodicity does have some effect on the frequency
of the vibrations impressed upon the antenna circuit."'
11 Stone's recognition of the similarity between his antenna circuit
and his screening circuit is further shown by his direction that the
coupling between the screening circuit and the charging circuit, like
that between the antenna and charging circuits where no screening
circuit is used, be loose. See note 12, supra.

26

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

Thus Stone did not, as the Marconi Company suggests,
say that the antenna circuit had no natural periodicity.
He recognized that its natural periodicity was less strongly
marked than that of his closed circuit, and hence that
the wave structure could be greatly improved by creating the oscillations in a closed circuit such as he described. But he also plainly recognized that the antenna
circuit, like his screening circuit, was a circuit having
a natural period of vibration which would therefore be
more responsive to impressed oscillations of that same
periodicity. Since he had previously said that "any suitable device may be employed to develop the simple
harmonic force impressed upon the vertical wire," we
think that Stone's specifications plainly suggested to those
skilled in the art that they avail themselves of this means
of developing in the antenna this simple harmonic force,
and that they tune the antenna circuit in order to improve the strength and quality of the "forced" vibrations
impressed upon it.
The Marconi Company argues that Stone's theory of
"forced" oscillations presupposes that the open transmitter circuit be untuned. It is true that Stone said
that such "forced" oscillations have a period of vibration which is "independent of the electrical constants of
the circuit" on which they are impressed. But the fact
that the "forced" vibration will retain its natural period
whatever the frequency of the antenna circuit may be,
does not preclude, as Stone showed, the tuning of that
circuit so as to achieve maximum responsiveness to the
vibrations impressed upon it. Stone's specifications
indicate that he used the term "forced" merely as meaning that the vibrations are developed in another circuit
and then transferred to the antenna circuit by inductive
coupling, as distinguished from "natural" vibrations
which originate in the antenna or radiating circuit-in
short that "forced" is merely used as a synonym for "in-

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

duced." Thus he states in describing the operation of
his transmitter, "The high frequency current ... passing through the primary It [of the antenna transformer]
induces a corresponding high-frequency electromotive
force and current in the secondary I and forced electric
vibrations result in the vertical conductor v .

."

Hence there is ample support for the finding of the
court below that
"By free oscillations is meant that their frequency was
determined by the constants of the circuit in which they
were generated. The Stone application as filed impressed these oscillations upon the open circuit, and
therefore used 'forced' oscillations in the open circuit of
the transmitter, that is, the frequency of the oscillations
in the open circuit was determined by the frequency of
the oscillations in the closed circuit.
"The effect of forcing vibrations upon a tuned and untuned circuit may be likened unto the effect of a tuning
fork upon a stretched cord in a viscous medium. When
the cord is vibrated by the tuning fork it has the same
period as does the fork regardless of whether such period
be that of the natural period of the cord, but when the
fork vibrations are in tune with the natural period or
15 Stone's

language here makes it plain that throughout his allusions to a frequency developed in one circuit as being "impressed"
or "forced" on another circuit when the two circuits are coupled
through a transformer, are used figuratively or metaphorically only
as synonymous with "induced." Scientifically the oscillations in the
charging circuit are not impressed or forced on the other. The
stress in the magnetic field of the first circuit sets up or induces corresponding stresses in the magnetic field of the other circuit. The
resulting frequency in the second circuit is affected both by the frequency of the oscillations in the charging circuit and the inductance
and capacity in the second circuit. The result may be the superposition of two frequencies in the second circuit. This may be avoided
and a single frequency developed, as Stone showed, by tuning the second circuit so as to be resonant to the frequencies created in the first.

fundamental of the cord, then the amplitude of vibrations
in the cord is a maximum."
Thus Stone's application, prior to Marconi, showed a
four-circuit system, in which the oscillations were produced in a closed charging circuit and impressed on an
open antenna circuit in the transmitter, and were similarly
received in an open antenna circuit and by it induced in
a closed circuit containing a detector. He showed the
effect of resonance on the circuits resulting from their tuning to a desired frequency, and emphasized the importance
of making the transmitting and receiving apparatus resonant to that frequency.
Stone's patent, 6 granted a year and a half before Marconi-although after Marconi's application was filedmakes explicit, as the patent law permits, what was implicit in Stone's application. By amendments to his specifications made April 8, 1902, he recommended that the
frequency impressed upon the vertical conductor at the
transmitter "may or may not be the same as the natural
period or fundamental of such conductor" and that the
antenna circuit at the transmitter "may with advantage
be so constructed as to be highly resonant to a particular
frequency and the harmonic vibrations impressed thereon may with advantage be of that frequency." Since
Stone used a variable inductance to alter at will the frequency of the charging circuit, this direction plainly indicated that the frequency of the antenna circuit might
also be variable, and suggested the inclusion of the wellknown Lodge variable inductance in the construction of
the antenna circuit to achieve that result. And since
Stone had specified that "by my invention" the operator
at the receiving station is able to "adjust" the receiving

18 At the insistence of the Patent Office Stone divided his original
application, and was granted two patents, No. 714,756 for a method

apparatus so as to place it in resonance with any particular
transmitting station, his patent equally plainly suggested
the use of the Lodge variable inductance as a means of
adjusting the tuning of the receiving antenna.
Stone's 1902 amendments also suggested that an "elevated conductor that is aperiodic may be employed"i. e., one having very weak natural periodicity and consequently "adapted to receive or transmit all frequencies."
But this suggestion was accompanied by the alternative
recommendation in the 1902 amendments that the antenna circuits at transmitter and receiver "may with advantage be made resonant to a particular frequency," i. e.,
be periodic. No inference can be drawn from this that
only an aperiodic antenna was contemplated either by
the application or the amendments. The application
was sufficiently broad to cover both types, since both
were suitable means of achieving under different conditions the results which the application described and
sought to attain. The amendments thus merely clarified
and explained in fuller detail two alternative means which
could be employed in the invention described in the original application, one of those means being the construction
of the antenna so as to be highly resonant, i. e., tuned,
to a particular frequency."T
The only respects in which it is seriously contended
that Marconi disclosed invention over Stone are that
Marconi explicitly claimed four-circuit tuning before
if This is borne out by the subsequent letter from Stone to the
Commisioner of Patents dated June 7, 1902. Stone there refers to a
letter by the Patent Office saying that the statement that a simple
harmonic wave developed in the closed circuit "can be transferred to
the elevated conductor and from the latter to the ether without
change of form" is "an argument the soundness of which the Office

has no means of testing." Stone replied with arguments to show
that the vibrations radiated by the antenna circuit would be sufficiently pure for practical purposes either if the antenna circuit were

Stone had made it explicit by his 1902 amendment, and
that Marconi disclosed means of adjusting the tuning of
each of his four circuits whereas Stone had explicitly
shown adjustable tuning only in the two closed circuits.
But we think that neither Marconi's tuning of the two
antenna circuits nor his use of the Lodge variable inductance to that end involved any invention over Stone.
Two questions are involved, first, whether there was any
invention over Stone in tuning the antenna circuits, and,
second, whether there was any invention in the use of
the Lodge variable inductance or any other known means
of adjustment in order to make the tuning of the antenna
circuits adjustable.
For reasons already indicated we think it clear that
Stone showed tuning of the antenna circuits before Marconi, and if this involved invention Stone was the first
inventor. Stone's application emphasized the desirability of tuning, and disclosed meaps of adjusting the tuning
of the closed circuits. His very explicit recognition of the
increased selectivity attained by inductive coupling of
several resonant circuits plainly suggested to those skilled
in the art that the antenna circuit could with advantage
be a resonant circuit, that is to say a tuned circuit, and
hence that it was one of the circuits to be tuned. He
stressed the importance of tuning "by any suitable device" the "apparatus" at transmitter and receiver, which

aperiodic, or if it had a fundamental which was of the same fre-

quency as that of the forced vibrations impressed upon it, although
they would not be pure if the antenna circuit had a marked natural
periodicity and was untuned. This letter, while somewhat later in
date than the amendments, reinforces the conclusion that the purpose of those amendments was to explain more fully the details of
theory and practice necessary to the success of the idea underlying
Stone's original invention.

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

31

Opinion of the Court.

Tuning of the antenna circuit was nothing new;
Lodge had not only taught that the antenna circuits at
transmitter and receiver should be tuned to each other
but had shown a means of adjusting the tuning which
was the precise means adopted by Marconi, and which
Stone had, prior to Marconi, used to tune his closed circuit-the variable inductance. Tesla, too, had shown
the tuning of the antenna circuit at the transmitter to
the frequency developed by the charging circuit, and the
tuning of both circuits at the receiver to the frequency
thus transmitted. Thus Marconi's improvement in tuning the antenna circuits is one the principles of which
were well understood and stated by Stone himself before
Marconi, and the mechanism for achieving which had
previously been disclosed by Lodge and Stone.18
Since no invention over Stone was involved in tuning
the antenna circuits, neither Marconi nor Stone made
an invention by providing adjustable tuning of any of
the circuits or by employing Lodge's variable inductance
as a means of adjusting the tuning of the resonant fourcircuit arrangement earlier disclosed by Stone's application and patented by him. No invention was involved
in employing the Lodge variable inductance for tuning
18 Itis not without significance that Marconi's application was at
one time rejected by the Patent Office because anticipated by Stone,
and was ultimately allowed, on renewal of his application, on the sole
ground that Marconi showed the use of a variable inductance as a
means of tuning the antenna circuits, whereas Stone, in the opinion
of the Examiner, tuned his antenna circuits by adjusting the length
of the aerial conductor. All of Marconi's claims which included that
element were allowed, and the Examiner stated that the remaining
claims would be allowed if amended to include a variable inductance.
Apparently through oversight, Claims 10 and 11, which failed to
include that element, were included in the patent as granted. In
allowing these claims the Examiner made no reference to Lodge's
prior disclosure of a variable inductance in the antenna circuit.

either the closed or the open circuits in lieu of other structural modes of adjustment for that purpose. The variable
inductance imparted no new function to the circuit; and
merely making a known element of a known combination
adjustable by a means of adjustment known to the art,
when no new or unexpected result is obtained, is not
invention. Peters v. Hanson, 129 U. S.541, 550-51, 553;

cf. Bassick Mfg. Co. v. Hollingshead Co., 298 U. S.415,
424-5 and cases cited.
Stone's conception of his invention as disclosed by his
patent antedated his application. It is carried back to
June 30, 1899, seven months before his application, when,
in a letter to Baker, he described in text and drawings his
four-circuit system for wireless telegraphy in substantially the same form as that disclosed by the application.
His letter is explicit in recommending the tuning of the
antenna circuits. In part he wrote as follows:
"Instead of utilizing the vertical wire [antenna] itself at
the transmitting station as the oscillator, I propose to
impress upon this vertical wire, oscillations from an oscillator, which oscillations shall be of a frequency corresponding to the fundamental of the wire. Similarly at
the receiving station, I shall draw from the vertical wire,
only that component of the complex wave which is of
lowest frequency.
"If now the fundamental of the wire at the receiving
station be the same as that of the wire at the transmitting
station, then the receiving station may receive signals from
the transmitting station, but if it be different from that
of the transmitting station, it may not receive those
signals.
"The tuning of these circuits one to another and all to
the same frequency will probably be best accomplished

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

empirically, though the best general proportions may be
determined mathematically."
On July 18, 1899, Stone again wrote to Baker, mathematically demonstrating how to achieve the single frequency by means of forced vibrations. He expressed as
a trigonometric function the form taken by the forced
wave "if the period of the impressed force be the same as
that of the fundamental of the vertical wire." He also
pointed out that the transmitting circuit which he had
disclosed in his earlier letter to Baker, "is practically the
same as that employed by Tesla," except that Stone added
an inductance coil in the closed circuit "to give additional
means of tuning" and to "swamp" the reactions from the
coil of the oscillation transformer and thus loosen the
coupling between the open and closed circuit of the transmitter." His recognition of the effect upon the current
in the antenna if it is of the same period as the charging
circuit; his statement that his transmitting system was
the same as that employed by Tesla; his recognition that
the fundamental of the receiver should be the same as that
of the transmitter antenna when used for the transmission
of a single frequency, and finally his statement that all
four circuits are to be tuned, "one to another and all to
the same frequency," all indicate his understanding of the
principles of resonance and of the significance of tuning
the antenna circuits.
Stone disclosed his invention to others, and in January,
1900, described it to his class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before 1900 he was diligent in obtaining capital to promote his invention. Early in 1901
a syndicate was organized to finance laboratory experiments. The Stone Telegraph & Telephone Co. was organized in December, 1901. It constructed several experimental stations in 1902 and 1903; beginning in 1904

or 1905 it built wireless stations and sold apparatus,
equipped a Navy collier and some battleships, and it applied for a large number of patents. The apparatus used
in the stations is described by Stone's testimony in this
suit as having resonant open and closed circuits loosely
coupled inductively to each other, at both the transmitter
and receiver, and all tuned to the same wave length, as
described in his letters to Baker and his patent.
We think that Stone's original application sufficiently
disclosed the desirability that the antenna circuits in transmitter and receiver be resonant to the same frequency as
the closed circuits, as he expressly recommended in his
patent. But in any event it is plain that no departure
from or improper addition to the specifications was involved in the 1902 amendments, which merely made explicit what was already implicit. Hobbs v. Beach, 180 U. S.
383, 395-7. We would ordinarily be slow to recognize
amendments made after the filing of Marconi's application and disclosing features shown in that application.

306 U. S. 86. But here Stone's letters to Baker, whose
authenticity has not been questioned in this case, afford
convincing proof that Stone had conceived of the idea of
tuning all four circuits prior to the date of Marconi's invention. Cf. Bickell v. Smith-Hambury-Scott Welding
Co., 53 F. 2d 356, 358.
It is well established that as between two inventors
priority of invention will be awarded to the one who by
satisfying proof can show that he first conceived of the
invention. Philadelphia& Trenton R. Co. v. Stimpson,

Commercial success achieved by the later inventor and
patentee cannot save his patent from the defense of anticipation by a prior inventor.2
Compare Smith v. Hall,
301 U. S. 216 with Smith v. Snow, 294 U. S. 1. To obtain
the benefit of his prior conception, the inventor must not
abandon his invention, Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477,481,
but must proceed with diligence to reduce it to practice.
We think Stone has shown the necessary diligence. Compare Radio Corporationv. Radio Laboratories,supra, 13,
14. The delay until 1902 in including in his patent specifications the sentences already referred to, which explicitly
provide for tuning of the antenna circuits, does not in the
circumstances of this case show any abandonment of that

Even if the lack of invention in Marconi's improvement over

Stone-making adjustable the tuning of the antenna circuits which
Stone had said should be tuned-could be said to be in sufficient
doubt so that commercial success could aid in resolving the doubt,

Compare Altoona Theatres v. Tri-Ergon Corp., supra. Marconi's
specifications disclose a large number of details of construction, none
of which is claimed as invention in this patent, in which his apparatus
differed from, and may have been greatly superior to, Stone's. Many
of these formed the subject of prior patents. After his application
for his patent, as well as before, Marconi made or adopted a great
number of improvements in his system of wireless telegraphy. Two
of his engineers have written that a major factor in his successful
transmission across the Atlantic in December, 1901, was the use of
much greater power and higher antennae than had previously been
attempted, an improvement in no way suggested by the patent here
in suit. Fleming, Electric Wave Telegraphy, 449-3; Vyvyan, Wireless Over Thirty Years, 22-33. Indeed both are agreed that in the
actual transmission across the Atlantic tuning played no part; the
receiver antenna consisted of a wire suspended by a kite which rose

feature of Stone's invention since, as we have seen, the idea
of such tuning was at least implicit in his original application, and the 1902 amendments merely clarified that
application's effect and purport.
Marconi's patent No. 763,772 was sustained by a United
States District Court in Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co.
v. National Signalling Co., 213 F. 815, and his invention
as specified in his corresponding British patent No. 7777
of 1900, was upheld in Marconi v. British Radio & Telegraph Co.; 27 T. L. R. 274, 28 R. P. C. 18. The French
court likewise sustained his French patent, Civil Tribunal
of the Seine, Dec. 24, 1912. None of these courts considered the Stone patent or his letters. All rest their findings of invention on Marconi's disclosure of a four-circuit
system and on his tuning of the four circuits, in the
and fell with the wind, varying the capacity so much as to make
tuning impossible. Ibid.
By 1913, when he testified in the National Electric Signalling Co.
case, that "due to the utilization of the invention" of this patent he
had successfully transmitted messages 6,600 miles, he had, after almost
continuous experimentation, further increased the power used, developed new apparatus capable of use with heavy power, enlarged
his antennae and adopted the use of horizontal, "directional" antennae, and made use of improved types of spark gaps and detecting
apparatus, including the Fleming cathode-anode tube, the crystal
detector, and sound recording of the signals-to mention but a few of
the improvements made. He had also discovered that much greater
distances could be attained at night. See Vyvyan, supra, 34-47,
55-60. The success attained by the apparatus developed by Marconi and his fellow engineers by continuous experimentation over a
period of years--however relevant it might be in resolving doubts
whether the basic four-circuit, tuned system disclosed by Marconi,
and before him by Stone, involved invention--cannot, without further proof, be attributed in significant degree to any particular one
of the many improvements made by Marconi over Stone during a
period of years. The fact that Marconi's apparatus as a whole was
successful does not entitle him to receive a patent for every feature
of its structure.

sense of rendering them resonant to the same frequency,
in both of which respects Stone anticipated Marconi, as
we have seen. None of these opinions suggests that if
the courts had known of Stone's anticipation, they would
have held that Marconi showed invention over Stone by
making the tuning of his antenna circuit adjustable, or
by using Lodge's variable inductance for that purpose.
In Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Kilbourne & Clark
Mfg. Co., 239 F. 328, affirmed 265 F. 644, the district court
held that the accused device did not infringe. While it
entered formal findings of validity which the Circuit Court
of Appeals approved, neither court's opinion discussed
the question of validity and that question was not argued
in the Circuit Court of Appeals.'
Marconi's reputation as the man who first achieved
successful radio transmission rests on his original patent,
which became reissue No. 11,913, and which is not here
'tA preliminary injunction restraining infringement was entered

injunction was also granted in Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. v. Atlantic
Communications Co., an action brought in the Eastern District of
New York.
Stone's letters were introduced in evidence in the Atlantic Communications Company case and the Kilbourne & Clark case. His deposition in the latter case, taken February 28 and 29, 1916, was incorporated in the record in this case. He there testified that he had
refrained from producing proofs of the priority of his invention when
called upon to testify in prior litigation in 1911 and 1914 because
he.wished the priority of his invention to be established by the owners: of the patent-the Stone Telegraph Co. and its bondholders--in
order to be sure that a bona fide defense would be made. He said
that by May 1915, when he testified in the Atlantic Communicationa Co. case, he had concluded that the owners of the patent were
not in a financial position to litigate, and that the Atlantic Co. "would
make a bona fide Stone defense."

in question. That reputation, however well-deserved,
does not entitle him to a patent for every later improve-

ment which he claims in the radio field. Patent cases,
like others, must be decided not by weighing the repu-

tations of the litigants, but by careful study of the merits
of their respective contentions and proofs. As the result
of such a study we are forced to conclude, without under-

taking to determine whether Stone's patent involved invention, that the Court of Claims was right in deciding
that Stone anticipated Marconi, and that Marconi's pat-

ent did not disclose invention over Stone. Hence the
judgment below holding invalid the broad claims of the
Marconi patent must be affirmed. -Inview of our interpretation of the Stone application and patent we need
not consider the correctness of the court's conclusion that
even if Stone's disclosures should be read as failing to
direct that the antenna circuits be made resonant to
a particular frequency, Marconi's patent involved no
invention over Lodge, Tesla, and Stone.
Claim 16 of Marconi patent No. 768,772.
The Government asks us to review so much of the decision of the Court of Claims as held valid and infringed
Claim 16 of Marconi's patent No. 763,772. That claim
is for an antenna circuit at the receiver connected at one
end to "an oscillation-receiving conductor" and at the
other to a capacity (which could be the earth), containing the primary winding of a transformer, "means for adjusting the two transformer-circuits in electrical resonance with each other," and "an adjustable condenser in a
shunt connected with the open circuit, and around said
transformer-coil." Marconi thus discloses and claims the
addition to the receiver antenna of an adjustable condenser connected in a shunt around the primary of the
transformer. The specifications describe the condenser as
"preferably one provided with two telescoping metallic
tubes separated by a dielectric and arranged to readily

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
I

Opinion of the Court.

vary the capacity by being slid upon each other." Marconi, however, makes no claim for the particular construction of the condenser.
Although the claim broadly provides for "means of adjusting the two transformer-circuits in electrical resonance," Marconi's drawings disclose the use of a variable
inductance connected between the aerial conductor and
the transformer-coil in such a manner that the variable
inductance is not included in that part of the antenna
circuit which is bridged by the condenser. The condenser is thus arranged in parallel with the transformer
coil and in series with the variable inductance. In his
specifications Marconi enumerates a number of preferred
adjustments for tuning the transmitting and receiving stations, showing the precise equipment to be used to achieve
tuning to 'the desired wave-length. The two tunings
which show the use of the adjustable condenser in the receiver antenna also make use of the variable inductance.
And his specifications state: "In a shunt around said primary P [the primary of the transformer] I usually place
a condenser h ... An inductance coil g' of variable inductance is interposed in the primary circuit of the transformer, being preferably located between the cylinder f
[the aerial capacity] and the coil f."
In this respect the devices which the court below found
to infringe Claim 16 exhibit somewhat different arrangements. Apparatus manufactured by the Kilbourne and
Clark Company, and used by the Government, had a receiver antenna circuit containing a variable inductance in
addition to the transformer coil, and having an adjustable condenser so constructed that it could be connected
either in series with the two inductances, or in a shunt
bridging both of them. Apparatus manufactured by the
Telefunken Company showed a similar antenna circuit
having no variable inductance, but having an adjustable
condenser so arranged that it could be connected either in

40

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

320 U. S.

series with the transformer coil, or in parallel with it by
placing the condenser in a shunt circuit which would thus
bridge all the inductance in the antenna circuit.
The Marconi patent does not disclose the function
which is served by the adjustable condenser disclosed by
Claim 16, except in so far as Marconi in his specifications,
in describing the means of tuning the receiver circuits to
a particular desired frequency, prescribes specific values
for both the variable inductance and the adjustable condenser in the receiver antenna circuit. The Court of
Claims found that this indicated "that the purpose of the
condenser connected in shunt with the primary winding
of the transformer of the receiver, is to enable the electrical
periodicity or tuning of the open circuit of the receiver to
be altered."
The court thus based its holding that Claim 16 disclosed
patentable invention on its finding that Marconi, by the
use of an adjustable condenser in the antenna circuit, disclosed a new and useful method of tuning that circuit.
The Government contends that the arrangement of the
antenna circuit disclosed by Marconi's specificationswith the condenser shunted around the transformer coil
but not around the variable inductance-is such that the
condenser cannot increase the wave-length over what it
would be without such a condenser, and that it can decrease that wave-length only when adjusted to have a
very small capacity. The Government contends therefore that its principal function is not that of tuning but
of providing "loose coupling." ' The Government does
not deny that this precise arrangement is novel and useful, but it contends that its devices do not infringe that
22See note 13, supra. Most of the current in the antenna circuit
is said to pass through the condenser shunt and not through the transformer coil, thus minimizing the effect upon the frequency of vibrations in the antenna circuit of the magnetic stresses set up in the
primary of the transformer by the current induced in the secondary.

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

precise arrangement, and that Claim 16, if more broadly
construed so as to cover its apparatus, is invalid because
anticipated by the prior art, particularly the patents of
Pupin and Fessenden.
As we have seen from our discussion of the other claims
of the Marconi patent, the idea of tuning the antenna circuits involved no patentable invention. It was well
known that tuning was achieved by the proper adjustment of either the inductance or the capacity in a circuit,
or both. Lodge and Stone had achieved tuning by the
use of an adjustable induction coil, so arranged that its
effective inductance could readily be varied.
But capacity was no less important in tuning. De
Tunzelmann's descriptions of Hertz's experiments show
that Hertz, in order to make his receiving apparatus resonant to the particular frequency radiated by the transmitter, carefully determined the capacity of both, and indeed
disclosed a means of adjusting the capacity of the receiver
by attaching to it wires whose length could readily be
varied. Marconi in his prior patent No. 586,193, granted
July 13, 1897, which became reissue No. 11,913, had disclosed a two-circuit system for the transmission of radio
waves in which both transmitter and receiver had large
metal plates serving as capacity areas. His specifications
describe the construction of transmitting and receiving
stations so as to be resonant to the same frequency by
calculation of the length of these metal plates, thereby
determining the capacity of the antenna circuits of transmitter and receiver respectively. He states that the
plates are "preferably of such a length as to be electrically
tuned with the electric oscillations transmitted," and describes means of achieving this result so as to determine
"the length most appropriate to the length of wave
emitted by the oscillator." Claim 24 of his patent claims
"the combination of a transmitter capable of producing
electrical oscillations or rays of definite character at the

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

will of the operator, and a receiver located at a distance
and having a conductor tuned to respond to such oscillations . . ." The only means of achieving this tuning

disclosed by the specifications is the determination of the
capacity of the antenna of transmitter and receiver in the
manner described.
Moreover the use of an adjustable condenser as a means
of tuning was known to the prior art. Pupin in patent
No. 640,516, applied for May 28, 1895, and granted January 2, 1900, before Marconi, disclosed the use of an adjustable condenser as a means of tuning a receiving circuit in a system of wired telegraphy. Pupin's patent was
designed to permit the simultaneous transmission over a
wire of several messages at different frequencies, and the
selective reception at a given receiving station of the particular message desired, by tuning the receiving circuit to
the frequency at which that message was transmitted.
His specifications and drawings disclose at the receiver a
telegraph key or other suitable detecting instrument located in a shunt from the wire along which the messages
were passed. The shunt circuit included a condenser "of
adjustable capacity," an adjustable induction coil, and a
detecting instrument. His specifications state that "the
capacity of the condenser H and the self-induction of the
[induction] coil I being such that the natural period or
frequency of the shunt or resonance circuit HI is the same
as the period of one of the electromotive forces which produce the current coming over the line . . . this circuit

HI will be in resonance with the current and therefore
will act selectively with respect to it." He disclosed an
alternative system in which a similar shunt circuit containing a condenser, already described as of adjustable
capacity, and the primary of a transformer, was inductively coupled with another circuit containing the secondary of the transformer, an induction coil, an adjustable
condenser, and a receiving device. He thus in effect dis-

Opinion of the Court.

closed an open receiving circuit with earth connection including the primary of an oscillation transformer-the
secondary of which is connected in a circuit with a telegraph key or other suitable detecting instrument-and
an adjustable condenser in a shunt bridging the primary
of the transformer and thus connected in parallel with it.
Thus Pupin showed the use of an adjustable condenser
as a means of tuning an electrical circuit so as to be selectively receptive to impulses of a particular frequency. It
is true that his patent related not to the radio art but to
the art of wired telegraphy, an art which employed much
lower frequencies. But so far as we are informed the
principles of resonance, and the methods of achieving it,
applicable to the low frequencies used by Pupin are the
same as those applicable to high frequency radio transmission and reception.
Fessenden, in patent No. 706,735, applied for Dec. 15,
1899, before Marconi, and granted Aug. 12, 1902, disclosed,
in the antenna circuit of a radio receiver, a condenser in
a shunt around a coil. The coil was used in effect as a
transformer; by the magnetic lines of force set up when
a current passed through it an indicator was caused to
move, thereby either closing an electrical connection or
giving a visible signal. Fessenden's specifications do not
clearly disclose the purpose of his condenser, but they
specify that it must be "of the proper size." He also discloses a condenser in a shunt circuit around the terminals
of a spark gap in the antenna circuit of the transmitter,
and his specifications prescribe that "This shunt-circuit
must be tuned to the receiving-conductor; otherwise the
oscillations produced by it will have no action upon the
wave-responsive device at the receiving-station."
We have referred to the Pupin and Fessenden patents,
not for the purpose of determining whether they anticipate Claim 16 of Marconi, as the Government insists, but
to indicate the importance of considering them in that

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

aspect, together with the relevant testimony, which the
court below did not do. In the present state of the record we do not undertake to determine whether and to
what extent these disclosures either anticipate Claim 16
of the Marconi patent or require that claim to be so narrowly construed that defendants' accused devices or some
of them do not infringe Marconi.
Although the Pupin and Fessenden patents were in the
record before the Court of Claims when it entered its decision finding Claim 16 valid and infringed, they were
not referred to in connection with Claim 16 either in the
court's opinion or in its findings, evidently because not
urged upon that court by the Government as anticipating
Claim 16. But this Court, in the exercise of its appellate
power, is not precluded from looking at any evidence of
record which, whether or not called to the attention of the
court below, is relevant to and may affect the correctness
of its decision sustaining or denying any contention which
a party has made before it. Muncie GearCo. v. Outboard
Motor Co., 315 U. S. 759, 766-8; Act of May 22, 1939, 28
U. S. C. ยง 288; cf. Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552,
556.
In order to determine whether this Court should consider the evidence which the Government now presses
upon it, and should on the basis of that evidence either
decide for itself whether Claim 16 is valid and infringed
or remand that question to the Court of Claims for further
consideration, it is necessary to set out in some detail the
relevant proceedings below. The case was referred to a
special commissioner for the taking of testimony under
a stipulation that the issue of reasonable compensation
for damages and profits be postponed until the determination of the issues of validity and infringement. On June
26, 1933, the Commissioner filed a report in which he
made the following findings with regard to Claim 16,
which the Court of Claims later adopted in substance:

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
Opinion of the Court.

"LXII. Claim 16 of Marconi #763772 is directed to
subject matter which is new and useful . . .
"LXV. The receiving apparatus of the Kilbourne &
Clark Company, shown in exhibit 95, and the receiver
made by the Telefunken company, illustrated in exhibit
79, each has apparatus coming within the terminology of
claim 16."
Both parties filed exceptions to the Commissioner's report. The Marconi Company excepted to part of finding
LXII, and took several exceptions which were formally
addressed to finding LXV. The Government, in a memorandum, opposed the suggested amendments to these
findings.

But the Government filed no exceptions to

these two findings, nor did it, in its extensive brief before the Court of Claims, make any contention that Claim
16 either is invalid or was not infringed.
After the court had rendered its interlocutory decision
holding Claim 16 valid and infringed, the case was sent
back to the Commissioner to take evidence on the accounting. Much evidence was taken bearing on the function
served by the condenser in the arrangement described in
Claim 16 and in the Government's receivers, and in that
connection the Pupin and Fessenden patents were again
introduced in evidence by the Government. When the
Pupin patent was offered the Commissioner stated: "Obviously, as I understand the offer of this patent of Pupin,
it does not in any way attack the validity of Claim 16 of
the Marconi patent in suit. As you state Mr. Blackmar,
that has been decided by the Court, and I do not recall
just now what procedure was followed after the decision
and prior to this accounting proceeding; but
the defendant had at that time opportunity for a motion for a new
trial and presentation of newly-discovered evidence and all
those matters." Accordingly, the Commissioner stated
that he received the patent in evidence "for the sole purpose of aiding the witness and the Commissioner and the

46

320 U. S.

Court in an understanding of how the condenser in the
Marconi patent operates." And in offering the Fessenden patent counsel for the Government similarly stated
that it was offered "not to show invalidity but as showing
justification for the defendant's use."
In its exceptions to the Commissioner's report on the
accounting the Government asked the Court of Claims
to make certain specific findings as to the mode of operation of the arrangements disclosed in the Pupin and Fessenden patents, and also to find that
"The mode of connecting the primary condenser in parallel with the antenna-to-earth capacity used by the defendant followed the disclosure of Pupin 640,516 and the
Fessenden patent 706,735 . . .and hence does not infringe the Marconi claim 16 which is based upon a different arrangement, operating in a different manner to obtain a different result."
The Government contended that there was no finding of
fact that Claim 16 had been infringed, and that the court,
in the course of the accounting proceeding had by an
order of October 22, 1937, reopened the entire subject of
infringement. We agree with the court that the Commissioner's finding LXV, which the court adopted as finding LXIII, was a finding of infringement, and we see no
reason to question the court's conclusion that its order
had not reopened the subject of infringement.
In view, however, of the Government's apparent misunderstanding of the scope of the issues left open on the
accounting we think that its request for a finding of noninfringement specifically addressed to the Pupin and Fessenden patents was a sufficient request to the court to
reconsider its previous decision of infringement. And
while most of the argument on the Government's exceptions to the Commissioner's report was based on evidence
taken upon the accounting, the Government's briefs suf-

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
1

Opinion of the Court.

ficiently disclosed to the court that the Pupin and Fessenden patents, at least, had been in the record prior to
the interlocutory decision.
The court, in rejecting the Government's request for a
finding of non-infringement, stated: "The question of infringement of Marconi Claim 16 . . . is not before us

in the present accounting." "The sole purpose and function of an accounting in a patent infringement case is to
ascertain the amount of compensation due, and no other
issue can be brought into the accounting to change or
alter the court's prior decision." We cannot say with
certainty whether in rejecting the Government's request
the court thought that it lacked power to reconsider its
prior decision, or whether it held merely that in the exercise of its discretion it should not do so. Nor does it appear that, assuming it considered the question to be one
of discretion, it recognized that in part at least the Government's request was based on evidence, having an important bearing on the validity and construction of Claim
16, which had been before the court but had not been considered by it when it held Claim 16 valid and infringed.
Although the interlocutory decision of the Court of
Claims on the question of validity and infringement was
appealable, United States v. Esnault-Pelterie,299 U. S.
201, 303 U. S. 26; 28 U. S. C. ยง 288 (b), as ate interlocutory
orders of district courts in suits to enjoin infringment, 28

of the accounting. Barnard v. Gibson, 7 How. 649;
Humiston v. Stainthorp, 2 Wall. 106; Simmons Co. v.
Grier Bros. Co., supra, 89. Hence the court did not lack
power at any time prior to entry of its final judgment at
the close of the accounting to reconsider any portion of
its decision and reopen any part of the case. Perkins v.
Fourniquet, 6 How. 206, 208; McGou'key v. Toledo &

v. Grier Bros. Co., supra, 90-91. It was free in its discretion to grant a reargument based either on all the evi-

dence then of record or only the evidence before the
court when it rendered its interlocutory decision, or to
reopen the case for further evidence.
Whether it should have taken any of these courses was
a matter primarily for its discretion, to be exercised in
the light of various considerations which this Court cannot properly appraise without more intimate knowledge
than it has of the proceedings in a long and complex trial.
Among those considerations are the questions whether, as
appears to be the case from such portions of the record
as have been filed in this Court or cited to us by counsel,
the Government failed to make any contention as to the
validity or construction of Claim 16 in the proceedings
leading to the interlocutory decision; whether the showing of non-infringement which it now makes is sufficiently
strong, and the public interest that an invalid patent be
not sustained is sufficiently great, to justify reconsidering
the decision as to Claim 16 despite the failure of Government counsel to press its contention at the proper time;
whether adequate consideration of the question of noninfringement can be had on the existing record, or whether
additional testimony should be received; and whether,
balancing the strength or weakness of the Government's
present showing of non-infringement against the undesirability of further prolonging this already extended litigation, the case is one which justifies reconsideration.
These are all matters requiring careful consideration by
the trial court. In order that the case may receive that
consideration, we vacate the judgment as to Claim 16 and
remand the cause to -the Court of Claims for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.
If on the remand the court should either decline to reconsider its decision of infringement, or should upon reconsideration adhere to that decision, it should pass upon

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the contention of the Government, urged here and below,
as to the measure of damages, with respect to which the
court made no findings. The Government's contention
is that the variable capacity shunt of the accused devices
bridged all the inductance in the receiving antenna circuit,
and that even though those devices infringed they nevertheless embody an improvement over Marconi's Claim 16,
in which only the transformer coil was bridged. In computing the damages the court measured them by 65% of
the cost to the Government of the induction coils which
would be required to replace in the accused devices the adjustable condensers as a means of tuning, taking into account the greater convenience and efficiency of condenser
tuning. The allowance of only 65% was on the theory
that if the parties had negotiated for the use of the
invention the price would have been less than the cost
to the Government of the available alternative means of
tuning.
In computing the damages the court apparently did
not take into account or attempt to appraise any contribution which may have been made by the improvement
over Marconi which the Government asserts was included
in the accused devices. The court found that where the
condenser is connected in series with the inductance coils
in the antenna it "can be used to shorten the natural
resonant wave length of the antenna circuit but cannot
lengthen it beyond what would be the resonant wave
length if the condenser were not present." On the other
hand, it found that when the condenser is connected in
parallel it enables the periodicity of the antenna to be
lowered, permitting the reception of longer wave-lengths.
The computation of damages was based on the premise
that the advantage to the Government resulting from the
infringement was derived from the ability which the accused devices had thus acquired to receive longer wavelengths. But there was substantial testimony that the ar-

rangement disclosed by Marconi's specifications was in
effect a connection in series which did not make possible
reception of longer wave-lengths, as did the arrangement
in the accused devices. And the court nowhere found
that the arrangement covered by Marconi's Claim 16 did
make possible such reception. The appropriate effect to
be given to this testimony is important in the light of the
recognized doctrine that if a defendant has added "noninfringing and valuable improvements which had contributed to the making of the profits," it is not liable for benefits resulting from such improvements. Westinghouse
Electric Co. v. Wagner Mfg. Co., 225 U. S. 604, 614-15,
616-17; Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Corp., 309 U. S. 390,
402-406, and cases cited. Finding LXIII that the Government was using "apparatus coming within the terminology
of Claim 16," and Finding 23 on the accounting that the
accused devices "infringe Claim 16 of the Marconi patent," give no aid in solving this problem for they are not
addressed to the question whether, assuming infringement,
the Government has made improvements which of themselves are non-infringing. That can only be afforded by
findings which appraise the evidence, establish the scope
of Marconi's claim and the nature and extent of the difference in function, if any, between the device claimed by
Marconi and those used by the Government, and determine whether any differences shown to exist constitute
a "non-infringing improvement" for which Marconi
deserves no credit.
The judgment as to Claim 16 will be vacated and the
cause remanded for further proceedings.
The FlemingPatent No. 803,684.
The Fleming patent, entitled: "Instrument for Converting Alternating Electric Currents into Continuous
Currents" was applied for April 19, 1905, and granted on
November 7, 1905 to the Marconi Company, as assignee

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of Fleming. Its specifications state that "this invention
relates to certain new and useful devices for converting
alternating electric currents, and especially high-frequency
alternating electric currents or electric oscillations, into
continuous electric currents for the purpose of making
them detectable by and measurable with ordinary directcurrent instruments, such as a 'mirror-galvanometer' of
the usual type or any ordinary direct-current ammeter."
Fleming's drawings and specifications show a combination
apparatus by which alternating current impulses received
through an antenna circuit containing the primary of a
transformer are induced in the secondary of the transformer. To one end of the secondary coil is connected a
carbon filament like that of an incandescent electric lamp,
which is heated by a battery. Surrounding, but not
touching the filament, is a cylinder of aluminum open at
the top and bottom, which is connected with the other
end of the secondary. The cylinder and filament are enclosed in an evacuated vessel such as an ordinary electric
lamp bulb. An indicating instrument or galvanometer
is so located in this circuit as to respond to the flow of
current in it. The specifications explain the operation of
this device:
"This arrangement described above operates as an electric valve and permits negative electricity to flow from
the hot carbon b to the metal cylinder c, but not in the
reverse direction, so that the alternations induced in the
coil k by the Hertzian waves received by the aerial wire
n are rectified or transformed into a more or less continuous current capable of actuating the galvanometer I by
which the signals can be read."
The specifications further state:
"....

the aerial wire n may be replaced by any circuit

in which there is an alternating electromotive force,
whether of low frequency or of high frequency ..."

52

"Hence the device may be used for rectifying either
high-frequency or low-frequency alternating currents of
electrical oscillations . .."
Only Claims 1 and 37 of the patent are in suit. They
read as follows:
"1. The combination of a vacuous vessel, two conductors
adjacent to but not touching each other in the vessel,
means for heating one of the conductors, and a circuit outside the vessel connecting the two conductors.
"37. At a receiving-station in a system of wireless telegraphy employing electrical oscillations of high frequency
a detector comprising a vacuous vessel, two conductors
adjacent to but not touching each other in the vessel,
means for heating one of the conductors, a circuit outside
of the vessel connecting the two conductors, means for detecting a continuous current in the circuit, and means for
impressing upon the circuit the received oscillations."
The current applied to the filament or cathode by the
battery sets up a flow of electrons (negative electric
charges) from the heated cathode, which are attracted to
the cold plate or anode when the latter is positively
charged. When an alternating current is set up in the
circuit containing the cathode, anode, and secondary of
the transformer, the electronic discharge from the cathode
closes the circuit and permits a continuous flow of electricity through it when the phase of the current is such
that the anode is positively charged, while preventing any
flow of current through the tube when the anode is negatively charged. The alternating current is thus rectified
so as to produce a current flowing only in one direction.
See DeForestRadio Co. v. General Electric Co., 283 U. S.
664; Radio Corporationv. Radio Laboratories,293 U. S. 1;
Detrola Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Corporation,313 U. S.
259.
Claims 1 and 37 of the Fleming patent are identical in
their structural elements. Both claim the vacuum tube,

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
I

Opinion of the Court.

and the two electrodes connected by a circuit outside the
tube, one element being heated. The claims differ only
in that Claim 37 includes "means for detecting" the continuous or direct current in the anode-cathode circuit, and
"means for impressing upon the circuit the received oscillations" from the transformer coil of the antenna circuit.
In the patent as originally issued there had been another
difference between the two claims. Claim 37 describes the
tube as being used "in a system of wireless telegraphy employing electrical oscillations of high frequency." No such
limitation was placed on Claim 1 as originally claimed, and
the specifications already quoted plainly contemplated
the use of the claimed device with low as well as high
frequency currents. This distinction was eliminated by
a disclaimer filed by the Marconi Company November 17,
1915, restricting the combination of the elements of Claim
I to a use "inconnection with high frequency alternating
electric currents or electric oscillations of the order employed in Hertzian wave transmission," and deleting certain references to low frequencies in the specifications.
The result of the disclaimer was to limit both claims to the
use of the patented device for rectifying high frequency
alternating waves or currents such as were employed in
wireless telegraphy.
The earliest date asserted for Fleming's invention, as
limited by the disclaimer, is November 16, 1904. Twenty
years before, on October 21, 1884, Edison had secured
United States Patent No. 307,031. In his specifications
he stated:
"I have discovered that if a conducting substance is interposed anywhere in the vacuous space within the globe
of an incandescent electric lamp, and said conducting substance is connected outside of the lamp with one terminal,
preferably the positive one, of the incandescent conductor,
a portion of the current will, when the lamp is in opera-

320 U. S.

tion, pass through the shunt-circuit thus formed, which
shunt includes a portion of the vacuous space within the
lamp. This current I have found to be proportional to
the degree of incandescence of the conductor or candlepower of the lamp."
Edison proposed to use this discovery as a means of "indicating, variations in the electro-motive force in an electric circuit," by connecting a lamp thus equipped at a
point where the current was to be measured. The drawings of his patent show an electric circuit, including a
filament (cathode) and a plate (anode) both "in the
vacuous space within the globe"-an electric light bulb.
The shunt-circuit extends from the plate through a galvanometer to the filament. His specifications disclose
that the vacuous space within the globe is a conductor
of current between the plate anode and the filament; that
the strength of the current in the filament-to-plate circuit
through the vacuum depends upon the degree of incandescence at the filament; and that the plate anode is
preferably connected to the positive side of the current
supply. The claims of the patent are for the combination
of the filament, plate and interconnezting circuit, including the galvanometer. Claim 5, a typical claim, reads
as follows:
"The combination, with an incandescent electric lamp,
of a circuit having one terminal in the vacuous space
within the globe of said lamp, and the other connected
with one side of the lamp-circuit, and electrically controlled or operated apparatus in said circuit, substantially
as set forth."
The structure disclosed in Fleming's Claims 1 and 37
thus differed in no material respect from that disclosed
by Edison. Since Fleming's original Claim 1 is merely
for the structure, it reads directly on Edison's Claim 5
and could not be taken as invention over it.

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
Opinion of the Court.

Fleming used this structure for a different purpose than
Edison. Edison disclosed that his device operated to
pass a current across the vacuous space within the tube
between filament and plate. He used this current as a
means of measuring the current passing through the filament circuit. Fleming, in his specifications, disclosed
the use of his tube as a rectifier of alternating currents,
and in Claim 37 he claimed the use of that apparatus as
a means of rectifying alternating currents of radio frequency. But in this use of the tube to convert alternating into direct currents there was no novelty for it had
been disclosed by others and by Fleming himself long
before Fleming's invention date.
On January 9, 1890, ten years before Fleming filed his
application, he stated in a paper read before the Royal
Society of London:
"It has been known for some time that if a platinum
plate or wire is sealed through the glass bulb of an ordinary
carbon filament incandescent lamp, this metallic plate
being quite out of contact with the carbon conductor, a
sensitive galvanometer connected between this insulated
metal plate enclosed in the vacuum and the external positive electrode of the lamp indicates a current of some milliamperes passing through it when the lamp is set in
action, but the same instrument when connected between
the negative electrode of the lamp and the insulated metal
plate indicates no sensible current. This phenomenon
in carbon incandescence lamps was first observed by Mr.
Edison, in 1884, and further examined by Mr. W. H.
Preece, in 1885." Proceedings of the Royal Society of
London, vol. 47, pp. 118-9.
Fleming's 1890 paper further pointed out that the
vacuous space "possesses a curious unilateral conductivity"; that is, it permits current to "flow across the vacuous
space from the hot carbon [cathode]to the cooler metal
plate [anode], but not in the reverse direction." Id. 122.

56

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

320 U. 8.

He noted the ability of the tube to act as a rectifier of
alternating current, saying:
"When the lamp is actuated by an alternating current
a continuous current is found flowing through a galvanometer, connected between the insulated plate and either
terminal of the lamp. The direction of the current
through the galvanometer is such as to show that negative
electricity is flowing from the plate through the galvanometer to the lamp terminal." Id. 120.
Fleming's paper thus noted, contrary to the then popular conception, that it is negative electricity which flows
from cathode to anode, but he emphasized that even this
had been a part of general scientific knowledge, as
follows:
"The effect of heating the negative electrode in facilitating discharge through vacuous spaces has previously been
described by W. Hittorf ('Annalen der Physik und
Chemie,' vol. 21, 1884, p. 90-139), and it is abundantly confirmed by the above experiments. We may say that a
vacuous space bounded by two electrodes--one incandescent, and the other cold-possesses a unilateral conductivity for electric discharge when these electrodes are within a distance of the mean free path of projection of the
molecules which the impressed electromotive force can
detach and send off from the hot negative electrode.
"This unilateral conductivity of vacuous spaces having
unequally heated electrodes has been examined by MM.
Elster and Geitel (see 'Wiedemann's Annalen,' vol. 38,
1889, p. 40), and also by Goldstein ('Wied. Ann.,' vol. 24,
1885, p. 83), who in experiments of various kinds have
demonstrated that when an electric discharge across a
vacuous space takes place from a carbon conductor to
another electrode, the discharge takes place at lower electromotive force when the carbon conductor is the negative
electrode and is rendered incandescent." Id. 125-6.

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
Opinion of the Court.

Fleming's reference in this publication to the unilateral
conductivity of the vacuous space between cathode and
anode, and the consequent ability of the two to derive a
continuous unidirectional current from an alternating
current was a recognition that the Edison tube embodying the structure described could be used as a rectifier of
alternating current. This knowledge, disclosed by publication more than two years before Fleming's application, was a bar to any claim for a patent for an invention
embodying the published disclosure. R.S. ยงยง 4886,4920;
35 U. S. C. ยงยง 31, 69. Wagner v. Meccano Ltd., 246 F. 603,
607; cf. Muncie Gear Co. v. Outboard Co., supra, 766.
It is unnecessary to decide whether Fleming's use of
the Edison device for the purpose of rectifying high frequency Hertzian waves, as distinguished from low frequency waves, involved invention over the prior art, or
whether the court below rightly held that the devices
used by the Government did not infringe the claims sued
upon, for we are of the opinion that the court was right
in holding that Fleming's patent was rendered invalid by
an improper disclaimer. It is plain that Fleming's original Claim 1, so far as applicable to use with low frequency
alternating currents, involved nothing new, as Fleming
himself must have known in view of his 1890 paper, and
as he recognized by his disclaimer in 1915, made twentyfive years after his paper was published and ten years
after his patent had been allowed. Its invalidity would
defeat the entire patent unless the invalid portion had
been claimed "through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention,"
and was also disclaimed without "unreasonable" neglect
or delay. R. S. ยงยง 4917, 4922; 35 U. S. C. ยงยง 65, 71;

58

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

320 U. S.

We need not stop to inquire whether, as the Government contends, the subject matter of the disclaimer was
improper as in effect adding a new element to the claim.
See Milcor Steel Co. v. Fuller Co., 316 U. S. 143, 147-8.
For we think that the court below was correct in holding
that the Fleming patent was invalid because Fleming's
claim for "more than he had invented" was not inadvertent, and his delay in making the disclaimer was "unreasonable." Both of these are questions of fact, but since
the court in its opinion plainly states its conclusions as
to them, and those conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, its omission to make formal findings of fact
is immaterial. Act of May 22, 1939, 53 Stat. 752, 28 U. S.
C. ยง 288 (b); cf. American PropellerCo. v. United States,
300 U. S. 475, 479-80; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.
Huffman, 319 U. S. 293.
The purpose of the rule that a patent is invalid in its
entirety if any part of it be invalid is the protection of
the public from the threat of an invalid patent, and the
purpose of the disclaimer statute is to enable the patentee
to relieve himself from the consequences of making an invalid claim if he is able to show both that the invalid claim
was inadvertent and that the disclaimer was made without
unreasonable neglect or delay. Ensten v. Simon Ascher
& Co., supra. Here the patentee has sustained neither
burden.
Fleming's paper of 1890 showed his own recognition
that his claim of use of his patent for low frequency currents was anticipated by Edison and others. It taxes credulity to suppose, in the face of this publication, that
Fleming's claim for use of the Edison tube with low frequency currents was made "through inadvertence, accident or mistake," which is prerequisite to a lawful disclaimer. No explanation or excuse is forthcoming for his
claim of invention of a device which he had so often dem-

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

onstrated to be old in the art, and which he had specifically
and consistently attributed to Edison. Nor is any explanation offered for the delay of the patentee-the Marconi Company-in waiting ten years to disclaim the use
of the device with low frequency currents and to restrict
it to a use with high frequency Hertzian waves which Edison had plainly foreshadowed but not claimed. For ten
years the Fleming patent was held out to the public as a
monopoly of all its claimed features. That was too long
in the absence of any explanation or excuse for the delay,
and hence in this case was long enough to invalidate the
patent. The conclusion of the Court of Claims not only
has support in the evidence, but we can hardly see how on
this record any other could have been reached.
The Marconi Company's contention that it nowhere
appears that Fleming was not the first inventor of the use
of the patented device to rectify high frequency alternating currents is irrelevant to the question of the sufficiency of the disclaimer. The disclaimer itself is an assertion that the claimed use of the invention with low
frequencies was not the invention of the patentee, whose
rights were derived wholly from Fleming. This improper
claim for something not the invention of the patentee
rendered the whole patent invalid unless saved by a timely
disclaimer which was not made.
TheMarconi Company also asserts that, as it is suing as
assignee of the patentee, it is unaffected by the provisions
of the disclaimer statutes, which it construes as restricting
to the "patentee" the consequences of unreasonable delay
in making the disclaimer and as exempting the assignee
from those consequences by the sentence "But no patentee
shall be entitled to the benefits of this section if he has
unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter a disclaimer."
35 U. S. C. 71. As the court below found, the Marconi
Company was itself the patentee to whom the patent was

issued on the assignment of Fleming's application in conformity to 35 U. S. C. ยง 44. The right given by ยง 71 to
the patentee or his assignees to sue for infringement upon
a proper disclaimer obviously does not relieve the patentee
from the consequences of his failure to comply with the
statute because he acquired his patent under an assignment of the application. Altoona Theatres v. Tri-Ergon
Corp., supra; Maytag Co. v. Hurley Co., supra; France
Mfg. Co. v. Jefferson Electric'Co.,106 F. 2d 605,610. Such
a contention is not supported by the words of the statute
and if allowed would permit the nullification of the disclaimer statute by the expedient of an assignment of the
application. We need not consider whether one who has
taken an assignment of a patent after its issuance would
have any greater rights than his assignor in the event of
the latter's undue delay in filing a disclaimer. Compare

them vigilant against importing their own notions of the
nature of the creative procesi into Congressional legislation, whereby Congress "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" has secured "for limited Times to
. . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries." Above all, judges must avoid the subtle temptation of taking scientific phenomena out of their contemporaneous setting and reading them with a retrospective
eye.
The discoveries of science are the discoveries of the laws
of nature, and like nature do not go by leaps. Even
Newton and Einstein, Harvey and Darwin, built on the
past and on their predecessors. Seldom indeed has a
great discoverer or inventor wandered lonely as a cloud.
Great inventions have always been parts of an evolution,
the culmination at a particular moment of an antecedent
process. So true is this that the history of thought records striking coincidental discoveries-showing that the
new insight first declared to the world by a particular individual was "in the air" and ripe for discovery and
disclosure.
The real question is how significant a jump is the new
disclosure from the old knowledge. Reconstruction by
hindsight, making obvious something that was not at all
obvious to superior minds until someone pointed it out,this is too often a tempting exercise for astute minds. The
result is to remove the opportunity of obtaining what
Congress has seen fit to make available.
The inescapable fact is that Marconi in his basic patent
hit upon something that had eluded the best brains of
the time working on the problem of wireless communication--Clerk Maxwell and Sir Oliver Lodge and Nikola
Tesla. Genius is a word that ought to be reserved for
the rarest of gifts. I am not qualified to say whether
Marconi was a genius. Certainly the great eminence of
Clerk Maxwell and Sir Oliver Lodge and Nikola Tesla

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

in the field in which Marconi was working is not questioned. They were, I suppose, men of genius. The fact
is that they did not have the "flash" (a current term in
patent opinions happily not used in this decision) that
begot the idea in Marconi which he gave to the world
through the invention embodying the idea. But it is
now held that in the important advance upon his basic
patent Marconi did nothing that had not already been
seen and disclosed.
To find in 1943 that what Marconi did really did not
promote the progress of science because it had been anticipated is more than a mirage of hindsight. Wireless is
so unconscious a part of us, like the automobile to the
modern child, that it is almost impossible to imagine ourselves back into the time when Marconi gave to the world
what for us is part of the order of our universe. And yet,
because a judge of unusual capacity for understanding
scientific matters is able to demonstrate by a process of intricate ratiocination that anyone could have drawn precisely the inferences that Marconi drew and that Stone
hinted at on paper, the Court finds that Marconi's
patent was invalid although nobody except Marconi did
in fact draw the right inferences that were embodied into
a workable boon for mankind. For me it speaks volumes
that it should have taken forty years to reveal the fatal
bearing of Stone's relation to Marconi's achievement by
a retrospective reading of his application to mean this
rather than that. This is for me, and I say it with much
diffidence, too easy a transition from what was not to
what became.
I have little doubt, in so far as I am entitled to express
an opinion, that the vast transforming forces of technology have rendered obsolete much in our patent law. For
all I know the basic assumption of our patent law may be
false, and inventors and their financial backers do not
need the incentive of a limited monopoly to stimulate

By present knowledge, it would be no more. School
boys and mechanics now could perform what Marconi did
in 1900. But before then wizards had tried and failed.
The search was at the pinnacle of electrical knowledge.
There, seeking, among others, were Tesla, Lodge and
Stone, old hands and great ones. With them was Marconi, still young as the company went B obsessed with
youth's zeal for the hunt.
At such an altitude, to work at all with success is to
qualify for genius, if that is important. And a short step
forward gives evidence of inventive power. For at that
height a merely slight advance comes through insight
only a first-rate mind can produce. This is so, whether
it comes by years of hard work tracking down the sought
secret or by intuition flashed from subconsciousness made
fertile by long experience or shorter intensive concentration. At this level and in this company Marconi worked
and won.
He won by the test of results. No one disputes this.
His invention had immediate and vast success, where all
that had been done before, including his own work, gave
but narrowly limited utility. To make useful improvement at this plane, by such a leap, itself shows high capacity. And that is true, although it was inherent in the
situation that Marconi's success should come by only a
small margin of difference in conception. There was not
room for any great leap of thought, beyond what he and

tical success. The invention was, so to speak, hovering
in the general climate of science, momentarily awaiting
birth. But just the right releasing touch had not been
found. Marconi added it.
When to altitude of the plane of conception and results
so immediate and useful is added well-nigh unanimous
contemporary judgment, one who long afterward would
overturn the invention assumes a double burden. He
undertakes to overcome what would offer strong resistance fresh in its original setting. He seeks also to overthrow the verdict of time. Long-range retroactive diagnosis, however competent the physician, becomes hazardous by progression as the passing years add distortions of
the past and destroy its perspective. No light task is accepted therefore in undertaking to overthrow a verdict
settled so long and so well, and especially one so foreign
to the art of judges.
In lawyers' terms this means a burden of proof, not insurmountable, but inhospitable to implications and inferences which in less settled situations would be permissible to swing the balance of judgment against the claimed
invention. That Marconi received patents elsewhere
which, once established, have stood the test of time as
well as of contemporary judgment, and secured his American patent only after years were required to convince our
office he had found what so many others sought, but emphasizes the weight and clarity of proof required to overcome his claim.
Marconi received patents here, in England, and in
France.' The American patent was not issued perfunctorily. It came forth only after a long struggle had
brought about reversal of the Patent Office's original and
later rejections. The application was filed in November,

1900. In December it was rejected on Lodge,' and an
earlier patent to Marconi.' It was amended and again rejected. Further amendments followed and operation of
the system was explained. Again rejection took place,
this time on Lodge, the earlier Marconi, Braun and other
patents. After further proceedings, the claims were rejected on Tesla.' A year elapsed, but in March, 1904,
reconsideration was granted. Some claims then were rejected on Stone,10 others were amended, still others were
cancelled, and finally on June 28, 1904, the patent issued.
French and British patents had been granted in 1900.
Litigation followed at once. Among Marconi's American victories were the decisions cited above. 1 Abroad
the results were similar.2 Until 1935, when the Court of
Claims held it invalid in this case, 81 Ct. Cl. 671, no court
had found Marconi's patent wanting in invention. It
stood without adverse judicial decision for over thirty
years. In the face of the burden this history creates, we
turn to the references, chiefly Tesla, Lodge and Stone.
The Court relies principally on Stone, but without deciding whether this was inventive.
It is important, in considering the references, to state
the parties' contentions concisely. The Government's
statement is that they differ over whether Marconi was
first to conceive four-circuit "tuning" for transmission of
sound by Hertzian waves. It says this was taught previously by Tesla, Lodge and Stone. Petitioner however
says none of them taught what Marconi did. It contends
that Marconi was the first to accomplish the kind of tun' British patent to Lodge No. 29,505.

ing he achieved, and in effect urges this was patentably
different from other forms found earlier.
Specifically petitioner urges that Tesla had nothing to
do with either Hertzian waves or tuning, but in fact his
transmitting and receiving wires could not be tuned. '
Lodge, it claims, disclosed a tuned antenna, for either
transmitter or receiver or both, but the closed circuits
associated with the antenna ones were not tuned. Finally
it is said Stone does not describe tuning the antenna, but
does show tuning of the associated closed circuit. And
Marconi tuned both.
Petitioner does not claim the general principles of
tuning. It admits they had long been familiar to physicists and that Lodge and others fully understood them.
But it asserts Lodge did not know what circuits should
be tuned, to accomplish what Marconi achieved, and that,
to secure this, "knowledge that tuning is possible is not
enough-there is also required the knowledge of whether
or not to tune and how much."
Likewise, petitioner does not deny that Stone knew and
utilized the principles of tuning; but urges, with respect
to the claim he applied them to all of the four circuits, that
the only ones tuned, in his original application, were the
closed circuits and therefore that the antenna circuits
were not tuned; although it is not denied that the effects
of tuning the closed circuits were reflected in the open
ones by what Stone describes as "producing forced simple

1 Tesla in fact did not use Hertzian waves. His idea was to make

the ether a conductor for long distances by using extremely high
voltage, 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 volts, and extremely high altitudes,
30,000 to 40,000 feet or more, to secure transmission from aerial to
aerial. Balloons, with wires attached reaching to the ground, were
his suggested aerials. His system was really one for transmitting
power for motors, lighting, etc., to "any terrestrial distance," though
he incidentally mentions "intelligible messages." As he did not use
Hertzian waves, he had no such problem of selectivity as Marconi,
Lodge, Stone and others were working on later.

harmonic electric vibrations of the same periodicity in an
elevated conductor."
The Stone amendments of 1902, made more than a year
after Marconi's filing date, admittedly disclose tuning of
both the closed and the open circuits, and were made for
the purpose of stating expressly the latter effect, claimed
to be implicit in the original application. Petitioner
denies this was implicit and argues, in effect, that what
Stone originally meant by "producing forced . . . vibra-

tions" was creating the desired effects in the antenna
by force, not by tuning; and therefore that the two methods were patentably different.
It seems clear that the parties use the word "tuning"
to mean different things and the ambiguity, if there is one,
must be resolved before the crucial questions can be stated
with meaning. It will aid, in deciding whether there is
ambiguity or only confusion, to consider the term and the
possible conceptions it may convey in the light of the
problems Marconi and Stone, as well as other references,
were seeking to solve.
Marconi had in mind first a specific difficulty, as did the
principal references. It arose from what, to the time of
his invention, had been a baffling problem in the art.
Shortly and simply, it was that an electrical circuit which
is a good conserver of energy is a bad radiator and, conversely, a good radiator is a bad conserver of energy.
Effective use of Hertzian waves over long distances required both effects. To state the matter differently,
Lodge had explained in 1894 the difficulties of fully utilizing the principle of sympathetic resonance in detecting
ether waves. To secure this, it was necessary, on the one
hand, to discharge a long series of waves of equal or approximately equal length. Such a series can be produced
only by a circuit which conserves its energy well, what
Marconi calls a persistent oscillator. On the other hand,
for distant detection, the waves must be of substantial

amplitude, and only a circuit which loses its energy rapidly
can transmit such waves with maximum efficiency.
Obviously in a single circuit the two desired effects tend
to cancel each other, and therefore to limit the distance of
detection. Similar difficulty characterized the receiver, for
a good radiator is a good absorber, and that very quality
disables it to store up and hold the effect of a train of
waves, until enough is accumulated to break down the
coherer, as detection requires.
Since the difficulty was inherent in a single circuit,
whether at one end or the other, Marconi used two in
both transmitter and receiver, four in all. In each station he used one circuit to obtain one of the necessary
advantages and the other circuit to secure the other advantage. The antenna (or open) circuits he made "good
radiators" (or absorbers). The closed circuits he constructed as "good conservers." By coupling the two at
each end loosely he secured from their combination the
dual advantages he sought. At the transmitter, the
closed circuit, by virtue of its capacity for conserving energy, gave persistent oscillation, which passed substantially undiminished through the coupling transformer to
the "good radiator" open circuit and from it was discharged
with little loss of energy into the ether. Thence it was
picked up by the "good absorber" open circuit and passed,
without serious loss of energy, through the coupling transformer, into the closed "good conserving" circuit, where
it accumulated to break the coherer and give detection.
Moreover, and for present purposes this is the important
thing, Marconi brought the closed and open circuits into
almost complete harmony by placing variable inductance
in each. Through this the periodicity of the open circuit
was adjusted automatically to that of the closed one;
and, since the circuits of the receiving' station were similarly adjustable, the maximum resonance was secured
throughout the system. Marconi thus not only solved

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
I

Rum)Gz, J., dissenting.

the dilemma of a single circuit arrangement; he attained
the maximum of resonance and selectivity by providing
in each circuit independent means of tuning.
In 1911 this solution was held inventive, as against

Lodge, Marconi's prior patents, Braun and other references, in Marconiv. British Radio Tel. & Tel. Co., 27 T. L.
R. 274. Mr. Justice Parker carefully reviewed the prior
art, stated the problem, Marconi's solution, and in disposing of Braun's specification concluded it "did not contain even the remotest suggestion of the problem . .. ,
much less any suggestion bearing on its solution. . ....
As to Lodge, Mr. Justice Parker observed, referring first
to Marconi:
".. . It is important to notice that in the receiver
the mere introduction of two circuits instead of one was
no novelty. A figure in Lodge's 1897 patent shows the
open circuit of his receiving aerial linked through a transformer with a closed circuit containing the coherer, his
idea being, as he states, to leave his receiving aerial freer
to vibrate electrically without disturbance from attached
wires. This secondary circuit, as shown, is not tuned to,
nor can it be tuned to, the circuit of the aerial. This, in
my opinion, is exceedingly strong evidence that Marconi's
1900 invention was not so obvious as to deprive it of subject matter. In the literature quoted there is no trace
of the idea underlying Mr. Marconi's invention, nor, so
far as I can see, a single suggestion from which a competent engineer could arrive at this idea." (Emphasis
added.)
It was therefore clearly Mr. Justice Parker's view, in
his closer perspective to the origin of the invention and the
references he considered, that in none of them, and particularly not in Lodge or Braun, was there anticipation
of Marconi's solution.
He did not mean that the references did not apply "the
principle of resonance as between transmitter and re-

ceiver" or utilize "the principle of sympathetic resonance
for the purpose of detection of ether waves." For he expressly attributed to Lodge, in his 1894 lectures, explanation "with great exactness [of] the various difficulties attending the full utilization" of that principle. And in
referring to Marconi's first patent, of 1896, the opinion
states that Marconi "for what it was worth . . . tuned
the two circuits [i. e., the sending and receiving ones] together as Hertz had done." (Emphasis added.)
From these and other statements in the opinion it is
obvious that Mr. Justice Parker found Marconi's invention in something more than merely the application
of the "principle of resonance," or "sympathetic resonance," or its use to "tune" together the transmitting and
receiving circuits. For Marconi in his own prior inventions, Lodge and the other references, in fact all who
had constructed any system using Hertzian waves capable
of transmitting and detecting sound, necessarily had
made use, in some manner and to some extent, of "the
principle of resonance" or "sympathetic resonance."
That principle is inherent in the idea of wireless communication by Hertzian waves. So that, necessarily, all
the prior conceptions included the idea that common
periodicity must appear in all of the circuits employed.
Nor did Mr. Justice Parker's opinion find the inventive
feature in the use of two circuits instead of one, at any rate
in the receiver. For he expressly notes this in Lodge.
But he points out that Lodge added the separate circuit
"to leave his receiving aerial freer to vibrate electrically
without disturbance from attached wires." And he goes
on to note that this secondary (or closed) circuit not only
was not, but could not be, "tuned" to the aerial circuit.
And this he finds "exceedingly strong evidence" that
"Marconi's 1900 invention was not so obvious as to deprive it of subject matter." Lodge had "tuned" the antenna circuit, by placing in it a variable inductance. But

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.
RTLmD,

J., disenting.

he did not do this or accomplish the same thing by any
other device, such as a condenser, in the closed circuit.
And the fact that so eminent a scientist, the one who in fact
posed the problem and its difficulties, did not see the need
for extending this "independent tuning" (to use Marconi's
phrase) to the closed circuit, so as to bring it thus in tune
with the open one, was enough to convince Mr. Justice
Parker, and I think rightly, that what Marconi did over
Lodge was not so obvious as to be without substance.
In short, Mr. Justice Parker found the gist of Marconi's invention, not in mere application of the general
principle or principles of resonance to a four-circuit system, or in the use of four circuits or the substitution of
two for one in each or either station; but, as petitioner
now contends, in recognition of the principle that,
whether in the transmitter or the receiver, attainment of
the maximum resonance required that means for tuning
the closed to the open circuit be inserted in both. That
recognized, the method of accomplishing the adjustment
was obvious, and different methods, as by using variable
inductance or a condenser, were available. As petitioner's reply brief states the matter, "The Marconi invention was not the use of a variable inductance, nor indeed
any other specifi&,.way of tuning an antenna-before Marconi it was known that electrical circuits could be tuned
or not tuned, by inductance coils or condensers. His
broad invention was the combination of a tuned antenna
circuit and a tuned closed circuit." (Emphasis added.)
And it is only in this view that the action of the Patent
Office in finally awarding the patent to Marconi can be
explained or sustained, for it allowed claims both limited
to and not specifying variable inductance. That feature
was essential for both circuits in principle, but not in the
particular method by which Marconi accomplished it.
And it was recognition of this which eventually induced
allowance of the claims, notwithstanding the previous

74

rejections on Lodge, Stone and other references, including
all in issue here.
In the perspective of this decade, Marconi's advance,
in requiring "independent tuning," that is, positive means
of tuning located in both closed and open circuits, seems
simple and obvious. It was simple. But, as is often
true with great inventions, the simplest and therefore
generally the best solution is not obvious at the time,
though it becomes so immediately it is seen and stated.
Looking back now at Edison's light bulb one might think
it absurd that that highly useful and beneficial idea had
not been worked out long before, by anyone who knew the
elementary laws of resistance in the field of electric conduction. But it would be shocking, notwithstanding the
presently obvious character of what Edison did, for any
court now to rule he made no invention.
The same thing applies to Marconi. Though what
he did was simple, it was brilliant, and it brought big
results. Admittedly the margin of difference between
his conception and those of the references, especially
Lodge and Stone, was small. It came down to this, that
Lodge saw the need for and used means for performing
the function which variable inductance achieves in the
antenna or open circuit, Stone did the same thing in the
closed circuit, but Marconi first did it in both. Slight
as each of these steps may seem now, in departure from
the others, it is as true as it was in 1911, when Mr. Justice Parker wrote, that the very fact men of the eminence of Lodge and Stone saw the necessity of taking the
step for one circuit but not for the other is strong, if
not conclusive, evidence that taking it for both circuits
was not obvious. If this was so clearly indicated that
anyone skilled in the art should have seen it, the unanswered and I think unanswerable question remains, why
did not Lodge and Stone, both assiduously searching for
the secret and both pregminent in the field, recognize the

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

fact and make the application? The best evidence of
the novelty of Marconi's advance lies not in any judgment, scientific or lay, which could now be formed about
it. It is rather in the careful, considered and substantially contemporaneous judgments, formed and rendered
by both the patent tribunals and the courts when years
had not distorted either the scientific or the legal perspective of the day when the invention was made. All of
the references now used to invalidate Marconi were in issue, at one time or another, before these tribunals, though
not all of them were presented to each. Their unanimous conclusion, backed by the facts which have been
stated, is more persuasive than the most competent contrary opinion formed now about the matter could be.
It remains to give further attention concerning Stone.
Admittedly his original application did not require tuning,
in Marconi's sense, of the antenna circuit, though it specified this for the closed one. He included variable inductance in the latter, but not in the former. His device
therefore was, in this respect, exactly the converse of
Lodge. But it is said his omission to specify the function
(as distinguished from the apparatus which performed it)
for the antenna circuit was not important, because the
function was implicit in the specification and therefore
supported his later amendment, filed more than a year
following Marconi's date, expressly specifying this feature for the open circuit.
Substantially the same answer may be made to this as
Mr. Justice Parker made to the claim based on Lodge.
Tuning both circuits, that is, including in each independent means for variable adjustment, was the very gist of
Marconi's invention. And it was what made possible
the highly successful result. It seems strange that one
who saw not only the problem, but the complete solution,
should specify only half what was necessary to achieve
it, neglecting to mention the other and equally important

76

320 U. S.

half as well, particularly when, as is claimed, the two were
so nearly identical except for location. The very omission of explicit statement of so important and, it is claimed,
so obvious a feature is evidence it was neither obvious
nor conceived. And the force of the omission is magnified by the fact that its author, when he fully recognized
its effect, found it necessary to make amendment to include it, after the feature was expressly and fully disclosed
by another. Amendment under such circumstances,
particularly with respect to a matter which goes to the
root rather than an incident or a detail of the invention.
is always to be regarded critically and, when the foundation claimed for it is implicit existence in the original
application, as it must be, the clearest and most convincing evidence should be required when the effect is to give
priority, by backward relation, over another application
intermediately filed.
Apart from the significance of omitting to express a feature so important, I am unable to find convincing evidence
the idea was implicit in Stone as he originally filed. His
distinction between "natural" and "forced" oscillations
seems to me to prove, in the light of his original disclosure,
not that "tuning" of the antenna circuit as Marconi required this was implicit, but rather that it was not present
in that application at all. It is true he sought, as Marconi
did, to make the antenna circuit at the transmitter the
source of waves of but a single periodicity and the same
circuit at the receiver an absorber only of the waves
so transmitted. But the methods they used were not the
same. Stone's method was to provide "what are substantially forced vibrations" in the transmitter's antenna circuit and, at the receiver, to impose "between the vertical
conductor [the antenna] . . . and the translating devices
[in the closed circuit] [other] resonant circuits attuned
to the particular frequency of the electro-magnetic waves

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

I

RuTimm, J., dissenting.

which it is desired to have operate the translating devices."
(Emphasis added.) In short, he provided for "tuning,"
as Marconi did, the transmitter's closed circuit, the receiver's closed circuit and the intermediate circuits which
he interposed in the receiver between the open or antenna
one and the closed one. But nowhere did he provide for
or suggest "tuning," as Marconi did and in his meaning,
the antenna circuit of the transmitter or the antenna circuit of the receiver. For resonance in the former he depended upon the introduction, from the closed circuit, of
"substantially forced electric vibrations" and for selectivity in the latter he used the intermediate tuned circuits. Stone and Marconi used the same means for creating persistent oscillation, namely, the use of the separate
closed circuit; and in this both also developed single periodicity to the extent the variable inductance included
there and there only could do so. But while both created
persistent oscillation in the same way, Marconi went
farther than Stone with single periodicity and secured enhancement of this by placing means for tuning in the antenna circuit, which admittedly Stone nowhere expressly
required in his original application. And, since this is
the gist of the invention in issue and of the difference between the two, it will not do to dismiss this omission
merely with the statement that there is nothing to suggest
that Stone "did not desire to have those circuits tuned."
Nor in my opinion do the passages in the specifications
relied upon as "suggesting" the "independent" tuning of
the antenna circuits bear out this inference.
When Stone states that "the vertical conductor at the
transmitter station is made the source of .. .waves of

but a single periodicity," I find nothing to suggest that this
is accomplished by specially tuning that circuit, or, in fact,
anything more than that this circuit is a good conductor
sending out the single period waves forced into it from the

78

320 U.

closed circuit. The same is true of the further statement
that "the translatingapparatusat the receiving station is
caused to be selectively responsive to waves of but a single
periodicity" (which tuning the intermediate and/or closed
circuits there accomplishes), so that "the transmittingapparatuscorresponds to a tuning fork sending but a single
musical tone, and the receiving apparatuscorresponds to
an acoustic resonator capable of absorbing the energy of
that single simple musical tone only." (Emphasis
added.) This means nothing more than that the transmitter, which includes the antenna, and the receiver, which
also includes the antenna, send out and receive respectively a single period wave. It does not mean that the
antenna, in either station, was tuned, in Marconi's sense,
nor does it suggest this.
The same is true of the other passages relied upon by
the Court for suggestion. No word or hint can be found
in them that Stone intended or contemplated independently tuning the antenna. They merely suggested, on the
one hand, that when "the apparatus" at the receiving station is properly tuned to a particular transmitter, it will
receive selectively messages from the latter and, further,
that the operator may at will adjust "the apparatus at
his command" so as to communicate with any one of several sending stations; on the other hand, that "any suitable device" may be used at the transmitter "to develop
the simple harmonic force impressed upon" the antenna.
"The apparatus," as used in the statements concerning
the adjustments at the receiving station, clearly means
"the apparatus at his command," that is, the whole of that
station's equipment, which contained in the intermediate
and closed circuits, but not in the open one, the means
for making the adjustments described. There is nothing
whatever to suggest including a tuning device also in the
open circuit. The statement concerning the use of "any

MARCONI WIRELESS CO. v. U. S.

I

Rum

mn, J., dissenting.

suitable device" to "develop the simple harmonic force
impressed upon the vertical wire" might be taken, in other
context, possibly to suggest magnifying the impressed
force by inserting a device for that purpose in the open
circuit and therefore to come more closely than the other
passages to suggesting Marconi's idea. But such a construction would be wholly strained in the absence of any
other reference or suggestion in the long application to
such a purpose. Standing wholly alone as it does, it
would be going far to base anticipation of Marconi's idea
upon this language only. The more reasonable and, in
view of the total absence of suggestion elsewhere, the only
tenable view is that the language was intended to say, not
that Stone contemplated including any device for tuning
in the open circuit, but that he left to the mechanic or
builder the choice of the various devices which might be
used, according to preference, to create or "develop," in
the closed circuit, the force to be impressed upon the
antenna.
Finally, Stone was no novice. He too was "a very
expert person and one of the best men in the art." National Electric Signalling Co. v. Telefunken Wireless Tel.
Co., 209 F. 856, 864 (D. C.). He knew the difference between tuned and untuned circuits, how to describe them,
and how to apply them when he wanted to do so. He
used this knowledge when he specified including means
for tuning in his closed circuit. He did not use it to specify similarly tuning the open one. The omission, in
such circumstances, could hardly have been intentional.
In my opinion he deliberately selected an aperiodic aerial,
one to which the many receiving circuits his application
contemplated could be adjusted and one which would
carry to them, from his transmitter's tuned periodicity
and by its force alone, what it sent forward. In short,
Stone deliberately selected an untuned antenna, a tuned

closed circuit, and controlled the periodicity of both, not
by independent means in each making them mutually
and reciprocally adjustable, but by impressing upon the
untuned antenna the forced periodicity of the closed

circuit.
It may be that by his method he attained results comparable, or nearly so, to those Marconi achieved.

The

record does not show that he did so prior to his amendment. If he did, that only goes to show he accomplished in consequence what Marconi did, but by a
different method. That both had the same "broad
purpose" of providing a high degree of tuning at both
stations, and that both may have accomplished this object
substantially, does not show that they did so in the same
way or that Stone, by his different method, anticipated
Marconi.
In my opinion therefore Stone's amendment was not
supported by anything in his original application and
should not have been allowed. As petitioner says, it added
the new feature of tuning the antenna and in that respect
resembled the amendment of a Fessenden application
"to include the tuning of the closed circuit." National
Electric Signalling Co. v. Telefunken Wireless Tel. Co.,
supra. The amendment here should receive the same
fate as befell the one there involved.
Stone's letters to Baker, quoted in the Court's opinion,
show no more than his original application disclosed.
There is no hint or suggestion in them of tuning the antenna circuits "independently" as Marconi did. And the
correspondence gives further proof he contemplated introducing the inductance coil (or a device equivalent in
function) into the closed circuit, but expressed no idea
of doing the same thing in the open one.
In my opinion therefore the judgment should be reversed, in so far as it holds Marconi's broad claims invalid.
