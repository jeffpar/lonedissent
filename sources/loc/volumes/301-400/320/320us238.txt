cisions could not finally settle the questions of state law

involved, they did adjudicate the rights of the parties
with the aid of such light as was afforded by the materials
for decision at hand, and in accordance with the applicable
principles for determining state law. In this case, as in
those, it being within the jurisdiction conferred on the federal courts by Congress, we think the plaintiffs, petitioners
here, were entitled to have such an adjudication.
The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded
to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in
conformity to this opinion.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE JACKSON are of the
opinion that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals,

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THU
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 17. Argued October 12, 13, 1943.-Decided November 8, 1943.
1. Where both actual and punitive damages are recoverable under a
complaint invoking the jurisdiction of the federal district court on
the ground of diversity of citizenship, each must be considered to the
extent claimed in determining whether the jurisdictional amount is
involved. P. 240.
2. A complaint in a federal district court, invoking jurisdiction on the
ground of diversity of citizenship, alleged that the plaintiff had been
induced to purchase a certificate of insurance through fraudulent
misrepresentations by the defendants' agent as to the value, and
claimed $200,000 as actual and punitive damages. The record
showed that the plaintiff had paid $202.35 on the certificate, which
had a maximum potential value of $1,000. Held:

where the certificate was issued and mailed, or by the law of South

Opinion of the Court.

Carolina, where the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations were made,
and even though recovery of actual damages be limited to $1,000,
the plaintiff's allegations of fraud, if properly proved, might justify
an award exceeding $3,000; and therefore the requisite jurisdictional
amount was involved. Pp. 240-241.
(2) The complaint sufficiently alleged the equivalent of "gross
fraud," within the meaning of the law of Alabama, even though the
fraud was not formally alleged to be "gross." P. 241.
(3) This Court is unable to say that the Alabama law as to punitive damages precludes in this case a verdict for actual and punitive
damages exceeding $3,000. P. 242.
(4) The question of jurisdictional amount can not be determined
on the assumption that a verdict for that amount would be excessive
and could be set aside. P. 243.
3. A complaint filed in a federal court should not be dismissed for want
of jurisdiction merely because of a technical defect such as may be
the subject of a special motion to clarify. P. 242.

Messrs. R. K. Wise and Warren E. Miller for petitioner.
Mr. Richard T. Rives, with whom Mr. A. F. Whiting
was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question here is whether petitioner's complaint was
properly dismissed on the ground that the matter in controversy did not really and substantially exceed $3,000 as
required by §§ 24 and 37 of the Judicial Code."
Filed in the federal court for the Middle District of
Alabama, petitioner's complaint alleged that he had been
induced to purchase an insurance certificate through
fraudulent misrepresentations of respondents' agent bear236 Stat. 1091, 1098; U. S. C. Tit. 28, §§ 41, 80. The complaint

ing upon its actual value, and claimed $200,000 as actual
and punitive damages.! The record shows that at the
time of the dismissal petitioner had paid only $202.35 on
his certificate, and that its maximum potential value was
only $1,000. From this the District Court declared that
it was "apparent to a legal certainty," St. Paul Mercury
Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 289, that
petitioner could in no event be entitled to more than
$1,000, and therefore concluded that the requisite $3,000
was not really and substantially involved. The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed," holding that the claim of
$200,000 damages was "entirely colorable for the purpose
of conferring jurisdiction" since it was "legally inconceivable" that petitioner's allegations could justify an award
in excess of the value of his $1,000 certificate.
Where both actual and punitive damages are recoverable under a complaint each must be considered to the
extent claimed in determining jurisdictional amount.'
Therefore even though the petitioner is limited to actual
damages of $1,000, as both courts held, the question
remains whether it is apparent to a legal certainty from
the complaint that he could not recover, in addition, sufficient punitive damages to make up the requisite $3,000.
If the controlling law is that of South Carolina, where the
2The complaint further alleged official misconduct on the part of
certain officers of respondent society, and joined them as separate
defendants. Petitioner contends that these allegations with the accompanying prayers for relief are sufficient in themselves to establish that
the matter in dispute exceeds $3,000, on any of three theories: A class
action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; a derivative action against the officers for the benefit of the society; or an
original action to reorganize a mutual insurance society properly
brought by a member. As our decision indicates, we find it unnecessary to pass upon these contentions.

Opinion of the Court.

alleged fraudulent misrepresentations are said to have
occurred, petitioner clearly might recover an award exceeding $3,000.' Respondents urge however that the law
of' Alabama, where the insurance certificate was issued
and mailed, must control. We need not pass upon this
question for we are satisfied that under the law of Alabama as well as that of South Carolina petitioner's allegations of fraud if properly proved might justify an award
exceeding $3,000.
Respondents assert that petitioner's complaint does not
allege that type of "gross fraud" essential for an award
of punitive damages under Alabama law. The Supreme
Court of Alabama has declared that in an action for deceit
"gross fraud" which will support punitive damages may be
defined as "representations made with a knowledge of
their falseness (or so recklessly made as to amount to the
same thing), and with the purpose of injuring the plaintiff." Southern Building & Loan Assn. v. Dinsmore, 225
Ala. 550,552, 144 So. 21, 23. In the instant case the complaint alleges that the fraudulent representations "were
false, and were known to be false when made and uttered
with a reckless disregard for the truth"; that petitioner
"relied upon them, and had a right to rely upon them";
and that he "would not have applied for such certificate
except for such false representations." Plainly, then, this
complaint alleges the equivalent of "gross fraud" as those
words are defined by the Alabama courts
And, even if
5Respondente did not seriously contend otherwise, and the South
Carolina cases cited- to us apparently foreclosed such a contention:
Eaddy v. Greensboro-FayettevilleBus Lines, 191 S. C.538, 5 S.E.
2d 281; Cook v. MetropolitanLife Ins. Co., 186 S.C.77, 194 S.E. 636;
Crosby v. MetropolitanLife Ins. Co., 167 S. C. 255, 166 S. E. 266. In
this latter case it appears that punitive damages of $1,211.70 were
allowed although the actual damages were only $11.70.
0Had petitioner's complaint been filed in a state court in Alabama,
it would have supported a verdict and judgment for punitive damages. The Alabama Supreme Court holds that, "It is not necessary

the fraud were not formally alleged to be "gross," a complaint filed in a federal court should not be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction because of a mere technical defect
such as would make it subject to a special motion to
clarify. See Sparks Y.England, 113 F. 2d 579; cf. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Schwyhart, 227 U. S. 184,
194.
Respondents also maintain that, even if it would warrant some punitive damages, the complaint could not
under Alabama law warrant enough to support a judgment of $3,000. It is true as respondents point out that
the Alabama Supreme Court has said that the amount of
punitive damages "ought . . . to bear proportion to the

actual damages sustained," Mobile & Montgomery R. Co.
v. Ashcraft, 48 Ala. 15, 33; and that, while such damages "must rest in large measure within the discretion of
the jury," this is not an "unbridled discretion." Alabama
Water Service Co. v. Harris,221 Ala. 516, 519, 129 So. 5, 7.
But neither in these cases, nor in any others cited to us,
has that court held that punitive and actual damages must
bear a definite mathematical relationship." That there
is no such legal formula seems apparent from the rule relied upon by respondents as the correct Alabama rule
regarding the measure of punitive damages, namely, that
"The nature of the case should be considered, the character and extent of injury likely to result from disregard
to claim punitive damages specially, for they are not special damages.
It is not necessary to allege the matter of aggravation which justifies
their recovery." Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v. Murphy, 226 Ala.
226, 232, 146 So. 387.
7In U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Millonas, 206 Ala. 147, 154,
89 So. 732, the court permitted an award of $6,000 after finding that
the actual damage suffered could in no event exceed S1,000. And in
Alabama Great Southern R. Co. v. Sellers, 93 Ala. 9, 9 So. 375, where
the jury returned a verdict of $500, it was held that the trial court
did not err in refusing to charge that punitive damages could not be
imposed if the plaintiff suffered only nominal actual damage.

of duty, and all the attendant circumstances." Alabama
Water Service Co. v. Harris,supra, 519. In the Harris
case the court further emphasized the wide scope of allowable punitive damages by saying that a jury's award is
not to be disturbed if, "allowing all presumptions in favor
of" it, the court is not "clearly convinced it is so excessive
as to demand the interposition of this court." Ibid. Considering these general principles of Alabama law, we are
unable to say that-under petitioner's complaint evidence
could not be introduced at a trial justifying a jury verdict
for actual and punitive damages exceeding $3,000. Nor
can this controversy as to jurisdictional amount be decided
on the assumption "that a verdict, if rendered for that
amount, would be excessive and set aside for that reasona statement which could not, at any rate, be judicially
made before such a verdict was in fact rendered." Barry
v. Edmunds, supra, 565.
The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 18. Argued October 13, 1943.-Decided November 8, 1943.
The conciliation commissioner, making a reappraisal of the debtor's
property pursuant to § 75 (s) (3) of the Bankruptcy Act, erred
in basing the valuation partly on evidence obtained by his personal
investigation without the knowledge or consent of the parties;
but, in the circumstances of this case, the error was cured upon
review in the District Court, which reexamined all the competent
evidence introduced at the hearing before the commissioner and
thereupon modified the latter's valuation. P. 246.
131 F. 2d 222, affirmed.
