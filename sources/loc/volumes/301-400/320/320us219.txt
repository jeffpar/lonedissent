OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
Counsel for Parties.

320 U.S.

451, to issue writs of habeas corpus in aid of its appellate
jurisdiction. Cf. Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 582-3.
That jurisdiction is discretionary, id. 584; Bowen v.
Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27, and this Court does not, save
in exceptional circumstances, exercise it in cases where
an adequate remedy may be had in a lower federal court,
Ex parte Current,314 U. S. 578; Ex parte Spaulding, 317
U. S. 593; Ex parte Hawk, 318 U. S. 746, or, if the relief
sought is from the judgment of a state court, where the
petitioner has not exhausted his remedies in the state
courts, Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 115; Ex parte
Botuvineki, 314 U. S. 586; Ex parte Davis, 317 U. S. 592,
318 U. S. 412; Ex parte Williams, 317 U. S. 604. Refusal
of the writ, without more, is not an adjudication on the
merits and is to be taken as without prejudice to an application to any other court for the relief sought.

UNITED STATES EX REL. McCANN v. ADAMS,
WARDEN, ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 371.

Decided November 8, 1943.

The petition to the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus adequately raised the issue, not previously adjudicated, whether, in a
prosecution in the District Court which resulted in a judgment of
conviction, the petitioner had intelligently-with full knowledge of
his rights and capacity to understand them-waived his right to
the assistance of counsel and to trial by jury; and, in the circumstances, the petitioner was entitled to an opportunity to establish

his claim. P. 221.
136 F. 2d 680, reversed.

PLTION for a writ of certiorari to review the affirmance of an order denying an application for a writ of
habeas corpus.

Gene McCann, pro se.
