holding. Whether anchored on the east or the west side
of the channel the "Bohemian Club" would, within the
literal terms of the section, "obstruct the passage of other
vessels." The District Court found that when the fog enveloped the "Bohemian Club" for the second time, "the
least dangerous course" was to anchor on the west side of
the channel; and this finding was not disturbed by the
Circuit Court. Under a proper construction of § 15,
therefore, the circumstances which necessitated both the
first and second anchorings of the "Bohemian Club" were
equally sufficient to warrant an exception to the duty
which it requires. Whether the act of lifting anchor and
moving to the western part of the channel to avoid the
danger of the buoy constituted negligence is a question
wholly outside § 15. Since the holding of the Circuit
Court rested upon an erroneous interpretation and application of this section, its judgment must be reversed.
Reversed.

carrying on his business.1

COMMISSIONER v. HEININGER.

Opinion of the Court.

The fees and expenses were incurred under the following
circumstances. From 1926 through 1938 respondent, a
licensed dentist of Chicago, Illinois, made and sold false
teeth. During the tax years 1937 and 1938 this was his
principal business activity. His was a mail order business. His products were ordered, delivered, and paid for
by mail. Circulars and advertisements sent through the
mail proclaimed the virtues of his goods in lavish terms.
At hearings held before the Solicitor of the Post Office
Department pursuant to U. S. C., Title 39, §§ 259 and
732, respondent strongly defended the quality of his workmanship and the truthfulness of every statement made in
his advertisements, but the Postmaster General found
that some of the statements were misleading and some
claimed virtues for his goods which did not exist. Thereupon, on February 19, 1938, a fraud order was issued forbidding the Postmaster of Chicago to pay any money
orders drawn to respondent and directing that all letters
addressed to him be stamped "Fraudulent" and returned
to the senders. Such a sweeping deprivation of access to
the mails meant destruction of respondent's business. He
therefore promptly sought an injunction in a United
States District Court contending that there was no proper
evidential basis for the fraud order. On review of the
record that Court agreed with him and enjoined its enforcement. The Court of Appeals drew different inferences from the record, held that the evidence did support
the order, and remanded with instructions to dissolve the
injunction and dismiss the bill. Farley v. Heininger, 105
F. 2d 79. Respondent's petition for certiorari was denied
by this Court on October 9, 1939. Heininger v. Farley,

During the course of the litigation in the Post Office Department and the courts respondent incurred lawyer's fees
and other legal expenses in the amount of $36,600, admitted to be reasonable. In filing his tax returns for the years

1937 and 1938 he claimed these litigation expenses as
proper deductions from his gross receipts of $287,000 and
$150,000. The Commissioner denied them on the ground
that they did not constitute ordinary and necessary expenses of respondent's business. The Board of Tax Appeals 2 affirmed the Commissioner, 47 B. T. A. 95, and the
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. 133 F.
2d 567. We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict with the decisions of other circuits.$
There can be no doubt that the legal expenses of respondent were directly connected with "carrying on" his
business. Kornhauserv. UnitedStates, 276 U. S. 145, 153;
cf. Appeal of Backer, 1 B. T. A. 214; PantagesTheatre Co.
v. Welch, 71 F. 2d 68. Our enquiry therefore is limited to
the narrow issue of whether these expenses were "ordinary
and necessary" within the meaning of § 23 (a). In determining this issue we do not have the benefit of an interpretative departmental regulation defining the application
of the words "ordinary and necessary" to the particular expenses here involved. Cf. Textile Mills Securities Corp. v.
Commissioner, 314 U. S. 326, 338. Nor do we have the
benefit of the independent judgment of the Board of Tax
Appeals. It did not deny the deductions claimed by respondent upon its own interpretation of the words "ordinary and necessary" as applied to its findings of fact. Cf.
Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552, 555, 556. The interpretation it adopted was declared to be required by the Second Circuit Court's reversal of the Board's view in National

Opinion of the Court.

Outdoor Advertising Bureau v. Commissioner, 32 B. T. A.
1025.'
It is plain that respondent's legal expenses were both
"ordinary and necessary" if those words be given their
commonly accepted meaning. For respondent to employ
a lawyer to defend his business from threatened destruction was "normal"; it was the response ordinarily to be
expected. Cf. Deputy v. du Pont, 308 U. S. 488, 495;
Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S. 111, 114; Kornhauser v.
United States, supra. Since the record contains no suggestion that the defense was in bad faith or that the attorney's fees were unreasonable, the expenses incurred in
defending the business can also be assumed appropriate
and helpful, and therefore "necessary." Cf. Welch v.
Helvering,supra,113; Kornhauserv. United States, supra,
152. The government does not deny that the litigation
expenses would have been ordinary and necessary had the
proceeding failed to convince the Postmaster General that
respondent's representations were fraudulent.' Its argument is that dentists in the mail order business do not
ordinarily and necessarily attempt to sell false teeth by
v. National Outdoor Advertisement Bureau, supra, Note
3. In that case the taxpayer had incurred legal expenses defending a
suit begun by the United States to enjoin violations of the Sherman Act.
It had successfully defended part of the charges against it, but had
agreed to the entry of a consent decree of injunction as to the balance.
The Board held that all of the legal expenses were ordinary and were
proximately connected with the taxpayer's business, and that to allow
them as deductions would not be against public policy. The Circuit
Court reversed as to that portion of the expenses attributable to the
consent decree. See also Helvering v. Superior Wines & Liquors,
supra, Note 3, where the Board was reversed for allowing a taxpayer
in the liquor business to deduct lawyer's fees incurred in connection
with a compromise of liability for civil penalties assessed for improper
bookkeeping under U. S. C., Title 26, §§ 2857 et seq.

fraudulent representations as to their quality; that. respondent was found by the Postmaster General to have
attempted to sell his products in this manner; and that
therefore the litigation expenses, which he would not
have incurred but for this attempt, cannot themselves
be deemed ordinary and necessary. We think that this
reasoning, though plausible, is unsound in that it fails to
take into account the circumstances under which respondent incurred the litigation expenses. Cf. Welch v. Helvering, supra, 113, 114. Upon being served with notice
of the proposed fraud order respondent was confronted
with a new business problem which involved far more
than the right to continue using his old advertisements.
He was placed in a position in which not only his selling
methods but also the continued existence of his lawful
business were threatened with complete destruction. So
far as appears from the record respondent did not believe,
nor under our system of jurisprudence was he bound to
believe, that a fraud order destroying his business was
justified by the facts or the law. Therefore he did not
voluntarily abandon the business but defended it by all
available legal means. To say that this course of conduct
and the expenses which it involved were extraordinary or
unnecessary would be to ignore the ways of conduct and
the forms of speech prevailing in the business world. Cf.
Welch v. Helvering,supra, 115. Surely the expenses were
no less ordinary or necessary than expenses resulting from
the defense of a damage suit based on malpractice, or
fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty. Yet in these latter
cases legal expenses have been held deductible without
regard to the success of the defense.'

Opinion of the Court.

The Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Board of Tax
Appeals, and the federal courts have from time to time,
however, narrowed the generally accepted meaning of the
language used in § 23 (a) in order that tax deduction
consequences might not frustrate sharply defined national
or state policies proscribing particular types of conduct.
A review of the situations which have been held to belong
in this category would serve no useful purpose for each
case should depend upon its peculiar circumstances.! A
few examples will suffice to illustrate the principle involved. Where a taxpayer has violated a federal or a
state statute and incurred a fine or penalty he has not
been permitted a tax deduction for its payment.! Similarly, one who has incurred expenses for certain types of
lobbying and political pressure activities with a view to
influencing federal legislation has been denied a deduction.' And a taxpayer who has made payments to an
influential party precinct captain in order to obtain a
state printing contract has not been allowed to deduct

their amount from gross income.'
It has never been
thought, however, that the mere fact that an expenditure
bears a remote relation to an illegal act makes it nondeductible. The language of § 23 (a) contains no express
reference to the lawful or unlawful character of the business expenses which are declared to be deductible. And
the brief of the government in the instant case expressly
disclaims any contention that the purpose of tax laws is
to penalize illegal business by taxing gross instead of net
income. Cf. United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259.
If the respondent's litigation expenses are to be denied
deduction, it must be because allowance of the deduction
would frustrate the sharply defined policies of 39 U. S. C.
§§ 259 and 732 which authorize the Postmaster General
to issue fraud orders. The single policy of these sections
is to protect the public from fraudulent practices committed through the use of the mails. It is not their policy
to impose personal punishment on violators; such punishment is provided by separate statute," and can be imposed
only in a judicial proceeding in which the accused has the
benefit of constitutional and statutory safeguards appropriate to trial for a crime. Nor is it their policy to deter
persons accused of violating their terms from employing
counsel to assist in presenting a bona fide defense to a
proposed fraud order. It follows that to allow the deduction of respondent's litigation expenses would not frustrate the policy of these statutes; and to deny the deduction would attach a serious punitive consequence to the
Postmaster General's finding which Congress has not expressly or impliedly indicated should result from such a

finding. We hold therefore that the Board of Tax Appeals was not required to regard the administrative finding of guilt under 39 U. S. C. §§ 259 and 732 as a rigid
criterion of the deductibility of respondent's litigation
expenses.
Whether an expenditure is directly related to a business
and whether it is ordinary and necessary are doubtless
pure questions of fact in most instances. Except where
a question of law is unmistakably involved a decision of
the Board of Tax Appeals on these issues, having taken
into account the presumption supporting the Commissioner's ruling," should not be reversed by the federal
appellate courts."2 Careful adherence to this principle
will result in a more orderly and uniform system of tax
deductions in a field necessarily beset by innumerable
complexities. Cf. Hormel v. Helvering, supra. However, as we have pointed out above, the Board of Tax
Appeals here denied the claimed deduction not by an independent exercise of judgment but upon a mistaken conviction that denial was required as a matter of law. We
therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals reversing and remanding the cause to the Board
of Tax Appeals.
