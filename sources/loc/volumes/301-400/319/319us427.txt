BUCHALTER v. NEW YORK.*
CERTIORARI TO THE COUNTY COURT OF KINGS COUNTY,
NEW YORK.

No. 606. Argued May 7, 10, 1943.-Decided June 1, 1943.
1. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires
that state action be consistent with fundamental principles of liberty
and justice, but does not draw to itself the provisions of state
constitutions or state laws. P. 429.
2. Upon review here of judgments of conviction in a criminal case
in a state court, challenged by the defendants as denying their
constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, held:
(1) The record fails to establish actual bias on the part of the
jury. P. 430.
(2) The contention that the statute governing the selection of
jurors and the court's rulings on challenges worked injustice in the
impanelling of the jury raises no reviewable question of due process. P. 430.
(3) The challenged rulings upon evidence and instructions to the
jury did not deprive the defendants of a trial according to the
accepted course of legal proceedings. P. 430.
(4) The contention that the prosecuting attorney unfairly suppressed evidence is without merit. P. 431.
(5) The remarks of the prosecuting attorney to the jury, here
complained of, do not raise a due process question. P. 431.
3. Essential unfairness in a criminal trial must be shown convincingly
and not left to speculation. P. 431.
289 N. Y. 181, 45 N. E. 2d 225, affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

Mr. Solomon A. Klein, with whom Messrs. Thomas
Cradock Hughes, Henry J. Walsh, and Edward H. Levine
were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JusTicE RoBERTs

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioners were convicted of first degree murder
in the County Court of Kings County, New York, after
a trial lasting over nine weeks. The printed record consists of over twelve thousand pages. The judgments
were affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the State.' Numerous errors were there assigned. Four opinions were
written, two of which dissented from the judgments of
affirmance, as to which the court divided four to three.
In his concurring opinion the Chief Judge said that he
agreed with one of the dissenting opinions that errors and
defects occurred in the trial which could not be "disregarded without hesitation lest in our anxiety that the
guilty should not escape punishment we affirm a judgment tainted with errors obtained through violation of
fundamental rights." His conclusion was, however, that
the errors did not affect the verdict. Two dissenting
judges were of opinion that such substantial error was
committed as to require a reversal. One judge was of
opinion that the conduct of the trial was so grossly unfair as to leave the defendants without a remote chance
of free consideration of their defenses by the jury; so
unfair as to deprive them of the presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.
The remittiturs of the Court of Appeals recited that the
appellants in brief and argument raised the point that
they had been denied their constitutional rights under
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
289 N. Y. 181, 45 N. E. 2d 225, 248; rehearing denied 289 N. Y. 244,
45 N. E. 2d 425.

Opinion of the Court.

United States and that this point was considered and neces.
sarily decided. The same contention was the basis of the
petitions for certiorari.
The petitioners rely not on any one circumstance but
insist that they were not afforded a fair and impartial
jury free from influences extraneous to the proofs adduced at the trial; that they were deprived of an impartial and unbiased judge to preside at the trial and that
the prosecutor resorted to unfair methods to influence the
jury.

This court granted certiorari in order that the petitioners' claims of denial of a federal right might be examined in the light of the record with the aid of briefs
and oral argument. As the opinions rendered in the court
below state the facts and discuss the alleged trial errors
in detail we need not restate them.
The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
requires that action by a state through any of its agencies must be consistent with the fundamental principles
of liberty and justice which lie at the base of our civil
and political institutions, which not infrequently are
designated as "the law of the land."
Where this requirement has been disregarded in a criminal trial in
a state court this court has not hesitated to exercise its
jurisdiction to enforce the constitutional guarantee.8
But the Amendnment does not draw to itself the provisions
of state constitutions 'or state laws.5 It leaves the states

free to enforce their criminal laws under such statutory
provisions and common law doctrines as they deem appropriate; and does not permit a party to bring to the
test of a decision in this court every ruling made in the
course of a trial in a state court.6
The petitioners assert that, in view of unfair and lurid
newspaper publicity, it was impossible to obtain an impartial jury in the county of trial, and that the rulings
of the court denying a change of venue, and on challenges to prospective jurors, resulted-in the impanelling
of a jury affected with bias. We have examined the record and are unable, as the court below was, to conclude
that a convincing showing of actual bias on the part
of the jury which tried the defendants is established.
Though the statute governing the selection of the jurors
and the court's rulings on challenges are asserted to have
worked injustice in the impanelling of a jury, such assertion raises no due process question requiring review
by this court!
The petitioners insist that the rulings upon evidence
and instructions to the jury, when taken in their totality,
indicate that, whatever the intention of the trial judge, his
rulings and attitude precluded a fair consideration of the
case. The Court of Appeals held that certain of the
challenged rulings and instructions were erroneous but
that the errors were not substantial in the sense that they
affected the ability of the jury to render an impartial verdict, and that others of the alleged errors were not such

Opinion of the Court.

under the law of New York. As already stated, the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not enable us to review errors of state law however material under that law. We are unable to find that the rulings and
instructions under attack constituted more than errors as

to state law. We cannot say that they were such as to
deprive the petitioners of a trial according to the accepted
course of legal proceedings.
Finally, the petitioners assert that the prosecuting officer, by suppression of evidence, and by statements in his

addresses to the jury, was so unfair as to deprive the trial
of the essential quality of an impartial inquiry into their
guilt. The point as to the alleged suppression of evidence
is without merit. Certain documentary evidence was in
court. The judge ruled that the prosecuting officer need
not submit it to defense counsel for examination. If
there was error in the ruling, it was error of the court.
Upon motion for rehearing the Court of Appeals examined
the papers and found that they were not of significance in
respect of any issue in the case. No such showing of suppression of evidence or connivance at perjury, as has heretofore been held to require corrective process on the part
of.the state,8 was shown.
The speeches of counsel for defendants apparently provoked statements by the District Attorney of which petitioners now complain. This does not raise a due process
question.
As we have recently said, "it is not asking too much that
the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by
him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result
set aside, and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable realty.?
The judgments are
Affirmed.
