FREEMAN v. BEE MACHINE CO., INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.
No. 707. Argued May 4, 5, 1943.-Decided June 1, 1943.
1. A federal court having jurisdiction of a cause removed from a
state court may allow such an amendment of the complaint as
could have been made had the suit originated in the federal court,
even though the amendment could not have been made had the
suit remained in the state court. P. 451.
2. After removal to the federal District Court of an action for breach
of contract, begun in a state court against a nonresident defendant
upon whom process was personally served within the State, the
defendant entered a general appearance, defended on the merits,
and filed a counterclaim. Held that the defendant was "found"
within the district so as to give the District Court power to allow
the complaint to be amended by adding a cause of action under
§ 4 of the Clayton Act. P. 453.
3. The Rules of Civil Procedure, which permit joinder of claims,
Rule 18, and provide for amendment of pleadings, Rule 15, are
applicable to removed cases and "govern all procedure after removal," Rule 81 (c). P. 454.
4. Rule 5 of the Rules of Civil Procedure permits service of an
amended complaint to be made upon the attorney for the defendant. P. 455.

tion for a summary judgment for the defendant (petitioner here), 41 F. Supp. 461, and denied a motion of the

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
It was held in Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore &
Ohio R. Co., 258 U. S. 377, 382, that where a state court
lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties,
the federal District Court acquires none on a removal
of the case. And see General Investment Co. v. Lake
Shore & M. S. Ry. Co., 260 U. S. 261, 288; Venner v.
Michigan Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 127, 131; Minnesota
v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 389. That is true even
where the federal court would have jurisdiction if the
suit were brought there. Lambert Run Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra. As stated by Mr. Justice
Brandeis in that case, "The jurisdiction of the federal
court on removal is, in a limited sense, a derivative
jurisdiction." 258 U. S. p. 382. The question in this
case is whether the rule of those decisions is applicable
to a situation involving the following facts:
Petitioner is a resident of Ohio; respondent is a Massachusetts corporation. Respondent brought an action at
law against petitioner in the Superior Court of Massachusetts for breach of a contract. Petitioner was
personally served when he happened to be in Boston.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

Petitioner appeared specially and caused the action to be
removed to the federal District Court in Massachusetts,
petitioner being a non-resident of Massachusetts and
there being diversity of citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount. Judicial Code § 28, 28 U. S. C. § 71.
Petitioner thereupon entered a general appearance he answered, interposing several defenses including re8
judicata; he also filed a counterclaim. He then moved
for a summary judgment. Shortly before that motion
came on to be heard respondent moved to amend its declaration by adding a complaint for treble damages under
§ 4 of the Clayton Act.' 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 15.
The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment. 41 F. Supp. 461. But it denied respondent's motion to amend, being of the view that it
had no jurisdiction to allow the amendment. 42 F. Supp.
938. In reaching that result the District Court expressed
doubts that the venue requirements of § 4 of the Clayton
Act were satisfied. But it expressly declined to rest on
that basis and placed its decision solely on the Lambert
Co. line of cases. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the ruling of the District Court on the
motion for summary judgment but disagreed with its
view on the motion to amend. 131 F. 2d 190. The
case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which
we granted because of the importance of the problem and
'See Western Loan & S. Co. v. Butte & B. Mining Co., 210 U. S. 368,

2 That section provides: "Any person who shall be injured in his
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust
laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the
district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent,

without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a
reasonable attorney's fee." That section derived from § 7 of the Sher-

man Act. See Batman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co.,
273 U. S. 359, 371-374.

the contrariety of views which had developed concerning it."
The Lambert Co. case and those which preceded' and
followed it merely held that defects in the jurisdiction of
the state court either as respects the subject matter or
the parties I were not cured by removal but could thereafter be challenged in the federal court. We see no reason
in precedent or policy for extending that rule so as to bar
amendments to the, complaint, otherwise proper, merely
because they could not have been made if the action had
remained in the state court.' If the federal court has
jurisdiction of the removed cause and if the amendment
to the complaint could have been made had the suit
originated in the federal court, the fact that the federal
court acquired jurisdiction by removal does not deprive
it of power to allow the amendment. Though this suit
as instituted involved only questions of local law, it could
have been brought in the federal court by reason of diversity of citizenship." The rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,

271 U. S. 195; Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374.
6 It is clear that the Massachusetts state court did not have jurisdiction over the cause of action under the Anti-Trust laws. See 15 U. S. C.
§ 15, supra, note 2; Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252
U. S. 436, 440.
TSuits based on diversity of citizenship may be brought "only in the
district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant." Judicial Code § 51, 28 U. S. C. § 112. Congress has not made the same requirement on removal. Thus an action between citizens of different
states begun in a court of a state of which neither is a citizen may be
removed to the federal court of the district in which the suit is pending.

304 U. S. 64, is, of course, applicable to diversity causes
removed to the federal courts as well as to such actions
originating there. But if the federal court has jurisdiction
of the removed cause (Mexican National R. Co. v. Davidson, 157 U. S. 201), the action is not more closely contained
than the one which originates in the federal court. The
jurisdiction exercised on removal is original not appellate.
Virginiav. Rives, 100 U. S. 313,320. The forms and modes
of proceeding are governed by federal law. Thompson v.
Railroad Companies, 6 Wall. 134; Hurt v. Hollingsworth,

Oil & Gas Co., 274 U. S. 684; Rorick v. Devon Syndicate,
307 U. S. 299. Congress has indeed provided that in a suit
which has been removed the District Court shall "proceed
the.rein as if the suit had been originally commenced in
said district court, and the same proceedings had been
taken in such suit in said district court as shall have been
had therein in said State court prior to its removal."
Judicial Code § 38, 28 U. S. C. § 81. While that section
does not cure jurisdictional defects present in the state
court action, it preserves to the federal District Courts
the full arsenal of authority with which they have been
endowed. Included in that authority is the power to
permit a recasting of pleadings or amendments to complaints in accordance with the federal rules. West v.
Smith, supra; Twist v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., supra,
p. 687.
It is said, however, that the amendment in question
may not be made since the cause of action authorized by
§ 4 of the Clayton Act may be brought only in a District

Indeed, the de-

fendant must be a non-resident of the state in which suit is brought
before he can remove to the federal court on the ground of diversity of
citizenship. Patch v. Wabash R. Co., 207 U. S. 277..

FREEMAN v. BEE MACHINE CO.
448

Opinion of the Court.

Court in the district "in which the defendant resides or is
found or has an agent." 15 U. S. C. § 15. That requirement relates to venue. But venue involves no more and
no less than a personal privilege which "may be lost by
failure to assert it seasonably, by formal submission in a
cause, or by submission through conduct." Neirbo Co. v.
Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U. S. 165, 168. On
the face of the present record it would seem that any objection to venue has been waived. There is no indication
in the record before us that any such objection was "seasonably asserted." Commercial Ins. Co. v. Consolidated
Stone Co., 278 U. S. 177, 179; InteriorConstructionCo. v.
Gibney, 160 U. S. 217. As we have noted, the District
Court did not place its ruling on the grounds of venue.
Nor is there any indication in the record that petitioner
raised the venue point in the District Court. But even if
we assume that he did, it is not clear that the objection has
been preserved here.
But we need not rest on that narrow ground. Petitioner
was personally served in the state court action. After the
removal of the cause he entered a general appearance and
defended on the merits. He also filed a.counterclaim in
the action. He thus invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court and submitted to it. Merchants Heat & L. Co.
v. Clow & Sons, 204 U. S. 286. He was accordingly
"found" in the district so as to give the District Court
power to allow the complaint in that suit to be amended
by adding a cause of action under §4 of the Clayton Act.
This venue provision was designed, as stated by Judge
8The "only question" presented by the petition for writ of certiorari
was "whether a plaintiff may amend his complaint in a removed
action so as to state a new and independent cause of action against
the defendant which would be outside the state court's jurisdiction."
That obviously is not a presentation of a question of venue of a
federal district court under § 4 of the Clayton Act; and it can hardly
be expanded into one by an incidental discussion of venue in the
brief.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

Learned Hand in Thorburn v. Gates, 225 F. 613, 615, "to
remove the existing limitations uppn the venue of actions
between diverse citizens ' and to permit the plaintiff to sue
the defendant wherever he could catch him." But
"found" in the venue sense does not necessarily mean physical presence. We noted in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem
Shipbuilding Corp., supra, pp. 170-171, that a corporation
may be "found" in a particular district for venue purposes
merely because it had consented to be sued there. The
fact that it was present "only in a metaphorical sense"
(308 U. S. p. 170) was not deemed significant. In the
present case it is not important that at the time of this
amendment petitioner had returned to Ohio and was not
physically present in Massachusetts. He was conducting
litigation in Massachusetts. He was there for all purposes of that litigation. Having invoked the jurisdiction
of the federal court and submitted to it, he may not claim
that he was present only for the limited objectives of his
answer and counterclaim. He was present, so to speak,
for all phases of the suity That presence satisfies the
venue provision of § 4 of the Clayton Act for the purpose of
this amendment. The Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to removed cases and "govern all procedure after
removal." Rule 81 (c). They permit joinder of claims
(Rule 18) and contain the procedure for amendment of
pleadings. Rule 15. And, as we have noted, Congress
has directed the District Court after a case has been removed to "proceed therein as if the suit had been originally
commenced in said district court." Judicial Code § 38,
28 U. S. C. § 81. There can be no doubt but that the court
had the power under that statute and under the Rules to
permit the joinder of the cause of action under the Clayton Act. If petitioner was subject to the jurisdiction of
the court for purposes of the law suit, including an amendSee note 7, supra.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting:

Congress has power, of course, to authorize a suit arising under federal law to be brought in any of the federal
district courts. Robertson v. Labor Board, 268 U. S. 619,
622. But from the beginning of the federal judicial system, Congress has provided that civil suits can be brought
only in the district where the defendant is an inhabitant,
except that where federal jurisdiction is based solely upon
diversity of the parties'. citizenship, suit may be brought
in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or
the defendant. Section 51 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S.
C. § 112, derived from § 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1789,
1 Stat. 73, 79. Only in a very few classes of cases has
Congress given a strictly limited right to sue elsewhere.
Robertson v. Labor Board, supra. In § 4 of the Clayton
Act of October 15, 1914, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 15, the
legislation immediately before us, suits are authorized to
be brought "in any district court of the United States in
the district in which the defendant resides or is found or
has an agent. . . ." Similar provisions, permitting suit
where the defendant is "found," appear in the Act of
March 3, 1911, § 43, 36 Stat. 1087, 1100, 28 U. S. C. § 104
(suits for penalties and forfeitures), the Act of March 4,

immigration laws), the Act of May 27, 1933, tit. I, § 22,
48 Stat. 74, 86, 15 U. S. C. § 77v (suits under the Securities Act of 1933), and the Act of June 6, 1934, § 27, 48
Stat. 881, 902, 15 U. S. C. § 78aa, (suits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). In holding that the petitioner was "found" in the district of Massachusetts merely
because he had exercised his statutory right to remove a
suit to the federal district court in Massachusetts, the
Court, I cannot but conclude, is disregarding the venue
requirements of the Clayton Act.
The respondent, a Massachusetts corporation, brought
an action for breach of contract in the Superior Court
of Essex County, Massachusetts, against the petitioner,
a resident of Ohio, by serving him personally while at a
hotel in Boston. Since there was the requisite diversity
of citizenship and jurisdictional amount, the petitioner
appeared specially in the state court, removed the cause
to the federal district court in Massachusetts, filed an
answer and a counterclaim for damages, and moved for
summary judgment under Rule 56 (b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. Thereafter, on the day before the hearing on this motion, the respondent moved
to amend its complaint by adding a cause of action for
treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act. At that
time the petitioner was no longer present in Massachusetts. The district court granted the petitioner's motion
for summary judgment, and denied the respondent leave
to amend its complaint. The reasons for the court's action appear in its opinion:
"This court has jurisdiction under the anti-trust laws
over a nonresident only if he is found in the district or has
an agent therein. 15 U. S. C. § 15. The defendant while
in the Commonwealth was served with process in a common law action of contract. The plaintiff [respondent]
obviously seeks to take advantage of this fact in order
to obtain jurisdiction over the person in a suit involving

FREEMAN v. BEE MACHINE CO.
448

457

Fxmrnwm, J., dissenting.

a new and entirely different subject-matter, namely, the
enforcement of rights arising under federal statutes.
. . . It follows from the foregoing that if the plaintiff
is allowed to add the cause of action alleged in its motion, the amended complaint would be subject to successful attack on jurisdictional grounds. . . . The motion is, therefore, denied without prejudice to plaintiff's
right to seek redress by suit brought originally in the
Federal court." 42 F. Supp. 938, 939.
As in Camp v. Gress, 250 U. S. 308, 311, therefore, the
petitioner objected "not to the jurisdiction of a federal
court, but to the jurisdiction over him of the court of
the particular district; that is, the objection is to the venue." Such a use of the term "jurisdiction" in the sense
of venue is by no means uncommon. See, e. g., Burnrite
Coal Co. v. Riggs, 274 U. S. 208, 211-12. Although the
record contains no specific objection by the petitioner
to the amendment of the complaint by adding the cause
of action under the anti-trust laws, the opinion of the
district court recites that the parties "have now been
heard upon this [respondent's] motion" to amend the
complaint, and that the "question presented is whether
this amendment should be allowed." 42 F. Supp. at 939.
The petitioner's resistance to the entertainment by the
district court of the proposed claim under the Clayton
Act must mean that he objected to being sued in the
federal district court in Massachusetts because he was
not amenable to the process of that court; in other words,
because that court was without venue.
In vacating the judgment of the district court, the Circuit Court of Appeals stated: "The fact that in all probability the plaintiff in the case at bar could not bring a
separate action under the anti-trust laws against the defendant in the district court sitting in Massachusetts because the defendant could avoid the service of process
upon him by remaining outside of the district cannot

affect the jurisdiction of the court to allow the amendment. This is only a fact to be considered by the district
court in exercising its discretionary power to allow or disallow the amendment. Since the court below did not
exercise its discretionary power but ruled that it lacked
jurisdiction to allow the amendment we must remand to
that court for further proceedings." 131 F. 2d 190, 194-95.
The Circuit Court of Appeals plainly did not regard the
petitioner as having waived his objection to the "jurisdiction" or venue of the district court in Massachusetts.
It placed its reversal of the district court on another
ground, the correctness of which I shall consider later.
Nor can the petition for certiorari, read in its entirety,
be construed as an abandonment of the petitioner's objection to the venue of the Massachusetts district court.
True enough, the "only question presented" is stated to
be "whether a plaintiff may amend his complaint in a
removed action so as to state a new and independent cause
of action against the defendant which would be outside
the state court's jurisdiction." But the text of the petition makes it clear that the petitioner's "jurisdictional" objections included the claim that venue was not properly
laid in the Massachusetts district court. On pages 16
and 17, for example, he states:
"The question of venue or jurisdiction of the person is
not a matter lightly to be disregarded. It depends upon
substantive law. The right of a person to be sued only
in the district of which he is an inhabitant is carefully
guarded by the general venue statute, Judicial Code, section 51. .

.

. Now, being 'found' is a sporadic, temporary

thing, very different from being 'an inhabitant.' The
petitioner Freeman was 'found' at one particular time and
subjected to suit on a cause of action in contract. .

..

The original cause of action was removed to the District
Court, but this did not make Freeman 'an inhabitant' so
that he could be served at any time. The only way in

FREEMAN v. BEE MACHINE CO.
448

FR&NKrmumR, J., dissenting.

which jurisdiction can be obtained of Freeman in this district for a cause of action under the Antitrust Laws is by
having him 'found' here. This result cannot be secured
by 'amending' an existing complaint, because it would not
only violate the whole theory of venue, but it would be in
direct violation of Rule 82 [of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure], which is superior to Rule 15."
I quite agree with the Court that venue is a privilege
that may be waived, that it "may be lost by failure to
assert it seasonably." Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Corp., 308
U. S. 165, 168. But the waiver must be actual, not fictitious. There must be a surrender, not resistance. No
doubt a party who, having a valid objection to the venue
of a suit, pleads to the merits instead of making objection
waives his objection. Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, 264
U. S.375, 385; Burnrite Coal Co. v. Riggs, 274 U. S.208,
212. Here the petitioner answered the state suit before
and not after the respondent sought to amend its cornplaint'to add an exclusively federal cause of action under
the anti-trust laws. His defense to the contract claim
could not possibly waive any venue objections with respect to a claim subsequently made under the anti-trust
laws. One cannot waive an objection which he cannot
assert.
The Court relies upon Rules 15 and 18 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, which establish liberal rules for
the joinder of causes of action. But these Rules do not
dispense with the requirements of venue. Rule 82 explicitly provides that "These rules shall not be construed
to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the district courts
of the United States or the venue of actions therein."
Because causes of action could be joined, if properly
brought, does not prove that they are properly brought.
A liberal rule regarding joinder of actions does not eliminate the problems of suability created by the. various
venue provisions. The removal statute itself does not

319 U. S.

impliedly repeal the multitudinous venue restrictions imposed by Congress. And certainly Rules 15 and 18 did
not do so, especially since Rule 82 contains a specific
disavowal of such implications.
The provision of the removal statute that once a suit
is removed, the district court shall "proceed therein as if
the suit had been originally commenced in said district
court," § 38 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 81, in no
wise extends the jurisdiction or venue of the district court
after removal. The provision means only that when a
suit is removed to the federal courts, it shall be disposed
of in the manner in which business is conducted there.
The requirement of federal law that there be a unanimous
verdict of the jury, for example, applies even to suits removed from a state court where a majority of eight can
render a verdict. See Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v.
Bomboli, 241 U. S.211. Of course, therefore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are equally applicable to
suits removed to the federal courts. Rule 81 (c). But
the venue restrictions imposed by federal legislation and
left undisturbed by the Rules are not eliminated merely
because the suit is one which has been removed. The
venue of the federal court is the same, whether the suit
be originally instituted in or removed to the federal court.
It certainly is not enlarged by the fact of removal.
Joinder is permissible only if the causes of action are
properly
in court, that is, if the requirements of venue as
well as jurisdiction are satisfied. If these requirements
are not met, an order of court directing joinder cannot
dispense with them. The respondent here sought to
add a cause of action for treble damages under § 4 of the
Clayton Act-a cause of action over which the district
court in Massachusetts could have venue only if the petitioner resided in Massachusetts, or was found there either
in person or through an accredited agent. But at the
time of the proposed amendment to the complaint seek-

ing to add this claim, the petitioner was not a resident
of Massachusetts nor can he be said to have been "found"
there in any legitimate sense of the word. His only contact with Massachusetts was the fact that he was a defendant in an action for breach of contract brought in a
Massachusetts state court and properly removed to the
federal district court there. If the respondent had instituted a separate suit in Massachusetts against the petitioner under the anti-trust laws, neither the state court,
Blumenstock Bros. v. Curtis Publishing Co., 252 U. S.
436, 440, nor the federal court in Massachusetts could
entertain the suit on the ground that the petitioner was
"found" there merely because he was a defendant to the
contract suit.
I know of no case which has construed the requirement of "found," as applied to a natural person, to mean
anything less than actual physical presence. The Neirbo
case is obviously without relevance here. The problem
there was that of fitting a fictive personality into legal
categories designed for natural persons. A corporation
is never "found" anywhere except metaphorically. In
recognition of this fact the Neirbo case held that when a
corporation assents to the conditions governing the doing
of business within a state, it is as much "found" there for
purposes of federal law as for those of state law. But in
the case of a natural person, he can be "found" not metaphorically but physically. And when a person is not
actually physically present in a place, he is not, "so to
speak," "found" there except in the world of Alice in
Wonderland.
The case therefore reduces itself to this: if the petitioner had not removed the action for breach of contract
to the federal court, he could not possibly be compelled to
defend a suit under the anti-trust. laws brought against
him in Massachusetts. His mere exercise of the right of
removal given him by Congress has resulted in his being

made subject to suit in a place other than that specified
by Congress in § 4 of the Clayton Act. This is to add
to the removal privilege a condition of hardship which
Congress itself has not imposed for the simple reason that
it runs counter both to the underlying assumption of diversity jurisdiction and to the historic rule that the "jurisdiction of a district court in personam has been limited
to the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant
or in which he can be found." Robertson v. Labor Board,
268 U.S. 619, 627. The Court invokes no policy of judicial
administration which could warrant disregard of this long
established legislative policy.
The derivative nature of removal jurisdiction, see
Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 389, is not
based upon technical rules of law. Congress deemed it
fair and just that a nonresident who is being sued outside
his state should be able to transfer the suit to a neutral
federal court without losing or gaining any privileges by
such transfer. The decision in this case turns an opportunity given by Congress to assure fairness and impartiality into a Hobson's choice. By removing a suit to
the federal court a defendant is subjected to a liabilitynamely, to be sued in a district where he is neither a resident nor found, under a statute providing that he can be
sued only where he is either a resident or found-from
which he would be free if he remained in the state court.
In other words, the right of removal is curtailed by depriving a defendant of territorial immunities from suit
given by Congress in the enforcement of federal statutes,
presumably because it deemed place for suit important
in a count*r having the dimensions of a continent.
