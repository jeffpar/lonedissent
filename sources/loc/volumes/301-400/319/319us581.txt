COLE v. VIOLETTE.
Opinion of the Court.

COLE v. VIOLETTE r AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SUFFOLK COUNTY,
MASSACHUSETTS.

No. 892. Decided June 14, 1943.
1. In determining what is a final judgment or decree of a state supreme court within the meaning of § 237 of the Judicial Code, this
Court is not controlled by the designation applied to it in state
practice. P. 582.
2. A rescript from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to
the state Superior Court embodied an order directing that the final
decree of the latter court dismissing a suit on the merits be modified
by the insertion of a clause "to the effect that the bill is dismissed
on the ground that the questions raised have become moot"; and
declaring that "the decree as so modified is affirmed with costs,"
held final within the meaning of § 237 of the Judicial Code so that
an appeal applied for more than three months from the date of the
order was too late. P. 582.
312 Mass. 523, 45 N. E. 2d 400, appeal dismissed.

Mr. Harold E. Cole, pro se.
Messrs. George L. Sisson and Ray C. Westgate were on
the brief for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The question for our decision is whether the appeal was
applied for within the three months' period provided by
law. 28 U. S. C. § 350. The suit was dismissed on the
merits by the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts, which on December 4, 1942, decided that
the case had become moot. 312 Mass. 523, 45 N. E. 2d
400. On the same day, that. court sent to the Superior
Court from which the appeal was taken a rescript which
contained the following order; "Ordered, that the clerk
of said court . . .make the following entry under said
case in the docket of said court: viz., Final Decree to be
modified by the insertion of a clause to the effect that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

bill is dismissed on the ground that the questions raised
have become moot; decree as so modified is affirmed with
costs." The rescript was filed that day in the Superior
Court, which, on January 7, 1943, entered a decree as had
beeh directed.
Applications for the allowance of an appeal to this
Court, presented within three months after December 4th,
were denied by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of
Massachusetts and by an Associate Justice of this Court.
An application presented to another Associate Justice on
March 6th was allowed. But this last application was not
timely if the time to take an appeal ran from December 4th.
Matton Steamboat Co. v. Murphy, 319 U. S.412.
Massachusetts local practice regards the decree entered
by the Superior Court on the rescript, rather than the
order of the Supreme Judicial Court contained in the
rescript, as the "final decree" in the case. See Boston v.
Santosuosso,308 Mass. 189, 194, 31 N. E. 2d 564; Carilliv.
Hersey, 303 Mass. 82, 84, 20 N. E. 2d 492. But in determining what is a final judgment or decree within the meaning of § 237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 344, we
are not controlled by the designation applied to it in state
practice. Department of Banking v. Pink, 317 U. S.
264, 268; Gorman v. Washington University, 316 U. S. 98,
101. The order of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts incorporated in its rescript was an order of the
same nature and with the same incidents as those of the
highest courts of other states which we review. It was
an order of the court, and one which finally disposed of
all the issues in the case, leaving nothing to be done but the
ministerial act of entering judgment in the trial court.
The appeal is dismissed on the ground that it was not applied for within the time provided bylaw. Departmentof
Banking v. Pink, supra, and Matton Steamboat Co. v..
Murphy, supra.
Dismissed.
