JONES v. OPELIKA.
98

Syllabus.

The payments were to the customer the price of the
service. The receipts have gone, so far as here involved,
to add to the Company's surplus. They have not been
taxed as income, presumably because it has been thought
to be precluded by this Court's decisions in Edwards v.
Cuba R. Co., 268 U. S. 628, holding that under the circumstances of that case a government subsidy to induce
railroad construction was not income. But it does not
follow that the Company must be permitted to recoup
through untaxed depreciation accruals on investment it
has refused to make. The Commissioner was warranted
in adjusting the depreciation base to represent the taxpayer's net investment. Nothing in the Regulations is
to the contrary and nothing in Helvering v. American
Dental Co., 318 U. S. 322, when read in the context of
its facts touches this problem at all.
Affirmed.

The CHIEF JUSTICE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U.S.

Mr. Hayden C. Covington for petitioners.
No appearance for respondents in Nos. 280 and 314, and
appellee in No. 966.
Briefs of amici curiae were filed by Mr. Osmond K.
Fraenkel,on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union,
in support of the petition for rehearing; and by Mr. Elisha Hanson, on behalf of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, and Messrs. Homer Cummings and
Miliward C. Taft, on behalf of the General Conference of
Seventh-Day Adventists, in support of the petition for
rehearing and urging reversal.
(announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS):
The judgments in these cases were affirmed at the October Term, 1941. 316 U. S. 584. Because the issues in
all three cases were of the same character as those brought
before us in other cases by applications for certiorari at
the present term, we ordered a reargument and heard these
cases together with Murdock v. Pennsylvania,post, p. 105.
For the reasons stated in the opinion of the Court in the
Murdock case, and in the dissenting opinions filed in the
present cases after the argument last term, the Court is of
opinion that the judgment in each case should be reversed.
The judgments of this Court heretofore entered in these
cases are therefore vacated, and the judgments of the state
courts are reversed.
So ordered.
PER CURIAm
