Syllabus.

319 U. S.

Since the decision of this case the Tax Court has held in
a very similar case that where a wholly-owned subsidiary
exclusively performs services essential to the business of
the parent corporation, advances made by the parent to
meet the subsidiary's operating deficit are deductible as a
business expense. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Commissioner, No. 105730, March 25, 1943. I think this is a correct rule. Judge Harron there avoids the force of this case
only upon the ground that the parent corporation here
could not itself engage in the business done in its behalf by
the subsidiary. That distinction is good enough to get
the Tax Court away from a bad rule, but I see no reason
why such a deduction should be available in case of an
unnecessary subsidiary and be refused in the case of one
needed to comply with state laws in making a profitable
enterprise. I would reverse.

CERTIORARI, 318 U. S. 748, to review reversals of judgments of the District Court of the United States in actions

to recover moneys collected by the State of Oklahoma as
taxes.
Messrs. A. L. Herr and Clifford W. King, with whom
Mr. E. L. Mitchell was on the brief, for petitioner.

Fahy and Messrs. Felix S. Cohen and Norman A. Gray

MR. JUSTICE BLACK

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The United States brought these three actions to recover inheritance taxes imposed by the State of Oklahoma upon the transfer of the estates of three deceased
members of the Five Civilized Tribes and paid under protest by the Secretary of the Interior from funds under his
control belonging to those estates. The district court
entered judgment on the merits for the State in each case.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 131 F. 2d 635.
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the
cases in the administration of Indian affairs and to the

State of Oklahoma. The basic questions to be decided
are whether, as a matter of state law, the state taxing
statutes reach these estates, and whether Congress has
taken from the State of Oklahoma the power to levy taxes
upon the transfer of all or a part of property and funds
of these deceased Indians.
The properties of which the estates are composed fall
into four main categories: land exempt from direct taxation; land not exempt from direct taxation; restricted cash
and securities held for the Indians by the Secretary of the
Interior; and miscellaneous personal properties and insurance. The total value of the three estates was assessed
at approximately $1,245,000, of which about 90% represents the value of the cash and securities.1
Initially we are met with the contention that Oklahoma
did not intend to tax the estates of the members of the Five
Civilized Tribes. We cannot agree with this view. The
two controlling statutes broadly provide for a tax upon all
transfers made in contemplation of death or intended to
take effect after death as well as transfers "by will or the intestate laws of this state." 2 The language of the statutes
does not except either Indians or any other persons from
their scope. Efforts of Oklahoma to apply this tax to the
estate of a deceased Quapaw Indian were frustrated by
this Court's opinion in Childers v. Beaver, 270 U. S. 555,
1 The taxes assessed on this property totalled approximately $37,000.
The properties of which the estates were composed was as follows:
No. 623: Approximately 70 acres of restricted allotted land; 40
acres of land purchased from restricted funds; restricted cash and
securities. Assessed value: $250,000.
No. 624: 240 acres of restricted allotted land; personal property;
restricted cash and securities. Assessed value: $677,000.
No. 625:160 acres of allotted restricted land; 160 acres of inherited
restricted land; i four-fifths interest in 40 acres; an automobile; miscellaneous property, and insurance; restricted cash and securities.
Assessed value: $318,000.

decided in 1926. Shortly afterwards the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to sustain the tax on an Osage estate
under the impression that this result was required by the
Beaver decision; but, significantly, the Oklahoma court
held that the scope of the state law should not be limited
"further than the rule therein established." Childers v.
Pope, 119 Okla. 300, 303, 249 P. 726, 729. About 1938,
the Oklahoma taxing authorities apparently initiated new
efforts to collect an estate tax from Indians. This state action followed our decision in Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418, in which we held that the restricted
income of Indians was subject to the federal income tax,
and our decision in Helvering v. MountainProducersCorp.,
303 U. S. 376, which overruled previous decisions limiting
the power of the State to impose certain types of taxes on
incomes derived from tax-exempt and restricted Indian
property. The state tax authorities haye with reasonable
consistency interpreted their acts as covering estates such
as these, and have attempted to enforce the statutes except
when they considered enforcement precluded by decisions
of this Court. The' district court held that the state law
does apply to these estates. This interpretation is consistent with that given by the state administrative authorities, with the language of the acts themselves and with
the State Supreme Court's holding in Childers v. Pope,
supra.
The respondent's second and major contention is that
the State may not impose an estate tax upon the transfer
of the restricted cash and securities because Congress by
placing restrictions upon this property manifested a purpose to exempt it from Oklahoma estate taxes. Restricted
property of an Indian is that which may not be freely
alienated or used by the Indian without the approval of
the Secretary of the interior. We find, upon an examination of both the cases dealing generally with the taxation
of Indian property and the statute which imposes the re-

striction, that the restriction, without more, is not the
equivalent of a congressional grant of estate tax immunity
for the cash and securities.'
The many cases dealing generally with the problem of
Indian tax exemptions provide no basis for the Government's argument that Congress, in view of the existing
legal framework, must have assumed that it would immunize the securities and cash from estate taxes by
restricting their alienation. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet.
515, held that a State might not regulate the conduct of
persons in Indian territory on the theory that the Indian
tribes were separate political entities with all the rights
of independent status--a condition which has not existed
for many years in the State of Oklahoma. The same
principle was carried into the tax field in The Kansas
Indians, 5 Wall. 737, and for the same reasons. That
case also emphasized that the Indians could "not look to
Kansas for protection," 759, and that Kansas was not
"obliged to confer any rights on them," 758. The tax
exemption, said the Court, must last until the Indians
were "clothed with the rights and bound to all the duties
of citizens," 756. A similar result was reached in The
New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761, decided the same day,
where the State sought to raise money by taxes to build
roads in Indian reservations and where existing treaties
forbade the State's building such roads. Later, for a
8 It is unnecessary to consider the State's argument that Congress
is without power to exempt these estates from taxation. This issue
is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705,
since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the
exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of hn historic
policy in respect to those lands. Cf. Mcurdy v. United States, 246
U. S. 263, 269.
Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a' tax exemption once
assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that
the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed.

period of time, Indian lands held in trust by the United
States were found to be constitutionally tax-exempt on
the theory that they were federal instrumentalities, i. e.,
that the lands were held by the United States for the
Indians, and were therefore non-taxable. United States
v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432. In time, this constitutional
concept was expanded to grant tax exemption to the income derived from Indian lands, whether tribally or individually owned, even when the privilege of exploitation
had been granted to non-Indian lessees.' The instrumentality concept ultimately resulted in a decision exempting Indian estates from taxation. Childers v.
Beaver, supra. None of these cases held, nor has this
Court ever decided, that congressional restriction of an
Indian's income carried an implication of estate tax
exemption.
The underlying principles on which these decisions are
based do not fit the situation of the Oklahoma Indians.
Although there are remnants of the form of tribal sovereignty, these Indians have no effective tribal autonomy
as in Worcester v. Georgia,supra; and, unlike the Indians
involved in The Kansas Indians case, supra, they are actually citizens of the State with little to distinguish them
from all other citizens except for their limited property
restrictions and their tax exemptions Their lands are
held in fee, not in trust, as in the Rickert case, and the doctrine of constitutional immunity from taxation for the
income of their holdings on the federal instrumentality
theory has been renounced, Helvering v. Mountain Pro4 Choctaw, 0. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292; Indian Terri-

ducers Corp., 303 U. S. 376. Childers v. Beaver, supra,
was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision. The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form
of statutory implication.
The cash and securities of which these estates are almost entirely composed were restricted by the Act of January 27, 1933.6 Unless the tax immunity is granted by the
restriction clause itself, there is not a word in the Act
which even remotely suggests that Congress meant to
exempt Indians' cash and securities from Oklahoma's
estate taxes. We conclude that this Act does not exempt
the restricted property from taxation for two reasons:
(1) the legislative history of the Act refutes the contention
that an exemption was intended; and (2) application of
the normal rule against tax exemption by statutory implication prevents our reading such an implication into the
Act.
The 1933 Act was intended to serve two purposes relevant to this case. One was to continue the restrictions on
Indian property for the purpose of protecting the Indians
from loss to individuals who might take advantage of
them; and the other was to preserve the status of certain
647 Stat. 777.

where the entire interest in any tract of restricted and tax-exempt land

not longer than April 26, 1956, . .. . And provided further, That all

OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Indian land as non-taxable until 1956. See the concurring
opinion of MR.JUSTIcE RUTLEDGE in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, 719. This Act was before
two Congresses, the 71st and the 72d. It was the subject
of exhaustive debate, as well as of several committee reports, and there is no indication whatever in all that discussion of an intention to exempt Indians from estate
taxes."
The bill was sponsored by Oklahoma Congressmen who
said nothing which supports the imputation that they
intended to deprive their State of this income. It was
described by its sponsor, Congressman Hastings, as
follows:
"You ask me what the bill does. If the Members of Congress understood the bill there would not be a vote against
it. Oil has been struck underneath some of the lands allotted to the members of these tribes. Some of these fullblood allottees without business experience, now have
to their credit $100,000, $200,000 and, it is estimated, up
to $1,000,000. Suppose one of these Indian allottees died
after April 26, 1931. Then this money must be turned
over to these heirs without supervision. Do you want to
do that? Is there a man on the floor of the House who
would want to do that?" 8
7Elements of the 1933 statute were included in H. R. 15603, 71st
Congress. The bill was recommitted to the Committee on Indian Affairs for further consideration, 74 Cong. Rec. 3956-958. This discussion includes a report of the Department of the interior recommending legislation substantially similar to that finally enacted in
1933. The House later amended the provisions of its own bill into
S. 6169. 74 Cong. Ree. 7219-7222. The bill as amended was not
approved by the Senate. The plan was re-introduced in the 72d
Congress as H. R. 8750 and was discussed by the House at 75 Cong.
Rec. 8163-8170, and by the Senate at 76 Cong. Rec. 2200. This bill
was passed by the 72d Congress and became the statute under
consideration.

606

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

This purpose, and none other, is reiterated throughout
the discussion-not a word of an intention to expand tax
exemptions Was spoken by any Congressman.
The legislative history not only fails to give any affirmative support to such an implication but expressly
negatives that intent. The principal clause of the bill
dealing with taxation is that which continues a limited
land tax-exemption for twenty-five years. On two separate occasions, in two Congresses, the bill's sponsor assured the House of Representatives: "This [bill] only
applies to restricted and tax-exempt land. This does not
increase tax-exempt land at all." " Such a bill, carefully
drawn so as not to widea tax exemptions for land, and
without a word of such intent in its legislative history,
cannot be supposed by implication to have prohibited
estate taxes. If there could be any doubt of this proposition it is surely removed by a later clause of the 1933
statute which provides that all minerals extracted from
the land should be subject to state taxation. 01 Congress
could not have intended that the minerals themselves
should be subject to taxation, but that the proceeds of
their sale, even further removed from the land itself,
slould be immune.
This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are
not granted by implication. United States Trust Co.
v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57, 60. It has applied that rule
to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. As was
said. of an excise tax on tobacco produced by the Cherokee Indians in 1870, "If the exemption had been intended, it would doubtless have been expressed." Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 620. In holding the income
tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, "The terms of
the 1928 Revenue Act are very broad, and nothing there

indicates that Indians are to be excepted....

If ex-

emption exists it must derive plainly from agreements
with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with
their affairs." Superintendent Y. Commissioner, supra,
420. If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate
tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in
plain words. Such a conclusion cannot rest on dubious
inferences. "Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things," Superintendent v. Commissioner, -upra, 421, and when Congress wants to require
both nonalienability and nontaxability it can, as it has
so often done, say so explicitly.1
It is true that our interpretation of the 1933 statute must
be in accord with the generous and protective spirit which
the United States properly feels toward its Indian wards,
but we cannot assume that Congress will choose to aid the
Indians by permanently granting them immunity from
taxes which they are as able as other citizens to pay. It
runs counter to any traditional concept of the guardian and
ward relationship to suppose that a ward should be exempted from taxation by the nature of his status, and the
fact that the federal government is the guardian of its.
Indian ward is no reason, by itself, why a state should be
precluded from taxing the estate of the Indian. We have
held that the Indians, like all other citizens, must pay
federal income taxes. Superintendent v. Commissioner,
supra,421. "Wardship with limited power over his prop" See, for examples, Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567, tract made
"inalienable and nontaxable"; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861,
tract made "nontaxable and inalienable"; Act of June 30, 1902, 32
Stat. 500, tract to remain "nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any
incumbrance"; Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, "all lands upon
which restrictions are removed shall be subject to taxation, and the
other lands shall be exempt from taxation." Cf. for special treatment of the Quapaw Indians the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68.

erty" did not there "without more render [the Indian]
immune from the common burden." A federal court has
held, in a well-reasoned decision defended before us by
the Solicitor General of the United States, who is not a
party to this action, that an Indian's estate is Subject to
the federal estate tax. Landman v. Commissioner, 123
F. 2d 787.12 Congress cannot have intended to impose
federal income and inheritance taxes on the Indians and
at the same time exempt them by implication from similar
state taxes.
Congress has passed laws under which Indians have become full-fledged citizens of the State of Oklahoma.' Ok2Cert. den., 315 U. S. 810. The Department of the Interior in the
Landman case made substantially the same argument it makes here
against taxation of Indians' estates. It emphasizes that the decision.
of the Circuit Court of Appeals would lead to similar taxation by
states. The Solicitor General, opposing the Department of Interior in the Landman case, insisted that under Superintendentv. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418, and Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 691, the
Indians' estates should be subjected to taxation; and that even if the
Indians' lands were exempt from direct taxation, the estate tax should
be upheld as an excise tax, indirect in its nature, citing United States
Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115;
Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384. In other words, the Solicitor General in seeking to uphold the validity of a federal estate tax as applied
to Indian estates opposed the argument which the Department of the
Interior made then and which it makes now, the only difference being
that in the instant case the Department of the Interior is seeking to invalidate a state instead of a federal tax.

Itmust not be assumed that the Oklahoma Indians are all unable
to pay estate taxes. The estates of the three Indians here involved, as
has been noted, total well over $1,200,000. Oil and gas receipts of the
Five Civilized Tribes from 1904 to 1937 were in excess of one hundred
million dollars. Hearing on S. Res. 168, Senate Committee on Indian
Affairs, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 36. The Osages in the same period
received $261,000,000. p. 34. Annual per capita income for the
Osage Tribe as shown by a careful study made in 1928 was $19,119.

lahoma supplies for them and their children schools, roads,
courts, police protection and all the other benefits of an
ordered society. Citizens of Oklahoma must pay for these
benefits. If some pay less, others must pay more. Since
Oklahoma has become a State, it has been authoritatively
stated that tax losses resulting from tax immunity of
Indians have totalled more than $125,000,000, a sum only
slightly less than the bonded indebtedness of the State'
If Congress intended to relieve these Indians from the
burden of a state inheritance tax as a consequence of our
national policy toward Indians, there is still no reason why
we should imply that it intended the burden to be borne
so heavily by one state. But there is a complete absence
of any evidence of congressional belief that these exemptions are required on equitable grounds, no matter on
which sovereign the burden falls. Here is a tax based
solely on ability to pay.15 "Only the same duties are exacted as from our own citizens. The burden must rest

For a discussion of the respected position of Indians in Oklahoma,
see the dissenting opinion of Judge Williams, Board of Commissioners
v. Seber, 130 F. 2d 663, 681-683. The 1933 Act discussed above was

1'"The view of the survey staff is that the Indians must be educated
to pay taxes just as they must be educated to do other things. The
taxes imposed upon them must always be properly related to their
capacity to pay. For them an income tax would be infinitely better
than a general property tax because of its direct relaiionship to their
capacity to pay. The returns from such a tax would obviously be extremely small at the outset, but they would increase with the increasing
productivity of the Indians." The Problem of Indian Administration,

somewhere. Revenue is indispensable to meet the public
necessities. Is it unreasonable that this small portion of
it shall rest upon these Indians?" Cherokee Tobacco,
supra,p. 621.
Recognizing that equality of privilege and equality of
obligation should be inseparable associates, we have recently swept away many of the means of tax favoritism.
Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, permitted states to impose income taxes upon government
employees, and Helvering v. Gerhardt,304 U. S. 405, permitted the federal government to impose taxes on state
employees. O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, overruled a previous decision which held that judges should
not pay taxes just as other citizens, and Helvering v.
Mountain Producers Corp., supra, repudiated former decisions seriously limiting state and federal power to tax.
See also Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, and
Jamesv. Dravo ContractingCo., 302 U. S. 134. The trend
of these cases should not now be reversed.
What has been said requires the conclusion that the
cash and securities are not exempted by any existing legislation from state estate taxation, and this is likewise
true of the personal property in two of these estates.
The validity of the taxes on the transfer of the land
presents a somewhat different problem. Some of these
lands are exempt from direct taxation by virtue of explicit
congressional command. The Act of May 10, 1928, 45
Stat. 495, for example, provides that Indians of a class
which includes the three deceased should select up to 160
acres of his allotted, inherited or devised restricted lands,
which "shall remain exempt from taxation while the
title remains in the Indian designated . . . or in any full-

blood Indian heir or devisee," while all other restricted
lands are made subject to taxation by Oklahoma. The
State argues that congressional exemption of the land

OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. U. S.
598

Opinion of the Court.

from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from
an estate tax, because of the principles announced in
United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. A majority of the 'Court concludes that this principle does not
apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct
taxation. We therefore hold that the transfer of those
lands which Congress has exempted from direct taxation
by the State are also exempted from estate taxes.
To summarize:
In No. 623, the transfer of the cash and securities is
taxable, the transfer of the homestead and other allotted
land, exempted under the Act of May 10, 1928, is not.
The 43 acres purchased for the intestate from her restricted funds was taxable at the time of her death, Shaw
v. Gibson-ZahniserOil Corp., 276 U. S. 575, and hence is
subject to the estate tax.
In No. 624, the transfer of the cash and securities and
the personal property is taxable. The deceased died before the Act of May 10, 1928, took effect, but her 240-acre
holding was specifically exempt from direct taxation at
the time of her death under § 19 of the Act of April 26,
1906, and the transfer of lands is therefore not taxable.
In No. 625, the same result as in No. 623 follows for the
restricted lands which were appropriately selected for exemption under the Act of May 10, 1928, and for the personal property, cash, and securities. The judgment and
the insurance policy are to be treated as in a class with
the personal property, cash, and securities. It is conceded
that the 160 acres of inherited property held by the deceased was taxable at the time of his death because in
excess of the exemption permitted by the 1928 Act, and
this land is, therefore, subject to the estate tax. While
the status of the deceased's four-fifths interest in a 40-acre
tract is not clear from the record, no showing has been made
that it is not taxable.

MR. JUSTICE DouGLAs:

I concur in the result and in the disposition of the case.
While I agree that transfers of the restricted Indian lands
are not subject to Oklahoma's estate tax, I take the contrary view as respects the funds and securities covered
by the Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat. 777. In my
opinion transfers of those funds and securities are subject
to the tax for the two reasons set forth in the opinion of
the Court.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY,

dissenting in part:

I dissent because the opinion of the Court rejects a
century and a half of history. We are not here dealing
with mere property or income that is tax-exempt. This
is not the ordinary case of government and its citizens, or
a group of citizens who seek to avoid their obligations.
Our concern here is entirely different. It is with a people
who are our wards and towards whom Congress has
fashioned a policy of protection due to obligations well
known to all of us. It rests with Congress to choose when
we are done with that trusteeship. Meanwhile it is our
obligation to interpret in the light of the history of that
relationship all legislation which Congress has enacted
to carry out its Indian policy.
Normally it is true that strong considerations of fiscal
and social policy view tax exemptions with r hostile eye.
Such exemptions are not to be lightly implied, and every
reasonable implication in construing legislation is to be

made against their grant. But this general doctrine
against tax exemption is irrelevant in considering the taxing power of a state in relation to Indians. For as to them
a totally different principle comes into operation, namely,
the special status of Indians during the whole course of
our constitutional and legal history. There can be no
doubt of Congress' plenary power to exempt Indians and
their property from all forms of state taxation Such
power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or
means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at
least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from
tutelage or the final termination of the United States'
guardianship over them. Boardof Commissionersv. Seber,
318 U. S. 765; cf. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221
U. S. 286, 315-16; Braderv. James,246 U. S. 88,96; United
States v. McGowan, 302 U. S. 535, 538. See United
States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 45-47. To deny such
constitutional power is to deny the presupposition of all
legislation relating to Indians as well as an unbroken line
of decisions on Indian law in this Court and all that underlies them. This course of legislation and adjudication
may be fairly summarized as recognizing the special relation of Indians toward the United States and the exclusion
of state power with relation to them, except in so far as
the federal government has actually released to the state
governments its constitutional supremacy over this special
field. Therefore, so far as the power of a state to tax Indian property is concerned, the ordinary rule of tax exemption is reversed; a state must make an affirmative showing
of a grant by Congress of the withdrawal of the immunity
of Indian property from state taxation. This is so because it is Indian property and because Indians stand in
a special relation to the federal government from which
the states are excluded unless the Congress has manifested

a clear purpose to terminate such an immunity and allow
states to treat Indians as part of the general community.
Congress has manifested no such purpose with regard
to the estates of the deceased Indians before us. On the
contrary, those Indians were subject to federal control"
Most of their allotted lands were expressly exempt from
taxation, and, as the opinion of the Court recognizes, this
removed them from the operation of Oklahoma's estate
tax 2 But apart from these express exemptions, the bulk
of the properties in the three estates were restricted against
alienation and encumbrance by various acts of Congress.'
History, as well as statements of Congress itself,' leave no
doubt that property so restricted is beyond the taxing
power of the states, unless and until Congress gives its consent. In other words restriction is tantamount to im'The deceased Indians in these three cases were enrolled full-blood
Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes. Two were Seminoles and one was
a Creek. Congress has not terminated the guardianship relation with
respect to these tribes. They still exist (§ 28 of Act of April 26, 1906,
34 Stat. 137), and have recently been authorized to resume some of
their former powers (Act of June 26, 1936, 49 Stat. 1967). *Congress
has regarded their members of the half Indian blood or more, whether
enrolled or not, as restricted tribal Indians subject to federal control.
The fact that these Indians are citizens is not inconsistent with their
restricted status or the exercise of federal supervision over them. See
Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra; Glenn v. Lewis, 105 F. 2d 398.
2See Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567; Act of March 1, 1901, 31

1906, 34 Stat. 137; § 4 of Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.
The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate
taxes is unimportant. As pointed out before, contrary to the general
rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed. See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S.363, 366-67. For that reason decisions, such
as U. S. Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S.57, that statutory exemptions
from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have
no application here.

munity from state taxation. That was the basis of decision in Choctaw, 0. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292;
Indian Territory Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U. S. 609; Howard v. Gipsy
Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S.
549; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501. In all those
cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held
immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and
only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them
were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn
because they were the lands of Indians held in Government
tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with
the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, which overruled
Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra. Cf. the dissenting opinions
in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393. In
neither the Coronadocase nor in the Mountain Producers
case was there any contention that the land in the hands
of the lessors was subject to taxation. That was recognized and accepted as correct. The point was that even
though the land was tax immune in the hands of the lessor,
the lessor's immunity did not extend to the lessee who had
no personal immunity and who acquired the land for his
own purposes and made a profit from it. In other words,
the withdrawal of immunity from a non-Indian lessee of
restricted Indian land rests upon the remoteness of the
effect of that taxation upon such Indian property, cf.
Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, not
upon a notion that Congress did not intend by imposing
restrictions to prohibit state taxation of the interest of
Indians in their restricted property, nor upon the supposition that Congress lacks power to do so. Congress plainly
has power to implement its Indian policy by forbidding
state taxation to burden the interest of an Indian in his
property. Cf. Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276

U. S. 575; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S.
705. It exercises that power simply by imposing the
restrictions.
That Congress has considered the restriction of Indian
property against alienation and encumbrance as carrying
with it immunity from state taxation for the period of the
restriction is clear not only from statements of Congress
itself to that effect,' but also from the long history of such
restrictions and the purpose sought to be achieved, the protection of a dependent people from their own improvidence
and the exploitation of others.
Congiess early established the complete and exclusive
control of the federal government over the purchase and6
disposition of Indian lands, both tribal and individual.
The protection afforded by those and subsequent restrictive
acts and treaties extended to trespasses, transfers, tax sales,
tax liens, and other attempted interferences by the state
governments with federal control over Indian lands. See
Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515; The Kansas Indians,
5 Wall. 737; The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761.
The United States was unable, however, to prevent state
interference with the Creeks and the Seminoles in their
domains east of the Mississippi, and accordingly proposed
removal west of the Mississippi, guaranteeing that there
no State or Territory should "ever have a right to pass
laws for the government of such Indians, but they shall
be allowed to govern themselves, so far as may be compatible with the general jurisdiction which Congress may
think proper to exercise over them." Article XIV, Treaty
of March 24, 1832 (7 Stat. 366). Long after the removal
this guarantee was reaffirmed. Article IV, Treaty of August 7, 1856 (11 stat. 699). Nothing in the subsequent

treaties and allotment acts relating specifically to the
Creeks and the Seminoles was inconsistent with this guarantee of freedom from state control.! And Congress was
careful to provide that nothing in the creation of the State
of Oklahoma should qualify this promise. Thus the Oklahoma Enabling Act (34 Stat. 267) provided that the Oklahoma Constitution should not "limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make
any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands,
property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or
otherwise, which it would have been competent to make
if this Act had never been passed." The constitution
adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims
to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation
"such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United
States Government, or by Federal laws, during the force
and effect of such treaties or Federal laws" (Art. X, § 6).

As we recently said in Board of Commissioners v. Seber,
supra,Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting
Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians
through dissolution of their tribal governments and the
compulsory individualization of their lands. This allotment program evolved out of the historical background
sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and
their lands. The Indian surrendered tribal land, proT

forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and
alienation. Of. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New
York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts
he received in return land which was intended to have the
same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension. Thus the General Allotment
Act of 1887 (24 Stat. 388) provided for the issuance to
allottees of trust patents which were to declare: "the
United States does

. . .

hold the land thus allotted, for

the period of twenty-five years, in trust.., and that at the
expiration of said period the United States will convey the
same by patent to said Indian . . . in fee, discharged of

said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever." I Lands so held in trust are immune from state
taxation. United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S.432.
The lands here involved were not allotted under "trust
patents"; they were grants in fee subject to restrictions
against alienation and encumbrance.' But there are no
differences of substance between the two forms of tenure
which suggest that while the one is exempt from state
taxation, the other is not, or that Congress intended to
favor Indians holding under "trust patents" over those
holding restricted fees. Cf. The Kansas Indians,supra,at
p. 755. The power of Congress over "trust" and "restricted" lands is the same, Board of Commissioners v.
Seber, supra,and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably. See United States v. Bowling, 256 U. S.

people against loss of their property through their own
improvidence or the greed of others during the period of
transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship. To achieve this purpose the protection
afforded by Congress was not niggardly. See Tiger v.
Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; Heckman v.
United States, 224 U. S. 413; Brader v. James, 246
U. S. 88.
State taxation of "restricted" lands as well as taxation
of "trust" lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has
said shall not occur. The restrictions are not limited to
voluntary sale-consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary
as well as voluntary. Cf. Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146.
The interference of state taxation with Congress' program
of protection is made clear by the fact that the instant
Oklahoma inheritance tax acts impose liens upon the
property until the taxes are paid.o The possible consequences of a tax lien upon Indian property are pointed
out in The New York Indians, supra, where it was held
that the mere existence of a lien in a state taxing act
invalidates it, despite a provision to the effect that no
foreclosure of a lien should affect the Indian's right of
occupancy. And, even when permitting specified forms
of state taxation of restricted Indian property, Congress
has significantly provided in numerous statutes that no
tax lien should attach.1 ' I conclude that when Congress
imposed restrictions upon Indian property, it meant, and
was saying in effect, that the property was exempt from
state taxation while the restrictions continue or until

Congress waives the immunity. Indeed, Congress has
clearly stated that this was its intention by declaring in
the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68, which permitted a
gross production tax to be imposed by Oklahoma on lead
and zinc produced from restricted Quapaw lands: "In
accordance with the uniform policy of the United States
Government to hold the lands of the Quapaw Indians
while restricted and the income therefrom free from State
taxation of whatsoever nature, except as said immunity
is expressly waived, and, in pursuance of said fixed policy,
it is herein expressly provided that the waiver of tax
immunity herein provided shall be in lieu of all other
State taxes of whatsoever nature on said restricted lands
or the income therefrom,. . . .
When Congress has intended that restricted property
should be taxed, it has explicitly said so." In the absence
of such assent restricted property remains beyond the
reach of a state's taxing power. Non-alienability and tax
exemption have been said to be distinct things so far as
vested rights are concerned, see Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S.
665,673, but this of course does not mean that the concepts
of restriction and immunity from state taxation are unrelated. Nor does the circumstance that some of the apare various other expressions of Congressional understanding on this point. For example, H. Rep. No. 2415, 71st Cong., 3d
Sess., p. 1, advocating passage of what is now the Act of February
14, 1931, 46 Stat. 1108, declares: "Under existing law the restricted
allotted lands of Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes are tax exempt
while restricted." See also S. Rep. No. 982, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., pp.
3, 4, 5; S. Rep. No. 330, 65th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4.
The Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, by specifically providing in § 4 that lands from which "restrictions have been or shall
be removed shall be subject to taxation," strongly indicates a Congressional understanding that restriction amounted to tax exemption.

Seminoles, see §§ 3 and 4 of the Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and

plicable statutes expressly provide specific tax exemptions
for restricted lands indicate that restriction is not tantamount to immunity from state taxatiQn.'4 At the time the
allotments to the members of the Five Civilized Tribes
were made there was no State of Oklahoma. It had been
held that Congress had power to lay taxes upon Indian
property within Indian Territory, Cherokee Tobacco, 11
Wall. 616, and its creature, the Territorial government, was
agitating for the taxation of Indian property. 5 Restrictions, designed to protect the Indians from themselves and
the actions of third parties, including state governments,
did not bar taxation by the federal government which was
the guardian of their interests."6 Accordingly, specific tax
exemptions were written into the allotment acts." Express provisions as to the taxable status of restricted
property in the later legislation appear only where the
immunity is being limited and expressly waived in part
or the restrictions are being changed.18
All of the lands which the opinion of the Court holds
immune from Oklahoma's estate tax because of express
exemptions were therefore also exempt at the moment of
death on the additional ground that they were then subject to restrictions imposed by Congress and the concomitant tax immunity had not been waived. The other restricted lands in the estates are lands to whose taxation
Congress has specifically consented, or else were of the type

to be taxable at the time of death under the decision in
Shaw v. Gibson-ZahniserOil Corp., 276 U. S. 575.
The origin of restrictions upon the fund of members of
the Five Civilized Tribes is somewhat different from that
upon the lands, but the effect of the restrictions upon the
taxability of the cash and securities in the three estates
with which we are dealing is the same. Proceeds from
sales or leases of restricted lands have always been regarded as "trust" or "restricted" funds by the Secretary of
the Interior, who by regulations has required them to be
paid to him or his representatives and held for the benefit
of the Indian owner.1" The validity of those adrministrative restrictions and the power of the United States to enforce them have been recognized. Parker v. Richard, 250
U. S. 235; Mott v. United States, 283 U. S. 747. And it
has been held that funds so restricted by departmental
regulation are exempt from state and local taxation. See
United States v. Thurston County, 143 F. 287; United
States v. Hughes, 6 F. Supp. 972. But we do not have to
consider whether this administrative restriction alone is
sufficient to confer tax exemption upon the cash and securities in the three estates. 0
19 Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2
of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas
and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that pro-

ceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such
money be paid to a representative of the Secretary. See 25 C. F. R.
§§ 183.18, 183.20; see also § 20 of the regulations approved April 20,
1908.

In Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575, the interest
of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the

Interior with the Indian's restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian
by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the
Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax. The
opinion emphasized the difference between "a mere conveyancer's

restriction" and action by Congress.

MuRPHY, J., dissenting.

The Act of January 27, 1933 (47 Stat. 777),. imposes
Congressional restrictions by providing:
"That all funds.., now held by or which may hereafter come under the supervision of the Secretary of the
Interior, belonging to and only so long as belonging to
Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma of onehalf or more Indian blood, enrolled or unenrolled, are
hereby . . . restricted and shall remain subject to the
jurisdiction of said Secretary until April 26, 1956, ... "
This Act does not stand alone. It is part of Congress'
long continued program of protection and it carries with it
the gloss of the history of the restrictions outlined above.
Congress was not imposing restrictions for the first time,
and there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended
them to have less than their traditional historical meaning
of tax exemption in this Act. It is immaterial that the
legislative history of the Act is silent with regard to the
tax status of Indian funds. We are dealing not with a
word, nor with an act, but with a course of history. That
course makes it clear that the restricted funds in these
estates were beyond the taxing power of Oklahoma.1
It is not our function to speculate whether it is wise
at-this late day to relieve from the ordinary burden of
taxation Indians who enjoy the privileges of citizenship
and who in some instances are persons of substantial
means. Nor is it our legitimate concern that grants of
tax exemption to Indian inhabitants may create serious
fiscal problems in some states or in their local governTwo of the decedents died before the Act was passed. The House
Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds
was intended to be declaratory and retroactive. H. Rep. No. 1015,
72d Cong., 1st Sess. In view of this there is no reason why the restricted
funds in the estates of those decedents, held by the Secretary, should not
be deemed covered by that Act, and hence tax exempt by virtue of
the restrictions.
