VIRGINIAN HOTEL CORPORATION v. HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 766. Argued May 12, 13, 1942.-Decided June 7, 1943.
Under the Revenue Act of 1938, which provides that the basis on which
depreciation shall be "allowed" as a deduction in computing net income is the cost of the property with proper adjustments for depreciation to the extent "allowed (but not less than the amount
allowable)" under that and prior income tax laws, excessive amounts
claimed by the taxpayer for depreciation in his returns for earlier
years were properly deducted from cost in readjusting the depreciation basis of the property in question, although in those years no
tax benefit resulted to the taxpayer from the use of depreciation as
a deduction. P. 526.
132 F. 2d 909, affirmed.

Messrs. I. Newton Brozan and Aaron Holman filed a
brief on behalf of the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, as
amicus curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JusTIcE DouGLAs delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The facts of this case are stipulated. Petitioner operates an hotel. From 1927 through 1937 petitioner (or its
predecessor) reported in its income tax returns depreciation on certain of its assets on a straight-line basis.' No
objection was taken by the Commissioner or his agents to
the amounts claimed and deducted. In 1938 petitioner
claimed a deduction for depreciation at the same rates.
The Commissioner determined that the useful life of the
equipment was longer than petitioner claimed and that
therefore lower depreciation rates should be used.2 Accordingly a deficiency was computed. The depreciation
theretofore claimed as deductions was subtracted from
the cost of the property. The remainder was taken as the
new basis for computing depreciation. A lesser deduction for depreciation accordingly was allowed.' There
had been a net gain for some of the years in question. For
the years 1931 to 1936 inclusive there was a net loss and,
says the stipulation, "the entire amount of depreciation
deducted on the income tax returns for those years did
not serve to reduce the taxable income." Petitioner does

not challenge the new rates. It contends that the amount
of depreciation claimed for the years 1931 to 1936 inclusive
in excess of the amount properly allowable should not be
subtracted from the depreciation basis, since it did not
serve to reduce taxable income in those years. The Tax
Court, in reliance on an earlier ruling," held for the petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 132 F.

the decision below and Pittsburgh Brewing Co. v. Commissioner, 107 F. 2d 155, decided by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit.
A reasonable allowance for depreciation is one of several
items which Congress has declared shall be "allowed" as
a deduction in computing net income. Int. Rev. Code
ยง 23 (1). The basis upon which depreciation is to be "allowed" is the cost of the property with proper adjustments
for depreciation "to the extent allowed (but not less than
the amount allowable) under this Act or prior income tax
laws." ' That provision makes plain that the depreciation
basis is reduced by the amount "allowable" each year
whether or not it is claimed. Fidelity-PhiladelphiaTrust
Co. v. Commissioner, 47 F. 2d 36. Moreover the basis
must be reduced by that amount even though no tax benefit results from the use of depreciation as a deduction.
Wear and tear do not wait on net income. Nor can depreciation be accumulated and held for use in that year
in which it will bring the taxpayer the most tax benefit.

Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

Congress has elected to make the year the unit of taxation.
Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359. Thus the
amount "allowable" must be taken each year. United
States v. Ludey, 274 U. S. 295, 304.
But it is said that "allowed," unlike "allowable," connotes the receipt of a tax benefit. The argument is that
though depreciation in excess of an "allowable" amount is
claimed by the taxpayer and not disallowed by the Commissioner, it is nevertheless not "allowed" if the deductions
other than depreciation are sufficient to produce a loss for
the year in question. "Allowed" in this setting plainly has
the effect of requiring a reduction of the depreciation basis
by an amount which is in excess of depreciation properly
deductible. We do not agree, however, with the contention that such a reduction must be made only to the extent that the deduction for depreciation has resulted in a
tax benefit. The requirement that the basis should be
adjusted for depreciation "to the extent allowed (but not
less than the amount allowable)" first appeared in the
Revenue Act of 1932. 47 Stat. 169, 201. Prior to that
time the adjustment required was for the amount of depreciation "allowable." ' The purpose of the amendment
in 1932 was to make sure that taxpayers who had made
excessive deductions in one year could not reduce the depreciation basis by the lesser amount of depreciation which
was "allowable." If they could, then the government
might be barred from collecting additional taxes which
would have been payable had the lower rate been used
originally." But we find no suggestion that "allowed," as

1 S. Rep. No. 665, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29: "The Treasury has
frequently encountered cases where a taxpayer, who has taken and been
allowed depreciation deductions at a certain rate consistently over a
period of years, later finds it to his advantage to claim that the allow-

ances so made to him were excessive and that the amounts which were
in fact 'allowable' were much less. By this time the Government may

distinguished from "allowable," depreciation is confined to
those deductions which result in tax benefits. "Allowed"
connotes a grant.

Under our federal tax system there is

no machinery for formal allowances of deductions from
gross income. Deductions stand if the Commissioner takes
no steps to challenge them. Income tax returns entail
numerous deductions. If the deductions are not chal-

lenged, they certainly are "allowed," since tax liability is
then determined on. the basis of the returns. Apart from
contested cases, that is indeed the only way in which deductions are "allowed." And when all deductions are

treated alike by the taxpayer and by the Commissioner, it
is difficult to see why some items may be said to be "allowed" and others not "allowed." '
It would take clear
and compelling indications for us to conclude that "albe barred from collecting the additional taxes which would be due
for the prior years upon the strength of the taxpayer's present contentions. The Treasury is obliged to rely very largely upon the good
faith and judgment of the taxpayer in the determination of the allowances for depreciation, since these are primarily matters of judgment
and are governed by facts particularly within the knowledge of the
taxpayer, and the Treasury should not be penalized for having approved the taxpayer's deductions. While the committee does not
regard the existing law as countenancing any such inequitable results,
it believes the new bill should specifically preclude any such possibility."
8 As we have noted, the stipulation of facts states that "the entire
amount of depreciation deducted on the income tax returns" for the
years in question "did not serve to reduce the taxable income." That
has been taken to mean that no part of the depreciation deduction resulted in tax benefits. We do not stop to inquire how that could be
true when the depreciation deducted on each return from 1931 through
1936 was larger than the net loss for each of those years. If the stipulation were not accepted, one other problem would be presented. That
is the theory that when there is a loss, depreciation may be singled
out as not offsetting gross income, even though it is only one of several
deductions which is claimed. See Kennedy Laundry Co. v. Commissioner, 46 B. T. A. 70, 75, Judge Disney dissenting. In view of the
stipulation, we do not reach that question. Cf. Butler Bros. v. McColgan, 315 U. S. 501, 508--509.

lowed" as used in ยง 113 (b) (1) (B) means something
different than it does in the general setting of the revenue
acts. See Helvering v. State-PlantersBank & Trust Co.,
130 F. 2d 44.
Congress has provided for deductions of annual
amounts of depreciation which, along with salvage value,
will replace the original investment of the property at the
time of its retiremeii. United States v. Ludey, supra;
Detroit Edison Co. v. Commissioner, ante, p. 98. The
rule which has been fashioned by the court below deprives the taxpayer of no portion of that deduction. Under that rule, taxpayers often will not recover their investment tax-free. But Congress has made no such
guarantee. Nor has Congress indicated that a taxpayer
who has obtained no tax advantage from a depreciation
deduction should be allowed to take it a second time.
The policy which does not permit the second deduction
in case of "allowable" depreciation (Beckridge Corp. v.
Commissioner, 129 F. 2d 318) is equally cogent as respects depreciation which is "allowed."
Affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE, dissenting:

It is true that the 1938 Revenue Act does not speak
of a "tax benefit ' to the taxpayer. Section 23 speaks
only of deductions from gross income which "shall be allowed" in computing net income, among which it includes,
ยง 23 (1), "a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear
and tear of property used in trade or business." And by
ยง 113 (b) (1) (B) the basis for depreciation of property
is its cost adjusted by depreciation "to the extent allowed
(but not less than the amount allowable)." It is equally
true and obvious, and of some importance to the correct
interpretation of the statute, that any depreciation in
excess of the reasonable allowance authorized can, under
the statute, result in no tax advantage to the taxpayer

and in no tax prejudice to the Government, unless the excess has in fact been deducted from the taxpayer's gross
income.
I can find no warrant in the purpose or the words of
the statute, or in the principles of accounting, for our
saying that the taxpayer is required to reduce his depreciation base by any amount in excess of the depreciation
"allowable," which excess he never has in fact deducted
from gross income. Whatever else the statutory reference to depreciation "allowed" may mean, it obviously
cannot and ought not to be construed to mean that a deduction for depreciation which has never in fact been subtracted from gross income is a deduction "allowed."
And there is no reason why such should be deemed to
be its meaning. The only function of depreciation in the
income tax laws is the establishment of an amount, which
may be deducted annually from gross income, sufficient
in the aggregate to restore a wasting capital asset at the
end of its estimated life. The scheme of the 1938 Revenue Act is to prescribe the permissible deductions for
depreciation, and to preclude the taxpayer from gaining
any unwarranted advantage by the amount and distribution of those deductions. The Act accomplishes the
latter by compelling the taxpayer to reduce his depreciation base by the amount of the allowable annual depreciation, whether deducted from gross income or not, and
by such further amount as he has in fact deducted from
gross income. No reason is suggested why the taxpayer's
tax for future years should be increased by reducing his
depreciation base by any amount in excess of the depreciation "allowable," unless the excess has at some time
and in some manner been deducted from gross income.
So inequitable a result cannot rightly be achieved by saying that a "deduction" for depreciation which never has
been deducted from gross income has nevertheless been
"allowed."

What I have said does not imply that a taxpayer, who
has deducted excessive depreciation from his gross income
in any year, is not subject to a deficiency assessment as the
statutes and regulations prescribe; or that excessive deductions for depreciation taken from gross income-or
allowable depreciation, whether so deducted or not-may
not properly be used to reduce the taxpayer's depreciation
base. The statute so provides. But I do assert that,
under the system of taxation which we have established,
.the overstatement of the taxpayer's depreciation base on
which the Government insists is not to be justified because
the taxpayer may in some other year have deducted from
gross income excessive depreciation which has already
been subtracted from his depreciation base. See Burnet
v. Sanford & Brooks Co., 282 U. S. 359, 365. The statute
neither compels nor permits so incongruous a result.
The judgment should be reversed.

join in this dissent.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, dissenting:
The first and fundamental step in determining accrued
depreciation is to estimate the probable useful life of the
property to be. depreciated. This depends upon judgment and is not capable of exact determination. When
it is found, and after making allowance for probable salvage value at the time of retirement, it is a mere matter
of mathematics to compute under the straight-line method
the rate of annual accrual.
This rate when applied to the cost of the depreciable
property fixes two things: (1) The amount of the depreciation accrual to deduct from gross, before determining
net, income. For this purpose a high rate works in favor
of the taxpayer for any given year. (2) It also determines the amount by which the cost base must be reduced

for application of depreciation rates the following year.
In this aspect a high depreciation rate works in favor of
the Government.
The Virginian Hotel Corporation misconceived, as the
Commissioner thinks, the probable life of its depreciable
property. Attributing to it a longer life span, he corrected that judgment. To apply that correction consistently would lower the rate and consequent deduction
on account of depreciation and cause a smaller subtraction
from the valuation base, leaving a larger base to which
the smaller rate would be applied.
The Commissioner proposed to correct taxpayer's returns by considering only the year in question. He eliminated the error as far as it affected the rate and thus
reduced the depreciation accrual and increased the tax.
But he retained the base as reduced by the taxpayer's
accumulated errors, refusing to readjust the base consistently with the corrected depreciation rates.
To the extent that the taxpayer had obtained advantage
from the use of the higher depreciation rate, I would think
it quite justifiable to refuse to make a correction. The
Government, however, stipulates as to the years in question that "the entire amount of the depreciation deducted
on the income tax returns for those years did not serve
to reduce the taxable income." We should not disregard
a deliberately made stipulation, even if, on our limited
knowledge of its background, we are in doubt as to why
it was made. The question comes simply to this:
Whether the Commissioner, upon determining whether
taxpayer has in good faith erred, may use a correction in
so far as it helps the Government and adhere to the mistake in so far as it injures the taxpayer. I think that no
straining should be done to find a construction of the
statutes that will support the result.
I am the less inclined to lay down a rule that will permit
the Government to make inconsistent corrections in the

matter of depreciation because consistency in the matter
of depreciation is one of the few important principles of its
application. There has been no more futile tax litigation
than that over depreciation rates. In an era of rising
taxes the faster a taxpayer depleted his base for depreciation the more the Government realized in revenue from
him. If this present taxpayer had been permitted to continue its high depreciation rates, it would have come into
the present era of exceedingly high taxes with its depreciation base correspondingly exhausted. What is important
for the protection of the revenues is that accrual for depreciation be applied only to property that is properly
depreciable, that it be stopped when the property is fully
depreciated, and that the rate be consistently applied so
that the taxpayer cannot choose to take only a little depreciation when he has a little income and a lot of depreciation when he has a large income. If these conditions are observed, litigation about the rate serves chiefly
to vindicate theories rather than to protect the revenues.
If the Government desires to make revisions of theoretical rates, there is no reason why it should not observe
the rule of consistency that is one of the cardinal rules to
impose on the taxpayer. Hence, I join in the dissenting
opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE.
