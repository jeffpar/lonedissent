MOLINE PROPERTIES, INC. v. COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 660. Argued April 16, 19, 1943.-Decided June 1, 1943.
1. Upon the facts of this case, held that, for the purpose of the federal
income tax, gains from sales (in 1935 and 1936) by a corporation
of its property, although the corporation was owned wholly by an
individual stockholder, could not be treated as income taxable to
the individual rather than to the corporation. P. 440.
2. The corporation in this case was not a mere agent of the stockholder. P. 440.
131 F. 2d 388, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 318 U. S. 751, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 45 B. T. A. 647, that
there were no deficiencies in the corporate taxpayer's income and excess-profits taxes.

Mr. Nelson Trottman,with whom Messrs. Bart A. Riley
and Thomas H. Anderson were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0. Clark, Jr.,
and Mr. Sewall Key were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE

Rzm delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner seeks to have the gain on sales of its real
property treated as the gain of its sole stockholder and
its corporate existence ignored as merely fictitious. Certiorari was granted because of the volume of similar
litigation in the lower courts and because of alleged con-

flict of the decision below with other circuit court
decisions.'
Petitioner was organized by Uly 0. Thompson in 1928
to be used as a security device in connection with certain
Florida realty owned by him. The mortgagee of the property suggested the arrangement, under which Mr. Thompson conveyed the property to petitioner, which assumed
the outstanding mortgages on the property, receiving in
return all but the qualifying shares of stock, which he
in turn transferred to a voting trustee appointed by the
creditor. The stock was to be held as security for an
additional loan to Mr. Thompson to be used to pay back
taxes on the property. Thompson owned other real
property, title to which he held individually. In 1933
the loan which occasioned the creation of petitioner was
repaid and the mortgages were refinanced with a different
mortgagee; control of petitioner reverted to Mr. Thompson. The new mortgage debt was paid in 1936 by means
of a sale of a portion of the property held by petitioner.
The remaining holdings of the petitioner were sold in
three parcels, one each in 1934, 1935 and 1936, the proceeds being received by Mr. Thompson and deposited in
his bank account.
Until 1933 the business done by the corporation consisted of the assumption of a certain obligation of Thompson to the original creditor, the defense of certain condemnation proceedings and the institution of a suit to remove restrictions imposed on the property by a prior deed.

The expenses of this suit were paid by Thompson. In
1934 a portion of the property was leased for use as a
parking lot for a rental of $1,000. Petitioner has transacted no business since the sale of its last holdings in
1936 but has not been dissolved. It kept no books and
maintained no bank account during its existence and
owned no other assets than as described. The sales made
in 1934 and 1935 were reported in petitioner's income tax
returns, a small loss being reported for the earlier year
and a gain of over $5,000 being reported for 1935. Subsequently, on advice of his auditor, Thompson filed a claim
for refund on petitioner's behalf for 1935 and sought to
report the 1935 gain as his individual return. He reported the gain on the 1936 sale.
The question is whether the gain realized on the 1935
and 1936 sales shall be treated as income taxable to petitioner, as the Government urges, or as Thompson's income. The Board of Tax Appeals held for petitioner on
the ground that because of its limited purpose, the corporation "was a mere figmentary agent which should be
disregarded in the assessment of taxes." Moline Properties v. Commissioner, 45 B. T. A. 647. The Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the corporate entity, chosen by Thompson for reasons sufficient to
him, must now be recognized in the taxation of the income of the corporation. Commissionerv. Moline Properties, 131 F. 2d 388.
The doctrine of corporate entity fills a useful purpose
in business life. Whether the purpose be to gain an advantage under the law of the state of incorporation I or to

serve the creator's personal or undisclosed conveniience,5
so long as that purpose is the equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying on of business by the
corporation, the corporation remains a separate taxable
entity. New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 435,
442; Deputy v. duPont, 308 U.S. 488,494. In Burnet v.
Commonwealth Improvement Co., 287 U. S. 415, this
Court appraised the relation between a corporation and
its sole stockholder and held taxable to the corporation a
profit on a sale to its stockholder. This was because the
taxpayer had adopted the corporate form for purposes
of his own. The choice of the advantages of incorporation to do business, it was held, required the acceptance
of the tax disadvantages.
To this rule there are recognized exceptions. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, and Gulf Oil Corp.
v. Lewellyn, 248 U. S. 71, have been recognized as such
exceptions but held to lay down no rule for tax purposes.
New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, supra, 442, n. 5; Burnet v.
Commonwealth Improvement Co., supra, 419, 420. A
particular legislative purpose, such as the development
of the merchant marine, whatever the corporate device for
ownership, may call for the disregarding of the separate
entity, Munson S. S. Line v. Commissioner, 77 F. 2d 849,
as may the necessity of striking down frauds on the tax
statute, Continental Oil Co. v. Jones, 113 F. 2d 557. In
general, in matters relating to the revenue, the corporate
form may be disregarded where it is a sham or unreal.
In such situations the form is a bald and mischievous fiction. Higgins v. Smith, 308 U. S. 473, 477-78; Gregory v.
Helvering,293 U. S. 465.
The petitioner corporation was created by Thompson
for his advantage and had a special function from its in5Watson v. Commissioner, 124 F. 2d 437; Salmon v. Commissioner,

ception. At that time it was clearly not Thompson's alter
ego and his exercise of control over it was negligible. It
was then as much a separate entity as if its stock had been
transferred outright to third persons. The argument is
made by petitioner that the force of the rule requiring
its separate treatment is avoided by the fact that Thompson was coerced into creating petitioner and was completely subservient to the creditors. But this merely
serves to emphasize petitioner's separate existence. New
Colonial Co. v. Helvering, supra, 441. Business necessity,
i. e., pressure from creditors, made petitioner's creation
advantageous to Thompson.
When petitioner discharged its mortgages held by the
initial creditor and Thompson came in control in 1933,
it was not dissolved, but continued its existence, ready
again to serve his business interests. It again mortgaged
its property, discharged that new mortgage, sold portions
of its property in 1934 and 1935 and filed income tax
returns showing these transactions. In 1934 petitioner
engaged in an unambiguous business venture of its ownit leased a part of its property as a parking lot, receiving
a substantial rental. The facts, it seems to us, compel
the conclusion that the taxpayer had a tax identity distinct from its stockholder.
Petitioner advances what we think is basically the same
argument of identity in a different form. It urges that
it is a mere agent for its sole stockholder and "therefore
the same tax consequences follow as in the case of any
corporate agent or fiduciary." There was no actual contract of agency, nor the usual incidents of an.agency relationship. Surely the mere fact of the existence of a corporation with one or several stockholders, regardless of the
corporation's business activities, does not make the corporation the agent of its stockholders. Therefore the
question of agency or not depends upon the same legal
