courts below could couch their findings in different and
more words, I am by no means sure they could set
out with greater clarity their conclusion that the evidence shows both groups of bondholders to- have been
accorded fair and equitable treatment. The decision of
the Circuit Court of Appeals was made with full appreciation and after full consideration of the issues, the evidence, and the District Court's findings. Under these circumstances, I-should prefer to deny certiorari, but since the
Court has determined to grant review, I think we should not
dispose of the case without first giving the parties an opportunity to argue the issues. On the record as I now see
it, the findings were abundantly adequate, and the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.

PER CURIAM.

This case is before us on an application for the allowance
of a direct appeal as of right from a judgment of the
district court sentencing applicant to death, it being
contended that such an appeal may be taken pursuant
to the section appearing in the United States Code (1940
edition) as § 681 of Title 18. The application was presented to MR. JusTICE REED, and by him referred to
the full Court. Cf. Budlong v. Budlong, 296 U. S. 550;
Brown v. Lane, 232 U. S. 598, 600; Spies v. Illinois, 123
U. S. 131, 143; Bess v. West Virginia, 308 U. S. 509. A
similar application has been denied by the trial judge on
the ground, among others, that the section relied on to
establish the jurisdiction of this Court has been repealed.
49 F. Supp. 897.
Stephan was convicted of treason upon a jury trial and
sentenced to death. 18 U. S. C. § 2. The Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed
the conviction, 133 F. 2d 87, and after careful consideration of the case we denied certiorari. 318 U. S. 781,
rehearing denied, 319 U. S. 783. He now contends that,
in addition to the appellate review which he has already
obtained, he is entitled to an appeal as of right from
the district court directly to this Court, in view of the
provisions of 18 U. S. C. § 681, which in terms authorizes
such an appeal "in all cases of conviction of crime the
punishment of which provided by law is death, tried before any court of the United States."
This section of the Code has its origin in § 6 of the
Act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 655, 656, which granted
a writ of error as of right from this Court to any federal
trial court "in all cases of conviction of crime the punishment of which provided by law is death." This provision preceded the creation of circuit courts of appeals
by the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826. See United
States v. Rider, 163 U. S. 132, 138. Section 5 of the

Opinion of the Court.

latter Act provided that appeals be taken from district
courts (or the existing circuit courts) directly to this
Court in six specified classes of cases, one of which was
"In cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous
crime"; and by § 6 it was provided that the circuit courts
of appeals should exercise appellate jurisdiction "in all
cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law."
The Act of January 20, 1897, 29 Stat. 492, withdrew
from this Court and transferred to the circuit courts of
appeals appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases not capital.
This was accomplished by deleting, from the clause of § 5
of the Act of March 3i 1891, just quoted, the phrase "or
otherwise infamous," so that the direct appeal to this
Court was preserved only "in cases of conviction of a
capital crime."
Section 5 remained in that form until the enactment of
the Judicial Code. Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087.
Section 238 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat. 1157), which in
connection with § 236 (36 Stat. 1156) defined the jurisdiction of this Court on direct appeals from district courts,
set forth the substance of § 5 of the Act of March 3, 1891,
except that it omitted the clause providing for appeals
from the trial court to this Court "in cases of conviction of
a capital crime." This omission was not accidental, but
deliberate, and its purpose was to withdraw the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain a direct appeal from a district court in a capital case. This may be seen from the
notes of the Revisers, which state:
"The only change made in the section is in striking out the
words 'in cases of conviction of a capital crime.' The effect
of this is to take from the Supreme Court jurisdiction in
capital cases and to transfer the jurisdiction it now possesses to the circuit courts of appeals." S. Rep. No. 388,
Part 1, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 77; and also H. R. Doc. No.
783, Part 1, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 81.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

Consistently with this purpose, § 128 of the Judicial Code
provided (36 Stat. 1133) that "The circuit courts of appeals shall exercise appellate jurisdiction . .'. in all cases
other than those in which appeals and writs of error may
be taken direct to the Supreme Court, as provided in section two hundred and thirty-eight, unless otherwise provided by law." And § 297 directed (36 Stat. 1169) that
"all other Acts and parts of Acts, in so far as they are
embraced within and superseded by this Act, are hereby
repealed."
Such a plain purpose, established both by language of
the Judicial Code and its legislative history, cannot be
ignored. Our appellate jurisdiction is defined by statute
(Ex parteMcCardle, 7 Wall. 506,512; The FrancisWright,
105 U. S. 381, 386; St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Taylor,
210 U. S. 281, 292) and it is evident that since 1911 the
statutes have not authorized a direct appeal to this Court
in capital cases. The fact that the words of 18 U. S. C.
§ 681 have lingered on in the successive editions of the
United States Code is immaterial. By 1 U. S. C. § 54 (a),
the Code establishes "prima facie" the laws of the United
States. But the very meaning of "prima facie" is that the
Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at Large when the
two are inconsistent. Cf. Warnerv. Goltra,293 U. S. 155,
161; Cloverleaf Co. v. Patterson, 315 U. S. 148, 164,
n. 16.
Accordingly the application for leave to appeal is denied,
and the stay heretofore granted is vacated.
So ordered.
