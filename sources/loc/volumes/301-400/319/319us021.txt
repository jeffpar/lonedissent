No. 584. Argued April 6, 1943.-Decided May 3, 1943.
1. The Circuit Court of Appeals is empowered by § 262 of theJudicial
..Code to issue all writs, not specifically provided for by statute, which
may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, agreeably to
the usages and principles of law. P. 24.
2. As the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals is exclusively
appellate, its authority to issue writs of mandamus is restricted to
those cases in which the writ is in aid of that jurisdiction. P. 25.
3. The authority of the Circuit Court of Appeals to issue writs of
mandamus is not confined to the issuance of writs in.aid of a
jurisdiction already acquired by appeal but extends to those. cases
which are within its appellate jurisdiction aithough no appeal has
been perfected. P. 25.

4. The common law writs, like equitable remedies, may be
withheld in the sound discretion of the court. P. 25.
5. In the circumstances of this case, issuance by theCircuit Court of
Appeals of a writ of mandamus, directing the District Court to reinstate the defendants' pleas in abatement to an indictment for viola-,
tion of the Sherman Act and to set for trial the issues raised by the
pleas and replications, was inappropriate. P. 25.
The District Court's order striking the pleas in abatement was
an exercise of its jurisdiction and involved no abuse of judicial power;
the legislation and policy of Congress by which an appellate review
of such orders may be had only on review of -a final judgment. of
conviction are not to be circumvented by resort to mandamus.

review, an appellate court can not rightly exercise its discretion to

MR. CHMF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The question for decision is whether the Circuit Court of
Appeals below rightly issued its writ of mandamus to the
district court to correct that court's alleged error in
striking respondent's pleas in abatement to a criminal
indictment.
An indictment returned in June, 1941, by the grand
jury sitting in the district court for Southern California,
charged respondents and others with conspiracy to fix the
price of evaporated milk sold in interstate commerce in
violation of §§ 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C.
§§ 1, 3. The indictment recited that the grand jury which
returned it had been impaneled at the November, 1940,
term of court; that it had "begun but not finished during
said November 1940 Term of said Court, an investigation
of the matters charged in this indictment"; and that by
order of the court the grand jury had continued to sit

Opinion of the Court.

21

during the March, 1941, term "for the sole purpose of
finishing investigations begun but not completed during
said November Term."
In September, 1941, respondents filed pleas in abatement, asking that the indictment be quashed for want of
jurisdiction of the court, on averments that the minutes of
the grand jury for its meeting of February 28, 1941, disclosed that no investigation of any matter mentioned in
the indictment had been "begun" by the grand jury within
the meaning of § 284 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C.
§ 421,1 during the November, 1940, term of court, which
expired March 2, 1941.2
The Government filed replications denying generally
all the allegations of the pleas, and the issues thus raised
1That

section provides in part:
"A district judge may, upon request of the district attorney or of
the grand jury or on his own motion, by order authorize any grand
jury to continue to sit during the term succeeding the term at which
such request is made, solely to finish investigations begun but not
finished by such grand jury, but no grand jury shall be permitted to
sit in all during more than eighteen months . . ."
2 The grand jury minutes for February 28, 1941, stated:
"Special meeting of the Federal Grand Jury held this day, Foreman Mrs. Hattie H. Sloss, presiding. Minutes of previous meeting
read and approved as corrected. (See below.) Special Assistant to
the Attorney General Charles C. Pearce and Special Assistant Charles
S. Burdell continued the presentation of the peach industry for violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. There being no further business
the meeting adjourned."
Then below the following appears:
"The following industries were also named by witnesses and investigation begun.' Plywood; Wines and Grape Industry; Wholesale and
Retail Groceries; Canned and Evaporated Milk; Canned Fruit and
Vegetables; Sardine Industry; all Food Industries were suggested for
investigation, and investigation of Sugar Beet Industry was begun.
Other industries named as subject to investigation are Salmon Industry, Canned Pineapple, Walnuts and Almonds, Tomatoes, Dried fruits,
and a certain Labor Union with headquarters or located in Oakland,
Asparagus and Cherries."

were set for trial before a jury. Thereafter leave was
granted to the Government to withdraw its replications
and to file demurrers to the pleas, and motions to strike
them because insufficient in law, because they failed to
state specific facts with sufficient certainty, and because
they alleged facts which could not be within the pleaders'
knowledge. After argument the district court sustained
the demurrers and granted the motions. Respondents
thereupon instituted the present proceeding by their petition to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, praying that a writ of mandamus issue directing
petitioners--the Honorable Michael J. Roche, district
judge, and the district court-to reinstate the pleas in
abatement and the Government's replications, and to set
the issues raised by the pleas and replications for jury
trial.
On the petition for the writ and the Government's return, the court of appeals ordered the writ to issue. Upon
rehearing before the full court sitting en banc the court
held that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ; that the
district court had erred in striking the pleas in"
abatement;
that the case was an appropriate one for intervention by
mandamus; and that the writ should issue directing petitioners to reinstate the pleas in abatement and the replications, and to try the issues of fact thus raised. 130
F. 2d 843. The court'of appeals seems to have regarded
the district court's order striking the pleas in abatement
as in effect a refusal to act upon the pleas, id. 845. We
granted certiorari, 318 U. S. 747, on apetition which set
up that the circuit court of appeals erred in directing that
mandamus issue, and in holding that the district court
erred in striking the pleas in abatement.
Petitioners concede that the circuit courts of appeals,
like this Court, may, as provided by § 262 of the Judicial
Code, 28 U. S. C. § 377, "issue all writs not specifically
provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the

exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to
the usages and principles of law." McClellan v. Carland,
217 U. S. 268, 279; Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 272-3. They argue that as the district court's order striking the pleas in abatement was
an exercise of its jurisdiction, its action is reviewable only
on appeal and not by mandamus, and that since by Congressional enactment and policy appellate review of the
district court's order may be had only on review of a final
judgment of conviction, that legislation and policy are
not to be circumvented by resort to mandamus.
We are of opinion that in the circumstances of this case
these are valid objections to the exercise by the circuit
court of appeals of its discretionary power to issue the
writ.
As the jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals is exclusively appellate, its authority to issue writs of mandamus is restricted by statute to those cases in which the
writ is in aid of that jurisdiction. Its authority is not
confined to the issuance of writs in aid of a jurisdiction
already acquired by appeal but extends to those cases
which are within its appellate jurisdiction although no
appeal has been perfected. Otherwise the appellate jurisdiction could be defeated and the purpose of the statute
authorizing the writ thwarted by unauthorized action of
the district court obstructing the appeal. Ex parte

Ex parte Peru, supra, p. 584, and cases cited; Whitney v.
Dick, 202 U. S. 132, 136, 140. Hence the' question presented on this record is not whether the c6burt below had

319 U. S.

power to grant the writ but whether in the light of all the
circumstances the case was an appropriate one for the
exercise of that power. In determining what is appropriate we look to those principles which should guide judicial discretion in the use of an extraordinary remedy
rather than to formal rules rigorously controlling judicial
action. Considerations of importance to our. answer here
are that the trial court, in striking the pleas in abatement,
acted within its jurisdiction as a district court; that no
action or omission on its part has thwarted or tends to
thwart appellate review of the ruling; and that while a
function of mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction is to
remove obstacles to appeal, it may not appropriately be
used merely as a substitute for the appeal procedure prescribed by the statute.
The traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate jurisdiction both at common law and in the federal courts
has been to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise
of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its
authority when it is its duty to do so. Ex parte Peru,
supra, p. 584, and cases cited; Ex parte Newman, 14 Wall.
152, 165-6, 169; Ex parte Sawyer, 21 Wall. 235, 238; InterstateCommerce Comm'n v. United States ex rel. Campbell, 289 U. S. 385, 394. Even in such cases appellate
courts are reluctant to interfere with the decision of a
lower court on jurisdictional questions which it was competent to decide and which are reviewable in the regular course of appeal. Ex parte Harding, 219 U. S. 363,
369; cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66.
But the present case involves no question of the jurisdiction of the district court. Its jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants, and of the subject matter charged
by the indictment, is not questioned. This is not a case
like Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1, where the petitioner had
been convicted on an indictment which, because it had

ROCHE v. EVAPORATED MILK ASSN.
21

Opinion of the Court.

been amended after it was returned by the grand jury,
was thought to be "no indictment of a grand jury" Here
the indictment was returned by the requisite number of
duly qualified grand jurors, acting under order of the
court continuing the grand jury in session. The objection that the subject matter of the indictment was not
one which the jury had been or could be continued to
hear was at most an irregularity which, if the proper subject of a plea in abatement, did not affect the jurisdiction
of the court. Cf. Breese v. United States, 226 U. S. 1,
10-11; Kaizo v. Henry, 211 U. S. 146, 149; Matter of
Moran, 203 U. S. 96, 104; Harlanv. McGourin, 218 U. S.
442, 451; In re Ward, 173 U. S. 452, 454.
Nor does this case involve a refusal by the district court
to adjudicate issues properly presented to it, such as
justified the issuance of the writ in McClellan v. Carland.
supra. Compare Ex parte United States, supra. In sustaining the Government's demurrers to the pleas and its
motions to strike, the district court did not, as the court
below seemed to think, refuse to act on the pleas. Instead,
it held that they were insufficient in law to abate the
criminal prosecution. In thus ruling on questions of law
decisive of the issue presented by the pleas and replications the district court acted within its jurisdiction as a
federal court to decide issues properly brought' before it.
Its decision, even if erroneous-a question on which we do
not pass-involved no abuse of judicial power, and any
error which it may have committed is reviewable by the
circuit court of appeals upon appeal appropriately taken
from a final judgment, and by this Court by writ of
certiorari.3

of review where a statutory method of appeal has been

son of R. S. § 1011, which has been carried over in substance into
28 U. S. C. § 879. R. S. § 1011 provides:
"There shall be no reversal in the Supreme Court or in a circuit
court upon a writ of error, for error in ruling any plea in abatement,
other than a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, or for any error in
fact."
This provision was taken from § 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1
Stat. 73, 84, a section which was in terms applicable only to civil cases.
Neither the Judiciary Act of 1789 nor the Revised Statutes made any
provision for review of federal criminal cases on writ of error, although R. S. §§ 651 and 697 provided for certification to the Supreme
Court of questions arising in criminal cases. Review on writ of error
of criminal cases in the federal courts was first established by the
Act of Mar. 3, 1879, 20 Stat. 354, authorizing review of district
court decisions by circuit courts. By § 6 of the Act of February 6,
1889, 25 Stat. 655, 656, the Supreme Court was given appellate review
of capital cases on writ of error, and §§ 5 and 6 of the Judiciary Act
of 1891, 26 Stat. 826, 827-8, abolished the appellate powers of the
circuit courts, enlarged the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and authorized review of criminal cases tried in the
circuit and district courts, by the circuit courts of appeals on writ of
error.
None of these acts contains any provision making applicable to
criminal cases reviewed on writ of error the limitations which § 22
of the Judiciary Act of 1789 imposed on such review of civil cases.
Although R. S. § 1011 is phrased in terms of general applicability, it
was held in Buck Stove Co. v. Vickers, 226 U. S. 205, 213, that the rearrangement and rewording in theRevised Statutes of § 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was not intended to change the meaning of that
section, and that since § 22 had applied only to cases from federal
courts, R. S. § 10l1 did not prevent consideration of a ruling on a plea
in abatement in a case on writ of error from a state court. We think
that similar reasoning applies here to preclude the section's application
to criminal cases, to which in its original form it did not apply.
In a large number of criminal cases, this Court and the circuit courts
of appeals have reviewed on the merits decisions overruling or refusing
to entertain pleas in abatement, although without reference to R. S

Lowdon v. United States, 149 F. 673. A few circuit courts of appeals
have said that the section prevented appellate consideration of a
decision overruling a plea in abatement to an indictment, although also
holding that the pleas were properly overruled. Mounday v. United
States, 225 F. 965, 967 (C.C. A. 8); Luxenberg v. United States,
45 F. 2d 497, 498 (C. C.A. 4); Biemer v. United States, 54 F. 2d 1045
(C. C. A. 7) ; Unitcd States v. Molasky, 118 F. 2d 128, 133 (C.C.A.
7). And the section has on occasion been cited as precluding appellate review of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence in criminal
cases--a proposition which hardly needs its support. Miles v. United
States, 103 U. S. 304, 313; e. g. Jaramillo v. United States, 76 F. 2d
700; Rosenberg v. United States, 15 F. 2d 179, 181; Jezewski v. United
States, 13 F. 2d 599, 602; Stoecko v. United States, 1 F. 2d 612, 613;
Kinser v. United States, 231 F. 856, 861. The fact that the great
majority of appellate decisions, including all in this Court, have considered pleas in abatement on the merits, establishes a practice,
beginning soon after the first authorization of criminal appellate review,
which is persuasive of the statutory intent. •
Our conclusion that R. S. § 1011 is inapplicable to criminal cases
is reinforced by a consideration of the kinds of objections which in a
criminal case may properly be the subjects of a plea in abatement.
Although frequently described as a dilatory plea which should be
strictly construed, United States v. Greene, 113 F. 683, 688-9, such a
plea is an appropriate means of raising objections to an indictment
which may involve serious and prejudicial infringements of procedural
rights, such as an objection to the qualifications of grand jurors, Crowley v. United States, supra (compare the Act of April 30, 1934, 48
Stat. 648, 649, 18 U. S. C. 554a); to the method of selection of the
grand jury, Agnew v. United States, supra (cf. Glasser v. United
States, 315 U. S.60, 85); or to its composition, see Carter v. Texas,

diction to review only final decisions of 'district courts,
28 U. S. C. § 225 (a).' Respondents stress the inconvenience of requiring them to undergo a trial in advance of
an appellate determination of the challenge now made to
the validity of the indictment. We may assume, as they
allege, that that trial may be of several months' duration
and may be correspondingly costly and inconvenient.
But that inconvenience is one which we must take it Congress contemplated in providing that only final judgments
should be reviewable. Where the appeal statutes establish the conditions of appellate review, an appellate court
cannot rightly exercise its discretion to issue a writ whose
only effect would be to avoid those conditions and thwart
the Congressional policy against piecemeal appeals in
criminal cases. Cobbledick v. UnitedStates, 309 U. S. 323.
As was pointed out by Chief Justice Marshall, to grant the
writ in such a case would be a "plain evasion" of the Congressional enactment that only final judgments be brought
up .for appellate review. "The effect therefore of this
mode of interposition would be to retard decisions upon
questions which were not final in the court below, so that
the same cause might come before this Court many times
before there could be a final judgment." Bank of Columbia v. Sweeney, 1 Pet. 567, 569. See also Life & Fire
Insurance Co. v. Adams, 9 Pet. 573, 602; Ex parte Hoard,
105 U. S. 578,579-80; American ConstructionCo. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. Ry. Co., 148 U. S. 372, 379.
For that reason this Court has consistently refused to
sustain the use of mandamus as a means of reviewing
the action of a district court in denying a motion to remand a cause to the state court from which it had been
removed. Ex parte Hoard, supra; Ex parte Harding,
' By the Act of May 9, 1942, Pub. L. No. 543, 77th Cong., 2d Sess.,
the Government is given a right of appeal from a decision or judgment
sustaining a plea in abatement to an indictment or information or any
count thereof.

supra; Ex parte Roe, supra; Ex parte Park Square Automobile Station, supra." And for the same reason it has
held in other cases that the writ will not issue to
review an order overruling a plea to the jurisdiction, In
re Atlantic City R. Co., supra;Ex parte Chicago, R. I. &
P. Ry. Co., 255 U. S. 273, 280; cf. In re New York & Porto
Rico S. S. Co., 155 U. S. 523, 531, or denying a nonsuit,
Ex parte Loring, 94 U. S. 418, despite the inconvenience
to petitioner of being forced to proceed to trial in advance
of a review of the court's action. Ex parte Whitney, 13
Pet. 404, 408; Ex parte Perry, 102 U. S. 183, 186. Here
the inconvenience to the litigants results alone from the
circumstance that Congress has provided for review of
the district court's order only on review of the final judgment, and not from an abuse of judicial power, or refusal
to exercise it, which it is the function of mandamus to
correct. Hence there are in this case no special circumstances which would justify the issuance of the writ, such
as the persistent disregard of the Rules of Civil Procedure
prescribed by this Court, found in McCullough v. Cosgrave, 309 U. S. 634 (see Los Angeles Brush Co. v. James,
272 U. S. 701, 706-8); or the refusal to perform a plain
ministerial duty, involved in Ex parte United States,
supra; or the considerations of comity between state and
federal courts, thought to be controlling in Maryland v.
Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9, 29.
5

Mandamus has frequently been used to compel the remand to a
state court of a criminal case improperly removed under §§ 31-33 of
the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. §§ 74-6. Maryland v. Soper (No. 1),
270 U. S. 9, and cases cited; Colorado v. Symes, 286 U. S. 510. But
removal of such cases involves an extraordinary interference with a
state's administration of criminal justice such as to justify an exceptional use of the writ. Moreover, in those cases there was no
provision for appeal by the state from an acquittal, Maryland v. Soper,
supra, 30; cf. United States v. anges, 144 U. S. 310. And see Kepner
v. United States, 195 U. S. 100, with which compare Palko v. Connecti-

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

319 U. S.

The decisions of this Court on which respondents especially rely are not applicable here. In Ex parteSimons,
247 U. S. 231, the writ directed the district court to set
aside its order transferring to the equity docket a case
plainly triable at law by jury. The district court's order
was regarded by this Court "as having repudiated jurisdiction" of the suit. In Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300,
in which the writ was sought similarly to compel the district court to set aside its order referring the cause to an
auditor, the application was denied because the order was
held not to preclude a jury trial. And in Ex parteSkinner
& Eddy, 265 U. S. 86, the writ prohibited the Court of
Claims from exercising jurisdiction, contrary to statute,
o:ver a suit which it had previously dismissed. There its
assumption of jurisdiction would have deprived the litigants of trial by jury in a state court where an action
against an agency of the United States involving the same
issue was pending. Thus in the two cases in which the
writ was granted, it was issued in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to compel an inferior court to relinquish a jurisdiction which it could not lawfully exercise or to exercise a jurisdiction which it had unlawfully
repudiated. Cf. Ex parte Peru, supra. In the present
case the district court has acted within its jurisdiction and
has rendered a decision which, even if erroneous, involved
no abuse of judicial power. Ifn issuing the writ the court
of appeals below has done no more than substitute mandamus for an appeal contrary to the statutes and the policy
of Congress, which has restricted that court's appellate
review to final judgments of the district court.
