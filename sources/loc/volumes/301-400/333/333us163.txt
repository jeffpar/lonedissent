CONSTRUCTION CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 214.

Argued December 18, 1947.-Decided March 8, 1948.

A resident and citizen of Mississippi brought an action based on
diversity of citizenship in the Federal District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana against a partnership and its individual members who were residents of the Western District of Louisiana and
a Texas corporation which had qualified to do business in Louisiana
and made itself amenable to suit in the federal courts for either
the Eastern or Western District of that State. Held: The venue
was improper as to the partnership and its individual members
and the suit was properly dismisged as to them, since none of the
parties was a resident of the Eastern District of Louisiana within
the meaning of §§ 51 and 52 of the Judicial.Code. Pp. 164-169.
(a) The "residence" of a corporation, within the meaning of
the venue statutes, is only in the state and district in which it
was incorporated. Pp. 166-168.
(b) While, concededly, the Texas corporation had made itself
amenable to suit in the federal courts of either district in Louisiana
by qualifying to do business in that State, such action on the part
of the corporation did not constitute a waiver by the partnership
and its individual members of the privileges conferred upon them
by the venue statutes. P. 168.
161 F. 2d 289, affirmed.

The District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana
dismissed as to respondents (residents of the Western
District), on the ground of improper venue, a suit brought
against them and a foreign corporation by a resident of

Mississippi. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON delivered the opinion of

the Court.
We granted certiorari in this case to consider a question
arising under the federal venue statutes. Petitioner, a
resident and citizen of the State of Mississippi, brought
a negligence action based on diversity of citizenship in
the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
The defendants in that suit were the respondents Reich
Bros. Construction Company, a partnership, and its individual members, residents of the Western District of
Louisiana, and Highway Insurance Underwriters, a Texas
corporation which had qualified to do business in Louisiana pursuant to a statute of that State.
Section 51 of the Judicial Code provides that ".
where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that
the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall
be brought only in the district of the residence of either

the district where he resides; but if there are two or more defendants,
residing in different districts of the State, it may be brought in
either district, and a duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the marshal of any other district in which any
defendant resides. The clerk issuing the duplicate writ shall endorse

Opinion of the Court.

It is conceded by the parties that the Texas corporation,
Highway Insurance, having qualified to do business in
Louisiana is amenable to suit in the federal courts for
either the Eastern or Western District of that State.'
The critical issue of the case is whether Highway Insurance may be regarded as a "resident" of the Eastern
District of Louisiana within the meaning of § 52 of the
Judicial Code, so that respondents Reich Bros. Construction Company and its individual members may properly
be sued as co-defendants of the corporation in the Eastern
District of Louisiana, despite the fact that respondents
are residents of the Western District of that State.
The respondents moved to dismiss the action on the
ground of improper venue. The District Court granted
the motion, and the suit was dismissed as to respondents,
leaving the action pending against the corporation. The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.'
The issue we are called upon to resolve is a narrow
one. We are not confronted with the abstract question
whether, under any circumstances or for any purposes,
a foreign corporation may properly be regarded as acquiring "residence" in a State other than that in which
it was incorporated. Nor is our problem that of discovering whether, under state law, a qualified foreign
corporation is treated as a "resident" of the State in
thereon that it is a true copy of a writ sued out of the court of the
proper district; and such original and duplicate writs, when executed
and. returned into the office from which they issue, shall constitute
and be proceeded on as one suit; and upon any judgment or decree
rendered therein, execution may be issued, directed to the marshal
of any district in the same State."

which it is doing business.' The sole issue of this case
relates to the construction of the term "residence," appearing in the particular federal venue statutes under
consideration, as it applies to a foreign corporation.
The "residence" of a corporation, within the meaning
of these statutes has frequently been the subject of consideration by this Court for a period of over half a century. Shortly after Congress had enacted § 51 of the
Judicial Code in substantially its present form, this Court
declared that the "residence" of a corporation, within the
meaning of the venue statutes, is only in "the State and
district in which it has been incorporated." " Thus, in
Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U. S. 444, 450 (1892),

it was said: "This statement has been often reaffirmed
by this court, with some change of phrase, but always
retaining the idea that the legal existence, the home, the
domicil, the habitat, the residence, the citizenship of
the corporation can only be in the State by which it was
created, although it may do business in other States whose
laws permit it."
For almost sixty years, in an unbroken line of decisions,
this Court has applied the same construction.! That view

was reaffirmed as recently as 1946 in the opinion of the
Court in Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326
U. S. 438, 441.8
Congress has revealed a similar understanding of the
term "residence" when enacting special venue statutes in
situations in which it was intended that, at the election
of the plaintiff, a corporation should become amenable
to suit either in the State of incorporation or in States
in which it is carrying on corporate activities. In those
statutes, Congress has provided that the venue of such
suits should be located not. only in the district in which
the corporation is a "resident" or an "inhabitant," but
also in districts in which it may be "found," "transacts
business," or has an agent to receive service of process.'
Nor does the decision of this Court in Neirbo Co. v.
Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U. S. 165 (1939), require that the term "residence" be construed differently.
In that case, the plaintiffs, citizens and residents of New
Jersey, brought suit based on diversity of citizenship
against the defendant, a Delaware corporation, in the
Southern District of New York. This Court held that the
venue requirements in the federal courts may be waived
and that the defendant, since it had appointed an agent
-to receive service of process in New York pursuant to
8 Section 52 of the Judicial Code qualifies or provides an exception
to the general provisions of § 51. There would be no basis for the
suggestion that Congress intended to attribute a meaning to the
term "residence" in § 51 different from that in § 52.
1 See, e. g., § 12 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 736, 15 U. S. C. § 22:
"Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a
corporation may be brought not only in the judicial. district whereof
it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found
or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served
in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be
found." See also § 48 of the Judicial Code, 29 Stat. 695, 28 U. S. C.
§ 109; § 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 'Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. 1§15; 36
Stat. 291, 45 U. S. G.456.

a statute of that State, might not insist upon suit being brought in Delaware, the State of its incorporation,
or in New Jersey, the State in which plaintiffs resided.
But this Court did not hold that in losing the privilege
of insisting upon suit in districts specified in § 51 of the
Judicial Code, the defendant corporation thereby acquired "residence" in New York, within the meaning of
the venue statutes. Indeed, the Court specifically stated
that the suit "was not brought 'in the district of the residence of either the.plaintiff or the defendant.' "10
For the reasons stated, we hold that the Highway Insurance Underwriters, a Texas corporation and respondents' co-defendant, is not a resident of the Eastern District of Louisiana in which suit was brought, Within the
meaning of § 52 of the Judicial Code. While, concededly,
the Texas corporation has made itself amenable to suit in
the federal courts of either district in Louisiana by qualifying to do business in that State, such .action on the
part of the corporation may in no way be regarded as a
waiver by respondents of the privileges conferred upon
them by the venue statutes. Section 51 in general terms
provides that a diversity suit of the sort involved here
must be brought either in the district in which the plaintiff resides or in which the defendant resides. This suit,
brought in the Eastern District of Louisiana, satisfies
neither requirement. Respondents' privilege conferred
by § 51 can be defeated either by waiver on the part
of respondents or, as provided in § 52, by petitioner
bringing suit against respondents and others in a district in Louisiana in which one of the co-defendants
has acquired residence but in which respondents do not
reside. Neither circumstance is present here. Respondents made timely assertion of their privilege and

may not be deemed to have waived their venue objections. As we have held, their co-defendant, Highway Insurance Underwriters, may not be regarded as a resident
of the Eastern District of Louisiana in which suit was
brought. It follows, therefore, that respondents' objections to venue were well taken, and that, in sustaining
those objections, the District Court and the Circuit Court
of Appeals reached a result in accord with the requirements of the federal venue statutes as consistently construed by this Court. If those requirements are to be
altered, it is a task which must be undertaken by
Congress.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 223.

Argued February 3-4, 148.-Decided 'March 8, 1948.

1. The Interstate Commerce Commission has power under the Interstate Commerce Act to order a railroad to make deliveries of
interstate carload shipments of livestock without discrimination
to a.shipper on the shipper's private sidetrack, even though compliance with that order will require the railroad to use an intermediate segment of track maintained and operated by the railroad
but owned by and leased from a competing shipper. whose lease
to the railroad precludes use of such track for the purpose of
making .such deliveries to its competitors. Pp. 175-178.

(a) The definitions contained in §§ 1 (1) (a) and 1 (3) (a) of
the Interstate Commerce Act make all trackage "in use by any
common carrier" subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act,
even though not. owned by the carrier but only used by it under
a lease. P. 176.
(b) The command of Congress against discrimination cannot
be subordinated to the command of a track owner that a railroad
using the-track practice discrimination. P. 177.
