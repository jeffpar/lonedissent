PARKER v. ILLINOIS.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 270.

Argued February 13, 1948.-Decided April 5, 1948.

.petitioner was sentenced by an Illinois court to 90 days in jail for
contempt. .The State Supreme Court denied a direct review. The
trial court then issued an amended order adjudging petitioner guilty
of contempt and sentencing 1bim to jail for 90 days. Petitioner
appealed from this order to an intermediate state court, which
sustained it on state grounds. The State Supreme Court affirmed.
Neither the intermediate court nor the State Supreme Court considered petitioner's claimed denial of rights under the Federal
Constitution. Under Illinois practice, a case involving a claim of
federal right must be taken directly from the trial court to the
State Supreme Court, else the federal question is deemed waived.
Held.:
1. In 'appealing the amended order to the intermediate state
court rather than directly to the State Supreme Court, petitioner
waived his claim of rights under the Federal Constitution. Central
Union Co. v. Edwardsville, 269 U. S.190. Pp. 572-576.
2. When federal rights are involved, it is for this Court to determine whether a claimaut's failure to follow the procedure designed
by a State for their protection constitutes a waiver of them. P. 574.
3. The Illinois practice of requiring constitutional questions to
be taken directly to the State Supreme Court, and refusing to
review them if review is first sought in an intermediate state court,
affords litigants a reasonable opportunity to have constitutional
questions heard and determined by the state court, and is valid.
Pp. 574-575.
4. The fact that a petition to the State Supreme Court for review
of the amended order may have seemed futile, in view of that
court's denial of direct review of the original order, does not excuse
petitioner's failure to proceed in the prescribed manner. Pp. 575576.
5. If the petition to this Court for certiorari be considered as
involving only the original order, it is out of time; if it involves
the amended order, it presents federal questions which have beeii
waived. .Pp. 575-576.

6. The result in this case is no different if the original and
amended orders are regarded as the same in substance though
separate in point of time and form, since it is not unreasonable
for Illinois to reftde a second appeal. P. 576.
396 III. 583, 72 N. E. d 848, affirmed.

The State Supreme Court denied direct review of an
order of a trial court sentencing petitioner to imprisonment for contempt. An amended order of the trial court
was affirmed by an appellate court, 328 Ill. App. 46, and
by the State Supreme Court, 396 Ill. 583, 72 N. E. 2d
848. This Court granted certiorari. 332 U. S. 846.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner, who was engaged in litigation in the Illinois
courts with one Shamberg, was ordered on a motion for
discovery to produce certain documents. He produced
them by filing then with the clerk of the Illinois courts.
Shamberg thereupon moved that petitioner be punished
for contempt because the documents reflected on the integrity of the court. After a hearing petitioner was
adjudged guilty of contempt. The court held ,that the
order required only that petitioner produce the documents, not that he file them in court so as to make them
public records; and that the filing of the documents
containing statements deemed to be scurrilous constituted
an obstruction of justice and an abuse of the processes
of the court, tending to lessen the court's dignity and

authority.! Petitioner was sentenced to jail for 90*days.
That was on January 15, 1945. Petitioner thereupon
sought a writ of error in the Illinois Supreme Court for
review of the order of January 15. The writ of error was
refused on January 23, 1945. Later in the same day the
trial court, over petitioner's objection and in his presence,
issued an amended order adjudging him guilty of contempt and sentencing him to jail for 90 days. This
amendment was made, it is said, to cure certain defects in
the order of January 15 and to bring it into conformity
with the requirements of Illinois law.
The amended order of January 23 is the one before us.
Petitioner did not seek to take it directly to the Illinois
Supreme Court. Rather, he took it first to the Appellate
Court of Illinois where he sought to attack it on the
grounds, inter alia, that it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. But the
Illinois Appellate Court did not consider those constitutional questions. It sustained the amended order of
January 23 on state grounds. 328 Ill. App. 46, 65 N. E.
2d 457. On writ of error the Illinois Supreme Court
affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Court. 396 Ill.
583, 72 N. E. 2d 848. It likewise did not consider the
constitutional questions which petitioner presented. For
it is well-settled law in Illinois that if an appellant takes
his case to-the Appellate Court where errors are assigned
of which that court has jurisdiction, he is deemed to have
waived any constitutional questions. People v. Rosenthal, 370 Ill. 244, 247, 18 N. E. 2d 450, 452; People v.
McDonnell, 377 Ill. 568, 569, 37 N. E. 2d 159, 160. That

federal constitutional questions tendered by petitioner.
See 328 Ill. App. 46, 55, 65 N. E. 2d 457, 461; 396 Ill.
583, 587, 72 N. E. 2d 848, 850-851. The circumstance
that the petitioner had taken the order of January 15
directly to the Illinois Supreme Court did not cause that
Court to except this case from that well-settled rule of
Illinois practice.
This Court held in Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville,
269 U. S.190, that federal constitutional questions which
Illinois held had been waived for failure to follow its procedure would not be entertained here. The nature of the
questions presented in the present case seemed to us to
warrant a grant of the petition for writ of certiorari to
determine whether the rule of the Edwardsville case was
applicable to the peculiar circumstances presented here.
When federal rights are involved, it is, of course, for
this Court finally to determine whether the failure to
follow the procedure designed by a State for their protection constitutes a waiver of them. Davis v. O'Hara,266
U. S. 314; Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville, supra.
The Court said in the Edwardsville case that when the
waiver is founded on a failure to comply with the appellate practice of a State, the question turns on whether
that practice gives litigants "a reasonable opportunity to
have the issue as to the claimed right heard and determined" by the state court. 269 U. S., pp. 194-195. It
was there held that the Illinois practice of requiring constitutional questions to be taken directly to the Illinois
Constitutional questions are to be reviewed directly by the Illinois Supreme Court. - Ill. Rev. Stat. c. 110, ยง 199 (1947). As held
in this case those include questions arising under the Federal Constitution. And see Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville, 269 U. S.

cases. People v. Terrill, 362 Ill.

Opinion of the Court.

Supreme Court and of refusing to review them if review

was first sought in the Appellate Court satisfied the requirement. We adhere to that decision. The channel
through which the constitutional questions, raised by
petitioner in his attack on the amended order, could have
been taken all the way to this Court was not only clearly
marked, it was also open and unobstructed.
Petitioner appears here pro se. But at the critical
stages of this litigation he was represented by counsel of
record. For the lawyer the choice was plain. Under
these circumstances petitioner plainly had a reasonable
opportunity to have his federal questions passed upon
by the state court. When petitioner acting through counsel decided to seek review in the Appellate Court he made
a choice which involved abandonment of the constitutional issues which he had raised in the proceedings.
There is a suggestion that petitioner deemed it useless
to try to take the amended order of January 23 to the
Illinois Supreme Court since access to that court had been
denied him when review of the order of January 15 was
sought. But even though the attempt may have seemed
futile,3 it was only by first seeking review in the Illinois
Supreme Court that he could bring to this Court the constitutional questions raised under the amended order of
January 23. It is not an answer to say that he went to the
Illinois Supreme Court for review of the order of January
15. That is not the order under which he stands committed; it is not the order reviewed by the Illinois Supreme Court in this case. Nor could denial, by the Illinois
Supreme Court of his petition for a review of that earlier
Cf. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Burnham, 162 U. S. 339.
4The writ of error by which petitioner challenged the order of
January 15 does not appear in the present record. We assume most
favorably to petitioner that the same constitutional questions were
presented there as petitioner seeks to have adjudicated here.

order have been the foundation for this petition for certiorari. Review of that order was denied by the Illinois
Supreme Court on January 23, 1945. Petition for certiorari was filed here August 15, 1947. His petition for
certiorari is not timely if it challenges the earlier order.'
It presents federal questions which have been waived if
it involves, as it plainly does, the amended order.
The result is no different if the orders are treated as
being the same in substance though separate in point of
time and form. For if the January 15 order be regarded
as merely an interlocutory version of the amended order
of January 23, the fact remains that the latter order was
not taken directly to the Illinois Supreme Court but to the
Illinois Appellate Court, with the consequences we have
indicated. We find it no more unreasonable for Illinois
to require a second appeal than for this Court to do so,
as it does when it refuses to review the judgment of a
lower state court absent a second appeal to the highest
court of the State, though that be a mere formality because governed by the law of the case established in an
earlier appeal. McComb v. Commissioners of Knox
County, 91 U. S. 1; Great Western Telegraph Co. v.
Burnham, 162 U. S.339.
It is suggested that in this case there could be no final
judgment within the meaning of ยง 237 of the Judicial
Code, 28 U. S. C. ยง 344, which could be brought here by
certiorari until all questions of state law had been resolved by the Illinois courts. But there would be nothing other than ministerial acts left to be done by the trial
court once the Illinois Supreme Court denied direct review of the order. Cf. Richfield Oil Corp. v.State Board,
329 U. S. P9, 72-73. *Any further proceedings in the

Illinois courts would be solely at the option of petitioner.
In these crcumstances, a judgment is no less final for
purposes of our jurisdictional statute because it-has been
sustained solely on federal constitutional grounds.' That
consequence is inherent in the rule formulated in Central

Petitioner has been held in contempt and sentenced
to imprisonment for complying with an order of court
to produce specified documents. Technically he was cr
dered to show cause why the documents should not be
produced. After his objections to that order were over
ruled he complied by bringing the documents into court
and filing them with the clerk.' Thereupon he was cited

If direct review of the amended order were obtained in the Illinois

Supreme Court, rather than denied for lack of a substantial constitutional question, that court would pass not only upon the constitu-

tional questions but upon all other questions as well. Groome v.
Freyn Engineering Co., 374 Ill.
113, 28 N. E. 2d 274; People v. Kelly,
367 Ill. 616, 618, 12 N. E. 2d 612, 613; Geiger v. Merle, 360 Ill. 497,
505, 507, 196 N. E. 497, 500-501.
1 At this time petitioner was'not represented by counsel and there
was a slight deviation from a strictly accurate compliance with the
court's directive. But even if he had had counsel, the deviation was
minuscule. It could not have furnished a sufficient basis, without
more, for sustaining an order of contempt and commitment as for
disobedience. The court's order indeed did not rest on any such
ground. It rested rather on the grounds that the "filing of said scurrilous affidavit and exhibits . . . constitutes an obstruction of justice
and an abuse of the [court's] processes . . and tended to lessen .. .
[its] dignity and authority .... ." Obviously the mere filing of
documents not scurrilous could have given no ground for entering or

sustaining such an order. Cf. note 3.

for contempt because the documents reflected on the
court's integrity and was sentenced to 90 days in jail.
Whether or not the documents would have given ground
for punishment if. they, had been published voluntarily
by'petitioner,. the effect of the contempt judgment coupled with that of the order for production3 has been
first to compel petitioner to publish the statements by
filing them and then to send him to jail for obeying the
court's order. Cf. Entick v. Carrington,19 How. St. Tr.
1029, 1073. I know of no constitutional power which
permits a state to force a citizen into such a dilemma,
and I think the most elementary conception of due process
under the Fourteenth Amendment forbids any such
action.
Yet this Court now acquiesces in this substantial and
unconstitutional deprivation of petitioner's liberty by
accepting an asserted procedural waiver of petitioner's
substantive' rights which, in my opinion, no more comports with basic conceptions of due process than does
the substantive order for commitment. Constitutional
rights may be nullified quite as readily and completely
b~y hypertechnical procedural obstructions to their effective assertion and maintenance as by outright substantive
denial.. Marino v. Ragen, 332 U. S. 561, concurring
opinion at 563.

U. S. 331; Bridges v. California,314 U. S. 252.

The state makes a weak effort to avoid the order's effect by
attempting to distinguish between an order to show cause why the
,documents should not be produced and one for their production'
We have been cited to no authority holding that in Illinois.the order
to show cause does not have the effect of an order' for prodiction if
cause is not shown or, in that eve-ft, would not support an order of
cote4ppt for failing to produce.

RUTLEDGE,

J., dissenting.

The entire basis of the Court's action is that the original
contempt order of January 15 and the so-called amended
order of January 23 are different orders; petitioner is
deemed to have waived his constitutional rights by taking
an appeal from the latter order to the Illinois Appellate
Court rather than to the Illinois Supreme Court. The
case seems simple because it is said to be "well-settled
Illinois law" that both federal and state constitutional
rights are waived by taking this appellate route, and
because this Court has previously determined that this
appellate practice gives litigants a reasonable opportunity
to be heard. See Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville,
269 U. S. 190, 194-195.
I cannot accept this hypertechnical procedural nullification of constitutional rights in a case involving the
liberty of the individual. The original order of January
15 and the so-called amended order are in reality the
same order. Moreover, prior to this case there was no
"well-settled Illinois law" to apprise petitioner that his
appeal to the intermediate court would constitute a
waiver of his rights in circumstances such as these, where
he had already sought review of his federal questions in
the state supreme court. And finally, even if the contrary had been true, I would not consider this appellate
practice reasonable within the doctrine of 'he Central
Union case.
Petitioner filed the "scurrilous affidavits" which led to
the contempt order on two different occasions. The first
was on January 4 in response to the motion to produce
them for inspection. The second was on January 15 as
part of his answer to Shamberg's motion for a rule to
show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt
for filing documents which he was only required to produce for inspection. On this second occasion the documents were included in the pleadings because relevant

to his defense that the statements made therein were
true.' The court *adjudged petitioner in contempt for
both filings.'
In the original contempt order of January 15 the
court specifically referred to the fact that the docuinents had been filed twice before, identified them care-

fully, and stated that they "should be by reference incorporated in this order and made a part hereof for
Petitioner never obtained a hearing on the truth of the statements in the documents even though that issue was relevant to the
merits of the slander action against Shamberg which gave rise to
the contempt proceedings. Since this slander action was dismissed
on the merits without trial, it is of interest that the Illinois Appellate
Court pointed out in review of the contempt order discussed in note 5
infra: "When Shamberg's petition is considered in the light of the
fact that Parker had demanded a jury trial in the slander case, it
seems reasonably clear that the trial court should not have ruled
Parker to answer the petition, as the evident purpose of that pleading
was to have the trial court prejudge facts that Parker insisted should
be submitted to a jury." 428 Ill. App. 46, 63.
"On January 23 the court also issued an additional contempt order
based on the tone of petitioner's answer to still another motion filed
by Shamberg asking that petitioner be placed in contempt for not
producing all of the-documents listed in the motion to produce. This
contempt order was set aside by the Illinois Appellate Court. See
note 4 supra. Among other things that court' stated: "[Shamberg's]
petition is a'highly provocative pleading, and Shamberg probably intended that it should have that effect. There is some force in the
contention of,Parker that the petition was designed to provoke him
into making some answer or statement that would subject him to
criminal prosecution or contempt proceedings. There is also force
in Parker's argument that if the statements he made in his answer,
upon which Shamberg ilow relies, constitute contempt of court, why
did not the many charges made against Parker in the petition also
constitute contempt of court'? .. . We think that when the stateinents made by Parker in his answer are considered in the light of
the serious charges that were made against Parker and the Puritan
Church in the petition; the answer seems to be a fairly temperate
pleading." 328 Ill. App. 46, 67-68.

greater certainty." At a later point in the order the
documents were again listed and adjudged to be "hereby
incorporated by reference in this order and made a part
hereof with the same force and effect as if set forth
herein." Thus the documents which gave rise to the
contempt order were twice made a matter of public record and twice incorporated in the original contempt
order.
The so-called amended order of January 23 is absolutely
identical with the original order with the immaterial exception that the documents, in addition to being incorporated in the order by reference were also "made a part
hereof and marked Exhibits 'A' and 'B' respectively."
The reason for the change is probably explained by Illinois cases such as People v. Hogan, 256 Ill. 496, holding
that the record on review of a contempt order is limited to
the order itself. But respondent has not called our attention to any Illinois cases holding that incorporation of
matter of public record into an order by .reference is insufficient to make that matter part of the order. Indeed,
this very proceeding indicates that this requirement is not
strictly applied. For the Illinois Appellate Court set
aside one order adjudging petitioner in contempt for the
tone of his answer to a certain pleading filed by Shamberg on the ground that the charges in Shamberg's pleading, which was not made a part of the contempt order,
justified the tone of the answer. 328 Ill. App. 46, 60-68.
But even if it is assumed that the amendment was necessary to satisfy the requirements of Illinois law, it was
of such a trivial and ministerial nature that it obviously
did not affect the merits of petitioner's constitutional
allegations.
When petitioner sought review of the original contempt
order in the Supreme Court of Illinois he obtained the
only review of those constitutional contentions which

333 U. S.

the state procedure offered him. That court by denying
the writ of error must be presumed to have passed on the
merits of the constitutional questions in the case. It is
inconceivable that the supreme court would have passed
on them any differently if review of the so-called amended
order had later been requested. For, as far as that
court is concerned, it is likely that the law of the case
as to the constitutional issues was already settled. But
even if it were taken that the supreme court might
have reversed its decision, the fact remains that the socalled amended order was the same order as the original
January 15 order of which review had already been
denied. Petitioner is deemed to have waived his federal
constitutional rights not because he failed to seek review
in the supreme court, but because he failed to do so
twice.
It is definitely not "well-settled Illinois law" that a
waiver results in these circumstances. In all of the cases
cited in the opinion of the Court and in respondent's
brief the petitioner initially sought review in the intermediate appellate court. In none did he do so only
after having the state supreme court deny an application
for review. There is no "well-settled Illinois law" to
the effect that two applications to the state supreme
court must be made in order to avoid waiver of constitutional rights, And if such a requirement did exist it
certainly would not be reasonable.' Consequently I am
unable to agree that the doctrine of waiver applied here
to deprive a man of his personal freedom in violation of
6 Even the opinions of the Illinois appellate courts in this proceeding
would not enlighten future litigants because they do not mention the
fact that writ of error was denied by the supreme court before review
in the appellate court was sought. See 328 Ill. App. 46 and 396 Ill.

his constitutional rights is a reasonable state procedure
within the Central Union case.!
By stating that the petition for certiorari is not timely
if it challenges the original order, the Court repeats its
mistake of treating the so-called amended order as something entirely separate and distinct from the original
contempt order. But with the two orders viewed as the
sarne, there is clearly no question of timeliness. For the
denial of writ of error by the Illinois Supreme Court left
state issues that went to. the core of the litigation for
determination by appeal through the intermediate state
court. The situation therefore is not the one presented
in Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, 329 U. S. 69, where
the only things remaining to be done were ministerial
acts in the trial, court. , Here, even if nothing more was
left for the trial court to do, a great deal more was left
to be done by the Illinois Appellate Court, namely, to
review and determine all questions of state law presented
in the case.8 The Richfield decision- had no relation to
a split procedure for review in the state.courts such as
this, sending federal'questions to one tribunal and state
questions to another. Until the final judgment was entered by the Supreme Court of Illinois on May 19, 1947,
in review of the Illinois Appellate Court's judgment, the
core of the litigation had not been terminated '"by fully
determining the rights of the parties." Gospel Army v.
Los Angeles, 331 U. S.543, 546. For only then were the
state questions finally adjudicated. Hence any. earlier
application for certiorari would have mef with the in7

superable obstacle that we were without jurisdiction, for
want of any final judgment.'
Petitioner was thus placed in a second dilemma, arising
in the appellate stage of the state proceedings. He first
followed the only course afforded by the state procedure
for securing review of his federal constitutional questions.
When they were determined against him he was barred
from coming here because state questions remained to
be decided by the intermediate appellate court and thus
as a matter of federal law under our decisions the judgment was not final. In order to surmount this jurisdictional hurdle petitioner then went to the only place he
could go, the intermediate appellate court. When it
decided the state issues against him, he took the necessary further step of going again to the state supreme
court. Its adverse decision finally closed the trap upon
him. For the first time a judgment dispositive of the
whole controversy was rendered, and thus the way opened
under federal law for review of the federal questions here.
]put at the same instant that door was closed, by applicaion of the Illinois rule that taking appeal to the intermediate court "waived" petitioner's federal rights. And
that ruling held on his application for rehearing.
I I can imagine no better way to annihilate constitutional rights, both substantively and procedurally, than
9Cf. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, 252 U. S. 567, 259 U. S.530.
It has been suggested that on the record we cannot ascertain whether
the Illinois Supreme Court's denial of review of the order of January
15th was on federal or state grounds. But when the only purpose
of review under state law can be to sect re decision of federal questions and no more appears from the syate court's order than that
the application for review was denied, this.Court has refused to allow
a presumption that the denial was on state grounds only to cut
off review here of federal constitutional questions determinative of
the citizen's liberty. Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U. S. 471, 478, and
authorities cited.

thus dovetailing federal jurisdictional limitations with
state procedural ones. To secure review of federal questions here, petitioner must exhaust his state remedies.
But if he exhausts those remedies he "waives" the federal
questions.
This is not waiver. It is nullification.
I do not thirik
Congress intended to countenance such a denial by the
requirement of finality or that its effect, in conjunction
with state procedures, should be to cut off the very rights
which the jurisdictional authorization for reviewing final
judgments was enacted to safeguard.
The issue of federal procedure in this case is not one of
timeliness. It is rather one of finality, now applied to
deny rather than to assure review in protection of personal
liberty from invasion by unconstitutional state action.
Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville, supra, contemplated
no such paradox."' Nor, to my knowledge, has any other
decision of this Court. As a matter of federal procedure
petitioner did not waive his constitutional rights either
by failing to seek certiorari from the Illinois Supreme
Court's judgment of January 23, 1945, or by taking the
necessary steps to seek the writ when he appealed to the
state intermediate-appellate court.
The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court should be
reversed.

10 It is suggested that the Central Union case implicitly held that. a
judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court adjudicating the federal issues
in a case is final even though state issues remain unresolved. That
case, however, waA decided on the express assumption that the Illinois
Supreme Court would pass on the federal question%'together with all
the other questions in the 'case." 269 U. S. 190, 195. (Emphasis
added.) Of course the state supreme court judgment is final when
it settles all the state issues as well as the federal issues.
