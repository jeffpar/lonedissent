CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPILALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 400.

Argued February 5, 1948.-Decided March 15, 1948.

1. Basing jurisdiction on diversity of. citizenship, certain minor children sued an interstate railroad in a federal-court in Utah to recover
damages -for the death of their father, an employee of the railroad,
who was killed in Utah while riding the railroad as an interstate
passenger on a free pass, not in connection with his duties as an
emiloyee. The pass provided that the user assumed all risk of
injury and absolved the railroad from any liability therefor. Under
instructions withholding an issue of the railroad's ordinary negligence and submitting only an issue of its wanton negligence,.,the
jury found for the railroad. Held: Judgment for the railroad
affirmed. Pp. 446-450.
(a) In view of a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of
Utah to similar effect, this-Court cannot say that the Circuit Court
of Appeals committed plain error in holding that defenses which
would have been available in a suit by the decedent were available
in a suit by the heirs on a separate and distinct cause of action
created by Utah law; and, therefore, this Court will not overrule
that holding under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. Pp.
447-448.
(b) Under the Hepburn Act, as amended by.the Transportation
Act of 1940, the right of an employee of an interstate railroad to
recover damages for injuries sustained while riding on a free pass
is governed by federal law. Pp. 448-450.

DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioners are the minor children of Jack R. Francis
who was killed while riding as an interstate passenger on
one of respondent's trains. They brought this suit, acting
through their general guardians, to recover damages on
account of his death. Jurisdiction in the federal court
was founded on diversity of citizenship. The trial judge
submitted to the jury only the question of respondent's
wanton negligence. The error alleged is his refusal to
submit to the jury the issue of ordinary negligence. The
jury returned a verdict for respondent. -The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed. 162 F. 2d 813.

Opinion of the Court.

The Circuit Court of Appeals held that Utah law creates a right of action in the heirs for the wrongful death
of the decedent and that the action is distinct from
any which decedent might have maintained had he survived. But the court held that the action is maintainable
only where the decedent could have recovered damages
for his injury if death had not ensued. In this case the
decedent, an employee of respondent, was riding on a free
pass not in connection with any duties he had as an employee but as a passenger only. The Circuit Court of
Appeals therefore held 'as a matter of' federal law that
respondent would not have been liable to decedent for
damages caused by ordinary negligence, relying on Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Adams, 192 U. S.440. It concluded
that respondent had the same defense against the heirs.
We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari to reexamine the relationship between local law and federal law
respecting the liability of interstate carriers under free
passes.
In Van Wagoner v. Union Pac. R. Co., -. Utah -, 186
P. 2d 293, decided after the petition for certiorari in the
present case was filed, the heirs sued to recover damages
.for the death of the decedent in a grade-crossing accident.
The court held that a defense of contributory negligence
which would have barred recovery by the decedent likewise bars the heirs. In view of this ruling by the Utah
Supreme Court we cannot say that the Circuit Court of
Appeals committed plain error in holding-that respondent
had the same defenses against petitioners as it would
have had against the decedent.1 Yet it requires such
showing of error for us to Overrule the lower courts in
'The Utah Supreme Court in its original opinion in the Van
Wagoner case stated that the.right granted the heirs is a "right- to
proceed against the wrongdoer subject to the defenses available
against the deceased, had he lived and prosecuted the suit." .On

,The free pass in the present case stated that "'the user
assumes all risk bf injury to person or property and of
loss of property whether by negligence or otherwise, and
absolves the issuing company . . . from any liability
therefor." .In Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Adams, supra,
a similar provision in a free pass Was sustained as a defense to an action brought under an Idaho statute by
the heirs of a passenger.2 That was in 1904. The Adams
ing one substituted: "Under the facts of this case the right to proceed
against the wrongdoer is subject to the defense of contributory
negligence." 189 P. 2d 701.
That ruling is no deviation from the Utah law as construed by the
lower federal courts. It supports the view of Utah law taken by
the Circuit Court ofAppeals and is in line with the weight of authority in the state courts. See Mellon v. Goodyear, 277 U. S. 335,
344-345. Hence. we do not deem it appropriate to remand the case
for consideration of the intervening decision in the Van Wagoner
case. Cf. Huddleston v. Dwyer, 322 U. S.232.
2The.Court said, pp. 453-454:
"The .railway company was not as to Adams a carrier for hire. It
waived its right as a common carrier to exact compensation. It
offered'him the privilege of riding in its coaches without charge if
he would assume the risks of negligence. He was not in the power
of the company and obliged to accept its terms. They stood on an
equal footing. If he had desired to hold it to its common law
obligations to' him as a passenger, he could have paid his fare and
compelled the company to receive and carry him. He freely and
,pluntarily chose to accept the privilege offered, and having accepted that privilege cannot repudiate the conditions. It was not a
benevolent association, but doing a railroad business for profit; and
free passengers are not so many as to induce negligence on its part.
So far as the element of contract controls, it was a contract which
neither party was bound to enter into, and y'et one which each was
at liberty to make, and no public policy was violated thereby."

decision was soon followed by Boering v. Chesapeake
Beach R. Co., 193 U. S. 442. Then in 1906 came the
Hepburn Act which under pain of a criminal penalty prohibited a common carrier subject to the Act from issuing
a "free pass" except, inter alia, to "its employees and their
families." 34 Stat. 584, 49 U. S. C. ยง 1 (7). Thereafter
in 1914 the Court held that the rule of the Adams. case
was applicable under the federal statute and that the "free
pass" was nonetheless a gratuity though issued to an employee of the carrier. Charleston & W. C. R. Co. v.
Thompson, 234 U. S.576. Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Van
Zant, .260 U. S.459, followed in 1923 and held that the
liability of an interstate carrier to one riding on a "free
pass" was determined not by state law but by the Hepburn Act. The Court said, p. 468, "The provision for
passes, with its sanction in penalties, is a regulation of
interstate commerce to the completion of which the determination of the effect of the passes is necessary. We
think, therefore, free passes in their entirety are taken
charge of, not only their permission and use, but the
limitations and conditions upon their usa. Or to put it
another way, and to specialize, the relation of their users
to the railroad which issued them, the fact and measure
of responsibility the railroad incurs by their issue, and
the extent of the right the person to whom issued acquires,
are taken charge of."
. For years this has been the accepted and well-settled
construction of the Hepburn Act. During that. long
period it stood unchallenged in this Court and; so far as
we can ascertain, in Congress too. Then came the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 898, 900, with its comprehensive revision of the statutes of which the Hepburn
Act was part. Amendments were made to the free-pass
provision of the Act to permit free transportation of additional classes of persons.' No other amendments to the

free-pass provision were made. It was reenacted without further change or qualification. In view of this history we do not reach the question of what construction we
would give the Hepburn Act were we writing on a clean
slate. The extent to which we should rely upon such
history is always a difficult question which has frequently
troubled the Court in many fields of law and with varied
results. See Girouardv. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69,
70; Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119, 123. But
in the setting of this case, we find the long and wellsettled construction of the Act plus reenactment of the
free-pass provision without change of the established
interpretation most persuasive indications that the rule
of the Adams, Thompson, and Van Zant cases has become
part of the warp and woof of the legislation. See Missouri v. Ross, 299 U. S. 72, 75; United States v. Elgin,
J. & E. R. Co., 298 U. S. 492, 500; United States v. Ryan,
284 U. S. 167, 175; Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 153;
Electric Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, 307 U. S. 5, 14. Any
state law which conflicts with this federal rule governing interstate carriers must therefore give way by
virtue of the Supremacy Clause. For it was held in the
Van Zant case that the free-pass provision of the Hepburn
Act was a regulation of interstate commerce "to the completion of which the determination of -the effect of the
passes is necessary." Thus there is no room for the application of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, on this phase
of the case. The Van Zant case arose not in a lower
federal court but in a state court; the holding was not
a declaration of a "general commercial law" but a ruling
that "the incidents and consequences" of the pass were
controlled by the federal act. "to the exclusion of state
laws and state policies." 260 U. S.at 469.
Petitioners contend that the jury panel from which the
jury in this case was selected was drawn contrary to Thiel

to inquire into the merits of the claim. The objection
was made for the first time in the motion for a new trial.
It seems to have been an afterthought, as the Thiel case
was decided a few weeks after the verdict of the jury in
the present case. If not an afterthought, it is an effort
to retrieve a position that was forsaken when it was decided to take a gamble on the existing jury. panel. In
either case the objection comes too late. Cf. Queenan v.
Oklahoma, 190 U. S. 548, 552.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUgTICE"MURPHY
and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE join, dissenting..

Utah law permits recovery against a railroad when its
negligence is responsible for a passenger's death, whether
that passenger rides on a free pass containing an attempted Waiver of liability for negligence or pays his fare
in money. Because I believe Utah law should govern
this case I would reverse this judgment. But I think
affirmance of the judgment is equally wrong whether the
case is to be considered governed wholly by Utah law, by
federal law, or in part by both.
No act of Congress has entrenched upon the long-existing power of all the states, including Utah, to provide'
damages for such wrongful deaths as this complaint alleged. If there is here any barrier to recovery based
upon federal law, it is grounded in judge-made "general
commercial law" announced by this Court in the year
1904 in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Adams, 192 U. S. 440.
The rule laid down in that case was that a railroad could
by stipulation validly exempt itself from liability under a
state statute for negligent injuries inflicted within that
state upon passeugers cprried wholly gratuitously. Creation of the 1904 Adams rule by. this Court was under
authority of a power then exercised, but repudiated in
1938 in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, whereby

federal courts, in passing upon questions of state law upon
which there was no controlling state legislative enactment, declared the "general commercial law" of a, state on
the federal court'snotionof wise public policy, independently of state court decisions.
This Court followed the Adams "general commercial
law" state rule several times between its creation in 1904
and repudiation of this Court's power to create state law
in 1938-the last application of the Adams rule having
been made by this Court in'1923 in Kansas City So. R.
Co. v. Van Zant, 260 U. S. 459. That decision stated
that an act of Congress had made the effect of the conditions in an employee's pass a federal question, but
decided that "federal" question entirely by reliance on
the old Adams "general commercial law" state rule. Since
the Erie-Tompkins decision in 1938, and in fact since
1923, the Adams rule has never been applied by this Court
until today. Now it is applied not as a federally created
state rule of "general commercial law" but as a judicially
created post-Erie-Tompkins rule of purely federal law.
While this Court may look to the 1904 pre-Erie-Tompkins
state rule of general commercial law "as a con !enient
source of reference for fashioning" a post-Erie-Tompkins
federal rule, Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318
U. S.363, 367, it should not, as the Court does here, automatically accept the old state rule as a federal rule, without any appraisal of its soundness in relation 6. present
day conditions. . No such appraisal has been made here.
The old Adams rule, questionable enough in its 1904 environrint, should in my judgment be critically examined
and then abandoned as wholly incongruous with the
accepted pattern of our modern society as embodied in
legislative enactments.
Furthermore, the 1904 Adams rule, even in its original
narrow scope, marked a departure from the philosophy
.of this Court's previous decisions. One subsequent line

of the Court's decisions has tended to limit the 1904
rule's scope while another has tended to expand it.
Today's opinion expands that rule beyond any point it
has before reached. As indicated, I think the Adams
"general commercial law" state rule is an obstacle to the
execution of present congressional policies embodied in
statutes. That obstacle I think should be removed by
this Court which fashioned the old rule. In any event,
I certainly would not expand the old Adams rule to cover
the facts of this case.

ideas of many. But if judges make rules of law, it would
"Seem that they should keep their minds open in order to

might prove that a rule created by judges should never

and social conditions developed by a dynamic society.
A revaluation of social and economic interests affected by
the old rule might reveal the unwisdom of its expansion
or imperatively require its revision or abandonment.
The Court's uncritical reliance today on the 1904 judicially created rule, which to me is both undesirable and
uncertain in scope, emphasizes one of the inherent dangers

commentator in the field of tort law. Professor Bohlen,
in his Studies in the Law of Torts, 610-611 (1926), had
this to say about "dangers" of court-made tort standards:
"The first is that of the ulidue rigidity which results from
the unfortunate feeling, that any decision of a court creates a rule of law which, as law, is absolutely and eternally
valid. . . . To regard a standard of conduct as fixed

"II.

In 1944, Jack Francis, aged 30, his wife, aged 29, and
their three children, aged 3, 6, and 8, lived in Carlin,
Nevada. Jack was then and had been for several years

a conductor and brakeman for the respondent, Southern
Pacific iCompany. His father, Ray E. Francis had served
the respondent in the same capacity for 35 years. The
elder Francis and his wife lived in Ogden, Utah, and the

young Francis family visited them Christmas week.

In

the early morning of December 31, Jack and his wife
boarded a Southern Pacific train at Ogden bound for
Carlin.- They took seats in the rear car. Both had

passes granted by the respondent because the husband
was its employee. Each pass contained a printed stipulation that the user assumed "all risk of injury to person"
and absolved the railroad "from any liability therefor."
A short distance out of Ogden, while the train was still

eternal certainty in the law: "I was much troubled in spirit, in my
first years upon the bench, to find how trackless was the ocean on
which I had embarked. I sought for certainty. I was oppressed
and disheartened when I found that the quest for it was futile....
As the years have gone by, and as I have reflected more and more
upon the nature of the judicial process, I have become reconciled
to the uncertainty, because I have grown to see it as inevitable. I
have grown to see that the process in its highest reaches is not, discovery, but creation; and that the doubts and misgivings, the hopes
and fears, are part of the travail of mind, the pangs of death and
the pangs of birth, in which principles that have served their day
expire, and new principles are born." The Nature of the Judicial

in Utah, an engine and train of cars crashed into the rear
car. Husband and wife were killed.
This is one of two suits brought against the railroad by
the grandparents as guardians of the three children to
recover damages on account of their parents' deaths.
The actions were brought under a Utah law since Congress
has never passed any act which provides remedies against
railroads for negligently injuring or killing railroad passengers, even interstate passengers on interstate-railroads.
Whether passengers or their dependents shall have a
right of action under such circumstances has been a question left by Congress for regulation by the state in which
the injury or death occurred. See, e. g., Chicago, R. I. &
P. R. Co. v. Maucher, 248 U. S.359, 363. See also cases
collected in 76 A. L. R. 428-435.
For many years the states did not generally authorize
suits for 'wrongful death. Their omission of such remedies was due to traditional "common law" hostility to
recoveries for death. This hostility provoked much lay
criticism, echoes of which may be found in the cases cited
below.2 About the middle of the last century, because of
"dissatisfaction -with the archaisms of the law," state
legislatures began to abolish the common law rule by
specifically authorizing suits for wrongful death and now
all states.have such statutes. Van 21eeck v. Sabine Towing Co., 300 U. S.342, 346, 350-351. So strong is Utah's
antipathy to the common law attitude that Art. XVI,
ยง 5, of the Utah Constitution forbids the state legislature to abrogate the right to recoyer damages for wrongful death. This suit for damages was brought under the

Utah statute enacted in accordance with that state constitutional policy. Utah Code Ann. ยง 104-3-1-1 (1943).
And in a case involving a federal wrongful death statute
this Court has said "It would be a misfortune if a narrow
or grudging process of construction were to exemplify and
perpetuate the very evils to be remedied" by such statutes; Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., supra at 350351.
One count-of the complaint here alleged ordinary negliโขgence; the other alleged gross negligence. Either type of
negligence would justify a recovery under the Utah statute. And since the complaint claimed recovery under the
Utah statute, liability, if any, springs from that statute.
'See Spokane & I. E. R. Co. v. Whitley, 237 U. S. 487,494495. Under Utah law the railroad here could not have
defeated liability in this case on the ground that the passes
stipulated that the users would assume the risk of injury.
The trial judge charged the jury, however, that because
of opinions of this Court the pass exemption stipulation
was valid and barred recovery "for just ordinary negli-,
gence." The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on the
basis of this Court's Adams and Van Zant cases. 162 F.
2d 813, 816. The action of the two lower courts was in
accordance with their interpretation of this Court's opinions notwithstanding the fact that long ago the Utah
Supreme Court, in declaring state law, rejected such a
contention in the following language: "It is argued that
even if the ticket was a free pass gratuitously possessed
with the conditions printed thereon, still the defendant
could not escape liability for its negligence. We believe
the plaintiff is correct in this contention." Williams v.
Oregon Short Line R. Co., 18 Utah 210, 221, 54 P. 991,

Court has itself recognized and acted on the fact that
it is the law of Utah that "when a common carrier accepts
a person as a passenger, he is not permitted to deny that
he owes to him the duty of diligence prudence, and skill,
which, as carrying on a public employment, he owes to
all his passengers; and that he cannot escape liability
for a negligent performance of that duty resulting in
injury by urging that the pass or commission was issued,
or the gratuitous passage permitted, by him,
in violation'
of law." Southern Pac. Co. v. Schuyler, 227 U. S. 601,
609-610.'
In the Schuyler case this Court sustained a Utah judg-

ment under the Utah wrongful death statute, which judgment permitted recovery for death of a "gratuitous" passenger killed while riding free, although assuming he was
3

The recent Van Wagoner Utah Supreme Court dgcision cited by
the Court is not out of harmony with the above cases but, as amended
on rehearing, is expressly limited to a holding that contributory
negligence of a decedent may bar recovery under the Utah statute
on the part of his heirs. That holding simply means that the. death
was not "wrongful" under the statute. It does not mean that where
there is company negligence Utah would hold that a railroad could
barter away the beneficiary's rights.
And as I read the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the
case now before us, it did not hold that under Utah law an action
is maintainable only where "the decedent could have maintained an
action to recover damages for his injury if death had not ensued."
For that statement in its opinion, the Circuit Court of Appeals
relieq'only on the Adams case and several other opinions of this
Court. It did not purport to be construing Utah law. On this
point, therefore, there is no question presented as to whether the
Circuit Court of Appeals made a "plain error" in'the construction
of, state law. The state law on that subject has been very clearly
stated by the State Supreme Court to the effect that it "is beyond
the power of the Legislature to take from the dependents of an
employee their claim against the employer, where such employee dies
as the result of a wrongful injury by the employer." Hailing v. Industrial Comm'n of Utah, 71 Utah 112,-120-121, 263 P. 78, 80-81.

not a member of a group to whom the carrier might lawfully issue passes under the Hepburn Act. The Schuyler
case held that the Hepburn Act did not deprive Schuyler,
"of the benefit and protection of the law
who violated it,
of the State," because "such a violator" was "a human
being, of whose safety the plaintiff in error [railroad] had
undertaken the charge." Jack Francis and his wifewere
not violators of the Hepburn Act or any other act, federal
or state. Each of them "was a human being of whose
safety the railroad had taken charge." But by today's
decision their children are denied the benefit ,of Utah's
law. A federal rule of law is said to compel this Court
to bar recovery under Utah's statute.
III.
What is this federal rule of law? Where did a rule
emanate Which today constrains this Court, without appraisal of the rule's scope or merits, to deny these children
a right to recover damages from a railroad that negligently
killed their parents? I say "negligently killed" because
that must be assumed since the Court affirms a judgment
against the children in a case where the jury was denied
a right to award damages for a killing caused by the
"ordinary negligence" of the railroad.
The Court points to no records and I can find not a
single shred of evidence that Congress has ever directly
or indirectly, explicitly or impliedly, through the Hepburn
Act, or through any other act, authorized railroads to
contract against liability for their negligence which results in the injury or death of a railroad employee or
any other.person legAlly riding on a railroad pass. The
original rule followed in an expanded form by the Court
today is actually a judicial product of the old days of
Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1 (1842), days in which federal
courts invoked "a transcendental body of law outside of

Co. v.
Tompkins, supra, repudiated in toto the old Swift v.
Tyson, "transcendental" or "general commercial law"
power of federal courts. But as I see this case, the Court
now perpetuates and strengthens the old rule based on the
repudiated Swift v. Tyson doctrine, and the rule applied
today rests on no other foundation than a completely uncritica4 adoption of this Court's 1904 "independent judgment." That judgment held it to 6e bad public policy,
indeed, offensive to the Court's "moral sense," for a state
to provide thrt an injured passenger who rode on a wholly
gratuitous and guest basis could recover damages if a
railroad had cautiously ptipulated in advance that such
a free passenger must'assume the risks of railroad negligence. An investigation of the evolution of the "rule"
from its 1904 beginning and application to its much
broader applicttion today will demonstrate, I believe,
that it is rooted now, as in 1904, in.nothing but the original
"tfanscendental general law" source.
IV.
" The background of the 1904 rule' throws light on its
judicial "general law" origin. In 1852 this Court was
unable to find any difference between the kinq of duty
owed by a railroad to its paying and non-paying passengers; "public policy and safety" were held to require that
.a railroad exercise "the greatest possible care and diligence" for the safety of all passengers, and, any less.
measure of care entitled an injured passenger to recover.

357, 382-383. In 1873, this Court in an elaborate and
well-reasoned opinion held that it was against the public
interest and public policy to permit common carriers to
stipulate against the results of the negligence of. themselves or their agents, and that while the rule applied both
to carriage of goods and passengers, it applied with "special force to the latter." Railroad Company v. Lockwood, supra at 384. The passenger in the Lockwood case
was a drover traveling on a free pass to look after cattle;
the Court reserved decision as to whether the rule would
apply, to a strictly free passenger. Four years later the
Court applied the same reasoning to a railroad-designated
"free pass"- passenger, finding that in fact there was consideration for the carriage and that it was not a "matter
of charity" or a "mere gratuity." Railway Company v.
Stevens, 95 U. S. 655, 658, 660. The Lockwood and
Stevens cases plainly stand for the principle that where
there is any benefit ded-red by the railroad a pass is not
"free," and that a passenger riding on such a pass may
4 The Court said: "...
It is true, a distinction has been taken, in
some cases, between simple negligence, and great or gross negligence;
and it is said, that one who acts gratuitously is liable only for the
latter. But this case does not call upon us to define the difference,
(if it be capable of definition,) as the verdict has found this to be a
case of gross negligepce.
"When carriers undertake to convey persons by the powerful but
-dangerous agency of steam, public policy and safety require that
they be held to the greatest possible care and diligence. And whether
the consideration for such transportation be pecuniary or otherwise,
the personal safety of the passengers should not be left to the sport
of chance or the negligence of careless agefits. Any negligence, in
such casbs, may well deserve the epithet of 'gross.'"

recover for injuries due to the railroad's negligence,.
regardless of stipulations in his pass.
In the Lockwood case this Court refused to follow
decisions of the Supreme Court of New York, the State
where the carriage contract was made and where the
accident occurred, but instead, since there was no controlling New York statute, expressly decided the point
as one of "general commercial law." 17 Wall. at 368.
And see Chicago, Milwaukee & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, 169
U. S.133, 136-137. Out of this "general commercial law"
background emerged the "rule" relied on by the Court
in the Adams case.
V.
The beginning of the doctrine that a railroad .could
by stipulation exempt itself from liability for negligent
injury to strictly free passengers was in NorthernPac. R.
Co. v. Adams, supra, and Boering v. ChesapeakeBeach R.
Co., 193 U. S. 442, both decided in 1904. -The decisions
in these cases bear internal _proof that they rested on the
"general commercial law" ground. The Adams opinion
treated the newly announced doctrine as no more than
a special exception to the rule of "general commercial
law" of the Lockwood case, which rule denied railroads
power to exempt themselves from the effects of their
negligence through the device of "free" passes..
As bearing on the narrow scope of the Adams rule and
its "transcendental law" origin, it is of importance that
the Adams and Boering cases were decided in 1904, two
years before Congress outlawed political passes in the
Hepburn Act. There existed at that time a widespread
hostility to the use of "strictly free" railroad passes. The
pass in the Boering case as well as in the Adams case was
"strictly free." Adams, the deceased, was a lawyer but
not employed by the railroad that, gave him the pass.
Many believed, as shown by the legislative history of the

Hepburn Act, that railroads were using passes to influence
public men to favor railroads at the expense of the public
good. Consequently, pass givers and pass users of
"strictly free" passes, as distinguished from givers and
users of employees' passes, were in bad repute. The,
Adams and Boering decisions plainly reflect'this sentiment. Both decisions spotlighted the importance of hav.ing "those who accept gratuities and acts of hospitality"
stand by' their contracts to assume the risks of injury
incident to riding. In the Lockwood and Stevens cases,
where no money was paid for passage, but neither carriage was strictly free, interests of the public in a carefully operated railroad system were expressly held to
outweigh sanctity of contracts and all other considerntions; in the Adams and Boering cases, sanctity of
contracts, particularly contracts made to obtain strictly
free transportation, was given greater weight than the
public's interest in safe transportation.' But all the
cases alike turned out judge-made rules of "general
commercial law." Now let us follow the Adams rule to
its appearance in other cases relied on by the Court today
for the statement that this rule of "general commercial
law" has become part of the "warp and woof" of the
Hepburn Act.
Charleston & W. C. R. Co. v. Thompson, 234 U. S. 576,
is the next case relied on here. It was decided in 1914,
eight years after passage of the Hepburn Act, which had,
with certain exceptions, prohibited issuance of passes by
railroads. 34 Stat. 584, 49 U. S. C. ยง 1 (7).. The suit
was brought by the wife bf a railroad employee to recover
for injuries sustained by her while an interstate railroad

passenger riding on a pass. The Court of Appeals of
Georgia considered it to be the general rule that strictly
free pass passengers could not recover for injuries if their
passes contained a stipulation requiring the passenger to
assume the risk of railroad negligence. But that court
went on to hold that the Hepburn Act, by specifically
authorizing issuance of passes to railroad employees and
their families, had put them in a different category from
"purely gratuitous" passengers. The court regarded
passes issued to members of an employee's family as
partial compensation for the employee's services, and for
that reason distinguished persons riding on such pass6s
from strictly free pass passengers, to whom the harsh
Adams rule applied. 13 Ga. App. 528, 80 S.E. 1097.
This Court reversed, saying that "The main question is
whether when the statute permits the issue of a 'free pass'
to its employds and their families it means what it says."
It did not find that the pass on which the injured wife of
the employee had ridden was free in fact, but held that the
"pass was free under the statute," thereby treating employees' passes as though they were strictly free, without
stating any reason except that the Hepburn Act had
referred to passes as "free." Cf. Norfolk Southern R. Co.
v. Chatman, 244 U. S. 276, 280-281. The Court then
went further and upheld the pass stipulations for.railroad
exemption from liability for negligence. But the Court
did not at all rely on the Hepburn Act for this latter holding. Instead it was said that "As the pass was free under
the statute . . . the validity of its stipulations" Was '!es-

tablished by the. decisions of this court," relying completely upon the Adams ind Boering cases. Thus the
Charleston& W. C.-R. Co. case did not discover the Adams
rule in an act of Congress; the'rule it relied on had been
judicially created in 1904 by an exercise of the Court's
"transcendental" law power.

Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Van Zant, 260 U. S. 459,

decided in 1923, is the next and the last case relied on
by.the Court. today. That case decided that the "incidents and consequences" of an employee's pass raise a
federal question. Cf.. Southern Pac. Co. v. Schuyler, 227
U. S. 601., 610; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Maucher,
248 U: S.359, 363. It then repeated the statement made
in Charleston& W. C. R. Co. v. Thompson, supra, that an
employee's pass transportation is "free," again without
any explanation of why. To this extent it may be said
that the Court was then construing the Hepburn Act,
though I think its construction was wrong. But the
Court did not, even in this last case (1923), hold or intimate that the Hepburn Act of itself put employee-pass
passengers in a .separate class, to be negligently killed
or injured with impunity., To degrade railroad employee
passengers to this unfortunate level this Court in the Van
Zant case again relied on the rule it had fashioned in the
Adams and Boering decisions. So long as one agreed
with the soundness of the Adams case rule and with this
Court's exercise of a power to declare "general commercial law" under the Swift v. Tyson, doctrine, the result of
the Van Zant case could not be questioned in 1923. But
that was fifteen years prior to Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,
supra, in which we abandoned the "transcendental" law
doctrine, as typified by the Adams rule, and today's decision. is ten years after we took that salutary step.
In applying, this pre-Erie-Tompkins court-made transcendental law rule at this time, the Court not only in
part neutralizes our Erie-Tompkins decision. It actually
leaves a rule standing which might have already fallen
under the repudiated Swift v. Tyson doctrine so far as
it governed. For though a purely transcendental law
rule judicially created by this Court under the pre-ErieTompkins doctrine was "none the less the law of the

State," it need only have remained the "law of the State"
until "changed by its legislature." Chicago, Milwaukee,
& St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, 169 U. S. 133, 136-137. Hence,
had the Swift-Tyson doctrine not been repudiated, the
Adams rule as applied to persons injured in Utah should
have fallen of its own weight had the Utah legislature
passed a law authorizing a man's children to recover
from a railroad that negligently killed their parents while
they were "free pass" passengers. Utah has a statute
broad enough to authorize such recoveries. The only
barrier to recovery under that state statute is grounded
on a court-announced "commercial law" rule, a poor excuse indeed for depriving a state of exercising its traditional power to control actions for local wrongful deaths.
Of course this is an interstate carrier and we should not
constrict congressional powers over it by narrow statutory
interpretations. Cf. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Bunte
Bros., 312 U. S. 349. But the very absence of a federal
statute to take the place of local wrongful death statutes
should be the equivalent of a loud congressional warning
to courts to refrain from encroaching on state powers
here.
VI.
It is said however that Congress, although aware of the
Adan's transcendental law rule, has never changed it.
Indulging for the moment the convenient fiction that
Congress knows all about-that rule and what it means,
why should it think that old rules laid down by this Court
and based on the Swift v. Tyson doctrine could survive
our decision in Erie v. Tompkins? And why should Congress think that a rule which had never been applied by
this Court to bar the children ,of a deceased employee
would be extended to bar recovery by those children? I
venture the suggestion that it would be shocking to members of Congress, even those who are, in closest touch with

interstate commerce legislation, to be told that their
"silence" is responsible for application today of a rule
which is out of step with the trend of all congressional
legislation for more than the past quarter of a century.
There are some fields in which congressional committees
have such close liaison with agencies in regard to some
matters, that it is reasonable to assume an awareness of
Congress with relevant judicial. and administrative decisions. But I can find no ground for an assumption that
Congress has known about the Adams rule and deliberately left it alone because it favored such an archaic
doctrineY I reject the idea that Congress ever has approved such a rule, .and none of its legislation for the
past quarter of a century indicates that it ever would
have approved it.
VII.
The legislative history of the Hepburn Act's free pass
provision shows that application of the Adams doctrine
to employees' passes is not in accordance with but directly
hostile to the congressional purpose in permitting employee passes. That Congress never would have passed
an Act which so penalized employees, may be seen -by
reading even the few portions of the Congressional Rec6 The Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, 900, 49 U. S. C.
1 (7), expanded the groups eligible to ride on "free passes." But
no language used in that Act and no legislative history that I have
foundAndicates any congressional knowledge of the existence of the
penalizing Adams rule, much less approval of it. Far from indicating
a purpose to acquiesce in any kind of reduced employee protection,
Congress in ยง 7 (2) (f) of that Act, 49 U. S. C. ยง 5 (2) (f), providibd
a new and evtraordinary protection for employees whose jobs might
be affected by railroad mergers and consolidations. See Sen. Rep.

ord and committee reports cited below.' In very brief
summary that history shows: Prior to 1906, there grew up a demand by the people
that railroads cease discriminating against some shippers
in favor of others and cease using free passes as a means
to obtain special favors from public officials and administrative agencies. Public complaint was not against employees using passes. In fact, some unions had bargaining agreements for passes, and Congressmen who spoke on
the Hepburn bill considered employees' passes to be a part
of the inducement to work for railroads. Passes were
spoken of by those who discussed legislation on the House
and Senate floors as part of the compensation of employees. -The subject was an important one and was so
treated. At one time a conference report recommended
to both houses that all passes be prohibited. 40 Cong.
Rec. 7741. This report was defeated and the debates in740 Cong. Rec. 7741, 7851-7852, 7920-7940, 7978-7998.
The following statement is typical of the sentiment that brought into the
Hepburn Act the exception that permitted issuance of passes to and
use of them by employees: "While I am on my feet I will take the opportunity to say in regard to the pass amendment or provision that I
have received, as other Senators have, a great many telegrams from
railway employees and from organizations of railway employees protesting against any provision being incorporated here that will prevent
them from being supplied with or from accepting free transportation.
I shall not take time to discuss that, as it has been fully discussed.
I simply wish to say that I fully agree with them, and I believe that
we ought not to enact any such legislation, and should we do so it
would, in my judgment, be perpetrating a very great-injustice upon
those people. The matter of free transportation, as the Senator from
Wisconsin [Mr. Spooner] said yesterday, enters partly into the consideration for their employment, and we have no moral right to
deprive them of that privilege." 40 Cong. Rec. 7981. See also
id. at 7984-7985. See Sen. Rep. No. .1242, 59th Cong., 1st Sess.,

dicate that it would have been difficult to pass a bill which
failed to permit issuance of passes to railroad employeesnot in the spirit of giving alms to beggars or favors to
politicians, but to requite men for faithful work.
If any senator or congressman discussing the Hepburn
'Act had ever heard of the Adams rule, he failed to mention
it. But it must be conceded there was no reason for him
to mention it, since the purposes .of the Act bore no relation, directly or remotely, to liability of a railroad for
injury to passengers whether riding on passes or paying
their fares. Even if some member of Congress had been
acquainted with the Adams Fule and had thought that the
Hepburn Act bore some remote relation to the liability
of railroads for injury to passengers, still -he would have
had no reason to believe this Court would subsequently
expand that rule, then applicable only to "strictly free
pass" passengers, to penalize employees and others authorized by Congress to ride on passes. As I see it, today's
decision undermines the purpose Congress had in mind in
approving the long-standing practice of employees' passes.
It perverts an advantage expressly saved to employees
into a penalty for making use of it. It makes traps of
these passes.
VIII.
Moreover, the subjection of railroad employees while
passengers to the hazards of uncompensated injuries is
at war with the basic philosophy which has found expression in other industrial and social legislation for many
years. Employers' liability acts, compensation acts,
social insurance legislation of the federal government and
various states, and a host of other legislative policies have
been grounded upon the basic premise that care of the
accidentally injured should be accepted as a matter of
great public concern. Congress has also erased every
vestige of the old Judicially created fellow-servant and

assumption-of-risk doctrines in connection with suits by
railroad employees on account of injuries suffered in the
course of their employment. Tiller v. Atlantic C. L. R.
Co., 318 U. S. 54. The analogy between these now
repudiated judicially created tort-law doctrines and the
present rule was pressed on the Court iii briefs for the
railroad in the Adams case. Congress has also emphatically outlawed all kinds of stipulations and contracts to
exempt railroads from liability for their negligence in
Employers' Liability Act cases. Duncan v. Thompson,
315 U. S. 1. All of this body of legislation, and much:
more to which reference could be made, has departed from
the premise of the Adams and Boering decisions that it is
more important to society that men abide by ticket and
contract stipulations 8 than it is to have a system which
provides compensation for the industrially injured and
the dependents of those who are killed. For our society
attempts to take care of its aged, unemployed, crippled
and disabled, as well as the dependents of those killed by
our industrial machine. See Georgetown College v.
Hughes, 76 U. S. App. D. C. 123, 130 F. 2d 810, 822-825;
Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Railway Labor Assn.,
315 U. S.373, 376-378. And the present railroad regulatory system is such that payment by railroads for injuries inflicted by them upon passengers is just as certainly borne by the public as though those injured and
their dependents were directly supported by governmental
institutions.
Whether allowance of damages for negligent death is
the best way to meet the problems incident to transpor8 The Boering case was supported by the following statement: "The
result we have reached conforms the law applicable to the present
issue to that moral sense which justly holds those who accept gratuities and acts of hospitality to perform the conditions on which they
are granted." 193 U. S. at 451.

tation dangers is beside the point. Many courts generally, including this one and Utah's, may have been wrong
in thinking that the possibility of having to pay damages
for deaths of passengers due to railroad negligence would
make railroads more cautious.' Perhaps society could
take care of injured passengers and their dependents in a
less wasteful manner. But so long as Congress leaves
the states free to adopt this method of meeting the problem, I think this Court should not handicap the states.
Congress could provide a substitute for the state laws;
we cannot.
Ix.
Today's decision leaves states free to provide that railroads must pay for injury or death of passengers who
can and do pay a full money fare foF passage. This
group is far more likely to include some people who are
better able financially to take care of themselves in case
of injury than are the members of some of the other
groups permitted by the Hepburn Act to ride on free
passes, all of whom are penalized by today's decision.
These groups are in addition- to railroad employees and
their families, employees of other railroads; -ministers of
religion; Young Men's Christian Association workers; inmates of eleemosynary institutions; indigent, destitute,
and homeless persons; disabled soldiers; and others in
analogous categories. In following a course today that

takes all of the above groups out from under the protection of state laws, the Court ignores the signs erected by
Congress. all of which point in the opposite direction.
Assuming the Court is right in saying that a rule with
such consequences has become a part of the warp and
woof of the Hepburn Act, it is a defective part which this
Court alone has woven into the Act and which clashes
with the congressionally fashioned fabric and design.
The result is a motley pattern. I would restore the
original congressional design.
No sound argument has been or can be advanced for
application of the 1904 Adams rule in today's entirely
different judicial and legislative environment, even as the
rule was first narrowly applied to a purely gratuitous carriage, except that it was unquestioningly accepted 34 and
25 years ago .in cases where the rule's soundness was not
challenged. When precedent and precedent alone is all
the argument that can be made to support a courtfashioned rule, it is time for the rule's creator to destroy it.
The Van Zant case did hold that since the Hepburn Act
the "incidents and consequences" of an employee's pass
raised a federal question. It then held that the user of
an employee's pass must stand by his contract to assume
the risks of negligent injury by the railroad. Neither it,
nor any other case since the Hepburn Act, until the case
today, has held that the penalizing consequences of the
father's contract must be visited upon his children. I
would not so extend the more than dubious Van Zant
doctrine.
