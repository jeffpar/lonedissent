BROWN SHOE CO., INC., v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
EASTERN

No. 4.

DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

Argued December 6, 1961.-Decided June 25, 1962.

The Government brought suit to enjoin consummation of a merger
of two corporations, on the ground that its effect might be sbstantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in
the production, distribution and sale of shoes, in violation of § 7
of the Clayton Act, as amended in 1950. The District Court found
that the merger would increase concentration in the shoe industrv,
both in manufacturing and retailing, eliminate one of the corporations as a substantial competitor in the retail field, and establish a manufacturer-retailer relationship which vould deprive all
but the top firms in the industry of a fair opportunity to compete,
and that, therefore, it probably would result in a further :ubstantial
lessening of competition and an increased tendency towardimonopoly. It enjoined appellant from having or acquiring any further
interest in the business, stock, or assets of the other corporation,
required full divestiture by appellant of the other corporation's
stock and assets, and ordered appellant to propose in the immediate
future a plan for carrying into effect the Court's order of divestiture. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 296-346.
1. The District Court's judgment was a "final" judgment within
the meaning of § 2 of the Expediting Act, and this Court has jurisdiction of this direct appeal under that Act. Pp. 304-311.
2. The legislative history of the 1950 amendments to § 7 of the
Clayton Act indicates that Congres.z provided no definite quantitative or qualitative tests by which enforcement agencies were to
gauge the effects of a given merger, but rather tha:t Congress
intended that a variety of economic and other factors be considered
in determining whether the merger was consistent with niaintaining competition in the industry in which the merging conipalics
operated. Pp. 311-323.
3. The record supports the District Court's findings and its conclusion that the shoe industry is being subjected to a cunmulative
series of vertical mergers which, if left unchecked, may substantially lessen competition, within the meaning of § 7, as amended.

(a) The record in this case supports the District Court's
finding that the relevant lines of commerce are men's, women's and
children's shoes. Pp. 325-326.
(b) The District Court properly found that the predominantly
medium-priced shoes which appellant manufactures do not occupy
a product market different from the predominantly low-priced
shoes which the other corporation sells. P. 326.
(c) In defining the product market, the District Court was not
required to employ finer "price/quality" or "age/sex" distinctions
than those recognized by its classifications of "men's," "women's"
and "children's" shoes. Pp. 326-328.
(d) Insofar as the vertical aspect of this merger is concerned,
the relevant geographic market is the entire Nation, and the anti,
competitive effects of the merger are to be measured within that
range of distribution. P. 328.
(e) The trend toward vertical integration in the shoe industry,
when combined with appellant's avowed policy of forcing its own
shoes upon its retail subsidiaries, seems likely to foreclose competition from a substantial share of the markets for men's, women's
and children's shoes, without producing any countervailing competitive, economic or social advantages. Pp. 328-334.
4. The District Court was correct in concluding that this merger
may tend to lessen competition substantially in the retail sale of
men's, women's and children's shoes in the overwhelming majority
of the cities and their environs in which both corporations sell
through owned or controlled outlets. Pp. 334-346.
(a) The District Court correctly defined men's, women's and
children's shoes as the relevant lines of commerce in which to
analyze the horizontal aspects of the merger. P. 336.
(b) The District Court properly defined the relevant geographic markets in which to analyze the horizontal aspects of this
merger as those cities with populations exceeding 10,000 and their
environs in which both corporations retailed shoes through their
own or controlled outlets. Pp. 336-339.
(c) The evidence is adequate to support the finding of the
District Court that, as a result of the merger, competition in the
retailing of men's, women's and children's shoes may be lessened
substantially in those cities. Pp. 339-346.

delivered the opinion of

I.

This suit was initiated in November 1955 when the
Government filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging
that a contemplated merger between the G. R. Kinney
Company, Inc. (Kinney), and the Brown Shoe Company,
Inc. (Brown), through an exchange of Kinney for Brown
stock, would violate § 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C.
§ 18. The Act, as amended, provides in pertinent part:
"No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part
of the stock or other share capital . . . of another
corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any
line of commerce in any section of the country, the
effect of such acquisition may be substantially to
lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
The complaint sought injunctive relief under § 15 of the
Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 25, to restrain consummation
of the merger.
A motion by the Government for a preliminary injunction pendente lite was denied, and the companies were
permitted to merge provided, however, that their businesses be operated separately and that their assets be kept
separately identifiable. The merger was then effected
on May 1, 1956.

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.

297

Opinion of the Court.

In the District Court, the Government contended that
the effect of the merger of Brown-the third largest seller
of shoes by dollar volume in the United States, a leading
manufacturer of men's, women's, and children's shoes,
and a retailer with over 1,230 owned, operated or controlled retail outlets '-and Kinney-the eighth largest
company, by dollar volume, among those primarily engaged in selling shoes, itself a large manufacturer of shoes,
and a retailer with over 350 retail outlets-"may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a
monopoly" by eliminating actual or potential competition in the production of shoes for the national wholesale
shoe market and in the sale of shoes at retail in the
Nation, by foreclosing competition from "a market represented by Kinney's retail outlets whose annual sales
exceed $42,000,000," and by enhancing Brown's competitive advantage over other producers, distributors and
sellers of shoes. The Government argued that the "line
of commerce" affected by this merger is "footwear," or
alternatively, that the "line[s]" are "men's," "women's,"
and "children's" shoes, separately considered, and that the
"section of the country," within which the anticompetitive effect of the merger is to be judged, is the Nation as
a whole, or alternatively, each separate city or city and its
I Of these over 1,230 outlets under Brown's control at the time of
the filing of the complaint, Brown owned and operated over 470,
while over 570 were independently owned stores operating under the
Brown "Franchise Program" and over 190 were independently owned
outlets operating under the "Wohl Plan." A store operating under
the Franchise Program agrees not to carry competing lines of shoes
of other manufacturers in return for certain aid from Brown; a store
under the Wohl Plan similarly agrees to concentrate its purchases on
lines which Brown sells through Wohl in return for credit and
merchandising aid. See note 66, infra. In addition, Brown shoes
were sold through numerous retailers operating entirely independently
of Brown.

immediate surrounding area in which the parties sell
shoes at retail.
In the District Court, Brown contended that the merger
would be shown not to Endanger competition if the
"line[s] of commerce" and the "section[s] of the country" were properly determined. Brown urged that not
only were the age and sex of the intended customers to
be considered in determining the relevant line of commerce, but that differences in grade of material, quality
of workmanship, price, and customer use of shoes resulted
in establishing different lines of commerce. While agreeing with the Government that, with regard to manufacturing, the relevant geographic market for assessing the
effect of the merger upon competition is the country as a
whole, Brown contended that with regard to retailing, the
market must vary with economic reality from the central
business district of a large city to a "standard metropolitan area" 2 for a smaller community. Brown further contended that, both at the manufacturing level and at the
retail level, the shoe industry enjoyed healthy competition and that the vigor of this competition would not, in
any event, be diminished by the proposed merger because
Kinney manufactured less than 0.5% and retailed less
than 2% of the Nation's shoes.
The District Court rejected the broadest contentions
of both parties. The District Court found that "there is
one group of classifications which is understood and recog2 "The general concept adopted in defining a standard metropolitan
area [is] that of an integrated economic area with a large volume
of daily travel and communication between a central city of 50,000
inhabitants or more and the outlying parts of the area. . . Each
area (except in New England) consists of one or more entire counties.
In New England, metropolitan areas have been defined on a town
basis rather than a county basis." II U. S. Bureau of the Census,
United States Census of Business: 1954, p. 3.

nized by the entire industry and the public-the classification into 'men's,' 'women's' and 'children's' shoes separately and independently." On the other hand, "[t]o
classify shoes as a whole could be unfair and unjust; to
classify them further would be impractical, unwarranted
and unrealistic."
Realizing that "the areas of effective competition for
retailing purposes cannot be fixed with mathematical precision," the District Court found that "when determined
by economic reality, for retailing, a 'section of the country'
is a city of 10,000 or more population and its immediate
and contiguous surrounding area, regardless of name designation, and in which a Kinney store and a Brown
(operated, franchise, or plan) [3] store are located."
The District Court rejected the Government's contention that the combining of the manufacturing facilities of
Brown and Kinney would substantially lessen competition in the production of men's, women's, or children's
shoes for the national wholesale market. However, the
District Court did find that the likely foreclosure of other
manufacturers from the market represented by Kinney's
retail outlets may substantially lessen competition in the
manufacturers' distribution of "men's," "women's," and
"children's" shoes, considered separately, throughout the
Nation. The District Court also found that the merger
may substantially lessen competition in retailing alone in
"men's," "women's," and "children's" shoes, considered
separately, in every city of 10,000 or more population and
its immediate surrounding area in which both a Kinney
and a Brown store are located.
Brown's contentions here differ only slightly from those
made before the District Court. In order fully to understand and appraise these assertions, it is necessary to set

out in some detail the District Court's findings concerning the nature of the shoe industry and the place of Brown
and Kinney within that industry.
The Industry.
The District Court found that although domestic shoe
production was scattered among a large number of manufacturers, a small number of large companies occupied a
commanding position. Thus, while the 24 largest manufacturers produced about 35% of the Nation's shoes, the
top 4-International, Endicott-Johnson, Brown (including Kinney) and General Shoe-alone produced approximately 23% of the Nation's shoes or 65% of the production of the top 24.
In 1955, domestic production of nonrubber shoes was
509.2 million pairs, of which about 103.6 million pairs were
men's shoes, about 271 million pairs were women's shoes,
and about 134.6 million pairs were children's shoes.! The
District Court found that men's, women's, and children's
shoes are normally produced in separate factories.
The public buys these shoes through about 70,000 retail
outlets, only 22,000 of which, however, derive 50% or
more of their gross receipts from the sale of shoes and are
classified as "shoe stores" by the Census Bureau.' These
4 U. S. Bureau of Census, Facts for Industry, Production, by Kind
of Footwear: 1956 and 1955, Table 1, Production Series M31A-06,
introduced as Defendant's Exhibit MM. The term "nonrubber
shoes" includes leather shoes, sandals and play shoes, but excludes
canvas-upper, rubber-soled shoes, athletic shoes and slippers. Ibid.
5 These figures are based on the 1954 Census of Business. For that
enumeration, the Census Bureau classification "shoe stores" included
separately operated leased shoe departments of general stores, as distinguished from the shoe departments of general stores operated only
as sections of the latter's general business. U. S. Bureau of Census,
Retail Trade, Single Units and Multiunits, BC58-RS3, p. I. As
described, infra, Brown operated numerous leased shoe departments
in general stores which would be included in the Census Bureau's
total of "shoe stores."

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
294

301

Opinion of the Court.

22,000 shoe stores were found generally to sell (1) men's
shoes only, (2) women's shoes only, (3) women's and children's shoes, or (4) men's, women's, and children's shoes.
The District Court found a "definite trend" among shoe
manufacturers to acquire retail outlets. For example,
International Shoe Company had no retail outlets in 1945,
but by 1956 had acquired 130; General Shoe Company
had only 80 retail outlets in 1945 but had 526 by 1956;
Shoe Corporation of America, in the same period,
increased its retail holdings from 301 to 842; Melville
Shoe Company from 536 to 947; and Endicott-Johnson
from 488 to 540. Brown, itself, with no retail outlets of
its own prior to 1951, had acquired 845 such outlets by
1956. Moreover, between 1950 and 1956 nine independent shoe store chains, operating 1,114 retail shoe stores,
were found to have become subsidiaries of these large
firms and to have ceased their independent operations.
And once the manufacturers acquired retail outlets, the
District Court found there was a "definite trend" for the
parent-manufacturers to supply an ever increasing percentage of the retail outlets' needs, thereby foreclosing
other manufacturers from effectively competing for the
retail accounts. Manufacturer-dominated stores were
found to be "drying up" the available outlets for independent producers.
Another "definite trend" found to exist in the shoe
industry was a decrease in the number of plants manufacturing shoes. And there appears to have been a concomitant decrease in the number of firms manufacturing
shoes. In 1947, there were 1,077 independent manufacturers of shoes, but by 1954 their number had decreased
about 10% to 970.'
6 U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1958 Census of Manufacturers, MC
58(2)-31A--6. By 1958, the number of independent manufacturers
had decreased by another 10% to 872. Ibid.

Brown Shoe.
Brown Shoe was found not only to have been a participant, but also a moving factor, in these industry
trends. Although Brown had experimented several times
with operating its own retail outlets, by 1945 it had disposed of them all. However, in 1951, Brown again began
to seek retail outlets by acquiring the Nation's largest
operator of leased shoe departments, Wohl Shoe Company
(Wohl), which operated 250 shoe departments in department stores throughout the United States. Between 1952
and 1955 Brown made a number of smaller acquisitions:
Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Company (three retail stores),
Barnes & Company (two stores), Reilly Shoe Company
(two leased shoe departments), Richardson Shoe Store
(one store), and Wohl Shoe Company of Dallas (not connected with Wohl) (leased shoe departments in Dallas).
In 1954, Brown made another major acquisition: Regal
Shoe Corporation which, at the time, operated one manufacturing plant producing men's shoes and 110 retail
outlets.
The acquisition of these corporations was found to lead
to increased sales by Brown to the acquired companies.
Thus although prior to Brown's acquisition of Wohl in
1951, Wohl bought from Brown only 12.8% of its total
purchases of shoes, it subsequently increased its purchases to 21.4% in 1952 and to 32.6% in 1955. WetherbyKayser's purchases from Brown increased from 10.4%
before acquisition to over 50% after. Regal, which had
previously sold no shoes to Wohl and shoes worth only
$89,000 to Brown, in 1956 sold shoes worth $265,000 to
Wohl and $744,000 to Brown.
During the same period of time, Brown also acquired
the stock or assets of seven companies engaged solely in
shoe manufacturing. As a result, in 1955, Brown was the

Opinion of the Court.

fourth largest shoe manufacturer in the country, producing about 25.6 million pairs of shoes or about 4% of the
Nation's total footwear production.
Kinney.
Kinney is principally engaged in operating the largest
family-style shoe store chain in the United States. At the
time of trial, Kinney was found to be operating over 400
such stores in more than 270 cities. These stores were
found to make about 1.2% of all national retail shoe sales
by dollar volume. Moreover, in 1955 the Kinney stores
sold approximately 8 million pairs of nonrubber shoes
or about 1.6% of the national pairage sales of such shoes.
Of these sales, approximately 1.1 million pairs were of
men's shoes or about 1% of the national pairage sales of
men's shoes; approximately 4.2 million pairs were of
women's shoes or about 1.5% of the national pairage sales
of women's shoes; and approximately 2.7 million pairs
were of children's shoes or about 2% of the national pairage sales of children's shoes.'
In addition to this extensive retail activity, Kinney
owned and operated four plants which manufactured
men's, women's, and children's shoes and whose combined
output was 0.5% of the national shoe production in 1955,
making Kinney the twelfth largest shoe manufacturer in
the IUnited States.
Kinney stores were found to obtain about 20% of their
shoes from Kinney's own manufacturing plants. At the
time of the merger, Kinney bought no shoes from Brown;
7 Kinney's pairage sales of men's, women's, and children's shoes were
extracted from exhibits submitted to the Government in response to
its interrogatories. See GX 6, R. 48-53. These statistics are virtually identical to those cited in appellant's brief, with but one
exception. In its internal operations, appellant classifies certain shoes
as "growing girls'" shoes while the cited figures follow the Census
Bureau's treatment of such shoes as "women's" shoes.

however, in line with Brown's conceded reasons8 for
acquiring Kinney, Brown had, by 1957, become the largest
outside supplier of Kinney's shoes, supplying 7.9% of all
Kinney's needs.
It is in this setting that the merger was considered
and held to violate § 7 of the Clayton Act. The District
Court ordered Brown to divest itself completely of all
stock, share capital, assets or other interests it held in
Kinney, to operate Kinney to the greatest degree possible
as an independent concern pending complete divestiture,
to refrain thereafter from acquiring or having any interest
in Kinney's business or assets, and to file with the court
within 90 days a plan for carrying into effect the divestiture decreed. The District Court also stated it would
retain jurisdiction over the cause to enable the parties
to apply for such further relief as might be necessary to
enforce and apply the judgment. Prior to its submission
of a divestiture plan, Brown filed a notice of appeal in
the District Court. It then filed a jurisdictional statement in this Court, seeking review of the judgment below
as entered.
II.
JURISDICTION.

Appellant's jurisdictional statement cites as the basis
of our jurisdiction over this appeal § 2 of the Expediting
8As stated in the testimony of Clark R. Gamble, President of Brown
Shoe Company:
"It was our feeling, in addition to getting a distribution into the
field of prices which we were not covering, it was also the feeling that
as Kinney moved into the shopping centers in these free standing
stores, they were going into a higher income neighborhood and they
would probably find the necessity of u-grading and adding additional
lines to their very successful operation that they had been doing and
it would give us an opportunity we hoped to be able to sell them in
that category. Besides that, it was a very successful operation and
would give us a good diversified investment to stabilize our earnings."

Opinion of the Court.

Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15
U. S. C. § 29. In a civil antitrust action in which the
United States is the complainant that Act provides for
a direct appeal to this Court from "the final judgment of
the district court." I (Emphasis supplied.) The Government does not contest appellant's claim of jurisdiction;
on the contrary, it moved to have the judgment below
summarily affirmed, conceding our present jurisdiction to
review the merits of that judgment. We deferred ruling
on the Government's motion for summary affirmance and
noted probable jurisdiction over the appeal. 363 U. S.
825.10

It was suggested from the bench during the oral argument that, since the judgment of the District Court does
not include a specific plan for the dissolution of the
Brown-Kinney merger, but reserves such a ruling pending
the filing of suggested plans for implementing divestiture,
the judgment below is not "final" as contemplated by the
Expediting Act. In response to that suggestion, both
parties have filed briefs contending that we do have jurisdiction to dispose of the case on the merits in its present
posture. However, the mere consent of the parties to the
Court's consideration and decision of the case cannot, by
itself, confer jurisdiction on the Court. See American
Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S.6, 17-18; People's
Bank v. Calhoun, 102 U. S. 256, 260-261; Capron v.
Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126, 127. Therefore, a review of
the sources of the Court's jurisdiction is a threshold
9Congress thus limited the right of review in such cases to an appeal
from a decree which disposed of all matters, and it precluded the
possibility of an appeal either to this Court or to a Court of Appeals
from an interlocutory decree. United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, 279 U. S. 553, 558.

After probable jurisdiction had been noted, a joint motion of the

United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159.
The requirement that a final judgment shall have
been entered in a case by a lower court before a right of
appeal attaches has an ancient history in federal practice,
first appearing in the Judiciary Act of 1789."1 With occasional modifications, the requirement has remained a
cornerstone of the structure of appeals in the federal
courts.12 The Court has adopted essentially practical
tests for identifying those judgments which are, and those
which are not, to be considered "final." See, e. g., Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 326; Market Street
R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, 324 U. S. 548, 552; Republic
Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, 334 U. S. 62, 69; Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546;
DiBella v. United States, 369 U. S. 121, 124, 129; cf. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator
Co., 344 U. S. 206, 212; United States v. Schaefer Brewing Co., 356 U. S. 227, 232. A pragmatic approach to the
question of finality has been considered essential to the
achievement of the "just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action": 13 the touchstones of federal
procedure.
In most cases in which the Expediting Act has been
cited as the basis of this Court's jurisdiction, the issue of
"finality" has not been raised or discussed by the parties
or the Court. On but few occasions have particular

We think the decree of the District Court in this case
had sufficient indicia of finality for us to hold that the
judgment is properly appealable at this time. We note,
first, that the District Court disposed of the entire complaint filed by the Government. Every prayer for relief
was passed upon. Full divestiture by Brown of Kinney's
stock and assets was expressly required. Appellant was
permanently enjoined from acquiring or having any further interest in the business, stock or assets of the other
defendant in the suit. The single provision of the judgment by which its finality may be questioned is the one
requiring appellant to propose in the immediate future a
plan for carrying into effect the court's order of divestiture.
However, when we reach the merits of, and affirm, the
judgment below, the sole remaining task for the District
Court will be its acceptance of a plan for full divestiture,
and the supervision of the plan so accepted. Further rulings of the District Court in administering its decree,
facilitated by the fact that the defendants below have
been required to maintain separate books pendente lite,
are sufficiently independent of, and subordinate to, the
issues presented by this appeal to make the case in its
present posture a proper one for review now. 5 Appellant
here does not attack the full divestiture ordered by the
District Court as such; it is appellant's contention that

Louisiana, 233 U. S. 362; Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S.
120; Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541. The
details of the divestiture which the District Court will approve cannot
affect the outcome of the basic litigation in this case, as the details of
an eminent domain settlement might moot the claims of the condemnee
in that type of suit. See Republic Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, 334

Opinion of the Court.

under the facts of the case, as alleged and proved by the
Government, no order of divestiture could have been
proper. The propriety of divestiture was considered
below and is disputed here on an "all or nothing"
basis. It is ripe for review now, and will, thereafter, be
foreclosed. Repetitive judicial consideration of the same
question in a single suit will not occur here. Cf. Radio
Station WOW v. Johnson, supra, at 127; Catlin v. United
States, 324 U. S. 229, 233-234; Cobbledick v. United
States, supra, at 325, 330.
A second consideration supporting our view is the character of the decree still to be entered in this suit. It will
be an order of full divestiture. Such an order requires
careful, and often extended, negotiation and formulation.
This process does not take place in a vacuum, but, rather,
in a changing market place, in which buyers and bankers
must be found to accomplish the order of forced sale.
The unsettling influence of uncertainty as to the affirmance of the initial, underlying decision compelling divestiture would only make still more difficult the task of assuring expeditious enforcement of the antitrust laws. The
delay in withholding review of any of the issues in the
case until the details of a divestiture had been approved
by the District Court and reviewed here could well mean
a change in market conditions sufficiently pronounced to
render impractical or otherwise unenforceable the very
plan of asset disposition for which the litigation was held.
The public interest, as well as that of the parties, would
lose by such procedure.
Lastly, holding the decree of the District Court in the
instant case less than "final" and, thus, not appealable,
would require a departure from a settled course of the
Court's practice. It has consistently reviewed antitrust
decrees contemplating either future divestiture or other
comparable remedial action prior to the formulation and

entry of the precise details of the relief ordered. No
instance has been found in which the Court has reviewed
a case following a divestiture decree such as the one we
are asked to consider here, in which the party subject to
that decree has later brought the case back to this Court
with claims of error in the details of the divestiture finally
approved."
And only two years ago, we were unanimous
in accepting jurisdiction, and in affirming the judgment of
a District Court similar to the one entered here, in the only
case under amended § 7 of the Clayton Act brought before
us at a juncture comparable to the instant litigation.
See Maryland& VirginiaMilk ProducersAssn. v. United
States, 362 U. S. 458, 472-473.17 A fear of piecemeal appeals because of our adherence to existing procedure can
find no support in history. Thus, the substantial body
16 The Court has, of course, occasionally reviewed varying facets
of single antitrust cases on separate appeals. However, such cases
are distinguishable from the situation at bar. Thus, one group
includes cases in which the Government first sought appellate review
from dismissals of its complaints, whereafter the Court considered the
orders entered on remand. E. g., United States v. Terminal R. Assn.
of St. Louis, 224 U. S. 383; 236 U. S. 194; United States v. E. I.
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U. S. 586; 366 U. S. 316. Another
group includes cases in which the Government appealed from what
it considered to be inadequate decrees, in which the Court later considered the further relief ordered on remand. E. g., United States
v. Reading Co., 253 U. S. 26, later considered sub nom. Continental
Insurance Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 156; United States v. Paramount Pictures,334 U. S. 131, later considered sub nom. Loew's, Inc.,
v. United States, 339 U. S. 974. And appeals in which the details of a
divestiture were made a primary issue have followed the entry of such
orders upon the filing of consent decrees, in which the underlying
requirements of divestiture were never previously presented. E. g.,
Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 311; United States v. Swift &
Co., 286 U. S. 106; Chrysler Corp. v. United States, 316 U. S. 556;

III.
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.

This case is one of the first to come before us in which
the Government's complaint is based upon allegations
that the appellant has violated § 7 of the Clayton Act,
as that section was amended in 1950.18 The amendments
adopted in 1950 culminated extensive efforts over a number of years, on the parts of both the Federal Trade Commission and some members of Congress, to secure revision
of a section of the antitrust laws considered by many
observers to be ineffective in its then existing form. Sixteen bills to amend § 7 during the period 1943 to 1949
18Matrial in italics was added by the amendments; material in
brackets was deleted. "No corporation engaged in commerce shall
acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or
other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part
of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where
in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of
such acquisition may be [to] substantially to lessen competition
[between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any
section or community], or to tend to create a monopoly [of any line
of commerce]." Other paragraphs of § 7 were also anended in details
not relevant to this case. The only other cases to reach this Court,
in which the Government's complaints were based, in part, on
amended § 7, were Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v.
United States, 362 U. S. 458, and Jerrold Electronics Corp. v. United
States, 365 U. S. 567. However, a detailed analysis of the scope and
purposes of the 1950 amendments was unnecessary to our disposition
of the issues raised in those cases.

alone were introduced for consideration by the Congress,
and full public hearings on proposed amendments were
held in three separate sessions." In the light of this
extensive legislative attention to the measure, and the
broad, general language finally selected by Congress for
the expression of its will, we think it appropriate to
review the history of the amended Act in determining
whether the judgment of the court below was consistent
with the intent of the legislature. See United States v.

did not, by its explicit terms, or as construed by this
Court, bar the acquisition by one corporation of the
assets of another. 20 Nor did it appear to preclude the
acquisition of stock in any corporation other than a
direct competitor. 2 Although proponents of the 1950

tant to an Act then conceived to be directed primarily at
the development of holding companies and at the secret
acquisition of competitors through the purchase of all or
parts of such competitors' stock.2"
It was, however, not long before the Federal Trade
Commission recognized deficiencies in the Act as first
enacted. Its Annual Reports frequently suggested
amendments, principally along two lines: first, to "plug
the loophole" exempting asset acquisitions from coverage
under the Act, and second, to require companies proposing a merger to give the Commission prior notification
of their plans.2" The Final Report of the Temporary
National Economic Committee also recommended changes
focusing on these two proposals.2" Hearings were held on
some bills incorporating either or both of these changes
but, prior to the amendments adopted in 1950, none
reached the floor of Congress for plenary consideration.

§ 7 Was confined to embracing within the Act's terms the

acquisition of assets as well as stock, in the course of the
hearings conducted in both the Eightieth and Eighty-first
Congresses, a more far-reaching examination of the purposes and provisions of § 7 was undertaken. A review of
the legislative history of these amendments provides no
unmistakably clear indication of the precise standards
the Congress wished the Federal Trade Commission and
the courts to apply in judging the legality of particular
mergers. However, sufficient expressions of a consistent
point of view may be found in the hearings, committee
reports of both the House and Senate and in floor debate
to provide those charged with enforcing the Act with a
usable frame of reference within which to evaluate any
given merger.
The dominant theme pervading congressional consideration of the 1950 amendments was a fear of what was
considered to be a rising tide of economic concentration
in the American economy. Apprehension in this regard
was bolstered by the publication in 1948 of the Federal
Trade Commission's study on corporate mergers. Statistics from this and other current studies were cited as
evidence of the danger to the American economy in unchecked corporate expansions through mergers.27 Other
considerations cited in support of the bill were the desirF. T. C., The Present Trend of Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions, reprinted in Hearings on H. R. 515, at 300-317; F. T. C., The
Merger Movement: A Summary Report, passim; 95 Cong. Rec.

81st Cong., 2d Sess. 3. The House Report on the amendments
summarized its view of the situation:
"That the current merger movement [during the years 1940-1947]
has had a significant effect on the economy is clearly revealed by the
fact that the asset value of the companies which have disappeared
through mergers amounts to 5.2 billion dollars, or no less than 5.5
percent of the total assets of all manufacturing corporations--a significant segment of the economy to be swallowed up in such a short
period of time." H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 3.

ability of retaining "local control" over industry and
the protection of small businesses."8 Throughout the
recorded discussion may be found examples of Congress'
fear not only of accelerated concentration of economic
power on economic grounds, but also of the threat to other
values a trend toward concentration was thought to pose.
What were some of the factors, relevant to a judgment
as to the validity of a given merger, specifically discussed

by Congress in redrafting § 7?
First, there is no doubt that Congress did wish to "plug
the loophole" and to include within the coverage of the
Act the acquisition of assets no less than the acquisition
of stock.29
28 See, e. g., 95 Cong. Rec. 11486, 11489, 11494-11495, 11498; 96
Cong. Rec. 16444, 16448, 16450, 16452, 16503 (remarks by the cosponsors of the amendments, Representative Celler and Senator Kefauver,
and by Representatives Bryson, Keating and Patman and Senators
Murray and Aiken). Cf. United States v. Aluminum Co. of America,
148 F. 2d 416, 429 (C. A. 2d Cir., per Learned Hand, J.): "Throughout the history of these [antitrust] statutes it has been constantly
assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve,
for its own sake and in spite of possible cost, an organization of
industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other."
29 Virtually every member of Congress who spoke in support of
the amendments, indicated that this aspect of the legislation was its
salient c-haracteristic. Representative Kefauver, one of the Act's
sponsors, testified, "The bill is not complicated. It proposes simply
to plug the loophole in sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act." Hearings on H. R. 515, at 4. The Senate Report on the measure finally
adopted summarized the "Purpose" of the amendment with this
single paragraph:
"The purpose of the proposed legislation is to prevent corporations
from acquiring another corporation by means of the acquisition of its
assets, whereunder [sic] the present law it is prohibited from acquiring the stock of said corporation. Since the acquisition of stock is
significant chiefly because it is likely to result in control of the underlying assets, failure to prohibit direct purchase of the same assets has
been inconsistent and paradoxical as to the over-all effect of existing
law." S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2.

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES. 317

Opinion of the Court.

Second, by the deletion of the "acquiring-acquired"
language in the original text,"° it hoped to make plain that
§ 7 applied not only to mergers between actual competitors, but also to vertical and conglomerate mergers whose
effect may tend to lessen competition in any line of
commerce in any section of the country.31
Third, it is apparent that a keystone in the erection of
a barrier to what Congress saw was the rising tide of
economic concentration, was its provision of authority for
arresting mergers at a time when the trend to a lessening
of competition in a line of commerce was still in its incipiency. Congress saw the process of concentration in
American business as a dynamic force; it sought to assure
the Federal Trade Commission and the courts the power
80 The deletion of the "acquiring-acquired" test was the direct
result of an amendment offered by the Federal Trade Commission. In
presenting the proposed change, Commission Counsel Kelley made the
following points: this Court's decisions had implied that the effect on
competition between the parties to the merger was not the only test
of the illegality of a stock merger; the Court had applied Sherman Act
tests to Clayton Act cases and thus judged the effect of a merger on
the industry as a whole; this incorporation of Sherman Act tests, with
the accompanying "rule of reason," was inadequate for reaching some
mergers which the Commission felt were not in the public interest;
and the new amendment proposed a middle ground between what
appeared to be an overly restrictive test insofar as mergers between
competitors were concerned, and what appeared to the Commission
to be an overly lenient test insofar as all other mergers were concerned. Congressman Kefauver supported this amendment and the
Commission's proposal was then incorporated into the bill which was
eventually adopted by the Congress. See Hearings on H. R. 515, at
23, 117-119, 238-240, 259; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee on H. R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.
(hereinafter cited as S. Hearings on H. R. 2734) 147.
31 That § 7 was intended to apply to all mergers-horizontal, vertical or conglomerate-was specifically reiterated by the House Report
on the final bill. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 11. And

to brake this force at its outset and before it gathered
momentum. 2
Fourth, and closely related to the third, Congress
rejected, as inappropriate to the problem it sought to
remedy, the application to §7 cases of the standards for
judging the legality of business combinations adopted by
the courts in dealing with cases arising under the Sherman
Act, and which may have been applied to some early cases
arising under original § 7.33
32 That § 7 of the Clayton Act was intended to reach incipient
monopolies and trade restraints outside the scope of the Sherman
Act was explicitly stated in the Senate Report on the original Act.
S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 1. See United States v. E. I.
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U. S. 586, 589. This theme was
reiterated in congressional consideration of the amendments adopted
in 1950, and found expression in the final House and Senate Reports
on the measure. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8
("Acquisitions of stock or assets have a cumulative effect, and control
of the market . . . may be achieved not in a single acquisition but as
the result of a series of acquisitions. The bill is intended to permit
intervention in such a cumulative process when the effect of an
acquisition may be a significant reduction in the vigor of competition."); S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 ("The intent
here . . . is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency
and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a
Sherman Act proceeding."). And see F. T. C., The Merger Movement: A Summary Report 6-7.
" The Report of the House Judiciary Committee on H. R. 515
recommended the adoption of tests more stringent than those in the
Sherman Act. H. R. Rep. No. 596, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 7. A
vigorous minority thought no new legislation was needed. Id., at

subsequent consideration of H. R. 2734, this Court had decided
United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U. S. 495, which some
understood to indicate that existing law might be inadequate to
prevent mergers that had substantially lessened competition in a
section of the country, but which, nevertheless, had not risen to the
level of those restraints of trade or monopoly prohibited by the Sherman Act. See 96 Cong. Rec. 16502 (remarks of Senator Kefauver);

Opinion of the Court.

Fifth, at the same time that it sought to create an effective tool for preventing all mergers having demonstrable
anticompetitive effects, Congress recognized the stimulation to competition that might flow from particular
mergers. When concern as to the Act's breadth was
expressed, supporters of the amendments indicated that it
would not impede, for example, a merger between two
small companies to enable the combination to compete
more effectively with larger corporations dominating the
relevant market, nor a merger between a corporation
which is financially healthy and a failing one which no
longer can be a vital competitive factor in the market."'
H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 10-11. Numerous other
statements by Congressmen and Senators and by representatives of
the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and the
President's Council of Economic Adyisors were made to the Congress
suggesting that a standard of illegality stricter than that imposed by
the Sherman Act was needed. See, e. g., H. R. Hearings on H. R.
2734, at 13, 29, 41, 117; S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 22, 23, 47, 66,
319. The House Judiciary Committee's 1949 Report supported this
concept unanimously although five of the nine members who had dissented two years earlier in H. R. Rep. No. 596 were still serving on
the Committee. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 7-8. The
Senate Report was explicit: "The committee wish to make it clear that
the bill is not intended to revert to the Sherman Act test. The intent
here .. .is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency
and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a
Sherman Act proceeding ....
[The] various additions and deletions-some strengthening and others weakening the bill-are not conflicting in purpose and effect. They merely are different steps toward
the same objective, namely, that of framing a bill which, though
dropping portions of the so-called Clayton Act test that have no
economic significance [the reference would appear to be primarily to
the "acquiring-acquired" standard of the original Act], reaches far
beyond the Sherman Act." S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5.

The deletion of the word "community" in the original
Act's description of the relevant geographic market is
another illustration of Congress' desire to indicate that
its concern was with the adverse effects of a given
merger on competition only in an economically significant "section" of the country. 5 Taken as a whole, the
legislative history illuminates congressional concern with
the protection of competition, not competitors, and its
desire to restrain mergers only to the extent that such
combinations may tend to lessen competition.
Sixth, Congress neither adopted nor rejected specifically any particular tests for measuring the relevant markets, either as defined in terms of product or in terms of
geographic locus of competition, within which the anti1st Sess. 6-8; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4. As to mergers

3r, The Federal Trade Commission's amendment, see note 30, supra,
included the phrase "where . . . in any section, community, or trade
area, there is reasonable probability that the effect of such acquisition
may be to substantially lessen competition." Congressman Kefauver
urged deletion of the word "community" on the ground that it might
suggest, for example, that a merger between two small filling stations
in a section of a city was proscribed. Hearings on H. R. 515, at 260.
And see also 96 Cong. Rec. 16453. The fear of literal prohibition of
all but de minimis mergers through the use of the word "community"
was also cited by the Senate Report as the basis for its retention
solely of the word "section." S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4.
The reference to "trade area" was deleted as redundant, when it
became clear that the "section" of the country to which the Act was to
apply, referred not to a definite geographic area of the country, but
rather the geographic area of effective competition in the relevant line
of commerce. See S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 38-52, 66-84, 101102, 132, 133, 144, 145; H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8;

competitive effects of a merger were to be judged. Nor
did it adopt a definition of the word "substantially,"
whether in quantitative terms of sales or assets or market
shares or in designated qualitative terms, by which a
merger's effects on competition were to be measured."
Seventh, while providing no definite quantitative or
qualitative tests by which enforcement agencies could
gauge the effects of a given merger to determine whether
it may "substantially" lessen competition or tend toward
monopoly, Congress indicated plainly that a merger had
to be functionally viewed, in the context of its particular
The House Report on H. R. 2734 stated that two tests of
illegality were included in the proposed Act: whether the merger
substantially lessened competition or tended to create a monopoly.
It stated that such effects could be perceived through findings, for
example, that a whole or material part of the competitive activity of
an enterprise, which had been a substantial factor in competition, had
been eliminated; that the relative size of the acquiring corporation
had increased to such a point that its advantage over competitors
threatened to be "decisive"; that an "undue" number of competing
enterprises had been eliminated; or that buyers and sellers in the relevant market had established relationships depriving their rivals of
a fair opportunity to compete. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong.,
1st Sess. 8. Each of these standards, couched in general language,
reflects a conscious avoidance of exclusively mathematical tests even
though the case of Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States,
337 U. S. 293, said to have created a "quantitative substantiality"
test for suits arising under § 3 of the Clayton Act, was decided while
Congress was considering H. R. 2734. Some discussion of the applicability of this test to § 7 cases ensued, see, e. g., S. Hearings on H. R.
2734, at 31-32, 169-172; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 21;
96 Cong. Rec. 16443, but this aspect of the Standard Oil decision was
neither specifically endorsed nor impugned by the bill's supporters.
However, the House Judiciary Committee's Report, issued two months
after Standard Oil had been decided, remarked that the tests of
illegality under the new Act were intended to be "similar to those
which the courts have applied in interpreting the same language as
used in other sections of the Clayton Act." H. R. Rep. No. 1191,

industry. 3' That is, whether the consolidation was to
take place in an industry that was fragmented rather than
concentrated, that had seen a recent trend toward domination by a few leaders or had remained fairly consistent
in its distribution of market shares among the participating companies, that had experienced easy access to markets by suppliers and easy access to suppliers by buyers
or had witnessed foreclosure of business, that had witnessed the ready entry of new competition or the erection
of barriers to prospective entrants, all were aspects, varying in importance with the merger under consideration,
which would properly be taken into account. 8
37 A number of the supporters of the amendments voiced their concern that passage of the bill would amount to locking the barn door
after most of the horses had been stolen, but urged approval of the
measure to prevent the theft of those still in the barn. Which was
to say that, if particular industries had not yet been subject to the
congressionally perceived trend toward concentration, adoption of
the amendments was urged as a way of preventing the trend from
reaching those industries as yet unaffected. See, e. g.. 95 Cong. Rec.
11489, 11494, 11498 (remarks of Representatives Keating, Yates,
Patman); 96 Cong. Rec. 16444 (remarks of Senators O'Mahoney,
Murray).
31Subsequent to the adoption of the 1950 amendments, both the
Federal Trade Commission and the courts have, in the light of Congress' expressed intent, recognized the relevance and importance of
economic data that places any given merger under consideration
within an industry framework almost inevitably unique in every case.
Statistics reflecting the shares of the market controlled by the industry leaders and the parties to the merger are, of course, the primary
index of market power; but only a further examination of the particular market-its structure, history and probable future-can provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive
effect of the merger. See, e. g., Pillsbury Mills, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 555;
United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576 (D. C.
S. D. N. Y.); United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp.

Opinion of the Court.

Eighth, Congress used the words "may be substantially to lessen competition" (emphasis supplied), to
indicate that its concern was with probabilities, not
certainties." Statutes existed for dealing with clear-cut
menaces to competition; no statute was sought for dealing with ephemeral possibilities. Mergers with a probable anticompetitive effect were to be proscribed by this
Act.
It is against this background that we return to the case
before us.
IV.
THE VERTICAL ASPECTS OF THE MERGER.

Economic arrangements between companies standing
in a supplier-customer relationship are characterized as
"vertical." The primary vice of a vertical merger or
other arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that,
31In the course of both the Committee hearings and floor debate,
attention was occasionally focused on the issue of whether "possible,"
"probable" or "certain" anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger
would have to be proven to establish a violation of the Act. Language
was quoted from prior decisions of the Court in antitrust cases in
which each of these interpretations of the word "may" was suggested as appropriate. H. R. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 74; S.
Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 32, 33, 160-168; 96 Cong. Rec. 16453,
16502. The final Senate Report on the question was explicit on the
point:
"The use of these words ["may be"] means that the bill, if enacted,
would not apply to the mere possibility but only to the reasonable
probability of the prescribed [sic] effect . . . . The words 'may
be' have been in section 7 of the Clayton Act since 1914. The
concept of reasonable probability conveyed by these words is a necessary element in any statute which seeks to arrest restraints of trade
in their incipiency and before they develop into full-fledged restraints
violative of the Sherman Act. A requirement of certainty and
actuality of injury to competition is incompatible with any effort to
supplement the Sherman Act by reaching incipient restraints." S.
Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 6. See also 51 Cong. Rec. 14464
(remarks of Senator Reed).

by foreclosing the competitors of either party from a segment of the market otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a "clog on competition," Standard Oil
Co. of California v. United States, 337 U. S. 293, 314,
which "deprive [s] . .. rivals of a fair opportunity to compete." 40 H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8.
Every extended vertical arrangement by its very nature,
for at least a time, denies to competitors of the supplier
the opportunity to compete for part or all of the trade of
the customer-party to the vertical arrangement. However, the Clayton Act does not render unlawful all such
vertical arrangements, but forbids only those whose effect
"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to
create a monopoly" "in any line of commerce in any section of the country." Thus, as we have previously noted,
"[d]etermination of the relevant market is a necessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the
Clayton Act because the threatened monopoly must
be one which will substantially lessen competition
'within the area of effective competition.' Substantiality can be determined only in terms of the market
affected." "1
The "area of effective competition" must be determined
by reference to a product market (the "line of commerce")
and a geographic market (the "section of the country").
40

In addition, a vertical merger may disrupt and injure competi-

tion when those independent customers of the supplier who are in
competition with the merging customer, are forced either to stop
handling the supplier's lines, thereby jeopardizing the goodwill they
have developed, or to retain the supplier's lines, thereby forcing them
into competition with their own supplier. See United States v.
Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 613 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.).

Opinion of the Court.

The Product Market.
The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the
cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and
substitutes for it."2 However, within this broad market,
well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves,
constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.
United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353
U. S.586, 593-595. The boundaries of such a submarket
may be determined by examining such practical indicia
as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a
separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct
customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and
specialized vendors. " Because § 7 of the Clayton Act
prohibits any merger which may substantially lessen competition "in any line of commerce" (emphasis supplied),
it is necessary to examine the effects of a merger in each
such economically significant submarket to determine if
there is a reasonable probability that the merger will
substantially lessen competition. If such a probability is
found to exist, the merger is proscribed."
42 The cross-elasticity of production facilities may also be an important factor in defining a product market within which a vertical
merger is to be viewed. Cf. United States v. Columbia Steel Co..
334 U. S. 495, 510-511; United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168
F. Supp. 576, 592 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.). However,'the District Court
made but limited findings concerning the feasibility of interchanging
equipment in the manufacture of nonrubber footwear. At the same
time, the record supports the court's conclusion that individual plants
generally produced shoes in only one of the product lines the court
found relevant.

2d 585, 603 (C. A. 3d Cir.); American Crystal Sugar Co. v. Cuban-

OCTOBER TERM, 1961.
Opinion of the Court.

370 U. S.

Applying these considerations to the present case, we
conclude that the record supports the District Court's
finding that the relevant lines of commerce are men's,
women's, and children's shoes. These product lines are
recognized by the public; each line is manufactured in
separate plants; each has characteristics peculiar to itself
rendering it generally noncompetitive with the others;
and each is, of course, directed toward a distinct class of
customers.
Appellant, however, contends that the District Court's
definitions fail to recognize sufficiently "price/quality"
and "age/sex" distinctions in shoes. Brown argues that
the predominantly medium-priced shoes which it manufactures occupy a product market different from the predominantly low-priced shoes which Kinney sells. But
agreement with that argument would be equivalent to
holding that medium-priced shoes do not compete with
low-priced shoes. We think the District Court properly
found the facts to be otherwise. It would be unrealistic
to accept Brown's contention that, for example, men's
shoes selling below $8.99 are in a different product market
from those selling above $9.00.
This is not to say, however, that "price/quality" differences, where they exist, are unimportant in analyzing a
merger; they may be of importance in determining the
likely effect of a merger. But the boundaries of the relevant market must be drawn with sufficient breadth to
include the competing products of each of the merging
companies and to recognize competition where, in fact,
competition exists. Thus we agree with the District
Court that in this case a further division of product
lines based on "price/quality" differences would be
"unrealistic."

N. Y.). See also note 39, supra.

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
294

327

Opinion of the Court.

Brown's contention that the District Court's product
market definitions should have recognized further
"age/sex" distinctions raises a different problem. Brown's
sharpest criticism is directed at the District Court's finding that children's shoes constituted a single line of commerce. Brown argues, for example, that "a little boy
does not wear a little girl's black patent leather pump"
and that "[a] male baby cannot wear a growing boy's
shoes." Thus Brown argues that "infants' and babies' "
shoes, "misses' and children's" shoes and "youths' and
boys' " shoes should each have been considered a separate
line of commerce. Assuming, arguendo, that little boys'
shoes, for example, do have sufficient peculiar characteristics to constitute one of the markets to be used in
analyzing the effects of this merger, we do not think that
in this case the District Court was required to employ
finer "age/sex" distinctions than those recognized by its
classifications of "men's," "women's," and "children's"
shoes. Further division does not aid us in analyzing the
effects of this merger. Brown manufactures about the
same percentage of the Nation's children's shoes (5.8%)
as it does of the Nation's youths' and boys' shoes (6.5%),
of the Nation's misses' and children's shoes (6.0%) and of
the Nation's infants' and babies' shoes (4.9%). Similarly,
Kinney sells about the same percentage of the Nation's
children's shoes (2%) as it does of the Nation's youths'
and boys' shoes (3.1%), of the Nation's misses' and children's shoes (1.9%), and of the Nation's infants' and
babies' shoes (1.5%). Appellant can point to no advantage it would enjoy were finer divisions than those chosen
by the District Court employed. Brown manufactures
significant, comparable quantities of virtually every type
of nonrubber men's, women's, and children's shoes, and
Kinney sells such quantities of virtually every type of
men's, women's, and children's shoes. Thus, whether
considered separately or together, the picture *of this

merger is the same. We, therefore, agree with the District
Court's conclusion that in the setting of this case to subdivide the shoe market further on the basis of "age/sex"
distinctions would be "impractical" and "unwarranted."
The Geographic Market.
We agree with the parties and the District Court that
insofar as the vertical aspect of this merger is concerned,
the relevant geographic market is the entire Nation. The
relationships of product value, bulk, weight and consumer
demand enable manufacturers to distribute their shoes
on a nationwide basis, as Brown and Kinney, in fact, do.
The anticompetitive effects of the merger are to be
measured within this range of distribution.
The Probable Effect of the Merger.
Once the area of effective competition affected by a
vertical arrangement has been defined, an analysis must
be made to determine if the effect of the arrangement.
"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to
create a monopoly" in this market.
Since the diminution of the vigor of competition which
may stem from a vertical arrangement results primarily
from a foreclosure of a share of the market otherwise open
to competitors, an important consideration in determining
whether the effect of a vertical arrangement "may be
substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create
a monopoly" is the size of the share of the market foreclosed. However, this factor will seldom be determinative. If the share of the market foreclosed is so large
that it approaches monopoly proportions, the Clayton
Act will, of course, have been violated; but the arrangement will also have run afoul of the Sherman Act. 45 And
the legislative history of § 7 indicates clearly that the

Opinion of the Court.

tests for measuring the legality of any particular economic
arrangement under the Clayton Act are to be less stringent
than those used in applying the Sherman Act." On the
other hand, foreclosure of a de minimis share of the
market will not tend "substantially to lessen competition."
Between these extremes, in cases such as the one before
us, in which the foreclosure is neither of monopoly nor
de minimis proportions, the percentage of the market
foreclosed by the vertical arrangement cannot itself be
decisive. In such cases, it becomes necessary to undertake an examination of various economic and historical
factors in order to determine whether the arrangement
under review is of the type Congress sought to proscribe.'
A most important such factor to examine is the very
nature and purpose of the arrangement." Congress not
only indicated that "the tests of illegality [under § 7]
are intended to be similar to those which the courts have
applied in interpreting the same language as used in other
sections of the Clayton Act," " but also chose for § 7
language virtually identical to that of § 3 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U. S. C. § 14, which had been interpreted by this
Court to require an examination of the interdependence
of the market share foreclosed by, and the economic purpose of, the vertical arrangement. Thus, for example, if
a particular vertical arrangement, considered under § 3,
appears to be a limited term exclusive-dealing contract,

the market foreclosure must generally be significantly
greater than if the arrangement is a tying contract before
the arrangement will be held to have violated the Act.
Compare Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365
U. S. 320, and Standard Oil Co. of California v. United
States, supra,with InternationalSalt Co. v. United States,
332 U. S. 392.0 The reason for this is readily discernible.
The usual tying contract forces the customer to take a
product or brand he does not necessarily want in order
to secure one which he does desire. Because such an
arrangement is inherently anticompetitive, we have held
that its use by an established company is likely "substantially to lessen competition" although only a relatively
small amount of commerce is affected. International
Salt Co. v. United States, supra. Thus, unless the tying
device is employed by a small company in an attempt to
break into a market, cf. Harley-DavidsonMotor Co., 50
F. T. C. 1047, 1066, the use of a tying device can rarely "
be harmonized with the strictures of the antitrust laws,
which are intended primarily to preserve and stimulate
competition. See StandardOil Co. of Californiav. United
States, supra, at 305-306. On the other hand, requirement contracts are frequently negotiated at the behest of
the customer who has chosen the particular supplier and
his product upon the basis of competitive merit. See,
e. g., Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., supra.
Of course, the fact that requirement contracts are not
inherently anticompetitive will not save a particular
agreement if, in fact, it is likely "substantially to lessen
competition, or to tend to create a monopoly." E. g.,
Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, supra.
Yet a requirement contract may escape censure if only a

small share of the market is involved, if the purpose of the
agreement is to insure to the customer a sufficient supply
of a commodity vital to the customer's trade or to insure
to the supplier a market for his output and if there is no
trend toward concentration in the industry. Tampa
Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., supra. Similar considerations are pertinent to a judgment under § 7 of the
Act.
The importance which Congress attached to economic
purpose is further demonstrated by the Senate and House
Reports on H. R. 2734, which evince an intention to
preserve the "failing company" doctrine of International
Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 280 U. S. 291.12 Similarly, Congress foresaw that the merger of two large
companies or a large and a small company might violate
the Clayton Act while the merger of two small companies
might not, although the share of the market foreclosed be
identical, if the purpose of the small companies is to
enable them in combination to compete with larger
corporations dominating the market. 3
The present merger involved neither small companies
nor failing companies. In 1955, the date of this merger,
Brown was the fourth largest manufacturer in the shoe
industry with sales of approximately 25 million pairs of
shoes and assets of over $72,000,000 while Kinney had
sales of about 8 million pairs of shoes and assets of about
$18,000,000. Not only was Brown one of the leading
manufacturers of men's, women's, and children's shoes,
but Kinney, with over 350 retail outlets, owned and operated the largest independent chain of family shoe stores
in the Nation. Thus, in this industry, no merger between

a manufacturer and an independent retailer could involve
a larger potential market foreclosure. Moreover, it is
apparent both from past behavior of Brown and from the
testimony of Brown's President,"4 that Brown would use
its ownership of Kinney to force Brown shoes into Kinney
stores. Thus, in operation this vertical arrangement
would be quite analogous to one involving a tying clause. 5
Another important factor to consider is the trend
toward concentration in the industry. 6 It is true, of
course, that the statute prohibits a given merger only if
the effect of that merger may be substantially to lessen
competition. 7 But the very wording of § 7 requires a
prognosis of the probable future effect of the merger. 8
The existence of a trend toward vertical integration,
which the District Court found, is well substantiated by
the record. Moreover, the court found a tendency of the
acquiring manufacturers to become increasingly important sources of supply for their acquired outlets. The
necessary corollary of these trends is the foreclosure of
independent manufacturers from markets otherwise open
to them. And because these trends are not the product
of accident but are rather the result of deliberate policies
of Brown and other leading shoe manufacturers, account
must be taken of these facts in order to predict the prob54

able future consequences of this merger. It is against this
background of continuing concentration that the present
merger must be viewed.
Brown argues, however, that the shoe industry is at
present composed of a large number of manufacturers and
retailers, and that the industry is dynamically competitive. But remaining vigor cannot immunize a merger if
the trend in that industry is toward oligopoly. See
Pillsbury Mills, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 555, 573. It is the probable effect of the merger upon the future as well as the
present which the Clayton Act commands the courts and
the Commission to examine."'
Moreover, as we have remarked above, not only must
we consider the probable effects of the merger upon the
economics of the particular markets affected but also we
must consider its probable effects upon the economic way
of life sought to be preserved by Congress.6
Congress
was desirous of preventing the formation of further
oligopolies with their attendant adverse effects upon local
control of industry and upon small business. Where an
industry was composed of numerous independent units,
Congress appeared anxious to preserve this structure.
The Senate Report, quoting with approval from the Federal Trade Commission's 1948 report on the merger movement, states explicitly that amended § 7 is addressed, inter
alia, to the following problem:
"Under the Sherman Act, an acquisition is unlawful if it creates a monopoly or constitutes an attempt
to monopolize. Imminent monopoly may appear
when one large concern acquires another, but it is
unlikely to be perceived in a small acquisition by a
large enterprise. As a large concern grows through
a series of such small acquisitions, its accretions of

power are individually so minute as to make it difficult to use the Sherman Act test against them ...
"Where several large enterprises are extending
their power by successive small acquisitions, the
cumulative effect of their purchases may be to convert an industry from one of intense competition
among many enterprises to one in which three or four
large concerns produce the entire supply." S. Rep.

Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8.
The District Court's findings, and the record facts,
many of them set forth in Part I of this opinion, convince
us that the shoe industry is being subjected to just
such a cumulative series of vertical mergers which, if
left unchecked, will be likely "substantially to lessen
competition."
We reach this conclusion because the trend toward vertical integration in the shoe industry, when combined with
Brown's avowed policy of forcing its own shoes upon its
retail subsidiaries, may foreclose competition from a substantial share of the markets for men's, women's, and
children's shoes, without producing any countervailing
competitive, economic, or social advantages.
V.
THE HORIZONTAL ASPECTS OF THE MERGER.

An economic arrangement between companies performing similar functions in the production or sale of comparable goods or services is characterized as "horizontal."
The effect on competition of such an arrangement
depends, of course, upon its character and scope. Thus,
its validity in the face of the antitrust laws will depend
upon such factors as: the relative size and number of the

Opinion of the Court.

parties to the arrangement; whether it allocates shares of
the market among the parties; whether it fixes prices at
which the parties will sell their product; or whether it
absorbs or insulates competitors. - Where the arrangement effects a horizontal merger between companies
occupying the same product and geographic market,
whatever competition previously may have existed in that
market between the parties to the merger is eliminated.
Section 7 of the Clayton Act, prior to its amendment,
focused upon this aspect of horizontal combinations by
proscribing acquisitions which might result in a lessening
of competition between the acquiring and the acquired
companies.6 3 The 1950 amendments made plain Congress' intent that the validity of such combinations was to
be gauged on a broader scale: their effect on competition
generally in an economically significant market.
Thus, again, the proper definition of the market is a
"necessary predicate" to an examination of the competition that may be affected by the horizontal aspects of the
merger. The acquisition of Kinney by Brown resulted
in a horizontal combination at both the manufacturing
and retailing levels of their businesses. Although the
District Court found that the merger of Brown's and
Kinney's manufacturing facilities was economically too
insignificant to come within the prohibitions of the Clayton Act, the Government has not appealed from this portion of the lower court's decision. Therefore, we have no
occasion to express our views with respect to that finding.
On the other hand, appellant does contest the District
Court's finding that the merger of the companies' retail
outlets may tend substantially to lessen competition.

Sugar Institute, Inc., v. United States, 297 U. S. 553; United States v.

Opinion of the Court.

370 U. S.

The Product Market.
Shoes are sold in the United States in retail shoe stores
and in shoe departments of general stores. These outlets
sell: (1) men's shoes, (2) women's shoes, (3) women's
or children's shoes, or (4) men's, women's or children's
shoes. Prior to the merger, both Brown and Kinney sold
their shoes in competition with one another through the
enumerated kinds of outlets characteristic of the industry.
In Part IV of this opinion we hold that the District
Court correctly defined men's, women's, and children's
shoes as the relevant lines of commerce in which to
analyze the vertical aspects of the merger. For the reasons there stated we also hold that the same lines of commerce are appropriate for considering the horizontal
aspects of the merger.
The Geographic Market.
The criteria to be used in determining the appropriate
geographic market are essentially similar to those used
to determine the relevant product market. See S. Rep.
No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6; United States v.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U. S. 586, 593.
Moreover, just as a product submarket may have § 7
significance as the proper "line of commerce," so may a
geographic submarket be considered the appropriate "section of the country." Erie Sand & Gravel Co. v. Federal
Trade Comm'n, 291 F. 2d 279, 283 (C. A. 3d Cir.); United
States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 595603 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.). Congress prescribed a pragmatic, factual approach to the definition of the relevant
market and not a formal, legalistic one. The geographic
market selected must, therefore, both "correspond to the
commercial realities" " of the industry and be economiAmerican Crystal Sugar Co. v. Cuban-American Sugar Co., 152

cally significant. Thus, although the geographic market
in some instances may encompass the entire Nation, under
other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area. United States v. Columbia Pictures Corp.,
189 F. Supp. 153, 193-194 (D. C. S. D. N. Y.); United
States v. Maryland & Virginia Milk ProducersAssn., 167
F. Supp. 799 (D. C. D. C.), affirmed, 362 U. S.458. The
fact that two merging firms have competed directly on
the horizontal level in but a fraction of the geographic
markets in which either has operated, does not, in itself,
place their merger outside the scope of § 7. That section
speaks of "any . . . section of the country," and if anticompetitive effects of a merger are probable in "any"
significant market, the merger-at least to that extentis proscribed. 5
The parties do not dispute the findings of the District
Court that the Nation as a whole is the relevant geographic market for measuring the anticompetitive effects
of the merger viewed vertically or of the horizontal
merger of Brown's and Kinney's manufacturing facilities.
As to the retail level, however, they disagree.
The District Court found that the effects of this aspect
of the merger must be analyzed in every city with a population exceeding 10,000 and its immediate contiguous
surrounding territory in which both Brown and Kinney
sold shoes at retail through stores they either owned or
controlled.6 By this definition of the geographic mar65

To illustrate: If two retailers, one operating primarily in the

eastern half of the Nation, and the other operating largely in the
West, competed in but two mid-Western cities, the fact that the latter
outlets represented but a small share of each company's business
would not immunize the merger in those markets in which competition might be adversely affected. On the other hand, that fact would,
of course, be properly considered in determining the equitable relief
to be decreed. Cf. United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187
F. Supp. 545 (D. C. E. D. Pa.), aff'd, 365 U. S. 567.

ket, less than one-half of all the cities in which either
Brown or Kinney sold shoes through such outlets are
represented. The appellant recognizes that if the District Court's characterization of the relevant market is
proper, the number of markets in which both Brown and
Kinney have outlets is sufficiently numerous so that the
validity of the entire merger is properly judged by testing
its effects in those markets. However, it is appellant's
contention that the areas of effective competition in shoe
retailing were improperly defined by the District Court.
It claims that such areas should, in some cases, be defined
so as to include only the central business districts of large
cities, and in others, so as to encompass the "standard
metropolitan areas" within which smaller communities
are found. It argues that any test failing to distinguish
between these competitive situations is improper.
We believe, however, that the record fully supports
the District Court's findings that shoe stores in the outskirts of cities compete effectively with stores in central
chise Plan" and "Wohl Plan" stores were located. Although such
stores were not owned or directly controlled by Brown, did not sell
Brown products exclusively and did not finance inventory through
Brown, we believe there was adequate evidence before the District
Court to support its finding that such stores were "Brown stores." To
such stores Brown provided substantial assistance in the form of merchandising and advertising aids, reports on market and management
research, loans, group life and fire insurance and centralized purchase
of rubber footwear from manufacturers on Brown's credit. For these
services, Brown required the retailer to deal almost exclusively in
Brown's products in the price scale at which Brown shoes sold. Further, Brown reserved the power to terminate such franchise agreements on 30 days' notice. Since the retailer was required, under this
plan, to invest his own resources and develop his good will to a substantial extent in the sale of Brown products, the flow of which Brown
could readily terminate, Brown was able to exercise sufficient control
over these stores and departments to warrant their characterization as
"Brown" outlets for the purpose of measuring the share and effect
of Brown's competition at the retail level. Cf. Standard Oil Co. of
Californiav. United States, 337 U. S.293.

downtown areas, and that while there is undoubtedly
some commercial intercourse between smaller communities within a single "standard metropolitan area," the
most intense and important competition in retail sales
will be confined to stores within the particular communities in such an area and their immediate environs."
We therefore agree that the District Court properly
defined the relevant geographic markets in which to
analyze this merger as those cities with a population
exceeding 10,000 and their environs in which both Brown
and Kinney retailed shoes through their own outlets.
Such markets are large enough to include the downtown
shops and suburban shopping centers in areas contiguous
to the city, which are the important competitive factors,
and yet are small enough to exclude stores beyond the
immediate environs of the city, which are of little
competitive significance.
The Probable Effect of the Merger.
Having delineated the product and geographic markets
within which the effects of this merger are to be measured,
we turn to an examination of the District Court's finding
that as a result of the merger competition in the retailing
of men's, women's and children's shoes may be lessened
substantially in those cities in which both Brown and
Kinney stores are located. We note, initially, that appellant challenges this finding on a number of grounds other
than those discussed above and on grounds independent of
the critical question of whether competition may, in fact,
be lessened. Thus, Brown objects that the District Court
did not examine the competitive picture in each line of
commerce and each section of the country it had defined
as appropriate. It says the Court erred in failing to
enter findings with respect to each relevant city assessing
The District Court limited its findings to cities having a population of at least 10,000 persons, since Kinney operated only in such
areas.

the anticompetitive effect of the merger on the retail sale
of, for example, men's shoes in Council Bluffs, men's shoes
in Texas City, women's shoes in Texas City and children's
shoes in St. Paul. Even assuming a representative sample could properly be used, Brown also objects that the
District Court's detailed analysis of competition in shoe
retailing was limited to a single city-St. Louis-a city
in which Kinney did not operate. The appellant says
this analysis could not be sufficiently representative to
establish a standard image of the shoe trade which could
be applied to each of the more than 100 cities in which
Brown and Kinney sold shoes, particularly as some of
those cities were much smaller than St. Louis, others were
larger, some were in different climates and others were in
areas having different median per capita incomes.
However, we believe the record is adequate to support
the findings of the District Court. While it is true that
the court concentrated its attention on the structure of
competition in the city in which it sat and as to which
detailed evidence was most readily available, it also heard
witnesses from no less than 40 other cities in which the
parties to the merger operated. The court was careful
to point out that it was on the basis of all the evidence
that it reached its conclusions concerning the boundaries
of the relevant markets and the merger's effects on competition within them. We recognize that variations of
size, climate and wealth as enumerated by Brown exist
in the relevant markets. However, we agree with the
court below that the markets with respect to which evidence was received provide a fair sampling of all the
areas in which the impact of this merger is to be measured.
The appellant has not shown how the variables it has
mentioned could affect the structure of competition
within any particular market so as to require a change
in the conclusions drawn by the District Court. Each
competitor within a given market is equally affected by
these factors, even though the city in which he does busi-

ness may differ from St. Louis in size, climate or wealth.
Thus, we believe the District Court properly reached its
conclusions on the basis of the evidence available to it.
There is no reason to protract already complex antitrust
litigation by detailed analyses of peripheral economic
facts, if the basic issues of the case may be determined
through study of a fair sample."
In the case before us, not only was a fair sample used
to demonstrate the soundness of the District Court's conclusions, but evidence of record fully substantiates those
findings as to each relevant market. An analysis of
undisputed statistics of sales of shoes in the cities in
which both Brown and Kinney sell shoes at retail, separated into the appropriate lines of commerce, provides a
persuasive factual foundation upon which the required
prognosis of the merger's effects may be built. Although
Brown objects to some details in the Government's computations used in drafting these exhibits, appellant cannot deny the correctness of the more general picture they
reveal." We have appended the exhibits to this opinion.
68 See Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U. S.
293, 313; U. S. Atty. Gen. Nat. Comm. to Study the Antitrust Laws,

required, sufficient data to give the enforcement agencies, the courts
and business certainty as to competitive consequences would nullify
the words 'Where the effect may be' in the Clayton Act and convert
them into 'Where the effect is.'" And the Committee of the Judicial
Conference of the United States on Procedure in Antitrust and Other
Protracted Cases has also emphasized the need for limiting the mass
of possibly relevant evidence in cases of this type in order to avoid
confusion and its concomitant increased possibility of error. 13

69 Brown objects, for example, to the fact that these exhibits are
drafted on the basis of the cities concerning which census information
was available, rather than on the basis of the cities and their
environs-asthe relevant markets were defined by the District Court.
However, the record shows that the statistics of shoe sales in cities
by and large conform to statistics of shoe sales in counties in which
those cities are the principal metropolitan area. See Appendix D,

They show, for example, that during 1955 in 32 separate
cities, ranging in size and location from Topeka, Kansas,
to Batavia, New York, and Hobbs, New Mexico, the comin!ra. Thus, we find no error in a conclusion drawn as to a slightly
larger market from the available record of sales in cities alone. Brown
also objects to the use of pairage sales, rather than dollar volume, as
the basis for defining the size, and measuring Brown's shares, of the
market. However, since Brown and Kinney sold shoes primarily in
the low and medium price ranges, and in the light of the conceded
spread in shoe prices, we agree that sales measured by pairage provide
a more accurate picture of the Brown-Kinney shares of the market
than do sales measured in dollars. Detailed statistics of shoe sales
were available only in terms of dollar volume, however, and Brown
objects to the method by which the Government has converted those
figures into those reflecting sales in terms of pairage. The Government's conversion was, with some exceptions, based on national
median income and national averages of shoe prices and the ratio of
men, women and children in the population. The District Court
accepted expert testimony offered by the Government to the effect
that shoe price and population age, sex and income variations in the
relevant cities produced, at most, a 6% error in the converted statistics, and that this error was as likely to favor Brown (by increasing
the universe of sales against which Brown's shares were to be measured) as it was to disfavor it. We find no error in the District Court's
acceptance of the Government's evidence as to the propriety of the
accounting methods its experts employed. Lastly, Brown objects that
the statistics concerning its own pairage sales were improperly derived
since they included sales by its wholesale distributors to the retail outlets on its franchise plans in the same category as sales to ultimate consumers by its owned retail stores. Again, while recognizing a possible
margin of error in statistics combining sales at two levels of distribution, we believe they provide an adequate basis upon which to gauge
Brown sales through outlets it controlled. Particularly as the franchise stores were required to finance their own inventory, does it seem
reasonable to conclude that most of their purchases from Brown's distributors were eventually resold. In summary, although appellant
may point to technical flaws in the compilation of these statistics, we
recognize that in cases of this type precision in detail is less important
than the accuracy of the broad picture presented. We believe the
picture as presented by the Government in this case is adequate for
making the determination required by § 7: whether this merger may
tend to lessen competition substantially in the relevant markets.

bined share of Brown and Kinney sales of women's shoes
(by unit volume) exceeded 20%."o In 31 cities-some
the same as those used in measuring the effect of
the merger in the women's line-the combined share of
children's shoes sales exceeded 20%; in 6 cities their
share exceeded 40%. In Dodge City, Kansas, their combined share of the market for women's shoes was over
57%; their share of the children's shoe market in that
city was 49%. In the 7 cities in which Brown's and
Kinney's combined shares of the market for women's
shoes were greatest (ranging from 33% to 57%) each of
the parties alone, prior to the merger, had captured substantial portions of those markets (ranging from 13% to
34%); the merger intensified this existing concentration.
In 118 separate cities the combined shares of the market
of Brown and Kinney in the sale of one of the relevant
lines of commerce exceeded 5%. In 47 cities, their share
exceeded 5% in all three lines.
The market share which companies may control by
merging is one of the most important factors to be considered when determining the probable effects of the combination on effective competition in the relevant market.7 1
In an industry as fragmented as shoe retailing, the control of substantial shares of the trade in a city may have
important effects on competition. If a merger achieving

Although the sum of the parties' pre-existing shares of the market will normally equal their combined share of the immediate postmerger market, we recognize that this share need not remain stable
in the future. Nevertheless, such statistics provide a graphic picture
of the immediate impact of a merger, and, as such, also provide a
meaningful base upon which to build corclusions of the probable
future effects of the merger.

5% control were now approved, we might be required to
approve future merger efforts by Brown's competitors
seeking similar market shares. The oligopoly Congress
sought to avoid would then be furthered and it would be
difficult to dissolve the combinations previously approved.
Furthermore, in this fragmented industry, even if the combination controls but a small share of a particular market,
the fact that this share is held by a large national chain
can adversely affect competition. Testimony in the
record from numerous independent retailers, based on
their actual experience in the market, demonstrates
that a strong, national chain of stores can insulate
selected outlets from the vagaries of competition in particular locations and that the large chains can set and
alter styles in footwear to an extent that renders the
independents unable to maintain competitive inventories.
A third significant aspect of this merger is that it creates
a large national chain which is integrated with a manufacturing operation. The retail outlets of integrated
companies, by eliminating wholesalers and by increasing
the volume of purchases from the manufacturing division
of the enterprise, can market their own brands at prices
below those of competing independent retailers. Of
course, some of the results of large integrated or chain
operations are beneficial to consumers. Their expansion
is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact that small independent stores may be adversely affected. It is competition, not competitors, which the Act protects. But
we cannot fail to recognize Congress' desire to promote competition through the protection of viable, small,
locally owned businesses. Congress appreciated that
occasional higher costs and prices might result from the
maintenance of fragmented industries and markets. It
resolved these competing considerations in favor of decentralization. We must give effect to that decision.
Other factors to be considered in evaluating the probable effects of a merger in the relevant market lend addi-

tional support to the District Court's conclusion that this
merger may substantially lessen competition. One such
factor is the history of tendency toward concentration in
the industry.72 As we have previously pointed out, the
shoe industry has, in recent years, been a prime example
of such a trend. Most combinations have been between
manufacturers and retailers, as each of the larger producers has sought to capture an increasing number of
assured outlets for its wares. Although these mergers
have been primarily vertical in their aim and effect, to
the extent that they have brought ever greater numbers
of retail outlets within fewer and fewer hands, they have
had an additional important impact on the horizontal
plane. By the merger in this case, the largest single group
of retail stores still independent of one of the large manufacturers was absorbed into an already substantial aggregation of more or less controlled retail outlets. As a
result of this merger, Brown moved into second place
nationally in terms of retail stores directly owned. Including the stores on its franchise plan, the merger placed
under Brown's control almost 1,600 shoe outlets, or about
7.2% of the Nation's retail "shoe stores" as defined by
the Census Bureau,"3 and 2.3% of the Nation's total retail
72

See note 38, supra. A company's history of expansion through

mergers presents a different economic picture than a history of expansion through unilateral growth. Internal expansion is more likely

to be the result of increased demand for the company's products and
is more likely to provide increased investment in plants, more jobs and
greater output. Conversely, expansion through merger is more likely

to reduce available consumer choice while providing no increase in
industry capacity, jobs or output. It was for these reasons, among
others, Congress expressed its disapproval of successive acquisitions.

Section 7 was enacted to prevent even small mergers that added to
concentration in an industry. See S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d

shoe outlets.7 1 We cannot avoid the mandate of Congress that tendencies toward concentration in industry
are to be curbed in their incipiency, particularly when
those tendencies are being accelerated through giant
steps striding across a hundred cities at a time. In the
light of the trends in this industry we agree with the
Government and the court below that this is an appropriate place at which to call a halt.
At the same time appellant has presented no mitigating
factors, such as the business failure or the inadequate
resources of one of the parties that may have prevented
it from maintaining its competitive position, nor a demonstrated need for combination to enable small companies
to enter into a more meaningful competition with those
dominating the relevant markets. On the basis of the
record before us, we believe the Government sustained its
burden of proof. We hold that the District Court was
correct in concluding that this merger may tend to lessen
competition substantially in the retail sale of men's,
women's, and children's shoes in the overwhelming majority of those cities and their environs in which both Brown
and Kinney sell through owned or controlled outlets.

reflect the sale of Brown brand shoes through all outlets, regardless of ownership or control,
and are, therefore, marginally too high.

concurring.

MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.

I agree that so long as the Expediting Act, 15 U. S. C.
§ 29, is on the books we have no alternative but to accept
jurisdiction in this case. The Act declares that appeals
in civil antitrust cases in which the United States is
complainant lie only to this Court. It thus deprives
the parties of an intermediate appeal and this Court of the
benefit of consideration by a Court of Appeals. Under
our system a party should be entitled to at least one
appellate review, and since the sole opportunity in cases
under the Expediting Act is in this Court we usually note
jurisdiction. A fair consideration of the issues requires
us to carry out the function of a Court of Appeals by
examining the whole record and resolving all questions,
whether or not they are substantial. This is a great
burden on the Court and seldom results in much expedition, as in this case where 2%, years have passed since the
District Court's decision.
On the merits the case presents the question of whether,
under § 7 of the Clayton Act, the acquisition by Brown
of the Kinney retail stores may substantially lessen competition in shoes on a national basis or in any section
of the country.* To me § 7 is definite and clear. It
prohibits acquisitions, either of stock or assets, where
competition in any line of commerce in any section of the
country may be substantially lessened. The test as stated
in the Senate Report on the bill is whether there is "a
reasonable probability" that competition may be lessened.
An analysis of the record indicates (1) that Brown,
which makes all types of shoes, is the fourth largest
manufacturer in the country; (2) that Kinney likewise
manufactures some shoes but deals primarily in retailing,
having almost 400 stores that handle a substantial volume
*Since the judgment below can be supported on this theory, there
is no need to inquire into any tendency to create a monopoly.

OCTOBER TERM, 1961.

J., concurring.

370 U. S.

of sales; (3) that its acquisition would give Brown a
total of some 1,600 retail outlets, making it the second
largest retailer in the Nation; (4) that Kinney's stores
are on both a national and local basis strategically placed
from a retail market standpoint in suburban areas or
towns of over 10,000 population; (5) that Kinney's suppliers are small shoe manufacturers; (6) that Brown's
earlier acquisitions, seven in number in five years, indicate a pattern to increase the sale of Brown shoes through
the acquisition of independent outlets, resulting in the
loss of sales by small competing manufacturers; (7) that
statistics on these outlets indicate that Brown, after
acquisition, has materially increased its shipments of
Brown shoes to them, some as much as 50% ; and (8) that
the acquisition would have a direct effect on the small
manufacturers who previously enjoyed the Kinney
requirements market.
It would appear that the relevant line of commerce
would be shoes of all types. This is emphasized by the
nature of Brown' z manufacturing activity and its plan to
integrate the Kinney stores into its operations. The
competition affected thereby would be in the line handled
by these stores which is the full line of shoes manufactured by Brown. This conclusion is more in keeping
with the record as I read it and at the same time avoids
the charge of splintering the product line. Likewise, the
location of the Kinney stores points more to a national
market in shoes than a number of regional markets staked
by artificial municipal boundaries. Brown's business is
on a national scale and its policy of integration of
manufacturing and retailing is on that basis. I would
conclude, therefore, that it would be more reasonable to
define the line of commerce as shoes-those sold in the
ordinary retail store-and the market as the entire
country.

Opinion of

HARLAN,

357

J.

On this record but one conclusion can follow, i. e., that
the acquisition by Brown of the 400 Kinney stores for the
purposes of integrating their operation into its manufacturing activity created a "reasonable probability" that
competition in the manufacture and sale of shoes on a
national basis might be substantially lessened. I would
therefore affirm.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting in part and concurring
in part.
I would dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction,
believing that the case in its present posture is prematurely here because the judgment sought to be reviewed
is not yet final. Since the Court, however, holds that
the case is properly before us, I consider it appropriate,
after noting my dissent to this holding, to express my
views on the merits because the issues are of great importance. On that aspect, I concur in the judgment of the
Court but do not join its opinion, which I consider to go
far beyond what is necessary to decide the case.
JURISDICTION.

The Court's authority to entertain this appeal depends
on § 2 of the Expediting Act of 1903. That statute, in its
present form, provides (15 U. S. C. § 29):
"In every civil action brought in any district court
of the United States under any of said [antitrust]
Acts, wherein the United States is complainant, an
appeal from the final judgment of the district court
will lie only to the Supreme Court." (Emphasis
added.)
The Act was passed by a Congress which thereby
"sought . . . to ensure speedy disposition of suits in
equity brought by the United States under the Anti-

OCTOBER TERM, 1961.

HARLAN,

370 U. S.

J.

Trust Act." United States v. California Cooperative
Canneries, 279 U. S. 553, 558. This major policy consideration emerges clearly from the otherwise meager legislative history of the Act. See H. R. Rep. No. 3020, 57th
Cong., 2d Sess. (1903); 36 Cong. Rec. 1679, 1744, 1747.
It was in keeping with this purpose that "Congress limited the right of review to an appeal from the decree
which disposed of all matters .

.

. and .

.

. precluded

the possibility of an appeal to either [the Supreme Court
or the Court of Appeals] . . . from an interlocutory decree." United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, supra. For it was entirely consistent with its desire
to expedite these cases for Congress to have eliminated
the time-consuming delays occasioned by interlocutory
appeals either to intermediate courts or to this Court.
By taking jurisdiction over this appeal at the present
time, despite the fact that, even if affirmed, this case
would doubtless reappear on the Court's docket if the
terms of the District Court's divestiture decree are unsatisfactory to the appellant or to the Government, the Court
is paving the way for dual appeals in all government
antitrust cases where intricate divestiture judgments are
involved. Whether or not such a procedure is advisable
from the standpoint of judicial administration or practical business considerations-and I think such questions
by no means free from doubt-I believe that it is contrary
to the provisions and purposes of the Expediting Act, and
that the construction now given the Act does violence to
the accepted meaning of "final judgment" in the federal
judicial system.
The judgment from which this appeal is taken directs
the appellant to "relinquish and dispose of the stock, share
capital and assets" of the G. R. Kinney Company and
enjoins further interlocking interests between the two
corporations. It does not specify how the divestiture is
to be carried out, but directs appellant to file "a proposed

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
294

Opinion of

HARLAN,

J.

plan to carry into effect the divestiture order" and grants
the Government 30 days following such filing in which
to submit "opposition or suggestions thereto." When
considered in light of the District Court's opinion, this
reservation emerges as much more than a mere retention
of jurisdiction for the purpose of ministerially executing a
definite and precise final judgment. See, e. g., Ray v.
Law, 3 Cranch 179; French v. Shoemaker, 12 Wall. 86, 98.
In light of this Court's remarks in United States v. E. I.
du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U. S. 586, 607-608, the
District Court concluded that the particular form which
the divestiture order was to take was a matter which
"could have far-reaching effects and consequences," 179
F. Supp., at 741, and that it would be appropriate for
the court to conduct hearings on the manner in which the
Kinney stock ought to be disposed of by the appellant.
Hence it is not farfetched to assume that particular terms
of the remedy ordered by the District Court will be contested, and that this Court may well be asked to examine
the details relating to the anticipated divestiture. E. g.,
United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366
U. S.316.
The exacting obligation with respect to the terms of
antitrust decrees cast upon this Court by the Expediting
Act was commented upon only last Term. In United
States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U. S.316,
it was noted that it was the Court's practice, "particularly in cases of a direct appeal from the decree of a single
judge, . . . to examine the District Court's action closely
to satisfy ourselves that the relief is effective to redress
the antitrust violation proved." 366 U. S., at 323; see
International Boxing Club, Inc., v. United States, 358
U. S. 242, 253. In the present case the Court and the
parties know nothing more of "this most significant phase
of the case," United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,
340 U. S. 76, 89, than that Brown will generally be

required to divest itself of any interest in Kinney.
Exactly how this separation is to be accomplished has not
yet been determined, and there is no way of knowing now
whether both parties to the suit will find the decree satisfactory or whether one or both will seek further review
in this Court.
Despite the opportunity thus created for separate reviews of these kinds of cases at their "merits" and "relief"
stages, the Court holds that the judgment now in effect
has "sufficient indicia of finality" (ante, p. 308) to render
it appealable now, notwithstanding that the terms of the
ordered divestiture have not yet been fixed. This conclusion is based upon three discrete considerations, none
of which, in my opinion, serves to overcome the "final
judgment" requirement of the Expediting Act, as that
term has hitherto been understood in federal law.1
First. The Court suggests that any further proceedings
to be conducted in the District Court are "sufficiently independent of, and subordinate to, the issues presented by
this appeal" to permit them to be considered and reviewed
separately. But this judicially created exception to the
embracing principle of finality has never heretofore been
utilized by this Court to permit separate review of a District Court's decision on the underlying merits of a claim
when the details of the relief that is to be awarded are
yet uncertain. The present case does not present the
possibility, as did Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan
Corp., 337 U. S. 541, and Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201,
that a delay in appellate review would result in irreparable
"A final judgment is one which disposes of the whole subject,
gives all the relief that was contemplated, provides with reasonable
completeness, for giving effect to the judgment and leaves nothing
to be done in the cause save to superintend, ministerially, the execution of the decree." City of Louisa v. Levi, 140 F. 2d 512, 514. See,
e. g., Grant v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 106 U. S. 429; Taylor v. Board of
Education, 288 F. 2d 600.

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.

J.

harm, equivalent in effect to a denial of any review on
the point at issue. See 337 U. S., at 546; 6 How., at 204.
Nor is this a case in which the complaint's prayers for
relief are so diversified that the resolution of one branch
of the case "is independent of, and unaffected by, another
litigation with which it happens to be entangled." Radio
Station WOW, Inc., v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 126; see
CarondeletCanalCo. v. Louisiana,233 U. S. 362, 372-373;
Forgay v. Conrad, supra.
If the appellant were compelled to await the entry of
a particularized divestiture order before being granted
appellate review, it would suffer no irremediable loss;
indeed, in this case the merger was allowed to proceed
pendente lite, so any delay, to the extent that it could
affect the parties, would benefit the appellant. Nor can it
well be suggested that the particular conditions under
which the divestiture is to be executed are matters that
are only fortuitously "entangled" with the merits of the
complaint. Despite the seemingly mandatory tone of
the "divestiture" judgment now before us, the plain fact
remains that it is by its own terms inoperative to a
substantial extent until further proceedings are held in
the District Court. Unlike the cases relied upon by the
Court, therefore, this case comes up on appeal before the
appellant knows exactly what it has been ordered to do
or not to do. This is surely not the type of judgment
"which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment." Catlin
v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233; see Covington v.
Covington First National Bank, 185 U. S. 270, 277.
Second. The Court finds significant the "character of
the decree still to be entered in this suit." Ante, p. 309.
Since the order of full divestiture requires "careful,
and often extended, negotiation and formulation," ante, p.
309, it is suggested that a delay in carrying out its terms
might render them impractical or unenforceable. Apart
663026 0-62-27

OCTOBER TERM, 1961.
Opinion of

HARLAN,

J.

370 U. S.

from the fact that this policy consideration is more appropriately addressed to the Congress than to this Court, it
appears to me to call for a result directly contrary to that
reached by the Court. For if the terms of the divestiture
are indeed so difficult to formulate and so interrelated
with market conditions, it is most unlikely that the decree
to be issued by the District Court will turn out to be satisfactory to both parties. Consequently, on the Court's
own reasoning, a second appearance of this case on our
docket is not an imaginative possibility but a reasonable likelihood. In stating that the divestiture portion
of this judgment "is disputed here on an 'all or nothing'
basis," and that "it is ripe for review now, and will, thereafter, be foreclosed," ante, p. 309, the Court can hardly
mean that either the appellant or the Government will be
precluded from seeking review of the divestiture terms if
it deems them unsatisfactory. Indeed, neither side on
this appeal has addressed itself to the propriety of the
divestiture remedy, as such, that is independently of
the question whether the merger itself runs afoul of the
Clayton Act.
Moreover, if it is delay between formulation of the
decree and its execution that is thought to be damaging,
what reason is there to believe that this delay or its hazards will be any greater if the entire case is brought up
here once than if review is separately sought from the
divestiture decree once its terms have been settled? Nor
can it be maintained that if the merits are now affirmed
then an appeal on the question of relief is improbable.
For insofar as complex "negotiation and formulation" is
a factor, the probability of an appeal is equally likely in
either instance.
Third. The Court's final reason for holding this judgment appealable is that similar judgments have often
been reviewed here in the past with no issue ever having
been raised regarding jurisdiction. But the cases are

BROWN SHOE CO. v. UNITED STATES.
294

legion which have echoed the answer given by Chief Justice Marshall to a contention that the Court was bound
on a jurisdictional point by its consideration on the merits
of a case in which the jurisdictional question had gone
unnoticed: "No question was made, in that case, as to the
jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does
not consider itself as bound by that case." United States
v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172; see Snow v. United States,
118 U. S. 346,354; Cross v. Burke, 146 U. S. 82,87; Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, 191 U. S. 225, 236; New v. Oklahoma, 195 U. S. 252, 256; United States ex rel. Arant v.
Lane, 245 U. S. 166, 170; Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok
Po, 336 U. S. 368, 379; United States v. L. A. Tucker
Truck Lines, 344 U. S. 33, 38. The fact that the Court
may, in the past, have overlooked the lack of finality in
some of the judgments that came here for review in similar posture to this one does not now free it from the
requirements of the Expediting Act. Nor does the fact
that none of the cases reviewed in what now appears to
have been an interlocutory stage was ever appealed again
justify disregard of the statute. This history might point
to the desirability of an amendment to the Expediting
Act, but it does not make into a "final judgment" a decree
which reserves for future determination the terms of the
precise relief to be afforded.
The Court suggests that a "pragmatic approach" to
finality is called for in light of the policies of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, which direct the "just, speedy,
and inexpensive determination of every action." Ante,
p. 306. But this misconceives the nature of the issue that
is presented. Whether this judgment is final and appealable is not a question turning on the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure or on any balance of policies by this
Court. Congress has seen fit to make this Court, for
reasons which are less than obvious, the sole appellate
tribunal for civil antitrust suits instituted by the United

OCTOBER TERM. 1961.
Opinion of

HARLAN, J.

370 U. S.

States. In so doing, it has chosen to limit this Court's
reviewing power to "final judgments." Whether the first
of these legislative determinations, made in 1903, when
appeal as of right to this Court was the rule rather than
the exception, should survive the expansion in the Court's
docket and the development, pursuant to the Judiciary
Act of 1925, of this Court's discretionary certiorari
jurisdiction, may never have been given adequate consid2
eration by the Congress.
At this period of mounting dockets there is certainly
much to be said in favor of relieving this Court of the
often arduous task of searching through voluminous trial
testimony and exhibits to determine whether a single district judge's findings of fact are supportable. The legal
issues in most civil antitrust cases are no longer so novel
or unsettled as to make them especially appropriate for
initial appellate consideration by this Court, as compared
with those in a variety of other areas of federal law.
And under modern conditions it may well be doubted
whether direct review of such cases by this Court truly
serves the purpose of expedition which underlay the original passage of the Expediting Act. I venture to predict
that a critical reappraisal of the problem would lead
to the conclusion that "expedition" and also, over-all,
more satisfactory appellate review would be achieved in
For example, the report which accompanied the 1925 Act to the
floor of the Senate said of the cases in which direct appeal from a
District Court to the Supreme Court was retained: "As is well known,
there are certain cases which, under the present law, may be taken
2

directly from the district court to the Supreme Court. Without
entering into a description of these four classes of cases, it is sufficient
to say that under the existing law these are cases which must be heard
by three judges, one of whom is a circuit judge." S. Rep. No. 362,
68th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1924). (Emphasis added.) This generalization was obviously erroneous since the Expediting Act provided for
direct review in this Court of government antitrust cases decided
by a single district judge.

these cases were primary appellate jurisdiction returned
to the Court of Appeals, leaving this Court free to
exercise its certiorari power with respect to particular
cases deemed deserving of further review. As things now
stand this Court must deal with all government civil antitrust cases, often either at the unnecessary expenditure
of its own time or at the risk of inadequate appellate
review if a summary disposition of the appeal is made.
Further, such a jurisdictional change would bid fair to
satisfy the very "policy" arguments suggested by the
Court in this case. For the Courts of Appeals, whose
dockets are generally less crowded than those of this
Court, would then be authorized to hear appeals from
orders such as the one here in question. Since this order
grants an injunction against interlocking interests between
Brown and Kinney, it would come within 28 U. S. C.
§ 1292 (a) (1) were this not a case "where a direct review
may be had in the Supreme Court."
So long, however, as the present Expediting Act continues to commend itself to Congress this Court is bound
by its limitations, and since for the reasons already given
the decree appealed cannot, in my opinion, be properly
considered a "final judgment," I think the appeal, at this
juncture, should have been dismissed.
THE MERITS.

Since the Court nonetheless holds that the judgment
is appealable in its present form, and since the underlying
questions are far-reaching, I consider it a duty to express
my view on the merits. On this aspect of the case I join
the disposition which affirms the judgment of the District
Court, though I am not prepared to subscribe to all that
is said or implied in the opinion of this Court.
The question presented by this case can be stated in
narrow and concise terms: Are the District Court's conclusions that the effect of the Brown-Kinney merger may

OCTOBER TERM, 1961.
Opinion of HARLAN, J.

be, in the language of § 7 of the Clayton Act, "substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly" in "any line of commerce in any section of the
country" sustainable? In other words, does the indefinite
and general language in § 7 manifest a congressional purpose to proscribe a combination of this sort? Brown contends that in finding the merger illegal the District Court
lumped together what are in fact discrete "lines of commerce," that it failed to define an appropriate "section
of the country," and that when the case is properly viewed
any lessening of competition that may be caused by the
merger is not "substantial." For reasons stated below, I
think that each of these contentions is untenable.
The dispositive considerations are, I think, found in
the "vertical" effects of the merger, that is, the effects
reasonably to be foreseen from combining Brown's manufacturing facilities with Kinney's retail outlets. In my
opinion the District Court's conclusions as to such effects
are supported by the record, and suffice to condemn the
merger under § 7, without regard to what might be deemed
to be the "horizontal" effects of the transaction.
1. "Line of Commerce."-In considering both the horizontal and vertical aspects of this merger, the District
Court analyzed the probable impact on competition in
terms of three relevant "lines of commerce"-men's shoes,
women's shoes, and children's shoes. It rejected Brown's
claim that shoes of different construction or of different
price range constituted distinct lines of commerce. Whatever merit there might be to Brown's contention that the
product market should be more narrowly defined when
it is viewed from the vantage point of the ultimate consumer (whose pocketbook, for example, may limit his
purchase to a definite price range), the same is surely not
true of the shoe manufacturer. Although the record contains evidence tending to prove that a shoe manufacturing

HARLAN, J.

plant may be managed more economically if its production is limited to only one type and grade of shoe, the history of Brown's own factories reveals that a single plant
may be used in successive years, or even at the same
time, for the manufacture of varying grades of shoes and
may, without undue difficulty, be shifted from the production of children's shoes to men's or women's shoes, or
vice versa.
Because of this flexibility of manufacture, the product
market with respect to the merger between Brown's manufacturing facilities and Kinney's retail outlets might
more accurately be defined as the complete wearingapparel shoe market, combining in one the three components which the District Court treated as separate lines
of commerce. Such an analysis, taking into account the
interchangeability of production, would seem a more
realistic gauge of the possible anticompetitive effects in
the shoe manufacturing industry of a merger between a
shoe manufacturer and a retailer than the District Court's
compartmentalization in terms of the buying public. For
if a manufacturer of women's shoes is able, albeit at some
expense, to convert his plant to the production of men's
shoes, the possibility of such a shift should be considered
in deciding whether the market for either men's shoes or
women's shoes can be monopolized or whether a particular merger substantially lessens competition among
manufacturers of either product. See Adelman, Economic
Aspects of the Bethlehem Opinion, 45 Va. L. Rev. 684,
689-691; cf. United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334
U. S. 495, 510-511; but see United States v. Bethlehem
Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 592.
The fact that § 7 speaks of the lessening of competition
"in any line of commerce" (emphasis added) does not, of
course, mean that the product market on which the effect
of the merger is considered may be defined as narrowly

3
or as broadly as the Government chooses to define it.
The duty rests with the District Court, and ultimately
with this Court, to determine what is the appropriate
market on an appraisal of the relevant economic considerations. Discovering the product market is "a necessary
predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act,"
United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nenovrs & Co., 353
U. S. 586, 593, and the breadth of the statutory language
provides no license for an abdication of this necessary
function. In light of the production flexibility demonstrated by the undisputed facts in this case, I think the
line of commerce by which the vertical aspects of the
Brown-Kinney merger should be judged is the wearingapparel shoe industry generally.
2. "Section of the Country."-This merger involves
nationwide concerns which sell and purchase shoes in
various localities throughout the country, so that it
appears that the most suitable geographical market for
appraising the alleged anticompetitive effects of the vertical combination is the Nation as a whole. This finding
of the District Court (limited to the vertical aspect of
the merger) is not contested by Brown and is properly
accepted here. One caveat is in order, however. In
judging the anticompetitive effect of the merger on the
national market, it must be recognized that any decline
in competition that might result need not have a uniform
effect throughout the entire country. It is sufficient if
3 As the Court noted in United States v. E. I. du Pont de Neinours
& Co., 351 U. S. 377, 393, "one can theorize that we have monopolistic
competition in every nonstandardized commodity with each manufacturer having power over the price and production of his own
product." If the Government were permitted to choose its "line
of commerce" it could presumably draw the market narrowly in a
case that turns on the existence vel non of monopoly power and
draw it broadly when the question is whether both parties to a merger
are within the same competitive market.

the record proves that as a result of the merger competition will generally be lessened, though its most serious
impact may be felt in certain localities.
3. "Substantially to Lessen Competition."-The remaining question is whether the merger of Brown's
manufacturing facilities with Kinney's retail outlets
"may . . . substantially lessen competition" or "tend to
create a monopoly" in the nationwide market in which
shoe manufacturers sell to shoe retailers. The findings
of the District Court, supported by the evidence, when
taken together with undisputed facts appearing in the
record, justify the conclusion that a substantial lessening
of competition in the relevant market is a "reasonable
probability." S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 6
(1950).
On the date of the merger Kinney's retail stores numbered 352, and this figure had increased to more than 400
by the time of the trial. Nearly all these stores sell men's,
women's, and children's shoes and are located in the downtown areas of cities of at least 10,000 population. In 116
of these cities, Kinney's combined pairage sale of shoes
for 1955 exceeded 10% of all shoes sold in the city during
the year. Its total retail shoe sales during the year constituted 1.2% of the national total in terms of dollar volume and 1.6% in terms of pairage. Of these shoes, only
20% were supplied by the Kinney manufacturing plants,
the remainder coming from some 197 other sources.4
Prior to 1955 Kinney had bought none of its outsidesource shoes from Brown, and its records for 1955 reveal
that the year's purchases were made from a diverse number of independent shoe manufacturers. There were 66
suppliers (including Brown) in that year each of whose
total sales to Kinney exceeded $50,000, and only three of
4 The schedule in the record of Kinney's outside shoe suppliers for
the calendar year 1955 lists 319 vendors, but 122 of these supplied
less than $1,000 worth of goods during the year.

these (Brown, Endicott-Johnson Co., and Georgia Shoe
Manufacturing Co.) were large companies whose output
placed them among the 25 most productive nonrubber
shoe manufacturers in the United States. Consequently,
it appears that Kinney was a substantial purchaser of the
shoes produced by many small independent shoe manufacturers throughout the country. In fact, the record
affirmatively shows that at least five of Kinney's suppliers,
three of which are located in the State of New York, one
in Pennsylvania, and one in New Hampshire, each relied
upon Kinney to purchase more than 40% of its total
production in 1955.
That the merger between Brown's shoe production
plants and Kinney's retail outlets will tend to foreclose
some of the large market which smaller shoe manufacturers found in sales to Kinney hardly seems open to
doubt. This conclusion is supported by the following
facts which emerge indisputably from the record: (1) In
the shoe industry, as in many others, the purchase of a
retail chain by a manufacturer results in an increased
flow of the purchasing manufacturer's shoes to the retail
store. Hence independent shoe manufacturers find it
more difficult to sell their shoes to an acquired retail chain
than to an independent one. (2) The result of Brown's
earlier acquisition of two retail chains was, in each instance, a substantial increase in the quantity of Brown
shoe purchases by the previously independent chains.5
5 In 1951 Brown purchased the Wohl Shoe Company, which operated leased shoe departments in department stores throughout the
country. Before its acquisition of Wohl, Brown had supplied 12.8%
of Wohl's shoe requirements; by 1957, it was supplying 33.6% of

Wohl's needs.
In 1953, Brown purchased a partial interest in a small chain of
retail stores in Los Angeles known as Wetherby-Kayser. Before
this purchase, Brown had supplied 10.4% of Wetherby's shoes; within
one year this percentage increased to almost 50%.

(3) The history of many of Brown's plants proves that
they may be readily adapted to the production of the
grade and style of shoes customarily sold in Kinney stores. 6
(4) Although Brown supplied none of Kinney's requirements before the merger, it was supplying almost 8%
of these requirements just two years thereafter.
The dollar volume of Kinney's outside shoe purchases
in 1955 was between 16 and 17 million dollars, and this
amount had increased to 19.4 million by 1957. While
Kinney was making only about 1.2% of the total retail
dollar sales in the United States in 1955, that percentage
can hardly be deemed an accurate reflection of its proportion of nationwide shoe purchases by retailers since the
retail-sales figure is based on a computation that includes
all retail stores, whether or not they were vertically integrated or otherwise affiliated. In terms of available markets for independent shoe manufacturers, the percentage
of Kinney's purchases must have been substantially
larger-though the precise figure is unavailable on the
record before us.!
If the controlling test were, as it may be under the
similar language of § 3 of the Clayton Act, one of "quanti6 In

addition, it appears from the record that shortly after the

merger was effected, Kinney abandoned its earlier policy of selling
only Kinney-brand shoes (80% of which were "made up" for it by
its manufacturers) and began selling a considerable number of Brown's
branded and advertised shoes. Along with the indications in the
record that Kinney was beginning also to sell higher-priced shoes in
its suburban outlets, this suggests that Brown could supply much of
Kinney's needs with only a minimal additional capital investment.
I The existence of such gaps in the record make a fair assessment
of the effects of this merger more difficult than it would otherwise be.
One of the reasons why I would not consider the horizontal aspect
of this merger is my conviction that the data supplied by the Government is entirely inadequate for a proper evaluation of the impact
of the horizontal merger on competition.

tative substantiality," compare StandardOil Co. v. United
States, 337 U. S. 293, with Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U. S. 320, the probable foreclosure of
independent manufacturers from this substantial share of
the available retail shoe market would be enough to render the vertical aspect of this merger unlawful under § 7.
But since the merger can be shown to have an injurious
effect on competition among manufacturers and among
retailers, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Standard Stations formula is applicable.
The vertical affiliation between this shoe manufacturer and a primarily retail organization is surely not, as
the dissenters thought the contractual tie in Standard
Stations to be, "a device for waging competition" rather
than "a device for suppressing competition." 337 U. S.,
at 323. Since Brown is able by reason of this merger to
turn an independent purchaser into a captive market for
its shoes it inevitably diminishes the available market for
which shoe manufacturers compete. If Brown shoes replace those which had been previously produced by others,
the displaced manufacturers have no choice but to
enter some other market or go out of business. Since
all manufacturers, including Brown, had competed for
Kinney's patronage when it was unaffiliated, Brown's
merger with Kinney potentially withdraws a share of
the market previously available to the independent shoe
manufacturers.
Not only may this merger, judged from a vertical standpoint, affect manufacturers who compete with Brown; it
may also adversely affect competition on the retailing
level. With a large manufacturer such as Brown behind
it, the Kinney chain would have a great competitive
advantage over the retail stores with which it vies for consumer patronage. As a manufacturer-owned outlet, the
Kinney store would doubtless be able to sell its shoes at a

lower profit margin and outlast an independent competitor. The merger would also effectively prevent the retail
competitor from dealing in Brown shoes, since these might
be offered at lower prices in Kinney stores than elsewhere."
Brown contends that even if these anticompetitive
effects are probable, they touch upon an insignificant
share of the market and are not, therefore, "substantial"
within the meaning of § 7. Our decision in Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U. S. 320, is cited as
authority for the proposition that a foreclosure of about
1% of the relevant market is necessarily insubstantial.
But the opinion in Tampa Electric carefully noted that
"substantiality in a given case" depends on a variety of
factors. 365 U. S., at 329. Two of the considerations
that were mentioned were "the relative strength of the
parties" and "the probable immediate and future effects
which pre-emption of that share of the market might
have on effective competition therein." Ibid. When, as
here, the foreclosure of what may be considered a small
percentage of retailers' purchases may be caused by the
combination of the country's third largest seller of shoes
with the country's largest family-style shoe store chain,
and when the volume of the latter's purchases from independent manufacturers in various parts of the country is
large enough to render it probable that these suppliers,
if displaced, will have to fall by the wayside, it cannot,
in my opinion, be said that the effect on the shoe industry
is "remote" or "insubstantial."
I reach this result without considering the findings of
the District Court respecting the trend in the shoe industry towards "oligopoly" and vertical integration. The
8 The change in Kinney policy whereby it now carries shoes bearing the Brown brand (see note 6, supra) tends to make retailer
competition still more difficult.

9 In terms of bare numbers, the quantity of retail outlets owned or
controlled by the major manufacturers has undoubtedly been increasing since 1947. But much of the data in the record is incomplete
in this regard because it is based on varying standards. Thus, while
the Government argues that the increase in percentage of national
retail sales by shoe chains owning 101 or more outlets from 20.9%
in 1948 to 25.5% in 1954 proves the trend toward "oligopoly," the
appellant's statistics, founded upon retail sales by all outlets (including general merchandise and clothing stores), show that retail sales
by chains of 11 or more stood at a constant 19.5% of national dollar
volume in both 1948 and 1954. Moreover, the apparent decline in
the proportional share of the country's shoe needs supplied by the
largest manufacturers between 1947 and 1955 belies any claim that
shoe production is becoming "oligopolistic." Whereas the largest four
manufacturers supplied 25.9% of the Nation's needs in 1947, the
largest eight supplied 31.4%, and the largest 15 supplied 36.2%, in
1955 the equivalent percentages were 22%, 27%, and 32.5%.
There is no suggestion in the record as to whether earlier purchases
of retail chains by shoe manufacturers reduced the number of independent manufacturers or otherwise harmed competition. Consequently, while the record does establish that manufacturers have been
increasing the number of their retail outlets, it is entirely silent on
the effects of this vertical expansion.
