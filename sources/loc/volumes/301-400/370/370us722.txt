MARAKAR v. UNITED STATES.
370 U. S.

Per Curiam.

MARAKAR v. UNITED STATES.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 1191, Misc.

Decided June 25, 1962.*

Certiorari granted; judgments vacated; causes remanded with directions to dismiss the indictments.
Reported below: 300 F. 2d 513.

Joseph F. Walsh for petitioner in No. 1191, Misc.
Harry T. Carter for petitioner in No. 1234, Misc.
Solicitor General Cox for the United States.
PER CURIAM.

The motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperisare
granted. On motion of the Solicitor General and upon
an examination of the entire record, the petitions for writs
of certiorari are granted, the judgments are vacated, and
the causes are remanded to the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey with directions to
dismiss the indictments.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR.
JUSTICE BRENNAN join the Court's disposition because

they believe that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the
Fifth Amendment was an insurmountable barrier to the
prosecution of these petitioners under the separate indictments returned on April 26, 1961, charging each petitioner
with a substantive offense of illegally bringing opium into
this country. See Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187,
196 (separate opinion); cf. Petite v. United States, 361
U. S. 529, 533 (dissenting opinion).
took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

*Together with No. 1234, Misc., Ali v. United States, also on
petition for writ of certiorari to the same Court.
