370 U. S.

Per Curiam.

ALLEN v. BANNAN, WARDEN.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 535, Misc.

Decided June 25, 1962.

Certiorari granted; judgment vacated; case remanded to the District
Court for a hearing on the merits of petitioner's application for a
writ of habeas corpus, since petitioner has exhausted state remedies.

Petitioner pro se.
Frank J. Kelley, Attorney General of Michigan, Eugene
Krasicky, Solicitor General, and George Mason, Assistant
Attorney General, for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded to the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan for a hearing on the merits of the petitioner's
application for a writ of habeas corpus. After an examination of the briefs filed by the parties and of the record
in this case as well as an examination of the record certified to this Court by the Clerk of the Supreme Court of
Michigan in Allen v. Michigan, 364 U. S. 934, we conclude that the petitioner has exhausted state remedies.
