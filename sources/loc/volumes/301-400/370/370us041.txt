Per Curiam.

BEARD v. STAHR, SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY,

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 648.

Decided May 28, 1962.

After administrative proceedings by an Army Board of Inquiry and
a Board of Review under 10 U. S. C. (Supp. II) §§ 3792 and 3793
had resulted in a recommendation that the Secretary of the Army
remove appellant, a commissioned officer in the Regular Army,
from the active list and award him a general discharge, but before
the Secretary had taken any action under § 3794, appellant sued
in a Federal District Court to enjoin the Secretary from determining
whether he should be removed. He claimed that the administrative
proceedings were unconstitutional because they deprived him of his
office and retirement benefits without due process of law. The
District Court sustained the constitutionality of the statute and
the administrative proceedings and dismissed the complaint. Held:
The judgment is vacated with directions to dismiss the complaint as
premature. Application for a stay is denied. Pp. 41-42.
Reported below: 200 F. Supp. 766.

Frederick Bernays Wiener for appellant.
Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General
Orrick and John G. Laughlin, Jr. for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the
cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint. The action is premature. The appellant will
not be removed from the active list of the Regular Army
unless the Secretary of the Army exercises the discretionary authority to remove him conferred by 10 U. S. C.

§ 3794. The Secretary has not stated that he will so exercise his discretion as to remove appellant. If the Secretary does not remove the appellant it will be unnecessary

to pass on the constitutional objections which have been
urged. If appellant is removed, the Court is satisfied that
adequate procedures for seeking redress will be open to
him. Compare Aircraft & Diesel Corp. v. Hirsch, 331
U. S. 752, 772-773. Accordingly, the application for a
stay is denied.
is of the opinion that further consideration of the question of jurisdiction should be postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits and would
grant the application for a stay.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

took no part in the decision

of this case.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK

concurs, dissenting.
Appellant is a Major in the Regular Army and has the
temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He, served in
World War II and received the Bronze Star Medal. He
at present has had over 19 years of active federal service
and will be eligible for retirement in November 1962.
But for the present charge against him his military record
reflects exemplary conduct and high efficiency ratings.
These years of faithful service have now gone largely
for naught under a decision of an Army Board of Review
recommending that he be given a general discharge.
Whatever the merits may be, I believe that the procedure
used at his hearing violated our standards of fairness.
Under the statute here in question, 10 U. S. C.
§ 3792 (c), an officer faced with a charge carries the burden of proof that "he should be retained on the active
list."
The District Court held that there was no constitutional objection to placing this burden of proof on the
officer. 200 F. Supp. 766, 775. It reasoned that since

BEARD v. STAHR.
41

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting.

the President could dismiss an officer summarily,* Congress could place on the one removed "the onus of convincing his superiors that he should not be eliminated."
Ibid. Dismissal is one thing; dismissal with stigma, as
here, is quite another. Dismissal with stigma is a severe
penalty. In comparable situations, the Government has
been required to carry the burden of proof. Kwong Hai
Chew v. Rogers, 103 U. S. App. D. C. 228, 257 F. 2d 606;
Wood v. Hoy, 266 F. 2d 825, 830. Unless this burden is
meticulously maintained, discharge for race, for religion,
for political opinion, or for beliefs may masquerade under
unproved charges. This right, like the right to be heard,
is basic to our society. Cf. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee
Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123, 168 (concurring
opinion); Beilan v. Board of Education, 357 U. S. 399,
421-423 (dissenting opinion); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344
U. S. 183, 191.
There is a second reason why we should remand this
case for a new hearing. The one witness whose testimony
was critical to the case was not called. Confrontation
and cross-examination are, as I understand the law, vital
when one's employment rights are involved (see Greene v.
McElroy, 360 U. S. 474, 496)-the factor thaf distinguishes Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886,
where the only question was access to a military base.
Perhaps the missing accuser-whose activities were described in uncomplimentary terms in Rittenour v. District
of Columbia, 163 A. 2d 558-would have made such an
unbecoming witness that the Board would have dismissed
the charges. Faceless informers are often effective if they
need not take the stand. A fair hearing requires the production of the accuser so that cross-examination can test
his character and reliability. That question is very close
*Which, of course, is a mistaken premise.

See Wiener v. United

State8, 357 U. S. 349; Blake v. United State8, 103 U. S. 227, 231.

to the one involved in No. 1123, Misc., Williams v.
Zuckert, in which we granted certiorari only the other
day. 369 U. S. 884. This case should be heard with
that one.
I think the present case is ripe for review. Once the Secretary of the Army approves the decision now challenged,
appellant will be severed from military service with less
than an honorable discharge. If a wrong was committed,
I assume that he could recover a judgment that restores
any loss of salary or pension. More than dollars, however,
are involved: at stake is a man's professional standing,
his character, and his claim to an honorable discharge.
Where the Army departs from the statutory standard
which prescribes the basis on which discharges will be
issued, the federal courts can intervene. See Harmon v.
Brucker, 355 U. S.579. Though the Court's opinion may
be read as indicating that a collateral proceeding to set
aside one discharge and to direct that an honorable one be
granted may lie, we should nonetheless halt this irregular
procedure in limine. For we are dealing here with the
charge of "conduct unbecoming an officer," a charge that
carries a heavy stigma. As Winthrop said: "Though it
need not amount to a crime, it must offend so seriously
against law, justice, morality or decorum as to expose to
disgrace, socially or as a man, the offender, and at the same
time must be of such a nature or committed under such
circumstances as to bring dishonor or disrepute upon the
military profession which he represents." Military Law
and Precedents (2d ed. 1896) 1104.
If declaratory relief will be accorded, as it certainly
could be (Bland v. Connally, 110 U. S. App. D. C. 375, 293
F. 2d 852), this action for an injunction is timely to prevent an injustice. As recently stated: "We think it must
be conceded that any discharge characterized as less than
honorable will result in serious injury. It not only means

BEARD v. STAHR.

J., dissenting.

the loss of numerous benefits in both the federal and state
systems, but it also results in an unmistakable social
stigma which greatly limits the opportunities for both
public and private civilian employment." 110 U. S. App.
D. C. 375, 381, 293 F. 2d 852, 858.
I would reverse the judgment below and direct that
appellant be accorded a hearing that comports with the
requirements of due process.
