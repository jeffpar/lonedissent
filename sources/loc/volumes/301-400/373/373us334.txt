ANDREWS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND

No. 491.

CIRCUIT.

Argued March 25-26, 1963.Decided May 20, 1963.*

In a Federal District Court, petitioners were convicted of violating
certain federal criminal statutes and were sentenced to imprisonment. Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals;
but their cases were remanded for resentencing. They were resentenced, and the judgments were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
Several years later, petitioners moved in the District Court that
their sentences be vacated and that they be resentenced, on the
ground that they had not been given an opportunity to make statements in their own behalves, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (a), either when they were originally sentenced
or when they were resentenced. Finding this to be true, the District Court granted their motions and ordered that petitioners be
returned to it for resentencing. Without waiting for them to be
resentenced, the Government appealed to the Court of Appeals.
Held: Petitioners' motions should be considered as having been
made in collateral proceedings under 28 U. S. C. § 2255; the District Court's orders were interlocutory, not final; and the Court of
Appeals did not have jurisdiction of the Government's appeal.

Wayne G. Barnett argued the cause for the United
States. On the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Beatrice Rosenberg and

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The two petitioners and a co-defendant were convicted
in a Federal District Court upon a three-count indictment
charging that they had (1) assaulted a Post Office employee with intent to rob in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 2114,
(2) put the life of the Post Office employee in jeopardy
by the use of a dangerous weapon in violation of 18
U. S. C. § 2114, and (3) conspired together to violate the
aforesaid statute in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 371. The
district judge sentenced each defendant to concurrent
prison terms of 25 years on Count 2 and five years on
Count 3.1 None of the defendants was asked before the
sentences were imposed whether he had anything to
say in his own behalf. On appeal, the convictions were
affirmed, but the cases were remanded to the District
Court for resentencing on Count 2, on the ground that the
trial judge had been in error in thinking that under the
statute ' he was without power to suspend sentence and
grant probation on that count. United States v. Donovan, 242 F. 2d 61. Upon remand, the District Court
suspended the 25-year sentence which had been imposed
on the petitioners' co-defendant, but resentenced the two
'No sentence was imposed on Count 1, because the court concluded that the conviction under this count had merged with the
conviction under Count 2.
2 "Whoever assaults any person having lawful charge, control, or
custody of any mail matter or of any money or other property of
the United States, with intent to rob, steal, or purloin such mail
matter, money, or other property of the United States, or robs any
such person of mail matter, or of any money, or other property of
the United States, shall, for the first offense, be imprisoned not more
than ten years; and if in effecting or attempting to effect such robbery he wounds the person having custody of such mail, money, or
other property of the United States, or puts his life in jeopardy by
the use of a dangerous weapon, or for a subsequent offense, shall be
imprisoned twenty-five years." 18 U. S. C. § 2114.

petitioners to 25-year prison terms. Again, neither petitioner was afforded an opportunity to speak in his own
behalf before the sentences were imposed. The Court of
Appeals reaffirmed the convictions. United States v.
Donovan, 252 F. 2d 788.
The proceedings now before us began when the petitioner Donovan filed a motion in the District Court
requesting that his sentence "be vacated and he be resentenced" on the ground that, contrary to Rule 32 (a) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, he had been
afforded no opportunity to make a statement in his own
behalf either at the time of the original sentence or when
the sentence was reimposed.3 The District Court granted
the motion and ordered that Donovan "be returned to
this district for resentencing." The petitioner Andrews
then wrote to Judge Murphy, the district judge who had
acted on Donovan's motion, pointing out that "the identical circumstances exist with me" and asking for similar
relief. Judge Murphy ordered that Andrews too be returned to the District Court for resentencing. The Government filed a notice of appeal from both orders, and the
resentencing of the petitioners was stayed upon the Government's motion. The Court of Appeals ruled that its
appellate jurisdiction had been properly invoked, and on
the merits reversed the orders of the District Court, holding that under this Court's decisions in Hill v. Unitd
States, 368 U. S. 424, and Machibroda v. United States,
368 U. S. 487, the sentencing court's failure to comply
with Rule 32 (a) did not constitute a ground for collateral
relief. 301 F. 2d 376. We granted certiorari, 371 U. S.
812.
As to the merits of the issue decided by the Court of
Appeals, the petitioners contend that there was here not
3 Rule 32 (a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provides in
pertinent part as follows: "Before imposing sentence the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own
behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment."

Opinion of the Court.

a mere failure to comply with the formal requirements of
Rule 32 (a) as in Hill and Machibroda,but that a number
of aggravating circumstances accompanied the sentencing
court's denial of the petitioners' right of allocution. And
the Court's opinions in Hill and Machibroda, say the
petitioners, clearly implied that collateral relief would be
available in a case where such circumstances were shown
to exist. Cf. United States v. Taylor, 303 F. 2d 165, 167168. But the petitioners argue preliminarily that the
Government had no right of appeal in these cases. We
agree with the petitioners that the Court of Appeals did
not have appellate jurisdiction, and accordingly, without
reaching the merits, we set aside the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the cases to the District
Court so that the petitioners may be resentenced in
accordance with the District Court's orders.
The motion which Donovan filed in the sentencing court
was denominated by him as one made under Rule 35 of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.' Anderson's
letter did not mention Rule 35, but in an affidavit opposing Anderson's request, an Assistant United States Attorney conceded that the "factual and legal posture of
this application therefore is identical to the similar motion
of Robert L. Donovan." Both applications were filed
in the District Court under the docket number of the
original criminal case.
In view of this treatment of the motions by the parties
and the trial court, the Court of Appeals was asked to
consider the motions also as filed in the original criminal
cases under Rule 35, and to hold that the trial court's
rulings could not be appealed by the Government because
they did not come within the limited purview of the
Criminal Appeals Act.5 This reasoning the Court of Ap4 Rule 35 provides in pertinent part as follows: "The court may
correct an illegal sentence at any time."

peals declined to adopt, treating the motions instead as
having been brought under the provisions of 28 U. S. C.
§ 2255.
The court was correct in regarding Hill v. United States,
supra, as requiring this view, in the case of a prisoner in
custody under the sentence he is attacking. Cf. United
States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502. And in this area of the
law, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, "adjudication
upon the underlying merits of claims is not hampered by
reliance upon the titles petitioners put upon their documents." 301 F. 2d, at 378. See Heflin v. United States,
358 U. S. 415. Section 2255 explicitly authorizes a prisoner in custody under a sentence imposed by a federal
court to attack such a sentence collaterally upon the
ground that the sentence "was imposed in violation of
the . . . laws of the United States," by moving the trial
court "to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence." '
An action under 28 U. S. C. § 2255 is a separate proceeding, independent of the original criminal case. United
States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205. The Criminal Appeals
Act has no applicability to such a proceeding. Instead,
§ 2255 itself provides that "An appeal may be taken to
the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion
as from a final judgment on application for a writ of
habeas corpus."
availability of a writ of mandamus is presented by this case. See
United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469. Cf. United States v. Mayer,
235 U. S. 55.
6 The first paragraph of 28 U. S. C. § 2255 provides:
"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act
of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that
the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of
the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose
such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum
authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may
move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or
correct the sentence."

Opinion of the Court.

We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals, however,
that under this provision the Government had a right to
take appeals at the time it sought to do so in these cases,
because we think it clear that the orders were interlocutory, not final. For a federal prisoner § 2255 can perform the full service of habeas corpus, by effecting the
immediate and unconditional discharge of the prisoner.
Sanders v. United States, ante, p. 1. But the provisions of the statute make clear that in appropriate
cases a § 2255 proceeding can also be utilized to provide a more flexible remedy. In the present cases neither of the petitioners ever asked for his unconditional
release. What they asked, and were granted, was the
vacation of the sentences they were serving so that they
might be returned to the trial court to be resentenced in
proceedings in which their right to allocution would be
accorded them. Such a remedy is precisely authorized
by the statute. Under § 2255 a petitioner may "move
the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside
or correct the sentence."' '
And in response to such a
motion a District Court is expressly authorized to "discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial
or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate." S
See note 6, supra.
8 The third paragraph of § 2255 provides: "Unless the motion and

the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner
is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice therenf to be served
upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon,
determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law
with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was
rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not
authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that
there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional
rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside
and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new
trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate."

OCTOBER TERM, 1962.
Opinion of the Court.

373 U. S.

Where, as here, what was appropriately asked and appropriately granted was the resentencing of the petitioners, it is obvious that there could be no final
disposition of the § 2255 proceedings until the petitioners
were resentenced. Cf. Parr v. United States, 351 U. S.
513, 518.
The long-established rule against piecemeal appeals in
federal cases and the overriding policy considerations
upon which that rule is founded have been repeatedly
emphasized by this Court. See, e. g., DiBella v. United
States, 369 U. S. 121; Carrollv. United States, 354 U. S.
394; Cobbledick v. United'States, 309 U. S. 323. The
standards of finality to which the Court has adhered in
habeas corpus proceedings have been no less exacting.
See, e. g., Collins v. Miller, 252 U. S. 364. There the
Court said that the rule as to finality "requires that the
judgment to be appealable should be final not only as to
all the parties, but as to the whole subject-matter and as
to all the causes of action involved." 252 U. S., at 370.
The basic reason for the rule against piecemeal interlocutory appeals in the federal system is particularly apparent in the cases before us. Until the petitioners are
resentenced, it is impossible to know whether the Government will be able to show any colorable claim of prejudicial error. The District Court may, as before, sentence
the petitioners to the same 25 years' imprisonment; it
may place one or both of them on probation; it may
make some other disposition with respect to their sentences. But until the court acts, none of the parties to
this controversy will have had a final adjudication of his
claims by the trial court in these § 2255 proceedings.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is set aside, and
the cases are remanded to the District Court for the
Southern District of New York for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
