MARTINO v. MICHIGAN WINDOW CLEANING CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 21.

Argued October 8, 9, 1945.-Decided February 4, 1946.

Respondent corporation was engaged in washing windows within the

State of its incorporation under contracts with its customers. The
greater part of the work was done on premises used by its customers
in the production of goods for interstate commerce. Its employees
were required to work overtime and were not paid time and a half
except for hours worked in excess of 44 hours per week. This was
in accordance with bona fide agreements entered into with the labor
union of which its employees were members. In a suit to enjoin
violations of § 15 (a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and to recover for unpaid overtime compensation under § 16 (b) of the Act,
held:
1. Respondent's employees are engaged "in the production of
goods for [interstate] commerce" so as to bring them within the
coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Roland Electrical Co.
v. Walling, 326 U. S. 657. P. 176.
2. They are not exempt as employees of a "retail or service establishment" within the meaning of § 13 (a) (2) of the Act. Roland
Electrical Co. v. Walling, supra. P. 177.
3. The existence and observance of written agreements entered
into in good faith with the labor union of which the employees were
members, providing for overtime pay for fewer hours than required
by the Act, constitute no bar to the right of the employees to
recover under § 16 (b) of the Act. P. 177.
145 F. 2d 163, reversed.

Petitioner sued to enjoin violation of § 15 (a) of the
Fair Labor Standards Act and to recover under § 16 (b)
for unpaid overtime compensation. The district court
dismissed the complaint. 51 F. Supp. 505. The circuit
court of appeals affirmed. 145 F. 2d 163. This Court
granted certiorari. 325 U. S. 849. Reversed, p. 178.
Daniel D. Carmell argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief was Leon A. Cousens.

Opinion of the Court.

327 U. S.

Larry S. Davidow argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent.
Acting Solicitor General Judson, William S. Tyson,
Bessie Margolin and George M. Szabad filed a brief on
behalf of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor, as amicus
curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE BURTON

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The questions here are the same as those in Roland
Electrical Co. v. Walling, 326 U. S. 657. They are (1)
whether respondent's employees, under the facts of this
case, are engaged "in the production of goods for commerce" within the meaning of §§ 6 and 7 of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938 (52 Stat. 1060, 1062-1063, 29
U. S. C. §§ 206 and 207), and (2) whether, if so engaged,
they nevertheless are exempted from the Act because they
are engaged in a "retail or service establishment the
greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate
commerce" within the meaning of § 13 (a) (2). 29 U. S. C.
§ 213 (a) (2). As in the Roland Electrical Co. case, we
answer the first question in the affirmative and the second
in the negative. The respondent also urges as a defense
the written agreements which it had renewed from year to
year with its employees for a higher number of hours of
work per week, before paying overtime, than is prescribed
in the Act.
The petitioner sued the respondent in the District Court
of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan.
He sued for himself as a former employee of the respondent and also in a representative capacity for its other
employees similarly situated. He sought to enjoin the
respondent from violation of § 15 (a) (1), (2) and (3), 29
U. S. C. § 215 (a) (1), (2) and (3), of the Fair Labor

Opinion of the Court.

Standards Act of 1938, and to recover under § 16 (b) of
the Act' unpaid overtime compensation together with a
like sum as liquidated damages, a reasonable attorney's
fee and costs.
The district court heard the case on the pleadings, stipulations of fact and the petitioner's motion for summary
judgment, made several findings of law, ordered that the
petitioners recover nothing and dismissed the complaint.
51 F. Supp. 505. The circuit court of appeals affirmed
the dismissal. 145 F. 2d 163. This Court has granted a
writ of certiorari, 325 U. S. 849, because of divergence of
opinions among the circuit courts of appeals as to the
interpretation of § 13 (a) (2), and now decides this case
in favor of petitioners, upon principles stated in Roland
Electrical Co. v. Walling, supra.
The respondent, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business in Detroit, was engaged in washing
windows, painting and similar maintenance work. The
employees of the respondent were required in some instances to work longer than 42 hours per week subsequent
to October 24, 1939, and longer than 40 hours per week
subsequent to October 24, 1940, but were not paid time
1"SEC. 16 ...
"(b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 6 or
section 7 of this Act shall be liable to the employee or employees
affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional
equal amount as liquidated damages. Action to recover such liability
may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any
one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and
other employees similarly situated, or such employee or employees
may designate an agent or representative to maintain such action for
and in behalf of all employees similarly situated. The court in such
action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's fee.to be paid by the defendant,
and costs of the action." 52 Stat. 1069, 29 U. S. C. § 216 (b).

and a half except for hours worked in excess of 44 hours
per week.'
The work of the respondent and of its employees was
done within the State of Michigan and, for the most part,
on the premises of the respondent's customers. It consisted primarily of cleaning the windows for those customers, always under contracts between them and the
respondent. The greater part of this work was done on
windows on premises used by respondent's customers in
the production of goods for interstate commerce.' Under
the circumstances of this case the cleaning of the windows
of industrial plants by the employees of the respondent
is an occupation necessary to the production of the goods
produced in those plants.' If the services rendered in

(2) for a workweek longer than forty-two hours during the

Opinion of the Court.

this case had been rendered by employees of respondent's
customers engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce, those employees would have come under
the Act. Respondent's employees are not to be excluded
from such coverage merely because their employment to
do the same work was under independent contracts.
Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517, 524; WarrenBradshaw Co. v. Hall, 317 U. S. 88, 90.
The respondent was engaged almost exclusively in servicing customers for whom such services were necessary in
their production of goods for interstate commerce. This
took place in the midst of producing "the flow of goods
in commerce" intended to be covered by the Act. Accordingly, the respondent cannot be classified as a "retail or
service establishment" within the meaning of § 13 (a) (2),
which contemplates an establishment serving ultimate
consumers beyond the end of such "flow of goods in commerce." Roland ElectricalCo. v. Walling, supra.
Throughout this case, the respondent has urged as a
defense that, in good faith and from year to year, since
before 1939, it has entered into and renewed written agreements with the labor union of which petitioner and those
for whom this suit is brought were members. Some of
these agreements, renewed since the Act became effective,
applied to the periods here in question and required the
respondent to pay overtime for work done in excess of
44 hours a week. This requirement was fully observed.
The district court made a finding that the existence and
observance of such agreements constituted no bar to the
right of the employees to recover under § 16 (b) if the
Fair Labor Standards Act applied to the case and required
overtime pay for work done in excess of a lesser number

of hours per week than were stipulated in the agreements.
It was not necessary for the circuit court of appeals to
consider the effect of this agreement because, in its view,
the Act did not apply to the respondent's employees.
However, under the view which we take, the respondent
is entitled to a decision on this further defense. We agree
with the district court that the agreements cannot supersede the Act and are not a bar to this action. Cf. Brooklyn
Bank v. O'Neil, 324 U. S. 697, 707, et seq.
For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of
appeals is reversed and this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.

MABEE ET AL. V. WHITE PLAINS PUBLISHING CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK.

No. 57.

Argued December 5,1945.-Decided February 11, 1946.

1. The publisher of a daily newspaper with a circulation ranging from
9,000 to 11,000 copies, of which about one-half of one per cent regularly goes out of the State, is engaged in the production of goods
for interstate commerce within the meaning of the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938. Pp. 180, 184.
(a) The maxim de minimis has no application here, because Congress made no distinction on the basis of volume of business, but,
by § 15 (a) (1) of the Act, outlawed the shipment in interstate
commerce of "any goods in the production of which any employee
was employed in violation of" the overtime and minimum wage
requirements of the Act. P. 181.
(b) Though it be assumed that sporadic or occasional shipments
of insubstantial amounts of goods were not intended to be included
in that prohibition, there is no warrant for assuming that regular
shipments are to be included or excluded dependent on their size.
P. 181.
