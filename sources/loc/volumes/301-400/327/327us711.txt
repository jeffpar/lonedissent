as it did, Congress had power to legislate generally, unlimited by proof of the existence of the evils in each particular situation. Section 11 (b) (1) is not designed to
punish past offenders but to remove what Congress considered to be potential if not actual sources of evil. And

nothing in the Constitution prevents Congress from acting
in time to prevent potential injury to the national economy
from becoming a reality.

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 123.

Argued December 10, 1945.-Decided April 1, 1946.

1. The Assimilative Crimes Act penalizes, when committed within a
federal enclave, any act "which is not made penal by any laws of
Congress," but which is an offense under the law of the State in
which such enclave is located. The Arizona "statutory rape" law
fixes 18 as the age of consent. Section 279 of the Federal Criminal
Code, defining the crime of carnal knowledge, fixes 16 as the age
of consent. Held that the Assimilative Crimes Act did not make
the Arizona law applicable to the case of a married white man who,
within the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona, had sexual
intercourse with an unmarried Indian girl then over 16 but under
18 years of age. P. 7.18.
2. So held because (1) the very acts upon which conviction would
depend have been: made penal by the laws of Congress defining
adultery, and (2) the offense known toArizona as "statutory rape"
has been defined and prohibited by § 279 of the Criminal Code,
which section is not to be redefined and enlarged by application
to it of the Assimilative Crimes Act. P. 717.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case turns upon the applicability of the Assimilative Crimes Act, § 289 of the Criminal Code, 54 Stat. 234,
18 U. S. C. § 468, which reads:
"Whoever, within the territorial limits of any State,
organized Territory, or district, but within or upon
any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or
acquired, described in section 272 of the Criminal
Code (U. S. C., title 18, sec. 451),' shall do or omit the
doing of any act or thing which is not made penal by
any laws of Congress, but which if committed or
omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Terri"Sec. 272. The crimes and offenses defined in this chapter
[§§ 272-289, 18 U. S. C. §§ 451-468] shall be punished as herein
prescribed:

concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise
acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the State
in which the same shall be, for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal,
dockyard, or other needful building." (Italics supplied.) 35 Stat.

tory, or district in which such place is situated, by
the laws thereof in force on February 1, 1940, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting
the doing of such act or thing, would be penal, shall
be deemed guilty of a like offense and be subject to
a like punishment."
The petitioner, a married white man, was convicted in
the District Court of the United States for the District of
Arizona, of having had sexual intercourse in 1943, within
the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona, with
an unmarried Indian girl who was then over 16, but under
18, years of age. There was no charge or evidence of use
of force by the petitioner or of lack of consent by the girl.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment by
a divided court. We granted certiorari under § 240 (a)
of the Judicial Code because of the importance of the case
in interpreting the Assimilative Crimes Act.
It is not disputed that this Indian reservation is "reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and
under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof," 2
or that it is "Indian country" within the meaning of Rev.
Stat. §2145.' This means that many sections of the Federal Criminal Code apply to the reservation, including
not only the Assimilative Crimes Act, but also those
making penal the offenses Qf rape,' assault with intent to

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

The conviction cannot be sustained under the federal
definitions of rape or assault with intent to rape, because
the federal crime of rape carries with it the requirement
of proof of the use of force by the offender and of an absence of consent by the victim. Oliver v. United States,
230 F. 971. Neither of these elements was charged or
proved here. The federal crime of having carnal knowledge of a girl requires proof that she was under 16 years
of age at the time of the offense, whereas here the indictment charged merely that she was under 18 and the proof
tion in the State of Montana, by one person not an Indian of another
not an Indian. The effect of this went so far that, in 1902, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives reported that,
"As the law now stands . . . offenses committed by half-breeds or
white persons, whether upon an Indian'or other person, are not cognizable by the Federal courts and generally go unpunished. This
state of the law is causing serious conditions of disorder within these
Indian reservations." H. R. Rep. No. 2704, 57th Cong., 1st Sess.,
p. 1. After a cession of jurisdiction by the State and after being
memorialized to do so by the legislature of South Dakota, Congress,
in 1903, granted jurisdiction specifically to the courts of the United
States for the District of South Dakota over actions charging any
person with certain major crimes committed within any Indian reservation in that State. 32 Stat. 793; 35 Stat. 1151; 36 Stat. 1167; 18
U. S. C. § 549. This Court, however, in 1913, in Donnelly v. United
States, supra, at pp. 271-272, said: "Upon full consideration we are
satisfied that offenses committed by or against Indians are not within
the principle of the McBratney and Draper Cases. This was in effect
held, as to crimes committed by the Indians, in the Kagama Case,
118 U. S. 375, 383, . . . This same reason applies-perhaps a fortiori--with respect to crimes committed by white men against the
persons or property of the Indian tribes while occupying reservations
set apart for the very purpose of segregating them from the whites
and others not of Indian blood." We find no material special legislation on this subject affecting Arizona except its Enabling Act. 36
Stat. 568, 572. That Act contains provisions similar to those applicable to Montana, considered in Draper v. United States, supra, and
to those applicable to New Mexico, considered in United States v.

showed that she was between 16 and 18. While the indictment did not state whether or not the petitioner was an
Indian or whether or not he was married, the undisputed
evidence showed that he was a married white man.
However, the offense charged comes within the statutory definition of "rape" in § 43-4901 of the Arizona
Code.1' That section expands the crime of "statutory
rape" so as to include sexual intercourse with a girl under
18 instead of merely with a girl under 16. Accordingly,
"IArizona's definition of rape and the punishment that Arizona
prescribes for its commission differ from those relating either to rape
or carnal knowledge under the Federal Criminal Code. These differences well illustrate the confusing variations from the definition
of a federal crime and from provisions for its punishment which would
have to be considered if indictments were permitted under the Assimilative Crimes Act for every act committed within a federal
enclave and which might come within a State's enlargement of the
federal definition of the same offense. Section 43-4901 of the Arizona
Code of 1939 provides:
"Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female,
not the wife of the perpetrator, under any of the following circumstances:
"Where the female is under the age of eighteen [18] years;
"Where she is incapable, through lunacy or any other unsoundness
of mind, whether temporary or permanent, of giving legal consent;
"Where she resists, but her resistance is overcome by force or
violence;
"Where she is prevented from resisting by threats of immediate
and great bodily harm, accompanied by apparent power of execution,
or by any intoxicating, narcotic, or anaesthetic substance, administered by or with the privity of the accused;
"Where she is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act,
and this is known to the accused;
"Where she submits, under a belief that the person committing the
act is her husband, and this belief is induced by any artifice, pretense
or concealment practiced by the accused, with intent to induce such
belief . ..
"Rape is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or
for any term of years not less than five [5]."

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES.

717

Opinion of the Court.

the question here is whether or not the Assimilative Crimes
Act makes this section applicable to Indian reservations
in Arizona. The question extends not only to the definition of the offense but also to the punishment prescribed.
The Arizona Code fixes the punishment for its violation
in those instances where violations would not come within
§ 279 of the Federal Criminal Code. Under those circumstances, on an Indian reservation in Arizona, the statutory
punishment, fixed by § 279 of the Federal Criminal Code,
for a man, not an Indian, who had carnal knowledge of an
Indian girl under 16, would be imprisonment for not more
than 15 years for the first offense and not more than 30
years for a subsequent offense, with no minimum sentence
specified. On the same facts, except that the girl be between 16 and 18, the punishment, fixed by the Arizona
Code, would be imprisonment for life or for any term not
less than five years. This would impose a more stringent
range of punishment, including the minimum sentence of
five years imposed in this case, upon what Congress in its
Criminal Code evidently had treated as a lesser offense.
We hold that the Assimilative Crimes Act does not make
the Arizona statute applicable in the present case because
(1) the precise acts upon which the conviction depends
have been made penal by the laws of Congress defining
adultery " and (2) the offense known to Arizona as that
of "statutory rape" 13 has been defined and prohibited by
the Federal Criminal Code, 4 and is not to be redefined and
enlarged by application to it of the Assimilative Crimes
Act. The fact that the definition of this offense as enacted
by Congress results in a narrower scope for the offense than
that given to it by the State, does not mean that the con12

gressional definition must give way to the State definition.
This is especially clear in the present case because the specified acts which would come within the additional scope
given to the offense by the State through its postponement
of the age of consent of the victim from 16 to 18 years
of age, are completely covered by the federal crimes of
adultery or fornication.' The interesting legislative history of the Assimilative Crimes Act '" discloses nothing to
indicate that, after Congress has once defined a penal offense, it has authorized such definition to be enlarged by
the application to it of a State's definition of it. It has
not even been suggested that a conflicting State definition
could give a narrower scope to the offense than that given
to it by Congress. We believe that, similarly, a conflicting State definition does not enlarge the scope of the offense
defined by Congress. The Assimilative Crimes Act has
a natural place to fill through its supplementation of the
Federal Criminal Code, without giving it the added effect
of modifying or repealing existing provisions of the Federal
Code.
Where offenses have been specifically defined by Congress and the public has been guided by such definitions
for many years, it is not natural for Congress by general
legislation to amend such definitions or the punishments
prescribed for such offenses, without making clear its intent to do so."' On the other hand, it is natural for Con15See notes 7 and 8, supra.

Opinion of the Court.

gress from time to time, through renewals of the Assimilative Crimes Act, to use local statutes to fill in gaps in the
Federal Criminal Code where no action of Congress has
been taken to define the missing offenses.
That the attorneys for the Government have recognized
the force of some of these considerations is apparent from
the following statement at the close of their brief:
"Congress, of course, was free to fix policy for areas of
federal jurisdiction even though it might conflict with
local policy, and we think it has done so in respect
of the instant situation. These considerations, we
think, outweigh the considerations in support of the
judgment of the court below."
The first Federal Crimes Act, approved April 30, 1790,
1 Stat. 112, dealt primarily with subjects over which the
Constitution had expressly given jurisdiction to the Federal Government. For example, it dealt with treason,
crimes upon the high seas and counterfeiting of securities
of the United States. In so far as it related to federal
enclaves, it recognized and provided punishment for the
offenses of "wilful murder" and manslaughter if committed "within any fort, arsenal, dock-yard, magazine, or
to repeal a previous particular act, unless there is some express refer-

,ence to the previous legislation on the subject, or unless there is a

necessary inconsistency in the two acts standing together.' 'And
the reason is,' said Wood, V. C., in Fitzgerald v. Champenys, 30 L. J.
N. S. Eq. 782; 2 Johns. and Hem. 31-54, 'that the legislature having
had its attention directed to a special subject, and having observed
all the circumstances of the case and provided for them, does not
intend by a general enactment afterwards to derogate from its own

act when it makes no special mention of its intention so to do.'"
In Franklinv. United States, 216 U. S. 559, 568, in referring to the
Assimilative Crimes Act, it was said, "by this act Congress adopted
for the government of the designated places,. . . the criminal laws

.then existing in the several' States within which such places were

situated, in so far as aaid law8 were',not.'displaced by'specific laws
enacted by Congress." (Italics supplied.)

and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States . . ." § 3,
1 Stat. 113. It contained nothing corresponding directly
to the Assimilative Crimes Act. 8
On February 10, 1823, James Buchanan, then serving
his first term in the House of Representatives, clearly
stated the need for the recognition of additional federal
crimes. He secured the adoption of a Resolution "That
the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire
whether there be any, and, if any, what, crimes not now
punishable by law, to which punishments ought to be
affixed." Annals of Congress, 17th Cong., 2d Sess. (18221823) 929.19
18 Its nearest approach to an Assimilative Crimes Act was in its
definition of piracies. It provided in § 8 that "if any person or persons shall commit upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, basin or
bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, murder or robbery,
or any other offence which if committed within the body of a county,
would by the laws of the United States be punishable with death; . . .
every such offender shall be deemed, taken and adjudged to be a pirate
and felon, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer death; . .. "
1 Stat. 113. This corresponds to the plan in certain English statutes
(e. g. 28 Henry VIII, c. 15 (1536); 39 George III, c. 37 (1799)) for
supplementing their Maritime Law with "other offenses" known to the
common law. There was no attempt to enlarge the definitions of
existing crimes under the Maritime Law by cross reference to broader
definitions under the common law. When the Assimilative Crimes
Act later appeared in the Federal Criminal Code, it followed this
general form of statement.
19 "In offering this resolution, Mr. B. said, it had been decided that
the courts of the United States had no power to punish any act, no
matter how criminal in its nature, unless Congress have declared it
to be a crime, and annexed a punishment to its perpetration. Offences
at the common law, not declared such by acts of Congress, are therefore not within the range of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.
Congress have annexed punishments but to a very few crimes, and
those all of an aggravated nature. The consequence is, that a great
variety of actions, to which a high degree of moral guilt is attached,

In the second session of the next Congress, 20 Daniel
Webster, Chairman of the Committee of the Judiciary of
the House of Representatives, sponsored the bill which
became the Federal Crimes Act of March 3, 1825. After
extended debate,"' Congress expanded the list of enumerated federal crimes. It also added the § 3 which became
the basis of the Assimilative Crimes Act of today:
".. . if any offence shall be committed in any of the
places aforesaid,2' the punishment of which offence
is not specially provided for by any law of the United
States, such offence shall, upon a conviction in any
court of the United States having cognisance thereof,
be liable to, and receive the same punishment as the
laws of the state in which such fort, dock-yard, navyyard, arsenal, armory, or magazine, or other place,
ceded as aforesaid, is situated, provide for the like
offence when committed within the body of any
county of such state." 4 Stat. 115.
and which are punished as crimes at the common law, and by every
State in the Union, may be committed with impunity on the high
seas, and in any place where Congress' has exclusive jurisdiction. To
afford an example: An assault and battery, with intent to commit
murder, may be perpetrated, either on the high seas, or in a fort,
magazine, arsenal, or dockyard, belonging to the United States, and
there exists no law to punish such an offence.

and it is astonishing that none has ever yet been supplied." Annals

This was amended in 1866, 14 Stat. 13, and in 1874 it
was incorporated in the Revised Statutes as § 5391 in
substantially its then existing form. For many years it
thus referred to an "offense" which is not prohibited or the
punishment of which "is not specially provided for, by
any law of the United States . . ." I A similar provision
was enacted in 1898 in 30 Stat. 717. In 1909, however,
in codifying the Federal Criminal Code, this section was
slightly changed when it was incorporated in that Code
as § 289 in substantially its present form. The word
"offense" was changed so as to avoid the use of it as referring to an action which had not been prohibited and,
therefore, technically could not be an "offense." Possibly
this change of the old phrase into the phrase "any act or
thing which is not made penal by any laws of Congress"
led to the present attempt to interpret it in a specific
sense as referring to individual acts of the parties rather
than in a generic sense referring to acts of a general type
or kind. The new words, in the light of the Congressional
Committee's explanation of them,24 cannot, however, be
28 "If any offense be committed in any place which has been or may
hereafter be, ceded to and under the jurisdiction of the United States,
which offense is not prohibited, or the punishment thereof is not
specifically provided for, by any law of the United States, such offense
shall be liable to, and receive, the same punishment as the laws of the
State in which such place is situated, now in force, provide for the like
offense when committed within the jurisdiction of such State; and no
subsequent repeal of any such State law shall affect any prosecution for
such offense in any court of the United States." Rev. Stat. § 5391.
24 The Committee's statement as to the new section was:
"Section 5391, Revised Statutes, provides that if any 'offense' be
committed, etc., which 'offense' is not prohibited or punished by any
law of Congress, such 'offense' shall receive the same punishment as is
attached thereto by the law of the State within which the place upon
which it is committed is situated.

which no penalty is attached in no legal sense can be denominated an

regarded as changing the scope of the Act so substantially
as to make it amend and enlarge the definition of an existing federal offense as well as to cover the case where an
"offense" had not been prohibited. To do so would be
contrary to the expressed purpose of the Committee to
continue, rather than to change, its original meaning. In
the instant case not only has the generic act been covered

by the definition of having carnal knowledge, but the
specific acts have been made "penal" by the definition of

adultery. The subsequent amendments " have been made
merely to advance the dates as of which the assimilated
local statutes must have been in force. The last amend-

ment, in 1940, followed an explanation of the bill in
identical letters from the Attorney General to the Speaker
of the House of Representatives and to the Chairman of
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. These letters
adopted the view that the Act was to cover crimes on which
Congress had not legislated and did not suggest that the
Act was to enlarge or otherwise amend definitions of
crimes already contained in the Federal Code."8

Opinion of the Court.

327 U. S.

As to the particular offense involved in this case, the
legislative history shows an increasing purpose by Congress to cover rape and all related offenses fully with penal
legislation. In the Federal Crimes Act of 1825, 4 Stat.
115, rape was prohibited and made punishable only within
certain areas under the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. In the same Act, the assimilative crimes section was applied to federal enclaves. 27 It

the Assimilative Crimes Act. A contrary intent of Congress has been made obvious. Congress repeatedly has
increased its list of specific prohibitions of related offenses
and has enlarged the areas within which those prohibitions are applicable. It has covered the field with uniform

the facts of this.case. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals accordingly is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE concurs in the result.

the age was

changed their laws. A number of the States have fixed the age of
sixteen. Some of them have fixed as high as eighteen. Mississippi,
Colorado, and Alabama have fixed as high as eighteen." 19 Cong.
