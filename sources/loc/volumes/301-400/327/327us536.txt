business of the Commission, made such by the very terms
of the statute. The function of the reviewing court is
much more restricted. It is limited to ascertaining
whether there is warrant in the law and the facts for what
the Commission has done. Unless in some specific respect
there has been prejudicial departure from requirements
of the law or abuse of the Commission's discretion, the
reviewing court is without authority to intervene. It cannot substitute its own view concerning what should be
done, whether with reference to competitive considerations or others, for the Commission's judgment upon
matters committed to its determination, if that has support in the record and the applicable law.
The judgment is
Reversed.

CHERRY COTTON MILLS, INC. v.
UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 187.

Argued December 14, 1945.-Decided March 25, 1946.

1. Under 28 U. S. C. 250 (2) giving the Court of Claims jurisdiction
to hear and determine "All set-offs, counterclaims . .. or other
demands whatsoever on the part of the Government . . . against
any claimant against the Government in said Court," it is within
the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, in a suit against the Government for a refund of taxes, to hear and determine a counterclaim of
the Government based upon a debt owed by claimant to the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation. P. 539.
2. That Congress chose to call the R. F. C. a corporation does not
alter its characteristics so as to make it something other than it

actually is, an agency selected by the Government to accomplish
purely governmental purposes, notwithstanding the fact that, in
other situations and with relation to other statutes, this Court has
applied the doctrine of governmental immunity or priority rather
strictly. P. 539.
3. The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to hear and determine
counterclaims is in no way dependent upon the preliminary intragovernmental steps which precede court action-such as directions
issued by the General Accounting Office to the Treasury. P. 538.
103 Ct. Cls. 243, 59 F. Supp. 122, affirmed.
Petitioner sued the Government for a tax refund in the
Court of Claims. The Government filed a counterclaim
for a debt owed by petitioner to the R. F. C. The Court
of Claims overruled a challenge of its jurisdiction under
28 U. S. C. 250 (2) and rendered judgment for the United
States and against petitioner for the amount it owed the
R. F. C. less the amount of the tax refund. 103 Ct. Cls.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1942 the Government owed the petitioner a $3,104.87
refund of processing and floor taxes paid by the petitioner
under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The petitioner
owed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation $5,963.51,
balance on a note for borrowed money. The General Accounting Office directed the Treasury not to pay the tax
refund to the petitioner, but to issue a check for the refund payable to the R. F. C. "to partially liquidate" petitioner's indebtedness to that governmental agency. As

authorized by 28 U. S. C. 250 (1), the petitioner then
brought suit against the Government for the tax refund in
the Court of Claims. The Government filed a counterclaim for the $5,963.51, asserting the right to do so under
28 U. S. C. 250 (2), which gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear and determine "All set-offs, counterclaims,
โข . . or other demands whatsoever on the part of the
Government of the United States against any claimant
against the Government in said court . . ." The petitioner challenged the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims
to hear and determine the counterclaim on these two
grounds: (1) the Comptroller exceeded his authority in
directing the Treasury to pay the tax refund to the R. F. C.
instead of to the petitioner; (2) the R. F. C. should be
treated in the same way as a privately owned corporation
and when so treated the petitioner's admittedly valid indebtedness to R. F. C. is not a claim "on the part of the
Government" entitling it to set up a counterclaim under
28 U. S. C. 250 (2). The Court of Claims, rejecting both
these contentions, rendered judgment for the United
States and against the petitioner for the amount it owed
the R. F. C. less the amount of the tax refund. We
granted certiorari.
Little need be said as to the contention concerning the
alleged lack of authority of the General Accounting Office
to direct the Treasury not to pay the petitioner, since
we agree with the Court of Claims that its jurisdiction to
hear and determine counterclaims is in no way dependent
upon the preliminary intragovernmental steps which precede court action. For this reason the petitioner's argument based on our decision in Skinner & Eddy Corp. v.
McCarl, 275 U. S. 1, where we considered the power of the
Comptroller General in relation to wholly different legislation, has no bearing on the power of the Court of Claims
under 28 U. S. C. 250 (2).

CHERRY COTTON MILLS v. U. S.
536

Opinion of the Court.

Nor do we find any justification for giving to 250 (2)
the narrow interpretation urged. Its purpose was to permit the Government, when sued in the Court of Claims,
to have determined in a single suit all questions which
involved mutual obligations between the Government and
a claimant against it. Legislation of this kind has long
been favored and encouraged because of a belief that it
accomplishes among other things such useful purposes as
avoidance of "circuity of action, inconvenience, expense,
consumption of the courts' time, and injustice." Chicago
& N. W. R. Co. v. Lindell, 281 U. S. 14, 17 and cases
cited.
We have no doubt but that the set-off and counterclaim
jurisdiction of the Court of Claims was intended to permit
the Government to have adjudicated in one suit all controversies between it and those granted permission to sue
it, whether the Government's interest had been entrusted
to its agencies of one kind or another. Every reason that
could have prompted Congress to authorize the Government to plead counterclaims for debts owed to any of its
other agencies applies with equal force to debts owed to the
R. F. C. Its Directors are appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Senate; its activities are all aimed at accomplishing a public purpose; all of its money comes from
the Government; its profits, if any, go to the Government;
its losses the Government must bear. That the Congress
chose to call it a corporation does not alter its characteristics so as to make it something other than what it actually is, an agency selected by Government to accomplish
purely governmental purposes. Inland Waterways Corp.
v. Young, 309 U. S. 517, 524. Nor is this congressionally
granted power to plead a counterclaim to be reduced
because in other situations, and with relation to other
statutes, we have applied the doctrine of governmental

immunity or priority rather strictly.1 The Government
here sought neither immunity nor priority. Its right to
counterclaim rests on different principles, one of which
was graphically expressed by the sponsors of the Act of
which ยง 250 (2) is a part: It is "as much the duty of the
citizen to pay the Government as it is the duty of the

Government to pay the citizen." 58 Cong. Globe 1674,
April 15, 1862, 37th Cong., 2d Sess.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 435. Argued February 27, 28, 1946.-Decided March 25, 1946.
The Maritime Commission Price Adjustment Board notified respondent that it had been assigned to renegotiate respondent's war contracts with the Commission pursuant to the Renegotiation Act and
requested respondent to attend an initial conference and to supply
information. Respondent denied the Board's authority on the
ground that its contracts were with a British ministry and not with
the Maritime Commission. The Board replied that, although signed
by a British ministry, they had been negotiated by the Maritime
Commission on behalf of the United States, which was responsible
for the obligations incurred, and that, therefore, they were subject
to renegotiation. Respondent refused to furnish the information
requested and brought suit in a district court for a declaratory
judgment that the contracts were not subject to the Renegotiation
