ET AL.,

TRUSTEES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 392.

Argued January 4, 1946.-Decided February 4, 1946.

1. Petitioner, owner of a substantial number of shares of stock in a
corporation, filed on behalf of the corporation a claim (in the nature
of a derivative suit) against a debtor in reorganization proceedings
under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. Subsequently a petition of the
corporation for reorganization under § 77 was filed and approved,
and a trustee was appointed. Held:
(a) The bankruptcy court should allow the claim to be amended
by joining the corporation or its trustee. P. 172.
. (b) If prosecution of the claim will be inconsistent
with the plan
of reorganization of the corporation or the administration of its
affairs, the claim should be disallowed; if not, then the claim should
be considered on its merits. P. 172.
2. The "exclusive jurisdiction" granted the reorganization court by
§ 77 (a) is that which bankruptcy courts. have customarily possessed; and the title and powers of the trustee are by § 77 (c) (2)
assimilated to those of trustees in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. P. 164.
3. So far as enforcement of claims is concerned, there is no indication
that Congress adopted a different rule in proceedings under § 77
than had long obtained in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. P.
164.
4. Litigation commenced by or on behalf of a corporation may not
be defeated by supervening proceedings for reorganization of the
corporation under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. P. 165.
5. The trustee, being in a position to take control of the litigation by
reason of the fact that the cause of action has become a part of the
estate, should have the opportunity to make the choice-of permitting the suit to continue without interference; of intervening
in it; of starting a new suit; or of causing the suit to be abatedwhich is most advantageous to the estate. P. 167.
6. Since the claim in this case was filed before the petition of the
corporation for reorganization under § 77 was approved, that event
should have no different effect on the claim than it would have had
on a suit which had been previously instituted by or on behalf of
the:corporation. P. 169

7. Where a claim on behalf of a corporation is filed in a reorganization proceeding, the necessary and proper procedure is for the reorganization court to summon in the corporation or its trustee, so
that all parties will be bound by any order which is entered on the
merits. P. 170.
8. Continuation of the prosecution of the claim by the petitioner
might be wholly compatible with the disposition of the claim by
the reorganization court or with the administration of the estate.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner is the owner of a substantial number of
shares of stock of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway
Company. In April 1934 he filed a claim for the benefit
of St. Louis Southwestern in the bankruptcy proceedings
which previously had been instituted under § 77 of the
Bankruptcy Act (49 Stat. 911, 11 U. S. C. § 205) for the
reorganization of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific
Railway Co. The claim filed was a claim for a cause of
action which St. Louis Southwestern allegedly had against
the Rock Island. It amounted to many millions of dollars and arose out of an alleged conspiracy between the
Rock Island and others to control the St. Louis Southwestern to their own interest, in breach of their fiduciary
relationship to St. Louis Southwestern, and in violation

Opinion of the Court.

of the antitrust laws. It was stated in the claim that a
demand on the board of directors of St. Louis Southwestern to file the claim was not made because it would be
futile, the dominant stockholder and the directors of St.
Louis Southwestern being parties to the conspiracy. In
May 1935 the trustees of Rock Island objected to the
claim by general denial. In December 1935-about a
year and a half after the claim had been filed-St. Louis
Southwestern filed a petition for reorganization under
§ 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. Shortly thereafter the petition was approved and a trustee was appointed. Thereupon the trustees of Rock Island further objected to the
claim filed by petitioner on the ground that all causes of
action belonging to St. Louis Southwestern had become
vested in its bankruptcy trustee and could no longer be
asserted in the Rock Island proceeding by petitioner.
The claim was referred to a special master who, in February 1942, filed his report, concluding that petitioner
should not be allowed to prosecute the claim. Two years
later the district court approved the special master's report and disallowed the claim. On appeal the circuit
court of appeals affirmed. 149 F. 2d 529. The case is
here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted
because the problem presented is an important one in
bankruptcy law.
The circuit court of appeals held that a stockholders'
derivative suit commenced before the corporation's petition under § 77 had been approved could not be continued
thereafter without permission of the reorganization court.
It relied on the provisions of § 77 which gave the reorganizing court exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its
property' and which give a trustee appointed in those
§ 77 (a) provides in part:

"If the petition is so approved, the court in which such order is
entered shall, during the pendency of the proceedings under this
section and for the purposes thereof, have exclusive jurisdiction
of the debtor and its property wherever located, and shall have

proceedings the title and powers of, other bankruptcy
trustees.' But the exclusive jurisdiction granted the reorganization court by § 77 (a) is that which bankruptcy
courts have customarily possessed.' And the title and
powers of the trustee are by § 77 (c) (2) assimilated to
those of trustees in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings.
Certainly, so far as the enforcement of claims is concerned, there is no indication that Congress adopted a
different rule in proceedings under § 77 than had long obtained in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. Yet, if the
view of the circuit court of appeals were followed, any
suit which had been brought by the corporation before its
petition under § 77 had been approved would be defeated
when that event happened. That is not the rule in ordiand may exercise in addition to the powers conferred by this section all the powers, not inconsistent with this section, which a
Federal court would have had if it had appointed a receiver in
equity of the property of the debtor for any purpose. Process
of the court shall extend to and be valid when served in any
judicial district."
§ 77 (1) provides:
'In proceedings under this section and consistent with the
provisions thereof; the jurisdiction and powers of the court, the
duties of the debtor and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and
of all persons with respect to the debtor and its property, shall
be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been
filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day
when the debtor's petition was filed."
2 § 77 (c) (2) provides in part:
"The trustee or trustees so appointed, upon filing such bond, shall
have all the title and shall exercise, subject to the control of the
judge and consistently with the provisions of this section, all of
the powers of a trustee appointed pursuant to section 44 of this
Act or any other section of this Act, and, to the extent not inconsistent with this section, if authorized by the judge, the powers
of a receiver in an equity proceeding . . ."

change in the law to write that rule into § 77.
Litigation instituted by a creditor may not be defeated
merely by reason of the fact that he has become a bankrupt. Thatcherv. Rockwell, 105 U. S. 467, 469-470. Title
to the claim vests, of course, in the bankruptcy trustee.
He is in position to take control of the litigation. He may,
as indicated in Johnson v. Collier, 222 U. S. 538, 540, start
a new suit ' and cause the old one to be abated, or intervene in the old one ' and obtain such benefits as it affords.! The choice may indeed be a valuable one. Rights
might be lost if the earlier suit were abated. And the
speculative nature of the litigation or the expense involved
might indicate to the trustee that it was more provident
for him not to intervene in the existing suit, nor to institute a new one, but to let the one which had been started

Sec. 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, 52 Stat. 879, 11 U. S. C. § 110.
The same is true under § 77 by reason of the provision in § 77 (c) (2),
supra note 2.
5 Sec. 11 (e) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 29 (e), authorizes
a receiver or trustee, within two years subsequent to the adjudication
or within such further period of time as federal or state law permits,
to institute proceedings in behalf of the estate upon any claim against
which the statute of limitations had not expired at the time of the
filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
This provision is applicable to proceedings under § 77 by reason of
§ 77 (1), set forth in supranote 1.
1 Sec. 11 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 52 Stat. 849, 11 U. S. C. § 29
(c), provides that "A receiver or trustee may, with the approval of
the court, be permitted to prosecute as receiver or trustee any suit
commenced by the bankrupt prior to the adjudication, with like force
and effect as though it had been commenced by him." This provision is likewise applicable to proceedings under § 77 (1), supra

run its course.' As stated in Johnson v. Collier, supra,
p. 540,
"If, because of the disproportionate expense, or
uncertainty as to the result, the trustee neither sues
nor intervenes, there is no reason why the bankrupt
himself should not continue the litigation. He has
an interest in making the dividend for creditors as
large as possible, and in some States the more direct
interest of creating a fund which may be set apart
to him as an exemption. If the trustee will not sue
and the bankrupt cannot sue, it might result in the
bankrupt's debtor being discharged of an actual liability. The statute indicates no such purpose, and if
money or property is finally recovered, it will be for
the benefit of the estate. Nor is there any merit in
the suggestion that this might involve a liability to
pay both the bankrupt and the trustee. The defendant in any such suit can, by order of the bankrupt
court, be amply protected against any danger of being
made to pay twice." 9
If the suit is continued by the bankrupt, the trustee is concluded
by the judgment. Eyster v. Gaff, 91 U. S. 521, 524-525; Paradisev.
Vogtlandische Maschinen-Fabrik,supra note 7, p. 55.
9As stated in Van der Stegen v. Neuss, Hesslein & Co., 270 N. Y.
55, 59-60, 200 N. E. 577:
"Again, the trustee in bankruptcy is not obliged to maintain
or continue every cause of action which the bankrupt may have.
He is not bound to accept burdensome property nor unprofitable
contracts (Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Hurley, 153 Fed.
Rep. 503; affd., 213 U. S. 126), nor is he obliged to intervene
in any action pending by or against the bankrupt. (Kessler v.
Herklotz, 132 App. Div. 278; Fleming v. Courtenay, 98 Me.
401.) If a trustee does not take up the prosecution of a suit
the defendant is not released even where the right of action
is one that might have passed to the trustee. The bankrupt
may continue the prosecution of the action. (Griffin v. Mutual
Life Ins. Co., 119 Ga. 664.) The relationship, therefore, between the bankrupt and his trustee is for one and the same
purpose-to get out of the bankrupt's property and claims enough
money to pay his debts and to relieve the bankrupt, through
his discharge, from further responsibility."
8

MEYER v. FLEMING.
161

Opinion of the Court.

The same rule obtains in equity receiverships."
We see no reason why there should be a different rule
in the case of stockholders' derivative suits. They are
likewise suits to enforce a corporate claim. They are one
of the remedies which equity designed for those situations
where the management through fraud, neglect of duty or
other cause declines to take the proper and necessary steps
to assert the rights which the corporation has.11 The
stockholders are then allowed to take the initiative and
institute the suit which the management should have
started had it performed its duty. The corporation is
a necessary party. Davenport v. Dows, 18 Wall. 626.
Hence, it is joined as a defendant. But it is only nominally a defendant, since any judgment obtained against
the real defendant runs in its favor. The reasons of policy
for holding that ordinary suits to enforce a corporate claim
are not abated when the corporation is adjudged a bankrupt or when a receiver is appointed are equally applicable
here. The claim sought to be enforced in a derivative
suit may be an important asset of the estate. It might
be lost to the estate through the operation of statutes of
limitations, if the trustee or receiver were required to start
anew. As in case of ordinary suits to enforce corporate
claims, he should be allowed a choice to let the suit continue under the stockholders' auspices; 12 to intervene in
it; 1 to start a new suit; or, in case he deems it more provi:1 See Missouri, K. & T. Trust Co. v. German National Bank, 77

dent from the point of view of the estate to make a settlement of the claim or to reserve it for the reorganized company, to cause it to be abated. 4 He might conclude that
the more provident course was to let the suit continue
without interference. 5 That decision might be dictated
by the speculative nature of the suit and the expense involved, as Johnsonv. Collier,supra,indicates. If the trustee will not sue and the stockholder cannot continue with
the litigation, what might turn out to be a valuable claim
might be lost to the estate, not only through the operation
of statutes of limitations, but in cases like the present
through a discharge of the debtor. 6 The point is that
the trustee or receiver, being in a position to take control
of the litigation by reason of the fact that the cause of
action has become a part of the estate, should have the opportunity to make the choice which is most advantageous
to the estate. Cf. Thompson v. MagnoliaPetroleum Co.,
309 U. S. 478, 483. The fact that the corporation is nominally a defendant should not lead to any different result.'
That gives the suit only a difference in form, not a difference in substance.
14 Moreover, the stockholder's suit might so intimately affect the
administration of the bankruptcy or receivership estate as to require
that it be continued only under the auspices of the trustee or receiver.
See Adler v. Seaman, 266 F. 828, 835-837; Seaman v. McCulloch, 8 F.
2d 820, 825-826.

Lembeck, 97 N. J. Eq. 361, 127 A. 197.
16 Sec. 77 (f) provides for the discharge of the'debtor "from its
debts and liabilities, except such as may consistently with the provisions of the plan be reserved . . ."
1, But see Coyle v. Skirvin, 124 F. 2d 934, 937-938 (receivership).
The provision in § 77 (j) empowering the court to "enjoin or stay the
commencement or continuation of suits against the debtor until after
final decree" obviously relates to suits where claims are asserted
against the debtor, not where the debtor is made a nominal defendant
for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in its favor.

MEYER v. FLEMING.
161

Opinion of the Court.

We have in the present case not a stockholders' derivative suit filed before the bankruptcy of his corporation,
but a claim filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of the
alleged debtor (Rock Island) by a stockholder on behalf
of his corporation, St. Louis Southwestern. If the claim
were to be filed after the petition for the reorganization of
St. Louis Southwestern had been approved, it could be
done only with the consent of the bankruptcy court. For
it has exclusive. authority to determine how causes of
action which have become a part of the bankruptcy estate
shall be enforced. See Porter v. Sabin, 149 U. S. 473;
Klein v. Peter, 284 F. 797. But since the claim was filed
before the petition of St. Louis Southwestern under § 77
had been approved, no reason is apparent why that event
should have a different effect on the claim than it would
have had on a suit which had been previously instituted
by or on behalf of the corporation. Indeed, the facts of
this case emphasize the reason for giving the trustee an
opportunity to choose what course to take. The claim
was filed in April 1934, a year and a half prior to the time
when the petition of St. Louis Southwestern under § 77
had been approved. We are told that the time for filing
of claims against the Rock Island expired over eleven
years ago. If the claim were now disallowed, the trustee
of St. Louis Southwestern, if he desired to assert it, would
be faced with the task of obtaining leave to file out of
time. 8 There is, therefore, the same reason for allowing
18 Sec. 77 (c) (7) provides that the judge "shall promptly determine
and fix a reasonable time within which the claims of creditors may be
filed or evidenced and after which no claim not so filed or evidenced
may participate except on order for cause shown . . ." This is the
equity rule (5 Collier on Bankruptcy (1944) p. 537) which permits
the filing of claims out of time provided the claim is equitable, the
claimant is not chargeable with laches, and the assets have not been
distributed (see Conklin v. United States ShipbuildingCo., 136 F. 1006,
1009-1010; Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City R. Co., 198 F.
721, 740-742); and provided further that the late filing does not unduly delay the proceedings. Guaranty Trust Co. v. Henwood, 86 F.

the estate to obtain the benefits of the claim which has
been filed, as there would be for allowing the trustee the
opportunity to take over a stockholders' derivative suit
previously instituted.
It is said, however, that the claim was properly disallowed because the corporation on whose behalf the claim
was filed was not before the court. As we have said, the
corporation is a necessary party in a stockholders' derivative suit. Davenport v. Dows, supra. It can be joined
as a party and brought in by summons in the usual way.
But the filing of a claim in bankruptcy is not the institution of a plenary suit. It is a claim against assets in the
hands of the bankruptcy court, not an action in personam.
The absence of the corporation is a proper basis for an
objection to the claim. But there is no way available to
the stockholder to join it in the claim other than by moving
the bankruptcy court to bring it in. The bankruptcy
court has that power.19 The objections to the present
claim, however, were not based on the absence before the
court of St. Louis Southwestern or its trustee." But
whether such an objection was made or not, the proper
and necessary procedure. for the bankruptcy court is to
summon in the corporation or its trustee so that all parties
19 Sec. 2 (a) (6) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 11 (a) (6)
grants the court power to "Bring in and substitute additional persons
or parties in proceedings under this title when necessary for the complete determination of a matter in controversy." See 1 Collier on
Bankruptcy (14 ed., 1940), pp. 214-218.
20 One of the grounds on which the special master based his recommendation for disallowance of the claim was that the claim was improperly filed in the first instance, since the corporation was not made
a party. But the district court, like the circuit court of appeals,
proceeded on the ground that the claim could no longer be prosecuted
after approval of the petition for the reorganization of St. Louis
Southwestern unless the bankruptcy court in that proceeding expressly authorized it.

will be bound by any order which is entered on the
merits.'
It is said, however, that by reason of events which have
transpired since St. Louis Southwestern filed its petition
for reorganization under § 77, the claim which Meyer filed
in the Rock Island reorganization proceedings was properly disallowed. In the first place, it appears that a
reorganization plan for the St. Louis Southwestern has
been approved by the district court. In re St. Louis
Southwestern R. Co., 53 F. Supp. 914. The Interstate
Commerce Commission, in preparing the plan, investigated Meyer's charges and concluded that they had no
substantial support. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. Reorganization,249 I. C. C. 5, 46-149; 252 I. C. C. 325, 330337. It refused to recommend that the cause of action
be reserved in the plan of reorganization. 252 I. C. C.,
pp. 334-335. The district court concurred in that
recommendation (53 F. Supp., p. 925), saying that the
trustee had investigated the charges, found no basis for
instituting legal proceedings on behalf of St. Louis Southwestern, and that there was no charge that the trustee had
acted in bad faith or had shown a lack of diligence. 53 F.
Supp. 926. Moreover, we were advised on oral argument,
although the matter does not appear of record, that a motion of Meyer in the St. Louis Southwestern proceedings
for an order directed to the trustee to show cause why
Meyer should not be permitted to prosecute the claim
filed by him in the Rock Island proceedings was denied in
February 1944. The grounds of this denial do not appear.
We can infer, on the basis of the opinion of the district
court confirming the plan, that the motion was denied
because the court was of the view that the claim had no
substance. But a decision of the court not to direct or
authorize its trustee to undertake the prosecution of a

327 U. S.

claim is one thing; the problem presented here is quite a
different one. While the court might not deem it provident to have the estate assume that burden, the continuation of the prosecution of the claim by Meyer might be
wholly compatible with the disposition of the claim by the
reorganization court or with the administration of the
estate. It is not apparent in this case that there would
be any such inconsistency in view of the fact that the plan
makes no provision for the claim. As stated in Johnson
v. Collier, supra, p. 540, "If the trustee will not sue and
the bankrupt cannot sue, it might result in the bankrupt's
debtor being discharged of an actual liability."
The order disallowing the claim will be reversed. On
remand of the cause the district court will allow the
claim to be amended by joining St. Louis Southwestern or
its trustee. If it is established that the continued prosecution of the claim will be inconsistent with the plan of
reorganization of St. Louis Southwestern or the administration of its affairs, the claim should be disallowed. If
it is not so established, the claim should then be considered on its merits.
So ordered.
