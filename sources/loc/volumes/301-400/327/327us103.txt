OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

327 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
The petitioner Hulbert bid $1,050 for a used farm-type
gasoline tractor which Twin Falls County, Idaho, offered
for sale at an auction. His was the highest bid. Upon
being informed by the Office of Price Administration that
the amount bid was above the ceiling price of $723.56,
petitioner refused to pay the full amount. He tendered
$723.56 which the County refused to accept. Thereupon
the County sued the petitioner in the state district court
for $1,050. Petitioner tendered $1,050 to be disposed of
according to the outcome of the case. He defended on
the ground that he had been advised by the Office of Price
Administration that the regulation setting a ceiling price
was applicable and stated that he was willing to pay any
sum up to $1,050 which was not prohibited by this regulation. The Administrator intervened, alleging that the bid
price exceeded the ceiling price fixed by Maximum Price
Regulation 133 'and that the regulation was applicable to
the sale of a tractor by the County. The County stated
that prior to the sale it had been advised by the County
Prosecuting Attorney that the sale would be controlled by
§ 30-708 of the Idaho Code, Ann., and that the Office of
Price Administration regulations were inapplicable. The
Idaho district court held the sale subject to the Emergency Price Control Act and to Regulation No. 133. The
court gave judgment for the County for the ceiling price
of $723.56, holding that the sale as to the amount above
that ceiling price was void. The Supreme Court of Idaho
reversed. 66 Idaho -,
156 P. 2d 319. We granted
certiorari because the supreme court's decision conflicted
with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in Bowles v. Case, 149 F. 2d 777.
The only question properly before us is whether Maximum Price Regulation No. 133 applies to sales of tractors

by a county. In defining the term "person" the regulation uses the same language as § 302 (h) of the Emergency Price Control Act. In Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92,
we held that that language makes the Act applicable to
sales by States and their subdivisions such as this one.
For the reasons set out in that opinion, this language as
employed in Regulation No. 133 makes that regulation
applicable to the sale of the tractor, by the County.
Reversed.

or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.

I think Judge Givens, writing for the Supreme Court
of Idaho (66 Idaho -, 156 P. 2d 319), has shown that it
is at least doubtful if Congress meant to include the States
as sellers under this Act.' I think there is little to add to
his analysis except to say that the doubt for me is increased
when the whole scheme of regulation is considered. While
§ 302 (h) would relieve the States from the criminal sanctions of the Act,' they would be subject to the treble
damage provisions of § 205 (e), which are remedial, not
punitive, in nature. Bowles v. American Stores, 139 F. 2d
377, 379. And the Administrator would have the power
under § 205 (f) (1) to require a State to get a license from
him in order to sell its commodities-a license which would
be subject to suspension. § 205 (f) (2). These are subSec. 302 (h) defines the term "person" as including "an individual,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other organized group
of persons, or legal successor or representative of any of the foregoing,
and includes the United States or any agency thereof, or any other
government, or any of its political subdivisions, or any agency of any
of the foregoing: Provided, That no punishment provided by this
Act shall apply to the United States, or to any such government,
political subdivision, or agency."

stantial intrusions on the sovereignty of the States, involving matters of great delicacy. And they raise for me
serious constitutional questions. Cf. New York v. United
States, 326 U. S. 572, 590, dissenting opinion. Since the
Act is at best ambiguous, I would choose the construction I
which avoided the constitutional issue. Only in the event
that the language of the Act was explicit would I assume
that Congress intended even in days of war to interfere
with the traditional sovereignty of the States to the extent
indicated.
UNITED STATES v. JOHNSON.
NO. 115.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued January 2, 1946.-Decided February 4, 1946.
1. Where, on an appeal from a denial of a motion for a new trial on
the ground of newly discovered evidence under Rule II (3) of the
Criminal Appeals Rules, it appears that the only objection is to the
trial court's findings on conflicting evidence and that there was
evidence to support its findings, the appeal does not present a reviewable issue of law; and the circuit court of appeals should, on

its own motion, dismiss the appeal as frivolous under Rule IV,
which gives the circuit courts of appeals power to supervise and
control all proceedings on appeal. P. 113.
2. It is important for the orderly administration of criminal justice
that findings on conflicting evidence by trial courts on motions for
new trial based on newly discovered evidence remain undisturbed,
except in most extraordinary circumstances. P. 111.
3. It is not the province of this Court or the circuit courts of appeals
to review orders granting or denying motions for a new trial when
such review is sought on the ground that the trial court made
erroneous findings of fact and it does not clearly appear that the
findings are not supported by any evidence. P. 111.
3A permissible construction is that the phrase "the United
States . . . or any other government" means the United States or

other comparable national sovereignties, i. e., foreign governments.
*Together with No. 116, United States v. Sommers et al., on
certiorari to the same court. Argued and decided on the same dates.
