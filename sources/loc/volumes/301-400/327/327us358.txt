327 U. S.

In order to have the benefit of the full strength of our
Constitution, both in time of peace and in time of war, it
is necessary to protect the authority of our legislative and

executive officials, as well as that of our courts, in the performance of their respective obligations to help to "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure

the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."
SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD v. NIEROTKO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 318.

Argued December 12, 1945.-Decided February 25, 1946.

1. "Back pay" awarded under the National Labor Relations Act
to an employee who was found to have been wrongfully discharged
is to be treated under the Social Security Act as "wages" for which
the employee is entitled to credit on his Old Age and Survivors
Insurance Account. Pp. 359, 364.
(a) The treatment of such back pay as wages under the Social
Security Act is required by that Act's definitions of wages as "remuneration for employment" and of employment as "any service,
of whatever nature, performed ... by any employee for his
employer." P. 364.
(b) The word "service," as used in the Act's definition of employment, means not only work actually performed but the entire
employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid
to the employee by the employer. Pp. 365-366.
(c) The construction of the Social Security Act by the Social
Security Board, whereby "back pay" is excluded from "wages," is
unsound and goes beyond the permissible limits of administrative
interpretation. P. 367.
(d) Administrative determinations must have a basis in law
and be within the authority granted the administrative agency.
P. 369.
(e) An administrative agency may not finally determine the
scope of its statutory power; that is a judicial function. P. 369.
*2. "Back pay" treated as "wages" under the Social Security Act
should be allocated to the periods for which the wages ordinarily
would have been paid. P. 370.

Opinion of the Court.

3. The back pay having been awarded for a period prior to the
1939 amendments of the Social Security Act although actually paid
thereafter, the decision here is controlled by the Act in its earlier
form. However, there is no suggestion of any significant difference
in the amended Act so far as the question here involved is concerned.

149 F. 2d 273, affirmed.

The Social Security Board refused to credit respondent's Old Age and Survivors Insurance Account with the
amount of "back pay" awarded him by the National Labor
Relations Board. The district court upheld the Social
Security Board. The circuit court of appeals reversed.

MR.JUSTICE

REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

A problem as to whether "back pay," which is granted
to an employee under the National Labor Relations Act,
shall be treated as "wages" under the Social Security Act
comes before us on this record. If such "back pay" is a
wage payment, there is also at issue the proper allocation
of such sums to the quarters of coverage for which the
"back pay" was allowed.
The respondent, Joseph Nierotko, was found by the
National Labor Relations Board to have been wrongfully
discharged for union activity by his employer, the Ford
Motor Company, and was reinstated by that Board in his
employment with directions for "back pay" for the period
February 2, 1937, to September 25, 1939.' The "back

pay" was paid by the employer on July 18, 1941. Thereafter Nierotko requested the Social Security Board to
credit him in the sum of the "back pay" on his Old Age
In
and Survivor's Insurance account with the Board
conformity with its minute of formal general action of
March 27, 1942, the Board refused to credit Nierotko's
"back pay" as wages. On review of the Board's decision,'
the district court upheld the Board. The circuit court of
appeals reversed. 149 F. 2d 273. On account of the importance of the issues in the administration of the Social
Security Act, we granted certiorari.4 326 U. S. 700; Judicial Code § 240.
During the period for which "back pay" was awarded
respondent the federal old age benefits were governed by
Title II of the Social Security Act of 1935. 49 Stat. 622.
As Title II of the Social Security Act Amendments of
1939 became effective January 1, 1940 (53 Stat. 1362),
the actual payment of the "back wages" occurred thereafter. In our view the governing provisions which determine whether this "back pay" is wages are those of
the earlier enactment.
Social Security Act, § 205 (c) (3), 53 Stat. 1369.
§ 205 (g).
4 The briefs of the Government advise us that more than thirty
thousand individual employees were allowed "back pay" in "closed"
cases by the National Labor Relations Board under § 10 (c), 49 Stat.
454, in the period 1939-1945. See Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board,
313 U. S. 177, 187, Second. The aggregate in money exceeded
$7,700,000 in the fiscal years 1939 to 1944, as shown by the reports of
the N. L. R. B. for those years.
5By the foregoing statement it is not intended to imply that the
variations in the definitions of wages between the two enactments are
significant on the issues herein considered. Sec. 209 (b) of the Amendment recognizes possible differences in the meaning of employment:

Opinion of the Court.

Wages are the basis for the administration of federal
old age benefits. 49 Stat. 622. Only those who earn wages
are eligible for benefits.' The periods of time during
which wages were earned are important and may be
crucial on eligibility under either the original act or the
Amendments of 1939. See § 210 (c) and compare § 209
as defined in section 210 (b) of the Social Security Act prior to January 1, 1940 (except service performed by an individual after he
attained the age of sixty-five if performed prior to January 1, 1939),
and any service, of whatever nature, performed after December 31,
1939, by an employee for the person employing him . . ."

210) shall be entitled to receive, with respect to the period beginning
on the date he attains the age of sixty-five, or on January 1, 1942,
whichever is the later, and ending on the date of his death, an old-age
benefit (payable as nearly as practicable in equal monthly installments) as follows:
(1) If the total wages (as defined in section 210) determined by
the Board to have been paid to him, with respect to employment (as
defined in section 210) after December 31, 1936, and before he attained the age of sixty-five, were not more than $3,000, the old-age
benefit shall be at a monthly rate of one-half of 1 per centum of
such total wages;
(2) If such total wages were more than $3,000, the old-age benefit
shall be at a monthly rate equal to the sum of the following:
(A) One-half of 1 per centum of $3,000; plus
(B) One-twelfth of 1 per centum of the amount by which such
total wages, exceeded $3,000 and did not exceed $45,000; plus
(C) One-twenty-fourth of 1 per centum of the amount by
which such total wages exceeded $45,000."

Opinion of the Court.

Employment is defined thus:
"(b) The term 'employment' means any service,
of whatever nature, performed within the United
States by an employee for his employer, except-"
The tax titles of the Social Security Act have identical
definitions of wages and employment.' An employee
under the Social Security Act is not specifically defined but
the individual to whom the Act's benefits are to be paid
is one receiving "wages" for "employment" in accordance
with § 210 (c) and employment is service by an "employee"
to an "employer." Obviously a sharply defined line between payments to employees which are wages and which
are not is essential to proper administration.'
Under the National Labor Relations Act an employee is
described as "any individual whose work has ceased . . .
because of any unfair labor practice." § 2 (3), 49 Stat.
450. The enforcement provisions of this Act under
which Nierotko received his "back pay" allow the Labor
Board to reinstate "employees with or without back pay."
§ 10 (c). The purpose of the "back pay" allowance
is to effectuate the policies of the Labor Act for the preservation of industrial peace."1

Act Amendments of 1939. See §§ 202 (a), 202 (e), 203 (d), 209 (a),

their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection."

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

327 U. S.

The purpose of the federal old age benefits of the Social
Security Act is to provide funds through contributions by
employer and employee for the decent support of elderly
workmen who have ceased to labor.12 Eligibility for these
benefits and their amount depends upon the total wages
which the employee has received and the periods in which
wages were paid. 8 While the legislative history of the
Social Security Act and its amendments or the language of
the enactments themselves does not specifically deal with
whether or not "back pay" under the Labor Act is to be
treated as wages under the Social Security Act, we think
it plain that an individual, who is an employee under
the Labor Act and who receives "back pay" for a period
of time during which he was wrongfully separated from
his job, is entitled to have that award of back pay treated
as wages under the Social Security Act definitions which
define wages as "remuneration for employment" and
employment as "any service . . . performed . . . by an
employee for his employer . . ."
Surely the "back pay" is "remuneration." Under § 10
(c) of the Labor Act, the Labor Board acts for the public
to vindicate the prohibitions of the Labor Act against
unfair labor practices (§ 8) and to protect the right of
employees to self-organization which is declared by § 7.1"
It i: also true that, in requiring reparation to the employee through "back pay," reparation is based upon the
loss of wages which the employee has suffered from the
employer's wrong. "Back pay" is not a fine or penalty
imposed upon the employer by the Board. Reinstate2

. a worker's loss in wages and in general

working conditions must be made whole." Phelps Dodge
Corp. v. Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177, 196. A worker is
not given "back pay" by the Board equal to what he
would have earned with the employer but for the unlawful
discharge, but is given that sum less any net earnings
during the time between discharge and reinstatement. 5
Since Nierotko remained an employee under the
definition of the Labor Act, although his employer had
attempted to terminate the relationship, he had "employment" under that Act and we need consider further only
whether under the Social Security Act its definition of
employment, as "any service . . . performed . . . by an

employee for his employer," covers what Nierotko did for
the Ford Motor Company. The petitioner urges that
Nierotko did not perform any service. It points out that
Congress in considering the Social Security Act thought
of benefits as related to "wages earned" for "work done." 1
We are unable, however, to follow the Social Security
Board in such a limited circumscription of the word
"service."

The very words "any service . . . performed

. . . for his employer," with the purpose of the Social Security Act in mind, import breadth of coverage. They
admonish us against holding that "service" can be only
productive activity. We think that "service" as used by
Congress in this definitive phrase means not only work

actually done but the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by
the employer.'
An argument against the interpretation which we give
to "service performed" is the contrary ruling of the governmental agencies which are charged with the administration of the Social Security Act. Their competence
1T

For example the Social Security Board's Regulations No. 3 in

considering "wages" treats vacation allowances as wages. 26 CFR,
1940 Supp., 402.227 (b).
Compare Armour & Co. v. Wantock, 323 U. S. 126, 133.
Treasury Department Regulations No. 91 relating to the Employees'
Tax and the Employer's Tax under Title VIII of the Social Security
Act, 1936, Art. 16, classifies dismissal pay, vacation allowances or sick
pay as wages. Regulations, 106 under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 1940, pp. 48,/'51, continues to consider vacation allowances as wages. It differentiates voluntary dismissal pay.
I. R. B., 1940, 1-22-10271, S. S. T. 389, an Office Decision, holds
that amounts paid employees during absence on jury service to make
their pay equivalent to regular salary are wages.
Though formal action was taken by the Social Security Board on
March 27, 1942, our attention has not been called to any regulation
of any governmental agency excluding "back pay" from wages. The
Treasury Department has authority to issue regulations for Social
Security taxes. §§ 808 and 908, 49 Stat. 638, et seq.; I. R. C., § 1429,
53 Stat. 178. So has the Social Security Board, § 1102, 49 Stat. 647,
and § 205 (a), 53 Stat. 1368. All authority for the promulgation of
regulations limits the action to rules and regulations not inconsistent
with the provisions of the various sections.
In regulations governing the collection of income taxes at source
on or after January 1, 1945, 58 Stat. 247, the Bureau of Internal Revenue classified vacation allowances and dismissal pay as wages under
the following statutory definition of wages:
"Sec. 1621. Definitions. As used in this subchapter(a) Wages.-The term 'wages' means all remuneration (other than
fees paid to a public official) for services performed by an employee
for his employer, including the cash value of all remuneration paid
in any medium other than cash; except that such term shall not include remuneration paid-" See 26 CFR, 1944 Supp., 405.101 (d)
and (e).

SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD v. NIEROTKO. 367
358

Opinion of the Court.

and experience in this field command us to reflect before
we decide contrary to their conclusion. The first administrative determination was apparently made in 1939 by
an Office Decision of the Bureau of Internal Revenue on
the problem of whether "back pay" under a Labor Board
order was wages subject to tax under Titles VIII and IX
of the Social Security Act which the Bureau collects. 8
The back pay was held not to be subject as wages to the
tax because no service was performed, the employer had
tried to terminate the employment relationship and the
allowance of back pay was discretionary with the Labor
Board. Reliance for the conclusions was placed upon
Agwilines, Inc. v. Labor Board, 87 F. 2d 146, which had
held "back pay" a public reparation order and therefore
not triable by jury as a private right for wages would have
been. This position is maintained by the Social Security
Board by minute of March 27, 1942. It is followed by the
National Labor Relations Board which at one time approved the retention by the employer of the tax on the
employees' back pay for transmission to the Treasury
Department as a tax on wages but later reversed its position on the authority of the Office Decision to which
reference has just been made. Re PennsylvaniaFurnace
& Iron Co., 13 N. L. R. B. 49, 53 (5), 54, 58.19
The Office Decision seems to us unsound. The portion
of the Agwilines decision, which the Office Decision relied
upon, was directed at the constitutional claim
to a right
of trial by jury. It stated that "back pay" was not a
penalty or damages which a private individual might
18 1. R. B., 1939, 1-14-9776, S. S. T. 359. No regulations covering
"back pay" under the Social Security Act have been found. They are
authorized by §§ 808 and 908, 49 Stat. 638, 643.
:1The States have largely followed the Bureau of Internal Revenue
in their classification of "back pay." Some have disagreed. Unemployment Insurance Service, All State Treatise, C. C. H., Paragraph
1201. See Matter of Tonra, 258 App. Div. 835, 15 N. Y. S. 2d 755;

claim. But there is nothing in the opinion which supports the idea that the "back pay" award differs from
other pay. Indeed the opinion said that "Congress has
the right to eradicate them [unfair practices] as from
the beginning." 87 F. 2d at 151, 1. c. We think the true
relation of awards of "back pay" to compensation appears
in the Republic Steel and Phelps-Dodge cases, hereinbefore discussed.2 °
But it is urged by petitioner that the administrative
construction on the question of whether "back pay" is
to be treated as wages should lead us to follow the
agencies' determination. There is a suggestion that the
administrative decision should be treated as conclusive,
and reliance for that argument is placed upon Labor
Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. 111, 130, and
Gray v. Powell, 314 U. S. 402, 411. In the acts which
were construed in the cases just cited, as in the Social
Security Act, the administrators of those acts were given
power to reach preliminary conclusions as to coverage in
the application of the respective acts. Each act contains
a standardized phrase that Board findings supported by
substantial evidence shall be conclusive.2' The validity
of regulations is specifically reserved for judicial determination by the Social Security Act Amendments of 1939,
§ 205 (g).
The Social Security Board and the Treasury were compelled to decide, administratively, whether or not to treat
"back pay" as wages; and their expert judgment is entitled, as we have said, to great weight.2 The very fact

was presented in bankruptcy. Labor Board v. Killoren, 122 F. 2d

that judicial review has been accorded, however, makes
evident that such decisions are only conclusive as to
properly supported findings of fact. Both Hearst Publications, p. 131, and Gray v. Powell, p. 411, advert to the
limitations of administrative interpretations. Administrative determinations must have a basis in law and
must be within the granted authority. Administration,
when it interprets a statute so as to make it apply to
particular circumstances, acts as a delegate to the legislative power. Congress might have declared that "back
pay" awards under the Labor Act should or should not
be treated as wages. Congress might have delegated to
the Social Security Board to determine what compensation paid by employers to employees should be treated
as wages. Except as such interpretive power may be
included in the agencies' administrative functions, Congress did neither. An agency may not finally decide the
limits of its statutory power. That is a judicial function." Congress used a well understood word-"wages"to indicate the receipts which were to govern taxes and
benefits under the Social Security Act. There may be
borderline payments to employees on which courts would
follow administrative determination as to whether such
payments were or were not wages under the act.
We conclude, however, that the Board's interpretation
of this statute to exclude back pay goes beyond the
boundaries of administrative routine and the statutory
limits. This is a ruling which excludes from the ambit

of the Social Security Act payments which we think were
included by Congress. It is beyond the permissible limits
of administrative interpretation.
Petitioner further questions the validity of the decision
of the circuit court of appeals on the ground that it must
be inferred from the opinion that the "back pay" must
be allocated as wages by the Board to the "calendar
quarters" of the year in which the money would have been
earned, if the employee had not been wrongfully discharged. We think this inference is correct.2 4 This conclusion, petitioner argues, tends to show that "back pay"
cannot be wages because the Amendments of 1939 use
."quarters" as the basis for eligibility as well as the measure
of benefits and require "wages" to be "paid" in certain
"quarters." '
If, as we have held above, "back pay" is to be treated
as wages, we have no doubt that it should be allocated
to the periods when the regular wages were not paid as
usual. Admittedly there are accounting difficulties which
the Board will be called upon to solve but we do not
believe they are insuperable. 6

323 U. S.126. This is, practically speaking, the ordinary
situation of employment in a "stand-by" capacity.
United States v. Local 807, 315 U. S. 521, 535. The
basis of a back-pay order under the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. § 151, is precisely
that. When the employer is liable for back pay, he is so
liable because under the circumstances, though he has
illegally discharged the employee, he still absorbs his
time. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, 313 U. S. 177.
In short, an employer must pay wages although, in violation of law, he has subjected his employee to enforced
idleness. Since such compensation is in fact paid as
wages, it is a plain disregard of the law for the Social
Security Board not to include such payments among
the employees' wages. Neither the terms of the Social
Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 53 Stat. 1360, 42 U. S. C.
§ 301, nor the implications of policy, comparable to some
aspects of the Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, 48 Stat.

to exclude from wages what as a matter of law are wages.

base for benefits would represent the worker's actual remuneration
from employment. These include tips, dismissal payments which the
employer is not legally required to make but nevertheless does make,
and payments made under orders of the National Labor Relations
Board or a similar State board."
A pending bill, S.1050, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., Part F, § 275, makes
provision for the inclusion in wages under the Social Security Act of
sums paid pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act.
"Back pay" is now treated distributively under the Internal Revenue Code. § 119, Revenue Act of 1943, 58 Stat. 39.
