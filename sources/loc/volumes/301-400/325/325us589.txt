ET AL.

BILL IN EQUITY.

Argued March 5, 6, 7, 1945.-Decided June 11, 1945.
1. In a proceeding within the original jurisdiction of this Court,
brought by Nebraska against Wyoming, in which Colorado was
impleaded as a defendant and the United States was granted leave
to intervene, this Court makes an equitable apportionment between
the States of the water of the North Platte River. Pp. 591, 610.
2. Colorado and Wyoming having the rule of priority of appropriation,
and that rule being dominant in the Nebraska areas affected, the
case is treated as involving appropriation rights in the three States.
P. 599.
3. Since the dependable natural flow of the river during the irrigation
season has long been over-appropriated, since the claims of the States
to the water of the river are based not only on present uses but on
projected additional uses as well, and since the claims to the water
exceed the supply, there exists a conflict of interests of that character
and dignity which makes the controversy a justiciable one within
the original jurisdiction of this Court. Wyoming v. Colorado, 259
U. S. 419, followed. P. 610.
4. The water rights on which the North Platte Project and the Kendrick'Project rest having been obtained in compliance with state
law, it is unnecessary to determine what rights to unappropriated
water of the river the United States may have. Nor is it important
to the decree to be entered in this case that there may be unappropriated water to which the United States may in the future assert
rights through the machinery of state law or otherwise. P. 611.
Assuming arguendo that the United States did own all of the
unappropriated water, the apprupriations under state law were
made to the individual landowners pursuant to the procedure which
Congress provided in the Reclamation Act, and the rights so acquired are as definite and complete as if they were obtained by direct
cession from the federal government. P. 615.
5. Allocation of the water rights here in question to the States, who
represent their citizens parens patriae in this proceeding, in no wise
interferes with the ownership and operation by the United States
of its storage and power plants, works, and facilities. P. 616.
6. The difficulties of drafting and enforcing'a decree apportioning the
water of the river among the claimant States-where efforts at
settlement have failed; a genuine controversy exists; and the grav-

ity and importance of the case are apparent--do not justify refusal
by this Court to perform the important function entrusted to it by
the Constitution. P. 616.
7. Equitable apportionment among appropriation States does not
require a literal application of the priority rule. P. 618.
Although priority of appropriation is the guiding principle, other
relevant factors include: physical and climatic conditions; the
consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river; the
character and rate of return flows; the extent of established uses;
the availability of storage water; the practical effect of wasteful
uses on downstream areas; the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is imposed
on the former.
8. The decree of equitable apportionment to be entered in this case
must deal with conditions as they exist at present and must be
based on the dependable flow of the river which is not greater than
the average condition which has prevailed since 1930. P. 620.
9. The decree of equitable apportionment which is entered apportions
the natural flow of the river among the three States to the Tri-State
Dam in Nebraska but not below it. Pp. 621, 654.
10. The United States is not given a separate allocation of water,
since the water rights appropriated by the Secretary of the Interior
were adjudicated to be in the individual landowners and since the
United States as an appropriator of storage water is represented by
the State of Wyoming. P. 629.
11. Storage water is not included in the apportionment, although it
is taken into account in determining each State's equitable share of
the natural flow. P. 639.
12. 'The Court retains jurisdiction of the suit for the purpose of any
order, direction, or modification of the decree, or any supplementary
decree, that may at any time be deemed proper in relation to the
subject matter of the controversy. P. 655.

purposes were violating the rule of priority of appropriation in force in the three States and depriving Nebraska of
water to which she was equitably entitled. The prayer
was for a determination of the equitable share of each
State in the water and of the priorities of all appropriations
in both States, and for an injunction restraining the alleged
wrongful diversions. Wyoming denied the diversion or
use of any water to which Nebraska was equitably entitled
but joined in the prayer of Nebraska for an equitable apportionment. Colorado filed an answer, together with a
cross-bill against Nebraska and Wyoming, which denied
any use or threatened use of the water of the North Platte
beyond her equitable share, and prayed for an equitable
apportionment between the three States, excepting only
the tributary waters of the South Platte and Laramie
rivers.1 At the conclusion of Nebraska's case and again
after all the evidence was in, Colorado moved to dismiss the
suit on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to
sustain any judgment in favor of, or against, any party.
Colorado argues here that there should be no affirmative
relief against her and that she should be dismissed from
the case.

the mountainous region known as North Park.2 It pro' The waters of the South Platte and the Laramie were previously
apportioned-the former between Colorado and Nebraska by com,pact (44 Stat. 195), the latter between Colorado and Wyoming by

are in no way affected by the decree in this case.

ceeds in a northerly direction on the east side of the Continental Divide, enters Wyoming west of Cheyenne, and
continues in a northerly direction to the vicinity of Casper.
There it turns east across the Great Plains and proceeds
easterly and southerly into and across Nebraska. About
40 miles west of the Nebraska line it is joined by the Laramie River. At North Platte, Nebraska, it is joined by
the South Platte, forming the Platte River. It empties
into the Missouri River at Plattsmouth, near the western
border of Iowa. In North Park it is a rapid mountain
stream. In eastern Wyoming it gradually broadens out,
losing velocity. In western and central Nebraska its channel ranges from 3,000 to 6,000 feet; it frequently divides
into small channels; and in times of low water is lost in
the deep sands of its bed. Here it is sometimes characterized as a river "two miles wide and one inch deep."
There are six natural sections of the river basin: (1)
North Park, Colorado, or more accurately Jackson
County; (2) Colorado-Wyoming line to the Pathfinder
Reservoir located between Rawlins and Casper, Wyoming; (3) Pathfinder Reservoir to Whalen, Wyoming,
which is 42 miles from the Nebraska line; (4) Whalen,
Wyoming to the Tri-State Dan in Nebraska near the
Wyoming-Nebraska line; (5) Tri-State Dam to the
Kingsley Reservoir, west of Keystone, Nebraska; (6)
Kingsley Reservoir to Grand Island, Nebraska.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

The river basin in Colorado and Wyoming is arid, irrigation being generally indispensable to agriculture. Western Nebraska is partly arid and partly semi-arid. Irrigation is indispensable to the kind of agriculture established
there. Middle Nebraska is sub-humid. Some crops can
be raised without irrigation. But the lack of irrigation
would seriously limit diversification. Eastern Nebraska,
beginning at Grand Island, is sufficiently humid so as not
to justify irrigation.
Irrigation in the river basin began about 1865, when
some projects were started in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. Between 1880 and 1890 irrigation began on
a large scale. Until 1909 storage of water was negligible,
irrigation being effected by direct diversions and use.
Prior to 1909 the development in Colorado and Wyoming was relatively more rapid than in Nebraska. Since
1910 the acreage under irrigation in Colorado increased
about 14 per cent, that of Wyoming 31 per cent, and that
of Nebraska about 100 per cent.' The large increase in
Nebraska is mainly attributable to the use of 'storage
water from the Pathfinder Reservoir.'
The Pathfinder Reservoir is part of the "North Platte
Project" which followed the adoption by Congress in 1902
of the Reclamation Act. 32 Stat. 388. Pathfinder was
completed in 1913. It has a capacity of 1,045,000 acre

feet, which is 79 per cent of the average annual run-off of
the North Platte River at that point. This project includes an auxiliary channel reservoir called Guernsey, located above Whalen, Wyoming. Its capacity is 50,870
acre feet. The project also includes two small reservoirs
in Nebraska-Lake Alice and Lake Minatare-having a
capacity of 11,400 and 67,000 acre feet respectively.
There are two main supply canals-Interstate and Fort
Laramie-which take out from the North Platte at the
Whalen diversion dam. The Interstate canal runs on the
north side and the Fort Laramie on the south side of the
river. Both extend far into Nebraska. Northport-a
third canal-is located wholly in Nebraska. These canals
and their laterals extend over 1,600 miles. The project
also includes a drainage system and two hydroelectric
power plants. The United States contracted with landowners or irrigation districts for use of the water-selling
it, as contemplated by the Reclamation Act, so as to recoup the cost of the project which was about $19,000,000.
It also entered into so-called Warren Act contracts pursuant to the Act known by that name (36 Stat. 925)
which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to contract
for the storage and delivery of any surplus water conserved
by any reclamation project in excess of the requirements
of the project.
We have mentioned the Interstate, Ft. Laramie, and
Northport canals which are part of the North Platte Project, the first two of which take out at the Whalen diversion
dam. About a mile east of the Wyoming-Nebraska line
is the Tri-State Dam. Just above that dam in Nebraska
are the headgates of three large Nebraska canals-TriState, Gering, and Northport. Water for the Northport
is diverted through the Tri-State headgate, Northport
physically being an extension of the Tri-State canal. Another Nebraska canal is the Ramshorn which also receives
its supply through Tri-State. Just above the state line is
the headg.7te of the Mitchell canal serving Nebraska land.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

While these five canals are commonly referred to as the
Nebraska State Line Canals, this opinion generally uses
the term as excluding Northport which, as we have said,
is a North Platte Project canal. There are also nine
Wyoming private canals diverting below Whalen. One of
these, French Canal, serves lands in both Wyoming and
Nebraska. The section of the river from Whalen to the
Tri-State Dam is the pivotal section of the entire river.
In this short stretch of 40-odd miles is concentrated a
demand for water as great as in the entire preceding 415
miles apart from the Kendrick project to which we will
refer. We will return to a consideration of the problems
of this pivotal section shortly.
The North Platte Project has greatly increased the water
resources of the river available for irrigation. Unused and
wasted water are stored and held over&from one season
to another. Moreover, the storage water has affected the
water tables through saturation of the subsoil. This has
increased the return flows available for rediversion and
irrigation. The Special Master found that due largely to
the influence of the North Platte Project and the application of storage water to lands in eastern Wyoming and
western Nebraska the return flows increased from a negligible quantity in 1911 to 700,000 acre feet in 1927. While
that amount sharply declined during the drought beginning in 1931, it still is substantial. Thus from 1931-1936
it amounted to 54,300 acre feet in the Whalen-Tri-State
Dam section. And as we have already said, the great and
disproportionate increase in acreage irrigated in Nebraska
since 1910 as compared with the increase in Colorado and
Wyoming is largely attributable to the North Platte Project. While the North Platte Project has increased the
water resources, it has complicated the problem of .water
administration in Wyoming and Nebraska. It has necessitated a segregation of storage and natural flow. The
storage plants and diversion works are in Wyoming, although much of the beneficial use is in Nebraska. Appro-

priators in Nebraska are dependent on regulation and
control in Wyoming.
There is a second large federal irrigation project in
Wyoming known as the Kendrick project, the estimated
cost of which is over $19,000,000. Its primary purpose is
the irrigation of some 66,000 acres north and west of Casper, Wyoming. The first unit, capable of serving 35,000
acres, was completed in 1940. Due to the lack~of water
supply it has not yet been put into operation. The second
unit is under construction. The storage facilitie4 are completed, They consist of two channel reservoirs--the
Seminoe, thirty miles above Pathfinder, with a capacity
of 1,026,400 acre feet; the Alcova, thirteen miles below
Pathfinder, with a capacity of 190,500 acre feet. Casper
Canal will divert the water at Alcova and serve the lands
of the project.
The combined storage capacity of the reservoirs of these
two federal projects-Kendrick and North Platte-is
2,313,270 acre feet which, as the Special Master found, is
175 per cent of the long-time average annual run-off of
the river at Pathfinder.
There are also two projects in Nebraska-Sutherland,
with a capacity of 175,000 acre feet, and Tri-County, with
a capacity of 2,000,000 acre feet. The latter is expected
to bring under irrigation an additional 205,000 acres in
Nebraska. Including that acreage but excluding the
60,000 acres expected to be irrigated in Wyoming under
the Kendrick project, the Special Master found that the
acreages under irrigation in the three States would be
approximately as follows:
Colorado ..........................
Wyoming .........................

irrigation in western Nebraska and to some extent in
eastern Wyoming. Many irrigation enterprises were
closed. After the North Platte Project had been in operation for awhile most of the projects which had been
abandoned were reopened. From then until 1931 the
supply was reasonably adequate for most of the canals.
But the year 1931 started the driest cycle or swing in the
North Platte and Platte River valleys of which there is
any record. The annual flow at Pathfinder 6 had always
fluctuated widely.' The average flow for the 37 years
commencing in 1904 was 1,315,900 acre feet, the maximum was 2,399,400 in 1917, the minimum was 382,200
in 1934. But a critical condition arose in 1931 with the
advent of the dry cycle. The flow for each of the years
between 1931 and 1940 as compared with the mean of
the flow for the 37-year period ending in 1940 was as
follows:

8 Which the Special Master found to be the best single index on the
river due to the fact that the main accretions of Colorado and Wyoming
are already in the river and the natural flow is not appreciably distorted by storage releases as it is below Pathfinder.

Opinion of the Court.

Since 1930 only one year equalled the mean of the 1904
to 1930 period. Previous droughts had not exceeded two
or three years. The present cycle has persisted for 13
years.
The commencement of this dry cycle plus the initiation
of the Kendrick project precipitated the present controversy. Nebraska rests her case essentially on evidence of
shortage and of misappropriation of water by the upper
States since 1930 and 6f threats of more serious shortage
and diversions in the future.
II
The equitable apportionment which Nebraska seeks is
based on the principle of priority of appropriation applied
interstate. Colorado and Wyoming have the rule of
priority of appropriation as distinguished from the rule
of riparian rights. Colo. Constitution, Art. XVI, ยง ยง 5, 6;,
Farmers' High Line Canal Co. v. Southworth, 13 Colo.

problem in Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 459.
Nebraska on the other hand was originally a riparian doctrine State. See Meng v. Coffee, 67 Neb. 500, 93 N. W.
713. But when the more arid sections of the State were
settled and the need for irrigation increased, legislation
was enacted adopting the appropriation principle. See
Neb. L. 1889, ch. 68; L. 1895, ch. 69. That principle was
recognized in the constitution which Nebraska adopted
in 1920. See Article XV, ยง ยง 4, 5, and 6. The adoption of
the rule of appropriation did not extinguish riparian rights
which had previously vested. See Clark v. Cambridge &
Arapahoe Co., 45 Neb. 798, 64 N. W. 239; Crawford Co.
v. Hathaway, 60 Neb. 754, 84 N. W. 271, 61 Neb. 317, 85

Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Nebraska District, 131 Neb. 356, 268 N. W. 334. But
riparian rights may be condemned in favor of appropriators; and violation of riparian rights by appropriators
will not be enjoined, only compensation or damages being
awarded. Cline v. Stock, 71 Neb. 79, 102 N. W. 265;
McCook IrrigationCo. V. Crews, 70 Neb. 115, 102 N. W.
249. In that sense riparian rights are considered inferior
to rights of appropriators. More important, the rights
asserted by Nebraska in this suit are based wholly on appropriations which have been obtained and recognized
under Nebraska law. The appropriation system is dominant in the regions of Nebraska which are involved in
the present litigation. Hence we, like the Special Master,
treat the case as one involving appropriation rights not
only in Colorado and Wyoming but in Nebraska as well.
North Park. There are at present in the North Park
area in Colorado (Jackson County) 131,800 acres irrigated. The climate is arid. The sole industry is cattle
raising, the only crops being native hay and pasturage.
The growing season is short. While the' diversions are
high per acre (about 4 acre-feet) the return flows are
large, making the average consumptive use 8 rate only .74
acre foot per acre. The 131,800 acres of irrigated land
consume 98,572 acre feet annually, including reservoir
evaporation. Exportations from the basin are expected
to average 6,000 acre feet, making the total annual depletion 104,540 acre feet. Though Colorado claimed that
an additional 100,003 acres in North Park was susceptible
of irrigation, the Special Master found that there are only
about 34,000 acres of additional land that could be brought
under irrigation; 30,390 of those acres are irrigable from
constructed ditch systems having water rights. Those
projects, however, are not completed; they are indeed
projects for the indefinite future. In addition to these

and water which returns to the stream after use for irrigation.

Opinion of the Court.

projects in North Park, Colorado also has proposed that
large quantities of water from the river be exported from
the basin into other rivers.
There have been out-of-priority diversions in Colorado
and Wyoming above Pathfinder in relation to the priorities and needs of Nebraska users. Their full extent is not
known. But as respects Pathfinder, the Special Master
estimated that Colorado appropriators junior to Pathfinder consume about 30,000 acre feet a year. Since Pathfinder after 1930 has never been filled and has always been
in need of water for storage, those Colorado junior diversions may be said to have violated the Pathfinder priority.
The claims of Colorado to additional demands were construed by the Special Master as a threat of further depletion of the river within North Park. He found that there
was no surplus in the supply and that any material increase in diversions in Colorado would be in violation of
established priorities, notably Pathfinder.
Colorado Linedo -PathfinderReservoir. In the region
between the Colorado-Wyoming line and Pathfinder appropriation rights cover about 272,000 acres, 149,400 of
which are irrigated. But of those only 9,400 acres are
irrigated from the main stream, the balance being irrigated from tributaries. The consumptive use rate is about
1 acre foot per acre. Over.two-thirds of the volume of
diversions (main stream and tributaries) and 88 per cent
from the main stream are senior to the North Platte
Project. They are in the main junior to the State Line
Canals in Nebraska. Those projects junior to Pathfinder
have been operated since 1930 in violation of its priority.
The Special Master found that there is no present prospect of any large expansion of irrigation in this area,
though five additional projects have been contemplated,
some of them being partially constructed. The accretions
to the river from tributaries in this section are very largeabout 790,240 acre feet net. Land consumption is 16 per

Under Wyoming law reservoirs in storing water must observe the priority of all senior Wyoming canals below them
on the main river.
Kendrick Project. Seminoe Reservoir has a priority of
December 1, 1931; Casper Canal, July 27, 1934 (natural
flow); Alcova Reservoir, April 25, 1936. Apart from
minor exceptions Seminoe is junior to every appropriator
from Alcova to the Tri-State Dam. The project is expected to operate chiefly on storage water. In its early
stages its water requirements will be heavier than they
will be later, due to ground absorption and storage.
When the project has been in operation a while, the depletion during the irrigation season will be about 122,000
acre feet, except as water stored in non-irrigation season
is used. The Special Master found, however, that without
violating the Pathfinder priority, the Kendrick project
could have stored no water since 1930 and can store none
in the future if present conditions continue. He also

Opinion of the Court.

found that under the average conditions which prevailed
from 1895 to 1939 water could be conserved by Seminoe
and Alcova without violation of the priorities between
Pathfinder and Tri-State Dam and in sufficient quantities
to supply Kendrick and to leave considerable return flow
to the river in the irrigation season. There are in the
first unit of the project two sump areas into which return
water will flow and from which the United States has constructed drainage ditches so as to return the water to the
river. On the uncompleted unit three sump areas are
planned. These are designed to return to the river water
which otherwise would be lost.
Pathfinderto Whalen. The total land irrigated in this
section is in excess of 55,000 acres, of which about 14,000
acres are supplied from the main river. Alfalfa, sugar
beets, potatoes, and grains are the principal irrigated
crops. There are 60 canals taking out of the main river
with priorities ranging from 1887 to 1937. In terms of
acreage about 48 per cent of the rights on the river in this
section are junior to the North Platte Project. All except one are junior to the Tri-State canal and most of
them are junior to the other Nebraska State Line Canals.
The irrigation projects on the river average not over 160
acres. The consumptive use rate is about 1.1 acre feet per
acre. The diversion rate of 2.5 acre feet per acre is deemed
adequate. But during the 1931-1940 period the average
seasonal diversion rate for the section was only 2 acre
feet, since in low stages of flow some of the ditches are
unable to divert any water. But at the rate of 2.5 acre
feet the total seasonal headgate diversion for the 14;000
acres is 35,000 acre feet of which 18,200 acre feet would be
returned to the river. Of that return all but 15 per cent
(2,730 acre feet) would occur during the irrigation season. The tributary inflow is greater than river depletion
due to irrigations and other losses. The average annual
net gain from 1931-1940 was 64,200 acre feet. During

the 1931-1940 period, the maximum seasonal average consumption out-of-priority in relation to the Nebraska State
Line Canals was found by the Special Master to be 5,400
acre feet. With probable minor exceptions there are no
further possibilities for irrigation developments in this
section.
Whalen to Tri-State Dam. As we have said, this is the
pivotal section of the river around which the central
problems of this case turn. Apart from the Kendrick
project, the demand for water is as great in this short section of the river as in the entire preceding 415 miles from
North Park to Whalen. The lands irrigated from the river
in this section total 326,000 acres as compared with339,200 acres in the upper valley-main river and tributaries. The consumptive use on this 326,000 acres far
exceeds that of the upper sections combined. We have
mentioned the various canals which take out from the river
in this section. The Special Master found their annual
requirements to be 1,072,514 acre feet. The total net
seasonal requirement of all the canals diverting in this
section was found to be 1,027,000 acre feet. In the tenyear period from 1931 to 1940 this net seasonal requirement of 1,027,000 acre feet largely exceeded the supply in
three years and was less than the supply in seven years. 9
In those seven years the seasonal flows passing the TriState Dam were far less than the excesses, indicating as the
Special Master concluded that canal diversions in the
section were greater than the requirements. He pointed
out that if the diversions during the period had been re9 The excess or deficiency for each of those years is indicated by the

stricted to the determined requirements and if the excess
had been held in storage in the upper reservoirs and released indiscriminately to all canals as needed, irrespective
of storage rights, any surplus water would have been conserved and would not have passed Tri-State. He estimated that under that method of operation the total
supply (excluding any supply for Kendrick) would have
been approximately sufficient for the section.
But on the basis of the 1931-1940 supply the seasonal
requirement of 1,027,000 acre feet cannot be met by
natural flow alone and without storage water. The
Special Master roughly estimated the deficiency of natural
flow as follows for the period of 1931 to 1940:

"Natural flow," as used by the Special Master and as used in this
opinion, means all water in the stream except that which comes from
storage water releases.

On that basis the average seasonal supply of natural
flow available in this section was only 48 per cent of the
total requirement. In 1933, the year of largest flow, it
was only 75 per cent. In general the practice has been to
allow storage right canals having early priorities to receive
natural flow water on a priority basis, using storage water
merely as a supplementary supply. In this area 90 per
cent of the lands have both natural flow and storage
rights."0 Seventy-eight per cent of the lands having stor10 Of this 90 per cent, 68 per cent are project lands and 32 per cent
have Warren Act contracts.

age rights are in Nebraska, 22 per cent in Wyoming. Of
the lands having natural flow rights only 49 per cent are in
Nebraska and 51 per cent in Wyoming.
As respects priority, the canals.(listed later in this
opinion) fall into thirteen groups, seven in Wyoming and
six in Nebraska. The earliest in priority are some canals
in Wyoming, then some in Nebraska, then others in Wyoming and so on.
The exceptional features of this section of the river were
summarized by the Special Master as follows:
"(1) the great concentration of demand in a short compact section, (2) the presence of water, both natural flow
and storage, to which Nebraska users are entitled under
Wyoming appropriations, (3) the total dependence of
Nebraska State Line Canals and the North Platte project
canals upon water originating in Wyoming and Colorado,
(4) the joint use of canals to serve both Wyoming and
Nebraska lands, (5) the location in Wyoming of the head
gates and works which divert great volumes of water for
Nebraska, (6) the distinctly interstate scope and character of the water distribution without any real interstate
administration."
The Special Master made a detailed study of the requirements of each canal in this section and the diversions of each during the 1931-1940 period. We need not
recapitulate it. The nine Wyoming canals and the TriState canal fared well. A comparison of the average seasonal diversions with the seasonal requirements shows that
they had an excess supply for the ten-year period-122
per cent and 111 per cent respectively-the former having
a deficiency in only one of the ten years, the latter a deficiency in three. For the rest of these canals it appears that
the average seasonal diversions supplied from 78 per cent
to 98 per cent of their seasonal requirements. The Ft.
Laramie was short in eight of the ten years, Gering, Ramshorn and Northport in seven each.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

Tri-State Dam to Bridgeport, Neb. Nebraska originally claimed that any equitable distribution which was
made should extend to all irrigated lands as far east as
Grand Island, Neb. It is now conceded that the lands east
of Bridgeport, Neb., which is some sixty miles from the
Wyoming-Nebraska state line, can be reasonably satisfied
out of local supplies. Hence we are not concerned in this
case with that section.
In the section west of Bridgeport, there are twelve canals exclusive of the Ramshorn relevant to the present
problem. Their requirements are 132,420 acre feet; their
demand on the main river is 102,810 acre feet, the balance
being obtained from interceptions of drains, return flows,
and tributary streams. The Special Master concluded
that local supplies even during the drought period were
adequate to take care of the needs of these canals without
calling upon up-river water. Some shortages occurred,
caused for example by excessive use by some canals at the
expense of others or by the withdrawal of water from the
section to supply senior canals below. It would seem that
the construction and operation of the Kingsley and Sutherland Reservoirs would largely eliminate the latter condition. And water passing Tri-State Dam and usable in
the Tri-State to Bridgeport section is substantial-the
mean divertible flow for the irrigation season in the 19311940 period being 81,700 acre feet. Over half, of this
occurred in May and June; very little in August and
September.

Motion to Dismiss. As we have noted, Colorado moves
to dismiss the proceeding. She asserts that the pleadings
and evidence both indicate that she has not injured nor
presently threatens to injure any downstream water user.
She emphasizes the large increase since 1910 in acreage
under irrigation in Wyoming and Nebraska as compared

OCTOBER TEAM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

with the increase in Colorado. She asserts there is a surplus of water in the stream, as evidenced by the fact that
during the recent drought or dry cycle the Kendrick Project in Wyoming and the Tri-County Project in Nebraska
have been constructed, indicating that the sponsors considered that the available water supply was not entirely
used by existing projects. And she emphasizes that during the drought there was a divertible flow passing TriState Dam during the irrigation season. The argument
is that the case is not of such serious magnitude and the
damage is not so fully and clearly proved as to warrant
the intervention of this Court under our established practice. Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 521; Colorado v.
Kansas, 320 U. S. 383, 393-394. The argument is that the
potential threat of injury, representing as it does only a
possibility for the indefinite future, is no basis for a decree
in an interstate suit since we cannot issue declaratory decrees. Arizona v. California,283 U. S. 423, 462-464, and
cases cited.
We fully recognize those principles. But they do not
stand in the way of, an entry of a decree in this case.
The evidence supports the finding of the Special Master
that the dependable natural flow of the river during the
irrigatfon season has long been over-appropriated. A genuine controversy exists. The States have not been able
to settle their differences by compact. The areas involved
are arid or semi-arid. Water in dependable amounts is
essential to the maintenance of the vast agricultural enterprises established on the various sections of the river.
The dry cycle which has continued over a decade has precipitated a clash of interests which between sovereign
powers could be traditionally settled only by diplomacy
or war. The original jurisdiction of this Court is one of
the alternative methods pr6vided by the Framers of our
Constitution. Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U. S. 208, 241;
Georgiav. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237. The

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

Kendrick Project plainly is an existing threat to senior
appropriators downstream. As we have noted, it is junior
to practically every appropriation on the river between
Alcova and the Tri-State Dam. Since 1930 there would
have been no water for it if it were operated on a priority
basis. And in view of the general position taken by Wyoming with respect to Nebraska priorities, it cannot be assumed that the Kendrick Project would be regulated for
the benefit of senior appropriators in Nebraska. Neither
Wyoming nor Colorado has ever recognized any extension
of priorities across state lines. They have never limited
or regulated diversions by their appropriators in subordination to the senior appropriators of a downstream State.
Out-of-priority diversions by Colorado have had an adverse effect downstream. We do not know their full extent; but we do know that Colorado appropriators junior
to Pathfinder consume about 30,000 acre feet a year and
that Pathfinder has never been filled since 1930 and has
always been in need of water. This alone negatives the
absence of present injury. The fact that on the average
there is some water passing Tri-State Dam unused is no
answer. While over half of that excess amount occurred
in May and June, there was comparatively little in August and September. Moreover, we are dealing here with
the problems of natural flow. The critical condition of the
supply of the natural flow during 1931-1940 in the Whalen
to Tri-State Dam section is obvious. The claim of Colorado to additional demands may not be disregarded.
The fact that Colorado's proposed projectsare not planned
for the immediate future is not conclusive in view of the
present over-appropriation of natural flow. The additional demands on the river which those projects involve
constitute a threat of further depletion. Colorado in her
argument here asserts, that "if Jackson County is to maintain its livestock industry to the same extent as it has in
the past it will have to develop this additional summer

610

325 U. S.

pasture and it cannot do this without increasing its irrigated acreage."
What we have then is a situation where three States
assert against a river, whose dependable natural flow during the irrigation season has long been over-appropriated,
claims based not only on present uses but on projected
additional uses as well. The various statistics with which
the record abounds are inconclusive in showing the existence or extent of actual damage to Nebraska. But we
know that deprivation of water in arid or semi-arid regions
cannot help but be injurious. That was the basis for the
apportionment of water made by the Court in Wyoming
v. Colorado, supra. There the only showing of injury or
threat of injury was the inadequacy of the supply of water
to meet all appropriative rights. As much if not more
is shown here. If this were an equity suit to enjoin threatened injury, the showing made by Nebraska might possibly be insufficient. But Wyoming v. GColorado, supra,
indicates that where the claims to the water of a river
exceed the supply a controversy exists appropriate for
judicial determination. If there were a surplus of unappropriated water, different considerations would be applicable. Cf. Arizona v. California, 298 U. S. 558. But
where there is not enough water in the river to satisfy
the claims asserted against it, the situation is not basically
different from that where two or more persons claim the
right to the same parcel of land. The present claimants
being States, we think the clash of interests to be of that
character and dignity which makes the controversy a
justiciable one under our original jurisdiction.
Colorado v. Kansas, supra, is not opposed to this view.
That case turned on its special facts. It is true that an
apportionment of the water of an interstate river was
denied in that case. But the downstream State (Kansas)
did not sustain the burden of show ng that since the earlier
litigation between the States (ee Kansas v. Colorado,

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

206 U. S. 46), there had been a material increase in the
depletion of the river by Colorado. Improvements based
upon irrigation had been made by Colorado while Kansas
stood by for over twenty years without protest. We held
that in those circumstances a plain showing was necessary
of increased depletion and substantial injury to warrant
a decree which would disrupt the economy of the upstream State built around irrigation. Moreover, we made
clear (320 U. S. p. 392, note 2) that we were not dealing
there with a case like Wyoming v. Colorado, supra,where
the doctrine of appropriation applied in each of the States
which were parties to the suit and where there was not
sufficient water to meet all the present and prospective
needs.
Colorado's motion to dismiss is accordingly denied.
IV
Claim of United States to UnappropriatedWater. The
United States claims that it owns all the unappropriated
water in the river. It argues that it owned the then unappropriated water at the time it acquired water rights
by appropriation for the North Platte Project and the
Kendrick Project. Its basic rights are therefore said to
derive not from appropriation but from 'its underlying
ownership which entitles it to an apportionment in this
suit free from state control. The argument is that the
United States acquired the original ownership of all rights
in the water as well as the lands in the North Platte basin
by cessions from France, Spain and Mexico in 1803; 1819,
and 1848, and by agreement with Texas in 1850. It says
it still owns those rights in water to whatever extent it
has not disposed of them. An extensive review of federal
water legislation applicable to the Platte River basin is
made beginning with the Act of July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 251,
the Act of July 9, 1870, .16 Stat. 217 and including the
Desert Land Law (Act of March 3, 1877, 19 Stat. 377)

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

,nd the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388.
But we do not stop to determine what rights to unapproriated water of the river the United States may have.
For the water rights on which the North Platte Project
and the Kendrick Project rest have been obtained in compliance with state law. Whether they might have been
obtained by federal reservation is not important. Nor,
as we shall see, is it important to the decree to be entered
in this case that there may be unappropriated water to
which the United States may in the future assert rights
through the machinery of state law or otherwise.
The Desert Land Act "effected a severance of all waters
upon the public domain, not theretofore appropriated,
from the land itself." California Oregon Power Co. v.
Beaver Portland Cement Co., 295 U. S. 142, 158. It extended the right of appropriation to any declarant who
reclaimed desert land and provided: "all surplus water
over and above such actual appropriation and use, together with the water of all, lakes, rivers and other sources
of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable,
shall remain and be held free-for the appropriation and use
of the public for irrigation, mining and manufacturing
purposes subject to existing rights." See Ickes v. Fox,
300 U. S. 82, 95; Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S.352,
367.
Sec. 8 of the Reclamation Act provided: "That nothing
in this Act shall be construed as affecting or intended to
affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any State
or Territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or
distribution of water used in irrigation, or any vested right
acquired thereunder, and the Secretary of the Interior,in
carrying out the provisions of this Act, shall proceed in
conformity with such laws, and nothing herein shall in
any way affect any right of any State or of the Federal
Government or of any landowner, appropriator, or user of
water in, to, or from any interstate stream or the waters

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

thereof: Provided, That the right to the use of water acquired under the provisions of this Act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated,and beneficial use shall be the
basis, the measure, and the limit of the right." (Italics
added.)
The Secretary of the Interior pursuant to ยง 3 of the
Reclamation Act withdrew from public entry certain public lands in Nebraska and Wyoming which were required
for the North Platte Project and the Kendrick Project.
Initiation of both projects was accompanied by filings
made pursuant to ยง 8 in the name of the Secretary of the
Interior for and on behalf of the United States. Those
filings were accepted by the state officials as adequate under state law. They established the priority dates for the
projects. There were also applications to the States for
permits to construct canals and ditches. They described
the land to be served. The orders granting the applications fixed the time for completion of the canal, for application of the water to the land, and for proof of appropriation. Individual water users contracted with the
United States for the use of project water. These contracts were later assumed by the irrigation districts. Irrigation districts submitted proof of beneficial use to the
state authorities on behalf of the project water users. The
state authorities accepted that proof and issued decrees
and certificates in favor of the individual water users.
The certificates named as appropriators the individual
landowners. They designated the number of acres included, the use for which the appropriation was made,
the amount of the appropriation, and the priority date.
The contracts between the United States and the irrigation districts provided that after the stored water was
released from the reservoir it was under the control of the
appropriate state officials.
All of these steps make plain that those projects were
designed, constructed and completed according to the

614

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

pattern of state law as provided in the Reclamation Act.
We can say here what was said in Ickes v. Fox, supra, pp.
94-95: "Although the government diverted, stored and
distributed the water, the contention of petitioner that
thereby ownership of the water or water-rights became
vested in the United States is not well founded. Appropriation was made not for the use of the government, but,
under the Reclamation Act, for the use of the land owners; and by the terms of the law and of the contract already referred to, the water-rights became the property
of the land owners, wholly distinct from the property
right of the government in the irrigation works. Compare Murphy v. Kerr, 296 Fed. 536, 544, 545. The government was and remained simply a carrier and distributor
of the water (ibid.), with the right to receive the sums
stipulated in the contracts as reimbursement for the cost
of construction and annual charges for operation and
maintenance of the works."
The property right in the water right is separate and distinct from the property right in the reservoirs, ditches
or canals. The water right is appurtenant to the land,
the owner of which is the appropriator. The water right
is acquired by perfecting an appropriation, i. e., by an
actual diversion followed by an application within a reasonable time of the water to a beneficial use. See Murphy
v. Kerr, 296 F. 536, 542, 544, 545; Commonwealth Power
Co. v. State Board, 94 Neb. 613, 143 N. W. 937; Kersenbrock v. Boyes, 95 Neb. 407, 145 N. W. 837. Indeed ยง 8
of the Reclamation Act provides as we have seen that "the
right to the use of water acquired under the provisions of
this Act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated, and
beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit
of the right."
We have then a direction by Congress to the Secretary
of the Interior to proceed in conformity with state laws in
appropriating water for irrigation purposes. We have a

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

compliance with that direction. Pursuant to that procedure individual landowners have become the appropriators of the water rights, the United States being the storer
and the carrier." We intimate no opinion whether a different procedure might have been followed so as to appropriate and reserve to the United States all of these water
rights. No such attempt was made. Though we assume
arguendo that the United States did own all of the unappropriated water, the appropriations under state law were
made to the individual landowners pursuant to the procedure which Congress provided in the Reclamation Act.
The rights so acquired are as definite and complete as if
they were obtained by direct cession from the federal government. Thus even if we assume that the United States
owned the unappropriated rights, they were acquired by
the landowners in the precise manner contemplated by
Congress.
It is argued that if the right of the United States to
these water rights is not recognized, its management of
the federal projects will be jeopardized. It is pointed out,
for example, that Wyoming and Nebraska have laws which
regulate the charges which the owners of canals or reservoirs may make for the use of water. But our decision
does not involve those matters. We do not suggest that
where Congress has provided a system of regulation for
federal -projects it must give way before an inconsistent
state system. We are dealing here only with an allocation,
through the States, of water rights among appropriators.
The rights of the United States in respect to the storage
of water are recognized. So are the water rights of the
"The right of the United States as storer and carrier is not neces-.
sarily exhausted when it delivers the water to grantees under its irrigation projects. Thus in Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497 the right
of the United States was held to extend to water which resulted from
seepage from the irrigated lands under its project and which was not
susceptible of private appropriation under local law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.

325 U. S.

landowners. To allocate those water rights to the United
States would be to disregard the rights of the landowners.
To allocate them to the States, who-represent their citizens
parens patriae in this proceeding," in no wise interferes
with the ownership and operation by the United States of
its storage and power plants, works, and facilities. Thus
the question of the ownership by the United States of
unappropriated water is largely academic so far as the
narrow issues of this case are concerned.
V
There is some suggestion that if we undertake an apportionment 'of the waters of this interstate river, we
embark upon an enterprise involving administrative
functions beyond our province. We noted in Colorado v.
Kansas, supra, p. 392, that these controversies between
States over the waters of interstate streams "involve the
interests of quasi-sovereigns, present complicated and
delicate questions, and, due to the possibility of future
change of conditions, necessitate expert administration
rather than judicial imposition of a hard and fast rule.
Such controversies may appropriately be composed by
negotiation and agreement, pursuant to the compact
clause of the federal Constitution. We say of this case,
as the court has said of interstate differences of like nature,
that such mutual accommodation and agreement should,
if possible, be the medium of settlement, instead of invocation of our adjudicatory power." But the efforts at
settlement in this case have failed. A genuine controversy
exists. The gravity and importance of the case are apparent. The difficulties of drafting and enforcing a decree
are no justification for us to refuse to perform the important function entrusted to us by the Constitution. Those

Opinion of the Court.

considerations did not prevail in Wyoming v. Colorado,
supra, where an apportionment of the waters of an interstate stream was made. Nor did they prevail in the drainage canal cases. Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S.367, 281
U.S. 179,309 U. S. 569, 311 U.S. 107, 313 U. S.547. And
see Sanitary Districtv. United States, 266 U. S.405. We
do not believe they should prevail here.
We recognize the difficulties of the problem. The matter is a delicate one and extremely complex. To begin
with we are confronted with the problem of equitable
apportionment. The Special Master recomniended a decree based on that principle. That was indeed the principle adopted by the Court in Wyoming v. Colorado,supra,
where an apportionment of the waters of an interstate
stream was made between two States, each of which had
the rule of appropriation. In speaking of that rule in
application to a controversy between States the Court,
through Mr. Justice Van Devanter, said: "The cardinal
rule of the doctrine is that priority of appropriation gives
superiority of right. Each of these States applies and
enforces this rule in her own territory, and it is the one
to which intending appropriators naturally would turn
for guidance. The principle on which it proceeds is not
less applicable to interstate streams and controversies
than to others. Both States pronounce the rule just and
reasonable as applied to the natural conditions in that
region; and to prevent any departure from it the people
of both incorporated it into their constitutions. It originated in the customs and usages of the people before
either State came into existence, and the courts of both
hold that their constitutional provisions are to be taken
as recognizing the prior usage rather than as creating a
new rule. These considerations persuade us that its application to such a controversy as is here presented cannot
be other than eminently just and equitable to all concerned." 259 U. S. p. 470. And see Wyoming v. Colorado,

286 U. S. 494; Washington v. Oregon, 297 U. S. 517, 526.
Since Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska are appropriation States, that principle would seem to be equally applicable here.
That does not mean that there must be a literal application of the priority rule. We stated in Colorado v.
Kansas, supra, that in determining whether one State is
"using, or threatening to use, more than its equitable share
of the benefits of a stream, all the factors which create
equities in favor of one State or the other must be weighed
as of the date when the controversy is mooted." 320 U. S.
p. 394. That case did not involve a controversy between
two appropriation States. But if an allocation between
appropriation States is to be just and equitable, strict
adherence to the priority rule may not be possible. For
example, the economy of a region may have been established on the basis of junior appropriations. So far as
possible those established uses should be protected though
strict application of the priority rule might jeopardize
them. Apportionment calls for the exercise of an informed judgment on a consideration of many factors.
Priority of appropriation is the guiding principle. But
physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of
water in the several sections of the river, the character
and rate of return flows, the extent of established uses, the
availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, the damage to upstream
areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if
a limitation is imposed on the former-these are all relevant factors. They are merely an illustrative, not an
exhaustive catalogue. They indicate the nature of the
problem of apportionment- and the delicate adjustment
of interests which must be made..
Practical considerations of this order underlie Nebraska's concession that the priority rule should not be
strictly applied to appropriations in Colorado, though

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.

Opinion of the Court.

some are junior to the priorities of appropriators in Wyoming and Nebraska. As the Special Master points out,
the flowage time of water from North Park to Bridgeport,
Nebraska is between two and three weeks. If a canal in
North Park were closed to relieve the shortage of a senior
appropriator in Nebraska, it would be highly speculative
whether the water would reach the Nebraska appropriator
in time or whether the closing of the Colorado canal would
work more hardship there than it would bestow benefits
in Nebraska. Moreover, there is loss of water in transit
from the upper to the downstream sections, increasing
with the distance. The lower appropriator thus receives
less than the upper appropriator loses. And there is evidence that a river-wide priority system would disturb and
disrupt long-established uses.
Nebraska, however, urges that priority of appropriation
interstate be adopted from the Alcova Reservoir east and
more particularly from the Whalen diversion dam east.
She points out that there is a large acreage of Nebraska
land which is irrigated by canals diverting at Whalen.
There are four canals diverting in Wyoming and irrigating
land entirely or in part in Nebraska-Mitchell, Interstate,
Ft. Laramie and French. For example, the diversion
point for Mitchell is in Wyoming though all the land it
serves is in Nebraska. Nebraska has maintained that
diversions of that canal should be regulated to observe the
priorities of senior Nebraska canals including Tri-State.
Wyoming was willing to regulate her upstream junior
appropriators for the benefit of Mitchell provided the
water go to Mitchell and not be used for Tri-State which
is senior to both Mitchell and certain Wyoming appropriators. 8 Nebraska therefore urges an interstate allocation which would require junior appropriators in Wyo-

ming to respect not only Mitchell's priorities but also those
of Tri-State and other Nebraska canals in this section of
the river.
The United States takes substantially the same position
on this matter as Nebraska except that it argues that a
priority allocation interstate be confined to that area
between Whalen and Tri-State Dam.
Wyoming contends for a system of mass allocation between the States, saying that no attempt can or should be
made in this proceeding to determine the priorities interstate of the various appropriators in each State. The proposal of Wyoming envisages distribution of natural flow
and storage water indiscriminately as a common fund to
all users. It is based on the theory that there is a sufficiency of water for everyone.
The decree recommended by the Special Master departs
from the theory of allocation advanced by the parties.
In recommending his apportionment the Special Master
did not rest on the long-time average flow of the river. We
have discussed the drought which has persisted in this
river basin since 1930. No one knows whether it has run
its course or whether it represents a new norm. There is
no reliable basis for prediction. But a controversy.exists;
and the decree which- is entered must deal with conditions
as they obtain today. If they substantially change, the
decree can be adjusted to meet the new conditions. But
the decree which is fashioned must be based, as the Special
Master recognized, on the dependable flow. Wyoming v.
Colorado, supra. In that case the Court pointed out that
the average of all years was far from being a proper measure of the available supply. "An intending irrigator acquiring a water right based on such a measure would be
almost certainly confronted with drought when his need
for water was greatest. Crops cannot be grown on expectations of average flows which do not come, nor on recollections of unusual flows which have passed down the
stream in prior years." 259 U. S. p. 476. On this record

NEBRASKA t. WYOMING:
589

Opinion of the Court.

we cannot say that the dependable flow is greater than the
average condition which has prevailed since 1930. For
reasons which we discuss at a later point in this opinion,
we deal only with natural flow, not with storage water
as Wyoming urges. On the basis of the conditions which
have obtained since 1930, it is plain that the natural
flow of the river during the irrigation season has been
over-appropriated.
Colorado. As we have noted, there are presently under
irrigation in this section of the river 131.,800 acres which
consume (including reservoir evaporation) 98,540 acre
feet annually. Exportations from the basin amount on
the average to 6,000 acre feet, making the total annual
depletion 104,540 acre feet. There are, as we have seen,
additional demands made by Colorado for future projects. The Special Master recommended that Colorado
be enjoined (a) from the diversion of water for the irrigation in North Park of more than 135,000 acres of land,
(b) from the accumulation in storage facilities in North
Park of more than 17,000 acre feet between October 1 of
any year and September 30 of the following year, and (c)
from the transbasin diversion out of North Park of more
than 6,000 acre feet between October 1 of any year and
September 30 of the following year. Colorado excepts to
these proposals. But with minor exceptions which we will
note, we do not believe those exceptions'are well taken
We are satisfied that a reduction in present Color.-.do
uses is not warranted. The fact that the same amount of
water might produce more in lower sections of the river
is immaterial. Wyoming v. Colorado,supra, p. 468. The
established economy in Colorado's section of the river
basin based on existing use of the water should be protected.1' Cf. Coloradov. Kansas, supra,p. 394. Appropriators in Colorado junior to Pathfinder have made out-of14

325 U. S.

priority diversions of substantial amounts. Strict application of the priority rule might well result in placing a
limitation on Colorado's present use for the benefit of
Pathfinder. But as we have said, priority of appropriation, while the guiding principle for an apportionment,
is not a hard and fast rule. Colorado's countervailing
equities indicate it should not be strictly adhered to in
this situation. Colorado asserts, however, that the limitation of transbasin diversions to 6,000 acre feet a year
should not be imposed. Her point is that 6,000 acre feet
represent merely the average annual transbasin diversions, that annual diversions have exceeded that amount,
and that a limitation of 6,000 acre feet annually will interfere with existing Colorado users. We think the point
is well taken. The decree will enjoin Colorado exportations in excess of an average of 6,000 acre feet computed
over a period of ten years. 5
But Colorado's other exceptions to the suggested limitations to be placed on her use of the water of the North
Platte are not sustained. The principal argument is that
on the basis of the long-time averages there is enough
water to go around, that no limitation on use is warranted,
and that the proposed limitation is a deprivation suffered
by Colorado for the benefit of downstream users. But
that argument fails if we assume, as we must on the evidence before us, that the dependable supply does not exceed the amount of water which has been available since
1930. Nor can we see how existing projects can be protected on the basis of the 1931-1940 supply if additional
projects in Colorado are permitted. If at any time additional projects are threatened in downstream areas, Colorado may make complaint. If conditions of supply substantially change, any party can apply for modification of

the decree. The decree will not necessarily be for all time.
Provision will be made for its adjustment to meet substantially changed conditions. Nor will the decree interfere with relationships among Colorado's water users.
The relative rights of the appropriators are subject to
Colorado's control.
Colorado finally says that the proposed restriction on
her uses of the water violate the Act of August 9, 1937, 50
Stat. 564, 595, which appropriated funds for the Kendrick
Project. That Act provided that "in recognition of the respective rights of both the States of Colorado and Wyoming to the amicable use of the waters of the North Platte
River, neither the construction, maintenance, nor operation of said (Kendrick) project shall ever interfere with
the present vested rights or the fullest use hereafter for all
beneficial purposes of the waters of said stream or any
of its tributaries within the drainage basin thereof in
Jackson County, in the State of Colorado, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed
to reserve the power by contract to enforce such provisions at all times." But that Act does not limit or restrict
Nebraska's or Wyoming's claim for apportionment against
Colorado. Moreover, the Kendrick Project under present
conditions (which are the basis of the decree) could store
no water without violating other priorities. If the longtime average conditions return, it can do so. Only at that
time could there be a possible conflict with the policy of
Congress contained in the Act of August 9, 1937. If that
condition arises and a conflict with Colorado's interests
appear imminent, it will be time to consider the problem.
Colorado State Line to Pathfinderand Guernsey. The
Special Master recommends that Wyoming be enjoined
(a) from diverting water from the main river above
.Quernsey and from its tributaries above Pathfinder for
the irrigation of more than 168,000 acres, and (b) from
the accumulation of storage water in reservoirs above
Pathfinder in excess of 18,000 acre feet between October

325 U.S.

1 of any year and September 30 of the following year.
We deem this restriction appropriate provided the limitation of storage above Pathfinder does not include Seminoe Reservoir which lies above Pathfinder and which is
to be the main source of supply for the Kendrick Project.
As we have noted, most of the land under irrigation in the
section above Pathfinder is irrigated from tributaries.
The rights are small but very numerous. The total acreage under irrigation is 153,000 acres, allowing for a margin
of error. Below Pathfinder and above Guernsey the
Special Master dealt only with diversions from the main
river. He concluded that the run-off of the tributaries
becomes so far exhausted before any shortage of water
occurs in the main river that any regulation of the tributary diversions would be of no material benefit. The
tributary inflow is greater than the depletion of the river.
There is some out-of-priority diversion as we have noted.
But possibilities for future developments are largely nonexistent. The Special Master concluded that if Wyoming
were limited to the irrigation of 15,000 acres (which is the
extent of present irrigation with a margin of error) natural
conditions would militate against this section getting more
than its equitable share of the water.
We think that is a practical and fair adjustment. So
far as the tributaries above Pathfinder are concerned,
practical difficulties of applying restrictions which would
reduce the amount of water used by the hundreds of small
irrigators would seem to outweigh any slight benefit which
senior appropriators might obtain. This does not seem to
be denied. And the conditions which obtain on the main
river between Pathfinder and Guernsey support the limitation without more to the irrigation of 15,000 acres.
The United States, however, insists that some. regulation of the tributaries between Pathfinder and Guernsey
is essential. It claims that there are possibilities of future
additional storage on these tributaries and that if future
storage is increased there will be a reduction in tributary

flows into the main river available for storage in the
Guernsey, Lake Alice and Lake Minatare reservoirs of the
North Platte Project. We do not know from the present
record the precise extent of existing reservoir storage in
this area. We do know, however, that there is some storage capacity, e. g. 20,000 acre feet in the La Prele Project.
In absence of evidence showing what contribution these
tributaries now make to the supply of the reservoirs or
what additional storage projects may be possible or what
their effect might be, the Special Master concluded there
was an insufficient basis for any present limitation on storage. We find no evidence of any present threat to the
water supply from this source. If such threat appears and
it promises to disturb the delicate balance of the river,
application may be made at the foot of the decree for an
appropriate restriction.

Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

We have noted the priorities of Pathfinder and Guernsey, as well as those of the Kendrick Project. We have
noted that their priorities make them junior to many
downstream appropriators including the State Line Canals. While the four reservoirs in question are Wyoming
appropriators, Pathfinder and Guernsey were designed
more for the benefit of Nebraska than of Wyoming lands.
Recognition of the priorities interstate makes obvious the
propriety of an interstate apportionment.
Wyoming objects to this treatment of the Kendrick
Project. As we have said, she contends for a mass allocation of water between Nebraska and Wyoming under
which a diversion requirement of 168,000 acre feet should
be allotted for the Kendrick Project. Wyoming has presented a detailed analysis of the water supply of the river
on the basis of which it is argued that the flow during the
period since 1930 is not the true measure of the dependable supply. It is urged that the long-time averages must
be considered in computing the dependable supply and if
"they are and if the storage capacity of these reservoirs is
added to the natural flow, the dependable supply will be
increased. Moreover, Wyoming argues that no allocation
can-be made to individual appropriators in any of the
States because they are not parties and cannot be bound
in their absence.
We have carefully considered these contentions of Wyoming and have concluded that they do not warrant a departure from the method of allocation proposed by the
Special Master. On the record before us we are not justified in assuming that there will be a greater supply than
haa been available during the 1931-1940 period. To base
the decree on a larger supply would not be to base it on
a dependable supply. Under those conditions Kendrick
can store no water. Even with reservoir regulation we are
not convinced that Wyoming has shown an adequate supply to justify the allocation she seeks. The combined

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.

Opinion of the Court.

storage capacity of the North Platte and Kendrick projects is equal to 175 per cent of the long-time annual average river run-off of the river at Pathfinder. We have here
storage capacity in excess of the practicable limits of a
dependable supply as that term has hitherto been construed. Wyoming v. Colorado, supra.
A mass allocation was made in Wyoming v. Colorado.
But there is no hard and fast rule which requires it in all
cases. The standard of an equitable apportionment requires an adaptation of the formula to the necessities of
the particular situation. We may assume that therights
of the appropriators inter se may not be adjudicated in
their absence. But any allocation between Wyoming
and Nebraska, if it is to be fair and just, must reflect the
priorities of appropriators in the two States. Unless the
priorities of the downstream canals senior to the four
reservoirs and Casper Canal are determined, no allocation
is possible. The determination of those priorities for the
limited purposes of this interstate apportionment is accordingly justified. The equitable share of a State may
be determined in this litigation with such limitations as
the equity of the situation requires and irrespective of
the indirect effect which that determination may have on
individual rights within the State. Hinderlider v. La
PlataCo., 304 U. S.92, 106-108.
Nebraska contends that the allotment to Farmers Irrigation District be increased in the seasonal limitation
recommended, so that the Warren Act contract which it
has may be recognized. But for reasons which we will
elaborate the only water subject to the present allocation
is natural flow. Contracts requiring the supplementation
of natural flow by storage are unaffected. 8
18 Whether, as between the United States together with the irrigation projects sponsored by it on the one hand and the Farmers Irrigation District on the other, the United States is estopped by United
States v. Tilley, 124 F. 2d 850, to deny the amount of acreage covered
by the Warren Act contract with the district is not relevant here.

628

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

The United States contends that Nebraska's equitable
share of natural flow water should be limited to that which
is in fact being diverted and used by any or all of the
designated canals within the specified limitations in acrefeet and second-feet. It is said that these provisions of
the proposed decree are the operative provisions which
determine the amount of natural flow to be passed into
the Whalen-Tri-State Dam section of the river. It is said
that Nebraska can permit, as it has heretofore, water to
pass the Tri-State Dam for use below that point even
though her equitable share is calculated only on the basis
of the needs of appropriators at or above Tri-State. Anq
it is pointed out that the lands served by diversions below
Tri-State have no equitable claim on water originating in
Wyoming or Colorado, their needs being reasonably met
by local supplies. We think, as we will develop later, that
the record sustains the conclusion that equitable apportionment does not permit Nebraska to demand direct
flow water from above Whalen for use below Tri-State.
The reservoirs above Whalen may store water and Kendrick may divert whenever and to the extent that the
Nebraska canals at or above Tri-State are not using or
diverting natural flow. We do not believe, however, that
any revision of this part of the proposed decree need be
made. We cannot assume that Nebraska will undertake
to circumvent the decree. Moreover, the proposed revision offers difficulties. As Nebraska points out, when a
junior Nebraska canal having storage rights is closed to
natural flow due to operation of Nebraska priorities, it
should be allowed to make up the deficiency in its supply
in relation to its requirements by asking for storage water
under such contracts as it may have with the United
States. The United States does not repudiate those contracts. We conclude that it would unduly complicate the
decree to recast its provisions so as to take them into account. If, as the United States fears, the decree is admin-

Opinion of the Court.

istered so as to divert water from above Tri-State to the
use of those diverting below Tri-State, application for
appropriate relief may be made at the foot of the decree.
The United States asserts that it should be given a separate allocation of water even if it is not treated as the
owner of unappropriated water and hence the possessor
of an unbroken chain of title to project water. The Special Master concluded that the position of the United
States or the Secretary of the Interior is that of an appropriator of water for storage under the laws of Wyoming
and that its interests are represented in that connection
by Wyoming. That was in line with the ruling of this
Court when Wyoming moved to dismiss this very case
on the ground, among others, that the Secretary of the
Interior was a necessary party. Nebraska v. Wyoming,
295 U. S. 40, 43. The Court said: "The bill alleges, and
we know as matter of law, that the Secretary and his
agents, acting by authority of the Reclamation Act and
supplementary legislation, must obtain permits and priorities for the use of water from the State of Wyoming in
the same manner as a private appropriator or an irrigation district formed under the state law. His rights can
rise no higher than those of Wyoming, and an adjudication of the defendant's rights will necessarily bind him.
Wyoming will stand in judgment for him as for any other
appropriator in that state. He is not a necessary party."
We have discussed the procedure of appropriation which
has been followed in this region. The Secretary of the
Interior made the appropriations under Wyoming law.
But we have noted that the water rights were adjudicated
to be in the individual landowners. Hence, so far as tne
water rights are concerned, we think it is not proper to
analogize this case to one where the United States acquires property within a State and asserts its title against
the State as well as others.
The United States claims that it is at least entitled to be
recognized as the owner of the storage water with full

control over its disposition and use under Wyoming law.
That seems to be true under Wyoming law. Wyo., Rev.
Stats. (1931) ยงยง 122-1601, 122-1602; Scherck v. Nichols,
55 Wyo. 4, 19, 95 P. 2d 74. The decree which is entered
will in no way cloud such claim as it has to storage water
under Wyoming law; nor will the decree interfere with
the ownership and operation by the United States of the
various federal storage and power plants, works, and facilities. We repeat that the decree is restricted to an apportionment of the natural flow.
The decree will, however, place a restraint on the storage of water in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe and Alcova Reservoirs, so as to protect the Nebraska lands served
by the French Canal and the State Line Canals which
are senior. The United States points out that if Nebraska
permits some of the natural flow to go below the Tri-State
Dam, as it may do, thus causing certain of the State Line
Canals to go short, those canals would be entitled to have
any deficiencies replaced by the United States under Warren Act contracts. It says that under the proposed decree
only storage water and not natural flow could be supplied
and unless storage water is appropriately defined by the
decree, it might not be possible to meet the contract requirements without violation of the limitations on natural
flow which are fixed by the decree. And it says that that
would be the result if storage water were defined to exclude all water passed through a reservoir at any time
as great as or greater than its outflow.
when its inflow is.
Nebraska recognizes the desirability of that course. She
contends, however, that where the outflow is equal to or
less than the intake, none of the released water can be
considered as storage water. And she says.that when the
water being released is greater than the inflow, that portion which represents the amount of natural flow being
taken in at the intakes cannot be considered as storage.
See Gila Valley IrrigationDist. v. United States, 118 F.

Opinion of the Court.

2d 507. She says that the United States by its proposal is
attempting to transform into storage water what is in fact
natural flow originating above the reservoirs.
For reasons which will be more fully discussed, we think
that storage water should be left for distribution in accordance with the contracts which govern it. Accordingly, we
think it is advisable to define storage water in the manner
proposed by the United States, so as to make the operation of the decree more certain and to adjust it to the
storage water contracts which are outstanding. Storage
water therefore is defined for purposes of this decree as
any water which is released from reservoirs for use on
lands under canals having storage contracts in addition
to the water which is discharged through those reservoirs
to meet the requirements of any canal as recognized in
the decree. This definition does not adversely affect rights
recognized in the decree. It is perhaps a departure from
the ordinary meaning of storage. But so long as the Warren Act contracts are outstanding that definition is necessary in order to give them effectiveness. For they do not
provide that the United States will furnish water in such
amounts as may from time to time be available. The
United States agrees to deliver water which will, with all
the water to which the land is entitled by appropriation
or otherwise, aggregate a stated amount."
17

Thus the contract with the Gering Irrigation District provides:

"The United States will impound, and store water in the Pathfinder
Reservoir, or elsewhere and release the same into the North Platte

River at such times and in sufficient quantities to deliver, and does
hereby agree to deliver at the Wyoming-Nebraska State line for the

use of said District an amount of water which will, with all the water
the lands of the District may be entitled to by reason of any appropriations and all water not otherwise appropriated, including drainage and seepage waters developed by the United States, aggregate
a flow of water as follows: [Here follows the delivery schedule]; the
total amount to be so delivered being approximately 35,500 acre
feet."

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

There are other exceptions of a minor character to this
part of the decree. We have considered them and conclude that they do not have merit.
Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe and Alcova Reservoirs.
The Special Master recommends that Wyoming be enjoined to respect the rule of priority of these reservoirs
in respect to each other and that the order of seniority
as between them be defined as follows: (1) Pathfinder,
(2) Guernsey, (3) Seminoe, and (4) Alcova. He recommends, however, that water be allowed to be impounded
in Seminoe "out of priority" in relation to Pathfinder and
Guernsey for such use only in the generation of power
by the Seminoe hydroelectric power plant as will not
materially interfere with the administration of the water
for irrigation purposes according to the priority as decreed
for the French Canal and the State Line Canals.
The United States contends that the decree should permit joint operation of the federal reservoirs without reference to priorities among themselves or among the lands
which they serve, in the event of an appropriate adjustment of storage contracts. Concededly the various storage water contracts, including Warren Act contracts,
preclude joint operation of Seminoe and Pathfinder. The
Special Master also concluded that joint operation would
raise questions concerning rights under Wyoming natural
flow appropriations senior to Seminoe but junior to Pathfinder. It may be that the latter problem would not be
difficult. For as the United States suggests, under joint
operation the reservoirs could operate on the Pathfinder
priority until they had the combined storage equivalent
to Pathfinder. Thereafter they would store no water
except such as is needed for appropriations having priorities senior to Seminoe. Since joint operation, however,
could not be presently instituted-but would have to wait
modifications of outstanding contracts, we think it best
to defer consideration of the proposal until joint operation

in fact and in law is permissible. The decree will be
without prejudice to the parties to make application for
joint operation whenever changed conditions make it
possible.
The Interstate, Ft. Laramie, and Northport canals are,
as we have noted, part of the North Platte Project. The
Kendrick Project is subordinate to the North Platte
Project. The Special Master concluded that proper regulation for Kendrick would be one requiring the observance of priorities, Alcova to Tri-State Dam, both in the
storage of water in Seminoe and Alcova and in the diversion of natural flow by the Casper Canal. The record
supports that conclusion. Nebraska accordingly urges
that the Interstate, Ft. Laramie, and Northport canals receive the same protection from Kendrick as the French
Canal and the State Line Canals. If there were doubt
that Interstate, Ft. Laramie, and Northport would receive priority in treatment, the decree could be fashioned
so as to provide for it. But the matter is covered by contract between the United States and the Casper-Alcova
Irrigation District. That contract, which the United
States fully recognizes, precludes operation of the Kendrick Project except in recognition of prior rights in the
North Platte Project.18 We therefore do not think it is
necessary to include in the decree the additional provision
which Nebraska suggests.
Return Flow of Kendrick Project. The Special Master
recommends that Wyoming be enjoined (1) from the recapture of return flow water of the Kendrick Project after
The contract provides:
"It is expressly agreed that the development of the Casper-Alcova
Project and the irrigation, of lands under it is in no way to impair
the water rights for the Federal North Platte Reclamation Project in
Wyoming and Nebraska, and the said North Platte Project, and Warren Act contractors under it are to receive a water supply of the same
quantity as would have been received if the Casper-Alcova Project had
not been constructed and operated."

it shall have reached the North Platte River and become
commingled with the general flow of the river, and (2)
from diverting water from the river at or above Alcova
Reservoir as in lieu of Kendrick return flow water
reaching the river below Alcova.
The United States points out that the first part of this
restriction may be construed to forbid Wyoming diverters
from making the same use of Kendrick return flow water
as is permitted Nebraska diverters. Natural flow in this
case is used throughout as including return flow. Return
flows once returned to the river and abandoned are part
of the natural flow available for use by all natural flow
diverters within the limitations of the apportionment. To
avoid any possible misunderstanding, there should be
substituted for the first clause of this proposed provision
a clause which makes clear that return flows of the Kendrick Project are, for purposes of the decree, deemed to be
natural flows when they have reached the North Platte
River.
The question whether the United States may divert
water from the river at or above Alcova Reservoir as in
lieu of Kendrick return flow water reaching the river
below Alcova presents complexities. Both the United
States and Wyoming contend that that privilege should
be granted. The return flow is estimated at 96,000 acre
feet a year, 46,000 acre feet being the estimated return
during the irrigation season. Some of that return flow
will be natural drainage, some will be from sump areas,
already noted, from which the United States will construct
drainage ditches and thus return to the river water which
would otherwise be lost. How much will be returned by
natural drainage and how much from the sump areas is
not presently known, since the Kendrick Pnoject is not
completed.
We will consider first the return flow from natural
drainage. Ide v. United States, 263 U. S. 497, held that

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

the United States might recapture water which resulted
from seepage from irrigated lands under a reclamation
project and which was not susceptible of private appropriation under Wyoming law. The same conclusion was
reached in United States v. Tilley, 124 F. 2d 850, where the
United States was held to be entitled to use and apply the
seepage from one division of the North Platte Project to
supply lands of another division as against the claim of
Nebraska of a right to intercept the seepage and apply it
to appropriators senior to the project. And see Ramshorn
Ditch Co. v. United States, 269 F. 80. Cf. United States
v. Warmsprings IrrigationDist., 38 F. Supp. 239. In the
Ide case this Court said:
"The seepage producing the artificial flow is part of the
water which the plaintiff, in virtue of its appropriation,
takes from the Shoshone River and conducts to the project
lands in the vicinity of the ravine for use in their irrigation. The defendants insist that when water is once used
under the appropriation it cannot be used again,-that
the right to use it is exhausted. But we perceive no
ground for thinking the appropriation is thus restricted.
According to the record it is intended to cover, and does
cover, the reclamation and cultivation of all the lands
within the project. A second use in accomplishing that
object is as much within the scope of the appropriation as
a first use is. The state law and the National Reclamation Act both contemplate that the water shall be so conserved that it may be subjected to the largest practicable
use. A further contention is that the plaintiff sells the
water before it is used, and therefore has no right in the
seepage. But the water is not sold. In disposing of the
lands in small parcels, the plaintiff invests each purchaser
with a right to have enough water supplied from the
project canals to irrigate his land, but it does not give up all
control over the water or to do more than pass to the purchaser a right to use the water so far as may be necessary

325 U. S.

in properly cultivating his land. Beyond this all rights
incident to the appropriation are retained by the plaintiff. Its right in the seepage is well illustrated by the following excerpt from the opinion of District Judge Dietrich
in United States v. Haga, 276 Fed. 41, 43:
"'One who by the expenditure of money and labor
diverts appropriable water from a stream, and thus makes
it available for fruitful purposes, is entitled to its exclusive control so long as he is able and willing to apply it to
beneficial uses, and such right extends to what is commonly known as wastage from surface run-off and deep
percolation, necessarily incident to practical irrigation.
Considerations of both public policy and natural justice
strongly support such a rule. Nor is it essential to his
control that the appropriator maintain continuous actual
possession of such water. So long as he does not abandon
it or forfeit it by failure to use, he may assert his rights.
It is not necessary that he confine it upon his own land or
convey it in an artificial conduit. It is requisite, of course,
that he be able to identify it; but, subject to that limitation, he may conduct it through natural channels and may
even commingle it or suffer it to commingle with other
waters. In short, the rights of an appropriator in these
respects are not affected by the fact that the water has
once been used.'" 263 U. S. pp. 505-506.
If that principle were literally applied, the United
States could reclaim the return flows 200 miles downstream
from Kendrick at Whalen where they could be diverted to
the Interstate or Ft. Laramie Canal. Or if not reclaimed
there, the return flows could be applied below the Nebraska
line to Warren Act contract requirements. The Special
Master thought any such program would be so disruptive
of orderly administration as to be intolerable. That, of
course, is not the proposal. The proposal is to divert water
at or above Alcova in lieu of the return flows from Kendrick below Alcova. But we think the proposal is basically

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

not in accord with the principle underlying the Ide case.
That principle is that although the water rights belong to
the landowners, the owner of the irrigation project has
an interest in the appropriative rights to the extent of
obtaining the fullest use of the water for the project. It
may, therefore, retain control over the water until abandonment. We think it goes too far to say that when the
return flows are abandoned, they may nevertheless be exchanged for upstream diversions by the same amount.
When the return flows are abandoned, they become subject
to appropriation down stream. See 2 Kinney, Irrigation
and Water Rights (2d ed. 1912) ยง 1114. They no longer
remain subject to control for further use in the project.
Any claim to them or their equivalent under the form of
an "in lieu of" diversion is lost.
When it comes, however, to return flows resulting from
drainage facilities installed by the United States, different
considerations may be applicable. But for the drainage
through artificial channels furnished by the United States,
the unused water would never return to the river. The
United States could rightfully leave the water in the
sumps. In that case, no one would ever have the use of
it. It is argued that since by artificial drainage the United
States adds to the natural flow below Kendrick, it is only
fair to allow Kendrick whatever benefit may result from
that contribution. Cf. Reno v. Richards, 32 Ida. 1, 178
P. 81. One difficulty is that the drainage system has not
been completed, Kendrick has not been put into operation, and we do not know what the contribution by artificial drainage will be. Accordingly, we do not at this time
consider the claim on the merits. When Kendrick has
been put into operation and there is a full development
of return flows, application may be made for revision of
the decree to permit "in lieu of" diversions at or above
Alcova.

ters around it and around the Special Master's proposal
for dealing with it. He proposes that the natural flow
water in this section between May 1 and September'30
each year be apportioned on the basis of 25 per cent to
Wyoming and 75 per cent to Nebraska. He recommends
that Nebraska be given the right to designate from time
to time the portion of its share which shall be delivered
to the Interstate, Ft. Laramie, French and Mitchell Canals for use on Nebraska lands served by them and that
Wyoming be enjoined from diversions contrary to this
apportionment. 9
None of the parties agrees to this apportionment.
Wyoming earnestly contends that storage water as well
as natural flow should be included in the apportionment
which is made for this section of the river. She points
out that in Wyoming v. Colorado, supra, the Court made
an apportionment based upon a supply "which is fairly
constant and dependable, or is susceptible of being made
so by storage and conservation within practicable limits."
259 U. S. p. 480. She argues that the Court has the power
to allocate storage water though its disposition is controlled
by contracts between the United States and irrigation districts; and that an apportionment which excludes storage water is unfair. The argument is that each State
should be restricted to the use of such supplies only as
are necessary to provide their respective irrigators, in10 He likewise recommends (1) that in the apportionment of water
in this section the flow for each day, until ascertainable, shall be assumed to be the same as that of the preceding day as shown by the
measurements and computations for that day; and (2) that in the
segregation of natural flow and storage water, reservoir evaporation
and transportation losses shall be determined in accordance with the
formula and data which appear in the record identified as United
States Exhibit 204Ak;unless and until Nebraska, Wyoming, and the
United States may agree upon a modification thereof or upon another
formula. We 'discuss the, second of these recommendations later in
this opinion. Wi" adopt both of them.

cluding those receiving water under contracts, with such
amounts as are necessary for beneficial use. The large
excesses diverted by Nebraska are adverted to as showing the degree to which carry-over storage in the upper
reservoirs has been diminished and the supply for Kendrick exhausted.
The Special Master concluded that since the North
Platte Project storage water was disposed of under contracts between the United States and landowners under
the project and under the Warren Act contracts, the obligations of those contracts and the necessity of performance under them must be recognized by the decree. He
concluded, however, that in the allocation of the natural
flow the storage water available might bear upon the
equities of the States, although it would have no relevancy
to the legal rights of individual appropriators inter se
under the law of either Wyoming or Nebraska. We think
the equities of the case support the failure to include
storage water in the apportionment. We do not reach the
question whether the presence of the storage water contracts would preclude an apportionment of storagewater.
The nine Wyoming private canals and the Mitchell and
Ramshorn canals have no contract rights to receive
storage water from the federal reservoirs. It is difficult
for us to see how it would be equitable to make an apportionment on the basis that they do. In certain years in
the past there have been excessive diversions by canals in
this section, including the nine Wyoming private canals.
We cannot assume that an apportionment of storage water
is necessary to prevent a recurrence of those practices.
Certainly an apportionment' of storage water, would disrupt the system of water administration which has 'become
established pursuant to mandate of Congress in ยง 8 of
the Reclamation Act that the Secretary of the Interior
in the construction of these federal projects should proceed in conformity with state law. In pursuance thereto

325 U. S.

all of the storage water is disposed of under contracts with

project users and Warren Act canals. It appears that
under that system of administration of storage water no
State and no water users within a State are entitled to the
use of storage facilities or storage water unless they contract for the use. See Wyo. Rev. Stats. (1931), ยงยง 1221504, 122-1508, 122-1602. If storage water is not segregated, storage water contractors in times of shortage of
the total supply will be deprived of the use of a part of
the storage supply for which they pay. If storage water
is not segregated, those who have not contracted for the
storage supply will receive at the expense of those who
have contracted for it a substantial increment to the
natural flow supply which, as we have seen, has been insufficient to go around. In Wyoming v. Colorado, supra,
the Court did not apportion storage water. It apportioned
natural flow only. It took into account when it made that
apportionment the effects of storage in equalizing natural
flow in Wyoming. We think no more should be done here
to effect an equitable apportionment.
We have already noted the exceptional features of this
section-the great concentration of demand in a short,
compact area, the distinctly interstate scope and character
of water distribution, with Wyoming appropriations
serving Nebraska uses, with the dependence of Nebraska
canals on Wyoming diversions, with the joint use of canals
to serve both States. There has been no effective interstate administration. The need to treat the section as an
administrative unit without regard to state lines seems
apparent. The Special Master concluded that the most
feasible method of apportionment would be a distribution
of natuial flow on a percentage of daily flow basis.
If a division of flow were made according to total acreage, total requirements, or acreage or requirements of
senior and junior appropriators, it would be as follows:

Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

It is thus apparent that whether a division be proportioned to total acreage or to total diversion requirements
or be made on a strict priority basis, there would be no
substantial difference except as to the first 1,500 second
feet. The maximum difference as to other water would
be 6%.
Wyoming argues for a mass allocation, e. g. 705,000 acre
feet to be allocated to Nebraska for diversion in this section during the irrigation season for Nebraska lands. The
Special Master rejected that method. He concluded that
it was based on an assumption of dependability of flow
which would be bound to result in injustice to one or other
of the States; that it apportioned not only natural flow
but also storage water, the disposition of which is governed by contracts. We have already considered Wyoming's exception that storage water should have been
included in the allocation. We have also considered the
other phases of her argument in favor of mass allocation.
We repeat that the inadequacy of the supply is too clear to
permit adoption of Wyoming's formula.
The United States and Nebraska claim that the adoption of a priority schedule in this section would achieve
the most equitable results. On a 25-75 percentage basis,
Nebraska would get 75 second feet out of the first 100, to
none of which she would be entitled in times of an extreme
low flow; Wyoming would get 225 second feet out of the
next 900 to none of which she would be entitled on a priority basis. A priority basis would only coincide with the
percentage basis when the supply available was 400 second
feet or 1,500 second feet. If the supply were 800 second
feet, a priority basis would give Wyoming 103 second feet
and Nebraska the remaining 697 second feet. On the
25-75 percentage basis, Wyoming would receive 200 second feet and Nebraska 600 second feet. It is argued that
the unfairness of the proposed apportionment is demonstrated by the record of the low flow of the river in this
section during the irrigation season in 1931-1940 period.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

Thus in 1932 the flow never rose above 1,500 second feet
after August 10th. In the 1934 season it rose above 1,500
second feet only once after June 10th. And in the 1936
season it was not often over 1,500 second feet. In 1932,
1934 and 1936 the direct flow frequently fell below 1,000
second feet. In 1934 it rose above 800 second feet for
only about 33 days during the entire season and was below
400 second feet about 34 days. In 1936 it was below 1,000
second feet for over 50 days during the season and below
800 second feet about 28 days. The argument is that fluctuation in the rights to water is inherent in the priority
system and that the. percentage apportionment of 25-75 is
too rigid and does not give sufficient recognition to that
fact. The frequency with which the flow has dropped
below 1,500 second feet during the drought and the inequities which result if a strict priority apportionment is not
made at such times are emphasized.
The United States and Nebraska advance as their preferred alternative a strict priority apportionment in which
the rights of each appropriator would be fixed. Wyoming
says that may not be done since the appropriators are not
parties to this proceeding. The Special Master had serious doubts on that score. He also felt that an interstate
priority schedule for this section, while not open to all the
objections which would be present if it were applied to
the whole river, would have other objections. Those were
(1) that it would deprive each State of full freedom of intrastate administration of her share of the water and (2)
that it would burden the decree with administrative detail beyond what is necessary to an equitable apportionment. Our judgment is that these latter considerations
without more are sufficient justification for rejection of
the strict priority allocation advanced by the United
States and Nebraska. An equitable apportionment may
be had without fashioning a decree of that detail. And
greater administrative flexibility may be achievtd within
the respective States by choice of another alternative.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

The United States and Nebraska, however, press on us
a second alternative in lieu of the 25-75 percentage basis
recommended by the Special Master. They suggest that
a schedule of varying flows of the stream be adopted.
Under that theory there would be an allocation on a priority basis to each of the seven "blocks" of second feet
up to and including 1,526 second feet. All above 1,526 second feet would be apportioned on a percentage basis, e. g.
28 per cent to Wyoming and 72 per cent to Nebraska.
That alternative method has much to recommend it
because of its rather strict adherence to the principle of
priority during the periods of low flow. And it may be
that it would involve no greater administrative burden
than the flat percentage method. For as Nebraska points
out, when the supply is determined it would seem to be
as easy to give Wyoming the first 103 second feet and
Nebraska the next 924 second feet as it would be to divide
the second feet of flow by percentages. Moreover, the
proposed alternative method would preserve, as well as the
flat percentage method, the full control of each State over
1
the internal administration of her water supply.
We are not satisfied, however, that the block system of
allocation up to and including 1,526 second feet is the more
equitable under the circumstances of this case. The combined requirement of the Tri-State and Mitchell Canals is
924 second feet. Under the block system of apportionment there would be no water for the Wyoming canals in
groups 3, 5, and 7 of the foregoing table except such storage water as would be available to the Lingle and Hill Districts in group 5 under their Warren Act contracts. The
Wyoming appropriations in these groups are, to be sure,
junior to Tri-State and Mitchell. But as the Special Master points out those Wyoming appropriations, though junior, represent old established uses in existence from 40 to
over 50 years. Their water supply was not challenged by
Nebraska on behalf of Tri-State and Mitchell until the
1931-1940 drought cycle. For example, 6,282 acres are

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.

served by two canals which have exercised their appropriative rights without interference for over 50 years. Furthermore, the great increase in return flows from the
North Platte Project, which we discussed earlier, are relevant here. Those return flows are a "windfall" to irrigators who are so situated on the river as to use them yet who
do not have storage rights and who share no part of storage costs. As we have seen, these return flows are substantial and should be taken into account in balancing
the equities between Wyoming and Nebraska in this section of the river. Moreover, the storage water rights of the
lands included in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the foregoing
table bear upon this problem. Eighty-two per cent of that
Nebraska acreage has storage water rights under Warren
Act contracts; 7 per cent of that Wyoming acreage has
storage watei rights. When groups 1 to 7 are considered,
82 per cent of the Nebraska acreage and 47 per cent of
the Wyoming acreage have storage water rights under
Warren Act contracts. The Mitchell and Ramshorn Canals are the only Nebraska canals in the 7 groups which
have no storage water rights. As we have said, storage
water, though not apportioned, may be taken into account
in determining each State's equitable share of the natural
flow. Wyoming v. Colorado, supra. Our problem is not
to determine what allocation would be equitable among
the canals in Nebraska or among those in Wyoming. That
is a problem of internal administration for each of the
States. Our problem involves only an appraisal of the
equities between the claimants whom Wyoming represents on the one hand and those represented by Nebraska
on the other. We conclude that the early Wyoming uses,
the return flows, and the greater storage water rights
which Nebraska appropriators have in this section as
compared with those of Wyoming appropriators tip the
scales in favor of the flat percentage system recommended
by the Special Master. It should be noted, moreover, that
that method of apportionment, though not strictly adher-

ing to the principle of priority, gives it great weight and
does not cause as great a distortion as might appear to be
the case. For on the first 412 second feet of flow the advantage would be with Nebraska, since 412 is the point at
which 25 per cent of the flow would first equal the 103
second feet which on a priority basis would go to Wyoming. On the next 1,114 second feet the advantage would
be with Wyoming, since Wyoming's share on a priority
basis would equal 25 per cent of the flow only after the
total flow had reached 1,526 second feet.
Accordingly, we conclude that the flat p~rcentage
method recommended by the Special Master is the most
equitable method of apportionment. We have considered
the arguments advanced against the apportionment being
made on the basis of 25-75 per cent.- But we do not believe
the evidence warrants a change in those percentages.
Wyoming urges reductions in'the requirements for the
Whalen to Tri-State Dam section of the river. As we
have seen, the seasonal requirement, as found by the Special Master, is 1,027,000 acre feet. Wyoming thinks this
should be reduced 85,000 acre feet by lowering the estimates for the Interstate, Tri-State and Northport Canals and by eliminating the demand of Ramshorn. Wyoming would reduce Interstate by 60,000 acre feet-15,000
on account of alleged excessive acreage, 27,000 on account
of possible large winter diversions to Lake Minatare and
Lake Alice, 18,000 on account of water which can be
pumped from wells. We have examined the evidence on
the alleged excessive acreage and the Lake Minatare and
Lake Alice diversions and are satisfied that Wyoming has
not made a showing sufficient to sustain her exceptions.
It would serve no useful purpose to burden this opinion
with the details. As respects the desired reduction because of pumping little need be said. In 1940 Interstate
received only 45 per cent of its requirements. Wyoming
estimates that the water pumped during that year was the
equivalent of 18,000 acre feet at the headgate. It is diffi-

cult to see the equity in Wyoming's demand that Interstate's quota from the river be reduced by that amount,
These irrigators bore their share of the cost of the operas
tion and maintenance of Pathfinder and Guernsey n d
also paid the cost of the pumping. It is not just that they
forego the benefits of the water for which they are paying,
give the benefits to others, and take on the additional expense of pumping.
We have carefully considered Wyoming's claim that
excessive estimates have been allowed Tri-State and
Northport. As respects Tri-State there is a sharp conflict
over the evidence concerning the acreage served. While
the acreage of 52,300 acres computed by the Special Master is liberal, it has support in the evidence and Wyoming
has not made a sufficient showing which warrants a reduction from that figure. It is true that the Tri-State acreage expanded as the result of Warren Act contracts and
that a demand on natural flow to supply that aggregate
acreage on its face seems inequitable in relation to canals
junior to Tri-State which have no storage rights. But
the Special Master found that the supply for the Wyomin k private canals in this section had also been enhanced through the operation of Pathfinder and return
flows resulting from the use of storage water. We do not
believe sufficient disparity has been shown to warrant an
adjustment in the decree. The Special Master allowed^80
per cent for loss in the Tri-State Canal. Wyoming.claims
that should be reduced because water intercepted in the
Tri-State Canal for delivery to Northport does not suffer
as great a loss since it is not carried as far. But Wyoming's witness reached the same view as the Special Master. And no proof is advanced by Wyoming which undermines that conclusion. Moreover, an examination of the
points at which the return flows are intercepted indicates
that the room for difference of opinion is not as great as
Wyoming suggests.

648

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
325 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Wyoming's contention that in determining the requirements of the canals in this section Ramshorn should not
have been allotted 3,000 acre feet per annum presents
different problems. Ramshorn receives its supply through
Tri-State. The Special Master in computing the requirements of Tri-State deducted the return flows below the
Tri-State Dam which were intercepted and utilized by
the canal.2 But there Apparently was not deducted the
accretions from Spring Creek, a tributary which flows into
the river below the Wyoming-Nebraska line and above
Tri-State Dam.21 The average run-off of Spring Creek
from May to September during the 1932-1940 period appears to have been 2,855 acre feet. We agree that this
accretion should be taken into account in computing
Nebraska's requirement of water from Wyoming.
The Special Master found that the priorities of the
canals in this section, the acres served, the requirements
iri second feet (one second foot for each 70 acres), and the
acre feet requirement per season were as follows:

650

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Nebraska contends that the requirements of Tri-State
should be 196,000 acre feet and that the allotment to the
Gering-Ft. Laramie Irrigation District should be 169,165
acre feet. The argument for the increase for Tri-State is
based on the theory that Nebraska has not been given in
this section the same margin of safety which was allowed
Wyoming in the Pathfinder-Whalen section of the river.
But Nebraska has not shown that this allowance was less
accurate than the ones made to Wyoming in the other
isection of the river. And our reading of the record conIvinces us that the allowances to Nebraska are as liberal as
those to Wyoming and that an increase to either would
not be justified in view of the overappropriation of the
natural flow. The argument of an increase in the allotment to the Gering-Ft. Laramie Irrigation District points
out ,that it receives the same headgate allotment as the
"'Goshen Irriqation District in Wyoming which supplies the
Wyoming land under this canal and that the lower area
should be given a substantially, larger headgate allotment
to compensate for canal losses in the upper section of the
canal. This arguxnent, 4owever, is not supported by evidence. The same allowance for the lands in each/State is
supporte4 by the record. For there is evidence that the
delivery to the lands in, each State in relation to headgate
diversions is substantially the saree.
The United States contends that the ,allowa 'ce of 65
second feet for 'the Northport Canal is error.r As the
!Special Master indicated, the 65 second feet allowance is
the amount necessary to serve th acreago under that canal
which wVill not' be served by return flow intercepted and
transported for Northport by the Tri-State Canal. But
as the United States points out, return flow is ,not steady
during, the irrigation season. It presented a study showing that in the,seven best years from 1930 to 1940 the average return flow intercepted by Tri-State on May 1 was
only 23 second feet, averaged only 43.9 second feet for the

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

month of May, averaged 135 gecond feet for the month of
July and did not reach its peak of 200 second feet until
September 30, the end of the irrigation season. On that
basis Northport could irrigate very little of its acreage
from return flow in the first part of the irrigation season,
though at the end of the season it could irrigate all. The
second feet requirement of Northport is 186. We conclude
that Northport should be entitled to use that amount of
flow during the season to meet its requirement of 19,100
acre feet. The 186 second feet will, however, be subject to
reduction by the amount of return flow intercepted by the
Tri-State Canal for delivery to Northport at any given
ppint of time.
As we have noted,' the Special Master recommends

that for this part of the decree segregation of natural flow
and storage water be determined in accordance with the
formula and data appearing in U. S. Exhibit 204A, unless
and until Nebraska, Wyoming and the United States agree
upon a modification or upon another formula. Wyoming
contends that it is impossible to determine what is natural
flow and what is storage water in the Whalen-Tri-State
Dam section of the river from day to day. The problem
is a perplexing one. Physical segregation is, of course,
impossible. But on the basis of the record we think that
it is feasible to determine what portion of the flow at a
given point is storage water and what portion is natura
flow. Precision is concededly impossible. But approximations are possible; and they are sufficient for t*e- administration of the river under .the decree. It is true, as
Wyoming says, that in order to segregate storage water
and natural flow, losses by evaporation must be determined and, since those losses vary from section to section,
the number of days required for the water to travel from
one point to another must be known. The time required
for water to travel from Alcova to Nebraska varies under
different conditions. As an expert of the Bureau of
22 Note 19, supra.

652

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Reclamation testified, since that time interval varies
with the amount of water flowing in the river, it is difficult
to make a formula which reflects it. Indeed U. S. Exhibit
204A does not include the time lag element and therefore
does not supply all the data necessary in the segregation
of natural flow and storage water at Whalen. But this
expert testified that although it had not been possible to
reflect the time interval in a formula, an adjustment for it
was made:
"Q.-In making this time interval correction, you
use your best judgment, based upon your experience
on the river and your observation of what conditions
were in the river, and, using that judgment, you
arrive at the figure for this time interval correction,
do you not?
"A.-Yes, it is a more or less arbitrary correction
But while the adjustment is an arbitrary one, corrections can be made and are made so that over a short
period of days the segregation is balanced.2 And the
23 This expert for the Bureau of Reclamation, C. F. Gleason,
-testified:
"Q.-If there is. an error in a series of four or five days as to the
amount of natural flow in relation to the storage, that might mean
that a natural flow canal might get more or might get less than its
due allotment of water, isn't that right?
"A.-That might be true over a very short period. However, the
corrections made which are shown in the work sheets as plus or minus
storage in that section of the river are made to balance out in such a
way that over the season there is no robbery of natural flow or storage
and no particular accrual to it as a result of this method of calculation.
"Q.-That is, an attempt is made to balance out, according to your
judgment of what ought to be the amount of natural flow and storage
at the State line, is that right?
"A.-It is not balanced out according to judgment. It is balanced
out mathematically.
"Q.-But it is balanced out mathematically upon what factors?
"A.-Upon the factors of plus and minus channel storage, if you
want to use that term. If we plus storage into the channel some days,

Opinion of the Court.

evidence is that though this adjustment is only approximate and lacks precision, it is sufficiently accurate for
administrative purposes. For this expert of the Bureau
of Reclamation testified:
"Q.-But, giving consideration to all of these factors, there isn't any way of making any accurate
determination, day to day, of the actual balance of
natural flow and storage at either Guernsey or the
Nebraska-Wyoming line, is there?
"A.-That term 'accurate' depends upon what is
accurate.
'Q.-I mean this, Mr. Gleason-if there is 5,000
second feet of water arriving at Guernsey, is there any
way that you can correctly and accurately determine
that 2,500, for instance, is storage and that 2,500 is
natural flow?
"A.-Oh, I believe that we arrive at a figure that is
correct enough for administrative purposes. It must
be realized that an error of ten second feet in five
hundred 'is inevitable. All hydrographic records are
inaccurate to a varying extent, and the computations
based upon them, and based upon assumptions as to
evaporation in preparing formulae, so the judgment
of the men doing it enters into the final figure, and
the most we can hope to do is to arrive at daily figures
which, summed up over a period of time, will more
we minus the total of the same amount later on to make it balance

out.
"Q.-That is to say, and you just testified in that way, that your
balancing out of these plus and minus quantities that you put in is
based upon your judgment of how much natural flow and storage water
is at the State line, in view of the conditions and the quantities of
natural flow and storage at Alcova?
"A.-Yes, that is correct.
"Q.-Accordingly, the plus or minus corrections are based upon
this matter of judgment.
"A.-Yes."

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.

325 U. S.

closely approximate the accurate figures than the
daily figures taken individually do."
No other expert testimony undermines that conclusion.
We cannot conclude that the segregation of natural
flow and storage water lacks feasibility. If a comprehensive formula can be agreed upon, it may later be
incorporated in the decree.
Gauging Stations and MeasuringDevices. The Special
Master recommends that such additional gauging stations
and measuring devices at or near the Wyoming-Nebraska
state line be installed as are necessary for effecting the
apportionment in the Whalen-Tri-State Dam section of
the river and that they be constructed and maintained at
the joint and equal expense of Nebraska and Wyoming.
The parties take no exception to this recommendation
and it will be adopted.
Tri-State Dam to Bridgeport, Neb. The Special Master excluded this section of the river from the apportionment on the grounds that its canals are adequately supplied from return flows and other local sources. Nebraska
'takes exception to that exclusion. She points out that of
the 12 canals in this section which bear on our problem,
two have Warren Act contracts. Nine are senior to all
Wyoming appropriations except the first 103 second feet
for the oldest appropriators; only about 200 second feet
of Wyoming appropriations are senior to these Nebraska
appropriations. Nebraska says that four of these canals
had insufficient supplies during the three dry years of
1934, 1936 and 1940. And she points out that during the
same periods the nine Wyoming canals, serving substantially the same kinds of areas, had excessive diversions.
But it appears that other Nebraska canals in the section
had excessive diversions during the same years. And the
record supports the conclusion of the Special Master that
seasonal supplies are adequate. He explained the shortages as due (1) to lack of coincidence between the time

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Opinion of the Court.

and quantity of supplies and the time and extent of needs;
(2) the excessive diversions by some canals at the expense
of others; (3) the withdrawal of water as a matter of
priority to supply senior canals in the lower section. The
latter he thought would be largely eliminated due to the
construction of the Kingsley and Sutherland Reservoirs.
Nebraska has not convinced us that there is error in
this conclusion. Two of the canals have Warren Act contracts. In the 1931-1940 period while there was no limitation on Wyoming uses for Nebraska's benefit, the mean
divertible flow passing Tri-State Dam for the May:
September period was 81,700 acre feet. This is in addition
to the local supplies which even during the drought period
were adequate to meet the needs of the canals without
calling upon up-river water.
This section will accordingly not be included in the
apportionment.
Modificationof the Decree. The Special Master recommends that the decree permit any of the parties to apply
at the foot of the decree for its amendment or for further
relief, and that the Court retain jurisdiction of the suit
for the purpose of any order, direction, or modification of
the decree or any supplementary decree that may at any
time be deemed proper in relation to the subject matter
in controversy. Colorado and Wyoming object to this
provision. Colorado's objection that this provision places
administrative burdens on the Court which we should not
assume has been sufficiently answered. Wyoming's objection is in the main that a complete equitable apportionment should be made, leaving open for future consid'
eration only the question of additional development above
Whalen in Wyoming and Colorado. But our rejection
of the proposal for a mass allocation disposes of this objection. And we do not think it appropriate to bar, as
Wyoming suggests, applications fof modifications within a
period of ten years, or alternately five years, from entry
of the decree.

656

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Ordinaryand Usual Domestic and Municipal Purposes.
The Special Master reports that the parties are agreed
that there should be no restriction upon the diversion from
the North Platte River in Colorado or Wyoming of water
for ordinary and usual domestic and municipal purposes
and consumption and that nothing in the recommended
decree is intended to or will interfere with such diversions and uses. Wyoming suggests that that provision
cover not only diversions from the North Platte River
in Colorado and Wyoming but also diversion from its tributaries in those States and that stock-watering purposes
be excepted as well as ordinary and usual domestic and
municipal purposes. We think those suggestions are appropriate ones. They will be adopted.
Records of Irrigationand Storage. The decree, as has
been seen, will limit Wyoming and Colorado to the irrigation of stated acreages above Pathfinder and to storage of
more than stated amounts of water in that region. The
United States insists that the decree should also require
Wyoming and Colorado to maintain complete and accurate records of irrigation and storage of water in those
areas and to keep them available. Wyoming says that is
an unnecessary provision. Colorado says that its officials
already have such duties. But the record in this case reflects the need for complete and accurate records. And it
seems to us desirable that such records be kept. Otherwise, neither the States nor the other interested parties
can know if the acreage and storage limitations are being
met. Continuous records will simplify the program of
administration. The proposal is adopted.
Importation of Water. The decree which we enter apportions only the natural flow of the North Platte River.
The United States suggests that the decree explicitly state
that it does not cover any additional supply of water which
may be imported into this basin from the watershed of
an entirely separate stream and which presently does not

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

ROBERTS,

J., dissenting.

flow into the basin. To remove any possible doubt on
that score the decree will contain a provision that it does
not and will not affect the use of such additional supplies
of water or the return flow from it. All questions concerning the apportionment of such water will await the event.
The parties may within ninety days submit the form of
decree to carry this opinion into effect. Costs will be
apportioned and paid as follows: The State of Colorado,
one-fifth; the State of Wyoming, two-fifths; and the State
of Nebraska, two-fifths.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS.

I am unable to agree with the court's disposition of this
case. I think the decision constitutes a departure from
principles long established and observed by the court in
litigations between the states of the Union, and adopts a
course diametrically opposed to our most recent adjudication in the field of interstate waters." Without proof of
actual damage in the past, or of any threat of substantial
damage in the near future, the court now undertakes to
assume jurisdiction over three quasi-sovereign states and
to supervise, for all time, their respective uses of an interstate stream on the basis of past use, including, over a
ten-year term, the greatest drought in the history of the
region, admitting, in effect, that its allocation of privileges
to the respective states will have to be revised and modified
when that drought ceases and more water becomes available for beneficial use. I doubt if, in such interstate controversies, any state is ever entitled to a declaratory judg*ment from this court. I am sure that, on the showing in
the present record, none of the states is entitled to a dec'Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S. 383.

laration of rights. The precedent now made will arise to
plague this court not only in the present suit but in others.
The future will demonstrate, in my judgment, how wrong
it is for this court to attempt to become a continuing umpire or a standing Master to whom the parties must go
at intervals for leave to do what, in their sovereign right,
they should be able to do without let or hindrance, provided only that they work no substantial damage to their
neighbors. In such controversies the judicial power
should be firmly exercised upon proper occasion, but as
firmly withheld unless the circumstances plainly demand
the intervention of the court. Such mutual accommodations for the future as Nebraska and Wyoming desire
should be arranged by interstate compact, not by
litigation.
Nebraska initiated this suit on the theory that Wyoming was diverting water under Wyoming appropriations
junior to Nebraska appropriations, which, at the time,
were either receiving no water or an insufficient supply.
NebrAska, in support of its position, attempted to prove
the worth of an acre-foot of water for irrigation. But, of
course, this is not the way to prove damage in such a controversy; water for beneficial use is what counts. No
injury results from the deprivation of water unless a need
is shown for that water for beneficial consumptive use at
the time by the State claiming to have been wrongfully
deprived of it. If water is not needed by downstream
senior rights, the denial of water to upstream junior rights
can result only in waste. No State may play dog in the
manger, and build up reserves for future use in the absence of present need and present damage.
Even on Nebraska's theory, she did not see fit to implead Colorado, obviously because she despaired of showing that anything Colorado was doing, or threatening
presently to do, deprived her of any right. Wyoming impleaded Colorado not on the theory that Colorado was

RoBERTS,

J., dissenting.

injuring Wyoming, or threatening so to do, but on the
theory that there ought to be an apportionment of
"rights" in the waters of ithe stream as between the three
States,-an. advisory judgment on the subject.
I shall first discuss the contemplated decree as it affects
Colorado. The Master finds:
"Equity does not require any restriction upon or interference with present uses of water by Colorado within the
North Platte Basin in North Park or any reduction in the
present rate of transbasin exportation from North Park.
"Furthermore, reduction in Colorado use would not correspondingly enhance the supply of the other States. In
fact there is no clear showing as to the extent of benefit
to the North Platte Project or other Wyoming or Nebraska
users of any limitation upon present uses in North
Park."
The Master concludes:
"From a consideration of all the factors bearing on those
equities, my judgment is that equitable apportionment
does not require any interference with present uses in
North Park."
After referring to possible schemes for further use of
water in Colorado as constituting a threat of further depletion, he says of the threat: "It can hardly be said to be
immediate." He sums up his conclusions as to Colorado
as follows:
"A prohibition against further expansion of irrigation
in North Park seems to me recommended by consideration
of (a) the insufficiency of the present supply at best to
more than satisfy the requirements of presently established uses, (b) the principle laid down in Wyoming v.
Colorado, (c) the consonance of such limitation with
the general -plan of apportionment being recommended
herein. At the same time to impose a permanently fixed
restriction against further irrigation development in North
Park would not appear justified in view of the possibility
of such future increase, in supply as to rdnder it unneces-

sary. The three alternatives are (1) an outright dismissal as to Colorado, (2) denial of any present relief
against that state with retention of jurisdiction to grant
such relief on a later showing of such continuation of
present conditions of supply as to require the conclusion
that they must be accepted as the measure of dependability, (3) imposition of a limitation to present uses of
water with retention of jurisdiction to release the restriction if and when the 'dry cycle' shall run its course and it
appears that the water supply has become such as to
justify further expansion of irrigation in North Park.
A reasonableargument can be made for any of these three
alternatives. My recommendation in line with the third
alternative is that Colorado be limited to the irrigation
of 135,000 acres, to the accumulation annually of 17,000
acre feet of storage water, and the exportation of 6,000
acre feet per annum to the South Platte basin."
In the proposed decree, he would enjoin Colorado in
accordance with this recommendation although, confessedly, Colorado is not diverting or contemplating diversion
of the waters in question. A more gratuitous interference
with a quasi-sovereign State I cannot imagine. It would
disregard all that we have repeatedly said to the effect
Jhat- a State should not be enjoined by this court at the
tuift'o a sister State unless she is inflicting, or threatening
immediately to inflict, grave and substantial damage upon
the complainant. I cannot imagine that, as between
private parties, an injunction would go against one who
is not doing, or immediately threatening to do, harm to
the complainant. The court is simply taking Colorado
under its wing and proposes to act as guardian of the State
in respect to the waters of the North Platte within her
borders.
One need only examine the Master's report to determine that Nebraska's case against Wyoming stands no
better than that against Colorado.
This court stated, in Coloradov. Kansas, 320 U. S. 383,
393: "Such a controversy as is here presented is not to
be determined as if it were one between two private

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

ROBERTS, J., dissenting.

riparian proprietors or appropriators." Nor is it to be
determined by the relative priorities of the users in the
upper and the lower States. Yet that is what in effect
Nebraska sought by her complaint. She is n t awarded
the relief she asked but instead the so-called "natural
flow" water is apportioned" in percentages between Wyoming and Nebraska. This is done in spite of the fact
that the Master finds that Nebraska needs none of the
natural flow which passes the Tri-State Dam for lands
lying below that point but has ample water for those lands,
regardless of any such flow. Without a showing of need
for water for beneficial use and, in spite of the fact that
some of the water flowing past the Tri-State Dam is
found now to go to waste, an apportionment is made between Wyoming and Nebraska. The Master's findings
show that, under the heretofore uniform test, Nebraska
has not proved such damage as would entitle her now to
relief. The table quoted in footnote 4 of the court's opinion demonstrates that during a thirty-year period, While
irrigation did not increase materially in Colorado and increased about one-third in Wyoming, Nebraska more than
doubled her acreages under irrigation. Speaking of Nebraska agriculture's dependence on irrigation, the Master
says:
"On the other hand, when scanned for evidence of
serious drouth damage since 1931, the statistics are
equivocal. It appears that there was a rather sharp reduction in the production of alfalfa and sugar beets, but
the indication is that this was due to a reduction of acreage rather than of rate of yield. While there was some
decline in the production rate of alfalfa, there was a rise
in the rate for sugar beets. The acreages devoted to beans
and potatoes increased to very closely offset-the reduction
in beets and alfalfa, the total acreages devoted tothe four
crops for the three five-year periods,- being 124,281,
122,332, and 122,130 respectively. The large increase in
total production of beans and potatoes should also be
noted. The statistics, taken all in all, are, to say the least,

662

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
ROBERTS, J., dissenting.

325 U.

S.

inconclusive as to the existence or extent of damage to
Nebraska by reason of the drouth or by reason of any
deprivation of water by wrongful uses in Wyoming or
Colorado.
"Nebraska makes no strong claim for its showing in this
regard. Her brief says:
' . . . the factors involved in the crop statistics which cannot be eliminated largely distort the picture and make it
difficult to show one way or the other the effect and results
of the shortage of irrigation water upon crop production.
However, we believe that when the statistics are properly
considered in the light of other factors, they indicate that
crop production is seriously damaged when the water
supply is low.'
"Another apparent demonstration of the importance of
the part played by irrigation in the economic development
of western Nebraska may be seen in its Exhibits 433 and
434, in which the growth of population in eight counties
in which irrigation has been practiced is compared with
that of six counties without irrigation, the latter lying
immediately east and south of the irrigated group. The
first or irrigated group of counties shows an increase in
population in the 40-year period between 1890 and 1930
of 131 per cent. The second, the nonirrigated group, for
the same period shows a population loss of three pejr cent.
No attempt, however,, is made to attribute this lack of
growth in the second group to anything done in Wyoming
or Colorado."
Again the Master says:
"It is of course obvious in general and without any detailed proof that in an arid or semi-arid country deprivation of water for irrigation in time of need cannot be
otherwise than injurious to the area deprived. The.weakness, if such there be, in Nebraska's proof is uncertainty
as to the extent of any invasion of her equitable share except as measured by diversions 'out of priority' and uncertainty as to the extent of her injury consequent upon
the alleged violation of her equitable rights, except as
measured by the dollar value 'assigned to the water lost
to her through such diversions. If to sustain her burden
of proof Nebraska must establish not only violations of

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

ROBERTS,

663

J., dissenting.

her priorities or infringement otherwise on her equitable

share by the other States, but also that as a result she
has suffered injury of great magnitude in the broad sense
of serious damage to her agriculture or industries or observable adverse effects upon her general economy, prosperity or population, then her proof has failed, for there is
no clear evidence of any of these things." (Italics in Master's report.)
Further the Master finds:
"Another factor favoring Nebraska is that there will
commonly be accidental water in substantial quantities
passing the state line above that allocated to the State.
Even during the dry cycle and with no restriction on Wyoming uses, the usable water passing Tri-State Dam averaged in the May-September period 81,700 acre feet. More
than half of this flow, however, occurred in May and June
with comparatively little in August and September. The
quantity is perhaps too uncertain to be considered of great
importance. It is a minor factor in the balancing of equities between the States."
Thus it is apparent that of the very natural flow of water
with which the Master is dealing some of it went to waste
in the area he considered critical.. In other words, there
was more water for Nebraska than she turned to beneficial use even in the drought years.
As respects both defendants the decree makes a provisional adjustment based upon drought conditions, with
the understanding that if conditions change, by reason of
events not now envisaged, the defendants may again
come to this court for another provisional arrangement
which shall stand until some party to the decree thinks
that a further revision should be made. Thus three States,
with respect to their quasi-sovereign rights, will be in
tutelage to this court henceforth.

repose. Even when judicial enforcement of rights is required, the attempt finally to adjudicate them often proves
abortive. Our reports afford evidence of this fact. Kan-

sas and Colorado came here twice, at the instance of Kansas, in a dispute over the flow of the Arkansas River.2 In
a case presenting, on the whole, less difficulty than the
present one this court entered a decree June 5, 1922,' only
to find it necessary to revise it on October 9, 1922.' But
the controversy would not down. The parties came back
here on three occasions because of misunderstandings and
disagreements with respect td the effect of our decree.'
The controversy with respect to the diversion of the
waters of Lake Michigan seemed to require a decree conditioned upon, and containing provisions with respect to,
future conduct. The difficulty of administering that decree is evidenced by the repeated appearance of the parties
in this court.6
Experience teaches the wisdom of the rule we have so
often announced, that, in such cases, the complaining State
must show actual or immediately threatened damage of
substantial magnitude to move this court to grant relief;
and that, until such showing is made, the court should
not interfere. The court, as I think, now departs from
this course.
The bill should be dismissed.

DECREE.
(ENTED OcToBR 8, 1945.)
This cause having been heretofore submitted on the
report of the Special Master and the exceptions of the
parties thereto,: and the Court being now fully advised
in the premises:
It is ordered, adjudged and decreed that:
I. The State of Colorado, its officers, attorneys, agents
and employees, be and they are hereby severally enjoined
(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of
water from the North Platte River and its tributaries
for the irrigation of more than a total of 135,000 acres

of land in Jackson County, Colorado, during any one
irrigation season;
(b) From storing or permitting the storage of more
than a total amount of 17,000 acre feet of water for
irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and
its tributaries in Jackson County, Colorado, between
October 1 of any year and September 30 of the following year;
(c) From exporting out of the basin of the North
Platte River and its tributaries in Jackson County,
Colorado, to any other stream basin or basins more
than 60,000 acre feet of water in any period of ten
consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive
series beginning with October 1, 1945.
II. Exclusive of the Kendrick Project and Seminoe
Reservoir the State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys,
agents and employees, be and they are hereby severally
enjoined
(a) From diverting or permitting the diversion of
water from the North Platte River above the Guernsey Reservoir and from the tributaries entering the
North Platte River above the Pathfinder Dam for the

666

Decree.

325 U. S.

irrigation of more than a total of 168,000 acres of land
in Wyoming during any one irrigation season.
(b) From storing or permitting the storage of more
than a total amount of 18,000 acre feet of water for
irrigation purposes from the North Platte River and
its tributaries above the Pathfinder Reservoir between October 1 of any year and September 30 of the
following year.
III. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys,
agents and employees, be and they are hereby severally
enjoined from storing or permitting the storage of water
in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe and Alcova Reservoirs
otherwise than in accordance with the relative storage
rights, as among themselves, of such reservoirs, which are
hereby defined and fixed as follows:
First, Pathfinder Reservoir;
Second, Guernsey Reservoir;
Third, Seminoe Reservoir; and
Fourth, Alcova Reservoir;
Provided, however, that water may be impounded in or
released from Seminoe Reservoir, contrary to the foregoing
rule of priority operation for use in the generation of electric power when and only when such storage or release
will not materially interfere with the' administration of
water for irrigation purposes according to the priority decreed for the French Canal and the State Line Canals.
IV. The State of Wyoming, its officers,' attorneys,
agents and employees be and they are hereby severally
enjoined from storing or permitting the storage of water.
in Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe or Alcova Reservoirs,
and from the diversion of natural flow water through the
Casper Canal for the Kendrick Project between and including May 1 and September 30 of each year otherwise
than in accordance with the rule of priority in relation to
the appropriations of the Nebraska lands supplied by the
French Canal and by the State Line Canals, which said

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Decree.

Nebraska appropriations are hereby adjudged to be senior
to said four reservoirs and said Casper Canal, and which
said Nebraska appropriations are hereby identified and
defined, and their diversion limitations in second feet and
seasonal limitations in acre feet fixed as follows:

V. The natural flow in the Guernsey Dam to Tri-State
Dam section between and including May 1 and September
30 of each year, including the contribution of Spring Creek,
be and the same hereby is apportioned between Wyoming
and Nebraska on the basis of twenty-five per cent to
Wyoming and seventy-five per cent to Nebraska, with the
right granted Nebraska to designate from time to time the
portion of its share which shall be delivered into the Interstate, Fort Laramie, French and Mitchell Canals for use
on the Nebraska lands served by these canals. The State
of Nebraska, its officers, attorneys, agents and employees,
and the State of. Wyoming, its officers, attorneys, agents
and employees, are hereby enjoined and restrained from
diversion or use contrary to this apportionment, provided
that in the apportionment of water in this section the flow
for each day, until ascertainable, shall be assumed to be
the same as that of the preceding day, as shown by the
measurements and computations for that day,-and provided further, that unless and until Nebraska, Wyoming
and the United States agree upon a modification thereof,
or upon another formula, reservoir evaporation and transportation losses in the segregation of natural flow and
storage shall be computed in accordance with the following
formula taken from United States' Exhibit 204A:

668

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Decree.

325 U. S.

Reservoir Evaporation Losses.
Seminoe, Pathfinderand Alcova Reservoirs.
Evaporation will be computed daily based upon
evaporation from Weather Bureau Standard 4 foot
diameter Class "A" pan located at Pathfinder Reservoir. Daily evaporation will be multiplied by area
of water surface of reservoir in acres and by co-efficient
of 70% to reduce pan record to open water surface.
Guernsey Reservoir.
Compute same as above except use pan evaporation
at Whalen Dam.
River CarriageLosses.
River carriage losses will be computed upon basis
of area of river water surface as determined by aerial
surveys made in 1939 and previous years and upon
average monthly evaporation at Pathfinder Reservoir
for the period 1921 to 1939, inclusive, using a coefficient of 70% to reduce pan records to open water
surface.
Daily evaporation losses in second-feet for various
sections of the river are shown in the following table:

Above table is based upon mean evaporation at
Pathfinder as- follows: May .561 ft.; June .767 ft.;
July .910 ft.; Aug. .799 ft.; Sept. .568 ft. Co-efficient
of 70% to reduce pan record to open water surface.
Above table does not contain computed loss for section of river from Pathfinder Dam to head of Alcova
Reservoir (area 170 acres) because this area is less
than submerged area of original river bed in Alcova
Reservoir, and is, therefore, considered as off-set.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Decree.

Likewise the area between Seminoe Dam and head
of Pathfinder Reservoir is less than area of original
river bed through Pathfinder Reservoir--considered
as off-set. Evaporation losses will be divided between
natural flow and storage water flowing in any section
of river channel upon a proportional basis. This
proportion will ordinarily be determined at the upper
end of the section except under conditions of intervening accruals or diversions that materially change
the ratio of storage to natural flow at the lower end of
the section. In such event the average proportion for
the section will be determined by using the mean ratio
for the two ends of the section.
In the determination of transportation losses for the
various sections of the stream, such time intervals for the
passage of water from point to point shall be used as may
be agreed upon by Nebraska, Wyoming and the United
States, or in the absence of such agreement, as may be decided upon from day to day by the manager of the government reservoirs, with such adjustments to be made by
said manager from time to time as may be necessary to
make as accurate a segregation as is possible.
VI. This decree is intended to and does deal with and
apportion only the natural flow of the North Platte River.
Storage water shall not be affected by this decree and the
owners of rights therein shall be permitted to distribute
the same in accordance with any lawful contracts which
they may have entered into or may in the future enter into,
without interference because of this decree.
VII. Such additional gauging stations and measuring
devices at or near the Wyoming-Nebraska state line, if
any, as may be necessary for making any apportionment
herein decreed, shall be constructed and maintained at the
joint and equal expense of Wyoming and Nebraska to the
extent that the costs thereof are not paid by others.
VIII. The State of Wyoming, its officers, attorneys,
agents and employees be and they are hereby severally

670

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Decree.

325 U. S.

enjoined from diverting or permitting the diversion of
water from the North Platte River or its tributaries at or
above Alcova Reservoir in lieu of or in exchange for return
flow water from the Kendrick Project reaching the North
Platte River below Alcova Reservoir.
IX. The State of Wyoming and the State of Colorado
be and they hereby are each required to prepare and maintain complete and accurate records of the total area of
land irrigated and the storage and exportation of the water
of the North Platte River and its tributaries within those
portions of their respective jurisdictions covered by the
provisions of paragraphs I and II hereof, and such records
shall be available for inspection at all reasonable times;
provided, however, that such records shall not be required
in reference to the water uses permitted by paragraph X
hereof.
X. This decree shall not affect or restrict the use or
diversion of water from the North Platte River and its
tributaries in Colorado or Wyoming for ordinary and usual
domestic, municipal and stock watering purposes and
consumption.
XI. For the purposes of this decree:
(a) "Season" or "seasonal" refers to the irrigation
season, May 1 to September 30, inclusive;
(b) The term "storage water" as applied to releases
from reservoirs owned and operated by the United
States is defined as any water which is released from
reservoirs for use on lands under canals having storage
contracts in addition to the water which is discharged
through those reservoirs to meet natural flow uses permitted by this decree;
(c) "Natural flow water" shall be taken as referring
to all water in the stream except storage water.;
(d) Return flows of Kendrick Project shall be deemed
to be "natural flow water" when they have reached the
North Platte River, and subject to the same diversion
and use as any other natural flow in the stream.

NEBRASKA v. WYOMING.
589

Decree.

XII. This decree shall not affect:
(a) The relative rights of water users within any one
of the Stafes who are parties to this suit except as may
be otherwise specifically provided herein;
(b) Such claims as the United States has to storage
water under Wyoming law; nor will the decree in any
way interfere with the ownership and operation by the
United States of the various federal storage and power
plants, works and facilities.
(c) The use or disposition of any additional supply
or supplies of water which in the future may be imported
into the basin of the North Platte River from the water
shed of an entirely separate stream, and which presently
do not enter said basin, or the return flow from any
such supply or supplies.
(d) The apportionment heretofore made% by this
Court between the States of Wyoming and Colorado of
the waters of the Laramie River, a tributary of the
North Platte River;
(e) The apportionment made by the compact between the States of Nebraska and Colorado, apportioning the water of the South Platte River.
XIII. Any of the parties may apply at the foot of this
decree for its amendment or for further relief. The Court
retains jurisdiction of this suit for the purpose of any order,
direction, or modification of the decree, or any supplementary decree, that may at any time be deemed proper
in relation to the subject matter in controversy. Matters
with reference to which further relief may hereafter be
sought shall include, but shall not be limited to, the
following:
(a) The question of the applicability and effect of
the Act of August 9, 1937, 50 Stat. 564, 595-596, upon
the rights of Colorado and its water users when and if
water hereafter is available for storage and use in connection with the Kendrick Project in Wyoming.

672

Decree.

325 U. S.

(b) The question of the effect upon the rights of
upstream areas of the construction or threatened construction in downstream areas of any projects not now
existing or recognized in this decree;
(c) The question of the effect of the construction or
threatened construction of storage capacity not now
existing on tributaries entering the North Platte River
between Pathfinder Reservoir and Guernsey Reservoir;
(d) The question of the right to divert at or above
the headgate of the Casper Canal any water in lieu of,
or in exchange for, any water developed by artificial
drainage to the river of sump areas on the Kendrick
Project;
(e) Any question relating to the joint operation of
Pathfinder, Guernsey, Seminoe and Alcova Reservoirs
whenever changed conditions make such joint operation
possible;
(f) Any change in conditions making modification of
the decree or the granting of further relief necessary'or
appropriate.
XIV. The costs in this cause shall be apportioned and
paid as follows: the State of Colorado orle-fifth; the State
of Wyoming two-fifths; and the State of Nebraska twofifths. Payment of the fees and expenses of the Special
Master has been provided by a previous order of this
Court.
XV. The clerk of this Court shall transmit to the chief
magistrates of the States of Colorado, Wyoming, and
Nebraska, copies of this decree duly authenticated under
the seal of this Court.
