INLAND EMPIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL, LUMBER
& SAWMILL WORKERS UNION, ET AL. v. MILLIS,
INDIVIDUALLY AND AS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS
BOARD, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 613.

Argued February 26, 27, 1945.-Decided June 11, 1945.

1. No showing having been made in this case that the National Labor
Relations Board, in certifying a bargaining representative of employees pursuant to § 9 (c) of the National Labor Relations Act,
acted unlawfully--either by non-compliance with statutory requirements or by denial of constitutional right-it is inappropriate to
determine whether the Act bars judicial review of certification by
an independent suit under § 24 of the Judicial Code. Pp. 699-700.
2. The hearing afforded by the National Labor Relations Board in
this certification proceeding pursuant to § 9 (c) was "appropriate"
within the meaning of that section, whether or not the proceedings
prior to the election ordered by the Board were adequate, zince the
procedure upon rehearing after the election was adequate and
cured any defects which may have existed at earlier stages of the
hearing. P. 708.
3. Rules of the National Labor Relations Board applicable to proceedings under § 9 (c) contemplate further hearings upon reconsideration before the final act of certification. P. 709.
4. Due process does not require a hearing at the initial stage, or at
any particular point, or at more than one point, in an administrative proceeding, but is satisfied if the requisite hearing is held before
the final order becomes effective. P. 710.
144 F. 2d 539, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, 323 U. S.

325 U. S.

703, to review the reversal of a

judgment refusing to dismiss for want of jurisdiction a
suit against members of the National Labor Relations
Board to set aside a certification of a collective bargaining
representative.
Mr. George E. Flood, with whom Messrs. Joseph A.
Padway and James A. Glenn were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Alvin J. Rockwell, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy, Messrs. Charles F. McErlean, David Findling and

Miss Ruth Weyand were on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE

delivered the opinion of the

Court.

This controversy grows out of a contest between rival
labor unions over the right to act as collective bargaining
representative of employees of Potlatch Forests, Inc., a
company conducting logging, lumbering and milling op-

erations in northern Idaho. Petitioners seek relief from
a certification order of the National Labor Relations Board
issued pursuant to § 9 (c) of the National Labor Relations
Act. 49 Stat. 453; 29 U. S. C. § 159 (c). They are affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, the certified
union with the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
In American Federationof Labor v. Labor Board, 308
U. S. 401, this Court held that a certification under § 9 (c)
is not reviewable by the special statutory procedure except incidentally to review of orders restraining unfair
labor practices under § 10. Decision was expressly reserved whether, apart from such proceedings, review of
certification may be had by an independent suit brought
pursuant to § 24 of the Judicial Code. 308 U. S. 412.
Petitioners now assert the right to such review. Prior
to the certification, they had represented the company's
employees in collective bargaining. They do not seek

review upon the merits of the certification. Their claim
is that they were denied the "appropriate hearing" which
§ 9 (c) requires and that the effect was not only to deprive
them of the statutory right to hearing but also to deny
them due process of law contrary to the Fifth Amendment's guaranty. Accordingly they seek, in substance,
injunctive relief requiring respondents, members of the
Board, to vacate the order of certification or, in the alternative, a declaratory judgment that the order is invalid.
The District Court declined to dismiss the suit, upon
respondents' motion alleging, among other grounds, that
the court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter.
The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, one judge
dissenting. 144 F. 2d 539. That court held that the
statutory review is exclusive, with the consequence that
this suit cannot be maintained. The obvious importance
of the decision caused us to grant the petition for certiorari.' 323 U. S. 703.

certification under § 9 (c) by an independent suit brought
under §24 of the Judicial Code:
"It can be appropriately answered only upon a showing
in such a suit that unlawful action of the Board has inflicted an injury on the petitioners for which the law, apart
from the review provisions of the Wagner Act, affords a
remedy."
Petitioners earnestly urge that this case presents the required showing of unlawful action by the Board and resulting injury. Unless they are right in this view, it
would be inappropriate, as was said in the American Federationof Labor case, to determine the question of reviewability. That question should not be decided in the
absence of some showing that the Board has acted unlawfully. Upon the facts presented, we think no such showing
has been made, whether by way of departure from statutory requirements or from those of due process of law.
On March 9, 1943, local unions affiliated with the C. I. 0.
filed petitions with the Board for certification as bargaining representatives in three of the company's five logging
and milling plants or units. The plants were geographically separate. Some were located as far from others as
one hundred miles. But there was common ownership,
management and control, with occasional shifting of crews
or men from one plant to another.2 Although the petitions sought separate local units rather than a single company-wide unit, the Board consolidated them for hearing
before a trial examiner.
The hearing washeld in May, 1943. The company, the
C.I. 0., and the petitioners, who may be referred to collectively as the A. F. of L.,8 appeared and participated.
2

Some special operations, e. g., the Washington-Idaho-Montana
Railroad, were conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries.
S The collective designation is approximate both for convenience
and by reason of the facts, noted in the text, relating to A. F. of L.'s
dealings with the company through both a "master contract" and
local supplemental agreements.

INLAND EMPIRE COUNCIL v. MILLIS.
697

701

Opinion of the Court.

No complaint is made concerning this hearing. It was
apparently a typical representation proceeding. The
principal issue was the character of the appropriate unit.
The A. F. of L. urged that the unit should be companywide. The C. I. 0. advocated separate plant units.
The Board's decision was rendered July 13, 1943. 51
N. L. R. B. 288. It found that the A. F. of L. had organized the employees on a company-wide basis and 'on
this basis had made a "master contract" with the company,
which, however, was supplemented by local contracts relating to local matters in each of the five operations. The
Board concluded that the history of the bargaining relations had demonstrated the appropriateness of a unit consisting of all the logging and mill employees of the company. It therefore dismissed the petitions of the C. I. 0.
on the ground that the three separate plant units sought
were inappropriate.
Three days later, on July 16, the C. I. 0. filed a further
petition, this time asking to be certified as bargaining representative on a company-wide basis, excluding clerical,
supervisory, confidential, and temporary employees, as
well as employees of Potlatch Townsite and Potlatch Mercantile Company.' The unit thus suggested conformed
generally to the one covered by the outstanding A. F. of L.
contract.
On September 14, pursuant to C. I. O.'s motion, the
Board served notice upon the A. F. of L. to show cause
why the decision of July 13 should not be vacated; the
petitions in the earlier cases reinstated and treated as
amended by the new petition; and why the Board should
not reconsider and proceed to decision without further
hearing. The order also proposed to make part of the

record the statement of the Board's field examiner concerning the C. I. 0. claims of authorization to represent
employees 6
The A. F. of L. responded by filing a "Protest and Objection." This alleged that the proposed order contemplated
a decision without the taking of evidence, to be based in
part on an ex parte survey of the C. I. 0. claims of authorization by employees; that employees of the two units
not involved in the first proceeding would have no opportunity to present evidence in their own behalf;' and
that the Board had no authority to set aside the A. F.
of L.'s existing contract by such proceedings.
The Board considered the objections, but found them
insufficient, rejected the protest and, without further hearing for the taking of evidence, considered the case upon the
full record, including that made in the original hearings.
It again approved a company-wide unit, following the historical lines of organization, but excluded certain "fringe"
classifications in conformity with generally established
policy. It further found that a question concerning representation had arisen and directed that an election be
held among the employees in the appropriate unit as it
had been determined. The Board's decision was rendered
October 14, 1943. 52 N. L. R. B. 1377.
The election was held during the following November
and resulted in a majority for the C. I. 0.' The A. F. of L.
filed "Objections and Exceptions to Election," see 55
The field examiner's report is introduced, not as proof of the
extent of representation by the petitioning union, but .to satisfy the
Board that there is a substantial membership among the employees
in the unit claimed to be appropriate sufficient to justify the Board's
investigatioiL
6These were the plants located at Potlatch and
Coeur d'Alene,
which were not included in the units sought by the C. I. 0. in its

original petitions.

of employees eligible to vote.

N. L. R. B. 255, 256, which renewed the claim of impropriety in failing to hold another hearing and also challenged some exclusions of employees from eligibility to
take part in the election. Accordingly the A. F. of L.
moved to vacate the decision and direction of election, to
vacate the election itself, to stay certification and to grant
an appropriate hearing.
In January, 1944, the Board granted the A. F. of L.'s
motion for further hearing, but deferred ruling upon the
request to vacate the previous decision and the election.
The hearing was held before a trial examiner in February,
1944. Petitioners appeared and participated fully, as did
the company and tile C. I. 0. No complaint is made
concerning the scope of this hearing or the manner in
which it was conducted, except as to its timing in relation
to the election. Full opportunity was afforded petitioners to present objections And evidence in support of
them. From the absence of contrary allegation, as well
as the official report of the Board's decision, it must be
taken that all available objections to the Board's procedure and action were made, considered, and determined
adversely to petitioners."
The Board rendered its supplemental decision on March
4, 1944. 55 N. L. R. B. 255. This made supplemental
findings of fact based upon the entire record, including the
record in the original proceedings, the election report, petitioners' objections and exceptions, the motion for reconsideration, and the evidence and objections taken at the
February hearing. After reviewing the entire proceedings, the Board-found that an "appropriate hearing" had
been given, within the requirement of § 9 (c); ruled upon
each of petitioners' objections, whether new or renewed;
and concluded that none of them furnished adequate reason for disturbing its previous decision and direction for
election. Accordingly it denied the motion to vacate that

decision and the election, and certified the C. I. 0. as exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in the
unit found appropriate. A. F. of L.'s further motion for
reconsideration was denied and thereafter the present suit
was instituted.' Upon this history petitioners say they have been denied
the "appropriate hearing" § 9 (c) requires. They insist
that the hearing, to be "appropriate," must precede the
election. Accordingly the February, 1944, hearing is said
to be inadequate to satisfy the statutory requirement, as
well as due process, although no complaint is made
concerning its adequacy in any respect other than that it
followed, rather than preceded, the election.
Petitioners urge also that the procedure was unwarranted for the Board to vacate the decision of July, 1943,
reopen or "reinstate" the original proceedings, treat the
C. I. O.'s petition for company-wide certification as an
amendment to its original petitions, and thereafter to regard the record in the earlier proceedings as part of the
record in the later ones, together with the field examiner's
report concerning C. I. 0. employee representation.
Petitioners' exact contention concerning the reopening
of the original proceedings is not altogether clear." But,
9 The suit is the last in a series intended to prevent the holding of
the eledtion or to avoid certification founded upon it. See Inland
Empire District Council v. Graham, 53 F. Supp. 369 (W. D. Wash.);
Local 2766, Lumber & Sawmill Workers Union v. Hanson, Civil Action No. 1553 (D. Idaho), unreported; Inland Empire District Council v. Graham, Civil Action No. 834 (W. D. Wash.), unreported;

22353 (D. D. C.), unreported.
10 The argument appears to regard them as irrevocably closed by
the decision of July 13, 1943, and that decision as endowed with
finality precluding the Board from later reopening the proceedings
and considering further the record made in them. It seems also to
suggest that the original petitions could not be amended, at any rate
by treating the later petition as an amendment, after the decision,
notwithstanding 'an order vacating it.

INLAND EMPIRE COUNCIL v. MILLIS.
697

Opinion of the Court.

in any event, it clearly maintains that the Board's action,
in effect treating the later proceedings as a continuance
of the earlier ones, injected new issues upon which petitioners were entitled to present additional evidence. Accordingly it is claimed that the original record, together
with the additional matter presented by the new petition,
the motions which followed, and the proceeding to show
cause, was not adequate to sustain the Board's action in
vacating its first decision and entering the direction for
election. Although petitioners urge that the preelection
proceedings were defective, they emphasize. most strongly
that the February hearing could not cure the failure to
grant the further hearing they demanded prior to the
election.
The Board's position is, in effect, twofold: that there
was no departure from the statute's requirements or those
of due process in the proceedings prior to the election; '
n The Board says that the two proceedings involved the same substantial controversy, namely, representation of the Potlatch Company's employees; and therefore the material issues were the same
except that in the later proceedings the C. I. 0. acceded to the decision that a company-wide unit was appropriate and sought representation on that basis. Only a waste of time and money for all
concerned would have resulted, in the Board's view, from retracing
the ground covered in the earlier hearings. Accordingly, it was entirely proper to treat the later ones as in substance a continuation
of them and to proceed with the determination of the other questions
relating to representation which the narrow ground, of the first
decision had made unnecessary to decide.
The Board also maintains that a further hearing was not required
in the absence of a showing by petitioners that new issues were presented which required the taking of additional evidence. 'In its view
the procedure to show cause afforded adequate opportunity for petitioners to do this and none of the issues they presented furnished
adequate basis either to require holding a further hearing or for refusing to proceed with the election upon the basis proposed.
Lrhe Bard and the petitioners are at odds therefore concerning the
materiality of the issues presented on the show cause procedure and
their sufficiency to require further hearing for the presentation of evi-

325 U. S.

and, if they were defective in any respect, the departure
was cured by the full hearing granted at petitioners'
insistence after the election.
We think petitioners have misconceived the effects of
§ 9 (c). It is as follows:
"Whenever a question affecting commerce arises concerning the representation of employees, the Board may
investigate such controversy and certify to the parties, in
writing, the name or names of the representatives that
have been designated or selected. In any such investiga,tion, the Board shall provide for an appropriatehearing
upon due notice, either in conjunction with a proceeding
under section lOor otherwise, and may take a secret ballot
of employees, or utilize any other suitable method to ascertain such representatives." (Emphasis added.)
The section is short. Its terms are broad and general.
Its only requirements concerning the hearing are three. It
must be "upon due notice," it must be "appropriate," and
it is mandatory "in any such investigation," but may be
held in conjunction with a § 10 (unfair practice) proceeding or otherwise.
Obviously great latitude concerning procedural details
is contemplated. Requirements of formality and rigidity
are altogether lacking. The notice must be "due," the
hearing "appropriate." These requirements are related
to the character of the proceeding of which the hearing
is only a part. That proceeding is not technical. It is
an "investigation," essentially informal, not adversary.
The investigation is not required to take any particular
form or confined to the hearing. The hearing is mandatory-"the Board shall provide for" it. But the requirement is only that it shall be provided "in any such investigation." The statute does not purport to specify when
dence. But, in any event, the Board says that if it was wrong as to
this in any respect the error was cured by the full hearing allowed
in February, 1944.

INLAND EMPIRE COUNCIL v. MILLIS.
697

707

Opinion of the Court.

or at what stage of the investigation the hearing shall be
had. It may be cQnducted "in conjunction with a proceeding under section 10 or otherwise."
Moreover, nothing in the section purports to require
a hearing before an election. Nothing in fact requires
an election. The hearing "in any such investigation" is
mandatory. But the election is discretionary. The Board
"may take a secret ballot . . .or utiliz6 any other suitable
method to ascertain such representatives."
An election, when held, is only a preliminary determination of fact. Sen. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.,
5-6; H. R. Rep. No. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 6-7. A
direction of election is but an intermediate step in the investigation, with certification as the final and effective
action. Labor Board v. International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, 308 U. S. 413, 414-415. Nothing
in § 9 (c) requires the Board to utilize the results of an
election or forbids it to disregard them and utilize other
suitable methods.
It hardly can be taken, in view of all these considerations, that Congress intended a hearing which it made
mandatory "in any such investigation" always to precede
an election which it made discretionary for all and which,
in the committee reports, it specifically denominated as
only a method for making a preliminary determination of
fact. That characterization was not beyond congressional authority to make and is wholly consistent with
the discretionary status the section gives that mode of
determination.
In view of the preliminary and factual function of an
election, we cannot agree with petitioners' view that only
a hearing prior to an election can be "appropriate" within
the section's meaning. The conclusive act of decision, in
the investigation, is the certification. Until it is taken,
what precedes is preliminary and tentative. The Board
is free to hold an election or utilize other suitable methods.

708

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

Such other methods are often employed and frequently
are of an informal character. Petitioners' view logically
would require the hearing to be held in advance of the use
of any such other method as much as when the method of
election is used.
Congress was fully informed concerning the effects of
mandatory hearings preceding elections upon the process
of certification. For under Public Resolution 44, which
preceded § 9 (c), the right of judicial hearing was provided. The'legislative reports cited above show that this
resulted in preventing a single certification after nearly a
year of the resolution's operation and that one purpose of
adopting the different provisions of the Wagner Act was
to avoid these consequences. 12 In doing so Congress accomplished its purpose not only by denying the right of
judicial review at that stage but also by conferring broad
discretion upon the Board as to the hearing which § 9 (c)
required before certification.
Petitioners' argument does not in terms undertake to
rewrite the statute. But the. effect would be to make it
read as if the words "appropriate . . . in any such investigation" were replaced with the words "hearing prior to any
election." Neither the language of the section nor the
legislative history discloses an intent to give the word "appropriate" such an effect. We think the statutory purpose rather is to provide for a learing in which interested
parties shall have full and adequate opportunity to present
their objections before the. Board concludes its investigation and makes its effective determination by the order
of certification.
In this case that opportunity was afforded to petitioners. We need not decide whether the hearing would have
been adequate or "appropriate," if the February, 1944,
hearing had not been granted and held. In the Board's
view, petitioners, when afforded the opportunity in the
12 Cf. note 9.

INLAND EMPIRE COUNCIL v. MILLIS. 709

Opinion of the Court.

proceedings to show cause held prior to the election,
brought forward nothing which, required it to hold a further hearing for the taking of evidence. With this petitioners disagree. We need not examine whether one or
the other was correct in its view. For when the objections
were renewed after the election, and others also were advanced, the Board gave full and adequate opportunity for
hearing, including the presentation of evidence, concerning them. Petitioners do not contend that the hearing
was a sham or that the Board did not consider their objections. They do not ask for review upon the merits.
Their only objection is that the hearing came too late.
That objection is not tenable in view of the statute's
terms and intent.
It may be, as petitioners insist, that their interests were
harmfully affected by the outcome of the election, through
loss of prestige and in other ways. It does not follow that
the injury is attributable to any failure of the Board to
afford a hearing which was "appropriate" within the section's meaning. This being true, and since petitioners do
not now question the Board's rulings upon the merits of
the issues apart from those relating to the character of
the hearing, the injury must be regarded, for presently
material purposes, as an inevitable result of losing an election which was properly conducted.
Petitioners also assert that the Board departed from
its own rules in failing to accord them the hearing demanded prior to the election. The regulations provide
for direction of election to follow the hearing before the
trial examiner and, in the Board's discretion, oral argument or further hearing as it may determine. Rules and
Regulations, Art. III, §§ 3, 8, 9. But the regulations also
contemplate further hearings for reconsideration before
the final act of certification, a procedure of which petitioners had full advantage in this case. Whether or not the
hearings provided before the election were adequate to

comply with the regulations, the procedure upon rehearing
afterward was adequate to perform its intended function of
affording full opportunity for correcting any defect which
may have existed in the previous stages of hearing.'
We think no substantial question of due process is presented. The requirements imposed by that guaranty are
not technical, nor is any particular form of procedure
necessary.

Morgan v. United States, 298 U. S. 468, 481.

"The demands of due process do not require a hearing,
at the initial stage or at any particular point or at more

than one point in an administrative proceeding so long
as the requisite hearing is held before the final order be-

That requirement was fully met in

this case.
The judgment is

Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS dissents.

18We need not determine whether in a situation where no hearing
whatever is afforded prior to an election, the failure would be cured
by allowing one afterward, whether as a matter of compliance with
the statute or with the regulations. , That situation is not presented.
The proceedings in this case prior to the election afforded opportunity
for hearing. At most the hearing was defective, and the opportunity
given by the postelection hearing was effective to cure, whatever
defects may have existed, if any.
