the offspring of his second marriage are not bastardized.
In that view Pennsylvania in this case might refuse to
alter its former order of support or might enlarge it, even
though Nevada in which the other spouse was domiciled
and obtained his divorce made a different provision for
support or none at all. See Radin, The Authenticated
Full Faith and Credit Clause, 39 Ill. L. Rev. 1, 28.
MR. JUSTICE BLACx joins in this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, concurring.

In accordance with the views which I have expressed
in Williams v. North Carolina,ante, p. 226, I do not think
full faith and credit have been given by the Pennsylvania
courts to the Nevada decree in this case. But upon the
basis of the Court's decision in that case, made applicable
also in this one, I concur in the result. In doing so, however, it is appropriate to indicate my agreement with the
views expressed in the concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS that the jurisdictional foundation for a decree in
one state capable of foreclosing an action for maintenance
or support in another may be different from that required
to alter marital status with extratevitorial effect.

Opinion of the Court.

The steps by which the case came here are these. On
August 8, 1944, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit filed a document entitled "Opinion"; on the
same day, the Clerk made a docket entry reading, "Order
reversed, A. N. Hand, C. J."; on August 29, 1944, a document entitled "Order for Mandate" was filed, and the
mandate issued that day; on November 29, 1944, the petition for writ of certiorari was filed. The petition was filed
too late if the "Opinion," as respondent contends, conIt was filed in time if the
stitutes the "judgment."
"Order for Mandate" may properly be deemed the "judgment." The issue was ably pressed before us, and, since
it concerns our power to review cases coming from what
is perhaps the busiest circuit, it calls for more than summary treatment.
Even long continued practice cannot alter the limits
within which Congress has bound the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. See Dept. of Banking v.. Pink, 317
U. S. 264. But such practice may be decisive in interpreting procedural ways which, as a matter of dialectic or
abstract analysis, .may appear dubious. We are naturally
impressed by the common understanding that in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the so-called
"Order for Mandate" is deemed the judgment. Robertson and Kirkham, Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
the United States (1936) § 384. We have taken and decided as a matter of course a considerable number of cases
in which certiorari was sought within three months after
entry of the "Order for Mandate" but not within three
months after the "Opinion." 2 This practical understanding of the controlling 'significance, for appellate

purposes, of the "Order for Mandate" is supported and
certainly not contradicted by all that is conveyed by the
"Opinion" and "Order for Mandate" and the Rules of the
lower court.
It does not detract from the "Opinion" as an opinion
that in its heading it gives as dates "Argued January 6,
1944. Decided August 8, 1944," and that it concludes
with "The order of the Tax Court is reversed." The same
or similar phrases are commonly employed in opinions of
this Court without changing their character as opinions.
Nor do like phrases in the opinions of the othertcircuit
courts of appeals turn them into judgments, since in all
other circuits judgment orders are separately filed. In
spite of its title, the "Order for Mandate" on its face fulfills
the function of such a judgment order. It recites that
"it is now hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the
order of said The Tax Court of the United States be and it
hereby is reversed.
"It is further ordered that a Mandate issue to the said
The Tax Court of the United States in accordance with
this decree.

DANIEL FuSARO,

This language plainly imports that this is the judgment
and that it is then being rendered. Nor does the fact that
the order was prepared by the clerk and bears his signature
detract from its quality as a judgment. A judgment "is
the act of the court," Ex parte Morgan, 114 U. S. 174, 175,
even though a clerk does all of the ministerial acts, as here,
in conformity with his court's standing instructions.

Opinion of the Court.

The Rules of the court below governing opinions, rehearings, issuance ofmandate and stay of mandate are invoked
to show that the "Opinion" is the appealable "judgment."
These Rules, like other rules, are not phrased with such
fastidious precision as to make of all the parts a perfect
harmony. But while substantial debating points may
be taken,' nothing in these Rules contradicts the natural
meaning yielded by the terms of the "Opinion" and the
"Order for Mandate," as reflected in the practice of the
Second Circuit and in our own, which treats not the
"Opinion" but the "Order for Mandate" as the order of
judgment. The Rules would have to be far less artistic
than they are to warrant us in holding that the Circuit
Court of Appeals has consistently misinterpreted some of
its own Rules. Whether the announcement of an opinion
and its entry in the docket amounts to a judgment for
purposes of appeal or whether that must await some later
formal act, ought not to be decided on nice-spun argumentation in disregard of the judicial habits of the court whose
judgment is called into question, of the bar practising be3 Respondent argues that the Rules of the court below, with respect to the opinions of the court, rehearings, issuance of mandate,
and stay of mandate, show that the "opinion" is meant to constitute
the court's judgment. But these Rules compute time,-with respect
to filing of petitions for rehearing and for issuance of mandate, not
from entry of a "judgment" but from the "filing of the opinion of this

court." Some difficulty is raised because Rule 27 refuses a rehearing
"unless a judge who concurred in the judgment desires it." Also respondent finds it paradoxical to "stay" the court's mandate under
Rule 30 when the mandate is customarily issued on the same day the
"Order for Mandate" is filed. And respondent argues that the court

could not have meant to confer upon its clerk discretion to hold up,
for varying lengths of time, the rendering of a judgment until fees

have been paid by the prevailing party. In this case the "Order for
Mandate" and issuance of the mandate were delayed for twenty-one
days, and were not entered within fifteen days from the filing of the
opinion which Rule 3and the court's instructions require; the time
has been variously extended in other cases.

fore it, of the clerk who embodies its procedural traditions,
as well as in conflict with the pssumption of the reviewing
court.
But now that the existing practice has revealed abstract
disharmonies, if not difficulties, the Circuit Court of Appeals will doubtless establish a more tidy system for meeting the technical requirements for review here. The
normal time fqr entering a judgment, as the starting point
for determining whether review will be sought or whether
there has been acquiescence in a judgment, should be fixed.
The uncertainties inherent in litigation should not be
needlessly prolonged. The entry of the "Order for Mandate," which in the Second Circuit begins the running of
the period for appeal, is apparently variable and vagrant.
In these days of rapid communication, the statutory
allowance of three months is more than ample for an
unsuccessful litigant to determine whether to seek further
review. So long a period ought not to be extended by delay
in entering a judgment nor should the burden of securing
such entry be put upon the successful litigant. There are
bound to be diversities in the modes of rendering and
recording judgments of the forty-eight systems of State
courts. Uniformity in the entry of judgment among the
eleven circuits forming the single federal judicature ought
to be capable of achievement without loss to the geographic flexibility of the system.
This brings us to the merits, which involve the validity
of an income tax deficiency assessment for 1937. The
case is this. The estate of Edward T. Bedford, who died
May 21, 1931, included 3,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock (par value $100) of Abercrombie & Fitch
Company. Pursuant to a plan of recapitalization respondent, as executor of the estate, in 1937 exchanged those
shares for 3,500 shares of cumulative preferred stock (par
value $75), 1,500 shares of common stock (par value $1),
and $45,240 in cash (on the basis of $15.08 for each of the
old preferred shares). The recapitalization -had been pro-

posed because the company, after charging against its surplus account stock dividends totaling $844,100, distributed
in 1920, 1928, and'1930, had incurred a book deficit in that
account of $399,771.87. Because of this deficit, the company, under applicable State law, was unable to pay dividends although for the fiscal year ending January 31,1937
it had net earnings of $309,073.70.
By comparing the fair market value of the old preferred
shares at the date of Bedford's death with the market value
of the new stock and cash received the gain to his estate,
was $139,740. Admittedly the recapitalization was a reorganization, § 112 (g) (1) (D) of the Revenue Act of 1936,
49 Stat. 1648, 1681, 26 U. S. C. § 112 (g) (1) (E), so that
only the cash received, but none of the stock, is taxable.
Sections 112 (b) (3), 112 (c) (1), 49 Stat. 1648, 1679, 1680,
26 U. S. C. §§ 112 (b) (3), 112 (c) (1). The sole issue is
whether the cash, $45,240, is taxable as a dividend, or
merely as a capital gain to the extent of 40%7o. The Tax
Court sustained the determination of the Commissioner
that the cash was taxable as a dividend, 1 T. C. 478, but
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 144 F. 2d
272. On a showing of importance to the administration of
the Revenue Acts, we granted certiorari. 323 U. S. 707.
The precise question is whether the distribution of cash
in this recapitalization "has the effect of the distribution
of a taxable dividend" under § 112 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1936 and as such is fully taxable, or is taxable
only at the rate of 40% as a capital gain under § 112 (c)
(1) of that Act. The relevant provisions read: "(c) Gain
from Exchanges not Solely in Kind.-(1) If an exchange
would be within the provisions of subsection (b) (1), (2),
(3), or (5) of this section if it were not for the fact that
the property received in exchange consists not only of
property permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or
money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such

money and the fair market value of such other property.
(2) If a distribution made in pursuance of a plan of reorganization is within the provisions of paragraph (1) of
this subsection but has the effect of the distribution of a
taxable dividend, then there shall be taxed as a dividend
to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) as is not in excess of his ratable
share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the
corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The
remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be taxed as 6, gain from the exchange of
property."
The history of this legislation is not illuminating. Section 112 (c) (2) originated in § 203 (d) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 257. But the reports of the
Congressional Committees merely use the language of
the section to explain it. H. Rep. No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st
Sess., pp. 14-15; S. Rep. No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.,
pp. 15-16. Nor does the applicable Treasury Regulation
add anything; it repeatA substantially the Committee Reports. Treas. Reg. 94, Art. 112 (g)-4. We are thrown
back upon the legislative language for ascertaining the
meaning which will best accord with the aims of the language, the practical administration of the law and relevant
judicial construction.
Although Abercrombie & Fitch showed a book deficit in
the surplus account because the earlier stock dividends had
been charged against it, the parties agree that for corporate tax purposes at least earnings and profits exceeding
the distributed cash had been earned at the time of the
recapitalization. That cash therefore came out of earnings and profits and such a distribution would normally
be considered a taxable dividend, see § 115 (a), and has so
"(a). 'Definition of Dividend.-The term 'dividend' when used in
this title (except in section 203 (a) (3) and section 207 (c) (1), relating to insurance companies) means any distribution made by a

been treated by the courts in seemingly similar situations.
It has been ruled in a series of cases that where the stock
of one corporation was exchanged for the stock of another and cash and then distributed, such distributions out
of earnings and profits had the effect of a distribution of
a taxable dividend under § 112 (c)-(2). Comm'rv. Owens,
69 F. 2d 597; Comm'r v. Forhan Realty Corp., 75 F. 2d
268; Rose v. Little Investment Co., 86 F. 2d 50; Love v.
Comin'r, 113 F. 2d 236; Campbell v. United States, 144
F. 2d 177. The Tax Court has reached the same result,
that is, has treated the distribution as a taxable dividend,
in the case of the recapitalization of a single corporation.
McCord v. Comm'r, 31 B. T. A. 342, 344; J. Weingarten,
Inc. v. Comm'r, 44 B. T. A. 798,808-809; Knapp Monarch
Co. v. Comm'r, 1 T. C. 59, 69-70, affirmed on other
grounds, 139 F. 2d 863. We cannot distinguish the two
situations and find no implication in the statute restricting
§ 112 (c) (2) to taxation as a dividend only in the case of
an exchange of stock and assets of two corporations.
Respondent, however, claims that this distribution more
nearly has the effect of a "partial liquidation" as defined
in § 115 (i). But the classifications of § 115, which governs "Distributions of Corporations" apart from reorganizations, were adopted for another purpose. They do pot
apply to a situation arising within § 112. The definition
of a "partial liquidation" in § 115 (i) is specifically limited
.corporation to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property, (1) out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28,
1913, or (2) out of the earnings or profits of the taxable year (computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year), without
regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the
distribution was made."
-5"(i). Definition of PartialLiquidatio.--As used in this section
the term 'amounts distributed in partial liquidation' means a distribution by a corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of a
,part of its stock, or one of a series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all or a portion of its stock."

to use in § 115. To attempt to carry it over to § 112 would
distort its purpose. That limitation is not true of § 115 (a)
which defines "dividend" for the purpose of the whole
title. Accordingly, thi& definition is infused into § 112
(c) (2). Under § 115 (a) a distribution out of accumu-.
lated earnings and profits is a "dividend," thus confirming
the conclusion that a distribution of earnings and profits
has the "effect of the distribution of a taxable dividend"
under § 112 (c) (2).
Recapitalization does not alter the "effect." Although
the capital of a company is reduced, the cash received is
a distribution of earnings and profits and as such falls
within the federal tax. That the company's treatment of
its stock dividends may bring consequences under State
law requiring a capital reduction does not alter the character of the transactions which bring them within the federal income tax. Recapitalization is one of the forms of
reorganization under § 112 (g) (1) (D). It cannot therefore be urged as a reason for taking the transaction out of
the requirements of § 112 and forcing it into the mold of
§ 115. The reduction of capital brings § 112 into operation
and does not give immunity from the requirements of § 112
(c) (2).
Treating the matter as a problem of statutory construction for our independent judgment, we hold that a distribution, pursuant to a reorganization, of earnings and profits "has the effect of a distribution of a taxable dividend"
within § 112 (c) (2). As is true of other teasing questions of construction raised by technical provisions of Revenue Acts the matter is not wholly free from doubt. But
these doubts would have to be stronger than they are to
displace the informed views of the Tax Court. And if the
case can be reduced to its own particular circumstances
rather than turn on a generalizing principle we should feel
bound to apply Dobson v. Commissioner,320 U. S. 489, and
sustain the Tax Court.
