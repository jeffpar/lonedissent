service of process issued out of a state court, even if one
which itself is unable to proceed to judgment, if the state
law or practice directs or permits the transfer through
change of venue or otherwise to a court which does have
jurisdiction to hear, try, and otherwise determine that
cause. Whether the action would be barred if state law
made new or §upplemental process necessary is a question
not involved here and not decided. Clearly, however,
when process has been adequate to bring in the parties
and to start the case on a course- of judicial handling which
may lead to final judgment without issuance of new initial
process, it is enough to commence the action within the
federal statute. As these cases were dismissed solely because of a contrary view, the judgments are reversed and
the causes remanded to the Supreme Court of Illinois
for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinions herein.

HOOVER COMPANY v. COE, COMMISSIONER OF
PATENTS.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 486. Argued March 5, 1945.-Decided April 30, 1945.
1. A federal district court has jurisdiction of a suit under R. S. § 4915
to review a decision of the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office
rejecting a claim as not reading on the disclosure in the application
for a patent. Pp. 80, 83.
Jurisdiction is not defeated by the fact that an adjudication
favorable to the applicant might not conclude all possible qu.estions as to the applicant's right to a patent.
2. The right of the applicant in such case to sue under R. S. § 4915.
is supported by the language of the statute, its legislative history,

CERTIORARI, 323 U. S. 697, to review the affirmance of a
judgment dismissing a suit against the Commissioner of
Patents under R. S. § 4915.

Messrs. William D. Sellers and Richard R. Fitzsimmons, with whom Mr. William S. Hodges was on the brief,
for petitioner.
Mr. T. Hayward Brown argued the cause, and Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Shea, Messrs.
Robert L. Stern, Joseph B. Goldman and Joseph Houghton were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is whether a District Court has
jurisdiction of a suit under R. S. 49151 to review the refusal
of a claim for patent as not reading on the application.
The court below answered in the negative.
The respondent confesses error. The language of the
Act, its legislative history, administrative practice, and
judicial construction, constrain us to hold that the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit and that the Court
of Appeals should have reviewed its decision upon the
merits.
January 10, 1941, the petitioner's assignor filed
application for a reissue of a patent granted November 7, 1939,
on an original application of August 8, 1936. The alleged
invention is for improvements in a refrigerating system.
A number of claims included in the application for reissue
*were copied, or substantially copied, from several later
patents, in order to provoke interferences therewith and
a contest as to priority of invention.
The Primary Examiner finally rejected four of the
claims, stating that they were rejected "as not reading on
applicant's disclosure." The Board of Appeals of the Pat'35 U. S.C. § 63.

ent Office affirmed the Examiner's decision. The petitioner then brought suit against the Commissioner of Patents under R. S. 4915 in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia, to compel him to allow the
four claims, to the end that interference proceedings might
be instituted. The case was heard on the Patent Office
record and additional -evidence. The court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and dismissed the complaint on the ground that the claims did not read on, that
is, did not accurately describe, the disclosure in the
application.
On appeal the court below on its own motion raised the
question "whether [R. S. 4915] confers jurisdiction on the
District Court to enter a decree which does not determine
the right of the applicant to receive a patent but which instead directs the examiner to allow claims for the purpose
of provoking subsequent interference proceedings." The
parties were heard upon this question and the court decided
that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the suit, and
on that ground affirmed its judgment of dismissal.2
R. S. 4915 is in part:
"Whenever a patent on application is refused by the
Board of Appeals or whenever any applicant is dissatisfied
with the decision of the board of interference examiners,
the applicant, unless appeal has been taken to the United
States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and such
appeal is pending or has been decided, in which case no
action may be brought under this section, may have remedy by bill in equity, if filed within six months after such
refusal or decision; and the court having cognizance
thereof, on notice to adverse parties and other due proceedings had, may adjudge that such applicant is entitled,
according to law, to receive a patent for his invention,
as specified in his claim or for any part thereof, as the facts

in the case may appear. And such adjudication, if it be
in favor of the right of the applicant, shall authorize the
commissioner to issue such patent on the applicant filing
in the Patent Office a copy of the adjudication and otherwise complying with the requirements of law. In all cases
where there is no opposing party a copy of the bill shall
be served on the commissioner; and all the expenses of
the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant, whether
the final decision is in his favor or not."
The court below held that in conformity to the general
rule, a court of equity ought not to afford piecemeal relief
pending completion of the administrative process, and consequently ought not to entertain a suit under the statute
unless its adjudication would conclude all possible questions as to the right to a patent.
1. On its face the statute confers the right to sue "Whenever a patent on application is refused by the Board of
Appeals." The patent applied for (that is, the claims in
question) was finally refused by the Board of Appeals.
No appeal was taken to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and petitioner filed its bill
within the time limited in the section.
Two matters may be noted respecting R. S. 4915. These
are the denial of jurisdiction if appeal has been taken to
the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals
and the statement that adjudication in favor of the applicant shall authorize the Commissioner to issue a patent. These provisions require reference to R. S. 4911, as
amended. That section provides:
"If any applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the
board of appeals, he may appeal to the United States
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, in which case he
waives his right to proceed under section 63 [R. S. 4915]
of this title. If any party to an interference is dissatisfied
with the decisin of the board of interference examiners,
he may appeal to the United States Court of Customs and

Opinion of the Court.

Patent Appeals: Provided, That such appeal shall be
dismissed if any adverse party to sucb interference shall,
within twenty days after the appellant shall have filed
notice of appeal according to section 60 of this title, file
notice with the Commissioner of Patents that he elects
to have all further proceedings conducted as provided in. '
Section 63 [R. S. 4915]. Thereupon the appellant shall
have thirty days thereafter within 'which to file a bill in
equity under said section 63 [R. S. 4915], in default of
which the decisions appealed from shall govern the further
proceedings in the case."
It is evident that alternative rights of review are accorded an applicant,-one by appeal to the United States
Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the other by bill
in equity filed in one of the federal district 'courts. In
the first the hearing is summary and solely on the record
made in the Patent Office; ' in the other a formal trial is
afforded on proof which may include evidence not presented in the Patent Office.4 Every party adversely
affected by a ruling on the merits may, if he so elect, proceed by bill rather than by appeal. In the one case- the
adjudication in equity authorizes issue of a patent on the
applicant's "otherwise complying with the requirements
of law." In the other the decision "shall govern the
further proceedings in the case" in the Patent Office.'
The question is whether the differences in the character
of the proceedings and the statutory effect of decision or
adjudication require a holding that as to all decisions on
the merits adverse to the applicant, other than the final
action as to the issue of a patent, the applicant must obtain review by appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals, and can proceed by bill under R. S. 4915 only
when every step requisite to issue has been taken. If so,

the language of R. S. 4915 is ill chosen. "Whenever a
patent on application is refused" states precisely this case.
The petitioner's application was refused. "Whenever
any applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board
of interference examiners" states a case where the examiner's decision may be only one of a series of rulings in
the Patent Office prior to issue of a patent. It can hardly
be that these phrases have no effect and are to be read as
"Whenever, after all administrative steps are complete
and a patent is about to issue, any person aggrieved may
have remedy by bill in equity." If that be the correct
construction, one finally denied a patent could not resort
to the specified remedy, since, even if his contention were
sustained, he might thereafter have to leap the hurdles in
the Patent Office of interferences, later references, and
other obstacles to patentability.
On the face of the statutes the applicant is given alternative remedies resulting in the same sort of relief so far as
concerns the further prosecution of the application in the
Patent Office.
2. The legislative history confirms the view that Congress so intended.
That history cannot be stated briefly. It has its origin
in the Patent Act of 1836 8 which afforded an applicant
aggrieved by a ruling of the Commissioner an appeal to a
board of examiners.' By a later section it was provided
that "whenever a patent on application shall have been
refused on an adverse decision of a board of examiners, on
the ground that the patent applied for would interfere
with an unexpired patent," the applicant might have
remedy by bill in equity; and the court might adjudge the
applicant entitled to a patent, according to his claim or
any part of it. Adjudication favorable to the applicant
was to "authorize the Commissioner to issue such patent"
on the applicant's filing a copy of the adjudication "and

7 § 7, 5 Stat. 119-120.

otherwise complying with the requisitions of this act."8
It will be noted that a bill might be filed under this statute
only where the rejection of a claim was for interference
with an outstanding patent. By the Act of March 3,
1837,' the same remedy was afforded an applicant for patent for an improvement or for "correction and re-issue."
By the Act of March 3, 1839," the same remedy was
extended "to all cases where patents are refused for any
reason whatever, either by the Commissioner of Patents
or by the chief justice of the District of Columbia, upon
appeals from the decision of said Commissioner," as well
as where the refusal was based on asserted interference.
The reason for adding the phrase concerning the decision
of the Chief Justice was that, by § 11 1 of the same Act,
a summary appeal on the Patent Office record to this judicial officer was substituted for the former appeal to a
board of examiners given by the Act of 1836.2
Thus a District Court might set aside, on bill filed, any
ruling refusing a patent, either on interference or otherwise, whether the ruling were that of the Patent Office or
of a judge of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia
on appeal from the Patent Office decision.
The Act of July 8, 1870,1" amended, revised, and consolidated existing law. In § 48 " it enacted that in ex
parte cases an applicant for patent or reissue whose claims
had been twice rejected might appeal to the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia. The hearing was to
be summary, to be on the office record, and the decision

was "to govern the further proceedings in the case." 1
In § 52 it provided that whenever a patent on application
"is refused, for any reason whatever," either, by the Commissioner or by the Supreme Court of the District upon
appeal, the remedy by bill in equity should be available.
The adjudication was to authorize the issue of a patent
on the applicant's filing a copy in the Patent Office "and
otherwise complying with the requisitions of law." This
statute was construed to require an appeal to the District
Supreme Court as a condition precedent to the maintenance of a bill in equity."8
The provisions of the Act of 1870 were codified in the
Revised Statutes of 1873.1' In the process the words "for
any reason whatever" were deleted from § 52, which became R. S. 4915. The omission was evidently because
the words were surplusage, since the purpose of the revisers was not "to attempt any change whatever in the existing law" except "mere changes of phraseology not affecting
the meaning of the law." 18
By the Act of February 9, 1893 11 the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia was created and jurisdiction
of summary appeals from Patent Office rulings was transferred to that court. Thus the remedy by bill in equity
was now to be pursued in a District Court only after an
appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District had resulted
adversely to the applicant; and an adjudication in the
equity suit was subjected to review on appeal.
So matters stood until the passage of the Act of March 2,
1927.1 In the hearings on the bill which became the statute, it was proposed that Congress eliminate either the

appeal or the bill in equity, some interested parties suggesting abolition of the one remedy, others advocating
dropping the other. Congress decided not to do away
with either, but to allow an applicant "to have the decision
of the Patent Office reviewed either by the court of appeals or by filing a bill in equity, but not both." 21 It is
evident that no alteration in respect of the rulings which
could be reviewed was intended; but the number of possible appeals was to be reduced, while saving to litigants
the option of producing new evidence in a court, by
retaining the equity procedure."
Finally, the Act of March 2, 1929 2 transferred from the
Court of Appeals of the District to the Court of Customs
and Patent Appeals jurisdiction of appeals from the Patent Office, but ex industriaprovided "Nothing contained
in this Act shall be construed as affecting in any way the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia in equity cases." This was of course to make
it plain that suits in the District Court of the "Districtof
Columbia should be appealable as are suits under R. S.
4915 instituted in district courts in circuits outside the
District.
Thus it is clear that throughout more than a century
Congress has for correction of erroneous adverse rulings,
which if unreversed would end the proceedings in the Patent Office, preserved the remedy by bill in a District Court

either as additional to or alternative to that by summary
appeal and has made the effect of adjudication in equity
the same as that of decision on appeal.
3. The Commissioner of Patents states that "when
claims are finally rejected by the examiner and his action
is affirmed by the Board of Appeals, the grounds then
stated for such rejection, as well as any other grounds in
support thereof, may be set up by this Office in answer to
a. subsequent suit by the applicant under Rev. Stat. 4915.
If the adjudication by the court is favorable to the applicant, it is the practice of this Office to treat that judgment
as conclusive with respect to any ground of rejection
urged before the court in defense of the refusal to allow
the claims in issue. In the usual case, following such
adjudication, the application is allowed and, upon payment of the prescribed fee, the patent is issued. However,
in rare instances where, after termination of the suit, a
new reference is discovered which shows lack of patentability of the claims for a reason not considered by the
court, this Office considers itself under a duty to reject
the claims on the newly discovered ground, and to refuse
a patent on those claims unless the applicant can overcome the new ground of rejection. Similarly, if another
applicant or a patentee is claiming substantially the same
subject matter as that held patentable in the Rev. Stat.
4915 suit, and a question of priority arises, interference
proceedings may be necessary under Rev. Scat. 4904 to
determine which of the adverse claimants is the first inventor. .

The foregoing is believed to have been the

consistent practice of this Office for many years."

was not involved in the cases under adjudication. The
lower federal courts have consistently construed the section as conferring jurisdiction in cases which are indistinguishable from that at bar.25 They have so held in cases
where it affirmatively appeared that further proceedings in
the Patent Office would be necessary following adjudication in favor of the applicant," and where though it did not
appear of record that further proceedings would be required in the Patent Office, it was evident that they might
ensue adjudication, as where a patent was denied for want
of invention.27 And, where an applicant has succeeded
in a bill filed under R. S. 4915, the courts have not
questioned the power of the Patent Office subsequently
to disallow the claims for want of invention
over a newly
28
discovered reference to the prior art.
The court below relied upon Hill v. Wooster, 132 U. S.
693, for its holding that a suit under R. S. 4915 cannot
select a single issue which affects the applicant's right to
a patent, without determining all the other issues on
which that right depends. That case was one in which the
Commissioner had decided an interference between the
claims of two applicants in favor of one of them, and ordered that a patent issue. In an inter partes suit by the
unsuccessful applicant against the successful one, this

court held that if it appeared that neither application
disclosed invention (a matter which should have moved
the Commissioner not to declare an interference) the bill
should be dismissed. " The court did,not purport to decide what Patent Office rulings are reviewable under R. S.
4915. 31
The ruling of the Board of Appeals in the instant case
was neither a procedural ruling"1 nor an interlocutory
one 32as to which the District Court should not entertain
a suit under R. S. 4915. On the contrary, it finally denied
a patent on the claims presented. In this respect it was
like a dismissal of a suit in a court. Unless the applicant
could sue to correct error in that dismissal, he could never
sue under R. S. 4915. That he was accorded a right of
suit in this case the language of the statute, its history, the
administrative construction and judicial decision unite in
affirming.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for
further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.
Reversed.

29 Section 16 of the Act of 1836, 5 Stat. 123, supra, expressly provided that upon a bill filed as a result of Patent Office decision on an
interference the court might adjudge either of the patents void in
whole or in part. This language was evidently omitted in later acts
as surplusage, for obviously if either patent was void for lack of invention or other cause, the question of interference disappeared.
