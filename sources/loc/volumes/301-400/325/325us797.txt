INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 702. Argued March 8, 9, 194&-Decided June 18, 1945.
1. It is a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act for labor unions and
their members, though furthering their own interests as wage
earners, to combine with employers and with manufacturers of
goods to restrain competition in, and to monopolize the marketing
of, such goods in interstate commerce. Pp. 798, 810.
2. Congress did not intend by the Clayton Act or the NorrisLaGuardia Act that labor unions could, consistently with the
Sherman Act, aid non-labor groups to create business monopolies
and to control the marketing of goods and services. P.' 808.
3. In § 6 of the Clayton Act, which provides that the Sherman Act is
not to be so construed as to forbid the "existence and operation
of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations instituted for
the purpose of mutual help," "the purpose of mutual help" can not
be deemed to extend to activities for the purpose of "employer
help" in controlling markets and prices. P. 808.
4. Whether particular labor union activities violate the Sherman Act
may depend upon whether the union acts alone or in combination
with business groups. P. 810.
5. It was the purpose of Congress in the antitrust legislation to outlaw
business monopolies; and a business monopoly is no less such
because a union participates. P. 811.
6. The injunction against the union and its agents in this case must
be limited so as to enjoin only those prohibited activities which
were engaged in in combination with a non-labor group. P. 812.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

MR_.

325 U. S.

JUSTIcE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is whether it is a violation of the
Sherman Anti-trust Act' for labor unions and their members, prompted by a desire to get and hold jobs for themselves at good wages and under high working standards,
to combine with employers and with manufacturers of
goods to restrain competition in, and to monopolize the
marketing of, such goods.
Upon the complaint of petitioners and after a lengthy
hearing the District Court held that such a combination
did violate the Sherman Act, entered a declaratory judgment to that effect, and entered an injunction restraining
respondents from engaging in a wide range of specified
activities. 41 F. Supp. 727, 51 F. Supp. 36.. The Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed the decision and dismissed the
cause, holding that combinations of unions and business
men which restrained trade and tended to monopoly were
not in violation of the Act where the bona fide purpose
of the unions was to raise wages, provide better working
conditions, and bring about better conditions of employment for their members. 145 F. 2d 215. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals having reached a contrary conclusion in a similar case, 144 F. 2d 546, we granted certiorari
in both cases.
The facts were sufficiently set out in the opinions below
and need not be detailed again. The following summary
will suffice for our purposes.
Petitioners are manufacturers of electrical equipment.
Their places of manufacture are outside of New York City,
and most of them are outside of New York State as well.
They have brought this action because of their desire to
sell their products inNew York City, a market area that
has been closed to them through the activities of
respondents and others.
'26 Stat. 209; 50 Stat. 693.

ALLEN BRADLEY CO. v. UNION.
797

Opinion of the Court.

Respondents are a labor union, its officials and its members. The union, Local No. 3 of the International,
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, has jurisdiction only
over the metropolitan area of New York City. It is therefore impossible for the union to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with petitioners. Some of petitioners
do have collective bargaining agreements with other
unions, and in some cases even with other locals of the
I. B. E.W.
Some of the members of' respondent union work for
manufacturers who produce electrical equipment similar
to that made by petitioners; other members of responaent
union are employed by contractors and work on the
installation of electrical equipment, rather than in its
production.
The union's consistent aim for many years has been to
expand its membership, to obtain shorter hours and increased wages, and to enlarge employment opportunitie§
for its members. To achieve this latter goal-that is,
to make more work for its own members-the union
realized that local manufacturers, employers of the local
members, must have the widest possible outlets for their
product. The union -therefore waged aggressive campaigns to obtain closed-shop agreements with all local electrical equipment manufacturers and contractors. Using
conventional labor union methods, such as strikes and boycotts, it gradually obtained more and more closed-shop
agreements in the New York City area. Under these
agreements, contractors were obligated to purchase equipment from none but local manufacturers who also had
closed-shop agreements with Local No. 3; manufacturers
obligated themselves to confine their New York City sales
to contractors employing the Local's members. In the
course of time, this type of individual employer-employee
agreement expanded into industry-wide understandings,
looking not merely to terms and conditions of employ-

ment but also to price and market control. Agencies were
set up composed of representatives of all three groups to
boycott recalcitrant local contractors and manufacturers
and to bar from the area equipment manufactured outside
its boundaries. The combination among the three groups,
union, contractors, and manufacturers, became highly
successful from the standpoint of all of them. The business of New York City manufacturers had a phenomenal
growth, thereby multiplying the jobs available for the
Local's members. Wages went up, hours were shortened,
and the New York electrical equipment prices soared, to
the decided financial profit of local contractors and manufacturers. The success is illustrated by the fact that some
New York manufacturers sold their goods in the protected
city market at one price and sold identical goods outside
of New York at a far lower price. All of this took place,
as the Circuit Court of Appeals declared, "through the
stifling of competition," and because the three -groups, in
combination as "co-partners," achieved "a complete
monopoly which they used to boycott the equipment manufactured by the plaintiffs." Interstate sale of various
,types of electrical equipment has, by this powerful
combination, been wholly suppressed.
Quite obviously, this combination of business men has
violated both §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Ac&,' unless
its conduct is immunized by the participation of the union.
For it intended to and did restrain trade in and monopo1 and 2 provide in part as follows:
"See. 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the
several States, or with foreign' nations, is hereby declared to be
illegal .. .
"Sec. 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several
States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . .

lize the supply of electrical equipment in the New York
City area to the exclusion of equipment manufactured in
and shipped from other states, and did also control its price
and discriminate between its would-be customers. Apex
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 512-513. Our problem in this case is therefore a very narrow one-do labor
unions violate the Sherman Act when, in order to further
their own interests as wage earners, they aid and abet
business men to do the precise things which that Act
prohibits?
The Sherman Act as originally passed contained no
language expressly exempting any labor union activities.
Sharp controversy soon arose as to whether the Act applied to unions. One viewpoint was that the only evil at
which Congress had aimed was high consumer prices
achieved through combinations looking to control of markets by powerful groups; that those who would have a
great incentive for such combinations would be the business men who would be the direct beneficiaries of them;
therefore, the argument proceeded, Congress drafted its
law to apply only to business combinations, particularly
the large trusts, and not to labor unions or any of their
activities as such. Involved in this viewpoint were the
following contentions: that the Sherman Act is a law to
regulate trade, not labor, a law to prescribe the rules governing barter and sale, and not the personal relations of
employers and employees; that good wages and working
conditions helped and did not hinder trade, even though
increased labor costs might be reflected in the cost of products; that labor was not a commodity; that laborers had
an inherent right to accept or terminate employment at
their own will, either separately or in concert; that to enforce their claims for better wages and working conditions,
they had a right to refuse to buy goods from their employer or anybody else; that what they could do to aid
their cause, they had a right to persuade others to do;

and that the Anti-trust laws designed to regulate trading
were unsuitable to regulate employer-employee relations
and controversies. The claim was that the history of the
legislation supported this line of argument.8
The contrary viewpoint was that the Act covered all
classes of people and all types of combinations, including
unions, if their activities even physically interrupted the
free flow of trade or tended to create business monopolies,
and that a combination of laborers to obtain a raise in
wages was itself a prohibited monopoly. Federal courts
adopted the latter view and soon applied the law to unions
in a number of cases.' Injunctions were used to enforce
the Act against unions. At the same time, employers invoked injunctions to restrain labor union activities even
where no violation of the Sherman Act was charged.
Vigorous protests arose from employee groups. The
unions urged congressional relief from what they considered to be two separate, but partially overlapping evilsapplication of the Sherman Act to unions, and issuance
of injunctions against strikeq boycotts and other labor
union weapons. Numerous bills to curb injunctions were

offered. Other proposed legislation was intended to take
labor unions wholly outside any possible application of the
Sherman Act. All of this is a part of the well known
history of the era between 1890 and 1914.1
To amend, supplement and strengthen the Sherman Act
against monopolistic business practices, and in response to
the complaints of the unions against injunctions and application of the Act to them, Congress in 1914 passed the
Clayton Act.' Elimination of those "trade practices"
which injuriously affected competition was its first objective.! Each section of the measure prohibiting such trade
practices contained language peculiarly appropriate to
commercial transactions as distinguished from labor union
activities, but there is no record indication in anything
that was said or done in its passage which indicates that
those engaged in business could escape its or the Sherman
Act's prohibitions by obtaining the help of labor unions or
others. That this bill was intended to make it all the
more certain that competition should be the rule in all
commercial transactions is clear from its language and
history.
In its treatment of labor unions and their activities the
Clayton Act pointed in an opposite direction. Congress
in that Act responded to the prolonged complaints 8
concerning application of the Sherman law to labor groups
by adopting § 6; for this purpose, and also drastically to

restrict the general power of federal courts to issue labor
injunctions, § 20 10 was adopted. Section 6 declared that
labor was neither a commodity nor an article of commerce,
and that the Sherman Act should not be "construed to
forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural,
or horticultural organizations, instituted for the purposes
of mutual help . . ." Section 20 limited the power of
courts to issue injunctions in a case "involving or growing
out of a labor dispute over terms or conditions of employment . . ." It declared that no restraining order or injunction should prohibit certain specified acts, and further
declared that no one of these specified acts should be "held
to be violations of any law of the United States." This
Act was broadly proclaimed by many as labor's "Magna
Carta," wholly exempting labor from any possible incluthe purposes of mutual help, and not having capital stock or conducted

for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof;

nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or
construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of
trade, under the antitrust laws."
10 Section 20 reads in part as follows: "And no such restraining
order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether
singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment,
or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending,
advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from
attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating
information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or
to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ
any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying
or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute,
any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from
peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes;
or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the
absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the
acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations
of any law of the United States."

sion in the, Anti-trust legislation; others, however,
strongly denied this.
This Court later declined to interpret the Clayton Act as
manifesting a congressional purpose wholly to exempt
labor unions from the Sherman Act. Duplex Co. v.
Deering,254 U. S. 443; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stone Cutters' Assn., 274 U. S. 37. In those cases
labor unions had engaged in a secondary boycott; they had
boycotted dealers, by whom the union members were not
employed, because those dealers insisted on selling goods
produced by the employers with whom the unions had
an existing controversy over terms and conditions of
employment. This Court held that the Clayton Act exempted labor union activities only insofar as those activities were directed against the employees' immediate
employers and that controversies over the sale of goods
by other dealers did not constitute "labor disputes" within
the meaning of the Clayton Act.
Again the unions went to. Congress. They protested
against this Court's interpretation, repeating the arguments they had made against application of the Sherman
Act to them. Congress adopted their viewpoint, at least
in large part, and in order to escape the effect of the
Duplex and Bedford decisions,1 passed' the NorrisLaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70. That Act greatly broadened
the meaning this CQurt had attributed to the words "labor
dispute," further restricted the use of injunctions in such
a dispute, and emphasized the public importance under
modern economic conditions of protecting the rights of
employees to organize into unions and to engage in "concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining
or other mutual aid and protection." This congressional
purpose found further expression in the Wagner Act, 49
Stat. 449.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

We said in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, 488, that
labor unions are still subject to the Sherman Act to "some
extent not defined." The opinion in that case, however,
went on to explain that the Sherman Act "was enacted
in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses
and of capital organized and directed to control of the
market by suppression of competition in the marketing
of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which
'had become a matter of public concern"; that its purpose
was to.protect consumers from monopoly prices, and not
to serve as a comprehensive code to regulate and police
all kinds and types of interruptions and obstructions to
the flow of trade. This was a recognition of the fact that
Congress had accepted the arguments made continuously
since 1890 by groups opposing application of the Sherman
Act to unions. It was an int6rpretatiQn commanded by
a fair consideration of the full history of Anti-trust and
labor legislation.
United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, declared that
the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts must
be jointly considered in arriving at a conclusion as to
whether labor union activities run counter to the Antitrust legislation. . Conduct which they permit is not to
be declared a violation of federal law. That decision held
that the doctrine of the Duplex and Bedford cases was
inconsistent with the congressional policy set out in the
three "interlacing statutes."
The result of all this is that we have two declared congressional policies which it is our responsibility to try to
reconcile. The one seeks to preserve a competitive business economy; the other to preserve the rights of labor
to organize to better its conditions through the agency of
collective bargqining. -We must determine here how far.
Congress intended activities under one of these polities to
neutralize the results envisioned by the other.

-ALLEN BRADLEY CO. v.. UNION.
797

807

Opinion of the Court.

Aside from the fact that the labor union here acted in
combination with the contractors and manufacturers, the
means it adopted to contribute to the combination's purpose fall squarely within the "specified acts" declared by
§ 20 not to be violations of federal law.12 For the union's
contribution to the trade boycott was accomplished
through threats that unless their employers bought their
goods from local manufacturers the union laborers would
terminate the "relation of employment" with them and
cease to perform "work or labor" for them; and through
their "recommending, advising, or persuading others by
peaceful and lawful means" not to "patronize" sellers of
the boycotted electrical equipment. Consequently, under
our holdings in the Hutcheson case and other cases which
followed it,"8 had there been no union-contractor-manufacturer combination the union's actions here, coming as
they did within the exemptions of the Clayton and NorrisLaGuardia Acts, would not have been violations of the
Sherman Act. We pass to the question of whether uilions
can with impunity aid and abet business men who are
violating the Act.
On two occasions this Court has held that the Sherman
Act was violated by a combination of labor unions and
business men to restrain trade." In neither of them was

1t has been argued that no labor disputes existed. The argument is untenable. We do not have here, as we did in Columbia
River Packers Assn. v. Hinton, 315 U. S. 143, a dispute between
groups of business men revolying solely around the price'at which
one group would sell commodities to another group. On the contrary, Local No. 3 is a labor union and its spur to action related t6
wages and working conditions.

the Court's attention sharply called to the crucial questions
here presented. Furthermore, both were decided before
the passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and prior to
our holding in the Hutcheson case. It is correctly argued
by respondents that these factors greatly detract from
the weight which the two cases might otherwise have in
the instant case. See United States v. Hutcheson, supra,
236. Without regard to these cases, however, we think
Congress never intended that unions could, consistently
with the Sherman -Act, aid non-labor groups to create
business monopolies and to control the marketing of goods
and services.
Section 6 of the Clayton Act declares that the Sherman
Act must not be so construed as to forbid the "existence
and operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, instituted for the purposes of mutual help
."
But "the purpose of mutual help" can hardly be
thought to cover activities for the purpose of "employer"help" in controlling markets and prices. And in an analogous situation where an agricultural association joined
with other groups to control the agricultural market, we
said:
"The right 9 f these agricultural producers thus to unite
in preparing for market and in marketing their products,
and to make the contracts which are necessary for that
collaboration, cannot be deemed to authorize any combination or conspiracy with other persons in restraint of
trade that these producers may see fit to devise." United
States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188, 204-205. (Italics
supplied.)
We have been pointed to no language in any act of Congress or in its reports or debates, nor have we found any,
which indicates that it was ever suggested, considered, or
legislatively 'determined that labor unions should be
granted an immunity such as is sought in the present case.
It has been argued that this immunity can be inferred

from a union's right to make bargaining agreements with
its employer. Since union members can without violating the Sherman Act strike to enforce a union boycott of
goods, it is said they may settle the strike by getting their
employprs to agree to refuse to buy the goods. Employers and the union did here make bargaining agreements
in which the employers agreed not to buy goods manufactured by companies which did not employ the members
of Local No. 3. We may. assume that such an agreement
standing alone would not have violated the Sherman Act.
But it did not stand alone., It was but one element in a
far larger program in which contractors find manufactur-.
ers united with one another to monopolize all the b5usiness
in New York City, to bar all other business men"from that
area, and to charge the public prices above a competitive
level. It is true that victory of the union in its disputes,
even had the union acted alone, might have added to the
cost of goods, or might have resulted in individual refusals
of all 6 their employers to buy electrical equipment not
made by Local No. 3. So far as the union might have
achieved this result acting alone, it would have been the
natural consequence of labor -union activities exempted
by the Clayton Act from the coverage of the Sherman Act.
Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra, 503. But when the
unions participated with a combination of business men
who had complete power to eliminate all competition
among themselves and to prevent all competition from
others, a situation was created not included within the
exemptions of the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts.
It must be remembered that the exemptions granted the
unions were special exceptions to a general legislative
plan. The primary objective of all the Anti-trust legislation has been to preserve business competition and to
proscribe business monopoly. It would be a surprising
thing if Congress, in order to prevent a misapplication
of that legislation to labor unions, had bestowed upon

810

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U. S.

such unions complete and unreviewable authority to aid
business groups to frustrate its primary objective. For
if business groups, by combining with labor unions, can
fix prices and divide up markets, it was little more than
a futile gesture for Congress to prohibit price fixing by
business groups themselves. Seldom, if ever, has it been
claimed before, that by permitting labor unions to carry
on their own activities, Congress intended completely to
abdicate its constitutional power to regulate interstate
commerce and to empower interested business groups to
shift our society from a competitive to a monopolistic
economy. Finding no purpose of Congress to immunize
labor unions who aid and abet manufacturers and traders
in violating the Sherman Act, we hold that the district
court correctly concluded that the respondents had violated the Act.
Our holding means that the same labor union activities
may or may not be in violation of the Sherman Act, dependent upon whether the union acts alone or in combination with business groups. This, it is argued, brings
about a wholly undesirable result-one which leaves labor
unions free to engage in conduct which restrains trade.
But the desirability of such an exemption of labor unions
is a question for the determination of Congress. Apex
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, supra. It is true that many labor
union activities do substantially interrupt the course of
trade and that these activities, lifted out of the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, include substantially all, if not
all, of the normal peaceful activities of labor unions. It is
also true that the Sherman Act "draws no distinction between the restraints effected by violence and those
achieved by peaceful . . .means," Apex Hosiery Co. v.
Leader,supra,513, and that a union's exemption from the
Sherman Act is not to be determined by a judicial "judgment regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or
wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of

ALLEN BRADLEY CO. v. UNION.
797

Opinion of the Court.

which the particular union activities are the means."
United States v. Hutcheson, supra, 232. Thus, these
congressionally permitted union activities may restrain
trade in and of themselves. There is no denying the
fact that many of them do so, both directly and
indirectly. Congress evidently concluded, however, that
the chief objective of Anti-trust legislation, preservation of business competition, could be accomplished by
applying the legislation primarily only to those business
groups which are directly interested in destroying com-'
petition. The difficulty of drawing legislation primarily
aimed at trusts and monopolies so that it could also be
applied to labor organizations without impairing the collective bargaining and related rights of those organizations has been emphasized both by congressional and
judicial attempts to draw lines between permissible and
prohibited union activities. There is, however, one line
which we can draw with assurance that we follow the
congressional purpose. We know that Congress feared
the concentrated power of business organizations to
dominate markets and prices. It intended to outlaw
business monopolies. A business monopoly is no less
such because a union participates, and such participation
is a violation of the Act.
This brings us to a consideration of the scope of the
declaratory judgment and the injunction granted by the
district court. We cannot sustain the judgment or the
injunction in the form in which they were entered.
The judgment and the injunction apply only to the
union, its members, and its agents, since they were the
only parties against whom relief was asked. The judgment declared that "the combination and conspiracy
and the acts done and being done in furtherance thereof
all as set forth in the findings of fact herein are unlawful and contrary to the . . . Sherman Anti-Trust Law,
as amended- and supplemented." There were 374 find-

812

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

325 U.S.

ings of fact which cover 111 pages of the printed record. These findings were made from 25,000 pages of
evidence. The declaratory judgment, which was the
foundation for the injunction, is thus almost the equivalent of a statement that each fact "as set forth in
the 374 findings" constituted a violation of the Sherman
Act. And when we turn to the sweeping commands of
the injunction, we find that its terms, directed against the
union and its agents alone, restrained the union, even
though not acting in concert with the manufacturers, from
doing the very things that the Clayton Act specifically
permits unions to do. We agree with the following
statement of the Circuit Court of Appeals:
"Indeed, the injunction is so far contrary to the statute
that its mandate might well have been stated in the converse of the terms of the Clayton Act, § 20, viz., as restraining Local 3 and its officers 'from terminating any
relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any
work or labor . . . or from ceasing to patronize

any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so
to do.' 29U. S. C. A., §52, supra. And the vague scope of
the declaratory judgment is even more indefinitely inclusive, in terms reaching all the activities of the defendant set
forth in the findings."
Respondents objected to the form of the injunction and
specifically requested that it be amended so as to enjoin
only those prohibited activities in which the union engaged in combination "with any person, firm or corporation which is a non-labor group

. . ."

Without such a

limitation, the injunction as issued runs directly counter

Reversed and remanded.
MR. Jus~icrc ROBERTS.

While I should reverse the judgment, I am unable to
concur in the court's opinion. I think it conveys an incorrect impression of the genesis and character of the conspiracy charged in the complaint, and misapplies recent
decisions of the court.
There is no doubt that the programme adopted by Local
No. 3 envisaged the exclusion, from the entire New York
City area, of any electrical workers, whether engaged in
manufacturing or installing electrical devices and equipment, except members of the Local. The organization
from time to time increased the classes of members, so as
to add to its original membership of workers engaged in
fabricating and installing electrical devices, equipment,
and apparatus the additional categories of shop employes
engaged in manufacturing electrical equipment and all
workers employed in alterations, additions, and repairs involving electrical equipment. It succeeded in unionizing
and imposing closed shops emiloying only members of
Local 3, not only on all buildi'ng contractors, but on
all repair contractors and their establishments and all
manufacturers of electrical equipment. Membership in
the union was closely restricted and the campaign eventuated in a situation where no electrical work could be done
by persons other than members of the union, no building
construction could be done by other than union men, no
matter what their trade, and no manufactured electrical
appliance or apparatus could be installed in the New York
area without the consent of Local No. 3. That consent
was given only if the device, appliance or apparatus was
manufactured, or work done on'it, by members of-the Local. Complicated apparatus: whichhad to be manufac-

tured outside New York City, because no establishment
making it existed within the city, had to be dismantled
and rebuilt by members of the Local before it could be
used in the New York area.
It is true that before Local No. 3 obtained this complete
control of the industry in its area of operation certain
associated building contractors dealt jointly as an association with the union. As respects certain manufacturers
which came under the dominance of the union this is not
true. Nor is it true of repair businesses. On the contrary, it is the fact that each one of these was individually
coerced by the union's power to agree to its terms. It is,
therefore, inaccurate to say that the employers used the
union to aid and abet them to restrain interstate commerce. .Some of the employers, notably the building contractors, did jointly coopdrate with the union; other sorts
of employers were forced individually to comply with the
union's demands, until all of them had succumbed.
There can be no question of the purpose of the union.
It was to exclude from use in the City of New York articles of commerce made outside the city and offered for
sale to users within the city; it was completely to monopolize the manufacture and sale of all electrical equipment
and devices within New York, and to exclude from use
in the area every such article manufactured outside- the
city, whether in a closed union shop 6r not. The results
of this programme are obvious. Interstate commerce
between New York City and manufacturers having establishments outside the city was completely broken off, and
the monopoly created raised, standardized and fixed the
prices of merchandise and apparatus.
As I understand the opinion of the court, such a programme, and such a result, is wholly within the law
provided only that employers do not jointly agree to
comply With the union's demands. Unless I misread the
opinion, the union is at liberty to impose every term and

condition as shown by the record in this case and to enforce
those conditions and procure an agreement from each
employer to such conditions by calling strikes, by lockout,
and boycott, provided only such employer agrees for
-himself alone and not in concert with any other.
I point out again, as respects certain employers here
concerned, that that is the situation, whereas, with respect
to the building construction employers, there was mutual
agreement with the union. But the opinion ,takes no note
of the distinction in fact. It seems to me that the' law as
announced by the court creates an .impossible situation
such as Congress never contemplated and leaves commerce
paralyzed beyond escape.
Until Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, was
decided I had thought that a conspiracy by laborers to
interrupt the free flow of commerce was a violation of the
Sherman Act. That case, however, announced a narrower
doctrine. Its teaching is that only activity of labor which
harms the commercial competitive system through raising
prices, restricting production, or otherwise controlling the
market, falls within the proscription of the Sherman Act.
In that case it was said:
"Furthermore, successful union activity, as for example
consummation of a wage agreement with employers, may
have some influence on price competition by eliminating
that part of such competition which is based on differences
in labor standards. Since, in order to render a labor combination effective it must eliminate the competition from
non-union made goods, see American Steel Foundries v.
Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184, 209, an
elimination of price competition based on differences in
labor standards is the objective of any national labor organization. But this effect on competition has not been
considered to be the kind of curtailment of price competition prohibited by the Sherman Act."

816

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of ROBERTS, J.

325 U. S.

It was added that the restraint there under examination
was not shown "to have any actual or intended effect on
price or price competition." The decision indicated that,
in some undefined circumstances, labor organizations
might be subject to the statute.
In United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, secondary
boycotts by labor unions to keep out of the market nonunion goods, or goods worked on by other unions, were held
immune from liability, civil or criminal, under. the
Sherman Act. It was there said:
"So long as a union acts in its self-interest and does not
combine with non-labor groups, the licit and the illicit
under § 20 are not to be distinguished by any judgment
regarding the wisdom or unwisdom, the rightness or wrongness, the selfishness or unselfishness of the end of which
the particular union activities are the means."
Thus, although a conspiracy between laborers is distinguished from one between them and employers, it is
intimated, as I think, that a purpose on the part of a labor
group to harm the commercial competitive system, to
raise prices, to restrict production, or otherwise control
the market, would not render the concerted action illegal,
provided only that no employer participated. The reservation made in the Apex case was discarded in the
Hutcheson case. This advance in the law was emphasized
in United States v. Building Trades Council, 313 U. S.539,
and UnitedStates v. Brotherhood of Carpenters,313 U. S.
539, but the court went even farther, in United States v.
Federation of Musicians, 318 U. S. 741, and, as I think,
rendered a decision contrary to that now announced.
There a motion to dismiss a bill of complaint was granted
and this court sustained that action. The complaint
charged a conspiracy by the American Federation of
Musicians, a nationwide organization, and its officers,
to obtain employment for its members by eliminating
entirely from interstate commcrce all phonograph records

ALLEN BRADLEY CO. v. UNION.

and electrical transcriptions
of music and eliminating all
J
competition between transcribed music and that produced
by living musicians. The conspiracy charged was absolutely to prevent manufacture or sale of phonograph records and electrical transcriptions; to eliminate from the
market all manufacturers, distributors, jobbers or retailers
of the same, and to prevent the use of the articles, either
in public places or private homes, and, of course, to prevent their sale. In the bill it was charged that the
conspiracy did not grow out of or involve any dispute
concerning terms or conditions of employment; that the
purpose of the conspiracy was to eliminate from the market, manufacture, sale and use of mechanical recordings
and records and transcriptions unless the persons engaged
in this business should enter into agreements with the
union, hiring useless and unnecessary labor, as the union
would demand. The further purpose of the conspiracy
charged was to exclude from the market competition by
anyone who failed exclusively to employ members of the
union. The complaint further charged that the purpose
and effect of the conspiracy was unlawfully to destroy all
manufacture and sale, in interstate commerce, of phonograph records and electrical transcriptions, eliminate all
competition between music produced by mechanical
means and music produced by living musicians, 'to deprive
the public of an inexpensive means of entertainment in
public places and in the home.
This court's affirmance of the dismissal of this complaint
can only mean that every businessman? who desires to
stay in business must, if a union so demands, enter into
an agreement with the union eliminating certain articles
fron his manufacture, from his sales, or from his use. The
decision must necessarily mean that it would not be unlawful to enter into such an agreement with the union,
otherwise we should have the anomaly that the union's
demand for such an agreement is impeccable but the em-

ployer's acquiescence is unlawful. As shown by the opinion of the District Court in that case (47 F. Supp. 304)
the Government contended that the union's effort represented "an attempt by the union to force employers to
combine with it for the purpose of restraining interstate
trade . . ." The District Court shortly answered this
contention (p. 309) by saying: "In the court's opinion,
United States v. Brims, 272 U. S. 549, . . . and like cases,
are not pertinent." This must mear that each employer,
in the instant case, is at liberty to agree with the union
on all the terms and conditions which create a complete
monopoly, a complete boycott, a complete closing of the
market, and a serious price fixing affecting competitive
commercial transactions. This is what I understand the
court now holds. This is what was accomplished with
impunity by the Federation of Musicians. But the
situation created by such a holding is unreal.
As I have pointed out, in two branches of the industry,
the manufacturers and employers, one by one, succumbed
to union pressure and entered into agreements. Was not
such an action, in each instance, a conspiracy? Are more
than two parties required to conspire, and did not each
of those conspiracies, to some extent, hinder and restrain
interstate commerce and affect the market and the competitive price situation? As each agreement was consummated the market was, to that extent, closed and the
boycott against out-of-the-city manufactures tightened.
But more. The union did not conduct its campaign
in a corner. Albeit the findings are that manufacturers
and repairers of electrical appliances violently resisted the
unionization of their businesses, they, one by one, surrendered and signed. In doing so, many must have had
knowledge of what others were doing or had done. And,
as the coverage became complete, each one was enabled to
stifle out-of-town competition and to raise prices. In any
action against them and the union charging conspiracy, it

Opinion of

ROBERTS,

J.

would be urged that a conspiracy need not consist of a
written or verbal agreement but might be inferred from
similarity of action. And it would be little protection to
the employers concerned that, in each instance, a separate
agreement was signed between union and employer.
The course of decision in this court has now created a
situation in which, by concerted action, unions may set
up a wall around a municipality of millions of inhabitants
against importation of any goods if the union is careful
to make separate contracts with each employer, and if
union and employers are able to convince the court that,
while all employers have such agreements, each acted
independently in making them,-this notwithstanding
the avowed purpose to exclude goods not made in that
city by the members of the union; notwithstanding the
fact that the purpose and inevitable result is the stifling
of competition in interstate trade and the creation of a
monopoly.
The only answer I find in the opinion of the court is
that Congress has so provided. I think it has not provided any such thing and that the figmentary difference
between employers negotiating jointly with the only union
with which they can deal,-which imposes like conditions
on all employers-and each employer dealing separately
with the same union is unrealistic and unworkable. And
'the language of § 20 of the Clayton Act makes no such
distinction.
This court, as a result of its past decisions, is in the
predicament that whatever it decides must entail disastrous results. I can understand that the Circuit Court
of Appeals felt constrained by the prior decisions of this
court to order the judgment of the District Court reversed
and the action dismissed. If the present decision is, as
I think, a retrogression from earlier holdings, I welcome
it; if it is but a limitation of them I concur in the partial

alleviation of An impossible situation. But I would not
limit the injunction as the opinion directs.
MR.JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting.

My disagreement with the Court rests not so much with
the legal principles announced as with the application of
those principles to the facts of the case.
If the union in this instance had acted alone in its selfinterest, resulting in a restraint of interstate trade, the
Sherman.-Act concededly would be inapplicable. But
if the union had aided and abetted manufacturers or
traders in: violating the Act, the union's statutory immunitywould disappear. I cannot agree, however, that the
circumstances of this case demand the invocation of the
latter rule.
The union here has not in any true sense "aided" or
"abetted" a primary violation of the Act by the employers.
In the words of the union, it has been "the dynamic force
which has driven the employer-group to enter into agreements" whereby trade has been affected. The fact that
the union has expressed its self-interest with the aid of
others rather than solely by its own activities should not
be decisive of statutory liability. What is legal if done
alone should not become illegal if done with the assistance
of others and with the same purpose in mind. Otherwise
a premium of unlawfulness is placed on collective
bargaining.
Had the employers embarked upon a course of unreasonable trade restraints and had they sought to immunize
themselves from the Sherman., Act by using the union as
a shield for their nefarious practices, we would have quite
a different case. The unioi then could not be said to be
acting in its self-interest in combining with the employers
to carry out trade restraints primarily for the employers'
interests, even though incidental benefits might accrue to
the union. Under such conditions the union fairly could

be said to be aiding and abetting a violation of the Act and
its immunity would be lost. The facts of this case,
however, do 'not allow such conclusions to be drawn.
I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court
below.

No. 570. Argued March 2, 1945.-Decided. June 18, 1945.
1. Refusal of a labor union to admit to membership the employees
of an interstate motor carrier, and refusal of members of the union
to accept employment by the carrier-even though as a result
it was impossible for the carrier to continue in business--held not
a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, as amended. P. 823.
2. That the refusal of members of the union to accept employment
by the carrier stemmed from personal antagonism toward a partner
in the carrier firm-arising out of the killing of a union man, of
which the partner was acquitted---did not render such refusal
a violation of the Sherman Act. P. 824.
3. The fact that the refusal of the union members to accept employment was related to the business of an interstate carrier did not
make such refusal a violation of the Sherman Act. P, 825.
4. A labor union's breach of duty to employees in a collective bargaining group is not, of itself, a violation of the Sherman Act.

5. The Sherman Act does not afford a remedy for every tort committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce.
