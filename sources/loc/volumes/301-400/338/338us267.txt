PER CURIAM.

The controversy here concerned the validity of Patent
No. 1,906,260, issued to respondent, May 2, 1933, and its
alleged infringement by petitioner. The District Court
found the patent to be valid and infringed. The Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 170 F. 2d 34
(1948). Being moved by the petition for certiorari that
there was a conflict with HalliburtonOil Well Cementing
Co. v. Walker, 329 U. S. 1 (1946), we granted certiorari.

After the suit in this cause was initiated in the District
Court, petitioner modified his device. The courts below
held that this modification was insubstantial and did not
place petitioner outside the scope of respondent's patent.
We will not disturb the concurrent findings upon the
issues presented to us in the petition for certiorari. We
are not persuaded that the findings are shown to be clearly
erroneous. The judgment is

of the claims was too
