CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.*

Argued October 19-20, 1949.-Decided December 12, 1949.
Notwithstanding R. S. § 3477, restricting assignments of claims
against the United States, an insurance company may bring an
action under the Federal Tort Claims Act in its own name against
the United States upon a claim to which it has become subrogated
by payment to an insured who would have been able to bring such
action. Pp. 367-383.
(a) R. S. § 3477 does not bar transfers by operation of law.

U. S. 392; Goodman v. Niblack, 102 U. S. 556. Pp. 370-376.
(b) It was the understanding of Congress when it passed the
Tort Claims Act that subrogation claims were not within the bar
of R. S. § 3477. Pp. 376-380.
(c) Under Rule 17 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
which were specifically made applicable to Tort Claims litigation,
an insurer-subrogee is a "real party in interest" and may sue in
its own name-even though it may be subrogated to only part of
a claim. Pp. 380-383.

Opinion of the Court.

In No. 36, the Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment
against the United States under the Tort Claims Act

negligence of a government employee. This Court
granted certiorari. 336 U. S. 960. Affirmed, p. 383.
In Nos. 37 and 38, a District Court dismissed complaints against the United States under the Tort Claims
Act brought by two insurers which had reimbursed an
insured for property damages resulting from negligence
of a government employee. The Court of Appeals reversed. 171 F. 2d 374. This Court granted certiorari.
336 U. S. 960. Affirmed, p. 383.
Leavenworth Colby argued the cause for the United
States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General
Perlman,Assistant Attorney General Morison, Samuel D.
Slade and Joseph Kovner.

These cases, here on certiorari, present this important
question under the Federal Tort Claims Act: ' May an
160 Stat. 842; formerly codified as 28 U. S. C. § 931 et seq. The
new Judicial Code became effective on Sept. 1, 1948, while these

insurance company bring suit in its own name against
the United States upon a claim to which it has become
subrogated by payment to an insured who would have
been able to bring such an action? That question, in
turn, requires our consideration of R. S. 3477, the "antiassignment" statute.2
Three cases, each presenting a slightly different aspect
of the problem, were heard by the Court. In No. 35, the
complaint alleges that an employee of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York was injured as a result of the negligence of a United States Post Office Department employee. Respondent insurance carrier had insured the
Federal Reserve Bank against its liability for workmen's
compensation, and duly paid the injured person's claim
under the New York Workmen's Compensation Law.
The complaint further alleges that the injured person
failed to commence any action against the United States
within one year after the accident, and that his inaction
operated, according to New York law,3 as an assignment
to the insurer of his cause of action against the United
States. The District Court dismissed the complaint, 76
F. Supp. 333, but the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed and remanded the cause for trial. 170
F. 2d 469.
In No. 36, the Government's motion to dismiss the
complaint was denied, and, after trial, it was found as fact
that an employee of the United States Forest Service had
negligently driven a Government vehicle into a vehicle
owned by one Harding, causing damages of $1,484.50;
2 10 Stat. 170 as amended; 31 U. S. C. § 203.
3 When this action was brought, § 29 of the New York Workmen's
Compensation Act provided that if an injured employee has taken
compensation but has failed to commence action against the tortfeasor
within one year after the cause of action accrued, "such failure
shall operate as an assignment of the cause of action against such
other . . . to the person, association, corporation, or insurance carrier
liable for the payment of such compensation."

Opinion of the Court.

that Harding was insured by the respondent insurance
carrier and, pursuant to the terms of the policy, had been
paid $784.50 by the insurer, to which it was now subrogated. Judgment was thereupon entered against the
United States in favor of Harding for $700.00 and in favor
of respondent insurance company for $784.50. The
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Nos. 37 and 38 present the situation in which two insurance companies, each of which has paid part of a claim
of loss occasioned by the negligence of an employee of the
United States, bring suits in their own names, each asking recovery of the amount it has paid to the assured.
The District Court dismissed the complaints on motion of
the Government, but the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed and remanded the causes. 171 F. 2d 374.
We granted certiorari in these cases, 336 U. S.960, because of a conflict of decisions in the circuits ' and the
manifest importance of the question.
The Federal Tort Claims Act provides in pertinent part
that

conclusion, United States v. Hill, 171 F. 2d 404, Judge Hutcheson
dissenting. Reargument was ordered before the full bench and, upon
reconsideration, the original opinion was modified, 174 F. 2d 61,
Judge Hutcheson concurring in the result "as in substantial accordance with the views the dissent expressed."

omission complained of occurred, . . . sitting without a jury, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear,
determine, and render judgment on any claim against
the United States, for money only, . . . on account
of damage to or loss of property or on account of
personal injury or death caused by the negligent or
wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office
or employment, under circumstances where the
United States, if a private person, would be liable
to the claimant for such damage, loss, injury, or
death in accordance with the law of the place where
the act or omission occurred. Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the United States shall be
liable in respect of such claims to the same claimants,
in the same manner, and to the same extent as a
private individual under like circumstances . . . ."
While the language of the Act indicates a congressional
purpose that the United States be treated as if it were a
private person in respect of torts committed by its employees, except for certain specific exceptions enumerated
in the Act,' neither the terms of the Act nor its legislative
history precludes the application of R. S. 3477 in this
situation.
It is the Government's position that R. S. 3477, which
in terms makes "All transfers and assignments . . . of
any claim upon the United States, or of any part or share
thereof, or interest therein . . . absolutely null and
void . . ." except for assignments made after payment of
the claim and in accordance with certain prescribed safeguards, includes assignments by operation of law and prohibits suit by the subrogee in its own name. Petitioner

reads R. S. 3477 not as prohibiting transfer of a claimant's
substantive rights to an insurer-subrogee and ultimate
recovery by the insurer but as a procedural requirement
that the insurance carrier sue and recover judgment in
the name of the original claimant. United States v.
American Tobacco Co., 166 U. S. 468 (1897). Its purpose
in invoking the anti-assignment statute is said to be
two-fold: "(1) to insure that the United States may
avoid involvement in any litigation as to the existence or extent of subrogation or other assignment of such
claims; and (2) to insure that the suits and any judgments against the United States will be in the names of
the original claimants so that the United States will be
able to avail itself of its statutory rights in respect of
venue, and of counterclaim and offset on account of any
cross-claims it may have against the original claimants."
It is pointed out that "the provisions of the statute making void an assignment or power of attorney by a Government contractor are for the protection of the Government.
Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U. S. 567, 576; McGowan v. Parish, 237 U. S. 285, 294, 295. In the absence of such a rule,
the Government would be in danger of becoming embroiled in conflicting claims, with delay and embarrassment and the chance of multiple liability." Martin v.
National Surety Co., 300 U. S. 588, 594 (1937). The
Government contends that the inconvenience, administrative and accounting difficulties, and procedural problems
which, it is apprehended, may involve the Government if
subrogees are permitted to bring suits under the Tort
Claims Act in their own names make this an apt situation
for application of R. S. 3477, and that that was the congressional intent.
It should be noted at the outset, however, that in the
courts below and until argument in this Court (and even
in its petition for certiorari) the Government contended
that R. S. 3477 was a complete bar to recovery by a

subrogee. Only in brief and argument here was it suggested that the insurance carrier couid recover if suit
was brought in the name of the insured to the use of
the insurer, citing for the first time United States v.
American Tobacco Co., supra, a decision reflecting common-law procedure, upon which reliance is now placed.7
It is for that reason that the opinions below were focused
upon whether R. S. 3477 is an absolute bar to recovery
by the subrogee rather than merely a bar to recovery in
the name of the subrogee. We think, however, that even
this limited, and somewhat anomalous,8 reliance upon
R. S. 3477 is untenable, first, because of the uniform interpretation given that statute by this Court for the past
75 years, and, second, because of many affirmative indications of congressional intent that subrogation claims
should not be excluded from suit in the name of the subrogee under the Tort Claims Act.
This contention was also made in reargument of United States v.
Hill, before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which took
place after certiorari was granted by this Court. See note 4.
8 Petitioner's argument is, in effect, that R. S. 3477 does not prevent the assignment of substantive rights against the United States
but merely controls the method of procedure by which the assignee
may recover. This position is in square conflict with Spofiord v.
Kirk, 97 U. S. 484, and is not justified by anything said in Martin v.
National Surety Co., 300 U. S. 588. Furthermore, it would require
that the real party in interest provisions of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, Rule 17 (a), be disregarded, despite the fact that they
are made specifically applicable to suits under the Tort Claims Act,
and that suits against the Government in which a subrogee owns the
substantive right be conducted according to the old common-law procedures in effect prior to the promulgation of the Federal Rules.
Petitioner admits as much by its reliance upon United States v.
American Tobacco Co., 166 U. S. 468. This is not to say that R. S.
3477 was "repealed" by the Federal Rules, but that a new interpretation of the statute which is incompatible with the Rules, as
expressly incorporated in the Tort Claims Act, must be clearly
justified.

UNITED STATES v. AETNA SURETY CO. 373
366

Opinion of the Court.

R. S. 3477 was enacted in 1853 as part of a statute
entitled "An Act to prevent Frauds upon the Treasury
of the United States."'
Its primary purpose was undoubtedly to prevent persons of influence from buying
up claims against the United States, which might then
be improperly urged upon officers of the Government.0
Spofford v. Kirk, 97 U. S.484, 490 (1878). Another purpose, that upon which the Government now relies, has
been inferred by this Court from the language of the statute. That purpose was to prevent possible multiple payment of claims, to make unnecessary the investigation of
alleged assignments, and to enable the Government to deal
only with the original claimant. Spofford v. Kirk, supra;
Goodman v. Niblack, 102 U. S.556, 560 (1881). Most of
the early cases construed the statute strictly, holding that
all assignments were included within the statute and that
such assignments conferred no rights of any kind upon
the assignee; that R. S.3477 "incapacitates every claimant upon the government from creating an interest in
the claim in any other than himself." Spofiord v. Kirk,
supra, pp. 488-89. See also National Bank of Commerce
v. Downie, 218 U. S.345 (1910); Nutt v. Knut, 200 U. S.
12 (1906); St. Paul & Duluth R. Co. v. United States, 112
U. S.733 (1885).
The rigor of this rule was very early relaxed in cases
which were thought not to be productive of the evils
which the statute was designed to obviate. And one of
the first such exceptions was to transfers by operation
of law. In United States v. Gillis, 95 U. S.407 (1877), the
Court held that a provision in the Act creating the Court
9 10 Stat. 170.
10Other sections of the Act made it unlawful for officers of the
United States or Members of Congress to have any interest in
claims against the Government or to act for claimants, penalized
bribery or undue influencing of Members of Congress, and prohibited
the destruction or withdrawal of public records.

Opinion of the Court.

338 U. S.

of Claims that suits on assignments may be brought in
the name of the assignee did not mean that R. S. 3477
was inapplicable to suits in the Court of Claims, but
referred to claims which were excepted from the prohibition of that statute, such as "devolutions of title by
force of law, without any act of parties, or involuntary
assignments, compelled by law." During the following
term a case was presented in which an assignee in bankruptcy had sued the United States on a claim of the
bankrupt. This Court held the suit maintainable despite R. S. 3477, on the ground that
"The act of Congress of Feb. 26, 1853, to prevent
frauds upon the treasury of the United States, which
was the subject of consideration in the Gillis Case,
applies only to cases of voluntary assignment of demands against the government. It does not embrace
cases where there has been a transfer of title by
operation of law. The passing of claims to heirs,
devisees, or assignees in bankruptcy are not within
the evil at which the statute aimed; nor does the
construction given by this court deny to such parties
a standing in the Court of Claims." Erwin v. United
States, 97 U. S. 392, 397 (1878).
This construction of R. S. 3477-that assignments by
operation of law are not within the prohibition of the
statute-was recognized as settled law in Goodman v.
Niblack, supra, and has been repeated with approval in
a great many subsequent cases."
The Government now contends, contrary to the statements in all of the cases approving Erwin v. UnitedStates,
1 See, e. g., St. Paul & Duluth R. Co. v. United States, 112 U. S.
733, 736; Butler v. Goreley, 146 U. S. 303, 311; Hager v. Swayne,
149 U. S. 242; Ball v. Halsell, 161 U. S. 72, 79; Price v. Forrest,
173 U. S. 410, 421; National Bank of Commerce v. Downie, 218
U. S. 345, 356; Western Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 268 U. S. 271,
275.

Opinion of the Court.

supra, that an assignment by operation of law is not always exempt from the bar of R. S. 3477, but that in
addition the assignment must be of a kind that will not
involve the Government in the procedural difficulties previously referred to. All of the cases in which R. S.
3477 has been held inapplicable on the ground of assignment by operation of law are explained as presenting
situations in which the Government could suffer no such
procedural embarrassments. In cases of transfer by descent (Erwin v. United States, supra), consolidation of
corporations (SeaboardAir Line R. Co. v. United States,
256 U. S. 655 (1921)), and purchase at a judicial sale in
a corporate reorganization (Western Pacific R. Co. v.
United States, 268 U. S. 271 (1925)) it is pointed out
that the Government may deal with the substituted representative as it would have dealt with the claimant if
there had been no substitution. Rights of counterclaim
and set-off are said to be retained against the universal
successor, while such universal assignments by operation
of law can give rise to no controversies as to the existence
and extent of the transfer for adjudication between the
United States and the original claimant and his trustee,
receiver, or administrator.
Without considering whether some of the cases are not
comprehended within this rationale, 2 we do not think
that it explains the exception made for transfers by operation of law in the cases referred to. In the first place, the
Court has always stated the flat exception of all transfers
by operation of law, as distinguished from voluntary
transfers. If the cases rest upon the premise advanced
by the Government, it has never been articulated in
the opinions. In the second place, and consistent with
For example, transfers by will or intestacy, which are not within
the prohibition of R. S. 3477 under the cases, would obviously multiply the persons with whom the United States must deal and might
very well embroil it in conflicting claims.

the exception of all transfers by operation of law, this
Court has a number of times indicated that neither of
the purposes of R. S. 3477 is contravened by transfers by
operation of law. In Goodman v. Niblack, supra, it was
held that:
"The language of the statute, 'all transfers and assignments of any claim upon the United States, or
of any part thereof, or any interest therein,' is broad
enough (if such were the purpose of Congress) to
include transfers by operation of law, or by will.
Yet we held it did not include a transfer by operation
of law, or in bankruptcy, and we said it did not
include one by will. The obvious reason of this
is that there can be no purpose in such cases to harass
the government by multiplying the number of persons with whom it has to deal, nor any danger of
enlisting improper influences in advocacy of the
claim, and that the exigencies of the party who held
it justified and required the transfer that was made."
(102 U. S. at 560; italics added.) See also Hager
v. Swayne, 149 U. S. 242, 247-48 (1893).
The fact that some administrative problems may be the
unintended by-products of an involuntary assignment was
not thought to be an evil within the scope of a statute
aimed at fraud and harassment. That interpretation has,
for nearly a century, exempted all transfers by operation
of law from the prohibition of R. S.3477.
That it was the understanding of Congress that subrogation claims were not within the bar of R. S.3477 when
it passed the Tort Claims Act is abundantly clear from a
number of different particulars:
1. The Small Tort Claims Act of 1922 13 provided that
heads of departments may "consider, ascertain, adjust,
and determine any claim . . . on account of damages to
1342 Stat. 1066, 31 U. S. C. § 215.

Opinion of the Court.

or loss of privately owned property where the amount of
the claim does not exceed $1,000, caused by the negligence
of any officer or employee of the Government acting
within the scope of his employment." Such claims as
were found due were certified to Congress for payment.
A question was directed to the Attorney General in 1932
as to "whether such a claim, which if made by the owner
of the property damaged could have been certified, may
properly be certified if made by an insurance company
which has become subrogated to the rights of the owner
to receive compensation for the damage suffered." Attorney General Mitchell's opinion "' was: (1) that subrogation is a transfer by operation of law of the right, to
receive payment of the amount due; and (2) that R. S.
3477 applies only to cases of voluntary assignment of demands against the Government. He thought, however,
that inasmuch as the question was one concerning the
purpose and intent of Congress in enacting the Small Tort
Claims Act, that body should be asked to interpret the
statute by passing upon subrogation claims certified to it
and expressly called to its attention. Thereafter subrogation claims in the names of insurance carriers were regularly submitted to Congress and were consistently approved until the Act was repealed by the present Tort
Claims Act. The Attorney General's opinion was approved and congressional acquiescence noted by the
Comptroller General in opinions in 19 Comp. Gen. 503,
21 Comp. Gen. 341, and 22 Comp. Gen. 611. A unique
interpretation by Congress of its own statute thus settled the question whether R. S.3477 was a bar to subrogation claims under the Small Tort Claims Act, which,
in language nearly identical with that of the present Tort

Claims Act, permitted recovery "on account of damages
to or loss of privately owned property . .. .
2. That specific reference in the statute was necessary
to preclude recovery by subrogees in their own names
(i. e., that R. S. 3477 is inapplicable to subrogees) was
clearly the view of Congress when it enacted the Tort
Claims Act. For in foreign claims legislation where it
intended that result, Congress explicitly provided that
Claims Officers should consider, ascertain, determine, and
pay claims on account of injury or death, or property loss
or damage to claimants in foreign countries, "including
claims of insured but excluding claims of subrogees." 1'
The purpose of this provision, which was enacted in 1943,
was to fulfill the very office which petitioner now contends is performed by R. S. 3477.1' No such exception
is found in the Tort Claims Act, although other exceptions are spelled out with great particularity. The significance of this provision in the foreign claims statute is,
first, that when Congress wished to exclude claims by
subrogees it said so; and second, that Congress did not
think R. S. 3477 performed that function. For a similar
provision, see 49 Stat. 2194.7
15 57 Stat. 66, 31 U. S. C. § 224d.
The House Committee Report states that "Such a provision of

16

law leaves undisturbed, as between the parties, the rights of the
insured and of insurance companies and others who have become
subrogated to the rights of the owners of the property or of the
person who is injured or whose death results, but permits the Government to settle with a single claimant and without the necessity
of inquiry into, or determination of, the relative rights of the parties."
H. R. Rep. No. 312, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2.
17 That members of the House Committee on Claims were aware
of the problem of recovery by insurance carrier-subrogees at the
time the Tort Claims Act was passed is demonstrated by that Committee's report, submitted less than two weeks prior to passage of
the Act, on subrogation claims presented by insurance companies
in connection with the crash of an army airplane into the Empire

3. Nor did executive departments themselves interpret
R. S. 3477 as applicable to subrogation claims, as the
report of the hearings on H. R. 6442, 77th Cong., 2d
Sess. (1942) makes plain. That bill, which was drafted
by the Treasury Department, would have required subrogees to institute actions against their subrogors in some
court of competent jurisdiction, which would then restrain the original claimant from receiving any funds
from the Government until final decision was reached
as to who was to receive the money. The Assistant General Counsel of the Treasury, in explaining the bill, stated:
"In 1877 the Supreme Court, in the case of U. S.
v. Gillis (95 U. S. 407), after stating in effect that
State Building. The War Department had recommended to Congress that Empire State, Inc., and other private claimants be paid
their uninsured losses (which was done) but refused to recommend
payment of insured losses. H. R. 6683 was introduced "to appropriate the sum of $143,279.94 to 22 fire-insurance companies in full satisfaction of their subrogation claims against the United States . ...
The Committee made specific reference to Attorney General Mitchell's
opinion, noted that since that time the War Department had paid
subrogation claims of less than $1,000 under the Military Claims
Act, 31 U. S. C. § 223, and disapproved that department's refusal
to certify claims of over $1,000. To the assertion that Congress
had consistently refused to recognize subrogation claims as barred
by R. S.3477, the Committee report contains the flat denial: "That
statement is not in accordance with the fact" and cites a number
of subrogation claims favorably acted upon by Congress. The bill
was favorably reported, H. R. Rep. No. 2655, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.,
but nine days later the Tort Claims Act was passed, § 131 of which
provided that no private bill should authorize payment of money for
claims for which suit might be brought under that Act, extending
retroactively to claims accruing after January 1, 1945. Since the
claims involved had accrued subsequent to that date, the insurance
company subrogees brought suit in a federal district court, where
the Government once more interposed a defense based on R. S.
3477, despite the Committee's specific approval of payment directly
to the subrogees. The defense was rejected. NiagaraFire Ins. Co. v.

section 3477 was of universal application and covered all claims against the United States in every
tribunal in which they might be asserted, indicated
in language not necessary to the decision that transfers or assignments compelled by law or resulting
from the operation of law might not have been
within the purview of section 3477.
"Now from that time on one exception after another has been carved from section 3477, until now
the courts recognize many types of adverse claims
as the basis for what in effect are third-party suits
against the Government, including suits based upon
assignments by operation of law, subrogation, and
equitable liens." Hearings before Subcommittee No.
3 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, on H. R.
6442, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942), at p. 3.
It cannot therefore be seriously contended that Congress and the executive departments were not cognizant
of the exemption of subrogation claims from R. S. 3477
when the Tort Claims Act was passed. The broad sweep
of its language assuming the liability of a private person,
the purpose of Congress to relieve itself of consideration
of private claims, and the fact that subrogation claims
made up a substantial part of that burden are also persuasive that Congress did not intend that such claims
should be barred.
If, then, R. S. 3477 is inapplicable, the Government
must defend suits by subrogees as if it were a private
person. Rule 17 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which were specifically made applicable to Tort
Claims litigation, 8 provides that "Every action shall be
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest," and
of course an insurer-subrogee, who has substantive equitable rights, qualifies as such. If the subrogee has paid

an entire loss suffered by the insured, it is the only real
party in interest and must sue in its own name. 3 Moore,
Federal Practice (2d ed.) p. 1339. If it has paid only part
of the loss, both the insured and insurer (and other insurers, if any, who have also paid portions of the loss)
have substantive rights against the tortfeasor which
qualify them as real parties in interest.
In cases of partial subrogation the question arises
whether suit may be brought by the insurer alone, whether
suit must be brought in the name of the insured for his
own use and for the use of the insurance company, or
whether all parties in interest must join in the action.
Under the common-law practice rights acquired by subrogation could be enforced in an action at law only in the
name of the insured to the insurer's use, Hall & Long v.
Railroad Companies, 13 Wall. 367 (1872); United States
v. American Tobacco Co., supra, as was also true of suits
on assignments, Glenn v. Marbury, 145 U. S. 499 (1892).
Mr. Justice Stone characterized this rule as "a vestige of
the common law's reluctance to admit that a chose in
action may be assigned, [which] is today but a formality
which has been widely abolished by legislation." Aetna
Life Ins. Co. v. Moses, 287 U. S. 530, 540 (1933). Under
the Federal Rules, the "use" practice is obviously unnecessary, as has long been true in equity, Garrisonv. Memphis Insurance Co., 19 How. 312 (1857), and admiralty,
Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance
Co., 129 U. S. 397, 462 (1889). Rule 17 (a) was taken
almost verbatim from Equity Rule 37. No reason appears why such a practice should now be required in cases
of partial subrogation, since both insured and insurer
''own" portions of the substantive right and should appear
in the litigation in their own names.
Although either party may sue, the United States,
upon timely motion, may compel their joinder. Delaware

(1890) (applying a state code under the Conformity Act).
3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed.) p. 1348. Both are
"necessary" parties. Rule 19 (b), Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.' 9 The pleadings should be made to reveal and
assert the actual interest of the plaintiff, and to indicate
the interests of any others in the claim. Additional
parties may be added at any stage of the proceedings,
on motion of the United States, upon such terms as may
be just. Rule 21.
It is true that under this rationale, there will be cases
in which all parties cannot be joined because one or more
are outside the jurisdiction, and the court may nevertheless proceed in the action under Rule 19 (b). In such
cases the United States, like other tortfeasors, may have
to defend two or more actions on the same tort and may
be unable to assert counterclaims and offsets against the
original claimant upon unrelated transactions."
19 They are clearly not "indispensable" parties under the familiar
test of Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 139 (1855), that such parties
have "an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made
without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in
such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent
with equity and good conscience." See Delaware County v. Diebold
Safe & Lock Co., 133 U. S. 473, 488 (1890); Hubbard v. Manhattan
Trust Co., 87 F. 51; Rogers v. Penobscot Mining Co., 154 F. 606;
3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed.) p. 2178.
20 The counterclaim statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (c),
confers jurisdiction on district courts over any "counterclaim, or other claim or
demand whatever on the part of the United States against any
plaintiff commencing an action." The offset statute, 31 U. S. C.
§§ 71, 227, directs the deduction from judgments and allowed claims
against the United States of debts as to which "the plaintiff therein
shall be indebted to the United States." (Italics added.) We need
not and do not consider what rights of counterclaim and set-off may
lie in the United States in suits brought by insurer-subrogees. Cf.
United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U. S. 234 (1947); Defense
Supplies Corp. v. United States Lines Co., 148 F. 2d 311.

Opinion of the Court.

If R. S. 3477 is inapplicable, as we think is clearly the
case, these objections have no legal foundation upon which
to rest. In argument before a number of District Courts
and Courts of Appeals, the Government relied upon the
doctrine that statutes waiving sovereign immunity must
be strictly construed. We think that the congressional
attitude in passing the Tort Claims Act is more accurately reflected by Judge Cardozo's statement in Anderson v. Hayes Construction Co., 243 N. Y. 140, 147, 153
N. E. 28, 29-30: "The exemption of the sovereign from
suit involves hardship enough where consent has been
withheld. We are not to add to its rigor by refinement
of construction where consent has been announced."
The decision of the Court of Appeals in each of these
cases is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK dissents.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
