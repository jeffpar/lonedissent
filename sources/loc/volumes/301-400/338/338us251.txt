delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin, arising from an order of the County Court
of Milwaukee County, levying certain death taxes on
the estate of Fred A. Miller, deceased, under the applicable statutes of Wisconsin. The question for decision
is the validity of the Wisconsin emergency tax on inheritances, Wis. Stat. (1947) § 72.74 (2), when tested in the
light of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
The decedent died testate on December 19, 1943, a resident of Wisconsin. At death his gross estate was
$7,849,714.84. Property located in Wisconsin was valued at $6,869,778.61; the remainder of $979,936.23 consisted of real and tangible personal property situated in
the States of Illinois and Florida.'
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed net
federal taxes against the estate in the sum of $3,076,131.19,
inclusive of the 80% of the basic federal tax subject to
credit for state estate taxes as provided by § 301 (b) of
the United States Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 70, as
amended, 26 U. S. C. § 813 (b). This 80% credit was the
sum of $630,709.62.
1The record does not reveal the exact nature of the property, and
we have held that whether the property is "tangible" within the
meaning of Frick v. Pennsylvania, 268 U. S. 473 (1925), infra, is a
federal question. Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1 (1928). In
this case, however, the parties and the court below agree that the
property is clearly "tangible" within the Frick rule. We accept
that assumption.

TREICHLER v. WISCONSIN.
251

Opinion of the Court.

Wisconsin has a triad of death taxes known as (1)
normal inheritance tax, (2) estate tax, and (3) emergency
tax.
The normal Wisconsin inheritance tax, as levied by
Wis. Stat. (1947) §§ 72.01 to 72.24, was in this case
$220,682.12. It is levied only on property within the
State of Wisconsin and is not in controversy here.
To take advantage of the credit provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, the Wisconsin legislature also enacted
an estate tax in the amount of 80% of the basic federal
tax subject to credit, less "the aggregate amount of all
estates, inheritance, transfer, legacy and succession taxes
paid to any state or territory or the District of Columbia,
in respect to any property in the estate of said decedent."
Wis. Stat. (1947) § 72.50. Wisconsin normal inheritance
taxes as well as out-of-state taxes are deducted from the
federal credit. The estate tax on this estate was computed at $352,701.79. However, this provision of the
Wisconsin statutes is not under explicit attack here.
The only statute, the validity of which is involved in
this appeal, is § 72.74 (2) of the Wisconsin statutes known
as the Emergency Tax on Inheritances. The section
under scrutiny provides:
"In addition to the taxes imposed by sections
72.01 to 72.24 and 72.50 to 72.61, an emergency tax
for relief purposes, rehabilitation of returning veterans of World War II, construction and improvements at state institutions and other state property
and for post-war public works projects to relieve
post-war unemployment is hereby imposed upon
all transfers of property which are taxable under
the provisions of said sections and which are made
subsequent to March 27, 1935 and prior to July 1,
1949 which said tax shall be equal to 30 per cent
of the tax imposed by said sections."

Opinion of the Court.

338 U. S.

As is apparent, computation of the additional emergency tax involves only four factors: (1) the amount
of the 80% federal credit, (2) the taxes paid to other
jurisdictions, (3) Wisconsin normal inheritance taxes,
and (4) the 30% rate imposed. In applying the yardstick of this section to the decedent's estate, the Wisconsin authorities took the total of the 80% federal credit,
that is $630,709.62, and first deducted from it the taxes
paid to states other than Wisconsin-Illinois ($35,616.26)
and Florida ($21,709.45)-and Wisconsin's normal inheritance tax ($220,682.12), which left $352,701.79. The
tax due was then calculated by taking 30% of the latter
amount, plus 30% of the normal inheritance tax. The
result, $172,015.20, was levied as the emergency inheritance tax due.
It will be seen that as the taxing formula is reduced, the
normal inheritance tax is no longer a factor in the computation. For while 30% thereof is added to 30% of
the estate tax to give the emergency tax, the normal
inheritance tax has already been subtracted in the computation of the basic estate tax. Hence, in extending the
formula of the emergency tax, the inheritance taxes
cancel.' What is left, other than out-of-state taxes, is
simply 80% of the basic federal tax, rated and measured
by the entire estate, regardless of situs, and therefore including the property located in Illinois and Florida.
The court below thought that the presence of 87.52%
of Mr. Miller's property within Wisconsin justified its
statement that the state taxed only Wisconsin property.
And the state argues that the "other 20%" over the federal basic estate tax 80% credit "more than absorbs, or
is, on any mathematical basis, attributable to" the 12.48%
of property outside Wisconsin. But Wisconsin made but
The formula is as follows:
30% XWisconsin normal inheritance tax+30% (80% federal basic
tax-Wisconsin normal inheritance tax-taxes paid in Illinois and

Opinion of the Court.

80% of the federal tax its own; and as it did not apportion
that 80% to property within the state, the presence of
property therein is simply a fortuity which cannot help
the taxing jurisdiction. See Owensboro National Bank
v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 683 (1899). The same must
be said of deductions for out-of-state taxes, which have
no necessary relation to the proportion of property outside
Wisconsin.'
Florida). This reduces to: 30% (80% federal basic tax-taxes paid
in Illinois and Florida).
Deductions authorized in the computation of the normal inheritance tax are thus of no significance.
The State's table of computation reads:

3 A different question might be presented, however, if the statute
in question authorized computation to begin with 87.52% rather than
all of the 80% federal credit. We intend to intimate no opinion as to
that situation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1949.
Opinion of the Court.

338 U. S.

We think it clear that the order entered by the Supreme
Court of Wisconsin authorized a tax on property rated
and measured in part by tangible property, the situs of
which was outside Wisconsin.
This Wisconsin may not do. In Frick v. Pennsylvania,
268 U. S. 473 (1925), Pennsylvania levied an inheritance
tax based upon real and personal property wherever located. Mr. Frick's art collection was located in New
York. In a unanimous opinion this Court ruled that
Pennsylvania's statute, "in so far as it attempts to tax
the transfer of tangible personalty having an actual situs
in other States, contravenes the due process of law
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is invalid."
Wisconsin's statute may be more sophisticated than
Pennsylvania's, but in terms of ultimate consequences this
case and the Frick case are one. It is quite unnecessary
to know in either case what property is located within
the taxing jurisdiction in order to compute the challenged
exaction.
Nor are we inclined to discard the Frick rule. We have
consistently upheld the domicile's levy when it was based
upon intangible property with technical title without the
jurisdiction. Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1 (1928).
And the economic effects of tax burdens in the federal
system cannot control our results, limited as we are to
the words of the Fourteenth Amendment. State Tax
Commission of Utah v. Aldrich, 316 U. S. 174, 181 (1942),
citing Holmes, J., dissenting in Baldwin v. Missouri, 281
U. S. 586, 595 (1930). But when a state reaches beyond
its borders and fastens upon tangible property, it confers
nothing in return for its exaction. Since the state of
location has all but complete dominion over the physical
objects sought to be measured for tax, see Green v. Van
Buskirk, 7 Wall. 139, 150 (1869); Curry v. McCanless,
307 U. S. 357, 363 (1939), and cases cited, no other state
can offer a quid pro quo. A state is not equipped with

Opinion of the Court.

the implements of power and diplomacy without its
boundaries which are at the root of the Federal Government's undoubted right to measure its tax upon foreign
property. United States v. Bennett, 232 U. S. 299
(1914); see Burnet v. Brooks, 288 U. S. 378 (1933). And
if the state has afforded nothing for which it can ask
return, its taxing statute offends against that due process
of law it is our duty to enforce.'
We hold that Wisconsin's emergency inheritance tax
is invalid insofar as it is measured by tangible property
outside Wisconsin. The judgment must be reversed and
the cause remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK dissents. He agrees that the
Court's holding logically follows from its interpretation
of the due process clause in the Frick case, but believes
that so interpreted the clause gives a more expansive
control over state tax legislation than the due process
clause justifies.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took

no part in the consideration

or decision of this case.

when so to do would have placed a premium upon the avoidance
of all state taxes. New York ex rel. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v.
Miller, 202 U. S. 584, 597 (1906); Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky,
