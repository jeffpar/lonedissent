dissenting.
I dissent from the dismissal of this appeal as moot for
the reasons stated in my dissent in Jacobs v. New York,
ante, p. 431. In my view, the question presented by this
case is extremely important and requires a decision on
the merits by this Court. I would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN,

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents. (See dissent set forth
in Jacobs v. New York, ante, at 436.)
