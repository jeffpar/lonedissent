APPEAL

ET AL.

FROM

v. ADAMS, SECRETARY OF STATE
OF FLORIDA, ET AL.

THE

UNITED

STATES

DISTRICT

COURT

FOR

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA.

No. 973.

Decided February 25, 1966.

This reapportionment case, instituted in 1962, was remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings in light of Reytiolds v.
Sims, 377 U. S. 533, and companion cases. The Florida Legislature on June 29, 1965, enacted a reapportionment plan, which the
District Court on appellants' challenge, filed July 6, held unconstitutional on December 23. That court, however, gave the plan
interim approval. The period for which such approval was given
would delay valid apportionment in Florida until at least 1969.
HfId: There is no warrant for perpetuating the unconstitutional
apportionment for three more years. The case is reversed and
remanded to the District Court so that a valid reapportionment
plan will be made effective for the 1966 elections.
Reversed and remanded.

D. P. S. Paul, P. D. Thomson, Neal Rutledge, Richard
F. Wolfson, Thomas C. Britton and Stuart Simon for
appellants.
Earl Faircloth, Attorney General of Florida, and
Edward D. Cowart and Sam Spector, Assistant Attorneys

General, for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

We previously remanded this case to the District Court
for further proceedings in light of Reynolds v. Sims, 377
U. S. 533, and the other cases relating to legislative
reapportionment decided with Reynolds. 378 U. S. 553.
The District Court deferred action until the conclusion
of the legislative; session which convened on April 6,

1965, stating that it would reconsider its decision should
the Florida Legislature fail to effect a valid reapportionment by July 1, 1965.
A reapportionment law was passed by the legislature
on June 29, 1965. On July 6 the appellants filed a joint
petition asking the District Court to declare the newly
enacted plan unconstitutional and proposing an alternative plan. The District Court did not take action until
October 5 when it ordered oral argument for November 2,
1965. On December 23 the District Court concluded
that the newly passed reapportionment plan failed to
"meet the requirements of the Equal Protection
Clause
of the Federal Constitution as construed and applied in
Reynolds v. Sims ... .
Although the District Court concluded that the plan
did not comport with constitutional requirements, it
approved the plan (making only minor changes) on an
interim basis. Its approval was limited to the period
ending 60 days after the adjournment of the 1967 session
of the Florida Legislature.
We have no occasion to review the District Court's
determination that the legislative reapportionment plan
fails to meet constitutional standards. Indeed, Florida
does not contend that the District Court erred in this
regard, having conceded below that the plan was constitutionally deficient. We hold, however, that in approving the plan on an interim basis, the District Court erred.
This litigation was commenced in 1962. The effect of
the District Court's decision is to delay effectuation of a
valid apportionment in Florida until at least 1969. While
recognizing the desirability of permitting the Florida
Legislature itself to determine the course of reapportionment, we find no warrant for perpetuating what all con-

cede to be an unconstitutional apportionment for another
three years.
We reverse and remand to the District Court so that
a valid reapportionment plan will be made effective for
the 1966 elections.
Reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART would

affirm the judgment.
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration

or decision of this case.
