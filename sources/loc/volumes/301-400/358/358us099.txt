HOTEL EMPLOYEES v. LEEDOM.
358 U. S.

Per Curiam.

HOTEL EMPLOYEES LOCAL NO. 255, HOTEL
AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AND BARTENDERS INTERNATIONAL UNION, ET AL. V.
LEEDOM, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.

No. 21.

Argued November 10, 1958.-Decided November 24, 1958.

Dismissal by the National Labor Relations Board of petitioners'
representation petition, on'the sole ground of the Board's longestablished policy of not asserting jurisdiction over the hotel
industry as a class, was beyond the Board's power.
101 U. S. App. D. C. 414, 249 F. 2d 506, reversed and case remanded.

J. W. Brown argued the cause for petitioners. With
him on the brief were Ben Gettler and Jonas B. Katz.
Dominick L. Manoli argued the cause for respondents.
With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin,
Jerome D. Fenton and Thomas J. McDermott.
Thomas F. Daly and Charles W. Merritt filed a brief
for the American Hotel Association, as amicus curiae,
urging affirmance.
PER CURIAM.

We believe that dismissal of the representation petition on the sole ground of the Board's "long standing
policy not to exercise jurisdiction over the hotel industry"
as a class, is contrary to the principles expressed in Office
Employes v. Labor Board, 353 U. S. 313, 318-320 (1957).
The judgment is therefore reversed and the case remanded
to the Court of Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent
herewith.
