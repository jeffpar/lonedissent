OCTOBER TERM, 1958.
Per Curiam.

358 U. S.

the defendant . . .is so against the weight and preponderance of the evidence as to require a new, trial in the
interest of justice, and, upon the basis of its said adjudication, to either affirm the judgment of the trial court or
grant a new trial." The determination of that issue was
foreclosed by Deen v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co.,
supra. The motion for leave to file a petition requesting
this Court to mandamus the Texas Supreme Court to conform its decision to our mandate in that case is granted.
Assuming as we do that the Supreme Court of Texas will
of course conform to the disposition we now make, we do
not issue the writ of mandamus.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
