DEEN v. HICKMAN,

CHIEF JUSTICE,

SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS,

ET AL.

ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS.

No. 133, Misc. Decided October 27, 1958.
In a case arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the
Texas Supreme Court entered a judgment which was foreclosed by
an earlier decision of this Court in the same case. Held: Leave to
file a petition for writ of mandamus to require the Texas Supreme
Court to conform its decision to the mandate of this Court- is
granted; but the writ is not issued, because it is assumed that the
Texas Supreme Court will conform to this decision:

David C. McCord and Robert Lee Guthrie for
petitioner.
Luther Hudson for the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Co., respondent.
PER CURIAM.

In Deen v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co., 353 U. S.
925, this Court, having held "that the proofs justified with
reason the jury's conclusion that employer negligence
played a part in producing the petitioner's injury," reversed the judgment of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals.
On remand, that court held that the question of negligence
was foreclosed by this Court's decision and affirmed a
judgment in favor of the petitioner on condition that
petitioner accept a remittitur. On review, the Texas Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Civil
Appeals "with directions . . . to adjudicate, upon its own
independent evaluation of the evidence and wholly apart
from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United
States, whether or not the jury finding of negligence of

the defendant . . .is so against the weight and preponderance of the evidence as to require a new, trial in the
interest of justice, and, upon the basis of its said adjudication, to either affirm the judgment of the trial court or
grant a new trial." The determination of that issue was
foreclosed by Deen v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co.,
supra. The motion for leave to file a petition requesting
this Court to mandamus the Texas Supreme Court to conform its decision to our mandate in that case is granted.
Assuming as we do that the Supreme Court of Texas will
of course conform to the disposition we now make, we do
not issue the writ of mandamus.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
