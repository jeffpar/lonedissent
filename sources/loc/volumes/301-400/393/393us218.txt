OCTOBER TERM, 1968.
December 9, 1968.

393 U. S.

PALMIERI v. FLORIDA.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA.

No. 131.

Argued November 20, 1968.-Decided December 9, 1968.

198 So. 2d 633, dismissed.

Phillip Goldman, by appointment of the Court, 392
U. S. 920, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.
Howard Mendelow, Assistant Attorney General of
Florida, argued the cause for respondent. With him on
the brief were Earl Faircloth, Attorney General, and
Edward Cowart, Assistant Attorney General.
PER CURIAM.

The petitioner was convicted of robbery in the Criminal Court of Dade County, Florida, and the judgment of
conviction was affirmed by the District Court of Appeal,
189 So. 2d 512, and the Supreme Court of Florida, 198 So.
2d 633. We granted certiorari because the case appeared
to present a substantial constitutional question concerning the admissibility at trial of "lineup" identifications
made after the petitioner was arrested without probable
cause for the sole purpose of gathering evidence against
him. 391 U. S. 934. However, upon the complete review of the record that has now become possible, and in
the light of oral argument by able and conscientious
counsel, it has become evident that the legality of the
petitioner's arrest was not at issue in the Florida appellate courts, and is not challenged here. Accordingly, the
writ is dismissed as improvidently granted.
It is so ordered.
