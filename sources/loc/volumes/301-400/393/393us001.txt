v. CALIFORNIA

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 605. Decided October 7, 1968.
Appeal dismissed.

Doris Brian Walker for appellants.
Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General of California,
Charles A. Barrett, Assistant Attorney General, and
Clayton P. Roche, Deputy Attorney General, for
appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The appeal is dismissed. California is on the eve of
a national election. Millions of ballots are being printed
and in a few hours the absentee ballots will be sent out of
State. Whatever may be the merits of the controversy,
the shortness of time and the complicated task of preparing and distributing the ballots make it very doubtful if
any effective relief would be possible.
