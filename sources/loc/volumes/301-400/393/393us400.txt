APPEAL

ET AL.

FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.

No. 731.

Decided January 20, 1969.

289 F. Supp. 784, affirmed.

Jack Greenberg, James M. Nabrit III, Melvin Zarr,
and Fred D. Gray for appellants.
MacDonald Gallion, Attorney General of Alabama,
and Gordon Madison, Assistant Attorney General, for
Alabama Public School and College Authority, and James
J. Carter for Members of the Board and the Board of
Trustees of Auburn University, appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The motions to affirm are granted and the judgment
is affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.

If my Brother HARLAN is correct and this is a local,
as distinguished from a state-wide, law, a question not
requiring a three-judge court (Moody v. Flowers, 387
U. S. 97), then we have been woefully wrong in other
school integration cases. For they have almost always
involved a single public school, which usually is wholly
local in its operation. But in those other three-judge
court cases we dealt with the operation of a state-wide
racial segregation regime. The present Act (Ala. Acts
1967, No. 403) regulates a state agency, the Alabama
Public School and College Authority, which issues and
sells bonds. And these bonds, so the case tells us, are

sold to construct what threatens to become an all-white
university.'
Can we say in 1969 that a State has no duty to disestablish a dual system of higher education based upon
race? The three-judge court in a careful opinion seems
to draw a line between elementary and secondary schools
on one hand and colleges and universities on the other.
The inference is that if this were an elementary school,
the result would be different.'
The problem is in effect a phase of "freedom of
choice" which was before us in another aspect in Green v.
County School Board, 391 U. S. 430.'
I would note probable jurisdiction and set the case
for argument.
dissenting.
Only two years ago, Moody v. Flowers, 387 U. S. 97,
101 (1967), made it clear that a three-judge court need
not be convoked whenever "a state statute is involved
but only when a state statute of general and statewide
application is sought to be enjoined." Although this
holding was solidly grounded in precedent and in policy,
the Court today abandons Moody without explanation
by taking jurisdiction to affirm this judgment summarily.
The case before us does not involve a statute of "general and statewide application." Appellants are simply
trying to prevent the construction of a single public
college to be located in the City of Montgomery. ApMR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

'The counterpart of this new predominantly all-white university
is Alabama State College, predominantly Negro.
2 This is on its face an amazing statement, as the forerunners of
Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 349 U. S. 294, were
cases involving higher education. See Missouri ex rel. Gaines v.
Canada, 305 U. S. 337; Sipuel v. Board of Regents, 332 U. S. 631;
Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629; McLaurin v. Oklahoma State
Regents, 339 U. S. 637.
3 And see Raney v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 443; Monroe v.
Board of Commissioners, 391 U. S. 450.

like the fate of a county-wide reapportionment plan,
Moody v. Flowers, supra, or the affairs of a regional
drainage district, Rorick v. Commissioners, 307 U. S.
208 (1939), is not to be decided by a special three-judge
court. As Moody and Rorick teach, the bare fact that
a state statute is involved is not enough to trigger 28

1Although

the appellants' original complaint also contained a
challenge to the constitutionality of the Alabama statute creating
the State's Public School and College Authority, Ala. Acts, No. 243
(1965), this challenge was abandoned at the hearing on the merits.
See 289 F. Supp. 784, 785, n. 1 (1968).
2 While my Brother DOUGLAS is quite right in noting that Brown v.
Board of Education and two of its companion cases, 347 U. S. 483
(1954), were heard on appeal from three-judge District Courts, he
fails to recognize that in each of those cases, appellants had sought
to enjoin the operation of a state statute or constitutional provision of general application that either required or authorized racial
segregation in public and secondary schools. Id., at 486, n. 1. See
also, McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U. S. 637 (1950).
In contrast, our "freedom-of-choice" decisions of last Term, Green v.
County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968); Raney v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 443 (1968); Monroe v. Board of Commissioners,
391 U. S. 450 (1968), came to us on certiorari from the Fourth,
Eighth, and Sixth Circuits respectively, precisely because the plans
promulgated by the school boards in those cases were not of
state-wide scope. See also Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958)
(on certiorari to the Eighth Circuit); Griffin v. School Board, 377
U. S. 218 (1964) (on certiorari to the Fourth Circuit); Bradley v.
School Board, 382 U. S. 103 (1965) (on certiorari to the Fourth
Circuit); Rogers v. Paul, 382 U. S. 198 (1965) (on certiorari to
the Eighth Circuit); cf. Watson v. Memphis, 373 U. S. 526 (1163)
(on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit).
Indeed, even when there is an attack on a state-wide statute which

J., dissenting.

We do not deal here with a state statute which "embodies a policy of statewide concern," Spielman Motor
Sales Co. v. Dodge, 295 U. S. 89, 94 (1935), but one
which expresses a judgment that more educational facilities are needed in a particular locality. Indeed, appellants' constitutional attack on the statute is entirely
based on the peculiar local situation existing in Montgomery. At present, there are two state-supported
institutions of higher learning in the city. Alabama
State is a four-year college which has traditionally been
attended by Negroes. Alabama Extension Center, on
the other hand, has a predominantly white enrollment,
but does not at present grant degrees, offering its students a set of "extension" courses. The Extension Center, however, will be enlarged to create Montgomery's
new four-year college, while Negro Alabama State has
been entirely ignored in the planning. Appellants contend that, at a minimum, the State's College Authority
was constitutionally obliged to consider the possibility
of coordinating the new college's operations with those of
Alabama State before the Authority could properly
embark on its present course.
This brief outline of the facts demonstrates that we are
dealing with an essentially local dispute which could
properly be heard first by a single District Judge and
then by the Court of Appeals before it came to us on
certiorari.'
I would dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction.
requires racial discrimination on its face, a three-judge court need
not be convoked if the statute is clearly invalid under pre-existing
case law. Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31 (1962).
3 Appellants themselves seem to have recognized that this Court's
jurisdiction is questionable. They filed a protective appeal with
the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on August 23, 1968. That
court is holding the appeal in abeyance pending our decision in this
case. See Jurisdictional Statement 2, n. 1.
