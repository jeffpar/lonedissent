343 U. S.

V. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 379.

Submitted March 3, 1952.-Decided June 9, 1952.

In this case, in which conflicting views as to the facts on the controlling issue and the inferences to be drawn from them would have
to be resolved, the Solicitor General's confession of error, leaving
the way open for a new trial, is accepted, and the judgment of
conviction is reversed as to all the petitioners.
191 F. 2d 1, reversed.

F. M. Reischling submitted on brief for petitioners.
Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General
McInerney, James L. Morrisson,Beatrice Rosenberg and
Murry Lee Randall submitted on brief for the United
States.
PER CURIAM.

The controlling claim in this case is that there was an
unreasonable search and seizure of evidence, the admission of which vitiated the convictions. Before determining these issues conflicting views as to the facts in this
case and the inferences to be drawn from them would
have to be resolved. The Solicitor General confesses
error and asks that the judgment below should be reversed as to all the petitioners, leaving of course the. way
open for a new trial. To accept in this case his confession
of error would not involve the establishment of any
precedent.
Accordingly we reverse the judgment as to all the
petitioners.
Reversed.

and MR. JUSTICE REED join, dissenting.

I do not believe we should take our law from the Department of Justice or from any other litigant. The rea-

sons why the Department of Justice confesses error in
a case may be wholly honorable. For example, those in
the Solicitor General's office may be honestly converted
to the point of view which their colleagues opposed below.
I assume that istrue in the present case. But I also know
that litfg~rts usually have selfish purposes. What the
motivation behind a particular confession of 6rror may be
will seldom be known. We cannot become a party to it
without serving the unknown cause of the litigant.
The practice in cases in which the Solicitor General
confesses error was settled by Young v. United States, 315
U. S. 257 (1942). When the Government confessed error
on Young's petition for certiorari, the confession was not
accepted but, instead, the petition was granted and the
case set down for argument. 314 U. S'595 (1941). In
the unanimous opinion of the Court, two* Justices not
participating, the function of this Court upon the Government's confession of error was described with
particularity:
"The public trust reposed in the law enforcement
officers of the Government requires that they be
quick to confess error when, in their opinion, a miscarriage of justice may result from their remaining
silent. But such a confession does not relieve this
Court of the performance of the judicial function.
The considered judgment of the law enforcement.
officers that reversible error has been committed is
entitled to great weight, but our judicial obligations
-compel us to examine independently the errors confessed. See Parltonv. United States, 75 F. 2d 772.
The public interest that a result be reached which
promotes a well-ordered society is foremost in every
criminal proceeding. That interest is entrusted to
our consideration and protection as well as to that
of the enforcing officers. Furthermore, our j udg-

ments are precedents, and the proper administration
of the criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of parties. Cf. Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr. 2527,
2551, 98 Eng. Rep. 327; State v. Green, 167 Wash.
266, 9 P. 2d 62." 315 U. S., at 258-259.
As a result, the Court proceeded to examine the errors
urged by petitioner and, upon consideration of the record,
reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1
The principles announced in Young v. United States,
supra, were expressly reaffirmed in Gibson v. United
States, 329 U. S. 338, 344 (1946); cf. Marino v. Ragen,
332 U. S. 561, 562 (1947).
Moreover, the practice of
this Court in cases in which the Solicitor General confesses error has followed the Young rule. Unlike today's
per curiam, our recent per curiam orders and opinions
have been careful to note that our reversal of a court
of appeals judgment is based upon consideration of the
record, not blind acceptance of a confession of error.'
1 During

the same term of Court as Young v. United States, 8upra,
the Government also confessed error in Weber v. United States. The
Court granted certiorari, 314 U. S. 600 (1941), heard argument, and
affirmed the Court of Appeals judgment by an equally divided Court.
315 U. S. 787 (1942).
2 In Upshaw v. United States, 335 U. S. 410 (1948), the Government
had confessed error in the Court of 'Appeals for the District of
Columbia. That court, adheringto its precedent in Parltonv. United
States, 64 App. D. C. 169, 75 F. 2d 772 (1935) (cited with approval
in Young v. United States, supra, at 259), conducted an independent
examination of the errors confessed. 83 U. S. App. D. C. 207, 168
F. 2d 167 (1948). This Court reversed in a 5-4 decision without
suggesting that the Court of Appeals had erred in considering the
merits of the Government's position.
8Cates v. Haderlein, 342 U. S. 804 (1951); Chiarella v. United
. States, 341 U. S. 946 (1951); Ryles v. United States, 336 U. S. 949
(1949); Bellaskus v. Crossman, 335 U. S. 840 (1948); Fogel v. United
States, 335 U. S. 865 (1948); Wixman v. United States, 335 U. S.

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

We sit in this case not to enforce the requests of the
Department of Justice but to review the action of a lower
court. Here the Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners
had no standing to complain of the search. That ruling
is questionable in view of the intervening decision of this
Court in United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48. But the
confession of error is not limited to that ruling. The Department of Justice now maintains that the District Court
was in error in ruling in the Government's favor on the
issue of search and seizure.
The facts are not in dispute. The only question is the
reach of our decision in Carrollv. United States, 267 U. S.
132. That decision states a principle of constitutional
law. Until it is reversed or modified, it prescribes a rule
for the courts,to apply according to their best lights, not
according to the desires of either the prosecution or the
defense.
Since the Court of Appeals did not reach that issue
when the case was before it, we should at the very least
remand the case to it for consideration of that question.
If we are to decide it, we should do so only after full exploration of the facts and the law. Whatever action we
take is a precedent.
I cannot state too strongly my belief that if the courts
are to retain their independence, they must decide cases
taken. on the merits. A confession of error by a litigant
is, of course, an important factor to take into account in'
studying a record.' It may disclose an*intervening decision on a question of law that undermines the lower
4 Similarly, the fact that the Solicitor General does not oppose the
granting of a petition for certiorari is'entitled to respect, see, e. g.,
Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33; 36 (1950). But it has
never followed that we should automatically grant certiorari because
of the Government's consent to such action. E. g., Community Services, Inc. v. United States, 342 U. S. 932 (1952) (certiorari denied);
Dollar v. United States, 342 U. S. 910, (1952) (certiorari denied).

court's conclusion; it may disclose perjury by an important witness or newly discovered evidence; it may disclose
other factors which weaken the conclusion of the lower
court. Or it may disclose a maneuver to save one case
at the expense of another.' Once we accept a confession
of error at face value and make it the controlling and
decisive factor in our decision, we no longer administer
a system of justice under a government of laws.

5The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a treason conviction,
one ground of affirmance being that. the methods of expatriation
listed in the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, were exclusive.
Kawakita v. United States, 190 F. 2d 506, 511-514 (1951).. We
granted certiorari, 342 U. S. 932, and affirmed the Court of Appeals
without resolving the question. 343 U. S.717. The Solicitor General urged in support of the conviction that the expatriation procedures of the Nationality Act were exclusive.
In the District of Columbia Circuit, a judgment denying a claim
of citizenship was affirmed, one ground of affirmance being that
methods of expatriation listed in the Nationality Act of 1940 were not
exclusive. Mandoli v. Acheson, 193 F. 2d 920, 922 (1952). In his
memorandum in response to the Mandoli petition for certiorari, the
Solicitor General, adhering to his position in Kawakita, asserted that
this ground of the Court of Appeals decision in this case is "clearly
erroneous."
