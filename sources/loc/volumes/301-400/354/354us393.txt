BLACKBURN v. ALABAMA.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ALABAMA.

No. 426.

Argued May 2, 1957.-Decided June 17, 1957.

On the record in this case, it is uncertain whether petitioner's claim
to protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment was passed on by the State Court of Appeals, and the
judgment of that Court is vacated and the cause remanded to that
Court, so that it may pass on that claim.
38 Ala. App. 143, 88 So. 2d 199, judgment vacated and cause
remanded.

Truman Hobbs argued the cause and filed a brief for
petitioner.
Paul T. Gish, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of Alabama, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the
brief were John Patterson, Attorney General, and Bernard F. Sykes, Assistant Attorney General.
PER CURIAM.

The record in this case leaves us uncertain whether
petitioner's claim to the protection of the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution was passed upon by the Court of
Appeals of Alabama. 38 Ala. App. 143, 88 So. 2d 199.
Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the cause to that court in order that
it may pass upon this claim. Minnesota v. National
Tea Co., 309 U. S. 551.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

with whom

THE CHIEF JUSTICE

and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.

Petitioner has made as strong a showing as possible
that he signed the confession when he was insane.
Throughout the whole proceeding he has claimed that
the confession was involuntary. The judgment should
therefore be reversed. See Chambers v. Florida,309 U. S.
227; Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556.
