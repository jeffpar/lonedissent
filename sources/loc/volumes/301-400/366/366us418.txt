JUSTICE FRANK-

join, dissenting.

This application for the issuance of a writ of habeas
corpus was filed as an original action in the Court of
Criminal Appeals of Texas. Neither the record, the briefs,
nor argument of counsel indicates that such an action has
ever been filed in a District Court of Texas as appears
to be required by Texas procedure. See Ex parte Rod-

Ex parte Fitzpatrick, 167 Tex. Cr. R. 376, 320 S. W. 2d
683 (1959); Ex parte Brooks, 85 Tex. Cr. R. 397, 212
S. W. 956 (1919). The judgment of the Court of Criminal
Appeals might, therefore, have been based upon an independent state ground. In this condition of the record, I
would affirm the judgment without prejudice to the petitioner's filing in any appropriate Texas District Court an
application for a writ of habeas corpus to test out the
validity of his detention. See Vernon's Tex. Code Crim.
