BLOSS

ET AL.

398 U. S.

v. DYKEMA

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF MICHIGAN

No. 1347.

Decided June 1, 1970

Certiorari granted; judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals,
17 Mich. App. 318, 169 N. W. 2d 367, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted and the
judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed.
Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767.
and MR. JUSTICE WHITE are of
the opinion that certiorari should be denied.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

dissenting.

I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of
Appeals upon principles heretofore often expressed by
me. See my opinions in Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 496 (1957); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184,
203 (1964); Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413,
455 (1966).

From the standpoint of what I regard as

the permissible exercise of state power in this field, the
materials in this case fall far short of the "borderline"
movie involved in Cain v. Kentucky (reversed summarily), 397 U. S. 319 (1970), see my dissent in that
case, and I am at a loss to understand how these
materials can be deemed to qualify for Redrup treat-

ment when only a short time ago the Court declined to
accord that treatment to the materials involved in Spicer
v. New York, cert. denied, 397 U. S. 1042.
