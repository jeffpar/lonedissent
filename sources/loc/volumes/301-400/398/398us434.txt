OCTOBER TERM, 1969
June 15, 1970

398 U. S.

WALKER v. OHIO
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO

No. 1470,

Decided June 15, 1970

Reversed.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is reversed. Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767 (1967).
dissenting.
The trial court, endeavoring to apply the standards
articulated by this Court, held that the materials in question are obscene within the meaning of the relevant Ohio
statute. This conclusion rested on findings that the
materials are patently offensive to contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; that, when taken as a whole,
their dominant theme appeals to the prurient interest
of the reader; and that they are utterly without redeeming social value. The Ohio appellate courts declined to
disturb that judgment. Yet today the Court reverses,
citing only Redrup.
I dissent from such a summary disposition, not only
for the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in Cain
v. Kentucky, 397 U., S. 319 (1970), but also because I
find no justification, constitutional or otherwise, for this
Court's assuming the role of a supreme and unreviewable
board of censorship for the 50 States, subjectively judging each piece of material brought before it without
regard to the findings or conclusions of other courts,
state or federal. That is not one of the purposes for
which this Court was established.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, for reasons expressed in his

opinions in Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 496
(1957); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 203 (1964);
and Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, 455 (1966),
would leave the judgment of the state court undisturbed.

BASSETT v. SMITH, WARDEN
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF GEORGIA

No. 1658, Misc.

Decided June 15, 1970

Certiorari granted; 226 Ga. 10, 172 S. E. 2d 407, vacated and
remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The
judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia affirming the
denial of habeas corpus is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further consideration after petitioner has been afforded adequate access to a copy of the
transcript of the trial court hearing on his petition for
habeas corpus. Lane v. Brown, 372 U. S. 477 (1963);
Long v. District Court, 385 U. S. 192 (1966); cf. Wade v.
Wilson, 396 U. S. 282 (1970).
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN

took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
