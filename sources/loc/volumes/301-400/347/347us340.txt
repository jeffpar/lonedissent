MILLER BROTHERS CO. v. MARYLAND.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND.

No. 160.

Argued January 5, 1954.-Decided April 5, 1954.

A Delaware merchandising corporation sells directly to customers at
its store in Delaware. It does not accept mail or telephone orders,
and makes no solicitation of customers other than by newspaper,
radio, and occasional direct mail advertising. Residents of nearby
Maryland come to the store and make purchases which they take
away or which are delivered to them in Maryland by common
carrier or by the store's own truck. Maryland lays upon its
residents an excise tax on "the use, storage, or consumption" in
the State of such articles, and it requires every vendor to collect
and remit the tax to the State. The Delaware store did not do
this, and a truck belonging to it was seized in Maryland and held
liable for the use tax on all goods sold to Maryland residents, however delivered. Held: The Maryland taxing act, as applied to
this Delaware store, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 341-347.
(a) Seizure of property by a State under pretext of taxation
when there is no jurisdiction or power to tax is confiscation and
a denial of due process of law. P. 342.
(b) The Delaware corporation, by its acts or course of dealing,
has not subjected itself to the taxing power of Maryland and has
not afforded to that State a jurisdiction or power to impose upon
it a liability for collection of the Maryland tax. Pp. 344-346.
(c) Due process requires some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction
it seeks to tax. Pp. 344-345.
(d) Maryland could not have reached this Delaware vendor with
a sales tax on these sales, and cannot make them a basis for imposing on the vendor liability for use taxes due from Maryland
residents. Pp. 345-346.
(e)- General Trading Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 322 U. S. 335,

JACKSON,

an-

Appellant is a Delaware merchandising corporation
which only sells directly to customers at its store in Wilmington, Delaware. It does not take orders by mail or
telephone. Residents of nearby Maryland come to its
store and make purchases, some of which they carry
away, some are delivered to them in Maryland by common carrier, and others by appellant's own truck. Maryland lays upon its residents an excise tax on "the use,
storage or consumption" in the State 'of such articles,1
and it requires every vendor to collect and remit the tax to
the State.2 This the appellant did not do. Finding appellant's truck in Maryland, the State seized it, and the
State's highest court has held it liable for the use tax
on all goods sold in the Delaware store to Maryland
residents, however delivered.3 This was against appellant's timely contention that the Maryland taxing act, so
construed, conflicts with the federal commerce power and
attempts to extend the power of the State beyond its
borders in violation of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The parties have stipulated
facts in detail, and, so far as they seem important, we
set them forth in the Appendix.
The grounds advanced by Maryland for holding the
Delaware vendor liable come to this: (1) the vendor's
advertising with Delaware papers and radio stations,
though not especially directed to Maryland inhabitants,

reached, and was known to reach, their notice; (2) its
occasional sales circulars mailed to all former customers
included customers in Maryland; (3) it delivered some
purdhases to common carriers consigned to Maryland
addresses; (4) it delivered other purchases by its own
vehicles to Maryland locations. The question is whether
these factors, separately or in the aggregate, in each or all
of the above types of sales; establish a state's power to
impose a duty upon such an out-of-state merchant to
collect and remit a purchaser's use tax.
It is a venerable if trite observation that seizure of
property by the state under pretext of taxation when
there is no jurisdiction or power to tax is simple confiscation and a denial of due process of law. "No.principle
is better settled than that the power of a State, even its
power of taxation, in respect to property, is limited to
such as is within its jurisdiction." New York, L. E. &
W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 153 U. S. 628, 646. "Where
there is jurisdiction neither as to person nor property, the
imposition of a tax would be ultra vires and void. If the
legislature of a State should enact that the citizens or
property of another State or country should be taxed in
the same manner as the persons and property within its
own limits and subject to its authority, or in any other
manner whatsoever, such a law would be as much a
nullity as if in conflict with the most explicit constitutional inhibition. Jurisdiction is as necessary to valid
legislative as to valid judicial action." St. Louis v.
Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423, 430.
But visible territorial boundaries do not always establish the limits of a state's taxing power or jurisdiction.
In the last twenty years, revenue needs have come to
exceed the demands that legislatures feel it expedient to
make upon accumulated wealth or property with fixed
location within the state. The states therefore have
turned to taxing activities connected with the movement

Opinion of the Court.

of commerce, such as exchange and consumption. If
there is some jurisdictional fact or event to serve as a
conductor, the reach of the state's taxing power may be
carried to objects Of taxation beyond its borders. When
it has the taxpayer within its power or jurisdiction, it
may sometimes, through him, reach his extraterritorial
income or transactions. On the other hand, if it has
jurisdiction of his taxable property or transactions, it
may sometimes, through these, reach the nonresident.
Whether this is one of these cases we must inquire.
We are dealing with a relatively new and experimental
form of taxation.5 Taxation of sales or purchases and
taxation of use or possession of purchases are complementary and related but serve very different. purposes;
The former, a fiscal measure of considerable importance,
has the effect of increasing the cost to the consumer of
acquiring supplies in the taxing state. The use tax, not
in itself a relatively significant revenue producer,6 usually
appears as a support to the sales tax in two respects.
One is protection of the state's revenues by taking away
from inhabitants the advantages of fesort to untaxed
out-of-state purchases. The other is protection of local
merchants against out-of-state competition from those
who may be enabled by lower tax burdens to offer lower
prices. In this respect, the use tax has the same effect
as a protective tariff becoming due not on purchase of
the goods but at the moment of bringing them into the
taxing states." The collection of the use tax from
inhabitants is a difficult administrative problem, and if
out-of-state vendors can be compelled to collect it and
remit it to the taxing state, it simplifies administration.
But this raises questions of great importance to particular taxpayers, to the course of commercial dealing among
the states and as to appropriation by other states of tax
resources properly belonging to the state where the event
*occurs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1953.
Opinion 'of the Court.

347 U. S.

The practical and legal effect of the Maryland statute
as it has been applied to this Delaware vendor is to make
the vendor liable for a use tax due from the purchaser.
In economic consequence, it is identical with making him
pay a sales tax. The liability arises only because of a
Delaware sale-and is measured by its proceeds. But at
the time of the sale, no one is liable for a Maryland use
tax. That liability arises only upon importation of the
merchandise to the taxing state, an event which occurs
after the sale is complete and one as to which the vendor
may have no control or even knowledge, at least as to
merchandise carried away. by the buyer. The consequence is that liability against the Delaware vendor is
predicated upon use of the goods in another state and
by another person. We do not understand the State to
contend that it could lay a use tax upon mere possession
of goods in transit by a carrier or vendor upon entering
the State, nor do we see how such a tax could be
consistent with the Commerce Clause.
The question here is whether this vendor, by its acts
or course of dealing, has subjected itself to the taxing
power of Maryland or whether it has afforded that State
a jurisdiction or power to create this collector's liability.
Despite the increasing frequency with which the question
arises, little constructive discussion can be found in responsible commentary as to the grounds on which to
rest a state's power to reach extraterritorial transactions
or nonresidents with tax liabilities. Our decisions are not
always clear as to the grounds on which a tax is supported,
especially where more than one exists; nor are all of our
pronouncements during the experimental period of this
type of taxation consistent or reconcilable. A few have
been specifically overruled, while others no longer fully
represent the present state of the law. But the course
of decisions does reflect at least consistent adherence to
one time-honored concept; that due process requires some

MILLER BROS. CO. v. MARYLAND.
340

Opinion of the Court.

definite link, some minimum connection, between a state
and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.
Thus, the Court has frequently held that domicile or
residence, more substantial than mere presence in transit
or sojourn, is an adequate basis for taxation, including
income,' property,9 and death "otaxes. Since the Fourteenth Amendment makes one a citizen of the state
wherein he resides, the fact of residence creates universally recognized reciprocal duties of protection by the
state and of allegiance and support by the citizen. The
latter obviously includes a duty to pay taxes, and their
nature and measure is largely a political matter, Of
course, the situs of property may tax it regardless of the
citizenship, domicile or residence of the owner, the most
obvious illustration being a tax on realty laid by the
state in which the realty is located." Also, the keeping
of tangible 12 or intangible 1" personalty within a state
may give it a similar taxable situs there (sometimes
called a business or commercial situs or domicile). Certain activities or transactions carried on within a state,
such as the use 1 and sale 15 of property, may give jurisdiction to tax whomsoever engages therein, and the use
of highways may subject the use to certain types of taxation." These cases overlap with those in which incorporation by a state 11 or permission to do business there' 8
forms the basis for proportionate taxation of a company,
including its franchise, capital, income and property.
Recent cases in which a taxable sale does not clearly take
place within the taxing state, elements of the transaction
occurring in different states, have presented peculiar difficulties, " as have those where the party liable for a use tax
does not use the product within the taxing state.'
We are unable to find in any of our cases a precedent
for sustaining the liability asserted by Maryland here.
In accordance with the principles of earlier cases, it was
recently settled that Maryland could not have reached

this Delaware vendor with a sales tax on these sales.
McLeod v. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S. 327. Can she then
make the same Delaware sales a basis for imposing on
the vendor liability for use taxes due from her own inhabitants? It would be a strange law that would make
appellant more vulnerable to liability for 'another's tax
than to a tax on itself.
The decisions relied upon by Maryland do not, in our
view, support her. This is not the case of a merchant
entering a state to maintain a branch and engaging in
admittedly taxable retail business but trying to allocate
some part of his total sales to nontaxable interstate commerce. Under these circumstances, the State has jurisdiction to tax the taxpayer, and all that he can question
on Due Process or Commerce Clause grounds is the
validity of the allocation. Cf. Nelson v. Montgomery
Ward & Co., 312 U. S. 373; Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck &
Co., 312 U. S. 359; Norton Co. v. Department of Revenue,
340 U. S.534.
The nearest support for Maryland's position is General Trading Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 322 U. S. 335.
The writer of this opinion dissented in that case and,
whether or not in so doing he made a correct application
of principles of jurisdiction to the particular facts, it is
clear that circumstances absent here were there present to
justify the Court's approval of liability for collecting the
tax. That was the case of an out-of-state merchant entering the taxing state through traveling sales agents to
conduct continuous local solicitation followed by delivery
of ordered goods to the customers, the only nonlocal
phase of the total sale being acceptance of the order.
Probably, except for credit reasons, acceptance was a
mere formality, since one hardly incurs the cost of soliciting orders to reject. The Court could properly approve
the State's decision to regard such a rivalry with its local
merchants as equivalent to being a local merchant. But

MILLER BROS. CO. v. MARYLAND.

Appendix to Opinion of the Court.

there is a wide gulf between this type of active and
aggressive operation within a taxing state and the occasional delivery of goods sold at an out-of-state store with
no solicitation other than the incidental effects of general
advertising. Here was no invasion or exploitation of the
consumer market in Maryland. On the contrary, these
sales resulted from purchasers traveling from Maryland
to Delaware to exploit its less tax-burdened selling
market. That these inhabitants incurred a liability for
the use tax when they used, stored or consumed the goods
in Maryland, no one doubts. But the burden of collecting or paying their tax cannot be shifted to a foreign
merchant in the absence of some jurisdictional basis not
present here.
In this view of the case, we need not consider whether
the statute imposes an unjustifiable burden upon interstate commerce.
The judgment appealed from is reversed and the case
remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
herewith.
Reversed and remanded.

3 Miller Brothers Co. v. Maryland, 201 Md. 535, 95 A. 2d 286.
4 "It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the attorneys
for the above named parties and on their behalf that:
"1. Defendant, Miller Brothers Company, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its
principal place of business at Ninth and King Streets, Wilmington,
Delaware. It has no resident agent in Maryland.
"2. Defendant is and for all times material to this suit has been
engaged in the retail household furniture business by selling its merchandise from its only retail store located in Wilmington, Delaware.
"3,. The only methods of advertising used by the Defendant are
the following:
"(a) Radio and Television. The Defendant has engaged in no
radio or television advertising of any sort, anywhere, since January
1, 1951. Prior to that date, the Defendant had limited radio advertising over the Wilmington, Delaware, stations. In the fall of
1950, for a period of about six weeks, the Defendant had a small
amount of television advertising over Station WDEL-TV in connection with the broadcasting of football scores. The facilities of those
stations are located in Delaware entirely. In the radio and television
advertising the Defendant has never had any script or copy which
made an appeal for out-of-state business or in any way was designed
directly or indirectly to appeal particularly to Maryland residents.
The radio slogan adopted by the Defendant was 'Furniture Fashion
Makers for Delaware'.
"(b) Newspapers. The Defendant advertises regularly in the
Wilmington Morning News and the Wilmington Journal every evening. It also advertises occasionally in the- Wilmington Sunday
Star. All of these newspapers are published in Wilmington and

undoubtedly have some circulation in some portions of Maryland.
The volume of such circulation is unknown to either the Plaintiff or
the Defendant. In its newspaper advertising the Defendant has
never used advertising copy which mentions Maryland customers or
is prepared for the purpose of directly, or indirectly making any
special appeal t6 the Maryland customers. No advertising has ever
been done by the Defendant in any newspapers published in
Maryland.
"(c) Use of the Mails. The Defendant uses an automatic card
mailing system and with' this system distributes about four pieces
a year. These mailing pieces go out to everyone who has purchased
from the Defendant and whose name and address is on the Defendant's records. This means that Maryland residents do receive these
mailing pieces, but no specific advertising copy has ever been sent
through the mails for the specific purpose of attracting Maryland
buyers. No advertising copy has been sent to Maryland buyers
alone and the only advertising' copy which these Maryland buyers
receive is that which is sent to all customers whose names and addresses are on the records.
"4. Defendant h~s made and does make certain sales of tangible
personal property, some of which sales being the subject matter of
this action, to residents of the State of Maryland, who have used,
consumed or stored or will use, consume or store the purchased
personal property in the State of Maryland.
"5. The transactions between the Defendant and the said Maryland purchasers are and have been as follows:'
"(a) It is the Defendant's policy never to accept telephone orders.
Most of the merchandise sold by the Defendant requires personal
inspection and selection, and it is for this r~ason that telephone orders
are refused. The Defendant maintains no mail-order business and
does not make use of coupons in connection with its newspaper
advertising.
"(b) The purchaser appears at Defendant's retail store, located
in Wilmington, Delaware. In about thirty per cent (30%) of the
sales the exact item selected by the customer is tagged in the store
and that same item is delivered to the customer from the store, in
Wilmington, Delaware. In the remainder of 'the sales, an item
identical to that selected by the customer is delivered from the
Defendant's storeroom or warehouse in Wilmington, Delaware.
" (c) Delivery is made in one of three ways and no other:
"(1) The article is taken away by the purchaser. Within the
taxable period of July 1, 1947, through December-31, 1951, tangible

MILLER BROS. CO. v. MARYLAND.
340

Appendix to Opinion of the Court.

personal property sold for at least $2,500 was delivered in this
manner.
"(2) The article is delivered in Maryland to the purchaser in a
motor vehicle owned and operated by Defendant, directly from Defendant's store in Wilmington, Delaware, to the residence of the
Maryland purchaser. The cost of the delivery in such a case is
borne by Defendant and no charge therefor is made to the purchaser.
Within the taxable period July 1, 1947, through December 31, 1951,
tangible personal property sold for at least $8,000 was delivered in
this manner.
"(3) The article is delivered in Maryland to the purchaser by
common carrier to which delivery is made by Defendant in Wilmington, Delaware. Such common carrier is usually an independent
trucking line authorized to do business as a commercial carrier by
the Interstate Commerce Commission. The cost of the delivery in
such a case is borne by the Defendant and no charge therefor is made
to the purchaser. Within the taxable period July 1, 1947, through
December 31, 1951, tangible personal property sold for at least
$1,500 was delivered in this manner.
"6. (a) Payment for some purchases is completed at the time the
purchaser appears at the Defendant's retail store and prior to the
delivery.
"(b) The Defendant does make sales to some Maryland residents
on credit in exactly the same w-ay as it sells to Delaware residents on
credit. In the case of most of such credit sales to Maryland customers, the Defendant enters into conditional sales contracts with
its Maryland customers in the same way that it enters into conditional sales contracts with its Delaware customers. In many other
instances, the Defendant notes the terms of the credit transaction
on the sales slip without requiring a conditional sales agreement, and
this method of business is used without any distinction between
Maryland and Delaware customers. This method is frequently
designated as a 60 or 90-day charge account. At no time within the
past eight years has the Defendant ever recorded its conditional
sales contracts in Maryland.
"(c) The Defendant has never repossessed by legal process any
furniture or other merchandise for any customers in Maryland or
elsewhere within the last fifteen years. The Defendant has on occasion accepted back merchandise which has not been satisfactory to
the customer. In the event of delinquency in payments, the Defendant uses collection letters, which are sent through the mails..
During the past ten years the Defendant has never instituted legal

action through a Magistrate's or other Court in Maryland, nor has
it in that period used a collection agent in Maryland. The Defendant employs no collectors. The Maryland customers make payments
to the Defendant personally at the store in Wilmington, Delaware,
or by check, cash or money order sent through the mails.
"(d) No C. 0. D. deliveries are made.
"7. Except to the extent, if any, disclosed above, Defendant does
not maintain, occupy or use, nor has it ever in the past maintained,
occupied or used, permanently or temporarily, directly or indirectly,
or through a subsidiary or agent, by whatever name called, any
office, branch, place of distribution, sales or sample rooms or place,
warehouse or storage place, or other place of business in the State of
Maryland.
"8. Except to the extent, if any, disclosed above, Defendant does
not have, nor has it ever had, any representative, agent, salesman,
canvasser oi solicitor operating in the State of Maryland for the
purpose of selling or taking any orders for tangible personal property,
or delivering the same.
"9. Defendant is not, nor has it ever been, qualified or registered
to do business in the State of Maryland.
"10. On or about March 10, 1952, the Comptroller of the State of
Maryland assessed a deficiency in Use Tax against the Defendant in
the amount of $356.40, $240.00 thereof representing the use tax
claimed to be due, $32.40 thereof as interest claimed to be due and
$84.00 thereof as a penalty claimed to be due for the tax period from
July 1, 1947, through December 31, 1951, based upon all the sales
referred to in paragraph 5 above.
"11. Defendant has not applied for a permit nor been authorized
by the Comptroller to collect any use tax under Section 312 of Article
81 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1947 Supp.).
"12. Defendant has not applied for, nor paid the license fee required to obtain, nor has been issued, a liceise pursuant to Sections
331-333 of Article 81 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1947
Supp.).
"13. Except as indicated above, Defendant does not engage and
has not engaged in any activities in the State of Maryland."

dissenting.
The States have been increasingly turning to sales and
use taxes to raise the revenues they need to educate, protect, and serve their growing number of citizens. Unless
the States can collect a sales or use tax upon goods being
purchased out-of-state, there is a fertile opportunity for
the citizen who wants state benefits without paying taxes
to buy out-of-state. And there are just-across-the-stateline merchants who capitalize upon this opportunity.
After today's decision there will be more.
I see no constitutional difficulty in making appellant a
tax collector for Maryland under the general principles
announced in General Trading Co. v. 'ax Commission,
322 U. S. 335. When appellant's sales clerks make out
the sales slips and arrange for the shipment of the purchased goods, they surely will know which are destined for
Maryland, which for some other State. Hence to make
appellant add the Maryland use tax to- the bill when the
purchaser requests that the goods be shipped to Maryland is only a minimal buiden. Appellant will be paid

for its trouble.1 If liability were sought to be imposed
under circumstances indicating that appellant had been
taken by surprise or treated unfairly, different considerations would come into play. But. appellant in this case
pleads immunity, not ignorance of the Maryland law nor
harshness in its application.
This is not a case of a minimal contact between a vendor
and the collecting State. Appellant did not sell cashand-carry without knowledge of the destination of the
goods; and its delivery truck was not in Maryland upon
a casual, nonrecurring visit. Rather there has been a
course of conduct in which the appellant has regularly
injected advertising into media reaching Maryland consumers and regularly effected deliveries within Maryland
by its own delivery trucks and by common carriers.2
Jurisdiction over appellant in this suit was obtained
when its motor vehicle was attached while it was being
used in Maryland. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714;
Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U. S. 94. If appellant chooses
to keep out of Maryland entirely, then the Maryland
courts will of course have no jurisdiction over it. But
as long as appellant chooses to do some business there, I
see nothing in the Due Process Clause which would prevent Maryland from making it a collector for taxes on
sales which appellant knows are destined for Maryland
homes.
The Maryland statute provides that the vendor-collector may retain 3 percent of the gross tax as compensation for collection and
remittance expenses. Flack's Md. Ann. Code, 1951, Art. 81, § 384.
2 The parties stipulated that appellant advertises in Maryland,
both by Delaware newspapers which circulate across the state line
and by direct mail to Maryland customers. It was also stipulated
that, over a four-and-a-half-year period, at least $12,000 -worth of
merchandise was sold by appellant to Maryland purchasers for Maryland use. Approximately two-thirds of this merchandise was delivered by appellant to its Maryland customers in a motor vehicle
owned and operated by appellant.
