BOWMAN v. LOPERENA ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 59. Submitted November 20, 1940.-Decided December 9, 1940.
1. A petition in the bankruptcy court for a rehearing, from the
denial',of which an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of
Appeals in this case, held a petition for rehearing of an order
adjudging the debtor a bankrupt. P. 265.
2. Where a petition for rehearing of an order of the bankruptcy
court adjudging the debtor a bankrupt is allowed to be filed out of
time, and the court upon consideration of the merits denies the
petition, the time for the taking of an appeal from the order of
adjudication runs not from the date of such order but from the
date of the denial of'the petition for rehearing. P. 266.
110 F. 2d 348, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 310 U. S. 621, to review the dismissal of
an appeal from an order of the bankruptcy court adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt.

Mr. Llewellyn A. Luce submitted for petitioner.
No appearance for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The sole question for decision is whether the Circuit
Court of Appeals properly dismissed as untimely an appeal from an order made by a District Court sitting in
bankruptcy.
The proceeding was initiated by the petitioner, hereinafter spoken of as the debtor, in the District Court, for

Opinion of the Court.

an extension under § 74 of the Bankruptcy, Act as
amended.1 The petition, filed May 23, 1935, was referred
to a referee, who denied it July 26, 1935. May 15, 1936,
the court, on petition for review, re-referred tho cause to
a referee, who, on August 19, 1936, filed his certificatewith the court in which he concluded: "I therefore recommend that the proposal or proposals of the debtor for
an extension under § 74 of the Bankruptcy Act be not
confirmed, and that the debtor be adjudicated a
bankrupt."
August 21, 1936, the District Court, -reciting the referee's recommendation, made an order adjudicating the
debtor a bankrupt and again referring the cause to the
referee for further proceedings in bankruptcy.
August 28, 1936, the debtor prayed a review and the
referee certified the matter to the court. In the petition
for review both the action of the referee in reporting his
recommendations instead of granting or dismissing the
petition for extension, and the action of the court on the
referee's report adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt, were
challenged. September .10, 1936, the debtor filed a petition for rehearing of the order of adjudication, praying
that it be vacated and the 'cause reheard. October 14,
1936, motion was filed by the debtor, after due notice
to the parties in interest, praying that the order of adjudication be yacated and the proceeding dismissed without
prejudice.
October 16, 1936, a district judge heard the motion for
rehearing and the motion to vacate the adjudication and
entered an order that the entire matter of the debtor's
petition for extension which was re-referred to the referee
May 15, 1936,. be again re-referred to him with direction
to hear and consider the petition for extension and any
supplemental petition, and to make an order or orders

7, 1934, c. 424, § 2, 48 Stat. 922, 923; 11 U. S. C. (1934) § 202.

thereon as provided by the Act and the General Orders,
and continuing: "it is further ordered that all proceedings
herein, other than those hereinabove ordered, and particularly any further proceedings under the Adjudication
and Order of Reference under 8ection 74 entered on August 21st, 1936, be stayed until the further order of this
Court made by a Judge thereof." It will be observed
that the.court did not finally dispose of the petition and
motion so far as they were directed to the adjudication
of the debtor.
Proceedings on a supplemental proposal of extension
were had before the referee from time to time ard eventuated, on June 14, 1937, in an order denying the petition
for extension. The debtor presented a petition for review to the referee July 15, 1937, and thereupon the
latter made and forwarded to the court his certificate
reciting the proceedings and certifying the evidence. The
matter came on for hearing before the District Court and,
on October 25, 1937, a judge of that court confirmed the
order of the referee and ordered that the stay of proceedings under the order' of adjudication of August 21, 1936,
should be vacated and that the referee should proceed to
perform his duties under the adjudication and order of
reference.
November 15, 1937, the debtor filed a petition for rehearing in which he asked, inter alia, -that the adjudication in bankruptcy be vacated and set aside. On the
same day a judge of the District Court endorsed upon
the"This
petition:
petition having been 'seasonally presented' and
'entertained' by the above entitled court,, permission to
file same is hereby granted."
The petition for rehearing was heard by i judge of the
District Court and, on February 17, 1938, he rendered
his opinion and made an order thereon. 24 F. Supp. 381.
In the opinion he said:

BOWMAN v. LOPERENA.

Opinion of the Court.

"Thismatter is before the- Court (a) on a petition to
review an order of this court' denying review of an order

to set aside adjudication; (b) on a petition to review an
order of the Referee calling a meeting of creditors for
electing, and electing a trustee, in the above entitled
estate."
His order was: "The petition for review is denied.'
March 18, 1938, an appeal to the Circuit Court of
Appeals was allowed by the District Court. In his petition for appeal the debtor stated that he "does hereby
appeal . . . from such order or orders, judgment or
judgments, and particularly from the order of adjudication, made and entered August 21, 1936, . . ." His first
assignment of error was to the order of adjudication.
The court below dismissed the appeal 2 in the view
that, while it was taken within thirty days of the 'order
denying the petition for rehearing, it came too late
because the adjudication was entered August 21, 1936,
and the time for appeal therefrom expired thirty days
thereafter unless the running of time for taking appeal
was suspended by application for rehearing. The court
construed the petition for rehearing of September 10,
1936, as directed rather to the action of the referee than'
to the order of adjudication, but that petition, as we
have seen, recited the adjudication, alleged that it was
erroneous, and prayed that it be vacated. This position was reiterated in the motion of October i4, 1936,
and both the petition and the motion' were heard together and were the basis of the order of October .16,
1936, re-referring the case and staying the effective date
of the adjudication until the further order of the court.
As appears from the order of October 25, 1937, the
District Judge understood that the question of. the propriety of the adjudication was before him and dealt
'In r6 Bowman, 110 F. 2d 348.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

with it in his denial of the petition. Treating the petition of September 10, 1936, and the motion of October
14, 1936, as petitions for rehearing of the order of adjudication, and the petition of November 15, 1937, as a
second petition for rehearing filed out of time, the endorsement upon the latter by a judge of the court, and
the hearing held and opinion announced upon it, show
that it was entertained by the court and dealt with upon
its merits. Until the order of February 17, 1938, no
final decision was rendered sustaining the adjudication as
against the debtor's attack.
These circumstances enlarged the time for taking appeal from the order of adjudication. The filing of an
untimely petition for rehearing which is not entertained
or considered on its merits, or a motion for leave to file
such a petition out of time, if not acted on or if denied
by the trial court, cannot operate to extend the time for
appeal.' But where the court allows the filing and, after
considering the merits, denies the petition, the judgment
of the court as originally entered does not become final
until such denial, and the time for appeal runs from the
date thereof.'
We hold that the court below should have entertained
the appeal.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
to the Circuit Court of -Appeals for further proceedings
in conformity to this opinion.
Reversed.
