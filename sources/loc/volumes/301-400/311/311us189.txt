CHIEF

JUSTICE

HuGHES delivered the opinion of

the Court.
These cases present the same question, that is, whether
under the Revenue Act of 1934, in the case of a joint returrn by husband and wife, the capital losses of one
spouse may be deducted from the capital gains of the
other.
In Helvering v. Janney, the wife realized net gains
from the sale of capital assets during 1934, and the husband realized net losses from the sale of capital assets
during the same year. They filed a joint income tax return reporting the capital gain, which represented the
difference between the wife's adjusted capital gains and
the husband's adjusted capital losses.. The Commissioner- ruled that the husband's losses could not be
applied to reduce the gains realized by his wife and
accordingly determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax
Appeals sustained the Commissioner (39 B. T. A. 240)
but the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 108 F. 2d 564.
In.Gaines v. Helvering, the husband realized a net gain
from the sale of capital assets during 1934, while his wife
sustained a net loss from the sale of capital assets. They
filed a joint return reporting a capital loss, which repre;sented the difference between the husband's net capital
gain and his wife's net capital loss. The Commissioner,
as in the Janney case, decided against this adjustment
and the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed. The Circuit

Opinion of the Court.

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the
decision of the Board. 111 F. 2d 144.
In view of the conflict between these decisions, we
granted certiorari. No. 36, 310 U. S. 617; No. 113,
October 14, 1940.
Section 51 (b) of the Revenue Act of 19341 with respect to the returns of husband and wife provided:
"(b) Husband and Wife.-If a husband and wife living.
together have an- aggregate net income for the taxable
year of $2,500 or over, or an aggregate gross income for
such year of $5,000 or over"(1) Each shall make such a return, or
"(2) The income of each shall be included in a single
joint return, in which case the'tax shall be computed on
the aggregate income."
The same provision in substance is found in the earlier
Revenue Acts from that of 1921.2
The "aggregate income," to which paragraph 2 of § 51
(b) refers, is clearly the aggregate net income as it is the
aggregate income on which "the tax is to be computed."
In that view the deductions to which either spouse'would
be entitled would be taken in the case of a joint return,
from the aggregate gross income.
That was the construction placed upon the provision
for a joint return in the Revenue Act of 1918 by the
Solicitor of Internal Revenue in an opinion rendered in
'48 Stat. 697.
'The Revenue Act of 1918, § 223, also provided for a joint return
by husband and wife. 40 Stat. 1074.
• Section 223 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1921 provided (42 Stat.

250):
"(b) If a husband and wife living together have an aggregate net
income for the taxable year of $2,000 or over, or an aggregate gross
income for such year of $5,000 or over"(1) Each dxl make such a return, or
"(2) The income of each shall be included in a single joint return,
in which case the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income."

1921." After considering the terms of the statute and
the reasonable inference 'as to the intent of Congress, the
Solicitor concluded:
"From the foregoing it follows that the proper construction of the Revenue Act of 1918 permits a husband
and wife living together, at their option, to file separate
returns or a single joint return. If a single joint return
is filed it is treated as the return of a taxable unit and
the net income disclosed by the return is subject to both
normal and surtax as though the return were that of a
single individual. In cases, therefore, in which the husband or wife has allowable deductions in excess of his or
her gross income, such excess may, if joint return is. filed,
be deducted from the net income of the other for the
purpose of computing both the normal and surtax."
The terms of the Revenue Act of 1921 made this view
even clearer.' Treasury Regulations 62, Article 401,
promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1921, apparently
followed the same view. That article provided as to
joint returns of husband and wife,"Where the income of each is included in a single joint
return, the tax is computed on the aggregate income and
all deductions and credits to which either is entitled shall
be taken from such aggregate income." 5

'The. Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives reported with respect to the provision of the bill which became
the Revenue Act of 1921 as follows:
"Section 231 of the bill proposes to amend section 223 of the present law in such a manner as to clear up the doubt now existing as to
the right of husband and wife in all cases to make a joint return and
have the tax computed on the combined income." House Rep. No.

HELVERING v. JANNEY.
189

Opinion of the Court.

The question as to deductions for losses on sales or
exchanges of securities arose under § 23 (r) (1) of the
Revenue Act oft 1932.0 That provided that losses as
there described should be allowed only to the extent of
gains derived from such sales or exchanges. Nothing was
said in this section which in any way affected the provision of the statute as to joint returns by husband and
wife. The question in that relation, that is, as to deduction for losses on sales of securities, was submitted to
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and was answered
by him on December 29, 1932, as follows:
"The specific question presented is whether the loss
sustained by the husband may be applied to offset the
same amount of gain realized by the wife in rendering
joint income tax return for the year. In reply you are
advised that, in the case of a husband and wife living
together who file a joint income tax return, the tax liability is computed on the aggregate income as provided
by section 51 (b) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1932, and
such joint return is tre2Ked as if it was the return of a
single individual. The aggregate income in such case
would of course embrace the gains as well as the allowable
deductions of each spouse. If it is correctly understood
from your letter that the gains and losses in the illustration presented are from, transactions falling within the
same class within the meaning of the statute such as
sales of securities not held for a period of more than two
years, the loss sustained by the husband would offset the
same amount of gain realized by the. wife from such
source."
'47 Stat. 183.. Section 23 (r) (1) provided: "Losses from sales or
exchanges of stocks and bonds (as defined in subsection (t) of this
-section) which are not capital assets (as defined in section .101) shall
be allowed only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges
(including gains Which may be derived by a taxpayer from. the retirement of his own obligations)."

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

This statement by the Commissioner applied the same
principle which'.had previously been followed withrespect
to deductions in the joint returns of husband and wife,
there having been no indication by Congress of any different purpose.
Treasury Regulations No. 77., promulgated under the
Act of 1932, contained nothing to the contrary and the
regulation theretofore obtaining as to such joint returns
was left unchanged., Art. 381.
The Revenue Act of 1934 continued the prior statutory
provisions as to joint returns of husband and wife, and
§ 117 (d) of that Act, as to capital losses, did not purport
to alter the rule as to the right of the spouses to deductions in their joint'return. Section 117 (d) merely limited the amount of losses which could be deducted, as
follows:

. "(d) Limitation on Capital Losses.-Losses from sales
or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the
extent of $2,000 plus the gains from such 'sales or
exchanges."
The conclusion of the Commissioner with respect to
the Act of 1932, in the opinion above mentioned, was
equally applicable to the new Act.
It was not until 1935 that the Treasury Department
by Article 117-5 of Regulations 86 undertook to provide
that "the allowance of losses of one'spouse from sales or
exchanges of capital assets is in all cases to be computed
without
regard to gains and losses of the other spouse
upon sales
or exchanges of capital assets."

We are of the opinion that under the provision of the
Act of 1934 as to joint returns of husband and wife,
which embodied a policy set forth in substantially the
same terms for many years, Congress intended to provide
'It was also in 1935 that the Bureau of Internal Revenue announced the same ruling under the Act of 1932. G. C. M. 15438,.

Syllabus.

for a tax on the aggregate net income and that the losses
of one spouse might be deducted from the gains of the
other; and that this applied as well' to deductions for
capital losses as to other deductions. This, we think,
was the meaning of the provision of the Revenue Act
of 1934 when it was enacted, and it was subject to change
only by Congress, and not by the Department.
In No. 36, the judgment of the -Circuit Court of
Appeals is affirmed.
In No. 113, the judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further
proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

No. 183. Argued November 18, 1940.-Decided December 9, 1940.
1. A joint return by a husband and wife, under § 51 (b) of the
.Revenue Act of 1934, is -to be treated as a return of a taxable
unit and as though made by an individual. P. 197.
2. In computing the net income on a joint return of husband and

their aggregate gross income up to 15% of the aggregate net
income, c. 277, 48 Stat. 690, § 23 (o).. Pp. 197-198.
Treasury Regulations 62, under the Revenue Act
of Article
1921 is 401,
