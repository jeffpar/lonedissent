for a tax on the aggregate net income and that the losses
of one spouse might be deducted from the gains of the
other; and that this applied as well' to deductions for
capital losses as to other deductions. This, we think,
was the meaning of the provision of the Revenue Act
of 1934 when it was enacted, and it was subject to change
only by Congress, and not by the Department.

TAFT ET UX. v. HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF
INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 183. Argued November 18, 1940.-Decided December 9, 1940.
1. A joint return by a husband and wife, under § 51 (b) of the
.Revenue Act of 1934, is -to be treated as a return of a taxable
unit and as though made by an individual. P. 197.
2. In computing the net income on a joint return of husband and
wife, their combined charitable contributions are deductible from
their aggregate gross income up to 15% of the aggregate net
income, c. 277, 48 Stat. 690, § 23 (o).. Pp. 197-198.
Treasury Regulations 62, under the Revenue Act
of Article
1921 is 401,
consistent with this construction.
3. Article 23 (o), Treasury Regulations 86, which sought to require
a husband and wife, whether they make "a joint return or separate returns," to base their deduction for charitable contributions

CERIoRAmi, post, p. 628, to review a judgment which
affirmed a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals (40 B. T. A.
229) sustaining a deficiency assessment.
Mr. Clarence Castimore, with whom Mr. Henry W.
Taft was on the brief, for petitioners
Mr. Thomas E. Harris, with whom Attorney General
Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Maurice J. Mahoney were on the brief,
for respondent.
MR.CHimp JusTICE HUGH8s delivered the opinion of
the Court.
Petitioners, husband and wife, filed joint income-tax
returns for the years 1934 and 1935. In computing their
aggregate net income under § 51 (b) of the Revenue Act
of 1934,1 they made deductions of their combined charitable contributions2 The Commissioner ruled that the
deductions on account of the wife's charitable contribu-'
tions should be reduced to 15 per cent of her separate
net income and deficiences were determined accordingly.
The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner
(40 B. T. A. 229) and the Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed. 111 F. 2d 145.'
Because the question is cognate to that presented in
the cases of Helvering v. Janney, ante, p. 189, and Gaines
V.Helvering, ante, p. 189, we granted certiorari. October
14, 1940.
The provision for joint returns in § 51 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1934 was in.substantially the same form as the

Opinion of the Court.

corresponding provision in the prior revenue acts from
1921. The import of that provision is that in making
a joint return the husband and wife should report their
aggregate gross income and could combine their deductions in reporting their aggregate net income upon which
the tax was to be computed. That was the construction
placed upon the original provision for joint returns, in
the Revenue Act of 1918, by the Solicitor of Internal
Revenue. He said in his ruling: "If a single joint return is filed it is treated as the return of a taxable unit
and the net income disclosed by the return is subject to
both normal and surtax as though the return were that
of a single individual. In cases, therefore, in which the
husband or wife has allowable deductions in excess of
his or her gross income, such excess may, if joint return
is filed, be deducted from the net income of the other
for the purpose of computing-both the normal and surtax.',
We think that) this was the intention of Congress in enacting the Act of 1921 ' and the later acts
containing the same provision for joint returns. We
think that it was also the fair import of the Treasury
Regulations under the Act of 1921 and of subsequent
regulations prior to 1934.1
Respondent places emphasis on the phrasing of Article
401 of Regulations 62 under the Act of 1921, that "in a
single joint return, the tax is computed on the aggregate
income and all deductions and credits to which either is
entitled shall be taken from such aggregate income."
The argument stresses the words "to which either is entitled" and it is urged that each spouse is entitled only

to deduct 15 per cent of his or her separate net income.
But we think that this is an inadmissible construction of
the statute and is not a necessary construction of the
regulation. Such a construction is inconsistent with the
premise of the Solicitor's opinion, above mentioned, that
a joint return "is treated as the return of a taxable unit"
and the tax is to be laid as though the return were that
"of a single individual." The more specific language
of the provision in the Act of 1921, which for the present
purpose is the same as that in the Act'of 1934, affords
a stronger basis for this conclusion. It provides specifically for the inclu,%ion of the income of each spouse "in
a single joint return" and in that case that "the tax shall
be computed on the aggregate incohne." The principle
that the joint return is to be treated as the return of a
"taxable unit" and as though it were made by a "single
individual" would be violated if in making a joint return
each- spouse were compelled to calculate his or her charitable contributions as if he or she were making a separate
return. The principle of a joint return'permitted aggregation of income and deductions:-and thus overrode the
'limitations incident to separate rdii-ns. We find no indication in Article 401 of Regulations 62 under the Act
of 1921 of any intention to depart from the Solicitor's
view as to the purport of the statute.
In 1935, by Article 23' (o)-I of Treasury Regulations
86, the Department sought to require 'a husband and
tvife, whether they make "a joint return or 'separate returns," to base their deduction for charitable contributions on the separate net income of -the sppuse making
them. We are of the opinion that under the Revenue
Act of 1934, taken' with the meaning we think it had
when enacted, petitioners were entitled to the combined
deductions they claimed, and that the departmental regu-

Submitted November 18, 1940.-Decided December 9, 1940.

1. Sections 71. and 80, Title 28 U. S. C., 'were designed to prevent
delay over orders remanding causes. They entrust determination
to the informed judicial discretion of the District Court and cut
off review. P. 204.
2. A state Supreme Court, basing its determination exclusively on
the dflegations of a petition to remove, and concluding therefrom
that the cause involved a separable controversy between citizens
of different States, directed removal. The federal District Court,
basing its determination on the entire record, including new facts,
found that there was no separable controversy and that the plaintiff was an alien, and remanded the cause. Held:
(1) The District Court acted within its jurisdiction, pursuant
to §§ 71 and 80, Title 28, U. S. C. P. 204.
(2) The order of remand was not reviewable by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. P. 205.
