OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Syllabus.

311 U. S.

"Apart from the facts that appellant was privileged to
do business in California, and that the risks reinsured
were originally insured against in that state by companies also authorized to do business there, California
had no relationship to appellant or to the reinsurance
contracts. No act in the course of their formation, performandie or discharge, took place there. The performance of those acts was not dependent upon any privilege
or authority granted by it, and California laws afforded
'to them no protection."
And finally the court concluded:
"All that appellant did in effecting the reinsurance
was done without the state and for its transaction no
privilege or license by California was needful. The tax
cannot be sustained either as laid on property, business
done, or transactions carried on within the state, or as a
tax on a privilege granted by the state."
I think that the judgment below should be affirmed.

WISCONSIN v. MINNESOTA MINING CO. 453
Opinion of the Court.

452

CERTIORARI, 310 U. S. 619, to review the reversal of
a judgment which confirmed an order of the Wisconsin
Tax Commission assessing a tax.

Messrs. Harold H. Persons, Assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin, and James Ward Rector, Deputy Attorney General, with whom Mr. John E. Martin, Attorney General, was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. John L. Connolly, with whom Messrs. Frederick
J. Miller and G.. Burgess Ela were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JusTICE FRANKFURTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case, involving another application of the Wisconsin Privilege Dividend Tax considered in Wisconsin v.
J. C. Penney Co., ante, p. 435, is governed by that decision
except for a contention made by this respondent but not
pressed here in Penney's case.
The Commerce Clause is invoked. But it is too late
in the day to find offense to that Clause because a state
tax is imposed on corporate net income of an interstate
enterprise which is attributable to earnings within the
taxing state, Matson Navigation Co. v. State Board, 297
U. S. 441. That liability for such a tax is made con-.
tingent upon later happenings, as in the circumstances of
the present case, makes'no difference.
Reversed.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, MR.

JUSTICE ROBERTS, and MR. JUSTICE REED dissent for the
reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in Wisconsiniv.
J. C. Penney Co., ante, p. 446.
