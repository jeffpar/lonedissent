the word "retirement" is broader in meaning than the word
"redemption." P. 530.

Opinion of the Court.

Miss Helen R. Carloss, with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistan7 Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and J. Louis Monarch were on the brief, for
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

MR. JUSTICB ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases present the question whether upon the
surrender of bonds or debentures in exchange for a money
payment less than cost, a taxpayer may deduct the loss
from his gross income as a bad debt under § 23 (k) ' or
must treat it as a capital loss under § 117 (f) 2 of the
Revenue Act of 1934.
In number 55 it appears that the taxpayer owned
$15,000 par value of bonds of a water district, acquired by
gift. The district being in financial difficulties offered
to pay $7,476.75 for them. The offer was accepted and
the bonds delivered. In his tax return the taxpayer
claimed a deduction of $7,523.25 as for a bad debt charged
off. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, and
the -Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals 1 sustained his ruling.
In number 58 the facts are that the taxpayer bought
$25,000 par value of debentures for $24,750. The issuer's
affairs- were placed in the hands of a receiver. A plan of
reorganization provided that the receiver should pay
$5.09 for each $1000 debenture surrendered for cancellation. The taxpayer availed himself of this provision,
and in his tax return claimed a deduction of $24,625, as
for a bad debt. The Commissioner disallowed the claim,
'48 Stat. 689; 26 U. S. C. § 23 (k).
'48 Stat. 715;. 26 U. S. C. § 117 (f).

Opinion of the Court.

and the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed his decision. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.'
By reason of the conflict of decision we granted certiorari in both cases.
The earlier revenue acts contained sections similar to
23 (k) of the Act of 1934. They also embodied provisions for calculation of taxes on capital net gains. None
of theni included any section like 117 (f). Prior to the
adoption of the 1934 Act it had been held that the phrase
"sale or exchange'"of capital assets, employed in those
Acts, was not descriptive of the redemption or call for
repayment of corporate securities, and hence gain thereby
occasioned was to be treated as ordinary income,' and
loss so arising was to be deducted from gross income as a
bad debt.0
. The Revenue Act of 1934, by sub-section (f) of § 117,
provided that for the purposes of the title dealing with
capital gains and losses, "amounts received by the holder
upon the retirement" of such securities as are here involved, "shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor."
It is lain that Congress intended by the new subsection (f) to take out of the bad debt provision certain
transactions and to place them in the category of capital
gains.and losses. The question is whether by employing
the word "retirement" the transactions here involved
were so transferred. We hold that they were.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

"Retirement" aptly describes what occurred in the
instant cases. The statute does not use the word in an
unusual or artificial sense. In common understanding
and according to dictionary definition the word "retirement" is broader in scope than "redemption"; is not, as
contended, synonymous with the latter, but includes it.
Nothing in the legislative history of the provision .requires us to attribute to the term used a meaning narrower than its accepted meaning in common speech.
The taxpayer in number 58 urges that to hold subsection (f) applicable in his case would give the provision an unjust effect, since, if he had refused to surrender his debentures for the trifling consideration
offered, he could have charged off their whole cost as*
a bad debt under § 23 (k). The answer is that we must
apply the statute as we find it, leaving to Congress the
correction of asserted inconsistencies and inequalities in
its operation.
The court below held in number 58 that the phrase
"retirement" could properly be applied only to voluntary action on the debtor's part in fulfilment of his promise to pay. This is but to say that retirement means no
more than call and redemption pursuant to the terms of
the obligation. But as we have said, the two are not
in common understanding the same.
The judgment in number 55 is affirmed, and that in
number 58 is reversed.
No. 56, affirmed.
No. 68, reversed.
