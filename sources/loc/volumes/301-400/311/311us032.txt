HANSBERRY ET AL. v. LEE ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 29. Argued October 25, 1940.-Decided November 12, 1940.
Numerous owners of lots in a particular area agreed in writing, each
severally with each of the others, that their lots should not be
sold to or occupied by Negroes, the effectiveness of the agreement
being conditioned, however, upon signing by owners of a specified
percentage of the lot frontage. In a case in a state court, tried
upon an agreed statement of facts, in which it was stipulated (erroneously) that this condition had been complied with, and in
which the issue litigated was whether the agreement had ceased to
be enforceable in equity by reason of changes in the restricted
area, an owner of one of the lots, suing in behalf of himself and of
others in like situation, obtained a decree enjoining violation of
the agreement by four individuals, who asserted an interest in
the restricted land through another signer of the agreement, but
who were not treated by the pleadings or decree as representing
others or as foreclosing by their defense the rights of others, and
whose interest in defeating the contract did not appear to outweigh
their interest in sustaining it. Held:
1. That others who were privy to the agreement, but not made
parties to the litigation, and whose substantial ihterest was in
resisting performance of the agreement, could not be bound by the
decree upon the theory that the suit was a class suit in which
they were duly represented. Pp. 39, 44.
2. That a decree of the state court in a 'second, similar suit,
adjudging such other persons estopped by the former decree as res
judicata from defending upon the ground that the condition precedent of the agreement had not been fulfilled, was in violation of the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 40,-44.

Burke v. Kleiman; 277 Ill. App. 519, was not a class or

This Court in Wabash RailroadCo. v. Adelbert College,
208 U. S. 38, 58, has sounded a warning in respect to the
doctrine of res judicata in representative suits.
The holding pf the Burke v. Kleiman suit to be a representative suit and res judicata against the petitioners,
deprived the petitioners of the benefit of notice and a real
opportunity to defend. 'Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U. S.
274, 277.
A restrictive agreement between 500 or more different
property owners owning as many or more different and
dissimilar parcels of real estate can not be the subjectmatter of a class or representative suit, there being no
common res, no 'common subject matter, and no identity
of interest among them. In order to bring a representative suit there must be some common right, res, title
or common subject matter or identical interest in all of
the members of the class. See Smith v. Swormstedt, 16

A representative or class suit if permitted and sustained
in a case like this would destroy, essentially, all the personal defenses to which each owner is entitled, namely:
forgery of signatures, fraud and trickery in obtaining signatures, signing upon the condition that a certain number of other owners would sign, alteration of the instru-ment, laches, waiver, abandonment, estoppel, and change
in the character of the neighborhood which would render
inequitable the enforcement of the purported agreement.
Each individual party signatory is entitled to prove as to
these, not only in respect to himself but in respect to all
other purported parties signatory, by whom and with
whom he is sought to be bound. He is entitled to require
proof of or to disprove the existence of the agreement.
Mere number of parties does not sustain a representative or class suit. See Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S.

Petitioners contend that one member of a class may not
be sued by representatives of the class to enforce a common right. The reasoning that the interests of the person sued are necessarily in conflict with those of the class
would prevent all manner of class suits. Such is not the
law of Illinois, which considers all members of a class
having common rights needing protection bound by the
doctrine of res judicata in a proper representative suit.

MR. JusTIcE SToNE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question is whether the Supreme Court of Illois,
by its adjudication that petitioners in this case are bound
by a judgment rendered in an earlier litigation to which
they were not parties, has deorived them*of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Respondents brought this suit in the Circuit Court of
Cook County, Illinois, to enjoin the breach by petitioners
of an -agreement restricting the use of land within a described area of the City of Chicago, which was alleged to
have been entered into by some five hundred of the landowners. The agreement stipulated that for a specified
.period no part of the land should be "sold, leased to or
permitted to be occupied by any person nf the colored

race," and provided that it should not be effective unless
signed by the "owners of 95 per centum of the frontage"
withiii the described area. The bill of complaint set up
that the owners of 95 per cent of the frontage had signed;
that respondents are owners of land within the restricted
area who have either signed the agreement or acquired
their land from others who did sign; and that petitioners
Hansberry, who are Negroes, have, with the alleged aid of
the other petitioners and with knowledge of the agreement, acquired and are occupying land in the restricted
area formerly belongifig to an owner who had signed the
agreement.
To the defense that the agreement had never become
effective because owners of 95 per cent of the frontage
had not signed it, respondents pleaded that that issue was
res judicata by the decree in an earlier suit. Burke v.
Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519. To this petitioners pleaded,
by way of rejoinder, that they. were not parties to that
suit or bound by its decree, and that denial of their right
to litigate, in the present .suit, the issue of performance
of the condition precedent to the validity of the agreement would be a denial of due process of law guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment. It does not appear, nor
is it contended that any of petitioners is the successor in
interest to or in privity with any of the parties in the
earlier suit.
The circuit court, after a trial on the merits, found
that owners of only about 54 per cent of the frontage had
signed the agreement, and that the only support of the
judgment in the Burke case was a false and fraudulent
stipulation of the parties that owners of 95 per cent had
signed. But it ruled that the issue of performance of the
condition precedent to the validity of the agreement was
res judicataas alleged and entered a decree for respondents. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed. 372 Ill.

Opinion of -the Court.

The Supreme Court of Illinois, upon an examination
of the record in Burke v. Kleiman, supra, found that that
suit, in the Superior Court of Cook County, was brought
by a landowner in the restricted area to enforce the agreement, which had been signed by her predecessor in title,
in behalf of herself and other property owners in like
situation, against four named individuals, who had acquired or asserted an interest in a plot of land formerly
owned by another sigr.er of the agreement; that, upon
stipulation of the parties in that suit that the agreement
had been signed by owners of 95 per cent of all the frontage, the court had adjudged that the agreement was in
force, that it was a covenant running with the land and
binding all the land within the described area in the
hands of the parties to the agreement and those claiming under them, including defendants, and had entered
its decree restraining the breach of the agreement by the
defendants and those claiming under them, and that the
appellate court had affirmed the decree. It found that
the stipulation was untrue but held, contrary to the trial
court, that it was not fraudulent or collusive. It also
appears from the record in Burke v. Kleiman that the
case was tried on an agreed statement of facts which
raised only a single issue, whether by reason of changes
in the restricted area, the agreement had ceased to be
enforcible in equity.
From this the Supreme Court of Illinois concluded
in'the present case that Burke v. Kleiman was a "class"
or "representative" suit, and that in such a suit, "where
the remedy is pursued by a plaintiff who has the right
to represent the class to which he belongs, other members
of the class are bound by the results in the case unless
it is reversed or set aside on direct proceedings"; that
petitioners in the present suit were members of the class
represented by the plaintiffs in the earlier suit and consequently were bound by its decree, which had -rendered

311 U. S.

the issue of performance of. the condition precedent to
the restrictive agreement res judicata,so far as petitioners
are concerned. The court thought that the circumstance
that the stipulation in the earlier suit that owners of 95
per cent of the frontage had signed the agreement was
contrary to the fact, as found in the present suit, did
not militate against this conclusion, since the court in
the earlier suit had jurisdiction to determine the fact as
between the parties before it, and that its determination,
beqause of the representative character of the suit, even
th.ugh erroneous, was binding on petitioners until set
aside by a direct attack on the first judgment.
State courts are free to attach such depcriptive labels
to litigations before them as they may choose and to
attribute to them such consequences as they think appropriate under state constitutions and laws, subject only
to the requirements of the Constitution of the United
States. But when the judgment of a state court, ascribing to the judgment of another court the binding force
and effect of res judicata, is challenged for want of due
process it becomes the duty of this Court to examine
the course of procedure in both litigations to ascertain
,whether the litigant whose rights have thus been adjudicated has been afforded such notice and opportunity to
:be heard as are requisite to the due process which the
Constitution prescribes. Western Life Indemnity Co. v.
Rupp, 235 U. S. 261, 273.
It is a principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment
in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated
as a party or to which he bhas not been made a party
by service of process. Pen yer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714;

Fourteenth Amendments require. Postal Telegraph

To these' general rules there is a recognized exception
that, to an extent not precisely defined by judicial opinion, the judgment in a "class" or "representative" suit, to
which some members of the class are parties, may bind
members of the class or those represented who 'were not
made parties to it. Smith v. Sworm8tedt, 16 How. 288;
Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S. 531; Hartford Life
Ins. Co. v. Ibs, 237 U. S. 662; Hartford Life Ins. Co. v.
Barber, 245 U. S. 146; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v.
Cauble, 255 U. S. 356; cf. Christopherv. Brusselback, 302
U. S. 500.
The class suit was an invention of equity to enable
it to proceed to a decree in suits where the number of
those interested in the subject of the litigation is so great
that their joinder as parties in conformity to the usual
rules of procedure is impracticable. Courts are not infrequently called upon to proceed with causes in which
the number of those interested in the litigation is so
great as to make difficult or impossible the joinder of all
because some are not within the jurisdiction or because
their whereabouts is unknown or where if all were made
parties to the suit its continued abatement by the death
of some would prevent or unduly delay a decree. In
such cases where the interests of those not joined are of
the same class as the interests of those who are, and
where it is considered that the latter fairly represent
the former in the prosecution of the' litigation of the
issues in which all have a common interest, the court will

proceed to a decree. Brown v. Vermuden, Ch. Cas. 272;

Thompson, 16 Ves. Jr. 321; West v. Randall, Fed. Cas.

Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur
v. Cauble, supra; Story, Equity Pleading (2d ed.) § 98.
It is evident that the considerations which may induce
a court thus to proceed, despite a technical defect of
parties, may differ from those which must be taken into
account in determining whether the absent parties are
bound by the decree or, if it is adjudged that they are,
in ascertaining whether such an adjudication satisfies the
requirements of due process and of full faith and credit.
Nevertheless, there is scope within the framework of the
Constitution for holding in appropriate cases that a
judgment rendered in a class suit is res judicata"as to
members of the class who are not formal parties to the
suit. Here, as elsewhere, the Fourteenth Amendment
does not compel state courts or legislatures to adopt any
particular rule for establishing the conclusiveness of
judgments in class suits; cf. Brown v. New Jersey, 175
U. S. 172; Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278; United
Gas Public Service Co. v. Texas, 303 U. S. 123; Avery' v.
Alabama, 308 U. S. 444, 446, 447, nor does it compel'the
adoption of the particular rules thought by this Court
to be appropriate for the federal courts. With a proper
regard for divergent local institutions and interests, cf.
Jackson County v. United States, 308 U. S. 343, 351, this
Court is justified in saying that there has been a failure
of due process only in those cases where it cannot be said'
that the procedure adopted, fairly insures the protection
of the interests-of absent parties who are to be bound by
it. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226,
'235.
It is familiar doctrine of the federal courts that members of a class not present . -parties to the litigation

HANSBERRY v. LEE.

Opinion of the Court.

may be bound by the judgment where they are in fact
adequately represented by parties who are present, or
where they actually participate in the conduct of the
litigation in which members of the class are present as
parties, Plumb v. Goodnow's Administrator, 123 U. S.
560; Confectioners' Machinery Co. v. Racine Engine &Mach. Co., 163 F. 914; 170 F. 1021; Bryant Electric Co.
v. Marshall, 169 F. 426, Or where the interest of the
members of the class, some of whom are present as parties, is joint, or where for any other reason the relationship between the parties present and those who are absent
is such as legally to entitle. the former to stand in judgment for the latter. Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; cf.
Christopher v. Brusselback, supra, 503, 504, and cases
cited.
In all such cases, so far as it can be said'that the members of the class who are present are, by generally recognized rules of law, entitled to stand in judgment foi thos
who are not, we may assume for present purposes
that such' procedure affords a protection to the. parties
who are represented, though absent, which would satisfy
the requirements of due process and full faith and credit
See Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S. 516; Matin v.
Augedahl, 247 U. S. 142; Chandler v. Peketz, 297 U. S.
609. Nor do we find it necessary for the decision of
this case to say that, when the only circumstance defining
the class is that the determination of the rights of ifs
members turns upon a single issue of fact or law, a state
could not constitutionally adopt a procedure whereby
some of the members of the class could stand in judgrent
for all, provided that the procedure were so devised and
applied as to insure that those present are of the same.
class as those absent and that the litigation is so conducted as to insure the full and fair consideration of
the common issue. Compare New England Divinsios

44

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

311 U. S.

We decide only that the procedure and the course of
litigation sustained here by the plea of res judicata do
not satisfy these requirements.
The restrictive agreement did not purport to create a
joint. obligation or liability. If valid and effective its
promises were the several obligations of the signers and
those claiming under them. The promises ran severally to
every other signer. It is plain that in such circumstances
all those alleged to be bound by the agreement would not
constitute a single class in any litigation brought to enforce
it. Those who sought to secure its benefits by enforcing
it could not be said to be in the same class with or represent those whose interest was in resisting performance, for
the agreement by its terms imposes obligations and confers
rights on the owner of each plot of land who signs. it. If
those who thus seek .to secure .the benefits of the agreement
were rightly regarded by the state Supreme Court as constituting a class, it is evident that those signers or their
successors who are interested in challenging the validity
of the agreement and resisting its performance are not of
the same class in the sense that their interests are identical
so that any group who had elected to enforce rights conferred by the agreement could be said to be acting in the
interest of any others who were free to deny its obligation.
Because of the dual and potentially conflicting interests
of those who are putative parties to the agreement in compelling or resisting its performance, it is impossible to say,
solely because they are parties to it, that any two of them
are of the same class. Nor without more, and with the
due regard for the protection of the rights of absent parties
which" due process exacts, can some be permitted to stand
in judgment forall.
It ip. one thing to say that some members of a class
may represent other members in a litigation where the
sole and. conmon interest of the class in the litigation,
is either to assert a common right or to challenge an

HANSBERRY v. LEE.

Opinion of the Court.

asserted obligation. Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, supra; Groves v.
FarmersState Bank, 368 Ill. 35; 12 N. E. 2d 618. It is
quite another to hold that all those who are free alternatively either to assert- rights or to challenge them are
of a single class, so that any group, merely because it is
*of the class so constituted, may be deemed adequately
to represent any others of the class in litigating their
interests in either alternative. Such a selection of representatives for purposes of litigation, whose substantial interests are not necessarily or even probably the
same as those whom they are deemed to represent, does
not afford that protection to absent parties which due
process requires. The doctrine of representation of absent parties in a class suit has not hitherto been thought,
to go so far. See Terry v. Bank of Cape Fear,20 F. 777,
781; Weidenfeld v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 129 F. 305,
310; McQuillen v. National Cash Register Co., 22 F.
Supp. 867, 873, aff'd 112 F. 2d 877, 882; Brenner v. Title
Guarantee& Trust Co., 276 N. Y. 230; 11 N. E. 2d 890;
cf. Wabash R. Co. v. Adelbert College, ,208 U. S. 38;
Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 U. S. 413. Apart
from the opportunities it would afford for the fraudulent
and collusive sacrifice of the rights of absent parties, we
think that the representation in this case no more satisfies
the requirements of due process than a trial by a judicial
Officer who is in such situation that he may have an

The plaintiffs in the Burke case sought to compel performance of the agreement in behalf of themselves and
all others similarly situated. They did not designate the

attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that they
had assumed to exercise, and a responsibility which, in
view of their dual interests it does not appear that they
could rightly discharge.
Reversed.
