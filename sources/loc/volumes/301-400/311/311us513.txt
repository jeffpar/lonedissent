COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 62.

Argued December 12, 1940.-Decided January 6, 1941.

A loss sustained by a corporation upon foreclosure sale of its mortgaged property, held, in computing taxable income under the Revenue Act of 1934, deductible only to the limited extent allowed by
§§23 (j) and 117 (d) for losses from "sales" or exchanges of
capital assets. Helvering v. Hammel, ante, p. 504, followed.
P. 514.
110 F. 2d 614, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 310 U. S. 622, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals redetermining a
deficiency in income tax.

Mr. George P. Halperin, with whom Mr. Bernard S.
Barron was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Norman D. Keller, with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Mr. Sewall
Key were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a companion case to Helvering v. Hammel,
ante, p. 504.
The question is whether the loss suffered by petitioner
on foreclosure sale of his mortgaged property, acquired
for profit, may be deducted in full from gross income or
only to the extent provided by § 117 (d) of the 1934
Revenue Act. The statutory provisions involved are
those of the 1934 Act relating to capital gains or losses,
particularly "losses from sales or exchanges of capital
assets" considered in the Hammel case which are made
applicable to petitioner, a corporation, by § 23 (f) (j).

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Syllabus.

311 U. S.

The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that petitioner's loss
was deductible in full from its ordinary income. The
court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the Board;
110 F. 2d 614, holding that the loss sustained by petitioner was a loss from a sale of capital assets, § 23 (j),
Which under § 117 (d) could be deducted from the gross
income only to the extent of capital gains, plus $2,000.
We granted certiorari, 310 U. S. 622, so that the case
might be considered with the conflicting decision of the
court of appeals for the sixth circuit in the Hammel case,
108 F. 2d 753. For the reasons stated in our opinion
in the Hammel case we think that this case was rightly
decided below.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS dissents.

H. J. HEINZ COMPANY v. NATIONAL LABOR
RELATIONS BOARD.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 73. Argued December 17, 18, 1940.-Decided January 6, 1941.
1. The question of the responsibility of an employer, under the
National Labor Relations Act, 'for unauthorized activities of supervisory employees is not one of legal liability :on principles of agency
or respondeat superior, but only whether the Act condemns such
activities as unfair labor, practices so far as the employer may
gain from them in the bargaining process any advafitage of a kind
which the Act proscribes. To that extent the employer is amenable
to the Board's authority to prevent repetition of such activities
and to remove the consequences of them upon the employees' right
of.self-organization. Pp. 518, 521.
So held where the employer, when advised of activities of supervisory employees encouraging the formation of a plant union, took
no step to notify the employees that such activities were unauthorized, or to correct their impression that support of a rival
labor union was not favored by the employer and would result
in reprisals. P. 521.
