HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. OWENS ET AL.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 180. Argued December 9, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.
1. Under the Revenue Acts of 1932 and 1934, the basis for determining the amount of a loss sustained during the taxable year,
arising from damage by casualty to property not used in the
taxpayer's trade or business (as to which class of property no
annual deductions for depreciation are allowed), is not the cost
of the property but its value immediately before the casualty.
P. 471.
2. In computing under the Revenue Act of 1934 the amount of the
deduction for losses sustained during the taxable year from the
sale or other disposition of property, § 113 (b) (1) (B)-and the
corresponding provision of the 1932 Act-must be read as a
limitation upon the amount of the deduction so that it may not
exceed cost, and in the case of depreciable nonbusiness property
may not exceed the amount of the loss actually sustained in the
taxable year, mieasured by the then depreciated value of the
property. P. 471.
95 F. 2d 318, reversed.
97 F. 2d 431, affirmed.

HELVERING v. OWENS.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Norman D. Keller, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs.
Sewall Key, Paul A. Freund, and W. Croft Jennings and
Louise Foster were on the briefs, for the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue.
Mr. Ewing Everett, with whom Mr. 0. H. Chmillon
was on the briefs, for respondents in No. 180 and petitioners in No. 318.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The courts below have given opposing answers to the
question whether the basis for determining the amount
of a loss sustained during the taxable year through injury to property not used in a trade or business, and
therefore not the subject of an annual depreciation allowance, should be original cost or value immediately
before the casualty.' To resolve this conflict we granted
certiorari in both cases.
In No. 180 the facts are that the respondent Donald
H. Owens purchased an automobile at a date subsequent
to March 1, 1913, and prior to 1934, for $1825, and used
it for pleasure until June 1934 when it was damaged in
a collision. The car was not insured. Prior to the accident its fair market value was $225; after that event
the fair market value was $190. The respondents filed
a joint income tax return for the calendar year 1934 in
which they claimed a deduction of $1635, the difference
between cost and fair market value after the casualty.
The Commissioner reduced the deduction to $35, the difference in market value before and after the collision.
The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the taxpayers' claim
and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its ruling.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

In No. 318 it appears that the taxpayers acquired a
boat, boathouse, and pier in 1926 at a cost of $5,325. In
August 1933 the property, which had been used solely
for pleasure, and was uninsured, was totally destroyed
by a storm. Its actual value immediately prior to destruction was $3905. The taxpayers claimed the right
to deduct cost in the computation of taxable income.
The Commissioner allowed only value at date of destruction. The Board of Tax Appeals held with the taxpayers but the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's
ruling.
Decision in No. 180 is governed by the Revenue Act of
1934;2 in No. 318 by the Revenue Act of 19322

The

provisions of both statutes touching the question presented are substantially the same and we shall refer only
to those of the 1934 Act. Section 23 (e) (3) permits deduction from gross income of losses "of property not connected with the trade or business" of the taxpayer, "if
the loss arises from . . .casualty."

Subsection (h) de-

clares that "The basis for determining the amount of
deduction for losses sustained, to be allowed under subsection (e) . . ., shall be the adjusted basis provided in

section 113 (b)." Section 113 is entitled "Adjusted basis
for determining gain or loss"; in subsection (a) it provides
that "The basis of property shall be the cost of such
property," with exceptions not material. Subsection (b),
to which 23 (h) refers, is: "Adjusted basis.-The adjusted
basis for determining the gain or loss from the sale or
other disposition of property, whenever acquired, shall be
the basis determined under subsection (a), adjusted as
hereinafter provided. (1) General rule.-Properadjustment in respect of the property shall in all cases be made(B) in respect of any period since February 28, 1913, for

Opinion of the Court.

exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and
depletion, to the extent allowed (but not less than the
amount allowable) under this Act or prior income tax
laws."
The income tax acts have consistently allowed deduction for exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence only
in the case of "property used in the trade or business."
The taxpayers in these cases could not, therefore, have
claimed any deduction on this account for years prior to
that in Which the casualty occurred. For this reason they
claim they may deduct upon the unadjusted basis,-that
is,-cost. As the income tax laws call 'for accounting on
an annual basis; as they provide for deductions for "losses
sustained during the taxable year"; as the taxpayer is
not allowed annual deductions for depreciation of nonbusiness property; as § 23 (h) requires that the deduction shall be on "the adjusted basis provided in section
113 (b)," thus contemplating an adjustment of value
consequent on depreciation; and as the property involved
was subject to depreciation and of less value in the taxable
year, than its original cost, we think § 113- (b) (1) (B)
must be read as a limitation upon the amount of the deduction so that it may not exceed cost, and in the case of
depreciable non-business property may not exceed the
amount of the loss actually sustained in the taxable year,
measured by the then depreciated value of the property.
The Treasury rulings have not been consistent, but this
construction is the one which has finally been adopted.4
In No. 180 judgment reversed.
In No. 318 judgment affirmed.
