HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. CHESTER N. WEAVER CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 304.

Argued November 17, 1938.-Decided December 5, 1938.

Payments received by a corporation as a stockholder in another
corporation, upon the latter's complete liquidation, are to be treated
as payments upon a sale or exchange of the stock under § 23 (r)
(1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, which allows the deduction of
losses from sales or exchanges of stock, not held for more than two
years, only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges.
P. 295.
Section 23 (f) provides that losses sustained by corporations during
the taxable year shall be allowed as deductions in computing net
income, subject to the limitations provided in subsection (r); subsection (r) (1) declares that losses from "sales or exchanges" of
stock which are not "capital assets" (as defined in § 101, i. e., property held by the taxpayer for more than two years) shall be allowed only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges.
Sections 115 and 112 accord to losses on liquidation the same
recognition accorded by § 23 (r) to losses upon sales. Cf. White v.
United States, ante, p. 281. P. 295.
97 F. 2d 31, reversed.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 585, to review a judgment reversing

an order of the Board of Tax Appeals, 35 B. T. A. 514,
sustaining an additional income tax.
Mr. Edward J. Ennis, with whom Solicitor General
Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and Messrs.
J. Louis Monarch and A. F. Prescott were on the brief, for
petitioner.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

Mr. Adolphus E. Graupner,with whom Mr. Arthur E.
Cooley was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question to be decided is whether payments received by a corporation as a stockholder in another corporation, upon the latter's complete liquidation, are to
be treated as payments upon a sale or exchange of the
stock under § 23 (r) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47
Stat. 169, which allows the deduction of losses from sales
or exchanges of stock, not held for more than two years,
only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges.
On August 9, 1932, respondent, a California corporation, purchased shares of stock in another corporation.
In the following year the latter was completely liquidated.
The liquidating dividends received by respondent
amounted to less than the cost of the stock. In its income tax return for 1933 respondent deducted the full
amount of the loss from gross income. The commissioner
ruled that, since the loss was sustained upon an exchange
of stock held less than two years and the respondent had
received no gains against which the loss could be applied,
the deduction was forbidden by § 23 (r) (1), and he
found a deficiency accordingly. The order of the Board
of Tax Appeals sustaining the deficiency was reversed by
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 97 F. 2d 31.
We granted certiorari, October 10, 1938, to resolve the
conflict between the decision of the court below and that
of the Court of Claims in White v. United States, 86 Ct.
Cls. 125; 21 F. Supp. 361, this day affirmed on certiorari,
ante, p. 281.
Section 23 (f) provides that losses sustained by corporations during the taxable year shall be allowed as deductions in computing net income, subject to the limi-

tations provided in-sub-section (r). Sub-section (r) (1)
declares:
"Losses from sales or exchanges of stocks and bonds . . .
which are not capital assets (as defined in section 101)
shall be allowed only to the extent of the gains from
such sales or exchanges..." By § 101 "'Capital assets'
means property held by the taxpayer for more than two
years . . .
Since the loss sustained by respondent was not from the
sale or exchange of the stock, it is contended that subsection (r) has no application and that the loss is deductible in full, as are other losses, under § 23 (f). Whether
§ 23 (f) or 23 (r) applies must be answered by deciding
whether, under § 115 (c), stockholders' losses upon a
corporate liquidation are to be treated, for purposes of
computation of the tax, in the same manner as losses
upon a sale or exchange of the stock.
The scheme of the 1932 Act, as respects the treatment
of gains and losses upon the sale or exchange of property
on a different basis from other types of gain or loss, is
substantially that of the 1928 Act, which we have considered in White v. United States, supra. The provisions of §§ 12 (c), 22 (d), (e), 23, 101, 111, 112, 113 and
115 (c) of the 1928 Act, discussed in the White case, so
far as now relevant were re~naeted in the same numbered
sections of the 1932 Act. The considerations which in
that case led us to the conclusion that § 115 (c) of the
1928 Act had placed stockholders' gains and losses from
liquidations on the same basis as gains and losses from
sales of the stock for purposes of computation of the tax,
lead us to the same conclusion with respect to the 1932
Act.
We find nothing in the language or history of § 23 (r)
to suggest that Congress, in enacting it, had any purpose

to restrict the operation of § 115 (c) as we have construed
it. Section 23 (r), like § 101 in the 1932 and earlier
Acts, speaks of losses resulting only from sales or exchanges. But the one does not more than the other
restrict the operation of the provisions of §§ 115 and 112,
which accord to losses on liquidation the same recognition accorded by § 23 (r) to losses upon sales. Congress,
in enacting the 1934 Act, recognized that under that of
1932 ". . a distribution in liquidation of a corporation
is treated in the same manner as a sale of stock." Report of Senate Committee on Finance, No. 558, 73rd
Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 37. To prevent avoidance of surtax
through liquidation of corporations with large surpluses,
Congress found it necessary to place gains on liquidations on a different basis from gains on sales. It accomplished this by amending § 115 (c) to provide:
"Despite the provisions of section 117 (a) [corresponding
to § 101 in the earlier Acts specially taxing capital gains
and losses] 100 per centum of the gain so recognized
shall be taken into account in computing net income."
48 Stat. 711.
It follows that the extent to which the taxpayer can
deduct the loss is controlled by § 23 (r) (1), and that
since the stock was held for less than two years and
there were no gains against which the loss could be offset,
it can not be deducted from gross income.
Reversed.
