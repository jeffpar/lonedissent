CHIPPEWA INDIANS v. U. S.
Counsel for Parties.

CHIPPEWA INDIANS OF MINNESOTA v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 244.

Argued December 9, 12, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.

1. The Act of May 23, 1908, which created a national forest of
lands then held by the Government in trust for the Chippewa
Tribe of Indians and provided for payments of compensation to
the Indians including the value of timber to be appraised, was a
complete taking at the time the Act became effective, and the value
of such timber is determined as of the date of the Act rather than
as f the time of the making and approval of the appraisal, many
years later. P. 480.
2. The legislation conferring on the Court of Claims jurisdiction to
adjudicate all legal and equitable claims of the Chippewa Indians
of Minnesota arising under or growing out of the Act of January
14, 1889, or arising under or growing out of any subsequent Act
of Congress in relation to Indian affairs, did not include a claim
on account of land alleged to have been excluded from Indian
reservations through erroneous public surveys in 1872-1885 and
to have been appropriated and sold by the Government, before
the Act of 1889 was passed. P. 483.
The terms of the Act of 1889 were restricted to the Chippewa
reservations then existing (1889) in Minnesota. None of the
subsequent Acts, relating to Indian affairs, upon which the Indians rely expanded the provisions of the 1889 Act so as to include Congressional treatment of the transactions made the basis
of this claim.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Chippewa Indians filed suit in the Court of Claims
asserting two separate claims against the government.
The government pleaded offsets greatly in excess of the
claims of the Tribe. Dismissing the Tribe's petition as
to both its claims,' the Court found it unnecessary to pass
upon the government's offsets, and therefore denied them
without prejudice. The cause is here on appeal by virtue
of a Special Act of Congress requiring our review of the
judgment of the Court of Claims.!
As to the first claim. A Congressional Act of May 23,
1908, created a National Forest upon lands then in
possession of the United States but held bythe government as a trustee for the benefit of the Chippewa Indian
Tribe.' This Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to "proceed with the sale of the merchantable pine
timber" upon certain of these lands; and provided for an
appraisal "forthwith" of the timber on the lands; for payment to the Indians of the appraised value plus payments
received from the sale of any timber by the Secretary of
the Interior prior to the appraisal; and for payment to the
Tribe of $1.25 per acre for all of the lands appropriated.
Appraisal was not made "forthwith," but in 1922. In
1908, when the Act was passed, certain types of the timber
were not "merchantable" and had no value. By 1923,
however, when the appraisal was completed and approved,
these particular timbers were appraised at $1,060,887.07.
In view of the long delay in making the appraisal and
payment, approximately $490,000 in interest was appropriated for the benefit of the Tribe in 1926. The
Court of Claims construed the 1908 Act as an appropriation of the lands and timber for a public use at the date of

Opinion of the Court.

enactment, and finding the timbers in question without a
merchantable value at that time, decided against the
Tribe on this claim.
The sole question raised by appellants' assignment of
error with reference to this first claim attacks the Court of
Claims' holding-based on its construction of the Act of
1908-that the appropriation of the Tribe's land and timber was effected by that Act and as of the date of the Act,
and that court's failure to hold that the appropriation occurred when the timber was appraised and the appraisal
approved in April, 1923.
The findings do not show as clearly as might be desired
that the timber was without merchantable value in 1908.
However, there is a complete absence of any controversy
on this point, and appellants were not denied the right to
introduce evidence to establish the value of the property.
When these findings are considered with the pleadings and
are clarified by the opinion of the court below, all possible
doubt as to their meaning disappears, and they show that
the Court found a lack of any merchantable value in
1908.4
Actual appropriation of the land or timber by the
United States is admitted. Just compensation for the
property appropriated must be its value as of the date
when the Tribe's interest in the property was taken.' It
is agreed that until the passage of the Act of 1908 the
government held possession of the land and timber as
trustee for the Tribe. Under the trust the government
was charged with disposal of the property for the benefit
of the Tribe. If the Act of 1908 actually deprived the
Tribe of its beneficial interest in the property, the Act

represented an exercise of the power of eminent domain
and vested-when enacted-complete title in the government. This would be an appropriation-a complete taking of property-at the time the Act became effective.6
We need look no further than the language of this
Act to ascertain its effect. The very first words after the
enacting clause are " . . . there is hereby created in the
State of Minnesota a national forest consisting of lands
and territory described as follows, . .." There follows a
description of the lands in question by metes and bounds.
Throughout the Act there are repeated declarations referring to the National Forest "hereby created." It
would have been difficult for Congress to have selected
language more clearly expressing the intent and purpose
to deprive the Tribe completely-by the Act-of all its
remaining beneficial interest in the property.
Appellants urge that appropriation of the property did
not take place until the appraisal of the timber was approved in 1923. In support of this contention they rely
chiefly upon the following provisions of ยง 5 of the Act:
"... all moneys received from the sale of timber from
any of the land set aside by this Act for a National Forest, prior to the appraisal herein provided for . . . shall
be placed to the credit of the Chippewa Indians in the
State of Minnesota ...and after said appraisal the National Forest hereby created, as above described, shall
be subject to all general laws and regulations . ..governing national forests, . . ." But this provision by its
very terms characterizes the property as "the National
Forest hereby created" and directs disposition of "all
moneys received from the sale of timber from any of the
land set aside by this Act for a National Forest, . . ."
(italics supplied). The fact that the lands were not to

Opinion of the Court.

be subjected to the general laws and regulations governing National Forests until after the appraisal was made
indicates no congressional intent to delay the creation of
the National Forest. The government already had legal
title to, and possession of the property, and the Act contemplated that the appraisal should be made "forthwith." Since the Tribe was to be paid the appraised
value of all the timber, the Act appropriately provided
that proceeds for sales of any timber sold before appraisal
should be paid to the Tribe.
Upon examination of the Act we are of the opinion
that the Court of Claims correctly decided that the appropriation of the land and timber occurred in 1908,
when the Act became the law, and that accordingly it
properly dismissed the claim.
Second. The jurisdictional Act under which the petition in this cause was filed 7 conferred jurisdiction upon
the Court of Claims "to hear, examine, and adjudicate and
render judgment in any and all legal and equitable claims
arising under or growing out of the Act of January 14,
1889 .. ., or arising under or growing out of any subsequent Act of Congress in relation to Indian affairs which
said Chippewa Indians of Minnesota may have against
the United States, . . ." Appellants' second claim was
based upon allegations that the government made erroneous surveys of Indian lands between and including the
years 1872 and 1885; that these errors resulted in wrongfully excluding the lands from Indian reservations; and
that the government thereafter appropriated and sold
these lands (some of which belonged to appellants) before
the Act of 1889 was passed. Inspection of the 1889 Act 1
discloses that none of its provisions related to these lands

Stat. 423) and June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 979).

previously disposed of by the government. Its terms
were restricted to the Chippewa reservations then existing
(1889) in Minnesota. None of the subsequent Acts, relating to Indian affairs, upon which appellants rely I
expanded the provisions of the 1889 Act so as to include
Congressional treatment of the transactions made the
basis of this second claim. Since this second claim did
not arise from or grow out of the 1889 Act or subsequent
Acts, the Court of Claims properly dismissed for want
of jurisdiction.

ACCIDENT ASSN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 189.

Submitted December 12, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.

1. A health and accident policy (governed by the law of Arkansas),
issued and effective December 31, 1926, and reciting and providing that it is issued "in consideration of . . .the payment in
advance of $74.00 the first year" and that "the payment in advance of ... $16.00 quarterly thereafter, beginning with April
1, 1927, is required to keep this policy in continuous effect,"construed as meaning and intending that the payment in advance
of $74.00 would keep the policy in force until December 31, 1927,
and that payment of $16.00 April 1, 1927, would extend the policy
a quarterly period beyond December 31, 1927, and that successive payments of $16.00 at the beginning -of each quarter following the quarter beginning April 1, 1927, would extend the policy
correspondingly.. P. 488.
2. Delivery of the policy containing the recital that it "is issued in
consideration of . . .the payment in advance of $74.00" established prima facie the fact of advance payment of that amount.
