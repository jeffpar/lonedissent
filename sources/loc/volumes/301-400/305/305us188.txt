LYETII v. HOEY, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 48. Argued November 16, 1938.-Decided December 5, 1938.
1. Property received by an heir under an agreement compromising
and settling his contest of the decedent's will, is property acquired
by "inheritance," within the meaning of § 22 (b) (3) of the
Revenue Act of 1932, which exempts the value of such property
from the income tax. P. 191.
2. This question is not determined by the local law, but is a federal
question, in deciding which the language of the Revenue Law
should be so construed as to give uniform application to a nationwide scheme of taxation. P. 193.
Congress establishes its own criteria and the state law may control only when the federal taxing Act by express language or
necessary implication makes its operation dependent upon state
law.
3. The claimant in this case was concededly an heir contesting the
will. The decree of probate admitting the will also required that
the estate be distributed in accordance with the compromise agreement. In so far as it provided for distribution to heirs the agreement overrode the will. The portion so obtained by the claimant
came not through the will, but because of his heirship. The fact
that he received less than the amount of his claim did not alter its
nature or the quality of its recognition through the distribution
which he did receive. What he got from the estate came to him
because he was heir, the compromise serving to remove pro tanto
the impediment to his inheritance. P. 195.
96 F. 2d 141, reversed; 20 F. Supp. 619, affirmed.

respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
.The question presented is whether property received
by petitioner from the estate of a decedent in comproinise of his claim as an heir is taxable as income under
the Revenue Act of 1932.
Petitioner is a grandson of Mary B. Longyear who died
in 1931, a resident of Massachusetts, leaving as her heirs
four surviving children and the petitioner and his brother,
who were sons of a deceased daughter. By her will, the
decedent gave to her heirs certain small legacies and the
entire residuary estate, amounting to more than $3,000,000, was bequeathed to trustees of a so-called Endowment Trust, created April 5, 1926, the income from which
was payable to another set of trustees under another
trust described as the Longyear Foundation. The main
purpose of the latter trust was to preserve "the records
of the earthly life of Mary Baker Eddy," the founder of
the Christian Science religion.
When the will was offered for probate in Massachusetts there was objection by the heirs upon the grounds,
among others, of lack of testamentary capacity and undue
influence. After hearing, at which a statement was made
by the respective parties of their proposed evidence, the
probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues
for trial before a jury. In that situation a compromise
agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees and the executors under the will, and
the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement
provided that the will should be admitted to probate
and letters testamentary issued; that the specific and

pecuniary bequests to individuals should be enforced;
that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $200,000 should
be paid to the heirs and a like amount to the Endowment
Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined,
should be equally divided between the trustees of the
Endowment Trust and the heirs. The net residue to
which the heirs were thus entitled was to be payable
in units of stock owned by the decedent in certain corporations, Longyear Estate, Inc., Longyear Corporation
and Longyear Realty Corporation, and for that purpose a
unit was to consist of three shares, one share of each
corporation.
The compromise was approved by the probate court
pursuant to a statute of Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Laws
1932, c. 204, § § 15-17) and a decree was entered on April
26, 1932, admitting the will to probate, issuing letters
testamentary to the executors and directing them "to administer the estate of said deceased in accordance with
the terms of said will and said agreement of compromise."
Owing to the Depression and the necessity of discharging
pecuniary legacies amounting to about $300,000, which
were entitled to priority in payment before distribution
of the residue, the heirs undertook to finance one-half of
these legacies and the residuary legatees the other onehalf. For this purpose the heirs formed a corporation
known as Longyear Heirs, Inc., to which they assigned
their interests in the estate in exchange for common stock.
Preferred stock was issued to the pecuniary legatees.
In.July, 1933, the executors distributed to Longyear
Heirs, Inc., as assignee of the petitioner, his distributable
share of the estate consisting of $80.17 in cash and a certificate of deposit for 358 units, each unit representing one
share of each of the three corporations mentioned in the
compromise agreement. The Commissioner of Internal
Revenue valued this distributable share at $141,484.03

and treated the whole amount as income for the year
1933 in which it was received. An additional tax of $56,389.65 was assessed, which petitioner paid in October,
1936, with interest. Claim for refund was then filed and
on its rejection this suit was brought against the collector.
On motion of petitioner the District Court entered a
summary judgment in his favor, 20 F. Supp. 619, which
the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 96 F. 2d 141. Because of a conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit in Magruderv. Segebade,
94 F. 2d 177, certiorari was granted.
The Court of Appeals overruled the contentions of petitioner that the property he received was within the statutory exemption (§ 22 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of
1932) and, further, that the property was not income
either under the statute or under the Sixteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. As the view of the
Court of Appeals upon these questions determined the
rights of the parties, it was found unnecessary to discuss
certain affirmative defenses set up by the answer of the
respondent and these defenses are not pressed in this
court.
First. By §22 (b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1932, there
is exempted from the income tax"The value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance ..."
Whether property received by an heir from the estate of
his ancestor is acquired by inheritance, when it is distributed under an agreement settling a contest by the
heir of the validity of the decedent's will, is a question
upon which state courts have differed. The question
has arisen in the application of state laws of taxation.
In Massachusetts, the rule is that when a will is admitted
to probate under a compromise agreement, the state succession tax is applied to the property "that passes by
the terms of the will as written and not as changed by

any agreement for compromise." Baxter v. Treasurer,
209 Mass. 459, 463; 95 N. E. 854, 856. Although under
the Massachusetts statute relating to compromise I it is
the practice to insert a clause in the court's decree that
the estate is to be administered in accordance with the
agreement, "yet the rights of the parties so far as they
rest upon the agreement are contractual and not testamentary." Ellis v. Hunt, 228 Mass. 39, 43; 116 N. E.
956. See, also, Brandeis v. Atkins, 204 Mass. 471, 474; 90
N. E. 861; Copeland v. Wheelwright, 230 Mass. 131, 136;
119 N. E. 667. Thus, when a contest was withdrawn
under a compromise and the residuary estate was divided
equally between the legatee and the heirs, it was held that
the tax was properly levied upon the entire residuary
legacy and that the administrators with the will annexed had no right to pay out of the share transferred
to the heirs one-half of the tax thus collectible from the
legatee unless the compromise agreement expressly or
impliedly so provided. Brown v. McLoughlin, 287 Mass.
15, 17; 190 N. E. 795. Several States have a similar
rule.2 In other States the amount received by an heir
under an agreement compromising a contest of his ancestor's will is considered to be received by virtue of his
heirship and is subject to an inheritance tax unless the
statute exempts him.'

Opinion of the Court.

In the instant case, the Court of Appeals applied the
Massachusetts rule, holding that whether the property

was received by way of inheritance depended "upon the
law of the jurisdiction under which this taxpayer received it."

We think that this ruling was erroneous.

The question as to the construction of the exemption
in the federal statute is not determined by local law. We
are not concerned with the peculiarities and special incidences of state taxes or with the policies they reflect.
Undoubtedly the state law determines what persons are
qualified to inherit property within the jurisdiction.
Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493; Maxwell v. Bugbee,
250 U. S. 525, 536, 537. The local law determines the
right to make a testamentary disposition of such property and the conditions essential to the validity of wills,
and the state courts settle their construction. Uterhartv.
United States, 240 U. S. 598, 603. The State establishes
the procedure governing the probate of wills and the
processes of administration. Petitioner's status as heir
was thus determined by the law of Massachusetts. That
law also regulated the procedure by which his rights as
an heir could be vindicated. The state law authorized its
courts to supervise the making of agreements compromising contests by heirs of the validity of an alleged will
of their ancestor, in order that such compromises shall
be just and reasonable with respect to all persons in
interest.' But when the contestant is an heir and a valid
compromise agreement has been made and there is a distribution to the heir from the decedent's estate accordingly, the question whether what the heir has thus received has been "acquired by inheritance" within the
meaning of the federal statute necessarily is a federal
question. It is not determined by local characterization.

R. I. 355; 43 A. 844.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

In dealing with the meaning and application of an act
of Congress enacted in the exercise of its plenary power
under the Constitution to tax income and to grant exemptions from that tax, it is the will of Congress which
controls, and the expression of its will, in the absence of
language evidencing a different purpose, should be interpreted "so as to give a uniform application to a nationwide scheme of taxation." Burnet v. Harmel, 287
U. S. 103, 110. Congress establishes its own criteria and
the state law may control only when the federal taxing
act by express language or necessary implication makes
its operation dependent upon state law. Burnet v. Harmel, supra. See Burk-Waggoner Oil Assn. v. Hopkins,
269 U. S. 110, 111, 114; Weiss v. Wiener, 279 U. S. 333,
337; Morrissey v. Commissioner, 296 U. S. 344, 356.
Compare Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U. S. 55, 59; Poe v.
Seaborn, 282 U. S. 101, 109, 110; Blair v. Commissioner,
300 U. S. 5, 9, 10. There is no such expression or necessary implication in this instance. Whether what an heir
receives from the estate of his ancestor through the compromise of his contest of his ancestor's will should be regarded as within the exemption from the federal tax
should not be decided in one way in the case of an heir
in Pennsylvania or Minnesota and in another way in the
case of an heir in Massachusetts or New York,' according
to the differing views of the state courts. We think that
it was the intention of Congress in establishing this exemption to provide a uniform rule.
Second. In exempting from the income tax the value of
property acquired by "bequest, devise, or inheritance,"
Congress used comprehensive terms embracing all acquisitions in the devolution of a decedent's estate. For the
word "descent," as used in the earlier acts,' Congress sub'See Notes 2 and 3.
'See Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, § II, 38 Stat. 167; Revenue
Acts of 1918, 1921 and 1924, § 213 (b) (3).

LYETH v. HOEY.

Opinion of the Court.

stituted the word "inheritance" in the 1926 Act and the
subsequent revenue acts as "more appropriately including both real and personal property."' Thus the acquisition by succession to a decedent's estate whether real
or personal was embraced in the exemption. Further, by
the "estate tax," Congress has imposed a tax upon the
transfer of the entire net estate of every person dying after
September 8, 1916,8 allowing such exemptions as it sees
fit in arriving at the net estate. Congress has not indicated any intention to tax again the value of the property which legatees, devisees or heirs receive from the decedent's estate.
Petitioner was concededly an heir of his grandmother
under the Massachusetts statute. It was by virtue of that
heirship that he opposed probate of her alleged will which
constituted an obstacle to the enforcement of. his right.
Save as heir he had no standing. Seeking to remove that
obstacle, he asserted that the will was invalid because of
want of testamentary capacity and undue influence. In
accordance with local practice, he asked the probate court
to frame these issues for a jury trial. It then became
necessary for him to satisfy the court that the issues were
substantial. Issues are not to be framed unless it appears from statements by counsel of expected evidence
or otherwise that there is a "genuine question of fact supported by evidence of such a substantial nature as to afford ground for reasonable expectation of a result favorable to the party requesting the framing of issues."
Briggs v. Weston, - Mass. -; 2 N. E. 2d 466; Smith
v. Patterson, 286 Mass. 356; 190 N. E. 536. Petitioner
satisfied that condition and the probate court directed the
framing of jury issues. It was in that situation, facing a
trial of the issue of the validity of the will, that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

compromise was made by which the heirs, including the
petitioner, were to receive certain portions of the decedent's estate.
There is no question that petitioner obtained that portion, upon the value of which he is sought to be taxed,
because of his standing as an heir and of his claim in that
capacity. It does not seem to be questioned that if the
contest had been fought to a finish and petitioner had
succeeded, the property which he would have received
would have been exempt under the federal act. Nor is it
questioned that if in any appropriate proceeding, instituted by him as heir, he had recovered judgment for a
part of the estate, that part would have been acquired
by inheritance within the meaning of the act. We think
that the distinction sought to be made between acquisition through such a judgment and acquisition by a compromise agreement in lieu of such a judgment is too
formal to be sound, as it disregards the substance of the
statutory exemption. It does so, because it disregards the
heirship which underlay the compromise, the status which
commanded that agreement and was recognized by it.
While the will was admitted to probate, the decree also
required the distribution of the estate in accordance with
the compromise and, so far as the latter provided for
distribution to the heirs, it overrode the will. So far as
the will became effective under the agreement it was because of the heirs' consent and release and in consideration of the distribution they received by reason of their
being heirs. Respondent agrees that the word "inheritance" as used in the federal statute is not solely applicable
to cases of complete intestacy. The portion of the decedent's property which petitioner obtained under the compromise did not come to him through the testator's will.
That portion he obtained because of his heirship and to
that extent he took in spite of the will and as in case of
intestacy. The fact that petitioner received less than

Syllabus.

the amount of his claim did not alter its nature or the
quality of its recognition through the distribution which
he did receive.
We are not convinced by the argument that petitioner
had but "the expectations" of an heir and realized on a
"bargaining position." He was heir in fact. Whether
he would receive any property in that capacity depended
upon the validity of his ancestor's will and the extent
to which it would dispose of his ancestor's estate. When,
by compromise and the decree enforcing it, that disposition was limited, what he got from the estate came to him
because he was heir, the compromise serving to remove
pro tanto the impediment to his inheritance. We are of
the opinion that the exemption applies.
In this view we find it unnecessary to consider the other
questions that have been discussed at the bar.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.
