OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

PER CURIAM.

This action was brought by George Leonidas, an employee of the Great Northern Railway Company, against
that Company and George Pappas, another of its employees, to recover damages for personal injuries alleged
to have been caused by defendants' negligence. The complaint set forth two causes of action but at the trial plaintiff elected to stand upon the second cause of action,
which was based upon the Federal Employers' Liability
Act. 45 U. S. C. 51-59. Defendants' motion for the
direction of a verdict in their favor was denied and the
jury found for the plaintiff. The Supreme Court of the
State affirmed the judgment. 105 Mont. 302; 72 P. 2d
1007.
After ruling that upon the evidence the question of
plaintiff's assumption of risk was one for the jury, the
court stated as a further ground for affirming the judgment that the defense of assumption of risk was not available under the federal statute. The court pointed to the
provision (§ 54) that an employee of the common carrier
shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment "in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee." The court ruled that the Federal Employers'
Liability Act was one intended to promote the safety of
employees and hence that the defense of assumption of
risk was barred.
This ruling was error. The provision of § 54 relates to
such statutes as the Safety Appliance Acts (March 2,
1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531; March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat.
943; April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298; February 17,
1911, c. 103, 36 Stat. 913); the Hours of Service Act
(March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415) ; and other statutes
subjecting carriers in interstate commerc6 to particular
obligations for the safety of their employees. Seaboard

Statement of the Case.

Southern Railway Co., 241 U. S. 229, 235, 236. Where
such violations are not involved, the defense of assumption of risk is available in actions under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton,
supra; Jacobs v. Southern Railway Co., supra; Atchison,
T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Swearingen, 239 U. S. 339, 344;
Baugham v. New York, P. & N. R. Co., 241 U. S. 237,
241; Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Ward, 252 U. S.
18, 21.
Despite this erroneous ruling, we are of the opinion that
the judgment should be affirmed upon the first ground
taken by the state court, that is, that the question of
assumption of risk was for the jury. It is not contended
that the instructions of the trial court upon that defense
were erroneous. The contention is that there was no evidence to go to the jury. We think that there was.
The judgment is affirmed with respect to the petitioner
Great Northern Railway Company. As to the petitioner
George Pappas, the writ of certiorari is dismissed upon
the ground that the federal question as to the right of
recovery under the Act against him individually, as distinguished from the Railway Company, was not properly
presented.
Affirmed in part; dismissed in part.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK is of

the opinion that the writ of

certiorari should be dismissed as to both petitioners.
