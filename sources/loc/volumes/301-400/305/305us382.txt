MINNESOTA v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 73.

Argued November 10, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.

1. The United States is an indispensable party defendant in a
condemnation proceeding brought by a State to acquire a right
of way over lands which the United States owns in fee and holds
in trust for Indian allottees. P. 386.
2. The exemption of the United States from being sued without its
consent extends to a suit by a State. Such a suit can not be maintained unless authorized by Act of Congress. P. 387.
3. The provision of § 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901 that, where
Indian allotted lands are condemned under state laws for a public
purpose, "the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the
allottee," does not require the conclusion that the United States
is not an indispensable party to the condemnation proceedings:
in view of the restraints on alienation imposed by other Acts of
Congress; the interest of the United States as trustee in the outcome of the proceeding (the amount to be paid); and the authority of the Secretary of the Interior in respect of reinvesting
the proceeds. P. 387.
4. Where jurisdiction has not been conferred by Congress, no officer
of the United States has power to give any court jurisdiction of a
suit against the United States. The facts that the United States
Attorney petitioned for removal of a suit from the state to the
federal court, and stipulated with counsel for plaintiff that the
suit could be so removed, are without legal significance in this
regard. P. 388.
5. A federal court is without jurisdiction of a suit removed to it
from a state court which itself lacked jurisdiction of the subject
matter or the parties; even though the federal court might have
had jurisdiction had the suit been brought there originally. P. 389.
6. The provision of the second paragraph of § 3 of the Act of March
3, 1901, authorizing "condemnation of" lands allotted in severalty
to Indians "in the same manner as land owned in fee," construed
as not authorizing suit in a state court. P. 389.
The contention that a long established administrative practice
makes for a contrary interpretation is unsupported.
95 F. 2d 468, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 580, to review a judgment which
reversed, with directions to dismiss, a judgment granting
the petition of the State for condemnation of a right of
way over Indian allotted lands. The suit was brought
originally in the state court but was removed to the
federal court.

Mr. Ordner T. Bundlie, Assistant Attorney General of
Minnesota, with whom Mr. William S. Ervin, Attorney
General, was on the brief, for petitioner. Mr. Bert McMullen entered an appearance for petitioner.
Mr. Mac Asbill, with whom Solicitor General Jackson,
Assistant Attorney General McFarland, and Mr. Oscar
Provost were on the brief, for the United States.
By leave of Court, Mr. John H. Hougen filed a brief, as
amicus curiae, on behalf of the Minnesota Chippewa
Tribe of Indians et al., in support of petitioner.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Minnesota brought in a court of the State this proceeding to take by condemnation pursuant to its laws a
right of way for a highway over nine allotted parcels of
land which form parts of the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, granted for the Band of Chippewa Indians of
Lake Superior by Treaty of September 30, 1854 (10 Stat.
1109) and the Act of Congress, January 14, 1889, c. 24,
25 Stat. 642. The parcels had been allotted in severalty
to individual Indians by trust patents. The highway was
located pursuant to requirements of the Constitution of
the State. It was not shown that authority had been obtained from the Secretary of the Interior for, the construction of the highway over the Indian lands. The
petition named as persons interested the owners under

the Indian allotments, the Superintendent of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency, and the United States, as
holder of the fee in trust.
The United States was named as a party defendant.
The United States Attorney, appearing specially for the
United States and generally for the other respondents,
filed a petition for the removal of the cause to the federal
court. He and counsel for the State stipulated that the
cause "may be [so] removed." The state court ordered
removal. In the federal court, the. United States, appearing specially, moved to dismiss the action on the
ground that it had not consented to be sued and that the
state court had no jurisdiction of the action or, over the
United States. The motion to dismiss was denied on the
ground that the United States is not a necessary party,
since "consent . . . to bring these proceedings against
the Indian allottees has been expressly granted and given
by the United States to the State of Minnesota, pursuant
to 25 United States Code Annotated, Section 357" (Act
of March 3, 1901, c. 832, § 3, 31 Stat. 1058, 1083-84),
the second paragraph of which provides:
"That lands allotted in severalty to Indians may be
condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the
State or Territory where located in the same manner as
land owned in fee may be condemned, and the money
awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee."
The petition for condemnation was granted.
Upon appeal by the United States, the Circuit Court
of Appeals held that the State was without power to condemn the Indian lands unless specifically authorized so
to do by the Secretary of the Interior, as provided in § 4
of the Act of 1901, which provides:
"That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to grant permission, upon compliance with such requirements as he may deem necessary, to the proper

Opinion of the Court.

State or local authorities for the opening and establishment of public highways, in accordance with the laws of
the State or Territory in which the lands are situated . .through any lands which have been allotted
in severalty to any individual Indians... but which have
not been conveyed to the allottees with full power of
alienation."
It held, further, that as such authorization had not been
shown, the United States had not consented to the
maintenance of the condemnation suit against it; that
the court was without jurisdiction to proceed; and that
the fact that removal from the state court to the federal
court had been obtained by the United States Attorney
by stipulation had not effected a general appearance. The
Circuit Court of Appeals, therefore, reversed the judgment of the District Court with directions to dismiss.
95 F. 2d 468. Certiorari was granted because of alleged
conflict with the established administrative practice under
the applicable statutes and the importance of the question presented.
The State contends that it had power, and its courts
jurisdiction, to condemn the allotted lands without making the United States a party to the proceedings: (1)
because authorized so to do by the second paragraph of
§ 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, quoted above; (2) because authorized so to do by the Treaty of September 30,
1854, 10 Stat. 1109, 1110, approved by Congress January
14, 1889, which provided in Article 3"All necessary roads, highways, and railroads, the lines of
which may run through any of the reserved tracts, shall
have the right of way through the same, compensation
being made therefor as in other cases."
(3) because the State, in its sovereign capacity and in
the exercise of its governmental functions in the location
and construction of a constitutional state truck highway

required to be so located and constructed by its constitution and laws, may, without express congressional authority therefor, exercise its inherent power of eminent
domain for such purpose over lands so allotted in severalty to individual Indians.
The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and the Grand Portage-Grand Marais Band thereof filed by the tribal attorney a brief praying that the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals be reversed and that of the District
Court affirmed.
First. The United States is an indispensable party defendant to the condemnation proceedings. A proceeding
against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States. The Siren, 7
Wall. 152, 154; Carr v. United States, 98 U. S. 433, 437;
Stanley v. Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255. Compare Utah
Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 389. It is
confessedly the owner of the fee of the Indian allotted
lands and holds the same in trust for the allottees. As
the United States owns the fee of these parcels, the right
of way cannot be condemned without making it a party.'
'The fee of the United States is not a dry legal title divorced
from substantial powers and responsibilities with relation to the
land. United States v. Rickert, 188 U. 'S. 432; compare Tiger v.
Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; Brader v. James, 246 U. S.
88. In the case of patents in fee with restraints on alienation it is
established that an alienation of the Indian's interest in the lands
by judicial decision in a suit to which the United States is not a
party has no binding effect but that the United States may sue to
cancel the judgment and set aside the conveyance made pursuant
thereto. Bowling & Miami Investment Co. v. United States, 233
U. S. 528; Privett v. United States, 256 U. S. 201; Sunderland v.
United States, 266 U. S. 226. In the stronger case of a trust allotment, it would seem clear that no effective relief can be given in
a proceeding to which the United States is not a party and that
the United States is therefore an indispensable party to any suit
to establish or acquire an interest in the lands. Compare McKay v.
Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458.

MINNESOTA v. UNITED STATES.
382

Opinion of the Court.

The exemption of the United States from being sued
without its consent extends to a suit by a State. Compare Kansas v. United States, 204 U. S.331, 342; Arizona
v. California, 298 U. S. 558, 568, 571, 572. Compare
Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S.373, 382-387; Oregon
v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 60. Hence Minnesota cannot
maintain this suit against the United States unless au-.
thorized by some act of Congress.
Minnesota contends that the United States is not an
indispensable party. It argues that since the second paragraph of § 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, provides that
"the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the
allottee," the United States has no interest in the land
or its proceeds after the condemnation is begun.' Under
§ 5 of the General Allotment Act, Act of February 8,
1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389, U. S. C. Title 25, § 348,
the Indians' interest in these allotted lands was subject
to restraints on alienation;' and by § 2 of the Indian Reorganization Act, Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576, 48 Stat.
984, U. S. C. Title 25, § 462, restraints on alienation were
extended. The clause quoted may not be interpreted as
freeing the allottee's land from the restraint imposed by
2The

extent of the restraints on alienation contained in § 5 of

the General Allotment Act was clarified and modified to some extent
by subsequent legislation. E. g., Act of May 27, 1902, c. 888,
§ 7, 32 Stat. 245, 275; Act of May 8, 1906, c. 2348, 34 Stat. 182;
Act of March 1, 1907,.c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1015, 1018; Act of May 29,
1908, c. 216, 35 Stat. 444; Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, §§ 1-5,
36 Stat. 855-56; Act of May 18, 1916, c. 125, 39 Stat. 123, 127; U. S.C.
Title 25, §§ 349, 372, 373, 378, 379, 394, 403, 404, 405, 408. Under § 4
of the Indian Reorganization Act, applicable to all Indian Reservations unless a majority of the adult Indians vote against its application, the transferability of restricted Indian lands is greatly limited.
Act of June 18, 1934, c. 576, 48 Stat. 984, U. S. C. Title 25, § 464.
'Compare the Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1018, U. S. C.
Title 25, § 405; Act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, §§ 4, 8, 36 Stat.
856-857; U. S. C. Title 25, §§ 403, 406.

other acts of Congress. As the parcels here in question
were restricted lands, the interest of the United States
continues throughout the condemnation proceedings. In
its capacity as trustee for the Indians it is necessarily interested in the outcome of the suit-in the amount to be
paid. That it is interested, also, in what shall be done
with the proceeds is illustrated by the Act of June 30,
1932, c. 333, 47 Stat. 474, U. S. C. Title 25, § 409a, under
which the Secretary of the Interior may determine that
the proceeds of the condemnation of restricted Indian
lands shall be reinvested in other lands subject to the
same restrictions."
Second. Minnesota contends that Congress has authorized suit against the United States. It is true that
authorization to condemn confers by implication permission to sue the United States. But Congress has pro-.
vided generally for suits against the United States in the
federal courts. And it rests with Congress to determine
not only whether the United States may be sued, but in
what courts the suit may be brought. This suit was begun in a state court. The fact that the removal was effected on petition of the United States and the stipulation of its attorney in relation thereto are facts without
legal significance. Where jurisdiction has not been con'Whenever any nontaxable land of a restricted Indian of the Five
Civilized Tribes or of any other Indian tribe is sold to any State,
county, or municipality for public-improvement purposes, or is acquired, under existing law, by any State, county, or municipality
by condemnation or other proceedings for such public purposes, or
is sold under existing law to any other person or corporation for
other purposes, the money received for said land may, in the
discretion and with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior,
be reinvested in other lands selected by said Indian, and such land
so selected and purchased shall be restricted as- to alienation, lease
or incumbrance, and nontaxable in the same quantity and upon the
same terms and conditions as the nontaxable lands from which the
reinvested funds were derived, and such restrictions shall appear in
the conveyance." See also note 7, infra.

MINNESOTA v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

ferred by Congress, no officer of the United States has
power to give to any court jurisdiction of a suit against
the United States. Compare Case v. Terrell, 11 Wall.
199, 202; Carr v. United States, 98 U. S. 433, 435-39;
Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227, 232-33; Stanley v.
Schwalby, 162 U. S. 255, 270; United States v. Garbutt
Oil Co., 302 U. S. 528, 533-35. If Congress did not grant
permission to bring this condemnation proceeding in a
state court, the federal court was without jurisdiction
upon its removal. For jurisdiction of the federal court
on removal is, in a limited sense, a derivative jurisdiction. Where the state court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties, the federal court acquires
none, although in a like suit originally brought in a federal court it would have had jurisdiction. Lambert Run
Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 258 U. S. 377, 383;
General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M. S. Ry. Co.,
260 U. S. 261, 288.
Third. Minnesota contends that Congress authorized
suit in a court of the state by providing in the second
paragraph of § 3 of the Act of March 3, 1901, quoted
above, for "condemnation of" lands allotted in severalty
to Indians "in the same manner as land owned in fee."
But the paragraph contains no permission to sue in
the court of a state. It merely authorizes condemnation for "any public purpose under the laws of the
State or Territory where located." There are persuasive
reasons why that statute should not be construed as authorizing suit in a state court. It relates to Indian lands
under trust allotments-a subject within the exclusive
control of the federal government. The judicial determination of controversies concerning such lands has been
commonly committed exclusively to federal courts.5
'Compare McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458; 28 Stat. 305; 31
Stat. 760; U. S. C. Title 25, § 345. The United States argues that
a statute granting permission to sue the United States must be construed to apply only to the federal courts unless there is an explicit

Minnesota asserted in support of its interpretation of
the paragraph that by long established administrative
practice such condemnation proceedings are brought in
the state court and without making the United States a
party.' The assertion was denied by the Government.
As the brief of neither counsel furnished adequate data
as to the administrative practice, they were requested at
the oral argument to furnish the data thereafter. From
the report then submitted by the Solicitor General it appears that throughout a long period the Secretary of the
Interior has insisted in Minnesota and in other States,
that condemnation suits must be brought in a federal
court and that the United States must be made a party
defendant.!
reference to the state tribunals, citing Stanley v. Schwalby, 162
U. S. 255, 270; United States v. Inaba, 291 F. 416, 418; United
States v. Deasy, 24 F. 2d 108, 110. This is not universally true
even as to suits against the United States itself. United States v.
Jones, 109 U. S. 513. And in many instances the state courts have
been held to have jurisdiction of suits against the instrumentalities
and officers of the United States which directly affect its property
interests without such specific statutory authorization. Missouri
Pacific R: Co. v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554; Sloan Shipyards v. United
States Shipping Board, 258 U. S. 549, 568-69; Olson v. United
States Spruce Production Corp., 267 U. S. 462; Federal Land Bank
v. Priddy, 295 U. S. 229, 235-37. Compare Davis v. L. N. Dantzler
Lumber Co., 261 U. S. 280.
In 35 Land Decisions 648 the Acting Secretary of the Interior
handed down on June 29, 1907, an opinion which recognized, without
any discussion, the validity of a condemnation proceeding brought
under the second paragraph of the Act of March 3, 1901, in a state
court, it not appearing that the United States was joined as a party.
'See also Regulation 691/2 of the Regulations of the Department
of the Interior, "Concerning Rights of Way over Indian Lands,"
adopted in the general revision of April 7, 1938, which provides:
"As the holder of the legal title to allotted Indian lands held in
trust, the United States must be made a party to all such condemnation suits and the action must be brought in the appropriate federal
district court, the procedure, however, to follow the provisions of
the State law on the subject, so far as applicable."

Statement of the Case.

CONTROL COMMISSION

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 130.

Argued December 7, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.

1. Since the Twenty-First Amendment, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not

limited by the commerce clause. P. 394.
2. Regulation discriminatory between domestic and imported intoxicating liquors, or between imported intoxicating liquors, is not prohibited by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 394.
3. A statute of Michigan prohibits dealers in beer in that State
from selling any beer manufactured in a State which by its laws
discriminates, in manner described, against beer manufactured in
Michigan. Pursuant to the statute, the state Liquor Control
Commission designated specifically other States, ten in number,
including Indiana, which discriminated against Michigan beer;

whereupon Michigan licensees were prohibited from purchasing, receiving, possessing, or selling any beer manufactured in those
States. Held, as applied to an Indiana manufacturer of beer, who
sought to restrain the enforcement of the Michigan statute, it was
not void as violating the commerce, due process, or equal protection clauses of the Federal Constitution. Pp. 392, 394.
It is unnecessary to consider whether the statute is retaliatory
or protective in character; it is valid in either aspect.
4. The power of the State to forbid the sale of intoxicating liquor
is undoubted. P. 394.
21 F. Supp. 969, affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree of a District Court of three judges,
denying a temporary injunction and dismissing the bill,
in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of a state liquor law,
alleged to be "retaliatory" and unconstitutional.
