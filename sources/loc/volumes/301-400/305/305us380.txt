OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

305 U. S.

J. BACON & SONS v. MARTIN.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 203.

Argued December 15, 1938.-Decided January 3, 1939.

The tax imposed by Kentucky on the "receipt" of cosmetics in the
State by any Kentucky retailer is not a direct burden on interstate commerce as applied to articles purchased in other States
and transported to the retailer at his place of business in Kentucky, siflce, as construed by the State's highest court, the imposition is not upon the act of receiving but upon subsequent sale
and use.

APPEAL from 273 Ky. 389; 116 S. W. 2d 963, dismissed
for want of a substantial federal question.

Mr. Charles I. Dawson for appellant.
Messrs. Hubert Meredith, Attorney General of Kentucky, and M. B. Holifield, Assistant Attorney General,
were on a brief for appellee.
PER CURIAM.

Plaintiff sought judgment declaring invalid a statute
imposing a tax on "the receipt of cosmetics in the State
by any Kentucky retailer," ' as applied to articles purchased from manufacturers and dealers in other States
and transported to plaintiff at its place of business in
Kentucky. Plaintiff contended that the tax was on "the
act of receiving" and hence was a direct burden upon
interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky
thus construed the statute:
"The word 'receipt' is not used in a limited sense, but in
the sense that it has already been received by the retailer
and is now in his use. . . . That word 'receipt' pre' Subsection (f) of § 2 of Chapter 3 of the 1936 Special Budget snd
Special Revenue Session of the Legislature of Kentucky. Carroll's
Kentucky Statutes, Baldwin's 1936 Revisicn, §§ 4281d-1 to 4281d-25.

Opinion of the Court.

supposes that the cosmetics were now in use and after the
sale had been consummated.
cc . .
It, therefore, follows that the imposition
of the tax against the retailer is not on the act
of receiving the cosmetics, but on the sale and use
thereof, after the retailer has received them, that
constitutes the excise tax. When we apply the intended and correct meaning of the word 'receipt' as used
in the act, it is conclusive to our minds that the tax of
the retailer, referred to, is paid when the articles are in
his possession and when the merchant has unlimited
control and dominion over the cosmetics." Martin v. J.
Bacon & Sons, 268 Ky. 612, 618, 619; 105 S. W. 2d 569,
572.
Adhering to that construction, the state court affirmed
the present judgment sustaining the tax. 273 Ky. 389;
116 S. W. 2d 963. The plaintiff appeals.
The construction of the statute by the state court is
binding upon us. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v.
Meyer, 265 U. S. 30, 32, 33; Hicklin v. Coney, 290 U. S.
169, 172; Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co. v. Nelson
ManufacturingCo., 291 U. S. 352, 358. And in the light
of its construction the state court applied the principles
declared in our decisions. Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, 292 U. S. 86, 93; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286
U. S. 472, 478, 479; Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 265, 266; Edelman v. Boeing Air
Transport,Inc.,, 289 U. S. 249, 252.
The appeal is dismissed for the want of a substantial
federal question.
Dismissed.
