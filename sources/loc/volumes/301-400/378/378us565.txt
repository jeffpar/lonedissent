HILL, AUDITOR OF CLARKE COUNTY, IOWA,
ET AL. v. DAVIS ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA.

No. 1079.

Decided June 22, 1964.

Judgment affirmed and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with views stated'in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533.

Reported below: 225 F. Supp. 689.

Ward Reynoldson for appellants.
Robert F. Wilson for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment below is affirmed. Reynolds v. Sims,
377 U. S. 533. The case is remanded for further proceedings, with respect to relief, consistent with the views
stated in our opinions in Reynolds v. Sims and in the
other cases relating to state legislative apportionment
decided along with Reynolds, should that become necessary. Since this appeal presents no question as to the
correctness of the District Court's later decision upholding the validity of the temporary reapportionment plan
enacted by the Iowa General Assembly in February 1964,
we do not consider or pass upon this matter.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK would affirm on the grounds stated
in his opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 587.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART would affirm the judgment
insofar as it holds that Iowa's system of legislative apportionment violates the Equal Protection Clause.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN

dissents for the reasons stated in

his dissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533,
589.
