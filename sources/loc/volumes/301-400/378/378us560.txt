378 U. S.

v. KERNER, GOVERNOR OF

ILLINOIS,

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN

No. 636.

DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

Decided June 22, 1964.

Judgment reversed and case remanded.
Reported below: 220 F. Supp. 230.

Bernard Kleiman, Lester Asher, John C. Melaniphy
and Charles S. Rhyne for appellants.
Howard J. Trienens and Gary L. Cowan for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment below is reversed. Reynolds v. Sims,
377 U. S. 533; Lucas v. Forty-FourthGeneral Assembly
of Colorado, 377 U. S. 713. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views stated in our
opinions in Reynolds v. Sims and in the other cases relating to state legislative apportionment decided along with
Reynolds.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART would
affirm the judgment, because, as the opinions of Judge
Campbell and Judge Schnackenberg demonstrate, 220 F.
Supp. 230, 235, the Illinois system of legislative apportionment is entirely rational and does not frustrate effective
majority rule.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissents for the reasons stated in
his dissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533,
589.

took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG
