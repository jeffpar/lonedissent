MARSHALL v. HARE.
378 U.S.

Per Curiam.

MARSHALL ET AL. v. HARE, SECRETARY OF
STATE OF MICHIGAN, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 962. Decided June 22, 1964.
Judgment reversed and case remanded.
Reported below: 227 F. Supp. 989.

Theodore Sachs for appellants.
Robert A. Derengoski, Solicitor General of Michigan,
Stanton S. Faville, Chief Assistant Attorney General, and
James R. Ramsey and Russell A. Searl, Assistant Attorneys General, for Hare et al.; and Edmund E. Shepherd
and R. William Rogers for Beadle et al., appellees.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment below is reversed. Reynolds v. Sims,
377 U. S. 533; Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly
of Colorado, 377 U. S. 713. The case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with the views stated in
our opinions in Reynolds v. Sims and in the other cases
relating to state legislative apportionment decided along
with Reynolds.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART would
affirm the judgment because the Michigan system of legislative apportionment is clearly a rational one and clearly
does not frustrate effective majority rule.

MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN

dissents for the reasons stated in

his dissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S.
533, 589.
