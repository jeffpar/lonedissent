392 U.S.

POPE v. UNITED STATES.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 34, Misc. Decided June 17, 1968.
Certiorari granted; 372 F. 2d 710, vacated and remanded.

Wallace M. Rudolph for petitioner.
Solicitor General Griswold, Assistant Attorney General
Vinson, Ralph S. Spritzer, Beatrice Rosenberg, and,
Jerome M. Feit for the United States.
PER CURIAM.

The petitioner was convicted by a jury and sentenced to
death under the Federal Bank Robbery Act, 18 U. S. C.
ยง 2113 (e). The Solicitor General has filed a memorandum for the United States conceding that this death
penalty provision "suffers from the same constitutional
infirmity" as that found in the Federal Kidnaping Act,
18 U. S. C. ยง 1201 (a). United States v. Jackson, 390
U. S. 570. Accordingly, the Solicitor General concedes
that the petitioner's "sentence must be vacated and the
cause remanded ... for resentencing." In light of this
concession and upon an independent examination of the
record, but without reaching any of the petitioner's other
claims, the mdtion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted, the
judgment is vacated, and Q e case is remanded to the
United States Court of Appvals for the Eighth Circuit
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion..
MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissent

for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of MR.
JUSTICE WHITE in United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S.
570, 591.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK dissents for the further reasons
stated in his dissenting opinion-in Lopinson v. Pennsylvania, ante, p. 648.
