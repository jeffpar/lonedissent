POWELL v. TEXAS.
APPEAL FROM THE COUNTY COURT AT LAW NO. 1 OF TRAVIS
COUNTY, TEXAS.

No. 405. Argued March 7, 1968.-Decided June 17, 1968.
Appellant was arrested and charged with being found in a state of
intoxication in a public place, in violation of Art. 477 of the
Texas Penal Code. He was tried in the Corporation Court of
Austin, and found guilty. He appealed to the County Court of
Travis County, and after a trial de novo, he was again found
guilty. That court made -the following "findings of fact":
(1) chronic alcoholism is a disease which destroys the afflicted
person's will power to resist the constant, excessive use of alcohol,
(2) a chronic alcoholic does not appear in public by his own
volition but under a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of
chronic alcoholism, and (3) appellant is a chronic alcoholic who
is afflicted by the disease of chronic alcoholism; but ruled as a
matter of law that chronic alcoholism was not a defense to the
charge. The principal testimony was that of a psychiatrist, who
testified that appellant, a man with a long history of arrests for
drunkenness, was a "chronic alcoholic" and was subject to a "compulsion" which was "not completely overpowering," but which
was "an exceedingly strong influence." Held: The judgment is
affirmed. Pp. 517-554.
Ma. JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by TIHE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR.
JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concluded that:

1. The lower court's "findings of fact" were not such in any
recognizable, traditional sense, but were merely premises of a
syllogism designed to bring this case within the scope of Robinson
v. California,370 U. S. 660 (1962). P. 521.
2. The record here is utterly inadequate to permit the informed
adjudication needed to support an important and wide-ranging
new constitutional principle. Pp. 521-522.
3. There is no agreement among medical experts as to what it
means to say that "alcoholism" is a "disease," or upon the "manifestations of alcoholism," or on the nature of a "compulsion."
Pp. 522-526.
4. Faced with the reality that there is no known generally'
effective method of treatment or adequate facilities or manpower

for a full-scale attack on the enormous problem of alcoholics, it
cannot be asserted that the use of the criminal process to deal
with the public aspects of problem drinking can never be defended
as rational. Pp. 526-530.
5. Appellant's conviction on the record in this case does not
violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth
Amendment. Pp. 531-537.
(a) Appellant was convicted, not for being a chronic alcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular occasion,
and thus, as distinguished from Robinson v. California, supra,
was not being punished for a mere status. P. 532.
(b) It cannot be concluded, on this record and the current
state of medical knowledge, that appellant suffers from such an
irresistible compulsion to drink and to get drunk in public that
he cannot control his performance of these acts and thus cannot
be deterred from public intoxication. In any event, this Court
has never articulated a general constitutional doctrine of mens rea,
as the development of the doctrine and its adjustment to changing
conditions has been thought to be the province of the States.
Pp. 535-536.
MR.JUSTICE BLACK, joined by Ma. JUSTICE HARLAN, concluded:
1. Public drunkenness, which has been a crime throughout our
history, is an offense in every State, and this Court certainly
cannot strike down a State's criminal law because of the heavy
burden of enforcing it. P. 538.
2. Criminal punishment provides some form of treatment, protects alcoholics from causing harm or being harmed by removing
them from the streets, and serves some deterrent functions; and
States should not be barred from using the criminal process in
attempting to cope with the problem. Pp. 538-540.
3. Medical decisions based on clinical problems of diagnosis
and treatment bear no necessary correspondence to the legal
decision whether the overall objectives of criminal law can be
furthered by imposing punishment; and States should not be
constitutionally required to inquire as to what part of a defendant's
personality is responsible for his actions and to excuse anyone
whose action was the result of a. "compulsion." Pp. 540-541.
4. Crimes which require the State to prove that the defendant
actually committed some proscribed act do not come within the
scope of Robinson v. California, supra, which is properly limited
to pure status crimes. Pp. 541-544.

5. Appellant's argument that it is cruel and unusual to punish
a person who is not morally blameworthy goes beyond the Eighth
Amendment's limits on the use of criminal sanctions and would
create confusion and uncertainty in areas of criminal law where
our understanding is not complete. Pp. 544-546.
6. Appellant's proposed constitutional rule is not only revolutionary but it departs from the premise that experience in making
local laws by local people is the safest guide for our Nation to
follow. Pp. 547-548..
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded:
While Robinson v. California, supra, would support the view
that a chronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge to consume alcohol
should not be punishable for drinking or being drunk, appellant's
conviction was for the different crime of being drunk in a public
place; and though appellant showed that he was to some degree
compelled to drink and that he was drunk at the time of his
arrest, he made no showing that he was unable to stay off the
streets at that time. Pp. 548-554.

join.
In late December 1966, appellant was arrested and
charged with being found in a state of intoxication in a
public place, in violation of Texas Penal Code, Art. 477
(1952), which reads as follows:
"Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state
of intoxication in any public place, or at any private
house except his own, shall be fined not exceeding
one hundred dollars."
Appellant was tried in the Corporation Court of Austin,
Texas, found guilty, and fined $20. He appealed to
the County Court at Law No. 1 of Travis County,
Texas, where a trial de novo was held. His counsel urged
that appellant was "afflicted with the disease of chronic
alcoholism," that "his, appearance in public [while drunk
was] . . . not of his own volition," and therefore that to
punish him criminally for that conduct would be cruel
and unusual, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.
The trial judge in the county court, sitting without a
jury, made certain findings of fact, infra, at 521, but ruled
as a matter of law that chronic alcoholism was not a
defense to the charge. He found appellant guilty, and
fined him $50. There being no further right to appeal
within the Texas judicial system,1 appellant appealed to
this Court; we noted probable jurisdiction. 389 U. S.

I.,

The principal testimony was that of Dr. David Wade,
a Fellow of the American Medical Association, duly certificated in psychiatry. His testimony consumed a total
of 17 pages in the trial transcript. Five of those pages
were taken up with a recitation of Dr. Wade's qualifica1Tex.

tions. In the next 12 pages Dr. Wade was examined by
appellant's counsel, cross-examined by the State, and reexamined by the defense, and those 12 pages contain
virtually all the material developed at trial which is
relevant to the constitutional issue we face here. Dr:
Wade sketched the outlines of the "disease" concept of
alcoholism; noted that there is no generally accepted
definition of "alcoholism"; alluded to the ongoing debate
within the medical profession over whether alcohol is
actually physically "addicting" or merely psychologically
"habituating"; and concluded that in either case a
"chronic alcoholic" is an "involuntary drinker," who is
"powerless not to drink," and who "loses his self-control
over his drinking." He testified that he had examined
appellant, and that appellant is a "chronic alcoholic,"
who "by the time he has reached [the state of intoxication] . . . is not able to control his behavior, and
[who] ... has reached this point because he has an uncontrollable compulsion to drink." Dr. Wade also responded
in the negative to the question whether appellant has
"the willpower to resist the constant excessive consumption of alcohol." He added that in his opinion jailing appellant without medical attention would operate neither
to rehabilitate him nor to lessen his desire for alcohol.
On cross-examination, Dr. Wade admitted that when
appellant was sober he knew the difference between right
and wrong, and he responded affirmatively to the question whether appellant's act of taking the first drink in
any given instance when he was sober was a "voluntary
exercise of 'his will." Qualifying his answer, Dr. Wade
stated that "these individuals have a compulsion, and
this compulsion, while not completely overpowering, is a
very strong influence, an exceedingly strong influence,
and this compulsion coupled with the firm belief in their
mind that they are going to be able to handle it from
now on causes their judgment to be somewhat clouded."

Opinion of

MARSHALL, J.

Appellant testified concerning the history of his drinking problem. He reviewed his many arrests for drunkenness; testified that he was unable to stop drinking; stated
that when he was intoxicated he had no control over his
actions and could not remember them later, but that he
did not become violent; and admitted that he did not
remember his arrest on the occa'sion for which he was
being tried. On cross-examination, appellant admitted
that he had had one drink on the morning of the trial and
had been able to discontinue drinking. In relevant part,
the cross-examination went as follows:
"Q. You took that one at eight o'clock because
you wanted to drink?
"A. Yes, sir.
"Q. And you knew that if you drank it, you could
keep on drinking and get drunk?
"A. Well, I was supposed to be here on trial, and
I didn't take but that one drink.
"Q. You knew you had to be here this afternoon,
but this morning you took one drink and then you
knew that you couldn't afford to drink any more
and come to court; is that right?
"A. Yes, sir, that's right.
"Q. So you exercised your will power .nd kept
from drinking anything today except that one drink?
"A. Yes, sir, that's right.
"Q. Because you knew what you would do if you
kept drinking, that you would finally pass out or be
picked up?
"A. Yes, sir.
"Q. And you didn't want that to happen to you
today?
"A. No, sir.
"Q. Not today?
"A. No, sir.

"Q. So you only had one drink today?
"A. Yes, sir."
On redirect examination, appellant's lawyer elicited the
following:
"Q. Leroy, isn't the real reason why you just had
one drink today because you just had enough money
to buy one drink?
"A. Well, that was just give to me.
"Q. In other words, you didn't have any money
with which you could buy any drinks yourself?
"A. No, sir, that was give to me.
"Q. And that's really what controlled the amount
you drank this morning, isn't it?
"A. Yes, sir.
"Q. Leroy, when you start drinking, do you have
any control over how many drinks you can take?
"A. No, sir."
Evidence in the case then closed. The State made no
effort to obtain expert psychiatric testimony of its own,
or even to explore with appellant's witness the question
of appellant's power to control the frequency, timing, and
location of his drinking bouts, or the substantial disagreement within the medical profession concerning the
nature of the disease, the efficacy of treatment and the
prerequisites for effective treatment. It did nothing to
exumine or illuminate what Dr. Wade might have meant
by his reference to a "compulsion" which was "not completely overpowering," but which was "an exceedingly
strong influence," or to inquire into the question of the
proper role of such a "compulsion" in constitutional
adjudication. Instead, the State contented itself with
a brief argument that appellant had no defense to the
charge because he "is legally sane and knows the difference between right and wrong."

POWELL v. TEXAS.

Opinion

of MARSHALL, J.

Following this abbreviated exposition of the problem
before it, the trial court indicated its intention to disallow appellant's claimed defense of "chronic alcoholism."
Thereupon defense coLinsel submitted, and the trial court
entered, the following "findings of fact":
i"(1) That chronic alcoholism is a disease which
destroys the afflicted person's will power to resist
the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol.
"(2) That a chronic alcoholic does not appear in
public by his own volition but under a compulsion
symptomatic of the disease of chronic alcoholism.
"(3) That Leroy Powell, defendant herein, is a
chronic alcoholic who is afflicted with the disease of
chronic alcoholism."
Whatever else may be said of them, those are not
"findings of fact" in any recognizable, traditional sense
in which that term has been used in a court of law;
they are the premises of a syllogism transparently designed to bring this case within the scope of this Court's
opinion in Robinson v. California,370 U. S. 660 (1962).
Nonetheless, the dissent would have us adopt these "findings" without critical examination; it would use them as
the basis for a constitutional holding that "a person may
not be punished if the condition essential to constitute
the defined crime is part of the pattern of his disease and
is occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic of the
disease." Post, at 569.
The difficulty with that position, as we shall show, is
that it goes much too far on the basis of too little knowledge. In the first place, the record in this case is utterly
inadequate to permit the sort of informed and responsible adjudication which alone can support the announcement of an important and wide-ranging new constitutional principle. We know very little about the
circumstances surrounding the drinking bout which re-

sulted in this conviction, or about Leroy Powell's drinking
problem, or indeed about alcoholism itself. The trial
hardly reflects the sharp legal and evidentiary clash between fully prepared adversary litigants which is traditionally expected in major constitutional cases. The
State put on only one witness, the arresting officer. The
defense put on three-a policeman who testified to appellant's long history of arrests for public drunkenness, the
psychiatrist, and appellant himself.
Furthermore, the inescapable fact is that there is no
agreement among members of the medical profession
about what it means to say that "alcoholism" is a "disease." One of the principal works in this field states
that the major difficulty in articulating a "disease concept
of alcoholism" is that "alcoholism has too many definitions and disease has practically none." 2 This same
author concludes that "a disease is what the medical profession recognizes as such. '' 3 In other words, there is
widespread agreement today that "alcoholism" is a "disease," for the simple reason that the medical profession
has concluded that it should attempt to treat those who
have drinking problems. There the agreement stops.
Debate rages within the medical profession as to whether
"alcoholism" is a separate "disease" in any meaningful
biochemical, physiological or psychological sense, or
whether it represents one peculiar manifestation in some
individuals of underlying psychiatric disorders.'
'Nor is there any substantial consensus as to the "manifestations of alcoholism." E. M. Jellinek, one of the
outstanding authorities on the subject, identifies five

different types of alcoholics which predominate in the
United States, and these types display a broad range
of different and occasionally inconsistent symptoms.5
Moreover, wholly distinct types, relatively rare in this
country, predominate in nations with different cultural
attitudes regarding the consumption of alcohol. Even
if we limit our consideration to the range of alcoholic
symptoms more typically found in this country, there
is substantial disagreement as to the manifestations of
the "disease" called "alcoholism." Jellinek, for example,
considers that only two of his five alcoholic types can
truly be said to be suffering from "alcoholism" as a
"disease," because only these two types attain what
he believes to be the requisite degree of physiological
dependence on alcohol." He applies the label "gamma
alcoholism" to "that species of alcoholism in which
(1) acquired increased tissue tolerance to alcohol, (2)
adaptive cell metabolism.... (3) withdrawal symptoms
and 'craving,' i. e., physical dependence, and (4) loss
of control are involved." '
A "delta" alcoholic, on the
other hand, "shows the first three characteristics of
gamma alcoholism as well as a less marked form of the
fourth characteristic-that is, instead of loss of control
5Jeffinek, eupra, n. 2, at 35-41.
6 For example, in nations where large quantities of wine are
customarily consumed with meals, apparently there are many people
who are completely unaware that they have a "drinking problem"they rarely if ever show signs of intoxication, they display no
marked symptoms of behavioral disorder, and are entirely capable
of limiting their alcoholic intake to a reasonable amount-and yet
who display severe withdrawal symptoms, sometimes including delirium tremens, when deprived of their daily portion of wine. M.

there is inability to abstain." ' Other authorities approach the problems of classification in an entirely different manner and, taking account of the large role which
psycho-social factors seem to play in "problem drinking,"
define the "disease" in terms of the earliest identifiable
manifestations of any sort of abnormality in drinking
patterns. 10
Dr. Wade appears to have testified about appellant's
"chronic alcoholism" in terms similar to Jellinek's
"gamma" and "delta" types, for these types are largely
defined, in their later stages, in terms of a strong compulsion to drink, physiological dependence and an inability to abstain from drinking. No attempt was made
in the court below, of course, to determine whether Leroy
Powell could in fact properly be diagnosed as a "gamma"
or "delta" alcoholic in Jellinek's terms. The focus at
the trial, and in the dissent here, has been exclusively
upon the factors of loss of control and inability to abstain.
Assuming that it makes sense to compartmentalize in
this manner the diagnosis of such a formless "disease,"
tremendous gaps in our knowledge remain, which the
record in this case does nothing to fill.
The trial court's "finding" that Powell "is afflicted with
the disease of chronic alcoholism," which "destroys the
afflicted person's will power to resist the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol" covers a multitude of sins.
Dr. Wade'8 testimony that appellant suffered from a compulsion which was an "exceedingly strong influence," but
which was "not completely overpowering" is at least more
carefully stated, if no less mystifying. Jellinek insists
that conceptual clarity can only be achieved by distinguishing carefully between "loss of control" once an individual has commenced to drink and "inability to abstain"

from drinking in the first place. 1 Presumably a person
would have to display -both characteristics in order to
make out a constitutional defense, should one be recognized. Yet the "findings" of -thetrial court utterly fail to
make this crucial distinction, and there is serious question
whether the record can be read to support a finding of
either loss of control or inability to abstain.
Dr. Wade did testify that once appellant began drinking he appeared to have no control over the amount of
alcohol he finally ingested. Appellant's own testimony
concerning his drinking on the day of the trial would
certainly appear, however, to cast doubt upon the conclusion that he was without control over his consumption
of alcohol when he had sufficiently important reasons to
exercise such control. However that may be, there are
more serious factual and conceptual difficulties with
reading this record to show that appellant was unable to
abstain from drinking. Dr. Wade testified that when
appellant was. sober, the act of taking the first drink was
a "voluntary exercise of his will," but that this exercise
of will was undertaken under the "exceedingly strong
influence" of a "compulsion" which was "not completely
overpowering." Such concepts, when juxtaposed in this
fashion, have little meaning.
Moreover, Jellinek asserts that it cannot accurately
be said that a person is truly unable to abstain from
drinking unless he is suffering the physical symptoms of
withdrawal. 2 There is no testimony in this record that
Leroy Powell underwent withdrawal symptoms either
before he began the drinking spree which resulted in the
conviction under review here, or at any other time. In
attempting to deal with the alcoholic's desire for drink
in the absence of withdrawal symptoms, Jellinek is re11 Jellinek, supra, n. 2, at 41-42.
12 Id., at 43,

duced to unintelligible distinctions between a "compulsion" (a "psychopathological phenomenon" which can
apparently serve in. some instances as the functional
equivalent of a "craving" or symptom of withdrawal)
and an "impulse" (something which differs from a loss
of control, a craving or a compulsion, and to which
Jellinek attributes the start of a new drinking bout for
a "gamma" alcoholic). 13 Other scholars are equally
unhelpful in articulating the nature of a "compulsion." "
It is one thing to say that if a man is deprived of
alcohol his hands will begin to shake, he will suffer agonizing pains and ultimately he will have hallucinations;
it is quite another to say that a man has a "compulsion"
to take a drink, but that he also retains a certain amount
of "free will" with which to resist. It is simply impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to ascribe
a useful meaning to the latter statement. This definitional confusion reflects, of course, not merely the undeveloped state of the psychiatric art but also the conceptual difficulties inevitably attendant upon the importation of scientific and medical models- into a legal
system generally predicated upon a different set of
assumptions.15

knowledge on the subject, it cannot be denied that the

cipal social and public health problems.0 The lowest
current informed estimate places the number of "alcoholics" in America (definitional problems aside) at
4,000,000,17 and most authorities are inclined to put the
figure considerably higher.'8 The problem is compounded
by the fact that a very large percentage of the alcoholics
in this country are "invisible"-they possess the means
to keep their drinking problems secret, and the traditionally uncharitable attitude of our society toward alcoholics causes many of them to refrain from seeking treatment from any source."0 Nor can it be gainsaid that
the legislative response to this enormous problem has in
general been inadequate.
There is as yet no known generally effective method
for treating the vast number of alcoholics in our society.
Some individual alcoholics have responded to particular
forms of therapy with remissions of their symptomatic
dependence upon the drug. But just as there is no
agreement among doctors and social workers with respect.
to the causes of alcoholism, there is no consensus as to
why particular treatments have been effective in particular cases and there is no generally agreed-upon approach
to the problem of treatment on a large scale.'0 Most
psychiatrists are apparently of the opinion that alcoholism is far more difficult to treat than other forms of
behavioral disorders, and some believe it is impossible

to cure by means of psychotherapy; indeed, the medical
profession as a whole, and psychiatrists in particular,
have been severely criticised for the prevailing reluctance
to undertake the treatment of drinking problems. 2'
Thus it is entirely possible that, even were the manpower
and facilities available for a full-scale attack upon chronic
alcoholism, we would find ourselves unable to help the
vast bulk of our "visible"-let alone our "invisible"alcoholic population.
However, facilities for the attempted treatment of indigent alcoholics are woefully lacking throughout the
country.22 It would be tragic to return large numbers
of helpless, sometimes dangerous and frequently unsanitary inebriates to the streets of our cities without even
the opportunity to sober up adequately which a brief jail
term provides. Presumably no State or city will tolerate

Encouraging pilot projects do exist. See President's Commission
on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force
Report: Drunkenness 50-64, 82-108 (1967). But the President's
Commission concluded that the "strongest barrier" to the abandonment of the current use of the criminal process to deal with public
intoxication "is that there presently are no clear alternatives for
taking into custody and treating those who are now arrested as
drunks." President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 235
(1967). Moreover, even if massive expenditures for physical plants
were forthcoming, there is a woeful shortage of trained personnel
to man them. One study has concluded that:
"[T]here is little likelihood that the number of workers in these fields
could be sufficiently increased to treat even a large minority of
problem drinkers. In California, for instance, according to the best
estimate available, providing all problem drinkers with weekly
contact with a psychiatrist and once-a-month contact with a social
worker would require the full time work of every psychiatrist and
every trained social worker in the United States." Cooperative

such a state of affairs. Yet the medical profession cannot, and does not, tell us with any assurance that, even
if the buildings, equipment and trained personnel were
made available, it could provide anything more than
slightly higher-class jails for our indigent habitual inebriates. Thus we run the grave risk that nothing will
be accomplished beyond the hanging of a new signreading "hospital"-over one wing of the jailhouse. 3
One virtue of the criminal process is, at least, that the
duration of penal incarceration typically has some outside
statutory limit; this is universally true in the case of
petty offenses, such as public drunkenness, where jail
terms are quite short on the whole. "Therapeutic civil
commitment" lacks this feature; one is typically committed until one is "cured." Thus, to do otherwise than
affirm might subject indigent alcoholics to the risk that
they may be locked up for an indefinite period of time
under the same conditions as before, with no more hope
than before of receiving effective treatment and no
prospect of periodic "freedom." 24

Faced with this unpleasant reality, we are unable to
assert that the use of the criminal process as a means
of dealing with the public aspects of problem drinking
can never be defended as rational. The picture of the
penniless drunk propelled aimlessly and endlessly through
the law's "revolving door" of arrest, incarceration, release
and re-arrest is not a pretty one. But before we condemn the present practice across-the-board, perhaps we
ought to be able to point to some clear promise of a
better world for these unfortunate people. Unfortunately, no such promise has yet been forthcoming. If, in
addition to the absence of a coherent approach to the
problem of treatment, we consider the almost complete
absence of facilities and manpower for the implementation of a rehabilitation program, it is difficult to say in
the present context that the criminal process is utterly
lacking in social value. This Court has never held that
anything in the Constitution requires that penal sanctions be designed solely to achieve therapeutic or rehabilitative effects, and it can hardly be said with assurance that incarceration serves such purposes any better
for the general run of criminals than it does for public
drunks.
Ignorance likewise impedes our assessment of the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions for public drunkenness. The fact that a high percentage of American
alcoholics conceal their drinking problems, not merely
by avoiding public displays of intoxication but also by
shunning all forms of treatment, is indicative that some
powerful deterrent operates to inhibit the public revelaremind them that just as difficult legal problems exist there as with

tion of the existence of alcoholism. Quite probably this
deterrent effect can be largely attributed to the harsh
moral attitude which our society has traditionally taken
toward intoxication and the shame which we have associated with alcoholism. Criminal conviction represents
the degrading public revelation of what Anglo-American
society has long condemned as a moral defect, and the
existence of criminal sanctions may serve to reinforce
this cultural taboo, just as we presume it serves to
reinforce other, stronger feelings against murder, rape,
theft, and other forms of antisocial conduct.
Obviously, chronic alcoholics have not been deterred
from drinking to excess by the existence of criminal sanctions against public drunkenness. But all those who
violate penal laws of any kind are by definition undeterred. The lon-standing and still raging debate over
the validity of the deterrence justification for penal sanctions has not reached any sufficiently clear conclusions
to permit it to be said that such sanctions are ineffective
in any particular context or for any particular group
of people who are able to appreciate the consequences
of their acts. Certainly no effort was made at the trial
of this case, beyond a monosyllabic answer to a perfunctory one-line question, to determine the effectiveness
of penal sanctions in deterring Leroy Powell in particular
or chronic alcoholics in general from drinking at all or
from getting drunk in particular places or at particular
times.
III.
Appellant claims that his conviction on the facts of
this case would violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment as applied to the
States through the Fourteenth Amendment. The primary purpose of that clause has always been considered,
and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of

punishment imposed for the violation of criminal statutes, the nature of the conduct made criminal is ordinarily relevant only to the fitness of the punishment
imposed. See, e. g., Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958);
Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459
(1947); Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349 (1910).25
Appellant, however, seeks to come within the application of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause
announced in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660
(1962); which involved a state statute making it a crime
to "be addicted to the use of narcotics." This Court
held there that "a state law which imprisons a person
thus afflicted [with narcotic addiction] as a criminal,
even though he has never touched any narcotic drug
within the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior
there, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment .... .
Id., at 667.
On its face the present case does not fall within that
holding, since appellant was convicted, not for being a
chronic alcoholic, but for being in public while drunk
on a particular occasion. The State of Texas thus has
not sought to punish a mere status, as California did in
Robinson; nor has it attempted to regulate appellant's
behavior in the privacy of his own home. Rather, it
has imposed upon appellant a criminal sanction for public
behavior which may create substantial health and safety
hazards, both for appellant and for members of the
general public, and which offends the moral and esthetic
sensibilities of a large segment of the community. This
seems a far cry from convicting one for being an addict,
being a chronic alcoholic, being "mentally ill, or a
leper . . . ." Id., at 666.

POWELL v. TEXAS.
Opinion of

Robinson so viewed brings this Court but a very small
way into the substantive criminal law. And unless Robinson is so viewed it is difficult to see any limiting
principle that would serve to prevent this Court from
becoming, under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual
Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards
of criminal responsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal
law, throughout the country.
R is suggested in dissent that Robinson stands for the
"simple" but "subtle" principle that "[c]riminal penalties
may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition
he is powerless to change." Post, at 567. In that view,
appellant's "condition" of public intoxication was "occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic of the disease" of
chronic alcoholism, and thus, apparently, his behavior
lacked the critical element of mens rea. Whatever may
be the merits of such a doctrine of criminal responsibility,
it surely cannot be said to follow from Robinson. The
entire thrust of Robinson's interpretation of the Cruel
and Unusual Punishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be inflicted only if the accused has committed
some act, has engaged in some behavior, which society has
an interest in preventing, or perhaps in historical common
law terms, has committed some actus reus. It thus does
not deal with the question of whether certain conduct
cannot constitutionally be punished because it is, in some
sense, "involuntary" or "occasioned by a compulsion."
_ , Likewise, as the dissent acknowledges, there is a substantial definitional distinction between a "status," as
in Robinson, and a "condition," which is said to. b6
involved in this case. Whatever may be the merits of
an attempt to distinguish between behavior and a condition, it is perfectly clear that the crucial element in
this case, so far as the dissent is concerned, is whether
or not appellant can legally be held responsible for his

appearance in public in a state of intoxication. The only
relevance of Robinson to this issue is that because the
Court interpreted the statute thepe involved as making
a "status" criminal, it was able to suggest that the statute
would cover even a situation in which addiction had
been acquired involuntarily. 370 U. S., at 667, n. 9.
That this factor was not determinative in the case is
shown by the fact that there was no indication of how
Robinson himself had become an addict.
Ultimately, then, the most troubling aspects of this
case, were Robinson to be extended to meet it, would be
the scope and content of what could only be a constitutional doctrine of criminal responsibility. In dissent it
is urged that the decision could be limited to conduct
which is "a characteristic and involuntary part of the
pattern of the disease as it afflicts" the particular individual, and that "[i] t is not foreseeable" that it would be
applied "in the case of offenses such as driving a car
while intoxicated, assault, theft, or robbery." Post, at
559, n. 2. That is limitation by fiat. In the first place,
nothing in the logic of the dissent would limit its application to chronic alcoholics. If Leroy Powell cannot
be convicted of public intoxication, it is difficult to see
how a State can convict an individual for murder, if that
individual, while exhibiting normal behavior in all other
respects, suffers from a "compulsion" to kill, which is
an "exceedingly strong influence," but "not completely
overpowering." " Even if we limit our consideration to
chronic alcoholics, it would seem impossible to confine
the principle within the arbitrary bounds which the dissent seems to envision.
It is not difficult to imagine a case involving psychiatric testimony to the effect that an individual suffers

from some aggressive neurosis which he is able to control
when sober; that very little alcohol suffices to remove
the inhibitions which normally contain these aggressions,
with the result that the individual engages in assaultive
behavior without becoming actually intoxicated; and
that the individual suffers from a very strong desire to
drink, which is an "exceedingly strong influence" but
''not completely overpowering." Without being untrue
to the rationale of this case, should the principles advanced in dissent be accepted here, the Court could not
avoid holding such an individual constitutionally unaccountable for his assaultive behavior.
Traditional common-law concepts of personal accountability and essential considerations of federalism lead
us to disagree with appellant. We are unable to conclude, on the state of this record or on the current state
of medical knowledge, that chronic alcoholics in general,
and Leroy Powell in particular, suffer from such an irresistible compulsion to drink and to get drunk in public
that they are utterly unable to control their performance
of either or both of these acts and thus cannot be deterred
at all from public intoxication. And in any event this
Court has never articulated a general constitutional doctrine of mens rea.27
We cannot cast aside the centuries-long evolution of
the collection of. interlocking and overlapping concepts
which the common law has utilized to assess the moral
27 The Court did hold in Lambert v. California, 355 U. S. 225
(1957), that a person could not be punished for a "crime" of omission,
if that person did not know, and the State had taken no reasonable
steps to inform him, of his duty to act and of the criminal penalty

for failure to do so. It is not suggested either that Lambert established a constitutional doctrine of mens rea, see generally Packer,
Mens Rea and the Supreme Court, 1962 Sup. Ct. Rev. 107, or that
appellant in this case was not fully aware of the prohibited nature
of his conduct and of the consequbnces of taking his first drink.

accountability of an individual for his antisocial deeds."8
The doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake,
justification, and duress have historically provided the
tools for a constantly shifting adjustment of the tension
between the evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, and medical views of
the nature of man. This process of adjustment has
always been thought to be the province of the States.
Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court to
be impelled into defining some sort of insanity test in
constitutional terms. Yet, that task would seem to follow inexorably from an extension of Robinson to this case.
If a person in the "condition" of being a chronic alcoholic
cannot be criminally punished as a constitutional matter
for being drunk in public, it would seem to follow that
a person who contends that, in terms of one test, "his
unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental
defect," Durham v. United States, 94 U. S. App. D. C.
228, 241, 214 F. 2d 862, 875 (1954), would state an issue
of constitutional dimension with regard to his criminal
responsibility had he been tried under some different and
perhaps lesser standard, e. g., the right-wrong test of
M'Naghten's Case."9 The experimentation of one jurisdiction in that field alone indicates the magnitude of the
problem. See, e. g., Carter v. United States, 102 U. S.
App. D. C. 227, 252 F. 2d 608 (1957); Blocker v. United
States, 107 U. S. App. D. C. 63, 274 F. 2d 572 (1959);

While I agree that the grounds set forth in MR. JUSTICE
MARSHALL'S opinion are sufficient to require affirmance
of the judgment here, I wish to amplify my reasons for
concurring.
Those who favor the .,change now urged upon us rely.,
on their own notions oi, the wisdom of this Texas law to
erect a constitutional barrier, the desirability of which
is far from clear. To adopt this position would Significantly limit the States in their efforts to deal with
a widespread and important social problem and would
do so by announcing Wrevolutionary doctrine of constitutional law that would also tightly restrict state power to
deal'with a wide variety of other harmful conduct.
I.
Those who favor holding that public drunkenness
cannot be made, a crime rely to a large extent on their
own notions of the wisdom of such a change in the law.
A great deal of medical and sociological data is cited to
us in support of this change. Stress is put upon the fact
that medical authorities consider alcoholism a disease and
have urged a variety of medical approaches to treating if.
It -is pointed out that aThigh percentage of all arrests in
America are for the crime of public drunkenness and
that the enforcement of these laws constitutes a tremendous burden orr the police. Then it is argued that

OCTOBER TERM, 1967.

392 U. S.

there is no basis whatever for claiming that to jail chronic
alcoholics can be a deterrent or a means of treatment;
on the contrary, jail has, in the expert judgment of these
scientists, a destructive effect- All in all, these arguments
read more like a highly technical medical critique than
an argument for deciding a question of constitutional
law one way or another.
Of course, the desirability of this Texas statute should
be irrelevant in a court charged with the.,uty of interpretation rather than legislation, and that should be the
end of the matter. But since proponents of this grave
constitutional change insist on offering their pronouncements on these questions of medical diagnosis and social
policy, I am compelled to add that, should we follow
their arguments, the Court would be venturing far
beyond the realm of problems for which we are in a position to know what we are talking about.
Public drunkenness has been a crime throughout our
history, and even before our history it was explicitly
proscribed by a 1606 English statute, 4 Jac. 1, c. 5. It
is today made an offense in every State in the Union.
The number of police to be assigned to enforcing-these
laws and the amount of time they should spend in the
effort would seem to me a question for each local community. Never, even by the wildest stretch of this
Court's judicial review power, could it be thought that
a State's criminal law could be struck down because
the amount of time spent in enforcing it constituted, in
some expert's opinion, a tremendous burden.
Jailing of chronic alcoholics is definitely defended as
therapeutic, and the claims of therapeutic value are not
insubstantial.

As appellee notes, the alcoholics are re-

moved from the streets, where in their intoxicated state
.they may be in physical danger, and are given food,
clothing, and shelter until they "sober up" and thus at
least regain their ability to keep from being run over by

POWELL v. TEXAS.

automobiles in the street. Of course, this treatment may
not be "therapeutic" in the sense of curing the underlying causes of their behavior, but it seems probable that
the effect of jail on any criminal is seldom "therapeutic"
in this sense, and in any case the medical authorities
relied on so heavily by appellant themselves stress that
no generally effective method of curing alcoholics has yet
been discovered.
Apart from the value of jail as a form of treatment,
jail serves other traditional functions of the criminal law.
For one thing, it gets the alcoholics off the street, where
they may cause harm in a number of ways to a number
of people, and isolation of the dangerous has always
been considered an important function of the criminal
law. In addition, punishment of chronic alcoholics can
serve several deterrent functions-it can give potential
alcoholics an additional incentive to control their drinking, and it may, even in the case of the chronic alcoholic,
strengthen his incentive to control the frequency and
location of his drinking experiences.
These values served by criminal punishment assume
even greater significance in light of the available alternatives for dealing with the problem of alcoholism. Civil
commitment facilities may not be any better than the
jails they would replace. In addition, compulsory commitment can hardly be considered a less severe penalty
from the alcoholic's point of view. The commitment
period will presumably be at least as long, and it might
ini fact be longer since commitment often lasts until the
"sick" person is cured. And compulsory commitment
would of course carry with it a social stigma little different in practice from that associated with drunkenness
when it is labeled a "crime."
Even the medical authorities stress the need for continued experimentation with a variety of approaches. I
cannot say that the States should be totally barred from

one avenue of experimentation, the criminal process, in
attempting to find a means to cope with this difficult social problem. From what I have been able to learn about
the subject, it seems to me that the present use of criminal sanctions might possibly be unwise, but I am by no
means convinced that any use of criminal sanctions would
inevitably be unwise or, above all, that I am qualified
in this area to know what is legislatively wise and what
is legislatively unwise.
II.

I agree with MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL that the findings
of fact in this case are inadequate to justify the sweeping
constitutional rule urged upon us. I could not, however, consider any findings that could be made with respect to "voluntariness" or "compulsion" controlling on
the question whether a specific instance of human
behavior should be immune from punishment as a constitutional matter. When we say that appellant's appearance in public is caused not by "his own" volition
but rather by some other force, we are clearly thinking
of a force that is nevertheless "his" except in some special
sense.' The accused undoubtedly commits the proscribed
act and the only question is whether the act can be
attributed to a part of "his" personality that should not
be regarded as criminally responsible. Almost all of the
traditional purposes of the criminal law can be significantly served by punishing the person who in fact committed the proscribed act, without regard to whether his
action was "compelled" by some elusive "irresponsible"
aspect of his personality. As I have already indicated,
punishment of such a defendant can clearly be justified
'If an intoxicated person is actually carried into the street by
someone else, "he" does not do the act at all, and of course he is
entitled to acquittal. E. g., Martin v. State, 31 Ala. App. 334, 17
So. 2d 427 (1944).

in terms of deterrence, isolation, and treatment. On the
other hand, medical decisions concerning the use of a
term such as "disease" or "volition," based as they are
on the clinical problems of diagnosis and treatment, bear
no necessary correspondence to the legal decision whether
the overall objectives of the criminal law can be furthered by imposing punishment. For these reasons,
much as I think that criminal sanctions should in many
situations be applied only to those whose conduct is
morally blameworthy, see Morissette v. United State§,
342 U. S. 246 (1952), I cannot think the States should

be held constitutionally required to make the inquiry
as to what part of a defendant's personality is responsible
for his actions and to excuse anyone whose action was,
in some complex, psychological sense, the result of a
"compulsion." 2

not required by Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660

Bazelon states:
"[I]t may be that psychiatry and the other social and behavioral
sciences cannot provide sufficient data relevant to a determination
of criminal responsibility no matter what our rules of evidence are.
If so, we may be forced- to eliminate the insanity defense altogether,
or refashion it in a way which is not tied so tightly to the medical
model. . . . But at least we will be able to make that decision

addict. We explicitly- limited our holding to the situation where no conduct of any kind is involved, stating:
"We hold that a state law which imprisons a person
thus afflicted as a criminal, even though he has never
touched any narcotic drug within the State or been
guilty of any irregularbehavior there, inflicts a cruel
and unusual punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment." 370 U. S., at 667. (Emphasis
added.)
The argument is made that appellant comes within the
terms of our holding in Robinson because being drunk
in public is a mere status or "condition." Despite this
many-faceted use of the concept of "condition," this
argument would require converting Robinson into a case
protecting actual behavior, a step we explicitly refused
to take in that decision.
A different question, I admit, is whether our attempt
in Robinson to limit our holding to pure status crimes,
involving no conduct whatever, was a sound one. I
believe it was. Although some of our objections to the
statute in Robinson are equally applicable to statutes
that punish conduct "symptomatic" of a disease, any
attempt to explain Robinson as based solely on the lack
of voluntariness encounters a number of logical difficulties.3 Other problems raised by status crimes are in
no way involved when the State attempts to punish for
conduct, and these other problems were, in my view, the
controlling aspects of our decision.
3 Although we noted in Robinson, 370 U. S., at 667, that narcotics
addiction apparently is an illness that can be contracted innocently
or involuntarily, we barred punishment for addiction even when it

could be proved that the defendant had voluntarily become addicted.
And we compared addiction to the status of having a common cold,
a condition that most people can either avoid or quickly cure when
it is important enough for them to do so.

POWELL v. TEXAS.
514

Opinion of

BLACK,

J.

Punishment for a status is particularly obnoxious, and
in many instances can reasonably be called cruel and
unusual, because it involves punishment for a mere propensity, a desire to commit an offense; the mental element is not simply one part of the crime but may-constitute all of it. This is a situation universally sought
to be avoided in our criminal law; the fundamental
requirement that some action be proved is solidly established even for offenses most heavily based on propensity,
such as attempt, conspiracy, and recidivist crimes.' In
fact, one eminent authority has found only one isolated
instance, in all of Anglo-American jurisprudence, in which
criminal responsibility was imposed in the absence of any
act at all.5
The reasons for this refusal to permit conviction without proof of an act are difficult to spell out, but they are
nonetheless perceived and universally expressed in our
criminal law. Evidence of propensity can be considered
relatively unreliable and more difficult for a defendant
to rebut; the requirement of a specific act thus provides
some protection against false charges. See 4 Blackstone,
Commentaries 21. Perhaps more fundamental is the
difficulty of distinguishing, in the absence of any conduct, between desires of the day-dream variety and fixed
intentions that may pose a real threat to society; extending the criminal law to cover both types of desire would
be unthinkable, since "[t]here can hardly be anyone
who has never thought evil. When a desire is inhib4As

Glanville Williams puts it, "[Ithat crime requires an act is
invariably true if the proposition be read as meaning that a private
thought is not sufficient to found responsibility." Williams, Criminal
Law-the General Part 1 (1961). (Emphasis added.) For the
requirement of some act as an element of conspiracy and attempt,
see id., at 631, 663, 668; R. Perkins, Criminal Law 482, 531-532
(1957).

ited it may find expression in fantasy; but it would be
absurd to condemn this natural psychological mechanism
as illegal." 6
In contrast, crimes that require the State to prove
that the defendant actually committed some proscribed
act involve none of these special problems. In addition, the question whether an act is "involuntary" is,
as I have already indicated, an inherently elusive question, and one which the State may, for good reasons, wish
to regard as irrelevant. In light of all these considerations, our limitation of our Robinson holding to pure
status crimes seems to me entirely proper.
IV.
The rule of constitutional law urged upon us by appellant would have a revolutionary impact on the criminal
law, and any possible limits proposed for the rule would
be wholly illusory. If the original boundaries of Rob- inson are to be discarded, any new limits too would soon
fall by the wayside and the Court would be forced to
hold the States powerless to punish any conduct that
could be shown to result from a "compulsion," in the
complex, psychological meaning of that term. The
result, to choose just one illustration, would be to require
recognition of "irresistible impulse" as a complete defense
to any crime; this is probably contrary to present law
in most American jurisdictions.7
The real reach of any such decision, however, would be
broader still, for the basic premise underlying the argument is that it is cruel and unusual to punish a person
who is not morally blameworthy. I state the proposition
in this sympathetic way because I feel there is much to
be said for avoiding the use of criminal sanctions in man-y
6Id.,

such situations. See Morissette v. United States, supra.
But the question here is one of constitutional law. The
legislatures have always been allowed wide freedom to
determine the extent to which moral culpability should
be a prerequisite to conviction of a crime. E. g., United
States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277 (1943). The criminal law is a social tool that is employed in seeking a wide
variety of goals, and I cannot say the Eighth Amendment's limits on the use of criminal sanctions extend as
far as this viewpoint would inevitably carry them.
But even if we were to limit any holding in this field
to "compulsions" that are "symptomatic" of a "disease,"
in the words of the findings of the trial court, the sweep
of that holding would still be startling. Such a ruling
would make it clear beyond any doubt that a. narcotics
addict could not be punished for "being" in possession
of drugs or, for that matter, for '"being" guilty of using
them. A wide variety of sex offenders would be immune
from punishment if they could show that their conduct
was not voluntary but part of the pattern of a disease.
More generally speaking, a form of the insanity defense
would be made a constitutional requirement throughout
the Nation, should the Court now hold it cruel and
unusual to punish a person afflicted with any mental
disease whenever his conduct was part of the pattern of
his disease and occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic
of the disease. Such a holding would appear to overrule Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), where the
majority opinion and the dissenting opinion in which
I joined both stressed the indefensibility of imposing
on the States any particular test of criminal responsibility. Id., at 800-801; id., at 803 (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting).
The impact of the holding urged upon us would, of
course, be greatest in those States which have until now

refused to accept any qualifications to the "right from
wrong" test of insanity; apparently at least 30 States
fall into this category.8 But even in States which have
recognized insanity defenses similar to the proposed new
constitutional rule, or where comparable defenses could
be presented in terms of the requirement of a guilty mind
(mens rea), the proposed new constitutional rule.would
be devastating, for constitutional questions would be.raised by every state effort to regulate the admissibility
of evidence relating to "disease" and "compulsion," and
by every state attempt to explain these concepts in
instructions to the jury. The test urged would make it
necessary to determine, not only what constitutes a
"disease," but also what is the "pattern" of the disease,
what "conditions" are "part" of the pattern, what parts
of this pattern result from a "compulsion," and finally
which of these compulsions are "symptomatic" of the
disease. The resulting confusion and uncertainty could$
easily surpass that experienced by the District of Columbia Circuit in attempting to give content to its similar,
though somewhat less complicated, test of insanity
The range of problems created would seem totally beyond
our capacity to settle at all, much less to settle wisely,
and even the attempt to define these terms and thus tW
impose constitutional and doctrinal rigidity seems absurd
in an area where our understanding is even today so

Perceptive students of history at an early date learned
that one country controlling another could do a more
successful job if it permitted the latter to keep in force
the laws and rules of conduct which it had adopted -for
itself. When our Nation was created by the Constitution of 1789, many people feared that the 13 straggling,
struggling States along the Atlantic composed too great
an area ever to be controlled from one central point. As
the years went on, however, the Nation crept cautiously
westward until it reached the Pacific Ocean and finally
the Nation planted its flag on the far-distant Islands
of Hawaii and on the frozen peaks of Alaska. During
all this period the Nation remembered that it could be
more tranquil and orderly if it functioned on the principle that the local communities should control their own
peculiarly local affairs under their own local rules.
This Court is urged to forget that lesson today. We
are asked to tell the most-distant Islands of Hawaii that
they cannot apply their local rules so as to protect a
drunken man on their beaches and the local communities
of Alaska that they are without power to follow their own
course in deciding what is the best way to take care
of a drunken man on their frozen soil. This Court,
instead of recognizing that the experience of human
beings is the best way to make laws, is asked to set itself
up as a board of Platonic Guardians to establish rigid,
binding rules upon every small community in this large
Nation for the control of the unfortunate people who fall
victim to drunkenness. It is always time to say that this
Nation is too large, too complex and composed of too
great a diversity of peoples for any one of us to have
the wisdom to establish the rules by which local Americans must govern their local affairs. The constitutional
rule we are urged to adopt is not merely revolutionary-

it departs from the ancient faith based on the premise
that experience in making local laws by local people
themselves is by far the safest guide for a nation like
ours to follow. I suspect this is a most propitious time
to remember the words of the late Judge Learned Hand,
who so wisely said:
"For myself it would be most irksome to be ruled
by a bevy of Platonic Guardians, even if I knew
how to choose them, which I assuredly do not."
L. Hand, The Bill of Rights 73 (1958).
I would confess the limits of my own ability to answer
the age-old questions of the criminal law's ethical foundations and practical effectiveness. I would hold that
Robinson v. California establishes a firm and impenetrable barrier to the punishment of persons who,. whatever their bare desires and propensities, have committed
no proscribed wrongful act. But I would refuse to
plunge from the concrete and almost universally recognized premises of Robinson into the murky problems
raised by the insistence that chronic alcoholics cannot be
punished for public drunkenness, problems that no
person, whether layman or expert, can claim to understand, and with consequences that no one can safely
predict. I join in affirmance of this conviction.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the result.
If it cannot be a crime to have an irresistible compulsion to use narcotics, Robinson v. California,370 U. S.
660, rehearing denied, 371 U. S. 905 (1962), I do not see
how it can constitutionally be a crime to yield to such a
compulsion. Punishing an addict for using drugs convicts
for addiction under a different name. Distinguishing between the two crimes is like forbidding criminal conviction
for being sick with flu or epilepsy but permitting punishment for running a fever or having a convulsion. Unless
'Robinson is to be abandoned, the use of narcotics by an

addict must be beyond the reach of the criminal law.
Similarly, the chronic alcoholic with an irresistible urge
to consume alcohol should not be punishable for drinking
or for being drunk.
Powell's conviction was for the different crime of being
drunk in a public place. Thus even if Powell was compelled to drink, and so could not constitutionally be convicted for drinking, his conviction in this case can be
invalidated only if there is a constitutional basis for saying that he may not be punished for being in public while
drunk. The statute involved here, which aims at keeping drunks off the street for their own welfare and that of
others, is not challenged on the ground that it interferes
unconstitutionally with the right to frequent public
places. No question is raised about applying this statute
to the nonchronic drunk, who has'no compulsion to
drink, who need not drink to excess, and who could
have arranged to do his drinking in private or, if he
began drinking in public, could have removed himself
at an appropriate point on the path toward complete
inebriation.
The trial court said that Powell was a chronic alcoholic
with a compulsion not only to drink to excess but also
to frequent public places when intoxicated. Nothing in
the record before the trial court supports the latter conclusion, which is contrary to common sense and to common knowledge., The sober chronic alcoholic has no
1The trial court gave no reasons for its conclusion that Powell
appeared in public due to "a compulsion symptomatic of the disease
of chronic alcoholism." No facts in the record support that conclusion. The trial transcript strongly suggests that the trial judge
merely adopted proposed findings put before him by Powell's counsel.
The fact that those findings were of no legal relevance in the trial
judge's view of the case is very significant for appraising the extent
to which they represented a well-considered and well-supported
judgment. For all these reasons I do not feel impelled to accept
this finding, and certainly would not rest a constitutional adjudication upon it.

compulsion to be on the public streets; many chronic
alcoholics drink at home and are never seen drunk in
public. Before and after taking the first drink, and until
he becomes so drunk that he loses the power to know
where he is or to direct his movements, the chronic alcoholic with a home or financial resources is as capable as
the nonchronic drinker of doing his drinking in private, of
removing himself from public places and, since he knows
or ought to know that he will become intoxicated, of
making plans to avoid his being found drunk in public.
For these reasons, I cannot say that the chronic alcoholic
who proves his disease and a compulsion to drink is
shielded from conviction when he has knowingly failed
to take feasible precautions against committing a criminal
act, here the act of going to or remaining in a public place.
On such facts the alcoholic is like a person with smallpox,
who could be convicted for being on the street but not
for being ill, or, like the epileptic, who could be punished
for driving a car but not for his disease.2
2

Analysis of this difficult case is not advanced by preoccupation

with the label "condition." In Robinson the Court dealt with "a
statute which'makes the 'status' of narcotic addiction a criminal
offense .

. . ."

370 U. S., at 666.

By precluding criminal convic-

tion for such a "status" the Court was dealing with a condition
brought about by acts remote in time from the application of the
criminal sanctions contemplated, a condition which was relatively
permanent in duration, and a condition of great magnitude and
significance in terms of human behavior and values. Although
the same May be said for the "condition" of being a chronic alcoholic,
it cannot be said for the mere transitory state of "being drunk
in public." "Being" drunk in public is not far removed in time
from the acts of "getting" drunk and "going" into public, and
it is not necessarily a state of any great duration. And, an isolated instance of "being" drunk in public is of relatively slight
importance in the life of an individual as compared with the condition of being a chronic alcoholic. If it werb necessary to di.tinguish between "acts" and "conditions" for purposes of the Eighth
Amendment, I would adhere to the concept of "condition' implicit

POWELL v. TEXAS.
514

Opinion of

WHIm, J.

The fact remains that some chronic alcoholics must
drink and hence must drink -somewhere.' Although
many chronics have homes, many others do-not. For all
practical purposes the public streets may be home for
these unfortunates, not because their disease compels
them to be there, but because, drunk or sober, they have
no place else to go and no place else to be when they
are drinking. This is more a function of economic station than of disease, although the disease may lead to
destitution and perpetuate that condition. For some of
these alcoholics I would think a showing could be made
that resisting drunkenness is impossible and that avoiding public places when intoxicated is also impossible.
As applied to them this statute is in effect a law which
bans a single act for which they may not be convicted
under the Eighth Amendment-the act of getting drunk.
It is also possible that the chronic alcoholic who begins
drinking in private at some point becomes so drunk that
in the opinion in Robinson; I would not trivialize that concept by
drawing a nonexistent line between the man who appears in public
drunk and that same man five minutes later who is then "being"
drunk in public. The proper subject of inquiry is whether volitional
acts brought about the "condition" and whether those acts are sufficiently proximate to the "condition" for it to be permissible to
impose penal sanctions on the "condition."
3The opinion of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL makes clear the limitations of our present knowledge of alcoholism and the disagreements
among doctors in their description and analysis of the disease. It
is also true that on the record before us there is some question
whether Powell possessed that degree of compulsion which alone.
would satisfy one of the prerequisites I deem essential to assertion
of an Eighth Amendment defense. It is nowhere disputed, however,
that there are chronic alcoholics whose need to consume alcohol in
large quantities is so persistent and so insistent that they are truly
compelled to drink. I find it unnecessary to attempt on this record
to determine whether or not Powell is such an alcoholic, for in my
view his attempt to claim the Eighth Amendment fails for other
reasons.

he loses the power to control his movements and for that
reason appears in public. The Eighth Amendment might
also forbid conviction in such circumstances, but only on
a record satisfactorily showing that it was not feasible
for him to have made arrangements to prevent his being
in public when drunk and that his extreme drunkenness
sufficiently deprived him of his faculties on the occasion
in issue.
These prerequisites to the possible invocation of the
Eighth Amendment are not satisfied on the record before
us. 4 Whether or not Powell established that he could
4 A holding that a person establishing the requisite facts could
not,
because of the Eighth Amendment, be criminally punished for appearing in public while drunk would be a novel construction of that
Amendment, but it would hardly have radical consequences. In the
first place, when as here the crime charged was being drunk in a
public place, only the compulsive 'chronic alcoholic would have a
defense to -both elements of the crime-for his drunkenness because
his disease compelled him to drink and for being in a public place
because the force of circumstances or excessive intoxication sufficiently deprived him of his mental and physical powers. The drinker
who was not compelled to drink, on the other hand, although he
might be as poorly circumstanced, equally intoxicated, and equally
without his physical powers, and cognitive faculties, could have
avoided drinking in the first place, could have avoided drinking to
excess, and need not have lost the power to manage his movements.
Perhaps the heavily intoxicated, compulsive alcoholic who could not
have arranged to avoid being in public places may not, consistent
with the Eighth Amendment, be convicted for being drunk in a
public place. However, it does not necessarily follow that it would
be unconstitutional to convict him for committing crimes involving

much greater risk to society.
Outside the area of alcoholism such a holding would not have

a wide impact. Concerning drugs, such a construction of the
Eighth Amendment would bar conviction only where the drug is
addictive and then only for acts Which are a necessary part of addiction, such as simple use. Beyond that it would preclude punishment
only when the addiction to or the use of drugs caused sufficient loss
of physical and mental faculties. This doctrine would not bar con-

not have resisted becoming drunk on December 19, 1966,
nothing in the record indicates that he could not have
done his drinking in private or that he was so inebriated
at the time that he had lost control of his movements
and wandered into the public street. Indeed, the evidence in the record strongly suggests that Powell could
have drunk at home and made plans while sober to prevent ending up in a public place. Powell had a home
and wife, and if there were reasons why he had to drink
in public or be drunk there, they do not appear in the
record.
Also, the only evidence bearing on Powell's condition
at the time of his arrest was the testimony of the arresting officer that appellant staggered, smelled of alcohol,
and was "very drunk." Powell testified that he had no
clear recollection of the situation at the time of his
arrest. His testimony about his usual condition when
drunk is no substitute for evidence about his condition
at the time of his arrest. Neither in the medical testimony nor elsewhere is there any indication that Powell
had reached such a state of intoxication that he had lost
the ability to comprehend, what he was doing or where
he was. For all we know from this record, Powell at
the time knew precisely where he was, retained the power
to stay off or leave the streets, and simply preferred to
be there rather than elsewhere.
It is unnecessary to pursue at this point the further
definition of the circumstances or the state of intoxication
which might bar. conviction of a chronic alcoholic for
being drunk in a public place. For the purposes of this
case, it is necessary to say only that Powell showed
nothing more than that he was to some degree compelled

in a public place (although other constitutional concepts might be
relevant to such a conviction), or for committing other criminal acts.

Appellant was charged with being- found in a state of
intoxication in a public place. This is a violation of
Article 477 of the Texas Penal Code, which reads as
follows:
"Whoever shall get drunk or be found in a state of
intoxication in any public place, or at any private
house except his own, shall be fined not exceeding
one hundred dollars."
Appellant was tried in the Corporation Court of Austin.,
Texas. He was found guilty and fined $20. He appealed to the County Court at Law No. 1 of Travis
County, Texas, where a trial de novo was held. Appellant was defended by counsel who urged that appellant
was "afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism

constant, excessive consumption of alcohol; his appearI do not question the power of the State to remove a helplessly intoxicated person from a public street, although against
his will, and to hold him until he has regained his powers. The
person's own safety and the public interest require this much.
A statute such as the one challenged in this case is constitutional

insofar as it authorizes a police officer to arrest any seriously intoxicated person when he is encountered in a public place. Whether
such a person may be charged and convicted for violating the
statute will depend upon whether he is entitled to the protection
of the Eighth Amendment.

ance in public in that condition is not of his own volition,
but a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic
alcoholism." Counsel contended that to penalize appellant for public intoxication would be to inflict upon
him cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.
At the trial in the county court, the arresting officer
testified that he had observed appellant in the 2000 block
of Hamilton Street in Austin; that appellant staggered
when he walked; that his speech was slurred; and that he
smelled strongly of alcohol. He was not loud or boisterous; he did not resist arrest; he was cooperative with
the officer.
The defense established that appellant had been convicted of public intoxication approximately 100 times
since 1949, primarily in Travis County, Texas. The circumstances were always the same: the "subject smelled
strongly of alcoholic beverages, staggered when walking,
speech incoherent." At the end of the proceedings, he
would be fined: "down in Bastrop County, it's $25.00
down there, and it's $20.00 up here [in Travis County]."
Appellant was usually unable to pay the fines imposed
for these offenses, and therefore usually has been obliged
to work the fines off in jail. The statutory rate for working off such fines in Texas is one day in jail for each $5
of fine unpaid. Texas Code Crim. Proc., Art. 43.09.
Appellant took the stand. He testified that he works.
.at a tavern shining shops. He makes about $12 a week
which he uses to buy wine. He has a family, but he
does not contribute to its support. He drinks wine every
day. He gets drunk about once a week. When he gets
drunk, he usually goes to sleep, "mostly" in public places
such as the sidewalk. He dloes not disturb the peace
or interfere with others.

The defense called as a witness Dr. David Wade, a
Fellow of the American Medical Association and a former
President of the Texas Medical Association. Dr. Wade
is a qualified doctor of medicine, duly certificated in psychiatry. He has been engaged in the practice of psychiatry for more than 20 years. During all of that time
he has been especially interested in the problem of alcoholism. He has treated alcoholics; lectured and written
on the subject; and has observed the work of various
institutions in treating alcoholism. Dr. Wade testified
that he had observed and interviewed the appellant.
He said that appellant has a history of excessive drinking
dating back to his early years; that appellant drinks only
wine and beer; that "he rarely passes a week without
going on an alcoholic binge"; that "his consumption of
alcohol is limited only by his finances, and when he is
broke, he makes an effort to secure alcohol by getting
his friends to buy alcohol for him"; that he buys a "fifty
cent bottle" of wine, always with the thought that this is
all he will drink; but that he ends by drinking all he can
buy until he "is ...passed out in some joint or out on the
sidewalk." According to Dr. Wade, appellant "has never
engaged in any activity that is destructive to society or
to anyone except himself." He has never received medical or psychiatric treatment for his drinking problem.
He has never been referred to Alcoholics Anonymous,
a.voluntary association for helping alcoholics, nor has he
ever been sent to the State Hospital.
Dr. Wade's conclusion was that "Leroy Powell is an
alcoholic and that his alcoholism is in a chronic stage."
Although the doctor responded affirmatively to a question as to whether the appellant's taking the first drink
on any given occasion is "a voluntary exercise of will,"
his testimony was that "we must take into account"
the fact that chronic alcoholics have a "compulsion" to
drink which "while not completely overpowering, is a

very strong influence, an exceedingly strong influence,"
and that this compulsion is coupled with the "firm belief
in their mind that they are going to be able to handle
it from now on." It was also Dr. Wade's opinion that
appellant "has an uncontrollable compulsion to drink"
and that he "does not have the willpower [to resist the
constant excessive consumption of alcohol or to avoid
appearing in public when intoxicated] nor has he been
.given medical treatment to enable him to develop this
willpower."
The trial judge in the county court, sitting without
a jury, made the following findings of fact:
"(1) That chronic alcoholism is a disease which
destroys the afflicted person's will power to resist
the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol.
"(2) That a chronic alcoholic does not appear in
public by his own volition but under a compulsion
symptomatic of tile disease of chronic alcoholism.

about the circumstances surrounding the drinking bout which re1I

(Opinion of MARSHALL, J., ante, at 521-522). We do not "traditionally" sit as a trial court, much less as a finder of fact. I submit
that we must accept the findings of the trial court as they were made

and not as the members of this Court would have made them had
they sat as triers of fact. I would add, lest I create a misunder-

standing, that I do not suggest in this opinion that Leroy Powell
had a constitutional right, based upon the evidence adduced at his
tridl, to the findings of fact that were made by the county court;

only that once such findings were in fact made, it became the duty
of the trial court to apply the relevant legal principles and to declare

that appellant's conviction would be constitutionally invalid. See
infra, at 567-570.
I confess, too, that I do not understand the relevance of our
knowing very little "about alcoholism itself," given what we do

The court then rejected appellant's constitutional defense, entering the following conclusion of law:
"(1) The fact that a person is a chronic alcoholic
afflicted with the disease of chronic alcoholism, is
not a defense to being charged with the offense
of getting drunk or being found in a state of intoxication in any public place under Art. 477 of the
Texas Penal Code."

to appeal further within the Texas judicial system. Tex.

statement in this Court.

The issue posed in this case is a narrow one. There is
no challenge here to the validity of public intoxication
statutes in general or to the Texas public intoxication
statute in particular. This case does not concern the
infliction of punishment upon the "social" drinker--or
upon anyone other than a "chronic alcoholic" who, as the
trier of fact here found, cannot "resist the consent, excessive consumption of alcohol." Nor does it relAte to any
offense other than the crime of public intoxication.
The sole question presented-is whether a criminal penalty may be imposed upon a person suffering the disease
of "chronic alcoholism" for a condition-being "in a state
of intoxication" in public-which is a characteristic part
of the pattern of his disease and which, the trial court
found, was not the consequence of appellant's volition but
of "a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic
alcoholism." We must consider whether the Eighth
Amendment, made applicable to the States through the
krow-that findings such as those made in this case are, in the
view of competent medical authorities, perfectly plausible. See
infra, at 560-562.

POWELL v. TEXAS.

FORTAS,

J., dissenting.

Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the imposition of this
penalty in these rather special circumstances as "cruel
and unusual punishment." This case does not raise any
question as to the right of the police to stop and detain
those who are intoxicated in public, whether as a result
of the disease or otherwise; or as to the State's power
to commit chronic alcoholics for treatment. Nor does
it concern the responsibility of an alcoholic for criminal
acts. We deal here with the mere condition of being
intoxicated in public.2
II.
As I shall discuss, consideration of the Eighth Amendment issue in this case requires an understanding of "the
disease of chronic alcoholism" with which, as the trial
court found, appellant is afflicted, which has destroyed his
"will power to resist the constant, excessive consumption
of alcohol," and which leads him to "appear in public
[not] by his own volition but under a compulsion symptomatic of the disease of chronic alcoholism." It is true,
of course, that there is a great deal that remains to be discovered about chronic alcoholism. Although many aspects of the disease remain obscure, there are some hard
facts--medical and, especially, legal facts-that are accessible to us and that provide a context in which the
instant case may be analyzed. We are similarly woefully
deficient in our medical, diagnostic, and therapeutic
2

It

is not

foreseeable that findings such as those which are

decisive here-namely that the appellant's being intoxicated in public was a part of the pattern of his disease and due to a compulsion
symptomatic of that disease-could or would be made in the case
of offenses such as driving a car while intoxicated, assault, theft, or
robbery. Such offenses require independent acts or conduct and
do not typically flow from and are not part of the syndrome of the
disease of chronic alcoholism. If an alcoholic should be convicted
for criminal conduct which is not a characteristic and involuntary
part of the pattern of the disease as it afflicts him, nothing herein
would prevent his punishment.

but few would urge that, because of this, we should
totally reject the legal significance of what we do know
about these phenomena.
Alcoholism I is a major problem in the United States.
In 1956 the American Medical Association for the first
time designated alcoholism as a major medical problem
and urged that alcoholics be admitted to general hospitals
for' care.8 This significant development marked the acceptance among the medical profession of the "disease
concept of alcoholism."' Although there is some probThe term has been variously defined. The National Council on
Alcoholism has defined "alcoholic" as "a person who is powerless to
stop drinking and whose drinking seriously alters his normal living
pattern." The American Medical Association has defined alcoholics
as "those excessive drinkers whose dependence on alcohol has attained such a degree that it shows a noticeable disturbance or interference with their bodily or mental health, their interpersonal
relations, and their satisfactory social and economic functioning."

lem in defining the concept, its core meaning, as agreed
by authorities, is that alcoholism is caused and maintained by something other than the moral fault of the
alcoholic, something that, to a greater or lesser extent
depending upon the physiological or psychological makeup and history of the individual, cannot be controlled
by him. Today most alcohologists and qualified members of the medical profession recognize the validity of
this concept. Recent years have seen an intensification
of medical interest in the subject.! Medical groups have
become active in educating the public, medical schools,
and physicians in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment
of alcoholism.'
Authorities have recognized that a number of factors may contribute to alcoholism. Some studies have
pointed to physiological influences, such as vitamin deficiency, hormone imbalance, abnormal metabolism, and
hereditary proclivity. Other researchers have found
more convincing a psychological approach, emphasizing
early environment and underlying conflicts and tensions.
Numerous studies have indicated the influence of sociocultural factors. It has been shown, for example, that
the incidence of alcoholism among certain ethnic groups
is far higher than among others.9

The manifestations of alcoholism are reasonably well
identified. The late E. M. Jellinek, an eminent alcohologist, has described five discrete types commonly
found among American alcoholics." It is well established that alcohol may be habituative and "can be physically addicting." 11. It has been said that "the main
point for the nonprofessional is that alcoholism is not
within the control of the person involved. He is not
willfully drinking." 12
Although the treatment of alcoholics has been succesful in many cases, s physicians have been unable to discover any single treatment method that will invariably
produce satisfactory results. A recent study of available
treatment facilities concludes as follows: 14
"Although ,numerous kinds of therapy and intervention appear to have been effective with various
kinds of problem drinkers, the process of matching
patient and treatment method is not yet highly
developed. There is an urgent need for continued
experimentation, for modifying and improving exist" See E. Jellinek, The Disease Concept of Alcoholism 35-41 (1960).

1s In response to the question "can a chronic alcoholic be inedically treated and returned to society as a useful citizen?" Dr. Wade
testified as follows:
"We believe that it is possible to treat alcoholics, and we have
large numbers of individuals who are now former alcoholics. They
themselves would rather say that their condition has been arrested
and that they remain alcoholics, that they are simply living a
pattern of life, through the help of medicine or whatever source,
that enables them to refrain from drinking and enables them to
combat the compulsion to drink."

ing treatment methods, for developing new ones,
and for careful and well-designed evaluative studies.
Most of the facilities that provide services for alcoholics have made little, if any, attempt to determine
the effectiveness of the total program or of its
components."
Present services for alcoholics include state and general
hospitals, separate state alcoholism programs, outpatient
clinics, community health centers, general practitioners,
and private psychiatric facilities. 15 Self-help organizations, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, also aid in
treatment and rehabilitation.'
The consequences of treating alcoholics, under the public intoxication laws, as criminals can be identified with
more specificity. Public drunkenness is punished as a
crime, under a variety of laws and ordinances, in every
State of the Union." The Task Force on Drunkenness of
the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice has reported that "[t]wo million
arrests in 1965-one of every three arrests in Americawere for the offense of public drunkenness." Is Drunkenness offenders make up a large percentage of the population in short-term penal institutions. 9 Their arrest and
processing place a tremendous burden upon the police,
who are called upon to spend a large amount of time

at trials for public intoxication, and upon the entire
criminal process."
It is not known how many drunkenness offenders are
chronic alcoholics, but "[t]here is strong evidence . . .
that a large number of those who are arrested have a
lengthy history of prior drunkenness arrests." 21 "There
are instances of the same person being arrested as many
as forty times in a single year on charges of drunkenness,
and every large urban center can point to cases of individuals appearing before the courts on such charges 125,
150, or even 200 times in the course of a somewhat longer
period." 22
It is entirely clear that the jailing of chronic alcoholics
is punishment. It is not defended as therapeutic, nor is
there any basis for claiming that it is therapeutic (or
indeed a deterrent). The alcoholic offender is caught in
a "revolving door"-leading from arrest on the street
through a brief, unprofitable sojourn in jail, back to the
street and, eventually, another arrest.23 The jails, overcrowded and put to a use for which they are not suit20

Finally, most commentators, as well as experienced
judges,25 are in agreement that "there is probably no
dreUrier example of the futility of using penal sanctions
to solve a psychiatric problem than the enforcement of
the laws against drunkenness." 26
"If all of this effort, all of this investment of time
and money, were producing constructive results, then
we might find satisfaction in the situation despite
its costs. But the fact is that this activity accomplishes little that is fundamental. No one can seriously suggest that the threat of fines and jail sentences actually deters habitual drunkenness or
alcoholic addiction. . . . Nor, despite the heroic
efforts being made in a few localities, is there much
reason to suppose that any very effective measures

may be inflicted, and, if so, whether, in the case now
before us, those principles preclude the imposition of
such punishment.
It is settled that the Federal Constitution places some
substantive limitation upon the power of state legislatures to define crimes for which the imposition of
punishment is ordered. In Robinson v. California,370
U. S. 660 (1962), the Court considered a conviction
under a California statute making it a criminal offense
for a person to "be addicted to the use of narcotics."
At Robinson's trial, it was developed that the defendant
had bebn a user of narcotics. The trial court instructed
the jury that "[t]o be addicted to the use of narcotics is
said to be a status or condition and not an act. It is a
continuing offense and differs from most other offenses
in the fact that [it] is chronic rather than acute; that
it continues after it is complete and subjects the offender
to arrest at any time before be reforms." Id., at 662-663.
This Court reversed Robinson's conviction on the
ground that punishment under the law in question was
cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution as applied to the States through
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court noted that narcotic addiction is considered to be an illness and that
California had recognized it as such. It held that the
State could not make it a crime for a person to be ill.28
Although Robinson had been sentenced to only 90 days
in prison for his offense, it was beyond the power of the
State to prescribe such punishment. As MR. JUSTICE
STEWART, speaking for the Court, said: "[e]ven one day
2s "We would forget the teachings of the Eighth Amendment if
we allowed sickness to be made a crime and permitted sick people
to be punished for being sick. This age of enlightenment cannot
tolerate such barbarous action." 370 U. S., at 678 (DouGLAs, J.,
concurring).

in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for
the 'crime' of having a common cold." 370 U. S., at 667.
Robinson stands upon a principle which, despite its
subtlety, must be simply, stated and respectfully applied
because it is the foundation of individual liberty and the
cornerstone of the relations between a civilized state and
its citizens: Criminal penalties may not be inflicted upon
a person for being in a condition he is powerless to change.
In all probability, Robinson at some time before his
conviction elected to take narcotics. , But the crime as
defined did not punish this conduct.29 The statute imposed a penalty for the offense of "addiction"-a condition which Robinson could not control. Once Robinson
had become an addict, he was utterly powerless to avoid
criminal guilt. He was powerless to choose not to violate
the law.
In the present case, appellant is charged with a crime
composed of two elements--being intoxicated and'being
found in a public place while in that condition. The
crime, So defined, differs from that in Robinson. The
statute covers more than a mere status." But the essen29

The Court noted in Robinson that narcotic addiction "is apparently an illness which may be contracted innocently or involuntarily." Id., at 667. In the case of alcoholism it is even more
likely that the disease may be innocently contracted, since the drink-

ing of alcoholic beverages is a common activity, generally accepted
in our society, while the purchasing and taking of drugs are crimes.
As in Robinson, the State has not argued here that Powell's conviction may be supported by his "voluntary" action in becoming
afflicted.
80 In Robinson, we distinguished between punishment for the
"status" of addiction and punishment of an "act":
"This statute . . .is not one which punishes a 'person for the use

of narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial
or disorderly behavior resulting from their administration. It is
not a law which even purports to provide or require medical treat-

ment. Rather, we deal with a statute which makes the 'status'

tial constitutional defect here is the same as in Robinson,

for in both cases the patticular defendant was accused of
being in a condition which he had no capacity to change
or avoid. The trial judge sitting as trier of fact found,
upon the medical and other relevant testimony, that
Powell is a "chronic alcoholic." He defined appellant's
"chronic alcoholism" as "a disease which destroys the
afflicted person's will power to resist the constant, excessive consumption of alcohol." He also found that "a
chronic alcoholic does not appear in public by his own
volition but under a compulsion symptomatic of the
disease of chronic alcoholism." I read these findings
to mean that appellant was powerless to avoid drinking;
that having taken his first drink, he had "an uncontrollable compulsion to drink" to the point of intoxication; and that, once intoxicated, he could not prevent
31
himself from appearing in public places.

of narcotic addition a criminal offense, for which the offender may
be prosecuted 'at any time before he reforms.' California has said
that a person can be continuously guilty of this offense, whether
or not he has ever used or possessed any narcotics within the State,
and whether or not he has been guilty of any antisocial behavior
there." Id., at 666.
311 also read these findings to mean that appellant's disease
is such that he cannot be deterred by Article 477 of the Texas
Penal Code from drinking to excess and from appearing in public
while intoxicated. See n. 23, supra.
'Finally, contrary to the views of MR. JUSTICE WHITE, ante, at 549551, I believe these findings must fairly be read to encompass the
facts that my Brother WHITE agrees would require reversal, that is,
that for appellant Powell, "resisting drunkenness" and "avoiding
public places when intoxicated" on the occasion in question were
"impossible." Accordingly, in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's words, "[the]
statute is in effect a law which bans a single act for which [he] may
not be convicted under the Eighth Amendment-the act of getting
drunk." In my judgment, the findings amply show that "it was not
feasible for [Powell] to have made arrangements to prevent his being
in public when drunk and that tiis extreme drunkennesss sufficiently
deprived him of his faculties on the occasion in issue."

FORTAS,

Article 477 of the Texas Penal Code is specifically
directed to the accused's presence while in a state of
intoxication, "in any public place, or at any private house
except his own." This is the essence of the crime. Ordinarily when the State proves such presence in a state of
intoxication, this will be sufficient for conviction, and the
punishment prescribed by the State may, of course, be
validly imposed. But here the findings of the trial judge
call into play the principle that a person may not be punished if the condition essential to constitute the defined
crime is part of the pattern of his disease and is occasioned by a compulsion symptomatic of the disease.
This principle, narrow in scope and applicability, is
implemented by the Eighth Amendment's prohibition
of "cruel and unusual punishment," as we construed that
command in Robinson. It is true that the command
of the Eighth Amendment and its antecedent provision
in the Bill of Rights of' 1689 were initially directed to
the type and degree of punishment inflicted. 2 But in
Robinson we recognized that "the principle that would
deny power to exact capital punishment for a petty
crime would also deny power to punish a person by
fine or imprisonment for being sick." 370 U. S., at 676
(MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring) .3
The findings in this case, read against the background
of the medical and sociological data to which I have
referred, compel the conclusion that the infliction upon
appellant of a criminal penalty for being intoxicated in

Unusual Punishment Clause"ahd the Substantive Criminal Law, 79

3 Convictions of chronic alcoholics for violations of public intoxication statutes have been invalidated on Eighth Amendment grounds
in two circuits. See Easter v. District of Columbia, 124 U. S. App.

a public place would be "cruel and inhuman punishment"
within the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment. This
conclusion follows because appellant is a "chronic alcoholic" who, according to the trier of fact, cannot resist
the "constant excessive consumption of alcohol" and
does not appear in public by his own volition but under
a "compulsion" which is part of his condition.
I would reverse the judgment below.
