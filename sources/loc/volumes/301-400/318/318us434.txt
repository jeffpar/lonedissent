CORN EXCHANGE NATIONAL BANK & TRUST
CO. ET AL. v. KLAUDER, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 452. Argued February 2, 3, 1943.-Decided March 8, 1943.
Within four months of bankruptcy the debtor had assigned accounts
receivable as security for concurrent loans. Notice to those who
owed the accounts was not given, although under applicable local
law notice was necessary in order to preclude possible superior

rights in subsequent bona fide purchasers of the accounts. Held,
that the assignments were preferential under § 60 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act and thus avoidable by the trustee in bankruptcy under
§ 60 (b) thereof. P. 439.
129 F. 2d 24, 894, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 317 U. S. 617, to review the reversal of an
order of the bankruptcy court which affirmed orders of the
Referee allowing certain claims of the petitioners as secured claims against the bankrupt estate.

Mr. Charles J. Biddle, with whom Messrs. Maurice
Bower Saul, William E. Mikell, Jr., Allen S. Olmsted, 2d,
and James McMullan were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Bertram Bennett, with whom Mr. Rawdon Libby
was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case requires us to determine the application of
the preference provisions of § 60 (a) of the Bankruptcy
Act as amended by the Chandler Act of June 22, 1938,' to
loans made on assignments of accounts receivable.

Opinion of the Court.

The Quaker City, Sheet Metal Company became embarrassed for want of working capital in 1938. Creditors
representing a large percentage of claims later proved in
bankruptcy agreed to subordinate their claims to those
which might be incurred for new working capital. A
creditor's committee took supervision of the business and
in 1938 arranged with the petitioner Bank to advance
from time to time money for payroll and other needs on
concurrently made assignments of accounts receivable.
At the time of bankruptcy the Company was indebted
to the Bank for loans so made on contemporary assignments between January 19, 1940, and April 5, 1940. On
April 12, 1940, petitioner Dearden made a loan on similar security. An involuntary petition in bankruptcy
was filed against the Company on April 18, 1940, followed
by adjudication on May 7, 1940. When the assignments
were made they were recorded on the Company's books,
but neither petitioner had ever given notice of assignment to the debtors whose obligations had been taken as
security. Because of this omission the trustee challenged
their right to the benefits of their security. He was overruled by the referee and the District Court, but his position was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit,' on an interpretation of § 60 (a) which
conflicts with an interpretation by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.' Hence we granted
certiorari.'
Section 60 (a) as amended and applicable reads:
"A preference is a transfer, as defined in this Act, of any
of the property of a debtor to or for the benefit of a creditor for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by such debtor while insolvent and within four

months before the filing by or against him of the petition
in bankruptcy, . . .the effect of which transfer will be
to enable such creditor to obtain a greater percentage of
his debt than some other creditor of the same class. For
the purposes of subdivisions a and b of this section, a transfer shall be deemed to have been made at the time when
it became so far perfected that no bona-fide purchaser
from the debtor and no creditor could thereafter have acquired any rights in the property so transferred superior
to the rights of the transferee therein, and, if such transfer
is not so perfected prior to the filing of the petition in
bankruptcy . . ., it shall be deemed to have been made
immediately before bankruptcy."
Section 1 (30) specifically provides that "transfer" includes an assignment."
The Circuit Court of Appeals has determined, and we
accept its conclusion, that at all relevant times it was the
law of Pennsylvania, where these transactions took place,
that because of the failure of these assignees to give notice
to the debtors whose obligations were taken, a subsequent
good-faith assignee, giving such notice, would acquire a
right superior to theirs.' It held that the assignments
were preferences under § 60 (a) and therefore, under the
terms of § 60 (b),' inoperative against the trustee.
This is undoubtedly the effect of a literal reading of the
Act. Its apparent command is to test the effectiveness
of a transfer, as against the trustee, by the standards which

applicable state law' would enforce against a good-faith
purchaser. Only when such a purchaser is precluded from
obtaining superior rights is the trustee so precluded. So
long as the transaction is left open to possible intervening
rights to such a purchaser, it is vulnerable to the intervening bankruptcy. By thus postponing the effective time
of the transfer, the debt, which is effective when actually
made, will be made antecedent to the delayed effective
date of the transfer and therefore will be made a preferential transfer in law, although in fact made concurrently
with the advance of money. In this case the transfers,
good between the parties, had never been perfected as
against good-faith purchasers by notice to the debtors
as the law required, and so the conclusion follows from
this reading of the Act that the petitioners lose their security under the preference prohibition of § 60 (b).
Such a construction is capable of harsh results,9 and it
is said that it will seriously hamper the business of "nonnotification financing," of which the present case is an instance. This business is of large magnitude and it is said
to be of particular benefit to small and struggling borrow8 Questions of this sort arising in bankruptcy cases were solved
by reference to state law even before the decision of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64. Holt v. Crucible Steel Co., 224 U. S. 262;
Benedict v. Ratner, 268 U. S. 353. The decision in Salem Trust Co.
v. Manufacturers'Finance Co., 264 U. S. 182, that, as a matter of "general law," absence of notice to the debtor of the assignment of his
account did not open the door to a subsequent assignee to obtain
superior rights, was not rendered in a bankruptcy case, and is in any
event inapplicable since the decision of the Tompkins case.

Whether the petitioners have any rights under the agreement of
some of the creditors to subordinate their claims to those which might
be incurred for new working capital is a question which has neither
been raised by the parties nor considered by the Court.

serious, but we find nothing in Congressional policy which
warrants taking this case out of the letter of the Act.
The Committee of the House of Representatives which
reported § 60 (a) as quoted above was fully aware of the
vicissitudes of its predecessors." These are recited in detail elsewhere, and need not be repeated here beyond a
general statement that for thirty-five years Congress has
consistently reached out to strike down secret transfers,
and the courts have with equal consistency found its
efforts faulty or insufficient to that end.' Against such a

for an estimate that in 1941 commercial finance companies advanced
$536,000,000 on this basis; and commercial banks, $952,000,000. Of
the borrowers, it was estimated that 63% had total (not net) assets
of less than $200,000; and 31%, less than $50,000. Their borrowing
was estimated, however, to amount to less than 19% of the total.

1 See statement of Professor McLaughlin, Hearings, Revision of
the Bankruptcy Act, House Judiciary Committee, 75th Cong., 1st

as applying a rule of state law that a mortgagee by taking possession
of the mortgaged property at a time subsequent to the execution of
the mortgage thereby validated it as of the time of execution. He
said that § 60 (a) would prevent such validation by relation back.
Similar disapproving reference was made to Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., 239 U. S. 268; Carey v. Donohue, 240 U. S. 430; and Martin v. Commercial National Bank, 245 U. S. 513; with the explanation that "You are going to have taken away some advantages that
some people have enjoyed, and certain practices are going to be altered
to some extent. But you have that every time you pass any kind of a
commercial law."

background, § 60 (a) was drawn and reported to Congress
with this explanation of its purpose and effect: "The new
test is more comprehensive and accords with the contemplated purpose of striking down secret liens. It is provided that the transfer shall be deemed to have been made
when it has become so far perfected that neither a bonafide purchaser nor creditor could thereafter have acquired
rights superior to those of the transferee. As thus
drafted, it includes a failure to record and any other
ground which could be asserted by a bona-fide purchaser
or a creditor of the transferor, as against the transferee.
A provision also has been added which makes the test
effective even though the transfer may never have actually
become perfected." 13
Whatever advantages may inhere in non-notification
financing which might have made Congress reluctant to
jeopardize it, the system also has characteristics which
make it impossible for us to conclude that it is to be distinguished from the secret liens Congress was admittedly
trying to reach.

similar amount is not available through other channels."4

Interest and other charges are high,1 5 and an assignment
often is correctly understood as a symptom of financial
distress.16 The borrower does not wish his customers to
learn of his borrowing arrangement for the reason, among
others, that customers, particularly in placing orders for
future delivery, prefer to rely on solvent suppliers. And
often the borrower desires to conceal the fact that he is
being financed by this method, lest knowledge lead to a
withdrawal of further credit or refusal of new credit. 7
The borrower and the lender on assigned accounts receivable thus have a mutual interest in not making the
transaction known. So long as the transaction may remain
a secret, it is not apt to become known to the trade. When
the transaction is communicated to the trade debtors it is
known where there is less motive to keep it under cover.
Commercial and trade reporting agencies are diligent to
rates are estimated to range from approximately 9% per
annum on money in use for the best borrowers to 20% per annum for
those whose accounts present the financing company with the heaviest
operating costs and whose receivables are of a quality to command
only a relatively low percentage advance. Id. at 86, 131 et seq.
10 Id. at 22, 99.
17"Another reason for the use of the non-notification procedure, although less important than other motives and less relevant at present
than formerly, seems to have been the desire on the part of the concern
being financed to keep the fact of its use of this source of funds from
becoming known to its creditors. Presumably these creditors would be
less likely to grant the concern further credit on the ground that resort
to accounts receivable financing reflected an unsatisfactory financial
position and impaired their own security. It seems likely that this
attitude toward non-notification financing may be traced to a mixture
of simple prejudice and genuine experience with cases where creditors'
meetings disclosed for the first time that the bankrupt had secretly
assigned his most liquid assets and made unproductive use of the funds
so acquired. Genuine experience must have been the more important
basis of the two for it is unlikely that an attitude and prejudice so
deeply embedded could be founded entirely on misinformation and
irrational judgment." Id. at 22.

obtain credit information of this character. Its dissemination may often have adverse effects upon both the
borrower and the lender, but they are not the only interested parties. Secrecy has the effect of inducing others
to go along with the borrower in ignorance, where they
would not do so if informed.
It is said that assignments such as are involved in this
case could not have been within the contemplation of the
Act, since its application will have but little effect in remedying whatever secrecy attends them. It is true that
notice to the debtors sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of applicable state law might never have been communicated to the creditors, and that many states do not require
notice to the debtor to foreclose possible superior rights of
subsequent assignees. 8 So also is it true that conflicts and
confusion may result where the transaction or location of
the parties is of such a nature that doubt arises as to which
of different state laws is applicable. But the fact that the
remedy may fall short in these respects does not justify
denying it all effect.
That the assignments in this case were made with the
knowledge and acquiescence of many creditors does not
cure the failure to meet the requirements of notice laid
down by the applicable state law. Neither the words nor
the policy of § 60 (a) afford any warrant for creating exceptions to fit isolated hard cases.

Argued February 11, 12, 1943.--Decided March 15, 1943.

1. The decision of the District Court in this case, setting aside an
indictment for violation of the Sherman Act, rests not alone upon
a construction of the statute but also upon the independent ground
of the insufficiency of the indictment as a pleading, and it is
therefore not appealable directly to this Court under the Criminal
Appeals Act. P. 444.
2. Pursuant to the Act of May 9, 1942, the cause is remanded to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, which thereupon will have authority
to pass upon the construction of both the indictment and the statute.
