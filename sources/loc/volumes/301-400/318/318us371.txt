HELVERING v. GRIFFITHS.
Opinion of the Court.

HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. GRIFFITHS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 467.

Argued December 7, 1942.-Decided March 1, 1943.

A holder of common stock in a corporation which had but the one class
of stock outstanding received, in 1939, stock dividends (based on
earnings and profits subsequent to February 28, 1913) in common
stock identical with the stock on which they were declared. The
dividend stock was in no way realized upon in 1939. Held, upon
consideration of the legislative history and administrative construction, that Congress, by §§ 22 (a) and 115 (f) (1) of the Internal
Revenue Code, did not intend to tax such stock dividends; and that
there is no occasion to reconsider Eisner v. M8iomber, 252 U. S. 189.
Pp. 372, 404.

Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, and pass on the Government's request that it be overruled.
During the calendar year 1939 respondent owned 101
shares of common stock of the Standard Oil Company of
New Jersey. Twice during the year that corporation
made appropriate transfers from earned surplus to its
capital accounts, in amounts less than the net accumulation of earnings and profits subsequent to February 28,
1913, and against them issued stock dividends. On June
15, 1939, respondent received a dividend of 1.01 such
shares having a fair market value of $42.93. On December 15, 1939, she received a further dividend of 1.53 shares,
which had a fair market value of $66.08. These dividends were in common stock identical with the stock on
which they were declared, which was the only stock outstanding at the time they were made. The dividend
stock was not sold, redeemed, or in any way realized upon,
and the taxpayer did not include it as income in her return
for 1939. The Commissioner did so include it, and on
December 8, 1941, sent her a notice of deficiency in the
amount of $9.60. The Board of Tax Appeals reversed
his determination, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed on the authority of Eisner v,
Macomber, supra. 129 F. 2d 321. Because of the importance of the question we granted certiorari.
The tax is asserted under the general provision of § 22
(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that income includes
"dividends," together with the specific provision of § 115
(f) (1) that: "A distribution made by a corporation to its
shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock
shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does
not constitute income to the shareholder within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution." 1
153 Stat. 1, 9, 47. Sec. 22 (a) provides that "'Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from . . . dividends . . ."
See. 115 (a) provides that "The term 'dividend' . . . means any

distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders, whether in
money or in other property. . .

."

HELVERING v. GRIFFITHS.
371

Opinion of the Court.

Was Congress thereby saying that such a dividend as we
have here is not being taxed, in view of the Eisner v. Macomber decision, or was it saying that regardless of that
decision it is being taxed? Events which must be. considered to determine which Congress intended begin with
the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1913, which taxed
corporate "dividends" in general but said nothing of stock
dividends in particular. The Treasury attempted to tax
them, and this Court held that a dividend of common stock
paid on stock of the same kind was not income within the
meaning of the Act, intimating, however, that as used in
the Sixteenth Amendment "income" might have a wider
scope. Towne v. Eisner, 245 U. S. 418 (1918). Congress
had meanwhile provided that a "stock dividend shall be
considered income, to the amount of its cash value." '
Under that Act the Commissioner asserted that a dividend
in common stock paid on common stock constituted income when received. This Court held it was not income
within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment, chiefly
for the reason that income had not been severed from capital or realized by such a distribution. Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189 (1920). This decision was by a divided
Court, Justices Holmes and Brandeis each writing a dissenting opinion, in which respectively Justices Day and
Clarke joined. It was promptly and sharply criticised. 4

Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S

Although Eisner v. Macomber dealt only with a dividend
of common stock to common stockholders, it was at once
accepted as the basis for a broader exemption. The Treasury ruled that receipt of dividend stock generally was not
income, and Congress provided in § 201 (d) of the Revenue
Act of 1921 that "A stock dividend shall not be subject to
tax . . ." I Treasury Regulations under this statute and

subsequent reenactments construed it as covering all dividends paid in stock of the distributing corporation.
There the matter stood for nearly fifteen years, although
in the meantime this Court pointed out in reorganization
cases that a distinction existed between the type of stock
dividend before it in Eisner v. Macomber and one which
gave the stockholder a different stock, or different proportionate interests, than before. United States v. Phells, 257 U. S. 156 (1921) ; Rockefeller v. United States, 257

Opinion of the Court.

Inaction did not mean, however, that persons who received stock dividends were escaping all support of the
revenues. Taxation was only postponed, as is taxation of
many securities taken in corporate reorganizations, until
sale or other realization has occurred. Their proceeds
when realized have always been taxable as income. The
Treasury had come to compute the postponed tax under
Regulations which as to some classes of stock apportioned
the cost basis between the old stock and the dividend stock
in accordance with their respective fair market values at
the time the stock dividend was issued." On March 30,
1936, this Court granted certiorari in Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441, in which the taxpayer challenged the
validity of the apportionment Regulations. 297 U. S.
702. She had owned certain preferred stock and had received a dividend of common shares thereon. The preferred was thereafter redeemed, and the Commissioner
applied the allocation rule, which reduced the cost basis
of this old stock. This, of course, increased her gain on
the redemption of the old stock and added to her tax.
She argued that her dividend, notwithstanding Eisner v.
Macomber, to which she gave a narrow reading, was constitutionally taxable as income at the time received. The
Court held unanimously and squarely that the dividend
in question did constitute income within the Sixteenth
Amendment, and in effect limited Eisner v. Macomber to
the kind of dividend there dealt with. But it did not overrule that decision or question its authority as to dividends
such as we have in this case. With two Justices dissenting
it struck down the apportionment regulations as being
beyond statutory authorization.

While the Court was considering stock dividends in the
Koshland case, Congress was considering them in connection with the pending Revenue Act for 1936.
On March 3, 1936, the President had suggested the enactment of a tax upon the undistributed income of corporations.8 On March 26, 1936, and while the taxpayer's
petition for certiorari in the Koshland case was pending, a
Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee
recommended that such a tax be enacted in lieu of the
existing capital-stock, excess-profits, and income taxes on
corporations." It was thought by some authorities that
imposition directly upon shareholders of a tax based on
their pro rata shares of corporate earnings would be more
satisfactory than the undistributed-profits tax." Serious

the decision of the Supreme Court in 1920, it was no longer possible for
us to impose a tax upon the shareholder with respect to the undivided
profits of a domestic corporation. We were forced to adopt the system
of levying a special penalty tax on the corporation itself, which has
been exceedingly difficult to enforce in the courts and is nothing like as
effective as if we could ignore the corporation and tax the shareholder direct upon his undistributed earnings in the profits of the
corporation."

the way. Hearings on the Revenue Act, 1936, House Ways and Means
Committee, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 96, 97, 98. Congressman Lewis
stated: "I do not know that it is fully understood by the public that
this roundabout device of compelling the distribution of the real income of the corporation to its shareholders, so that the shareholders
may be called upon to pay taxes upon their income, is due to a decision
of a divided court. Some years ago the Supreme Court in a sharp
decision determined that we could not do in the United States with
regard to earned dividends that were not distributed what they do in
other countries, especially in England, require the shareholder to
pay his tax on his income just the same whether his company had
refused to distribute it or not.
"Now, if that decision of the Court should be reversed, what we are
doing here, or attempting to do in order to reach the taxpayer here,
the method of our attempt, would not be necessary. Not ours the
fault of all this clumsiness and indirection of approach to a necessary
public object." Id. at 193.

to a partnership, and then let the stockholder make his return?" that
"Unfortunately that was done about 60 years ago, and while it is my
recollection that the Supreme Court itself sustained the act, it later, by
another divided opinion, changed its mind and struck down the act as
being in contravention of the Constitution. So that it is impossible to
tax the undistributed profits which remain in the corporate Treasury as

The statements of members of Congress and of responsible Treasury officials at the hearings and debates on the
Act are at variance with the present assertion of the
Government that Congress intended § 115 (f) (1) to challenge or override the decision to which it had in other
sections of the Act accommodated itself.
At the hearings of the Congressional Committees the
proposed tax was attacked as being a measure which
would have the effect of forcing the distribution by corporations of assets needed in their business. Its supporters
anticipated the decision of this Court in the Koshland
case and countered with statements that dividends taxable as income to the shareholders-which would have
the effect of avoiding the undistributed-profits tax on the
corporation 1 3-could be declared and the undistributedprofits tax avoided without the necessity of distributing
assets.'

it would not have the money for the rainy day." Kent replied:

them has now reached the Supreme Court of the United Statesthat have taken the position that the constitutional immunity of the
true stock dividend recognized or declared in Eisner v. Macomber
does not apply to all types and varieties of so-called stock dividends;
for instance, that if the directors of a corporation instead of paying
a large cash dividend to the preferred shareholders of the corporation
see fit to give them common stock instead, that dividend of common
stock is taxable so far as the Constitution is concerned.
"I may say that in a case which is pending before the Supreme
Court there is a question also of the statutory interpretation, but
assuming, as I believe is a proper legal view of the case, that so far as
the Constitution is concerned, there are types of stock dividends that
may be taxed under the Constitution, that would provide a loophole.
Then, also, of course, there is the so-called optional stock dividend in
which the stockholder is given the option of taking cash or taking
stock. For any shareholder who wishes to maintain his proportionate
equity in the enterprise there is a very powerful incentive to take
stock." Congressman Vinson said: "Such option is property that has
a value and, in your opinion, takes that entirely out of the stock
dividend which was involved in the case of Eisner v. Macomber; is that
right?" Mr. Kent: "That is correct." Hearings on the Revenue Act,

As reported by the House Ways and Means Committee
and passed in the House, § 115 (f) (1) of the bill provided:
"A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders
in stock of the corporation or in rights to acquire stock of
the corporation shall be treated as a taxable dividend to
the extent that such distribution constitutes income to
the shareholder within the meaning of the Sixteenth
Amendment to the Constitution and represents a distribution of earnings or profits accumulated after February 28,

The manager of the Bill, Congressman Vinson of Kentucky, stated on the floor of the House, with reference to
§ 115 (f) (1): "In no sense is this an attack upon the
Eisner against Macomber decision. There are many
dividends received in stock and stock rights that are distinguishable from the character of stock dividend in the
Macomber case, supra, and are actual realized taxable
income. As we see it, a stock dividend that is not taxable
is one in which the relative interest of each shareholder of
a corporation is unchanged in his stock ownership." " He

Mr. Vinson. The case of Eisner against Macomber, as I recall, involved a corporation with $1,000,000 common stock. There was a
declaration of a $500,000 stock dividend to the common-share holders.
The Court held, and I think correctly, that where each shareholder got
his proportionate part of the new stock there was no change in his
ownership in the corporation. That, in a corporation with a milliondollar capital, the distribution of another half million to the holders
of the common stock made no change in ownership. The shareholder
who owned a share of stock would own one and a half shares in the
increased structure, and therefore there was no change in the ownership so far as he and the corporation were concerned.
It has been evidenced throughout the years that there are innumerable stock dividends that are taxable. The issuance of stock, either

The opinion of this Court in the Koshland case was announced on May 18, 1936, six days after the Senate Finance
common or preferred, or bonds, in payment of dividends may change
the proportion of ownership among the shareholders. For instance, let
us take this illustration: You issue preferred stockholders common
stock to satisfy dividends declared to preferred stockholders. You
have introduced additional common stock. It is in the hands of persons
other than the present common-stock holders; consequently there is
a change in the proportion of ownership in the common-stock
holders.
The Supreme Court in one case laid down the rule that the yardstick in respect of the taxability of stock dividends was the character
or kind of stock and the change in proportion of ownership. I submitted in the RECORD yesterday a statement prepared for me by Mr.
Kent, Acting General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue,
setting forth decisions of the Supreme Court where stock dividends
were held to be nontaxable; and other cases where the Supreme
Court and the Board of Tax Appeals held that stock dividends were
taxable. In this connection I pointed out that in the April volume
of the Columbia University Law Review a gentleman, in whom we
have great faith and confidence, the Honorable Roswell Magill, wrote
a very comprehensive and illuminating article on the taxability of
stock dividends.
Mr. Treadway....

As I recall it, in the present law there was just one line, 115, which
read "stock dividends shall not be subject to tax." That is correct?
Mr. Vinson. That is right.
Mr. Treadway. It has been stricken out in this bill, and you are
substituting therefor section (f), on page 107, of which the gentleman
has given a history.
Mr. Vinson. The section to which I refer states that the only stock
dividends we seek to tax are those which are taxable income within the
sixteenth amendment.
Mr. Treadway. The language stricken out, I may say, reads as
follows:
"(b) Stock dividends: A stock dividend shall not be subject to tax."
That is the existing law and has been the law most of the time since
the Eisner against Macomber decision. In the next tax bill after
that decision that language was included.
I understand the gentleman's explanation to be that the language of
the act was too broad. I do not mean too broad in the sense it is

Committee concluded its hearings. This Committee reported out § 115 (f) (1) in the form in which it is found
in the Act: "A distribution made by a corporation to its
shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock
shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does
not constitute income to the shareholder within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution." It
stated in explanation of the change: "This subsection of
the House bill, under which stock dividends are made taxable to the full extent permitted by the Constitution, is
retained by your committee, except for changes made
necessary by virtue of the reported amendment of section
115 (a) and in the interest of greater clarity." 2
Senators Black and La Follette of the Senate Finance
Committee submitted a minority report recommending an
increase in the undistributed-profits tax rates, and also
that § 115 (f) (1) specifically adopt the formula of the
recently decided Koshland case, for no apparent reason
other than a belief 'that in its present form it did not
clearly have the effect of taxing even the type of stock
dividends which the Court held in that case could be
taxed.
To this end they recommended that § 115 (f) (1) "Specifically provide that there shall be no undistributed-profnot legal, but it goes further than the Eisner against Macomber
decision.
Mr. Vinson. That is correct.
Mr. Treadway. The language now substituted for the stricken language describes new stock dividends that can be taxed or what portion
of stock dividends under the sixteenth amendment can in the future
be taxed. Is that the right conception of the intention?
Mr. Vinson. Well, we take the broad position that stock dividends
that are taxable income within the sixteenth amendment are subject
to taxation, and if they are not such stock dividends and not any
taxable income under the sixteenth amendment, they are not subject
to taxes. 80 Cong. Rec. 6309-6310.

its tax on stock dividends which are taxable income for the
individual recipient because the stock 'gives the stockholder an interest different from that which his former
stockholdings represented.' 22 In debate on the floor of
the Senate, Senator Black said that: "As all Senators know,
until about 2 weeks ago it was generally believed that it
was impossible to tax stock dividends as income of the recipient of those stock dividends. About 2 weeks ago, however, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered
an opinion which appeared in the Record, in which it
decided if those stock dividends were declared in a different type of stock than the stock which was originally held
by the owner, that those dividends did constitute actual
income-taxable income, if you please-in the hands of
the stockholder recipient.
"That being true, we have provided in such manner as
to avoid any possible misunderstanding, that stock dividends declared in such manner that they are taxable in
the hands of the recipient will be considered as distributed
profits against which no undistributed-profits tax is
imposed." 24
Senator Bone asked: "Would it not be possible for corporations to evade the effect of that kind of decision of
the Supreme Court by distributing stock of a character
that would escape taxation?" Senator Black answered

Rec. 8526-8529. Their Report stated that: "Under the opinion of
the Supreme Court in Koshland v. Helvering, decided May 18, 1936,

the Supreme Court decided that stock dividends represented taxable
income where they give 'the stockholder an interest different from
that which his former stockholdings represented.' It is, therefore, beyond any question of doubt, that under our proposal, corporations

would be able to retain all money profits needed for carrying on their
business without any additional corporate tax."

that they could, but that they would then be subject to
the undistributed-profits tax.25
In response to a question by Senator Adams whether it
would not be possible to tax stockholders in corporations
upon undistributed corporate earnings, as partnerships
were taxed upon undistributed partnership earnings, Senator Black stated that this was "impossible," 2 but that
"in order to achieve the same result we have suggested a
proposal which imposes no corporate tax on undistributed
profits if the corporation declares a stock dividend of such
nature as to be taxable under the recent Supreme Court
opinion. In that case, the case of Koshland against Helvering, the Court distinguished clearly and unequivocally
between a normal stock dividend of the same kind and
nature as the stock on which the dividend was declared
and a stock dividend of a distinctly different nature from
the stock on which the dividend was declared. In order
to carry out and obtain the full benefit of that, so that we
can permit every corporation, if it desires, to retain 100
cents of every dollar in its treasury, if its stockholders
wish, we have provided that there shall not be one dollar
of corporate undistributed profit tax imposed upon that
corporation if it distributes its dividends in a stock dividend which is taxable in the hands of the stockholders." 27
Senator La Follette said on the floor of the Senate that
"under all these measures-under the House bill, under
the Senate committee bill, and under this amendmentany corporation desiring to retain 100 percent of its statutory net income free from increased tax may do so by
paying out to its stockholders a dividend which is taxable

Senator Robinson stated his approval of the proffered
amendment, but suggested. that it be withdrawn and the
matter taken up in conference. The amendment was
accordingly withdrawn, but was not acted upon by the
conference29

The meaning of § 115 (f) (1) was critical in the administration both of the undistributed-profits tax upon corporations and of the income tax upon shareholders. This
was not its only importance, however. Like the earlier
Revenue Acts, the Revenue Act of 1936 contained provisions intended to cope with the problem of evasion of
income taxes by shareholders through failure to distribute
corporate income. ° These provisions had been drafted to
avoid the limitations set upon Congressional power by
Rec. 9052.
49 Stat. 1648, 1676, laid a graduated additional tax upon
the income of corporations other than personal holding companies as
defined in § 351, formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing
the imposition of the surtax upon their shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, through the medium of permitting
earnings or profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.
Sec. 351, 49 Stat. 1648, 1732, laid a graduated surtax upon income of
personal holding companies.
Under the Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916 and 1918, if a corporation was
availed of for the purpose of evading taxation by accumulation of
gains and profits the shareholders were taxed on their pro rata shares
of income, whether or not distributed. 38 Stat. 166; 39 Stat. 758;
40 Stat. 1072.
See. 220 of the Revenue Act of 1921 employed instead a tax against
the corporation. 42 Stat. 227, 247. H. R. Rep. No. 350, 67th Cong.,
1st Sess., pp. 12-13, stated in explanation of the change that: "Section
220 of the existing law provides that if any corporation is formed or
availed of for the purpose of evading the surtax upon its stockholders
through the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate
instead of being divided, the stockholders shall be taxed in the same
manner as partners. By reason of the recent decision of the Supreme

Eisner v. Macomber. It was generally believed that they
had failed, and ,would fail, fully to accomplish their purpose, and that fully effective provisions would entail a
challenge of the authority of Eisner v. Macomber21
In this state of affairs, the Treasury issued Regulations
which plainly construed § 115 (f) (1) not as repudiating
Eisner v. Macomber by taxing stock dividends but as
exempting them and adopting the existing decisions, including Eisner v. Macomber. Article 115-7 of Regulations 94, issued under the Revenue Act of 1936, set forth
references to the Court's decisions in many cases, and
said: "A stock dividend does not constitute income if the
new shares confer no different rights or interests than did
the old-the new certificates plus the old representing
considerable doubt exists as to the constitutionality of the xisting law."

Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 702, 751.
The 1926 and subsequent Acts permitted the avoidance of tax on
the corporation by inclusion of undistributed corporate income in the
gross income of its shareholders.
"IThus, Senator Black said on the floor of the Senate that "It is a
vain and an illusory hope to anticipate that the Government of the
United States will ever be able to prevent tax avoidance on the part
of corporate officials by the simple expedient of charging and proving
against them that they have withheld a distribution of profits to avoid
taxes." 80 Cong. Rec. 8811. See also statement by Oliphant, General

the same proportionate interest in the net assets of the
corporation as did the old." Three examples followed,
the second relating to a dividend identical with the one
before us. The example concluded: "The stock so distributed does not constitute a taxable stock dividend to
the shareholders." The Treasury also issued a statement of general policy as to stock dividends, to the effect
that it would allow a dividends-paid credit against the
undistributed-profits tax with respect to stock dividends
which were clearly taxable to stockholders and refuse such
credit with respect to stock dividends which were "clearly
nontaxable to the shareholder"; and where taxability was
a debatable question, it would tentatively allow a dividends-paid credit if the corporation claiming the credit
should file. proper waivers or agreements to protect the
interests of the Government pending final determination
of the taxability to shareholders of the distribution, either
by closing agreement executed by all shareholders or by
a final adjudication in court."2
Administration of § 115 (f) (1) was undertaken and
continued upon the basis of this construction, and no
effort was made to obtain a different one. On the contrary, the Government in this Court took the position
that the meaning of § 115 (f) (1) was correctly stated by
Congressman Vinson on the floor of the House as quoted
infra, p. 380.'s
Other agencies of the Government accepted this same
view of the meaning of the statute, authorizing the issuance by corporations subject to their supervision of
securities other than common stock, at variance with their
usual policy and in order to permit the corporations to

do what the Treasury assured them was necessary to avoid
the payment of undistributed-profits taxes.5"
The undistributed-profits tax evoked a voluminous literature, which showed almost universal agreement with
the correctness of the Treasury's contemporaneous statement of the meaning of the statute. 5
We think if Congress had passed or intended to pass an
Act challenging a well known constitutional decision of
this Court there would appear at least one clear statement
of that purpose either from its proponents or its adversaries. Not one contemporaneous word in or out of Congress discloses the purpose which the Government says
we should find that this legislation accomplished.
Against this background, it was proposed to incorporate
an undistributed-profits tax in the pending Revenue Act
for 1938. As proposed and enacted, § 115 (f) (1) was the
same as in the 1936 Act. 6 Like earlier Acts, the Revenue
Act of 1938, as proposed and enacted, contained provisions

" § 102, 52 Stat. 447, 483; § 401, 52 Stat. 447, 557 (similar to § 351
of the Revenue Act of 1936). The Revenue Act of 1938, as proposed
and enacted, contained a "consent dividends" provision allowing shareholders to permit the corporation to avoid the undistributed-profits
tax by consenting to include in their returns amounts as though actual
distributions had been made in cash. § 28, 52 Stat. 447, 470-472. See

The following colloquy between Alvord, representing the Committee
of Federal Finance, Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and
Congressman Lewis, took place at the House Hearings. Hearings on
the Revenue Act, 1938, House Ways and Means Committee, pp. 505506:
Mr. Lewis. Do you realize that these extra taxes on the corporations
as such, including the personal holding company and the others, are
due to the decision in Eisnerv. Macomber?
Mr. Alvord. Yes.
Mr. Lewis. I am just asking that by way of preface.
Mr. Alvord. Yes, sir. I discussed that quite at length, I think, back
in 1936.
Mr. Lewis. Unhappily, it is not being discussed at the present time
in the press as fully as it should be in order that the procedure of the
committee be fairly understood. You will recall, of course, that under
that decision, a 5-to-4 decision, it was held that, notwithstanding the
general terms of the income-tax amendment, that tax on paid-up stock
dividends was unconstitutional.
Now, before I go any further, I want to say that certainly so far as
I am concerned there would be no support for any of these extra
taxes if that decision were reversed and the earned income of shareholders in corporations were left subject to taxation, just as the earned
income of partners is subject to tax, although that income may be
plowed into the partnership business.
Mr. Alvord. I think if you will read my testimony back in 1936
you will find that I agree with you absolutely in principle. But bear
in mind that we have some very practical problems in addition to
consider.
Mr. Lewis. Very well.

of forcing the distribution of needed corporate assets.
The rate of the undistributed-profits tax was, however,
Mr. Alvord. Because I do not think you can afford to exempt the
corporation entirely for example, which the following of that decision
would require.
Mr. Lewis. Now, of course, the general public wants to be fair in
this matter, and even your clients realize that the Government of the
United States must in some way secure revenues. I am a little curious
to know why voices as influential as yours, or especially as the voice
of your clients-I read all their reports, profit by them, I am glad to
say-have never been raised asking a reversal of that decision so that
we can go back and tax shareholders normally as we do other individuals and partners.
All this trouble we are discussing today will disappear in a moment
if that result is obtained.
Mr. Alvord. I think, Mr. Lewis, I can explain to you fully why
that has not been done up to the present time. If I recall correctly,
Eisner v. Macomber was decided in the late spring of 1921, just while
the 1921 act was under consideration, just before it passed; whereupon
a specific provision was written into the statute, saying that stock
dividends escape taxes; and that provision has stayed in the statute.
Mr. Lewis. Yes.
Mr. Alvord. It has been whittled down, it is true.
Mr. Lewis. Yes. But the decision also carries a provision against
taxing even undistributed income to the shareholder.
Mr. Alvord. No; I do not think that is true, Mr. Lewis.
Mr. Lewis. Well, that is the view of others, and that is the view of
the committee. If you will provide me a way by which the shareholder in the corporation can be required to pay his taxes like individuals and partners on earned income, I will promise you my support
in an effort to repeal all these extra tax provisions.
Mr. Alvord. Well, I think your position is almost unassailable in
that respect, Mr. Lewis.
Mr. Lewis. Very well.
Mr. Alvord. It is a position that many of us have taken for a long
time.
Mr. Lewis. But will you hear this question in the spirit it is put:
Do you not think the Government under such circumstances is under
a duty to try in some way to recoup itself for these lost taxes in the
shareholder group who would be subject to them? If we are, isn't it
natural that we should go to the corporation that is shielding them, in

very materially lower than in the 1936 Act. 8 This would
have had the effect of diminishing the amount which
would be collected from the corporation as undistributedprofits tax despite the declaration of a nontaxable stock
dividend. Despite these factors, again there was not the
slightest suggestion of the view that § 115 (f) (1) had
made or had intended to make all stock dividends taxable;
on the contrary, there was continued recognition of the
most cases, of course, unintentionally, but still go to the corporation
and say: "Now please distribute those dividends so that we can get
at this shareholder who is dodging his burden under Eisner v. Macomber"? Isn't that all very natural, sir?
Title II of the Revenue Act of 1937 amended the Revenue Act of
1936 by adding § 334, which provided for the inclusion in the gross
income of shareholders in foreign personal holding companies the undistributed corporate income. The abuses incident to the employment
of this device had been brought out at Hearings before a Joint Committee on Tax Evasion and Avoidance, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. The
Committee Reports on the Bill cite the practical necessity for this form
of tax in support of its constitutionality. H. R. Rep. No. 1546, 75th
Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 13-14; S. Rep. No. 1242, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.,

statement of Congressman Vinson on the floor of the House, 81 Cong.
Rec. 9035: "The philosophy in regard to foreign personal holding
companies is based upon the inherent power in the Government to protect itself from devices to avoid and evade its law. The Supreme
Court has said that the Congress has the power to regulate interstate
rates, and that it can regulate intrastate rates when such exercise of
power is to protect the plenary power over interstate rates. We feel
certain that the jurisdiction over American taxpayers and income to our
citizens, together with the power to protect our revenues are ample legal
support for our position." See also, statement of Congressman Treadway, 81 Cong. Rec. 9024.

was reenacted while the Treasury Regulation and rulings
on its meaning stood unamended and in their original
form.'
The Treasury adhered to its earlier views of the meaning of § 115 (f) (1) by repromulgating its former Regulation under the Revenue Act of 1938 and under the Internal
Revenue Code,' and it stood unamended at the time of the
receipt of the stock dividends here in question. Congress
in 1939 enacted basis provisions incorporating the language of § 115 (f)(1).4 It was not until November 15,
1940, and after the receipt of the dividends here involved,
that the Treasury amended the Regulation, and then
only by striking out all after the first sentence. 8 This
action followed the decision of this Court in Helvering v.
Bruun, 309 U. S. 461, on March 25, 1940, which rejected
the concept that taxable gain could arise only when the
taxpayer was able to sever increment from his original
capital. It preceded by ten days the decision in Helvering
v. Horst, 311 U. S. 112, which held that there was no exemption from taxation where economic gain is enjoyed
"by some event other than the taxpayer's personal receipt
of money or property." Id. at 116. Each of these deci39

sions undermined further the original theoretical bases
of the decision in Eisner v. Macomber.
The Government says that the time has come when
Eisnerv. Macomber must be overruled, and that we should
construe § 115 (f) (1) as intended to tax the dividends here
in question and thus to require reconsideration of that
decision. It should be observed that the question of the
constitutional validity of Eisner v. Macomber is plainly
one of the first magnitude, but this is not to say that it
is presented in this case. Under our judicial tradition we
do not decide whether a tax may constitutionally be laid
until we find that Congress has laid it. Unless the tax
asserted by the Commissioner has been authorized by Congress, it fails of validity before we even reach the constitutional question. To reach that question we must decide
whether Congress intended by § 115 (f) (1) to do what
Eisner v. Macomber squarely held that it could not. We
cannot find that it did.
The Government cannot sustain its position on a literal
reading of § 115 (f) (1). Unlike the Revenue Act of
1916,44 it does not state that all'stock dividends are taxable. Instead, § 115 (f) (1) qualifies the generality of
§ 22 (a) by providing that a distribution made in shares
of the corporation's stock "shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does not constitute income to
the shareholder within the meaning of the Sixteenth
Amendment. . .... (Italics supplied.) If the statute is
to be literally read, use of "does" instead of some word of
futurity indicates that the time of enactment or at the
latest the time of receipt of the dividend is the critical one
for determining taxability. Under either view these dividends would not be taxable. The parties are agreed that
for the purposes of this decision the meaning of the Constitution must be found in the decisions of this Court,

and when these dividends were received Eisner v. Macomber fixed the meaning contrary to the Government's
position.
The administrative and legislative history of the statute
squarely conflict with the Government's position in this
case.
The Treasury Regulation issued under § 115 (f) (1)
immediately after it was first enacted states in terms that
the statute was not intended to lay a tax on the facts of
this case and of Eisner v. Macomber, and the Treasury advised taxpayers by another ruling that some stock dividends were "clearly" nontaxable. In White v. Winchester
Club, 315 U. S. 32, 41, we said that such "substantially
contemporaneous expressions of opinion, are highly relevant and material evidence of the probable general understanding of the times and of the opinions of men who
probably were active in the drafting of the statute." "
The statute was reenacted in its original form after having
been in force for two years, and after a long controversy
centering around the meaning of the statute which assumed throughout the correctness of the administrative
construction. This Courthas denied retroactive effects
to amendments to valid Treasury Regulations which have
survived reenactment of the statute, even in the absence
of any affirmative indication that the subject-matter of
the statute and Regulation was called to the attention of
Congress." The effect of reenactment in the absence of

47 Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, 83: "Treasury regulations and
interpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to
unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have
received congressional approval and have the effect of law." In Helvering v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 306 U. S. 110, 116, it was said
that: "Since the legislative approval of existing regulations by reenactment of the statutory provision to which they appertain gives such
regulations the force of law, we think that Congress did not intend to
authorize the Treasury to repeal the rule of law that existed during
the period for which the tax is imposed," and the question of the
validity of prospective amendment was left open. In Helvering v.
Wilshire Oil Co., 308 U. S. 90, the Court carefully examined the taxpayer's position for equities and found it wanting; and after citing the
Reynolds Tobacco case with approval, stated with reference to the
view that reenactment of a statute carried legislative approval of its
existing valid administrative construction, that: "It does not mean that
a regulation interpreting a provision of one act becomes frozen into
another act merely by reenactment of that provision, so that that administrative interpretation cannot be changed prospectively through
exercise of appropriate rule-making powers." Id. at 100: Helvering v.
Reynolds, 313 U. S. 428, qualified the Reynolds Tobacco case and distinguished it on the grounds that "The transactions there in question
took place at a time when a regulation was in force which expressly
negatived any tax liability. The regulation remained outstanding for
a long time and was followed by several reenactments of the statute.
About five years after the transactions in question took place, the prior
regulation was amended so as to impose a tax liability. There are no
such circumstances here." Id. at 432-433.

agreement with the Treasury on the question of the taxability of the stock dividends here involved. We would
think it unquestionable that in this case the Treasury
could not retroactively amend the Regulation to the prejudice of the respondent, except for the Government's assertion that it should be disregarded upon the authority of
Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 121, note 8, and that,
in any event, under § 3791 (b) of the Internal Revenue
Code the Secretary or Commissioner must be held to have
authority in any case to make a retroactive amendment
of a Regulation.
The Hallock case is clearly inapposite. There it was
held that Treasury Regulations issued more than 11 years
after the enactment of the governing Revenue Act of
1926,4" in submission to the decision of this Court in 1935
of the St. Louis Trust Co. cases, 296 U. S. 39, 48, could not
prevent the Court from overruling those cases on facts
entirely antedating them. That Regulation did not purport to construe the meaning of the statute, as did this one,
but simply to acknowledge a constitutional limit imposed
by this Court upon the operation of a previously enacted
statute; it was not in effect when the transactions involved
were entered upon; and there had been no reenactment of
the statute while the Regulation was in force.
Nor do we concur in the Government's argument that
the legislative history of § 3791 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code requires reconsideration of our decision as to the
effect of a corresponding provision of the Revenue Act of
1928 in Helveringv. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 306 U. S.

Act of 1926. It is the final statute of a series intended to relieve the
Treasury from the effect of the view that its administrative rulings,
like court decisions, must have retroactive as well as prospective
operation.
During and after the first World War the Treasury had been burdened with a great volume of tax business. Perfect consistency in
rulings was impossible, and the view that each change in administrative
construction must be given retroactive effect deprived both the Government and the taxpayers of any assurance that cases once settled
would stay settled. See statement by Dr. Adams, Tax Adviser to
the Treasury, Hearings, Revenue Revision, House Ways and Means
Committee, 67th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 38-40; H. R. Rep. No. 1035, 66th
Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.
To remedy this situation Congress provided in § 1314 of the Revenue
Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 314, that: "in case a regulation or Treasury
decision" should be reversed by a subsequent "regulation or Treasury
decision, and such reversal is not immediately occasioned or required
by a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction," the subsequent
regulation or decision might be applied without retroactive effect.
This provision was carried into the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926.
43 Stat. 253, 340; 44 Stat. 9, 114. The 1928 Act expanded it to include
cases where the new Regulation or Treasury decision was occasioned or
required by a court decision. 45 Stat. 791, 874; S. Rep. No. 960, 70th
Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40. The Conference Committee stated that: "It
is hoped that this provision will prevent the constant reopening of
cases on account of changes in regulations or Treasury decisions, and it
is believed that sound administration properly places upon the Government the responsibility and burden of interpreting the law and of
prescribing regulations upon which the taxpayers may rely." H. R.

The Committee Reports state that § 506 of the Revenue Act of 1934,

the Treasury to avoid inequities to persons who had closed transactions in reliance upon "existing practice," and that the "amendment

Opinion of the Court.

We would be reluctant, in 'any event, to find that Congress intended to hold the effect of § 115 (f) (1) in abeyance until the Treasury should decide that the time was
ripe to challenge Eisner v. Macomber and carry its challenge to this Court. Such an intention would be a serious
departure from the usual policy of Congress to provide the
taxpayers and tax-gatherers with a practical basis for the
timely settlement of questions of taxation arising each
year. At the times of enactment, the problem of delay
in obtaining decisions of this Court was a matter of grave
concern to those concerned with the administration and
furnishing of the revenues.6
The Government's assertion that Congress intended to
hold the meaning of § 115 (f) (1) in suspense until the
termination of years of litigation is in conflict with our
recent decision in Parker v. Motor Boat Sales Co., 314
U. S. 244. There we were called upon to construe § 3 (a)
of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, 44 Stat.
1424, which made compensation payable only if "recovery
for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State
law.") Its statement in such terms was due to this Court's
decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205,
a much criticized and somewhat impaired, but not overprescribe the exact extent to which any regulation or Treasury Decision,
whether or not it amends a priorregulation or Treasury Decision, will
be applied without retroactive effect. The amendment furthermore
permits internal revenue rulings as well as regulations or Treasury
Decisions to be applied without retroactive effect." (Italics supplied.)

from the retroactive effects of administrative action by the Treasury,
rather than to increase its power to make retroactive rulings. Cf. 69

state compensation laws forbidden in an area of "shadowy
limits." The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Black,
said, "An interpretation which would enlarge or contract

the effect of the proviso in accordance with whether this
Court rejected or reaffirmed the constitutional basis of the
Jensen and its companion cases cannot be acceptable.
The result of such an interpretation would be to subject
the scope of protection that Congress wished to provide,
to uncertainties that Congress wished to avoid." Id. at

The Government urges that we read into the Congres-

sional Act an intent to tax these dividends because of
considerations that we do not think are entitled to any
weight. It argues that the form of § 115 (f) (1) is attributable to "embarrassment" which would have been
incident to a "frontal attack" on Eisner v. Macomber.
There is ample ground to know that the prospect of conflict in opinion with this Court on constitutional questions was not sufficient so to mute the 74th and 75th
Congresses." This was as it should be. There is no
reason to doubt that this Court may fall into error as
may other branches of the Government. Nothing in the

And, if we were to assume Congressional "embarrassment" and take it into consideration, we would also be
required to weigh the many other political factors which

most that was politically possible; those who opposed it
may have thought it desirable as matter of tax policy to
defer taxation of the stock dividend until realization."
Needless to say, speculation upon such factors has no
place in the construction of Acts of Congress.
We are asked to make a retroactive holding that for
some seven years past a multitude of transactions have
been taxable although there was no source of law from
which the most cautious taxpayer could have learned of
the liability. If he consulted the decisions of this Court,
he learned that no such tax could be imposed; if he read
the Delphic language of the Act in connection with existing decisions, it, too, assured him there was no intent to
tax; if he followed the Congressional proceedings and
debates, his understanding of nontaxability would be confirmed; if he asked the tax collector himself, he was
bound by the Regulations of the Treasury to advise that
no such liability existed. It would be a pity if taxpayers
could not rely on this concurrent assurance from all three
branches of the Government. But we are asked to brush
all this aside and simply to decree that these transactions
are taxable anyway.
54 The considerations which underlay the decisions in Towne v.
Eisner and Eisner v. Macomber may have had their influence in the
judgment of Congress itself. Compare the question put by Senator
Bone to Senator Black, set forth supra, p. 384. Before the decision
in Eisner v. Macomber, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
had held that stock dividends could be taxed, Tax Commissioner v.
Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 116 N. E. 904 (1917); but the Massachusetts
legislature had also specifically exempted them from income taxation.

Mass. Stat. 1920, c. 352, now G. L. c. 62 § 1 (b). After the decision
of Eisner v. Macomber, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected its
reasoning in State ex rel. Dulaney v. Nygaard, 174 Wis. 597, 183 N. W.
884 (1921), but since 1927 stock dividends have been exempted from
income taxation. Wis. Stat. § 71.02. In 1926, the New York legislature adopted a provision retroactive to January 1, 1919, the effective
date of the first state income-tax law, exempting all stock dividends.

371

Opinion of the Court.

Nor is the effect on taxpayers the only consequence of
accepting such a proposal. It would unsettle tax administration and subject the Treasury itself to many demands
in ways that we cannot anticipate and provide for. Many
have sold dividend stocks and paid the postponed tax at
higher rates than if they had been taxed as is now proposed. Many have paid on the sale of the original stock
because of allocation of part of the dividend to reduce the
cost base thereof. Many corporations have been refused
deductions on account of this type of stock dividend in
computing their undistributed corporate earnings tax,
which would become entitled to them. Overhanging the
whole effort to accommodate these past transactions to a
new retroactive law would be the statute of limitations
barring sometimes the Government and sometimes the
taxpayer with capricious effects. To rip out of the past
seven years of tax administration a principle of law on
which both Government and taxpayers have acted would
produce readjustments and litigation so extensive we
would contemplate them with anxiety. We have recently
held as to another questioned decision of this Court that a
long period of accommodations to an older decision sometimes requires us to adhere to an unsatisfactory rule to
avoid unfortunate practical results from a change. Davis
v. Department of Labor, 317 U. S. 249. We think this
another example of the same principle.
The Government acknowledges the hardship which
would be incident to the rule we axe now asked to declare,
and promises its assistance in obtaining legislative correction. It says that: "We are informed by the Treasury
that it has no intention of harassing taxpayers with respect to liability for past years, and that if Eisner v. Macomber is overruled it intends immediately to recommend
to Congress legislation which would relieve taxpayers of
any unfair retroactive burden that might result from
such overruling .

Of course, if there were an adequate basis in statute and
regulation for the tax in question, it is difficult to understand why its collection should be regarded as "harassing." This assurance that if we will but find that Congress has intended to lay the tax it will be asked to declare
that it does not intend it to be collected is hardly reassuring that the decision contended for would be what
Congress intended. Since it is acknowledged that legislation would be required to adjust equities that are beyond judicial power and to prevent our decision's being
used to harass taxpayers, we may well inquire why the
legislation should not precede the judicial decision. Why
should we be asked to impose by interpretation a tax
which the Treasury intends to ask Congress to lift?
We are unable to find that Congress intended to tax
the dividends in question, and without Congressional
authority we are powerless to do so. That being the case,
we cannot reach the reconsideration of Eisner v. Macomber on the basis of the present legislation and Regulations.

provision is now rewritten so as to permit stock dividends
to be taxable when they constitute "income to the shareholder within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to
the Constitution as construed by Eisner v. Macomber."
That extraordinary result is reached in the face of the
plain language of the Act and in face of clear statements
of its purpose made in Committee Reports. The report
of the House Ways and Means Committee (H. Rep. No.
2475, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10) stated that stock dividends were to be taxable when they constituted "income
to the shareholder within the meaning of the sixteenth
amendment to the Constitution." The report of the Senate Finance Committee (S. Rep. No. 2156, 74th Cong., 2d
Sess., p. 18) contained the unequivocal statement that
"stock dividends are made taxable to the full extent per°mitted by the Constitution." That purpose is now
thwarted. Reliance is placed on certain statements made
by Mr. Vinson who managed the bill on the floor of the
House. Yet the most that can be said is that his statements in explanation of the bill were ambiguous. He
stated, to be sure, that the new provision was not to be
poration to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property,
(1) out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913,
or (2) out of the earnings or profits of the taxable year (computed as
of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any

distributions made during the taxable year), without regard to the
amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was
made."
Sec. 115 (f) (1) is entitled "General Rule" and reads as follows: "A
distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders in its stock or
in rights to acquire its stock shall not be treated as a dividend to the
extent that it does not constitute income to the shareholder within the
meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution."
Sec. 115 (j) sets forth the formula for valuation of dividends other
than cash dividends: "If the whole or any part of a dividend is paid to
a shareholder in any medium other than money the property received
other than money shall be included in gross income at its fair market
value at the time as of which it becomes income to the shareholder."

regarded as "an attack upon the Eisner against Macomber
decision." 80 Cong. Rec., Pt. 6, p. 6215. But in answer to
an inquiry from Mr. Treadway whether the new provision
"describes new stock dividends that can be taxed or what
portion of stock dividends under the sixteenth amendment can in the future be taxed," he made the following
statement: "Well, we take the broad position that stock
dividends that are taxable income within the sixteenth
amendment are subject to taxation, and if they are not
such stock dividends and not any taxable income under
the sixteenth amendment, they are not subject to taxes."
Id., p. 6310. I fail to see in that declaration even any intimation that Eisner v. Macomber rather than the Constitution marked the reach of the new legislation. Furthermore, a reading of the whole discussion on the floor of
the House indicates to me that his denial that the legislation made an "attack" on Eisner v. Macomber fell far
short of suggesting that the House intended to foreclose
this Court from rexamining Eisner v. Macomber. If
Congress had that purpose, the Act hardly would have
been phrased in terms which embrace the full scope of the
Sixteenth Amendment. To me, the disavowal of an intent
to "attack" Eisner v. Macomber meant no more than a
disclaimer of any purpose to propose unconstitutional legislation. Eisner v. Macomber is a decision of this Court.
Under the traditional conceptions of the place of judicial
review in our constitutional system, this Court and only
this Court can change the rule of that case in absence of
an amendment to the Constitution. Congress here was
merely respecting that traditional view. It wanted to go
as far as it could. But it could have no idea how far that
would be until this Court spoke. No one could predict
whether this Court would overrule, modify, or sustain
Eisnerv. Macomber when the 1936 legislation came before

it. Indeed, when the 1936 bill passed the House,' Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441, which narrowed the application of Eisner v. Macomber, had not been decided by
this Court. And Helveringv. Gowran,302 U. S. 238, which
somewhat extended the rule of the Koshland case was not
decided until after the 1936 Act was passed. But numerous decisions by lower courts had made inroads on the
Eisnerv. Macomber doctrine. The rule of that case was in
flux; a process of erosion had set in; and none knew where
that erosion would cease. Accordingly, Congress drafted
§ 115 (f) of the 1936 Act in the most flexible of terms. It
used sweeping language incorporating the full coverage of
the Sixteenth Amendment so that those stock dividends
would be taxed which this Court would permit to be taxed.
There are probably other ways in which the same idea
could have been phrased. But the one chosen is clear
enough.
The only Treasury Regulations applicable to the taxable year in question-1939-are Regulations 103. These
were originally promulgated on January 29, 1940. Sec.
19.115-7 provided: "A distribution made by a corporation
to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its
stock shall be treated as a dividend to the full extent that
it constitutes income to the shareholders within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution."
That sentence was followed by the statement, "The Supreme Court has pointed out some of the characteristics
distinguishing a stock dividend which constitutes income
from one which does not constitute income within the
meaning of the Constitution." Then followed a summary of our decisions, ending with three examples based
on the Koshland case, Eisner v. Macomber, and the Gow2April

ran case. On November 15, 1940, this regulation was
amended by striking out everything following the first sentence. This regulation, however, even in its original
form did not and could not foreclose inquiry into the
validity of the decision in Eisner v. Macomber. It did no
more than state the constitutional principles on which the
decided cases rested. It certainly did not indicate that
the Treasury construed the statute more narrowly than the
Constitution itself. However that may be, this Court on
more than one occasion has refused to follow a Treasury
regulation which it felt to be "in the teeth" of the statute.
Helvering v. Sabine TransportationCo., ante, p. 306; Helvering v. Credit Alliance Corp., 316 U. S. 107. If this
*regulation be construed to narrow the Act so as to tax only
stock dividends permitted by Eisner v. Macomber, I
would have less reluctance in striking it down than I have
had in other instances.
But there is said to be lack of wisdom in this interpretation of the Act. It is argued that it would be disruptive
.of tax administration. It is urged that a decision which
now overruled Eisner v. Macomber would be unfair because it would be retroactive. Those matters are none
of our business. Every revenue act which Congress has
passed has a retroactive effect. It is something on which
taxpayers of necessity take their chances. Milliken v.
United States, 283 U. S. 15, 23. And many of the uncertainties in revenue acts necessarily are not resolved
until this Court passes on them years later. Here there
is no possible basis for complaint. These stock dividends
were declared in 1939, three years after the Act making
them taxable was passed. Of course, the taxpayer no
more than Congress could predict what interpretation
this Court would give the new statute. Sec. 115 (f) (1),
however, made the risks apparent. The fact that some
guessed wrong is wholly irrelevant to this litigation. Inequities may result from a holding in 1943 that Eisner v.

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

Macomber has not been the law since 1936. But the relief against them lies with Congress. Our task ends if
we erase Eisner v. Macomber and give Congress a clean
slate on which to write. Then and only then can Congress design a tax system treating stock dividends consistently. So long as Congress has to guess whether or not
this Court will overrule Eisner v. Macomber, any interim
treatment which it gives stock dividends may have to be
readjusted after this Court speaks, so as to remove inequities which may have resulted.
II.
I think Eisner v. Macomber should be overruled. The
Sixteenth Amendment gives Congress the power "to lay
and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived." As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his dissent in
Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S., p. 237, that Amendment
was designed to include "everything which by reasonable
understanding can fairly be regarded as income." Stock
dividends representing profits certainly are income in the
popular sense. "From a practical common-sense point
of view there is something strange in the idea that a man
may indefinitely grow richer without ever being subject
to an income tax." Powell, Income From CorporateDividends, 35 Harv. L. Rev. 363, 376. The wealth of stockholders normally increases as a result of the earnings of
the corporation in which they hold shares. I see no
reason why Congress could not treat that increase in
wealth as "income" to them. See Collector v. Hubbard,
Cf. the income tax of partners. See. 182 of the Internal Revenue
Code provides: "In computing the net income of each partner, he
shall include, whether or not distribution is made to him . . . (c) His
distributive share of the ordinary net income or the ordinary net loss
of the partnership, computed as provided in section 183 (b)." A
partner is chargeable with his allocable share of the partnership earnings even where they could not be distributed to him by reason of

U. S. 282, 288; Powell, The Stock-Dividend Decision and
The CorporateNonentity, 5 Nat. Tax Assoc. Bull. 201.
The notion that there can be no "income" to the shareholders in such a case within the meaning of the Sixteenth
Amendment unless the gain is "severed from" capital and
made available to the recipient for his "separate use,
benefit and disposal" (Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S., pp.
207, 211) will not stand analysis. In cases like Koshland
v. Helvering and Helvering v. Gowran where stock dividends were held to be taxable as income, both the original
investment and the accumulations were retained by the
company. Yet those cases hold that stockholders may
receive "income" from the operations of their corporation
though the corporation makes no distribution of assets
to them. And see United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156;
Rockefeller v. United States, 257 U. S. 176; Cullinan v.
Walker, 262 U. S. 134; Marrv. United States, 268 U. S. 536.
Other cases make plain that there may be "income" though
neither money nor property has been received by the taxpayer. Benefits accruing as the result of the discharge
local law. Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U. S. 271, 281: "The tax is thus
imposed upon the partner's proportionate share of the net income of
the partnership, and the fact that it may not be currently distributable,
whether by agreement of the parties or by operation of law, is not
material." As stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissent in Eisner
v. Macomber, 252 U. S., p. 231: "The stockholder's interest in the
property of the corporation differs, not fundamentally but in form
only, from the interest of a partner in the property of the firm. There
is much authority for the proposition that, under our law, a partnership
or joint stock company is just as distinct and palpable an entity in the
idea of the law, as distinguished from the individuals composing it,
as is a corporation. No reason appears why Congress, in legislating
under a grant of power so comprehensive as that authorizing the levy
of an income tax, should be limited by the particular view of the relation of the stockholder to the corporation and its property which may,
in the absence of legislation, have been taken by this court."

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

of the taxpayer's indebtedness or obligations constitute
familiar examples. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U. S. 716; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1;
United States v. Hendler, 303 U. S. 564. And increases
in the value of property as a result of improvements made
by the lessee are taxable income to the lessor even though
the taxpayer could not "sever the improvement begetting
the gain from his original capital." Helvering v. Bruun,
309 U. S. 461, 469. The declaration of a stock dividend
normally will not increase the wealth of the stockholders.
Its accrual will usually antedate that event. See Haig
et al., The Federal Income Tax (1921) p. 8. For it is the
accumulation of corporate earnings over a period of time
which marks any- real accrual of wealth to the stockholders. The narrow question here is whether Congress
has the power to make the receipt of a stock dividend based
on earnings an occasion for recognizing that accrual of
wealth for income tax purposes. Congress has done so
through the formula of computing the "income" to the
stockholders at the "fair market value" of the stock dividends received. § 115 (j). Whether that is the most
appropriate procedure which could be selected for the
purpose may be arguable. But I can see no constitutional
reason for saying that Congress cannot make that choice
if it so desires. That is one way-though perhaps at times
a crude one-of measuring for income tax purposes the
wealth which normally accrues to stockholders as a result
of the earning of their corporation.
