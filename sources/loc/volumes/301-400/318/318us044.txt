TILESTON v. ULLMAN.
Opinion of the Court.

PER CURIAM.

This case comes here on appeal to review a declaratory
judgment of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut
that §§ 6246 and 6562 of the General Statutes of Connecticut of 1930-prohibiting the use of drugs or instruments
to prevent conception, and the giving of assistance or
counsel in their use-are applicable to appellant, a registered physician, and as applied to him are constitutional.
129 Conn. 84, 26 A. .2d 582, 588.
The suit was tried and judgment rendered on the allegations of the complaint which are stipulated to be true.
Appellant alleged that the statute, if applicable to him,
would prevent his giving professional advice concerning
the use of contraceptives to three patients whose condition
of health was such that their lives would be endangered
by child-bearing, and that appellees, law enforcement
officers of the state, intend to prosecute any offense against
the statute and "claim or may claim" that the proposed
professional advice would constitute such an offense. The
complaint set out in detail the danger to the lives of
appellant's patients in the event that they should bear
children, but contained no allegations asserting any claim
under the Fourteenth Amendment of infringement of appellant's liberty or his property rights. The relief prayed
was a declaratory judgment as to whether the statutes are
applicable to appellant and if so whether they constitute
a valid exercise of constitutional power "within the meaning and intent of Amendment XIV of the Constitution
of the United States prohibiting a state from depriving
any person of life without due process of law." On stipulation of the parties the state superior court ordered these
questions of law reserved for the consideration and advice
of the Supreme Court of Errors. That court, which assumed without deciding that the case was an appropriate
one for a declaratory judgment, ruled that the statutes

"prohibit the action proposed to be done" by appellant
and "are constitutional."
We are of the opinion that the proceedings in the state
courts present no constitutional question which appellant
has standing to assert. The sole constitutional attack
upon the statutes under the Fourteenth Amendment is
confined to their deprivation of life-obviously not appellant's but his patients'. There is no allegation or proof
that appellant's life is in danger. His patients are not
parties to this proceeding and there is no basis on which
we can say that he has standing to secure an adjudication
of his patients' constitutional right to life, which they do
not assert in their own behalf. Cronin v. Adams, 192
U. S. 108, 114; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, 225
U. S. 540, 550; Bosley v. McLaughlin, 236 U. S. 385, 395;
Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273; The Winnebago, 205
U. S. 354, 360; Davis & Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles,
189 U. S. 207, 220. No question is raised in the record
with respect to the deprivation of appellant's liberty or
property in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment,
nor is there anything in the opinion or judgment of the
Supreme Court of Errors which indicates or would support
a decision of any question other than those raised in the
superior court and reserved by it for decision of the Supreme Court of Errors. That court's practice is to decline
to answer questions not reserved. General Statutes
§ 5652; Loomis Institute v. Healy, 98 Conn. 102, 129,
119 A. 31; John J. McCarthy Co. v. Alsop, 122 Conn. 288,
298-99, 189 A. 464.
Since the appeal must be dismissed on the ground that
appellant has no standing to litigate the constitutional
question which the record presents, it is unnecessary to
consider whether the record shows the existence of a genuine case or controversy essential to the exercise of the
jurisdiction of this Court. Cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry.
Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 259.
Dismissed.
