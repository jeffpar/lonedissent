CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 7. Argued October 13, 14, 1942.-Decided March 15, 1943.
1. Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, providing for the reorganization
of railroads engaged in interstate commerce, construed with respect
to the functions of the District Court and the Interstate Commerce
Commission. P. 466.
2. In respect of a plan of reorganization for the Western Pacific
Railroad Company, certified to it by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the District Court functioned in accordance with the
requirements of § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. P. 475.
3. In a railroad reorganization proceeding under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Interstate Commerce Commission's determination
of value, supported by evidence and in accordance with legal standards, is not subject to reexamination by the court. P. 472.
4. The determination of whether a plan of reorganization under § 77
is "compatible with the public interest" is for the Commission.
P. 473.
5. The phrase "compatible with the public interest" includes questions as to the character and amount of the capitalization of the
reorganized corporation; and, so long as legal standards are followed,
the judgment of the Commission on such questions is final. P. 473.
6. In passing upon a plan of reorganization under § 77, the District
Court acts only upon the issues specifically delegated by subsection (e). P. 474.
7. Section 77 (e) authorizes the elimination from participation in the
reorganization of stockholders and creditors whose claims are

valueless. Stich authorization is a valid exercise of the power of
Congress in respect of bankruptcies and does not deprive such
claimants of property without due process of law. P. 475.
8. Neither the Constitution nor the Bankruptcy Act requires the
issuance of warrants to stockholders and creditors whose claims,
found to be without value, have been eliminated from participation
in the reorganization. P. 476.
9. The mere possibility that earnings of the reorganized railroad may
exceed expectations does not justify the issue of securities. P. 476.
10. There was no violation of legal standards in the Commission's
requirement of a capital fund for future routine additions and
betterments; nor in the issue of stock to former holders of interestbearing securities. P. 476.
11. Although § 77 does not contemplate an independent examination
by the court into the determination of value, it does require
that the court be satisfied, upon the record before the Commission
with such additional evidence as may be pertinent to the objections
to the Commission's finding of value, that the statutory requirements
have been followed. P. 477.
12. The Commission's conclusion that certain securities owned by the
debtor, representing interests in two companies operating connecting lines (which securities the debtor had acquired in order that it
might obtain a fair share of the business from and to those lines),
were without value and not entitled to participate in the reorganization-it appearing before the Commission that the debtor had
for ten years contributed substantial sums annually to meet deficits
of each of the companies; although in the District Court it was
shown that the companies were useful auxiliaries to the business of
the debtor-was supported by material evidence and was properly
accepted by the District Court. P. 478.
13. The provision of § 77 (e) that the plan of reorganization need
not be submitted to stockholders and creditors when the Commission
shall have found their claims to be without value "and the judge
shall have affirmed the finding," does not require the court to make
an independent appraisal of the valuation found by the Commission.
P. 478.
14. The court properly affirms the Commission when it finds no legal
objection to the Commission's valuation in determining whether
particular claimants are entitled to participate in the reorganization.
P. 479.
15. Sound railroad reorganization requires consideration of the interest
of the public in an adequate transportation system, properly

financed, and this must be balanced against the satisfaction of
claims, without equity, by the issue of securities without reasonable
opportunities to earn a return. P. 481.
16. ConsolidatedRock Products Co. v. Du Bois, 312 U. S. 510, distinguished. P. 482.
17. In the circumstances here, the determination by the Commission
of the aggregate amount of securities which may be issued by the
reorganized company was in substance a finding of total value for
reorganization purposes; and the lack of a valuation in dollars is
immaterial. P. 483.
18. It was not incumbent upon the Commission to produce data as to
the reproduction cost of the debtor's property. P. 483.
19. The allocation to holders of Trustees' Certificates and the First
Mortgage, although senior creditors, of preferred and common stock
as well as income bonds of the new company, while some of the
new bonds are allocated to bondholders secured by the General
and Refunding Mortgage, who had a first lien on some assets, did
not violate the full priority rule. P. 484.
20. Under the absolute priority rule, the stratification of securities
issued to creditors need not follow invariably the relative priority
of the claimants, so long as they receive full compensatory treatment
and so long as each group shares in the securities of the whole
enterprise on an equitable basis. P. 484.
21. The treatment accorded the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
in the allocation of new securities, in view of the money advanced
by it to the debtor during the reorganization, held not inequitable
to other creditors. P. 485.
22. The Commission's allocation of securities in the plan of reorganization here, was based upon the relative priority, value, and equity
of the various claims of creditors, and its conclusions are in accord
with the requirements and standards of subsections (b), (d) and (e)
(1) of the Act. P. 488.
23. In the interest of expedition, the Court considers here a question
which, though not passed upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
was fully presented by the petition for certiorari, and the decision
of which is essential to a complete review of the District Court.
P. 489.
24. The District Court's conclusions adopting the Commission's tentative determinations as to the priority of the First Mortgage with
respect to the debtor's equity in certain after-acquired rolling stock
and equipment acquired under equipment trusts and a lease; the

debtor's interest in an after-acquired branch line; and the debtor's
title to certain "non-carrier" realty, are here affirmed. Pp. 489, 503.
25. The provision of the plan directing that "All collateral pledged
by the debtor as security for notes to the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, the Railroad Credit Corporation, and the A. C. James
Company shall be reduced to possession by the respective pledgees
thereof, and shall be by them surrendered to the reorganized company and canceled," is sustained. P. 503.
26. The showing made before the District Court as to changed conditions since the certification of the plan by the Commission, affords
no basis for rejection of the Commission's plan. P. 508.
27. The Commission's selection of January 1, 1939, as the effective
date of the plan was within its authority under subsection (b) of

of Appeals in the reorganization of the Western Pacific
Railroad Company under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.
That decree reversed the order of the District Court which
had approved the plan for reorganization certified to it by

the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The petitions for certiorari ask adjudication of questions which are important in the field of railroad reorganization. They involve the respective function of Commission and court, the method of valuation of railroad property by the Commission, the legality of the exclusion of
stockholders and certain creditors from participation in
the estate, a more favorable participation of a Reconstruction Finance Corporation claim because of new
money furnished for the plan, allocation of securities

among claimants, priorities of liens created by different
mortgages and subsidiary issues. Heretofore this Court
has not passed upon them. For their determination we
granted certiorari. 316 U. S. 654.
The debtor railroad company filed its petition in the
District Court for the Northern District of California on
August 2, 1935, alleging its inability to pay and discharge
its indebtedness as it matured and praying for reorganization under § 77. The petition was approved as properly
filed, trustees were appointed, their appointment ratified,
207 I. C. C. 793, and the appropriate steps taken to bring
the plan of reorganization before the Commission for consideration. Public hearings were held by the Commission at which other plans for reorganization were filed, one
by a group of bondholders known as the Institutional
Bondholders Committee and one by the A. C. James Company, a secured creditor of the debtor which also was financially interested in the treatment accorded the preferred
and common stock of the debtor. After full consideration of the problems of the debtor's reorganization and
after the development of a plan deemed in accordance
with § 77, the Commission certified its plan to the District
Court on September 28, 1939.
The Commission's conclusions and orders were reached
upon exceptions to the report of its Bureau of Finance.
Its plan was the outgrowth of a study of the financial condition and economic situation of the debtor, viewed in the
setting of the public interest in a national transportation
system. The competing claims of the various classes of
creditors and stockholders were appraised in the light of
the requirements of the Act that they be accorded fair and
equitable treatment. There is little if any dispute concerning the primary facts from which factual or legal inferences are to be drawn.
The debtor is a California corporation with its principal
operating office in San Francisco. It carries on an interstate railroad business between the States of California,

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

The equipment obligations of $2,750,050 are secured by
rolling stock, acquired free of the liens of mortgages,
through direct liens or trust arrangements. No one disputes the sound character of any of these securities. They
are given priority over the fixed obligations of the reorganized company.
Subject to the trustees' certificates and equipment obligations, the first mortgage 5% bonds of $62,433,876.66, face
and interest to the effective date of the plan, are secured
by prior liens on all valuable property of the debtor, except
(1) money, accounts, operating balances and cash items,
and (2) certain assets, referred to in the next paragraph,
upon which the general and refunding bonds have a first
lien, deemed by the Commission to be of value sufficient
to support $732,010 of new income mortgage bonds and
new preferred stock of $1,147,955 par. The total face and
assumed value of the securities authorized by the plan, as
evidence of the entire value of the system, is $84,000,000
plus. See p. 481, infra. This paragraph reflects our conclusions as to priorities of the liens of the respective mortgages later discussed. See Prioritiesof Conflicting Liens,
p. 489, infra.
The later general and refunding mortgage bonds,
$18,999,500 in face amount, are secured by a first lien on
properties determined by the Commission to be of a value
and earning power sufficient to support issues of new
income bonds and participating preferred stock of $732,010
and $1,147,955, respectively. See 233 I. C. C. 414 et seq.
They are further secured, subject to the prior rights and
other exceptions of the obligations listed in the preceding
paragraphs, by a lien' on all valuable property of the debtor.
All of this series which were issued are pledged to secure
the collateral notes in the amounts indicated in the preceding table.

Finance Corporation, detailed later in the section of this

opinion headed Allocation of Securities, B, p. 485, infra,
the distribution of securities to creditors did not reflect
absolutely their priority position. The collateral notes
owned by the R. F. C. were treated in the distribution of
securities on the same basis as were the claims of old
First bondholders. The result is summarized by the
table on page 461 and footnotes 5 and 6.
By stipulation of the parties, the record shows that the
value of the property of the debtor and its subsidiaries,
"as found by the Interstate Commerce Commission under
Section 19 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, with additions and betterments, new lines and extensions, subsequent to date of valuation, plus non-operating properties," was $150,907,623.49 as of December 31, 1938. It is
further stipulated that there is no deferred maintenance
in the debtor's properties. "Its facilities and equipment
are sufficient to handle expeditiously and efficiently all
traffic reasonably to be anticipated in the immediate future." The value of the debtor's system, with equipment
depreciated, was $144,978,559 as of December 31, 1938.
There is agreement as to the amount of system earnings
available for interest for 1922 to 1939, inclusive. The
amounts follow:

the net income result were placed before and weighed by
the Commission and the District Court. Of course the
fluctuating operating revenues for the periods from
freight, passenger, mail, express, victualing and miscellaneous were considered, as well as the corresponding
labor, power, tax, rental and miscellaneous expenses. Operating ratio percentages for the various years are available in the evidence.
The stipulated operating revenues of the debtor's system for the years 1922-1938 and the first nine months of
1939 are as follows:
1922 ----------- $12, 736, 564
1923 ----------- 14,414,812

Furthermore, the record shows the favorable effect upon
the system's gross operating revenue of the extension of its
lines into Northern California. This new construction,
known as the Northern California Extension, was put into
operation in 1932 and contributed the following gross revenues from freight originating, terminating and passing
over the extension:

The extension is a link in a Pacific coast route created by
this northerly extension and a corresponding southerly
extension by the Great Northern Railroad Company which
join at Bieber, California. The extension cost over ten
million dollars and was built with the expectation, since
realized, of materially increasing the value of the debtor's
property as an operating road. The Commission gave consideration to this factor in estimating the probabilities of
future income.
Prospects for maintaining and increasing the debtor's
traffic and so its net for interest and dividends are influenced by the fact that it depends to a considerable extent

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP.

Opinion of the Court.

upon traffic arrangements with other lines. The debtor's
main line from Oakland, California, to Salt Lake City is
an important section of a through route from the Pacific
coast to the Midwest. In conjunction with the Denver &
Rio Grande Western and the Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company it offers fast through schedules. The Denver &
Rio Grande Western completed, in 1934, the Dotsero Cutoff. This cutoff and the Moffatt Tunnel, a nearby improvement of the Denver and Salt Lake, used together
materially shorten the railroad distance between Pacific
coast and Midwest points and open to passenger traffic a
scenic route of great beauty. The hearings on reorganization make these facts as to the likelihood of increased traffic
available to the Commission and court.
These basic factors of physical condition, traffic, gross
and net income et cetera were before the Commission and
the courts. From them there was to be projected an estimate as to the future from which was to be drawn a present
valuation of the property and its ability to carry by its
earnings a certain volume in dollars of securities. There
are no assets of significant worth which are not in active
use as producers of income. Relying largely upon past
earnings, the Commission found "that the fixed interest
charges of the reorganized company should not initially
and substantially exceed $500,000, if the reorganized company is to maintain its property properly and secure necessary new capital in the future." It further determined
that the plan should provide a capital fund for future
routine additions and betterments. This was estimated
to require $500,000 annually.' Carrying charges of
$94,202 on existing equipment trusts were to be assumed
4230 I. C. C. 91: "Annual payments into the fund should be $500,000
or such lesser sum as may be required, together with unappropriated
accumulations in the fund as of the close of the calendar year prior to
that for which the payment is to be computed, less charges for additions and betterments during the latter year, to bring the total in the

fund to $1,000,000."

by the reorganized corporation. A new $10,000,000 first
mortgage 4% bond issue was allotted $400,000 annually.
These fixed charges aggregate $994,202. In addition to
the fixed charges, the Commission determined the system
reasonably could carry another $1,000,000 of contingent
charges. Thus the over-all charge for annual fixed and
contingent interest, capital and sinking funds was limited
to approximately $2,000,000 per annum. Income mortgage 4 % bonds were authorized in the amount of
$21,219,075. Their annual interest comes to $954,858 and
their one-half per cent sinking fund calls for $106,095.
In view of the foregoing limitation, capitalization of the
reorganized company was fixed at $2,750,050 of undisturbed equipment obligations, $10,000,000 of first mortgage 4% bonds, $21,219,075 of income mortgage 41/2%
bonds, $31,850,297 of 5% preferred stock, and 319,441
shares of common stock without par value.' These issues

common stock, being the amount of common stock which bears to the
amount of common stock allotted to the claim of the Credit Corporation the same proportion that the principal amount of general and

by the Credit Corporation for its claim." The result of the distribution per dollar of indebtedness is set out in the Commission's reports.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

The Commission found, correlative to and as a basis for
its allocation of securities, that "the equity of the existing
stock has no value, and hence holders of such stock are
not entitled to participate in the plan. Further, considering that the reorganized company's income available for
interest and dividends must total $4,318,035,[*] plus any
undistributed profits tax that will be payable, before dividends of $3 per share may be paid on the new common
stock, it is clear that, even though all the securities remaining available for distribution after satisfying the claims
of the first-mortgage bondholders are allotted to the other
secured creditors, such securities will be inadequate in
value to satisfy their claims. For this reason, and for the
reasons stated with respect to the finding that the equity
of the existing stock has no value, we find that the claims
of the unsecured creditors, of the Western Pacific Railroad Corporation, and of the Western Realty Company,
have no value, and hence no securities or cash should be
distributed under the plan in respect of those claims."

The plan and a transcript of the proceedings before the
Commission were duly certified to the District Court. In

entire property, of the respective portions of it covered

Function of the Court. The conclusion of the Court of
Appeals as to the necessity for a detailed valuation springs
from its interpretation of the statute as to the function of
the District Court in reorganizations. That court had
said in its opinion:
"It cannot be gainsaid that the Commission knows all
about the Debtor, its property, its history, financial and
otherwise, its traffic and revenue, and its financial structure. No official body in the country is better qualified,
by reason of experience, ability and specialized knowledge
than is the Commission to find the ultimate facts as to
the Debtor in relation to any of the matters mentioned."
In re Western Pacific R. ,Co., 34 F. Supp. 493, 501.
Commenting upon this, the Court of Appeals said:
"The statement indicates a possible misconception ...
"In determining whether a plan of reorganization satisfies the requirements of subsection e, the court is not concluded by any determination made by the Commission,
but may, and must, exercise its own independent judgment; and this is true whether such determination relates to value or to some other subject. Initially, however, the duty of determining the value of any property
for any purpose under § 77 rests on the Commission, not
provided for by the plan, or when retained by the debtor pursuant to
the plan, shall be free and clear of all claims of the debtor, its stockholders and creditors, and the debtor shall be discharged from its debts
and liabilities, except such as may consistently with the provisions of
the plan be reserved in the order confirming the plan or directing such
transfer and conveyance or retention, and the judge may require the
trustee or trustees appointed hereunder, the debtor, any mortgagee, the
trustee of any obligation of the debtor, and all other proper and
necessary parties, to make any such transfer or conveyance, and may
require the debtor to join in any such transfer or conveyance made
by the trustee or trustees. . .'

on the court." In re Western Pacific R. Co., 124 F. 2d
136, 140.
Petitioners in Nos. 7, 8 and 33 seek review of this last
ruling. Their petitions for certiorari query whether § 77
does not vest
"in the Commission exclusive jurisdiction (subject only to
review for arbitrary exercise) to determine whether a railroad reorganization plan is 'compatible with the public
interest,' including jurisdiction to determine total capitalization, the classification thereof, and the financial details
of each class of proposed capitalization?"
This summary sufficiently identifies the issue without the
necessity of elaborating differentiations in the petitioners'
present views or of determining the degree of difference
between the views of the district and appellate courts as
to the function of the court under § 77.
The opinion shows the -attitude of the District Court, 34
F. Supp. 493, 503, 504: "The capitalization permitted by
these earnings is a mere matter of computation, which will
demonstrate that the Commission did not act arbitrarily
in limiting capitalization nor the respective classes thereof. ...

"The determination of the amount and character of the
capitalization (a legislative function affecting the public
interest) is exclusively within the province of the Commission. The only qualification, if any, is that the court
shall independently determine whether, in the exercise of
its jurisdiction, the Commission has acted fairly, within
the bounds of the Constitution, and not arbitrarily."
Upon the other findings of the Commission, the District
Court exercised an independent judgment based upon the
record and the findings of the Commission together with
additional evidence produced before the court by the parties. 34 F. Supp. 493, 505.

These reorganizations require something more than contests between adversary interests to produce plans which
are fair and in the public interest. When the public interest, as distinguished from private, bulks large in the
problem, the solution is largely a function of the legislative and administrative agencies of government with their
facilities and experience in investigating all aspects of
the problem and appraising the general interest.8 Congress outlined the course reorganization is to follow. It
established standards for administration and placed in the
hands of the Commission the primary responsibility for

the development of a guitable plan. When examined to
learn the purpose of its enactment, § 77 manifests the intention of Congress to place reorganization under the
leadership of the Commission, subject to a degree of participation by the court.
It is clear from the discussions and the statute itself
that there was recognition by everyone of the advantages
of utilizing the facilities of the Commission for investigation into the many-sided problems of transportation service, finance and public interest involved in even minor
railroad reorganizations and utilizing the Commission's
experience in these fields for the appraisals of values and
the development of a plan of reorganization, fair to the
public, creditors and stockholders. The resulting legislation was an attempted balance between the power of the
Commission and that of the court.
As to the court's place in reorganization, the present
statute does not vary greatly from the first legislative ef8 Cf. Hearings on H. R. 7432, House Committee on Interstate and

fort, enacted March 3, 1933, to reorganize railroads unable
to meet their obligations."0 The amendments of 1935
were primarily designed to cure defects disclosed by practical experience." Both acts are bottomed upon the
theory of debtor rehabilitation by adjustment of creditors' claims. Such treatment was essential for embarrassed railroads, as ordinary bankruptcy liquidation or
judicial sales were impossible because of the size of their
indebtedness and the paucity of buyers. The acts were
a part of the relief granted financially involved corporations, public and private, in the depression years of the
early thirties.1 Since railroads could not take advantage
of the Bankruptcy Act, § 4, 11 U. S. C. § 22, their financial
adjustments for years had been carried out in equity receiverships under judicial control. These were cumbersome, costly and privately managed with inadequate consideration for the public interest in a soundly financed
transportation system. Chicago, M. & St. P. Investigation, 131 I. C. C. 615, 671; United States v. Chicago, M.,

This substitution of the Commission for an equity receivership under court direction was criticized and amendments suggested to "eliminate all confusion in regard to
the functions to be exercised by the commission and by
the court, . . . and [to] remove the most fundamental
objections to the bill in its present form." " Notwithstanding the criticism the bill passed the House with the
power lodged in the Commission, as originally proposed.
When the House bill for the relief of debtors " was reported by the Senate Committee, the railroad section was

and the Commission. 8 While the most important amendment was to furnish means to avoid the obstruction of
dissatisfied classes of creditors or stockholders by making
a fair and equitable plan effective over dissenters, the requirement of co6rdinated action by Commission and court
was retained.
The Senate Report, No. 1336, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.,
concluded:
"The amendments to section 77 leave unimpaired the
power and the duty of the commission and the courts to
deal with the most important feature of all reorganization plans, that of the control of the reorganized company;
and similarly the commission and courts will continue to
have the power and authority of making that thorough
investigation which is necessary to assure sound and reliable control for bankrupt companies when they emerge
from the courts, in place of the type of control under which
some railroads have been wrecked."
Under the present statute the District Court has definite responsibility in reorganization. Subsection (e).
After the certification from the Commission is filed, a
hearing is authorized at which all interested parties may
appear. Additional evidence of opponents and proponents of the plan may be received upon "detailed and specific objections in writing to the plan and their claims for
equitable treatment." The judge shall then "approve
the plan, if satisfied that: (1) It complies with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, is fair and equitable, affords due recognition to the rights of each class of

and allowances. If the plan is disapproved, the proceedings may be dismissed or referred back to the Commission for further consideration. On approval by the judge
the plan is returned to the Commission for submission to
stockholders and creditors for their approval. Submission to classes of stockholders or creditors may be omitted
on a finding by the Commission, affirmed by the judge,
of a lack of value in the equity of the stockholders or the
claims of the creditors. On certification of the results of
the submission the judge shall confirm the plan finally, if
satisfied the requisite approval has been obtained or is
excused for reasons stated in subsection (e). The judge
is not empowered to approve or confirm any plan until it
has first been approved by the Commission and certified
to the court. Subsection (d).
The power of the court does not extend to participation
in all responsibilities of the Commission. Valuation is a
function limited to the Commission, without the necessity
of approval by the court. The first sentence of the last
paragraph of subsection (e) provides:
"If it shall be necessary to determine the value of any
property for any purpose under this section, the Commission shall determine such value and certify the, same to
the court in its report on the plan."
The function of valuation thus left to the Commission is
the determination of the worth of the property valued,
whether stated in dollars, in securities or otherwise. One
of the primary objects of the bill was the elimination of
obstructive litigation on the issue of valuation 19 and the

form finally chosen approached as near to that position as
seemed to the draftsmen legally possible. Judicial reexamination was not considered desirable." None of the
findings required of the judge under subsection ge) relate
specifically to valuation. Congress apparently intended
to leave the determination of valuation "of any property
for any purpose under this section" to the Commission. 2"
The language chosen leaves to the Commission, we think,
the determination of value without the necessity of a reexamination by the court, when that determination is
reached with material evidence to support the conclusion
and in accordance with legal standards. It leaves open the
question of whether in reaching the result the Commission
had applied improper statutory standards. This latter
point is discussed under the heading of Method of Valuation in this opinion, p. 477, infra, where this plan is reviewed and upheld in this respect.
Another restriction on court action is that the determination as to whether the plan is "compatible with the public interest" rests, as valuation does, with the Commission.
Subsection (d). Without attempting to forecast the limits of the phrase as used in the setting of this statute, it is
sufficient in this case to determine, as we do, that it includes the amount and character of the capitalization of

whether it would be legally valid to make the valuation of the Commission final in practice. This was not denied although doubt was
expressed whether the Commission's finding could preclude a certain
limited amount of judicial review. See Hearings on H. R. 6249, supra,

Securities Co. v. United States, 287 U. S. 12, 24. Leaving
the problems of public interest to the Commission was not
a departure from precedent. The phrase had been employed long before in the grant of authority to supervise
the issue of securities. § 2 0a, Interstate Commerce Act.2"
The problems of capitalization are of public interest.
The corporate form is universally used for the business of
railroading. Railroad securities are widely distributed in
investment portfolios and among individual savers. The
reasonable earning power of securities, the terms and conditions of the respective issues, and the soundness of the
aggregate capitalization affect the public interest immediately and directly. Capitalization is an essential factor
bearing on an efficient transportation system for shipper,
investor and consumer. The development of the capitalization of the reorganized company which is entrusted
solely to the Commission under the requirement that the
plan be compatible with the public interest is that relating to the total amount of issuable securities and the quality of the securities to be issued. So long as legal
standards are followed, the judgment of the Commission
on such capitalization is final.
Thus limited, the District Court acts concerning the
plans only upon the issues specifically delegated by subsection (e). As to these, its powers are negative. It may
veto the plan in its entirety but may improve it only by
suggestion. It becomes a necessary and important factor
"The Commission shall make such order only if it finds that such
issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate
purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary
or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the
carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not
impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose." 49 U. S. C. § 20a (2).

in railroad reorganization. These reorganizations may be
attained only through properly co6rdinated action between the Commission and the court.28 In this case, we
are of the view that the District Court performed its required functions in accordance with the requirements of
the statute. See page 466, supra.
Amount and Character of Capitalization. While the
public interest phase of capitalization is not to be independently passed upon by the court, the court does have
statutory authority to review for obedience to legal standards.2 Petitioners in seeking certiorari and now on the
merits concede that the exclusive power in the Commission to pass upon the amount and character of capitalization is subject to review for "arbitrary exercise." The respondent A. C. James Company makes the point that the
restriction of the amount of capitalization to an aggregate
limited by the reasonable probability of a fair return deprives those creditors and stockholders who are barred as
holding claims without value, of their property interest in
the debtor without due process and contrary to the mandate of § 77. The Commission thought that the public interest required a capital structure which would give the
reorganized company "a reasonable opportunity to function efficiently and continuously" and that "proposed
charges, whether fixed or contingent, shall be within its
probable earning power." 230 I. C. C. at 87.
Assuming at this point that the Commission's valuation
is sound and reached by allowable methods, a matter discussed later in this opinion at page 477, we hold that the
elimination of the claims of stockholders and creditors

which are valueless from participation in the reorganization is in accordance with valid provisions of § 77 (e)."
Actual bankruptcy means a loss to some investors. Subsection (e) recognizes this inevitable result and provides
a method for their elimination from the reorganization
proceedings. After all of the reasonable value had been
exhausted by senior securities, warrants might have been
authorized for otherwise unsatisfied claims. Such warrants would represent merely the possibility of recoupment, just as the equity of redemption in judicial sales.
But there is no constitutional or statutory requirement
that such immediately valueless paper should be issued.
A mere possibility that traffic might be found to the limit
of the physical capacity of the system is not the kind of
earning power which justifies the issue of securities based
upon such a possibility. Whatever may be the limits of
the power of the Commission to find claims worthless, the
present plan may not be successfully attacked on the
ground that Congress is powerless to authorize in bankruptcy the elimination of claims without value. In re
620 ChurchSt. Corp., 299 U. S. 24.
Nor do we find violation of legal standards in the requirement by the Commission for a capital fund or the
issue of stock to former holders of interest-bearing securities. The Commission is charged with the development
of a plan which must balance and choose between public
and private interests. The evidence before the Commission gave grounds for the finding of a normal requirement
of an annual $500,000 fund for improvements. It is reasonable to agree with the Commission that a substantial
share of the securities should be fixed stock investments
rather than that the entire aggregate amount, justified by

committee. Hearings on H. R. 6249, supra, n. 19, pp. 26, 80, 107, 118,

estimates of probable earnings, should be in interestbearing loans, which ultimately must be redeemed. Stock
which has no retirement provisions is the backbone of a
corporate structure.
Method of Valuation. While by the terms of the statute the valuation of the property is left to the Commission,
without participation by the court, this valuation must be
made in accordance with the direction of the statute and
as to that valuation is subject to judicial review. This review is limited in character by the direction of subsection
(e) that valuation shall be determined by the Commission. The District Court may review to determine
whether the Commission has followed the statutory mandates of subsection (e). Subsection (e) requires valuations by the Commission to be "determined on a basis
which will give due consideration to the earning power of
the property, past, present, and prospective, and all other
relevant facts. In determining such value only such effect
shall be given to the present cost of reproduction new and
less depreciation and original cost of the property, and the
actual investment therein, as may be required under the
law of the land, in light of its earning power and all other
relevant facts." Thus, while judicial review does not
involve an independent examination into valuation, it
does require that the court shall be satisfied, upon the
record before the Commission, with such additional evidence as may be pertinent to the objections to the Commission's finding of value, that the statutory requirements
have been followed.
An example of this type of review occurs in this record.
The Irving Trust Company, as Refunding Mortgage
Trustee in Nos. 7 and 8, and the A. C. James Company

California Traction Company and $465,300, par value,

of the capital stock of the Alameda Belt Line, pledged
only under the Refunding Mortgage, had no material
value. 233 I. C. C. 414-416. These securities were owned
solely by the debtor but in the case of the first company
represented a one-third interest in the Traction Company
and in the case of the second a one-half interest in the
Belt Line. Competing transcontinental railroads owned
the other interests. The respective ownerships were acquired to put the debtor in a position to obtain its fair
share of the business from and to these feeder lines. The
facts before the Commission showed that, over the preceding decade, the debtor had contributed annually substantial sums to meet the deficits of each of the companies.
It was shown in the District Court that each of the companies were useful auxiliaries to the business of the debtor.
However, valuation is essentially a problem for the Commission. There is material evidence to support its conclusion of lack of value and its conclusion has been
accepted by the District Court. This is sufficient.
In the preceding section of this opinion, we discussed
the validity of the provision of subsection (e) which permits the elimination from the reorganization of claimants without equity in the debtor's properties. This provision needs also to be considered from the standpoint of
statutory review of the Commission's action. As to both
stockholders and creditors the section requires that a plan
which allows nothing to their claims, need not be submitted to them, if the worthlessness of their claims is found
by the Commission, "and the judge shall have affirmed the
finding." As to certain creditors and all stockholders in
this case, both events took place. The specificity of the
direction for reexamination of the Commission's action
points to a wider scope of review than an inquiry as to
whether statutory standards for valuation have been
followed. It is obvious that the valuation of the whole

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 470
448

Opinion of the Court.

of a debtor's property, in a simple case without conflicting or divisional liens, will mark, by a mere mathematical
computation as to priorities, the claimants who must be
found to be without equity in whole or in part. But we
think the requirement of affirmation of the exclusion of
claimants does not require an independent appraisal of
the valuation which ordained their elimination. The
court properly affirms the Commission, when it finds no
legal objection to the Commission's use of its own valuation to determine whether particular claimants are entitled to participate in the reorganization. For example,
there may arise controversies over the priority or the
validity of claims. A Commission finding involving such
problems would require an independent examination and
an affirmation by the court.
The Circuit Court of Appeals found error in the Commission's failure to make definite valuations. It was of
the view that it was necessary to determine the values of
the respective claims in order to have a basis for the distribution of new assets.' 6 This position respondents de26 In re Western Pacific R. Co., 124 F. 2d 136, 139: "To determine

fend, at least to the point of saying that claims may not
be foreclosed or new securities allocated without a determination of the value of the property and the assets subject to secured claims, as well as earning power. The
Commission considered the debtor's investment in its
bonds, it was necessary to determine the value of (1) the property
subject to the refunding mortgage only and (2) the property subject
both to the refunding mortgage and to the first mortgage now outstanding. This, of course, necessitated a determination as to which
of the debtor's property is, and which is not, subject to each mortgage. Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Du Bois, supra.
"To determine the value of the new first mortgage bonds, income
bonds, new preferred stock and new common stock mentioned above,
it was necessary to determine the value of (1) the debtor's entire property, (2) the property which would be subject to the new first mortgage and (3) the property which would be subject to the income
mortgage.
"Subsection e of § 77 provides: 'If it shall be necessary to determine the value of any property for any purpose under this section, the [Interstate Commerce] Commission shall determine such
value and certify the same to the court in its report on the plan.' In
this case, as has been seen, it was necessary to determine the value
of (1) the debtor's entire property, (2) each of the claims of Reconstruction Finance Corporation, (3) the claim of Railroad Credit
Corporation, (4) the claim of A. C. James Company, (5) the claims
of the holders of first mortgage bonds now outstanding, (6) the $10,000,000 of new first mortgage bonds, (7) the $21,219,075 of income

property, 230 I. C. C. 61, 65, its value for rate making
purposes, id., 76, and the record of its earnings, id., 73 et
seq., together with its volume of traffic and other pertinent
data. It concluded that these factors would justify fixed
and contingent charges of no more than two million dollars annually. In addition, the Commission's plan provided for five per cent preferred stock and common stock
in such amounts that it would require aggregate available
annual earnings of a little more than four and a half million dollars to permit payment of a three per cent dividend. Without appraising the effect of income taxation
o0 the remainder of earnings available and partly used
for interest, it is significant that only three years in the
period from 1922 to 1940 showed earnings available for
interest of over four million. See page 457, supra. With
this data, the Commission determined the new capital
structure. See page 461, supra. Taking the lowest value
for the no par suggested by the Commission, $57 per share,
note 6, supra, there is a total value of securities of eightyfour million dollars plus. The Commission was thus of
the view that the value of the property for purposes of
reorganization was around this figure.
The Commission was familiar with railroad securities.
Control over their issue by interstate carriers has been for
many years in the Commission. § 20 (a), Interstate
Commerce Act. The standards for issuance under § 20 (a)
include "compatible with the public interest." Cf. New
York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U. S.
12, 24. The provisions of this § 20 (a) were carried into
and made a part of the reorganization section by subsections (c) (3) and (f). To create securities with voting
power, in addition to those authorized, might well divorce
control from real ownership. Sound railroad reorganization involves more than the partitioning of assets among
creditors with valuable claims and the distribution to

creditors and stockholders without equity of so-called
securities representing chances for then unforeseeable
profits. The interest of the public in an adequate transportation service must receive consideration. New England Divisions Case, 261 U. S. 184, 189. Important property rights must be balanced against the need of sound
financing. Consequently, the Commission limited the
fixed and contingent charges involving the debt which
must ultimately be paid, to two million annually, with
stock representing the possibility of additional earnings.
See note 5, supra,230 1. C. C. 61, 92.
It is said that Consolidated Rock Co. v. Du Bois, 3i2
U. S. 510, .forbids the substitution of an approved capital
structure for determinations of value. In that case there
was no finding of the values of the property involved and
this Court said: "Absent the requisite valuation data, the
court was in no position to exercise the 'informed, independent judgment' (National Surety Co. v. Coriell, 289
U. S. 426, 436) which appraisal of the fairness of a plan of
reorganization entails," page 520. The District Court, it
being a §77B reorganization, was required to make the
requisite valuations. The requirements for valuation are
the same in a § 77B proceeding as in a railroad reorganization. There is nothing, however, in the Du Bois case to
indicate that dollar valuations of the property or claims
are essential for recapitalization or the distributions of
securities in reorganizations. The defect in Du Bois was
not the failure to find dollar values but the failure to find
the worth of the security behind independent mortgages
on distinct properties and of assets subject to the claims
of particular groups of creditors. Such findings were
required in that case because the court was dealing with
a parent and two subsidiaries with inter-company accounts. Each subsidiary entity had its own creditors.
The system was a unified operation and we held the claims

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 483
448

Opinion of the Court.

against the subsidiaries had priority over stockholders
equity in the parent, p. 523. Without a separate valuation of assets, it was impossible to tell what assets of the
parent were left to form the basis for the securities distributed to the parent's stockholders. In Du Bois, as
here, the manner of reaching that valuation, so long as it
complies with the statutory standards, is not important.
There are subsidiaries here but there are no claimants of
the subsidiaries looking to the parent. The aggregate of
the authorized securities in the present case is to be equitably distributed among claimants against a single corporation. Findings were made as to the property covered
by the different mortgages of the debtor and securities
allocated on the basis of that finding. 230 I. C. C. 61, 98,
99, 100, 101; 233 I. C. C. 409, 414. Under such circumstances the lack of a valuation in dollars is immaterial.
The important element is the allocation of the securities
so as to preserve to creditors the advantages of their respective priorities. That is to say, senior claims first
receive securities of a worth sufficient to cover their face
and interest before junior claims receive anything. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the determination
by the Commission of the aggregate amount of securities
which may be issued against the system is in substance
a finding of total value for reorganization purposes. In
view of the factors of value considered and the opportunity given all parties before the Commission and the court
to present all desired evidence, the Commission's determination stands upon a firm basis. There is no more important element in the valuation of commercial properties
than earnings. 7 No offer was made to produce figures
upon reproduction cost. It was not incumbent upon the
Commission to do so. The Commission's conclusions
impress us as in accord with the statutory requirements.

Allocation of Securities. There are two issues collateral to the Commission's valuation. One relates to adverse claims of prior liens between the holders of bonds
secured on the one hand by the General and Refunding
Mortgage and on the other by the First Mortgage. See
p. 489, infra. The other is as to the correctness of the allocation of securities among the creditors. This latter
issue is, of course, affected by the former. In considering allocation, we shall assume at this point what we later
find, that the Commission's determination as to priorities
is correct.
A. The allocation of securities is shown above at page
461. The table sets out that the holders of the Trustees'
Certificates and the 5% First Mortgages, although they
are senior creditors, receive large quantities of preferred
and common stock, as well as new income bonds. These
stocks are securities of lower dignity than the income
bonds. Some of these bonds on the other hand go to
creditors secured by the refunding bonds. This is because the refunding bonds have a first lien on some assets.
233 I. C. C. 414. But at any rate, under the absolute
priority rule of the Boyd case, 8 the stratification of securities issued to creditors need not follow invariably the relative priority of the claimants. 9 Apropos of a somewhat
similar situation, we said in ConsolidatedRock Co. v. Du
Bois, 312 U. S. at p. 530:
"If the creditors are adequately compensated for the
loss of their prior claims, it is not material out of what assets they are paid. So long as they receive full compensatory treatment and so long as each group shares in the
securities of the whole enterprise on an equitable basis,
the requirements of 'fair and equitable' are satisfied."

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 485
448

Opinion of the Court.

B. A point is made as to the treatment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation's claims in the distribution
of securities. It is to be noted, p. 455, supra, that R. F. C.
has two kinds of claims; one for $10,000,000 upon Trustees' Certificates for money advanced to the debtor while
in reorganization, the other for $2,963,000 Collateral
Notes, secured by refunding mortgage bonds. The Railroad Credit Corporation and the A. C. James Company
are holders of similar collateral notes. The amount of
bonds, as compared with the face principal of the indebtedness, varies. The R. F. C. has the most valuable collateral per dollar of indebtedness. To retire the Trustees' Certificates and to raise necessary new money for
the reorganization, the Commission deemed it essential
to sell $10,000,000 of new first mortgage, 4% bonds of
1974. To assure this, the Commission provided:
"That the [R. F. C.] purchase the bonds at par and accrued interest and that, in consideration of such purchase
and the value of the collateral securing its claim, the
Finance Corporation receive, for the secured notes of the
debtor held by it, treatment equal to that accorded the
holders of the debtor's existing first-mortgage bonds."
Respondents' objections to this ruling are that the
Commission acted without a finding of the value of the
new bonds or their marketability at par, that the advancement of the R. F. C. secured claim to priority over the like
claims of other holders violates absolute priority and
that there is no finding of reasonable equivalence between
the preference and the value of R. F. C.'s taking the
bonds. It is further urged that securities distributed to
the R. F. C. to refinance the Trustees' Certificates "should
be in recognition of the priority inherent in that transaction" and not in connection with the loan of R. F. C.
to the debtor, which was made prior to reorganization
proceedings.

486

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

It is admitted that the $10,000,000 Trustees' Certificates or such of them as are presently held by the R. F. C.
are worth par. No finding was made by the Commission
of the value of the new Firsts. Evidence before the court
showed them of a value between 80 and 90 and of poor
marketability on account of the system's interest record.
The court made no finding as to either.
If the R. F. C. were treated on its notes, on the basis of
the proportion of bonds held as collateral, precisely as the
other noteholders, it would receive $414,175 of income
mortgage bonds and $649,516 of new preferred stock, in
addition to its proportion of common stock. 233 I. C. C.
409, 416. This proportion of common stock would allot
a much greater aggregate of common stock to the R. F. C.
than it obtained by the adjustment. By reason of accepting the less valuable new Firsts in lieu of cash for its
$10,000,000 Trustees' Certificates, it will receive for the
principal of its claims $1,185,200 of new income bonds and
$1,777,800 of new preferred stock. The R. F. C. received
its unpaid interest in no par common stock at $57 per
share. This is the same allocation given claimants who
hold the old Firsts. 233 I. C. C. 409, 452. The other noteholders received a large proportion of the principal of their
claims in no par common stock at $62 per share.
It is difficult to appraise in dollars, as of the date of the
Commission approval, the advantage secured for the plan
by the arrangement with R. F. C. It is equally difficult
to appraise similarly as of that date the value of the
Trustees' Certificates relinquished by the R. F. C. over the
value of the new Firsts or to determine how much of additional worth the R. F. C. obtained. The argument that the
Commission does not have statutory authority to pay a
creditor, even R. F. C., a government banking corporation,
for furnishing new money has little weight. Nor do we
see any reason why all claims of R. F. C. may not be considered by the Commission as a single claim. Consolidated

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 487

Opinion of the Court.

Rock Co. v. Du Bois, 312 U. S. 510, 520. There is nothing
to lead us to a conclusion that the Commission gave any
advantage to R. F. C. for which full consideration was not
given. New-money, the Commission said, "is absolutely
necessary to effect a reorganization." 233 I. C. C. 409, 414.
We have no reason to think the Commission allowed more
compensation for this new money to R. F. C. than it would
have been compelled to allow in some way, by interest or
additional collateral or otherwise to another supplier. We
conclude there was nothing in the discretionary action of
the Commission to justify its invalidation.
C. We have held hereinbefore that valuation might be
made by a method based primarily upon earnings and that
so long as creditors receive "full compensatory treatment"
their priorities may be represented by securities of different ranks. The Commission has made allocations of
securities to the various creditors according to its judgment
of the worth of their creditor position or priority in relation
to the total worth of the property. It has found specifically that certain claims, under its valuations, have no
value. We have pointed out the evidence before the Commission on the question of value. We cannot see that putting definitive dollar values on the whole and on parts of
this property would aid the Commission in its work of
valuation or the courts in their limited review of the
Commission's action.
By its order of June 21, 1939, section P, 233 I. C. C. 441,
451, confirmed September 19, 1939, 236 I. C. C. 1, the
Commission authorized the issue of around eighty-four
million dollars of securities against the system property.
This treats the equipment trusts and the securities with a
face value as worth par and the no par common stock at
$57 per share for all recognized creditors except the Railroad Credit Corporation and the A. C. James Company.
For distribution to these latter two creditors, the common
was valued at $62.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

The Commission had before it the data pertaining to
past traffic, receipts, earnings and operating ratios, the
system's physical condition and prospects for business.
This gave an adequate basis for an intelligent estimate of
future income likely to be available to meet annual charges
before dividends and those dividends themselves.
From this information, a conclusion was reached as to
the debts which could be paid in the order of their full or
absolute priority. Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Co., 308
U. S. 106,117. The secured claim of A. C. James Company
could not be satisfied in full even with the more liberal
valuation of the common stock. Claims of lesser dignity
were eliminated. Those entitled to priority over the mortgages, that is, current liabilities, trustees obligations and
reorganization expenses, were to be satisfied by cash or
assumed by the reorganized company as a charge on its
assets superior to the new securities. 233 I. C. C. 409, 452;
230 I. C. C. 61,100,101,102. This left as creditors only the
holders of the old 5% Firsts, with, an underlying mortgage
on the greater part of the property, the R. F. C., the Railroad Credit Corporation and the A. C. James Company,
the latter three with refunding mortgage bonds as collateral. We have already explained the arrangement
whereby R. F. C. acquired the status of a first mortgage
bondholder. Here it is sufficient to say that as determined
by the Commission the Refundings had a lien superior to
the Firsts on some assets (233 I. C. C. 414), and the First
superiority over the Refunding on the major portion. 230

Prioritiesof Conflicting Liens. No. 61 is a petition by
the Irving Trust Company, trustee of the General and
Refunding Mortgage, which raises questions of the
priority between the Refunding Mortgage and the First
Mortgage as a lien on three classes of property. These are
the debtor's equity in certain rolling stock and equipment
acquired under equipment trusts and a lease, the debtor's
interest in the Northern California Extension and the
debtor's title to certain "non-carrier" property. The Commission's plan is predicated on the priority of the First
Mortgage as a lien on these properties and the Commission
accordingly undertook tentatively to determine the legal
questions involved. The Commission held that the First
Mortgage, senior to the Refunding Mortgage, should be
considered to be a first lien on these three classes of property. Petitioner, the Irving Trust Company, as substituted trustee under the Refunding Mortgage, made appropriate objections but the ruling of the Commission
was adopted by the District Court. In reversing on
appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals did not pass on the
question though the issue was presented. The point is
made here by a party prevailing below, the petitioner
Irving Trust Company, on behalf of holders of refunding
mortgage bonds. As the matter is fully presented by the
petition for certiorari and its decision is essential to a
complete review of the District Court we have concluded
to consider the question. § 240 (a) Judicial Code, 28 U. S.

The issues are those of construction of the terms of the
First Mortgage. In the case of the first two classes of
property, which were acquired after 1916, the year of
the mortgage, the question is whether such property is
covered by the after-acquired property clauses of that
indenture and in the case of the third class, the "noncarrier" real property, the question is the application of
the granting clauses to property not intimately connected
with the operation of the road at the time of the 1916
reorganization of the debtor. None of the parties relies,
at least as to personalty, on the controlling nature of rules
of law of a particular jurisdiction. The Commission
treated the question as one of the interpretation of the
language of the mortgage and we shall do likewise.
A. As to the first class of property, it is the contention
of the trustee of the Refunding Mortgage that the debtor's
equity in the rolling stock subject to the three equipment
trusts and the lease is not subject to the lien of the First
Mortgage and that it is subject to the lien of the Refunding Mortgage. Since nothing turns on the difference between the equipment trusts and the lease, they will not
further be distinguished. This equity is stipulated to
have been worth over $6,000,000 on December 31, 1935,
the nearest date available to August 21, 1935, the date
of the filing of the petition. Since the obligations secured
by all the refunding mortgage bonds outstanding amount
to eleven millions it is apparent that determination of this
question in favor of the refunding mortgage bondholders
would go far towards assuring them equality of treatment
with first mortgage bondholders.
The equipment trusts, the usual method of financing the
acquisition of rolling stock, were created in 1923, 1924,
1929 and 1931. All are dated between the execution of
the First Mortgage and the Refunding Mortgage. Under
all, as is usual, the trustee retained title to the equipment,

the debtor's equity in the property increasing as it satisfied the serially maturing obligations. The obligations
of two of the trusts have become fully satisfied since the
institution of this proceeding.
The first of the granting clauses of the First Mortgage
conveys presently owned railroad lines, equipment and
other property formerly the property of the debtor's predecessor and specifically enumerating, under the subheading "equipment," several varieties of cars and "other
rolling stock." Granting clause third, entitled "afteracquired property," covers
"Any and all property and facilities of any and every
kind and description, including . . . equipment . . . and

any and all right, title and interest in any of such properties or facilities which may from time to time hereafter
be acquired or constructed by or belong to" the debtor, if
such property falls into any one of four categories:
(1) Property acquired "by the use of First Mortgage
Bonds or proceeds thereof or cash deposited" under the
first mortgage "or on account of the purchase, acquisition
or construction thereof or work thereon" such bonds or
sums are paid out; or
(2) Property constituting "an integral part or parts of
lines of railroad, extensions, branches, or other property
subject to the lien" of the first mortgage; or
(3) Property "used or acquired for use in or for the
maintenance or operation of or appertaining to" any of
the property subject to the lien of the first mortgage; or
(4) Property consisting of securities of or other interest
in the property of the Salt Lake City Union Depot &
Railroad Company or Standard Realty and Development
Company, or any subsidiary as defined.
The fifth granting clause covers a great variety of properties and facilities used in the operation of a railroad,

492

including tracks, bridges, tunnels, telegraph and telephone
lines, floating equipment and specifically several kinds of
cars "and other rolling stock and equipment" and "all
other property of every description and all rights and interests in or with respect to the use of property;
"provided that the foregoing or any thereof, whether now
owned by the Company or at any time hereafter acquired
by it . . . shall be appurtenant to or used or held for use

as, or as a part or as parts of, or to facilitate or safeguard
the maintenance or operation of, any lines of railroad,
extensions, branches .. .or other properties now or at

any time hereafter subject to the lien of this indenture.

Following the habendum clause is a proviso, hereafter
referred to by its two opening words, reading:
"Subject, However, as to all equipment now owned to
the equipment trust or conditional sale agreements secured thereon, and as to equipment hereafter acquired, to
the equipment trust or conditional sale agreements to
which the same shall be subject as permitted hereby,-..
30 This clause also grants "any and all replacements, renewals, improvements and betterments of and additions to" any of the lines or
property subject to the lien of the mortgage. In view of the holding
as to the effect of those clauses quoted in the text it will be unnecessary to consider the contention of the trustee of the First Mortgage
that this clause, as supplemented by certain covenants, independently
subjects the debtor's equity in equipment trust rolling stock to the
lien of the mortgage.
There are six granting clauses. The second covers all lines, lands,
structures and equipment and other property, interests or rights,
lgal or equitable, then owned by the Company, and not set forth
particularly. The fourth provides for the grant of additional security,
and the sixth covers legal and equitable rights, claims and demands,
and rents and income in the property subject to the lien of the
indenture.

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 493
448

Opinion of the Court.

It is stipulated that all the equipment subject to the
equipment trusts in question was acquired for use and was
used on all of the debtor's lines, including those specifically
described in the granting clauses. This would seem to
make clear that the debtor's equity in equipment trust
rolling stock is covered by the lien of the First Mortgage.
Subdivision (3) of the third, after-acquired property
clause, as well as the fifth granting clause, applies.
The refunding mortgage trustee relies, however, on a
clause found between the sixth granting clause and the
habendum, hereafter referred to as the reservation clause,
and reading:"
"'The portion of this clause preceding that quoted in the text
provides:
"But nothing express or implied in this indenture shall be construed
to limit the right or power of the Company or any successor or purchasing corporation, which right and power is hereby expressly reserved, by the use of its credit or free funds or by the use of First
Mortgage Bonds delivered to the Company or any successor or purchasing corporation as in this indenture provided to reimburse the
Company or any such successor or purchasing corporation
for expenditures theretofore actually made out of its free
funds, to construct or acquire free from the lien hereof lines
of railroad, extensions or branches or interests therein, equipment,
stocks, bonds or other securities or other property, rights, franchises,
immunities or privileges provided the same shall not be lines of railroad, extensions, or branches or interests therein, equipment, stocks,

"and the Company may, unless First Mortgage Bonds shall
have been authenticated and delivered or their proceeds or
other cash deposited hereunder paid out against the same,
purchase and acquire equipment, free from the lien hereof,
by lease, conditional sale agreement or under any form of
equipment trust, or purchase such equipment and issue
obligations therefor secured by mortgage or pledge of such
.equipment superior to the-lien of this indenture."
It is argued that this reservation permits the acquisition
of rolling stock entirely free from the lien of the First
Mortgage, unless acquired, as was not the case here, by the
use of proceeds of the first mortgage bonds. 2
for use in or for the maintenance or operation of or appertaining to
any of the lines of railroad, extensions, branches or other property

said The Salt Lake City Union Depot and Railroad Company or said
Standard Realty and Development Company or any subsidiary company or of any right, title or interest which the Company or any successor or purchasing corporation may acquire in or to any of the property of either of the companies above named or in or to any line of
railroad or other property of any corporation which shall then be or
immediately prior thereto shall have been a subsidiary company as the
term subsidiary company is defined in Section 2 of Article Second
hereof; . .."
2The trustee finds further support for this argument in a comparison of the four limitations on the acquisition of property from
free funds found in the opening portion of the reservation clause, quoted
in the preceding footnote, with the latter portion of the clause, quoted
in the text. The opening portion contains four limitations, of which
only two are relevant to this argument. The first of these four limitations is that the property may not be acquired by the use of first
mortgage bonds or their proceeds and the third relates to property
acquired for use in the operation of the road which is subject to the
mortgage. It is only this first limitation which is repeated in the
latter portion of the reservation clause. It is argued that the omission to repeat the limitation as to property acquired for use in the
operation of the road shows an intention that such a limitation should

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 495
448

Opinion of the Court.

We do not so view the reservation.

It rather performs

the function of authorizing the acquisition of equipment
by equipment trust or other method and only to that extent displacing the lien of the First Mortgage arising from
the after-acquired property clauses. The granting clauses
show a purpose to subject to the First Mortgage all the
not apply in that latter portion. From this it is said to follow that
property acquired for use in the operation of the road but not bought
with first mortgage moneys is not subject to the mortgage, i. e., that
the words "the Company may ...

purchase ...

equipment, free

from the lien hereof, by lease, conditional sale agreement or under any
form of equipment trust" should be read literally without regard to
the purpose of the clause taken together with the remainder of the
mortgage. Thus all but the conclusion of this argument is merely a
variation of the argument discussed and rejected in the text, that the
words "free from the lien hereof" are to be taken literally and that the
purpose of the latter portion of the reservation clause was to accomplish the result contended for by the refunding mortgage trustee.
If it be said that the words "free from the lien hereof" in the opening portion of the reservation clause have a different meaning from
that which we give those same words in the latter portion of the
clause, the answer must be that, in view of the different functions of
the two portions of the reservation clause, the difference is required.
The opening portion is entirely consistent with granting clause third
and the remainder of the reservation clause.
The four limitations in the opening portion of the reservation clause
substantially correspond to the four categories of after-acquired property which are subject to the mortgage under granting clause third.
By the third granting clause, after-acquired property in these four
categories is subject to the mortgage. By the opening portion of the
reservation clause, property not in these categories may be purchased
with free funds and will be free from the mortgage. This is so because
the categories, as defined in both places, do not comprehend property
unconnected with the road of the debtor. Thus the purchase with
free funds of a foreign railroad or of domestic real estate unconnected
with the road would be permissible under the opening portion of the
reservation clause, would not have been covered by the third or fifth
granting clauses and might conceivably be the subject of a supplemental
indenture under granting clause sixth. See n. 30, supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

property and equipment used in connection with the road.
There is repeated general mention of the grant of rolling
stock, of legal and equitable interests. The third and
fifth granting clauses fully cover this after-acquired equity
in rolling stock purchased through equipment trusts and
the "Subject, however" clause clearly contemplates that
the First Mortgage shall be a lien on equipment second
only to equipment trust agreements. That clause provides for the subordination of the First Mortgage to
equipment trust agreements to which after-acquired
equipment shall be subject "as permitted hereby." These
last words, a reference to the reservation clause, confirm
our view that the function of the reservation clause is
merely to permit the purchase of equipment by that
method and not to authorize the completely untrammeled
acquisition of such equipment.
It is urged that the words "free from the lien hereof"
in the reservation clause must be given their literal significance. The argument must fail aside from the difficulties inherent in a suggestion that these words shall be
lifted from context and forcibly applied without reference
to an intention fairly to be drawn from three specific
clauses of the mortgage and reinforced by the entire
scheme of the document. The reservation clause provides that the company may acquire equipment "free from
the lien hereof" if the method be by lease, conditional sale
or equipment trust but may "purchase such equipment
and issue obligations therefor secured by mortgage or
pledge of such equipment superior to the lien of this indenture." Why the difference? Equipment acquired for
cash would unquestionably become subject to the First
Mortgage. Equipment acquired under a purchase money
chattel mortgage would under this clause be subject to
the mortgage. The First Mortgage would merely be
junior to the chattel mortgage. Yet equipment acquired
under an equipment trust agreement is said to be entirely

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 497
448

Opinion of the Court.

free of the mortgage. The inconsistency 11 of such a result suggests that the phrases "free from the lien hereof"
and "superior to the lien of this indenture" are in a sense
correlative and were merely suited to the different title
situations in the two methods of financing.
B. The Northern California Extension is a 112 mile
branch of the debtor's main line and runs from Keddie,
California, to the Great Northern Railroad at Bieber,
California. It has been profitable since its construction
in 1932 and the Commission expects that its traffic will
increase. As has been stated the question as to the
extension is whether it is covered by the after-acquired
property clauses of the First Mortgage. Slightly less than
one-half the cost of the extension, or about $5,000,000, was
financed by the sale of first mortgage bonds; another
$5,000,000 was realized from the sale of unsecured debentures to the A. C. James Co., later replaced by collateral
notes secured by refunding mortgage bonds, and the remainder, approximately $500,000, was borrowed from the
R. F. C. on the security of refunding mortgage bonds."
38 No reason suggests itself as to why equipment acquired for cash
should have been intended to be covered by the First Mortgage and
equipment acquired by the equipment trust method not be subject
to the mortgage after the equipment trust obligation is completely
satisfied. Yet this is a consequence of the argument pressed upon us.
31 Construction of the extension was begun in August, 1930, and
by the end of December a substantial amount of the work had been
completed. Connection with the Great Northern was made on November 10, 1931, and freight service was then inaugurated under the
jurisdiction of the construction department. On June 1, 1932, the
line was placed in full operation. The cost of construction to May
31, 1932, was $10,183,641.90 and additional sums were later expended.
It was financed as follows: First mortgage bonds in the amount of
$5,000,000 were sold at 97 between February 11, 1931, and January
29, 1932, producing $4,875,000. Between February 27, 1931, and
May 31, 1932, $5,000,000 of debentures, issued under an indenture
dated July 1, 1930, were sold for cash at par to A. C. James Co.
These debentures were retired in March and May, 1932, through

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

In view of this, the refunding mortgage trustee contends
that the First Mortgage should as a matter of equity be
held a lien on the extension only to the extent of first mortgage moneys used or that it be held a first lien on a portion
of the mileage equal to the proportion that first mortgage
moneys bore to the total cost, or on an undivided interest
in the extension in the same proportion. But here again
the terms of the First Mortgage preclude such a contention. The third granting clause covers "any and all
property . . . including . . . extensions . . . if

"(a) acquired or constructed by the use of First Mortgage Bonds or proceeds thereof or cash deposited hereunder
(except bonds delivered or cash paid out under any of the
provisions of this indenture in reimbursement of previous
expenditures certified as hereinafter provided) or on account of the purchase, acquisition or construction thereof
or work thereon First Mortgage Bonds shall hereafter be
authenticated and delivered or the proceeds of First Mortgage Bonds or other cash deposited hereunder shall hereafter be paid out under any of the provisions of this
indenture;
The reservation clause supplements this by its provision
that the right to acquire property free of the lien shall not
extend to "lines of railroad, extensions or branches
... (a) on account of the purchase, acquisition or
construction whereof or work whereon First Mortgage
Bonds shall be authenticated and delivered or their prothe issue of notes to the A. C. James Co. for $4,999,800 ($200 being
paid in cash) secured by a pledge of $6,249,500 face amount of refunding mortgage bonds. The Refunding Mortgage was executed
and delivered February 29, 1932, as of January 1 of that year. The
remainder of the total cost of construction was financed by loans of
$559,408 procured from the R. F. C. in March, June and August, 1932.
These were parts of larger loans and were Fecured by refunding mortgage bonds.

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 499

Opinion of the Court.

ceeds or other cash deposited hereunder shall be paid
out as herein provided; . . ." See n. 31, supra.
The substantial nature of the financing of the extension
by the sale of first mortgage bonds is a matter of record
and we hold that the quoted portion of the third granting
clause and especially the clause beginning "or on account
of the purchase, acquisition or construction thereof or
work thereon" bring this extension within the coverage
of the First Mortgage. In opposition to this conclusion
it is said that it would permit the First Mortgage to
become a lien on the extension if only one penny of first
mortgage money had been used. That is, of course, not
our case. Here we have a considered plan for financing
an extension which contemplated that 50% of the necessary moneys be procured through the sale of first mortgage bonds. The terms of the after-acquired property
clause disclose an intention that where at least such part
of the funds used for the construction of such an extension are first mortgage funds that the entire extension
should be subjected to the lien of the mortgage. The
refunding mortgage trustee contends that it is inequitable
to give the first mortgage bondholders a lien to the extent
of all first mortgage bonds outstanding when in fact
those bondholders contributed only $5,000,000 to the cost
of construction and the refunding mortgage bondholders
contributed the remainder. The asserted inequity disappears on a reference to the record where it plainly appears that the parties concerned had no understanding
that the lien situation would be different from what we
have held it to be."5
85 The primary parties concerned were The Western Pacific Railroad
Corporation, purchaser of the $5,000,000 of first mortgage bonds in
question, and the A. C. James Co., purchaser of a like amount of debentures. The A. C. James Co. in 1929 offered to finance the cost of
the extension in return for a first lien thereon. It was then believed

C. Lastly, the refunding mortgage trustee makes a limited claim against certain "non-carrier" realty which is
alleged to be completely free of the lien of the First Mortgage. The refunding mortgage trustee believes that this
property should be given consideration as unmortgaged
property in the allocation of securities to the refunding
mortgage creditors.
that the cost of the extension would be approximately $5,000,000.
When it developed that it would greatly exceed that amount, t'he
A. C. James Co. withdrew this offer and substituted another offer
to advance 50% of the moneys needed, the advances not to exceed
$5,000,000. No mention was made in this second offer of a first lien
or, indeed, of any lien and the indenture under which the debentures
were issued was equally silent. The parties were fully aware that the
remaining 50% of the cost would be paid by the sale of first mortgage
bonds or other funds. The second offer, in the form of a commitment to bid at public sale, was accepted by the debtor.
The specifications referred to in the notice calling for bids on the
debentures contain the following:
"The main line of railroad of the Company extends from San Francisco, California, to Salt Lake City, Utah, with branches, and aggregates 1050.5 miles more or less of first track. Upon the completion
of the Company's 'Northern California Extension' its main line of
railroad will aggregate 1198.5 miles, more or less. A map of the
Company's railroad system is hereto annexed.
"The First Mortgage of this Company dated June 26, 1916, securing this Company's First Mortgage Bonds, whereunder not more than
$50,000,000 thereof may be outstanding at any one time, is a first
lien on said main line of railroad."
The bid of the A. C. James Co. stated that it was made in accordance with the specifications, which had been examined by the bidder.
The specifications in connection with the offers of the $5,000,000 of
first mortgage bonds contain similar statements:
"Said First Mortgage constitutes a first lien on the main line of
railroad of the Company extending from San Francisco, California,
to Salt Lake City, Utah, and branches, aggregating 1050.5 miles,
more or less, of first track, the Company's terminal and other railroad properties in the cities of San Francisco, Oakland and elsewhere,
and certain of its rolling stock and equipment. Upon the comple-

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 501

Opinion of the Court.

The greater part of this property, which was not used
for railway purposes, was acquired from the debtor's predecessor, the Western Pacific Railway Company, pursuant
to its reorganization in 1916, and the question is whether
this property is within the terms of the First Mortgage. 8
We answer this question affirmatively. Despite the fact
that it is or was not used for transportation purposes, the
mortgage nevertheless covers it by the conveyance of:
"First.-All and singular the following described lines
of railroad, terminals, lands, equipment, shares of stock
and other real and personal property and interests and
rights in property owned by the Company or to which it
may be entitled, formerly the property of or belonging to
tion of the construction and/or acquisition of the Company's 'Northern California Extension' its main line of railroad will aggregate
1198.5 miles, more or less. A map of the Company's railroad system
is hereto annexed."
The bids of The Western Pacific Railroad Corporation contain a
reference to the specifications similar to that in the bid of the A. C.
James Co.
Mr. A. C. James was during this time the president and a director
of the A. C. James Co., a director of the Western Pacific Railroad
Corporation and a director of the debtor.
It is not suggested that the understanding of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation as to the lien of the refunding mortgage bonds
pledged with it to secure the loans made to complete payment for
the extension was different. See Western Pac. R. Co. Reconstruction Loan, 180 I. C. C. 645, 646, 648-9, an exhibit herein.
86 A portion of this "non-carrier" property was acquired after 1916,
some of it by the use of first mortgage moneys and some of it in substitution for property released from the lien of the First Mortgage. The
refunding mortgage trustee makes no claim to the property acquired
by the use of first mortgage moneys. Another small portion of the
property was acquired after 1916 but without the use of first mortgage moneys, for use as future industrial sites and for gravel pit pur
poses. The claim to this last property is not specified in the briefs
of the refunding mortgage trustee and it seems to be of such negligible
value as would not warrant a reallocation of securities if it were to be
held that this property is not subject to the first mortgage lien.

by the District Court, directing that
"All collateral pledged by the debtor as security for notes

loans, the A. C. James Company furnished to the debtor a
block of refunding bonds, previously issued to A. C. James
Company by the debtor, and Western Pacific Corporation
furnished to the debtor other collateral described in the
Commission finding. These securities were a part of
those then pledged by the debtor to secure the notes held
by Railroad Credit Corporation and Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which knew the source of the collateral
at the time.
The debtor's objection to the Commission's order is
stated by it as follows:
"In substance, the Commission provided that the collateral owned and pledged by the Debtor should be surrendered to the reorganized Company but that the accommodation collateral borrowed from others and pledged
by the Debtor should be confiscated; or, to state the proposal somewhat differently, the accommodation collateral
is to be resorted to first instead of last as is required by the
most elemental principles of equity and by the authorities
cited below."
interest amounted to $649,181, the notes being secured by $10,750,000,
principal amount, of the debtor's general and refunding bonds, and
voting-trust certificates for half of the voting stock of the Denver &Rio
Grande Western Railroad Company, and a second lien upon $2,000,000,
principal amount, of the same issue of bonds held by the Railroad
Credit Corporation; class 5 items consisted of $2,445,610, face amount,
of notes to the Railroad Credit Corporation, on which accrued and
unpaid interest amounted to $135,296, which notes are secured by
$4,000,000, principal amount, of the debtor's general and refunding
bonds, and a second lien upon the security held by the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation, an assignment of certain advances by the Western
Pacific Railroad Corpolation, and an assignment of the distributive
share of the debtor under the marshaling and distributing plan,

Opinion of the Court.

We think, however, that the objection is not sound and
that the Commission's order is correct. These are our
reasons: The refunding bonds pledged by the debtor to
secure the A. C. James Company note and left in that
position throughout were pledged directly by the debtor
and are not accommodation collateral in any sense. Nor
do we need give consideration to the accommodation collateral behind the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
and Railroad Credit Corporation notes other than the refunding bonds. In the earlier order approving the plan,
the Commission provided that the rights of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Railroad Credit Cor-,
poration "in collateral pledged with them by parties other
than the debtor" should not be disturbed or altered. 230
I. C. C. 102; subdivision 0 of the order of October '10,
1938, id. 114. On consideration of the petitions for modification of this order, the Commission refused to direct
that this collateral be "surrendered to the pledgors
thereof." 233 I. C. C. 431, 432. In its order, however,
promulgating the present plan there is no clause comparable to subdivision 0 of the previous order preserving the
rights of Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Railroad Credit Corporation in the collateral pledged with
them by "parties other than the debtor." The sole provision in the final order as to the collateral behind the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Railroad Credit
Corporation is that found in subdivision R and quoted at
the opening of this section of this opinion, directing the
collateral pledged by the debtor with Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Railroad Credit Corporation and A. C.
James Company, be reduced to possession, surrendered to
the reorganized company and canceled. This was entirely proper. None of the collateral, other than the refunding bonds, was a claim against the debtor. A. C.
James Company and the Western Pacific Corporation

perhaps had unsecured claims against the debtor for their
securities and other collateral which the debtor had borrowed but these were held worthless as claims against the
debtor. 233 I. C. C. 452. This collateral, other than the
refunding bonds, was therefore left with the pledgees
with its position unaffected by any direct action of the
Commission.
The "collateral pledged by the debtor" referred to in
the excerpt from subdivision R of the Commission's final
order, 233 I. C. C. 453, quoted above, can be only the general and refunding bonds of the debtor, including those
previously furnished by A. C. James Company. The
words used in subdivision R to describe them are the same
used by the Commission in distinguishing the refunding
bonds from the remainder of the accommodation collateral. 233 I. C. C. 431, 432. Of course the collateral
loaned to the debtor which was not an obligation of the
debtor could not be ordered by the plan to be canceled.
It remained with the pledgees. This "collateral pledged
by the debtor" was properly to be reduced to possession
by the pledgees, surrendered and canceled. For these
bonds, furnished by A. C. James Company, held as collateral with other bonds of the debtor, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Railroad Credit Corporation received their allotment of new securities, 230 I. C. C.
101, as modified by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation arrangement, described in this opinion at page 485.
See 233 I. C. C. 414,452. The A. C. James Company unsecured claim against the debtor for the loan of the bonds
is valueless, 233 I. C. C. 452, and the plan does not deal
with any possible claim of accommodation pledgors
against pledgees of bonds which were not the property of
the debtor.
Change of Conditions. The plan now under consideration was certified to the court on September 28, 1939.
To provide for a $3 dividend on the no par stock, the plan

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 507

Opinion of the Court.

calls for future earnings available for betterments, interest, sinking fund and dividends of over $4,500,000. The
table on page 457 shows how difficult it had been for the
system to earn that amount. Anticipated earnings was
the principal factor governing the valuation of the property and the dollar volume of new securities, and past
earnings was an important factor in estimating future
earnings. A higher estimate of future earnings available
for dividends might have created an equity for unsecured
creditors or even stockholders. Furthermore, respondents
urge that the "earning power" of the property referred to
in subsection (e) means not only realized earnings but the
system's ability, utilizing its present facilities to the full,
to earn increased returns. This we deem of little weight
against the history of past operations. Respondents ask
us to take into consideration the changed conditions since
the Commission acted. There are a few years of actual
experience subsequent to the certification. By stipulation of the parties reports of operating results, combined,
have been filed for our consideration for the period beginning December 1938 down to and including July 1942.
Since we have agreement among the parties as to the earnings available for interest, as adjusted, through 1939, see
page 457, supra, we need refer only to subsequent periods.
These reports show the following sums available for interest: 1940-$2,513,090; 1941-$4,548,128; 1942 (7
months) $4,830, 986,* less relatively minor deductions
which have not been consistently treated in the reports.
This last group of figures is utilized by us as a rough extension of the table of earnings on page 457. They are
useful to show the striking increases over the old averages
but have not been adjusted to conform mathematically
with the table of earlier years.
*We have been furnished statements of operating results of the
debtor through November, 1942, which show for that part of the
year income available for fixed charges of $10,309,517.18.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

318 U. S.

In the interest of advancing the solution of as many
problems in reorganization as possible, we have deliberated upon the effect to be given these unexpectedly large
earnings. There are factors in these increased incomes
which obviously affect their weight as evidence of continued capacity to produce earnings available for dividends. The effect of taxation is not wholly answered by
deductions of tax estimates on the basis of present rates.
The reduction by the plan of outstanding interest-bearing
securities makes income taxes more likely to affect net
earnings. Increased wages and costs must be reckoned
with and increased maintenance may reasonably be expected from increased use. Already serious proposals for
decrease of tariffs have been advanced. Order of the
Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex parte No. 148,
January 4, 1943.
Respondents, of course, admit that the needs of war
have increased traffic. Transcontinental transportation
has at the moment displaced a large proportion of that
from coast to coast, via the Panama Canal. Buses and
trucks have yielded much of their gains in volume to railroads. But respondents point to the Northern California
Extension and the Dotsero Cutoff as permanent feeders
to the debtor's growing business. They see a post-war
reconstruction and rehabilitation period which promises
a continuance of heavy railway use into the indefinite
future. This, say respondents, is to be appraised in the
light of the necessity for a national transportation system
adequate for the productive capacity of the war facilities,
when they are turned to peaceful pursuits.
The Commission, at the time of its certification to the
court, September 28, 1939, acted as the results of increased
business were just emerging into increased profits. 8 In

objections to the Commission plan filed in the court on
December 8, 1939, it was suggested that "any estimate of
railroad earnings made prior to the development of war
conditions must be revised." The court after considering
all of the objections offered, but without specifically discussing the changed conditions, approved the plan on
August 15, 1940. 34 F. Supp. 493, 504. The Commission's forecast was made with knowledge and not in disregard of past fluctuations of income, in war and in peace.
On the showing as to changed conditions made before the
District Court, there was no basis for a disapproval of
the Commission plan as unfair to the junior equities.
The further evidence of increased earnings, placed in the
record by the stipulations, does not lead us to reject the
Commission's plan.
Effective Date of Plan. January 1, 1939, was chosen as
the effective date of the plan. The debtor objects to this
on the ground that subsection (1) fixes the date of filing
the petition as the date for the plan. 9 The practical
result of the debtor's argument is to make the interest
as the result of the war and, in the report, stated fully all considerations leading to its conclusions as to justifiable amounts of capitalization and of new general-mortgage bonds. Under present conditions,
the fact that the year 1942 gives promise of producing even larger

earnings than 1941 affords too uncertain and precarious a basis to
justify the increases sought."

rate of the new securities applicable from August 2, 1935,
instead of from January 1, 1939. As the new securities
bear lower interest rates than the contract securities, a
savings to the estate would accrue."0 But we are of the
opinion that the provisions of subsection (b) are sufficiently broad to empower the Commission to select the
date for the institution of the reorganization. Cf. Group
of InstitutionalInvestors v. Chicago,M., St. P. & P. R. Co.,

Costs. The Institutional Bondholders Committee in
No. 7 and the Trustees of the First Mortgage in No. 8
call our attention to the provision in the decree in the Circuit Court of Appeals for costs against appellees there
and suggest that costs should be assessed directly against
the estate of the debtor in proceedings under § 77. Our
reversal of the decree leaves the appellees below free of
this provision of the decree and requires us to assess costs
on the review. We see also no reason why costs should
not be assessed against the losing parties on this review of
the action of the District Court, and it will be so ordered.
This assessment is without prejudice to a motion for allowance for disbursements by respondents in accordance
with subsection (c) (12)."
Other minor objections to the plan as approved by the
District Court are advanced but we do not consider them
as of sufficient weight to require comment.
From the foregoing it follows that the judgment of the
Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and that of
the District Court affirmed.
Reversed.

agrees with this opinion,

barring only the views expressed regarding the respective functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the district judge under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON

and

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE

took

no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I am in agreement with much that is said in the opinion,
but I desire separately to state my views as to the respective roles assigned to the Interstate Commerce Commission and to the District Court in the reorganization
process.
Section 77 was adopted in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution upon Congress to establish
uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout
the United States. The proceeding is, from its initiation, one in bankruptcy. The legislation constitutes the
Interstate Commerce Commission an arm of the court
and clothes the Commission with certain functions as
such. No question is made as to the authority of Congress thus to divide responsibilities between the court and
the Commission in the formulation of a plan of reorganization. Section 77 is the guide to decision concerning
the respective duties of the court and the Commission.
The statutory provisions quoted in Note 7 of the majority
opinion seem to me clearly to define the boundaries of
the powers conferred.
Certain requisites and certain permissible features of
the plan, for the formulation of which the Commission
has sole responsibility, are prescribed or permitted.
Within very broad limits the Commission is given discretion in the application of these in formulating a plan.
(Subsection (b).) When the plan is certified to the judge
his function is, as the Court holds, merely to see that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.

318 U. S.

limits set in subsection (b) are not transgressed; that the
Commission has observed the standards and limits thereby
set. See subsection (e) which directs that the judge
shall approve the plan if satisfied that it complies with
the provisions of subsection (b).
Other functions are reposed solely in the Commission.
It is to determine whether the plan "will be compatible
with the public interest." (Subsection (d).) I need
not discuss the purport of this direction, which obviously
relates, in the main, to the proposed corporate and capital
structure of the reorganized company. That structure
must be such that the rehabilitated enterprise may have
a reasonable prospect of satisfactory public service. The
statute will be searched in vain for any mandate to the
court to review or overturn the Commission's judgment in
this respect; and I agree that the District Court properly
held that the protection of the public interest was so far
committed to the Commission that, except for the most
egregious disregard of relevant considerations, the judge
should hold himself bound by the Commission's appraisal
of the demands of that interest.
Another vital step in formulating any plan is committed
to the judgment of the Commission. This is valuation
of property. Subsection (e) states that, if it shall be
necessary to determine the value of any property for any
purpose under the Act, the Commission shall determine
such value and certify the same to the court in its report.
It seems clear, as the opinion states, that the court cannot
reject the plan for any mere asserted error in valuation.
Its power is limited to an examination of the question
whether the Commission acted wholly without evidence,
arbitrarily, or in disregard of recognized criteria."
II believe this is so as to the valuation of all the assets and as to
valuations of property subject to liens or available for the claims of
classes of creditors or stockholders. See subsection (e), par. 2.

ECKER v. WESTERN PACIFIC R. CORP. 513
448

ROBERTS,

J., concurring.

In equity reorganizations prior to the passage of § 77
the phrase "fair and equitable" had come to have a recognized content. It meant that, in allotting interests in
the reorganized company, the priorities existing between
lienors and stockholders of the debtor must be substantially preserved. No reorganization could be fair and
equitable if, in the new capital structure, junior interests
were allowed to participate at the expense of those who
had had a senior position in the old.2
Section 77 sought to preserve and enforce this rule
of law. By subsection (d) the Commission is charged
with seeing that a proposed plan meets the requirements
of subsection (e) and, by subsection (e) it is provided
that, on certification of a plan to the court, all parties may
file detailed and specific objections to the plan and their
claims for equitable treatment. The judge is to hold a
hearing on such objections "and such claims for equitable
treatment." Thus the statute provides for the framing
in court of sharp and specific issues directed to the plan's
compliance with the rule governing allocation, and this
fact is emphasized by the leave granted the parties to produce in court additional evidence. After the direction
that the judge shall approve the plan "if satisfied" it complies with subsection (b), (which involves only a determination, as above indicated, whether the Commission,
in setting up the plan, has respected the limits set by Congress in subsection (b)), subsection (e) goes on to deal
with the judge's action on the objections of the parties and
their claims for equitable treatment. It provides that
he must be satisfied that the plan "is fair and equitable,
affords due recognition to the rights of each class of creditors and stockholders, does not discriminate unfairly in

favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, and will
conform to the requirements of the law of the land regarding the participation of the various classes of creditors and
stockholders."
I read this language as placing upon the court a duty
quite distinct from any imposed upon it in connection with
the general features of the plan or in connection with any
findings of the Commission with respect to the value of
property. The statute contemplates that the judge shall
not only examine the findings of the Commission with
respect to the fair equivalent of what is granted to mortgagees or stockholders compared to the interest in the old
company that they are to surrender, and the Commission's
reasons for its action, but also hear evidence by which he
may be more fully informed as to the equity and fairness,
as those terms have specific legal connotation, of rights
accorded under the plan in relation to those theretofore
enjoyed. In my view, Congress intended that the judge
should satisfy himself, as in the old equity proceedings
he was bound to do, that the relation between the various
classes of investors is substantially maintained in the
reorganization.
In order to discharge this judicial duty the court obviously may have to pass upon questions of law. In the
present case, a decision as to the priority and extent of the
respective mortgage liens is a legal prerequisite to an adjudication of the issue whether different classes of mortgage bondholders received fair and equitable treatment
in the apportionment of new securities. I agree with the
conclusions of the court on the question of law thus presented. It happens that the parties in interest do not
challenge the fairness of the allocation as between them,
if the Commission was right in its tentative conclusion
concerning the coverage of the first mortgage and that
of the general and refunding mortgage. In this case,
then, the function of the court was fully performed once

Syllabus.

it had decided that question of law. In other cases, where
the issue of fairness and equity depends upon the facts
disclosed, I think it is the duty of the court to go farther
and examine the plan sufficiently to satisfy itself that
the rule of absolute priority announced in the Boyd case
and in the Los Angeles and Rock Products cases has not
been violated. In performing this duty the court should
accord great weight to the Commission's action. It should
require the objector to show that the Commission has
failed to respect the doctrine. But it should not accord
finality to the Commission's action if there be any evidence to support it. I believe the court is charged by
subsection (e) with the duty of determining that, in the
allocation of securities in the reorganized company, the
Commission has a substantial foundation in the facts for
the allocation of securities required by the plan it
approves.
I concur in the judgment of the Court.
