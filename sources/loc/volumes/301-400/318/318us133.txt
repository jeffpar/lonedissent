FISH AND GAME COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 60. Argued November 10, 1942.-Decided February 8, 1943.
L Forfeiture by procedure in rem of a net which, while being used by
a fishing vessel in navigable coastal waters of a State, had been seized
for violation of a law of the State forbidding fishing by net in those
-waters, is "a common law remedy" which "the common law is competent to give," within the statutory exception to the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty conferred on district courts of the United States
by § 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and the State may provide for
such forfeiture in a proceeding in a state court. Pp. 134, 153.
2. The common law, as received in this country at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution, gave a remedy in rem in cases of
forfeiture. P. 153.

OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE

318 U. S.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The Fish and Game Commission of California, having
seized a purse net while it was being used for fishing in
the navigable waters of the state in violation of the State
Fish and Game Code, brought the present proceeding
under § 845 of the Code for forfeiture of the net. The
question for decision is whether the state court's judgment, directing that the net be forfeited and ordering
the commission to sell or destroy it, is a "common law
remedy" which the "common law is competent to give"
within the statutory exception to the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty conferred on district courts of the United
States by § 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 76-77,
28 U. S. C. §§ 41 (3) and 371 (Third).
Section 845 of the California Fish and Game Code
declares that a net used in violation of the provisions
of the Code is a public nuisance and makes it the duty of
any arresting officer to seize the net and report its seizure
to the commission. The statute requires the commission
to institute proceedings in the state superior court for
the forfeiture of the seized net and authorizes the court,
after a hearing and determination that the net was used
unlawfully, to make an order forfeiting it and directing
that it be sold or destroyed by the commission.
In this case the commission seized the net while it
was being used by the fishing vessel Reliance in navigable coastal waters of the state in violation of §§ 89 and
842, which prohibit fishing by net in the area in question,
and respondents, the members of the commission, brought
this proceeding in the state superior court for the forfeiture of the net. Petitioners appeared as claimants
and after a trial the court gave judgment that the net
be forfeited, ordering respondents to sell or destroy it.
The Supreme Court of California at first set the judgment aside, but after rehearing affirmed, 18 Cal. 2d 835,

C. J. HENDRY CO. v. MOORE.
133

Opinion of the Court.

118 P. 2d 1, holding that the remedy given by the judgment is a "common law remedy" which "the common
law is competent to give," and that the case is not within
the exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty conferred on the
federal courts by the Judiciary Act and hence was properly tried in the state court. Cf. Knapp, Stout & Co. v.
McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638; The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398,
404; Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109,
123. We granted certiorari, 316 U. S. 643, the question
being of importance in defining the jurisdiction of state
courts in relation to the admiralty jurisdiction.
Only a single issue is presented by the record and
briefs--whether the state is precluded by the Constitution and laws of the United States from entertaining the
present suit. It is not questioned that the state has authority to regulate fishing in its navigable waters, Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240; Lawton v. Steele,
152 U. S. 133, 139; Lee v. New Jersey, 207 U. S. 67; Skiriotes v. Florida,313 U. S. 69, 75; and it is not denied that
seizure there of a net appurtenant to a fishing vessel is
cognizable in admiralty. But petitioners insist that the
present proceeding is not one which can be entertained by
a state court since the judgment in rem for forfeiture of the
net is not a common law remedy which the common law is
competent to give, and that the case is therefore not within
the statutory exception to the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts. In this posture of the case,
and in the view we take, we find it necessary to consider
only this contention.
Section 371 (Third) of 28 U. S. C., derived from § 9 of
the Judiciary Act of 1789, confers exclusive jurisdiction on
the federal courts "of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the right of
a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it . . ." A characteristic feature of the maritime law is its use of the procedure in rem derived from
513236-43-vol. 318-13

318 U. S.

the civil law, by which a libellant may proceed against
the vessel, naming her as a defendant and seeking a judgment subjecting the vessel, and hence the interests of all
persons in her, to the satisfaction of the asserted claim.
Suits in rem against a vessel in cases of maritime tort and
for the enforcement of maritime liens are familiar examples of a procedure by which a judgment in rem is
sought, "good against all the world."
The question whether a maritime cause of action can
be prosecuted in the state courts by such a procedure was
first discussed by this Court seventy-seven years after the
adoption of the Constitution and the Judiciary Act, in
The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, which held that a lien
upon a vessel, created by state statute, could not be enforced by a proceeding in rem in the state courts. Decision was rested on the ground that exclusive jurisdiction
of the suit was vested in the federal courts by the Judiciary
Act, since a judgment in rem to enforce a lien is not a remedy which the common law is competent to give, a ruling
which has since been consistently followed. The Hine v.
Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624; The Glide,
167 U. S. 606; The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 36-38;
Rounds v. CloverportFoundry Co., 237 U. S. 303, 307-08.
Eleven years earlier this Court in Smith v. Maryland, 18
How. 71, without discussion of the point now at issue, had
sustained the seizure and forfeiture of a vessel in a state
court proceeding in rem, all pursuant to state statutes,
for violation of a Maryland fishing law within the navigable waters of the state. The Court declared that the
statute, which prescribed the procedure in rem in the
state court, conflicted "neither with the admiralty jurisdiction of any court of the United States conferred by
Congress, nor with any law of Congress whatever" (p. 76).
The authority of that decision has never been questioned
by this Court.

C. J. HENDRY CO. v. MOORE.
133

Opinion of the Court.

The common law as it was received in the United States
at the time of the adoption of the Constitution did not
afford a remedy in rem in suits between private persons.
Hence the adoption of the saving clause in the Judiciary
Act, as this Court has held in the cases already cited, did
not withdraw from the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty
that class of cases in which private suitors sought to enforce their claims by the seizure of a vessel in proceedings
in rem. But to the generalization that a judgment in rem
was not a common law remedy there is an important exception. Forfeiture to the Crown of the offending object,
because it had been used in violation of law, by a procedure in rem was a practice familiar not only to the English admiralty courts but to the court of Exchequer. The
Exchequer gave such a remedy for the forfeiture of
articles seized on land for the violation of law. And, concurrently with the admiralty, it entertained true proceedings in rem for the forfeiture of vessels for violations
on navigable waters.' Such suits in the Exchequer were
begun on information and were against the vessel or
article to .be condemned. Under the provisions of many
statutes the suit might be brought by an informer qui tam,
who was permitted to share in the proceeds of the for1 We

are not concerned here with the question whether the admi-

ralty jurisdiction was fully concurrent with that of the Exchequer even

in the case of seizures on navigable waters. During the historic struggle
between the admiralty and the common law courts, the latter sought,
with varying success, to restrict the admiralty jurisdiction to the high
seas and to exclude it from harbors, estuaries, and other arms of the
sea. See Justice Story's elaborate discussion in DeLovio v. Boit, 2 Gall.

feited article; the judgment was of forfeiture and the forfeited article was ordered to be sold. This was the established procedure certainly as early as the latter part of the
seventeenth century.' Proceedings in rem, closely paralleling those in the Exchequer, were also entertained by
justices of the peace in many forfeiture cases arising under
the customs laws (see Hoon, The Organization of the English Customs System, 1696-1786, pp. 277, 280-83), and the
Act of 8 Geo. I, c. 18, § 16, placed within that jurisdiction
the condemnation of vessels up to fifteen tons charged
with smuggling.

numerous other forfeiture statutes conferred jurisdiction

to be recovered "in any of His Majesty's courts in Newfoundland, or
in any court of record in England or Wales."
The Navigation Acts commonly provided that a forfeiture proceeding might be brought, in addition to others, "in any court of record,"
e. g., 12 Car. II, c. 18, §§ 1, 3, 6, 18, or "in any of his Majesty's Courts
of Record at Westminster," 8 Geo. I, c. 18, § 23; 6 Geo. II, c. 13, § 4.

tain suits for forfeiture, nevertheless suitors having ready
access to the convenient procedure of exchequer or admiralty in qui tam actions seem to have had little occasion
to resort to the King's Bench or Common Pleas. In the
occasional reported forfeiture cases brought in King's
Bench, the English reports give us little light on the procedure followed or the precise form of judgment entered.
In one case, Roberts v. Withered, 5 Mod. 193, 12 Mod. 92,
the court seems to have adapted the common law action
of detinue to forfeiture cases by resort to the fiction that
bringing the action was the equivalent of a seizure which
vested the property in the Crown so that a suit in detinue
or replevin in personam to gain possession would lie. See
Stephen, Pleading (3rd Am. ed.) pp. 47, 52, 69, 74; Ames,
Lectures on Legal History, pp. 64, 71. Cf. Wilkins v.
Despard,5 Term Rep. 112.
Separate courts exercising the jurisdiction of the Court
of Exchequer were never established in the American
Colonies. Instead, that jurisdiction was absorbed by the
common law courts which entertained suits for the forfeiture of property under English or local statutes authorizing its condemnation. Long before the adoption of the
Constitution the common law courts in the Colonies-and
later in the states during the period of Confederationwere exercising jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of
forfeiture statutes. Like the Exchequer, in cases of
seizure on navigable waters they exercised a jurisdiction
concurrently with the courts of admiralty. But the viceadmiralty courts in the Colonies did not begin to function
with any real continuity until about 1700 or shortly afterralty ... or . .. any Court of Record" in the American Colonies

The

important Act of 1696 (7 & 8 Win. III, c. 22, § 2) provided that forfeitures of ships and goods might be enforced "in any of his Majesty's
courts of record at Westminster, or in any court in his Majesty's plantations, where such offence shall be committed."

The English Navigation Laws, ch. 15; Osgood, The American Colonies in the 18th Century, vol. 1, pp. 185-222,
299-303. By that time, the jurisdiction of common law
courts to condemn ships and cargoes for violation of the
Navigation Acts had been firmly established, apparently
without question, and was regularly exercised throughout
the colonies. In general the suits were brought against
the vessel or article to be condemned, were tried by jury,
closely followed the procedure in Exchequer, and if successful resulted in judgments of forfeiture or condemnation with a provision for sale.'
4 VIRGINIA: In the 1670s forfeitures under the Navigation Acts were
declared by the Council. See Minutes of the Council and General
Court of Colonial Virginia, 1622-1632 and 1670-1676 (ed. McIlwaine,
1924), pp. 212, 214, 216, 242-44, 445-46. But by the 1690s such
cases were tried at common law in the General Court before a jury.
Although the records of the General Court were destroyed by fire
during the evacuation of Richmond in 1865, copies of some of its
more important proceedings during the 1690s, contemporaneously
transmitted to England, have been preserved, and are reprinted in
Executive Journals of the Council of Colonial Virginia (ed. McIlwaine,
1925), vol. I. See the cases of The Anne & Catherine, pp. 173-75;
The William & Mary, pp. 241-43; The Content, pp. 379-80; Cole v.
Three Pipes of Brandy, pp. 204-05; cf. The Crane, pp. 233-34, 300;

controlled by the obstinate resistance of American juries-did not divest the colonial common law courts of their

MARYLAND: A commission for a special court of admiralty to try
forfeiture cases under the Navigation Acts for a limited period of time
is to be found as early as 1684, 17 Archives of Maryland 360-62, (cf.
20 id. 72, 75, 165), some admiralty jurisdiction having previously been
exercised by the Provincial Court, 49 Archives xv, xxi-xxiii. But forfeiture cases were tried generally at courts of oyer and terminer, acting
with a jury. See Andrews, Vice-Admiralty Courts in the Colonies,
supra, p. 8, n. 2; 57 Archives lvii; Morriss, Colonial Trade of Maryland 1689-1715, pp. 121-22; case of The John, 1687, 8 Archives 9;

Margaret, 1692, 8 id. 489-91, and again in 1694, 20 id. 42-43, 65, 142,
184. The Ann of Maryland was acquitted at a special court of oyer
and terminer in 1694; she was tried before the Provincial Court later
the same year and acquitted by the jury; the judgment was reversed
on appeal in May 1695; upon a second trial in the Provincial Court
on a new information the jury again acquitted her in August 1695,
but the proceedings on the second appeal are incomplete. Proceedings of the Maryland Court of Appeals 1695-1729 (ed. Bond, 1933),

(p. 40). Compare The Charles,1696, 23 Archives 3.

in this respect the judicial history of forfeiture proceedings in New York, manuscript records of which we have
examined, is not typical of the others, and there is ample
support for the conclusion that in the seaboard states forfeiture proceedings in rem, extending to seizures on navigable waters of the state, were an established procedure
of the common law courts before the Revolution. It was
the admiralty courts, not the common law courts, which
had difficulty in establishing their jurisdiction, although
in 1759 the Board of Trade was able to write that "With
regard to breaches of the Law of Trade they are cognizable
either in the courts of common law in the plantations, or
in the courts of Admiralty, which have in such cases, if
not in all, a concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of common law" (quoted in Andrews, Vice-Admiralty Courts in
the Colonies, supra,at p. 7); and Stokes reported that the
same situation prevailed at the outbreak of the Revolution. See Stokes, A View of the Constitution of the British
Colonies (1783), pp. 270, 357 et seq.
In New York, admiralty jurisdiction was vested in the

The Navigation Acts did not constitute the only authority for forfeiture proceedings in the common law
courts. New York's own colonial legislation shows frequent use of the forfeiture sanction, applied sometimes
to vessels as well as to commodities, as a means of enforcement of provincial laws fixing customs duties, regulating
or prohibiting the exportation or importation of commodities, or requiring a specified manner of marking, storing
or selling.7 A common provision in these statutes was
that the forfeitures imposed might be prosecuted in any
court of record in the colony.
The records of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature contain numerous instances of forfeiture proceedings during the eighteenth century. One is Hammond

In 1739 the Supreme Court of Judicature issued a writ of prohibition
restraining prosecution of a forfeiture proceeding under 15 Car. II, c. 7,
against The Mary and Margaret in the court of vice-admiralty. Four
years later the Privy Council upheld the issuance of the writ, apparently
accepting the view that a seizure in any part of New York harbor
which was "within the body of the county" rather than on the high
seas came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the common law courtsa ruling which probably left to the vice-admiralty court but a small role
in cases under the Navigation Acts, except when the particular Act

false customs certificate, which resulted in the discharge
of the ship and her cargo for failure of proof. Later cases
show more in detail how closely that court's procedure
in forfeiture cases followed the essentials of the procedure
in rem which had been developed in the English Exchequer.' Nor did the creation of a state Court of Admiralty after the Revolution effect a withdrawal of such
jurisdiction from the common law courts. Statutes enacted in New York during the period of the Confederation,
like the English and local legislation which preceded
them, continued to employ forfeiture as a sanction, 0 and
contained an express grant of such jurisdiction (cf. Note 3, supra).

had in mind when in § 9 they used the phrase "common
law remedy." But it is unlikely that, in selecting this
phrase as the means of marking the boundary of the jurisdiction of state courts over matters which might otherwise be within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty,
the draftsmen of § 9 intended to withdraw from the state
courts a jurisdiction and remedy in forfeiture cases which
had been so generally applied by non-admiralty courts
both in England and America, and which had become a
recognized part of the common law system as developed
in England and received in this country long before the
American Revolution. Nor can we accept the suggestion that Congress, in this use of the phrase "common
law remedy," was harking back some hundreds of years
to a period before the Exchequer had taken its place as
one of the three great courts administering the common
law, and was likewise disregarding the experience of the
common law courts in America with which it was familiar-all without any indication of such a purpose. Considerations of practical convenience in the conduct of
forfeiture proceedings for violations 'of local statutes occurring on state waters, as well as the contemporary and
later history of the exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction,
indicate that there was no purpose to limit such proceedings to the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty.
Shortly after the adoption of the Constitution, state
legislation was enacted regulating state tidal waters and
authorizing forfeiture in the state courts of fish nets and
vessels illegally used in fishing there. Such a statute was

371, Fed. Cas. No. 3230, (cited in Smith v. Maryland,
supra, 18 How: at 75), where a New Jersey state court forfeiture of a vessel under a statute regulating the Delaware
Bay was upheld as constitutional by Justice Washington,

of the in rem nature of the proceeding. No suggestion

is to be found in that case or elsewhere that the Judiciary
Act struck down the large body of state legislation, enacted
shortly after 1789, which provided for the forfeiture in
state courts of vessels or nets seized in navigable waters
of a state for violating state fishing laws. 5 And such legislation has become rooted in the law enforcement programs

Kean v. Rice, 12 Sea rg. & Rawl. 203), had been condemned under
§§ 6 and 7 of the New Jersey Act of June 9, 1820, whose forfeiture
provisions were derived from §§ 5 and 6 of the Act of January 26,
1798 (Paterson, New Jersey Laws 1703-1799, p. 263), in turn derived
from §§ 2-6 of a Provincial Act of 1719, 5 Geo. I, c. 30 (Nevill, New
Jersey Acts 1703-1752, pp. 86-88). Compare the forfeiture provisions

waters, including Taunton Great River and the Merrimack, and providing that any nets used unlawfully should be forfeited. Act of February

of the peace); Act of March 27, 1793.
Delaware regulated the taking of oysters and other shellfish by the
Act of February 12, 1812 (see Revised Laws, 1829, p. 274), imposed as
a penalty the forfeiture of vessels and their equipment, and by § 2 provided that the condemnation proceeding should be before two justices

in any waters in the state, the vessel together with all its implements
should be forfeited in an action qui tam in the court of common pleas

of Exchequer as the procedure by which forfeitures were
inflicted for violation of Acts of Parliament. Bk. III, p.
262. And Kent, in his Commentaries, pointed out that
"seizures, in England, for violation of the laws of revenue,
trade or navigation, were tried by a jury in the Court of
Exchequer, according to the course of the common law;
and though a proceeding be in rem, it is not necessarily a
proceeding or cause in the admiralty" (12th ed., Vol. 1,
p. 374). He declared that, within the meaning of § 9 of
the Judiciary Act, the common law was competent to give
such a remedy "because, under the vigorous system of the
English law, such prosecutions in rem are in the Exchequer, according to the course of the common law"
(p. 376).
Upon the" adoption of the Constitution the national
government took over the regulation of trade, navigation
and customs duties which had been prolific sources of forfeiture proceedings in the state courts. This Court in
suits brought in admiralty sustained the admiralty jurisdiction over forfeitures prescribed by Congress for the
violation of federal revenue and other laws where the seizure had occurred on navigable waters. United States v.
La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297; United States v. Schooner
Sally, 2 Cranch 406; United States v. Schooner Betsey and
Charlotte, 4 Cranch 443; Whelan v. United States, 7
Cranch 112; The Samuel, 1 Wheat. 9. Those decisions
held that when .the seizure occurred on navigable waters
the cause was maritime and hence triable without a jury
in the federal courts. 17 But they obviously did not determine, and there was no occasion to determine, whether
forfeiture proceedings belonged in the category of maritime causes that might also be tried in state courts be17 Section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 77, provided that "the
trial of issues in fact, in the district courts, in all causes except civil
causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury."

C. J. HENDRY CO. v. MOORE.

Opinion of the Court.

cause, within the meaning of the saving clause, the common law was competent to give the remedy.
The Court has never held or said that the admiralty
jurisdiction in a forfeiture case is exclusive, and it has repeatedly declared that, in cases of forfeiture of articles
seized on land for violation of federal statutes, the district
courts proceed as courts of common law according to the
course of the Exchequer on informations in rem with trial
by jury. The Sarah, 8 Wheat. 391, 396, n. A; 443 Cans of
Egg Product v. United States, 226 U. S. 172, and cases
cited. In United States v. 422 Casks of Wine, 1 Pet. 547,
Justice Sto defined such an action as a libel or information in rem on the Exchequer side of the court. And see
Chief Justice Marshall's reference, in Schooner Hoppet v.
United States, 7 Cranch 389, 393, to "proceedings in
Courts of common law, either against the person or the
thing, for penalties or forfeitures." In all this we perceive a common understanding of judges, lawyers and text
writers, both before and after the adoption of the Constitution, of the common law nature of the procedure and
judgment in rem in forfeiture cases and of its use in such
proceedings in the Exchequer and in the American common law courts.
We conclude that the common law as received in this
country at the time of the adoption of the Constitution
gave a remedy in rem in cases of forfeiture, and that it is a
''common law remedy" and one which "the common law is
competent to give" within the meaning of § 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. By that Act the states were left free
to provide such a remedy in forfeiture cases where the
articles are seized upon navigable waters of the state for
violation of state law. It follows that Smith v. Maryland,
supra, was rightly decided and is not in conflict with The
Moses Taylor, supra, and cases following it, and that the
judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be
Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE

318 U. S.

BLACK, dissenting:

If this case involved only a fishnet, I should be inclined to acquiesce in the holding of the Court. Indeed,
we have held that a state may seize and condemn a fishnet
of trifling value without following the formal procedure
of court action at all. Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133.
But the principle laid down here involves far more than a
fishnet, for under it state courts are authorized through
in rem proceedings to seize and condemn, for violation of
local law, any equipment or vessel employed in maritime
activity. Today's in rem action is against a fishnet used
in patently illegal fashion; tomorrow's may be an action
against a tramp-steamer or ocean liner which violates a
harbor regulation or otherwise offends against the police
regulations of a state or municipality. Persons guilty of
violating state laws affecting maritime activity may be
prosecuted by in personam actions in state courts,' and
the admiralty courts themselves can helpfully enforce
state laws through in rem proceedings.2 I do not believe,
however, that the Judiciary Act permits states, through
state common law courts which cannot reasonably be expected to have knowledge of admiralty law and practice,
to give permanent halt to any portion of the maritime
trade and commerce of the nation by bringing in rem

It is particularly important in time of war, when every vessel is in
constant use, that in rem proceedings be strictly controlled. This is
partially done by the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, for a brief

BLAcx, J., dissenting.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 places in the federal admiralty courts exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty cases
except where the common law provides an equivalent
remedy. It is conceded that as a general proposition the
common law courts have no in rem remedy in maritime
cases. However, the Court holds squarely, for the first
time in its history, that there is an exception to this rule
which permits states to bring in rem forfeiture proceedings in common law courts. The Court brushes aside
as mere generalizations the many cases hereafter considered which declare that no equivalent of an admiralty
in rem proceeding may be brought at common law.
Today's holding is rested principally on the English
and colonial practice prior to 1789 and on one case in this
Court. I disagree, believing that the English practice is
irrelevant, that the colonial law was not in accord with
the English practice, and that a long series of cases since
1789 have clearly considered the proposition put by the
Court, and have given the Judiciary Act a meaning squarely opposite to that now announced.
The English Exchequer practice on which the Court
appears to rely so heavily seems to me to be irrelevant
because it was not in conformity with our own early American development. The colonists, of course, did not establish admiralty courts the moment they stepped from the
vessels which brought them to the New World, and for
a substantial portion of the seventeenth century maritime
forfeitures were collected in the fashion of the English
courts. However, toward the end of that century, it became acutely apparent in England that colonial juries
would not enforce the navigation laws as England desired
to see them enforced. This was particularly true in Massachusetts Bay' and in other colonies where commercial

interests dominated. Hence in 1697, Vice Commissioners
of Admiralty were established throughout the colonies to
enforce the navigation laws of England without jury procedure. It was conceded by the earliest writers that the
Vice Admiralty courts in the colonies "obtained in a singular manner a jurisdiction in revenue causes, totally
foreign to the original jurisdiction of the admiralty, and
unknown to it." ' Yet, with the great adaptability of the
early courts, this jurisdiction in the colonies was fitted
into the judicial system so as to allow appeal, as in purely
admiralty cases, to the High Court of Admiralty in England. The Vrouw Dorothea (1754) reported in The Fabius, 2 C. Robinson 246.6

The same conflict which took place in England between
Coke as champion of the common law jurisdiction, and
the admiralty courts also was carried on in the colonies.
Cf. Talbot v. The Three Brigs, 1 Dall. 95. As a result there
was, throughout the eighteenth century, marked confusion
as to the proper jurisdiction of each in forfeiture cases.
For example, in 1702, the Board of Trade asked the advice
of the Attorney General as to whether all forfeitures in
connection with colonial trading matters under the Navigation Act of 1696 were to be prosecuted exclusively in
courts of admiralty, and the Attorney General replied in
the affirmative.' On the other hand it is clear, as the cases
and having a governor and magistrates of their own choice, it was very

difficult to enforce any regulations which came from the English parliament, and were adverse to their colonial interests." Reeves, The
Law of Shipping, 56 (1807).

cited by the Court show, that this view was not always
maintained. One can only conclude that there was in
1789 no completely clear resolution of the conflict between
admiralty and common law courts in forfeiture cases,
though the cases hereafter considered indicate that the
admiralty courts were winning the dominant role. At the
same time it must be conceded by the proponents of the.
Court's view that American practice had come to be
markedly different from the English.
It is settled beyond question that the general admiralty
law of the United States in 1789 was the law as developed
in the colonies and not the law as it came from England.
Prior to the middle of the nineteenth century a contrary
view was often pressed upon the Court and was as often
rejected with adequate reference to the differences between the two.' The early American courts therefore
were faced with the task of determining whether forfeiture actions should be brought exclusively in the common law courts, exclusively in the admiralty courts, or
concurrently in either. In repeated decisions relating to
forfeitures under federal laws, this Court, within a few
years of the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1789, held
that forfeiture jurisdiction was exclusively in the admiralty courts.
The leading case for this proposition is La Vengeance,
3 Dall. 297 (1796). In that case the United States brought
an action of forfeiture for exporting arms and ammunition. The United States contended in this Court that the
action was criminal in its nature and that, in any case, it
was not a-civil suit within the admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction and therefore should have been tried before
a jury as at common law. The Court held that the action
was clearly civil since it was an in rem proceeding and that

it was subject to the maritime jurisdiction because the
basic transportation activity involved was "entirely a
water transaction." There is no suggestion whatever, in
the brief opinion of the Court, of the possibility of a concurrent common law jurisdiction. This rule was followed
in The Sally, 2 Cranch 406, where the government again
contended that it was entitled to try forfeiture actions
before a jury since the "cause was of common law, and
not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," and the same
result was reached in The Samuel, 1 Wheat. 9."
One of the most elaborate arguments ever made in this
Court on the issue now before us was presented in 1808
in United States v. Schooner Betsey and Charlotte, 4
Cranch 443. That case arose on an action for forfeiture.
Counsel for the claimant, who had also been the losing
counsel in La Vengeance, contended that the action should
have been tried as at common law. He strongly emphasized the Exchequer practice in England and said,
"There is nothing in the course of proceedings in rem
which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty." Id. 447. The argument he made was almost
identical with that which the Court adopts in the instant
case. He emphasized particularly that "We have seen
that in all cases of seizure for breaches of the law of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent
to give a remedy; and consequently this suitor is entitled
to it." Id. 449.
The Court rejected entirely the argument of the counsel,
held The Betsey and Charlotte indistinguishable from La
Vengeance, and interpreted the Judiciary Act to mean that
Congress had placed forfeitures "among the civil causes of
9In The Samuel, the claimant contended that since the action was
begun by an information rather than a libel, the case was not subject
to the admiralty jurisdiction. The Court held that "Where the cause
is of admiralty jurisdiction, and the proceeding is by information, the
suit is not withdrawn, by the nature of the remedy, from the jurisdiction

to which it otherwise belongs." p. 14.

admiralty and maritime jurisdiction." La Vengeance was
held conclusive of the proposition that in such cases there
could be no right to trial by jury-in other words that
under the American law as repeatedly declared between
1796 and 1808, the common law was not, within the meaning of the Judiciary Act, competent to give a remedy in
forfeiture cases. 10 When the question of a right to a common law trial in a forfeiture case was certified to the Supreme Court in 1812, the Court found it unnecessary to
hear any argument and counsel became so convinced that
the authorities were conclusive that he did not press the
case.2
These cases were reviewed many times in this Court and
elsewhere, and cited for the proposition that in the United
States, in noteworthy distinction from England, the admiralty forfeiture jurisdiction was exclusive. 2 This cul20 Justice Chase in the course of argument commented from the
bench that he thought La Vengeance a well considered case. His comment leaves no doubt that he considered the admiralty jurisdiction for
forfeiture exclusive: "The reason of the legislature for putting seizures
of .this kind on the admiralty side of the court was the great danger
to the revenue, if such cases should be left to the caprice of juries."

of the Sally, that the forfeiture of a vessel, under the Act of Congress
against the slave-trade, was a case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and not of common law. And so it had done before, in the case
of La Vengeance." Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 458. "All the cases
thus arising under the revenue and navigation laws were held to be
civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction within the words
of the Constitution, and, as such, were properly assigned to the District
Court, in the Act of 1789, as part of its admiralty jurisdiction." New

opinion in Jackson v. The Magnolia, 20 How. 296, 309. It is worthy
of note that this opinion by Mr. Justice Daniel makes an argument
very similar to that now made by the Court and relies as does the

minated in a holding in 1868, The Eagle, 8 Wall. 15, 25,

26, that the words in the 1789 Act giving admiralty jurisdiction in forfeiture cases were superfluous and of no effect
since "the general jurisdiction in admiralty exists without regard to it."
Against the background of these cases we may consider
Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, which the Court cites for
the existence of the forfeiture exception to the general rule
as to exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of in rem proceedings. In that case the power of the state to protect a fishery by making it unlawful to catch oysters in a certain
manner and to inflict a penalty of forfeiture upon a vessel
employed in violation of the law was upheld. The entire
argument was directed at considerations foreign to the
issue of this case and the Judiciary Act was not even mentioned; the opinion of the Court deals almost exclusively
with the question of whether the state statute was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution. The
Court held in passing that the mere existence of federal
admiralty jurisdiction does not per se bar the state from
legislating for the protection of its fisheries, a proposition
which no one can doubt. It is apparent that the issue now
before us, interpretation of the Judiciary Act, was not presented to the Court nor decided by it in the Smith case.

If Smith v. Maryland accidentally interpreted the Judiciary Act, it did so in a manner in conflict not only with all
the cases decided before it in which the issue was squarely
considered but with the great number of cases decided
since. In The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 431 (1866), our
leading case, the Court declared that "a proceeding in
rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not a remedy
afforded by the common law." The considerations of policy which underlay this interpretation of the Judiciary Act
were attributed to Justice Story: "'The admiralty jurisdiction,' says Mr. Justice Story, 'naturally connects itself,
on the one hand, with our diplomatic relations and the
duties to foreign nations and their subjects; and, on the
other hand, with the great interests of navigation and commerce, foreign and domestic. There is, then, a peculiar
wisdom in giving to the national government a jurisdiction
of this sort which cannot be yielded, except for the general
good, and which multiplies the securities for the public
peace abroad, and gives to commerce and navigation the
most encouraging support at home.'" The Moses Taylor,
supra, 430-431.
The language of The Moses Taylor has been repeated
so often that I should have thought it to be a truism of
the law. In The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644: "There is no
form of action at common law which, when compared with
the proceeding in rem in the admiralty, can be regarded
as a concurrent remedy." In Rounds v. Cloverport
Foundry Co., 237 U. S. 303, 306: "The proceeding in
rem . . . is within the exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty." In Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638,
648: "The true distinction between such proceedings as
are and such as are not invasions of the exclusive admiralty
jurisdiction is this: If the cause of action be one cognizable
in admiralty, and the suit be in rem against the thing itself . . . the proceeding is essentially one in admiralty."

In Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109, 124:
"A State may not provide a remedy in rem for any cause
of action within the admiralty jurisdiction." ',
Cases prior to Smith v. Maryland explicitly held that
forfeitures were not to be enforced by an in rem action at
common law. Cases since Smith v. Marylandhave repeatedly declared that admiralty's in rem jurisdiction is exclusive of state court action. I therefore see no reason for
placing any reliance on the Smith case which only consequentially affected an issue to which it gave no consideration at all; and for purposes of settling a jurisdictional
issue such as this, the English practice, which need give
no consideration to the complexities of dual sovereignty
and diverse state laws, seems peculiarly inapplicable. By
permitting maritime suits against persons in state courts
and by denying the state courts jurisdiction of suits against
vessels, the right to trial by jury is adequately preserved
at the same time that the policy of ultimate exclusive
national regulation of ships in commerce is saved.
