FISHER v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 122.

Argued December 5, 1945.-Decided June 10, 1946.

1. In a trial in the District of Columbia for murder in the first degree,
as defined in D. C. Code, 1940, Title 22, § 2401, which makes deliberation and premeditation essential elements of the crime, it was
not error for the court to refuse to instruct the jury that they should
consider evidence of the defendant's mental deficiency, concededly
not amounting to legal insanity, to determine whether he was guilty
of murder in the first or second degree. Pp. 464, 470, 473.
2. This Court may notice material error in the instructions in a criminal case even though the error is not specifically challenged; and
the. Court should do so when life is at stake, even in cases from the
District of Columbia. Pp. 467, 468.
3. Matters relating to law enforcement in the District of Columbia
being entrusted to the courts of the District, the policy of this Court
is not to interfere with the local rules of law which they fashion,
save in exceptional situations where egregious error has been committed. P. 476.
80 U. S. App. D. C. 96, 149 F. 2d 28, affirmed.

Petitioner was convicted of murder in the first degree
and sentenced to death. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed. 80 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
This writ of certiorari brings here for review the sentence of death imposed upon petitioner by the District
Court of the United States for the District of Columbia
after a verdict of guilty on the first count of an indictment
which charged petitioner with killing by choking and
strangling Catherine Cooper Reardon, with deliberate and
premeditated malice. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the judgment
and sentence of the District Court. 80 U. S. App. D. C.
96, 149 F. 2d 28.
The errors presented by the petition for certiorari and
urged at our bar were, in substance, that the trial court
refused to instruct the jurors that they should consider
the evidence of the accused's psychopathic aggressive

tendencies, low emotional response and borderline mental
deficiency to determine whether he was guilty of murder in
the first or in the second degree. The aggregate-of these
factors admittedly was not enough to support a finding
of not guilty by reason of insanity.1 Deliberation and
I The Code of Law for the District of Columbia (1940 Ed.) provides as follows:
Title 22, § 2401, "Whoever, being of sound memory and discretion,
kills another purposely, either of deliberate and premeditated malice
or by means of poison, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate
any offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, or without
purpose so to do kills another in perpetrating or in attempting to
perpetrate any arson, as defined in section 22-401 or 22-402 of this
Code, rape, mayhem, robbery, or kidnapping, or in perpetrating or
in attempting to perpetrate any housebreaking while armed with or
using a dangerous'weapon, is guilty of murder in the first degree."
Title 22, § 2403, "Whoever with malice aforethought, -except as
provided in sections 22-2401, 22-2402, kills another, is guilty of murder
in the second degree."
Title 22, § 2404, "The punishment of murder in the first degree
shall be death by electrocution. The punishment of murder in the
second degree shall be imprisonment -for life, or for not less than
twenty years."

Opinion of the Court.

premeditation are necessary elements of first degree
murder.
Cornsiderations as to the exercise of authority by this
Court over the courts of the District of Columbia in the
interpretation of local criminal statutes induced us to
grant the writ in view of the issue presented. Judicial
Code, § 240 (a).
The homicide took place in the library building on the
grounds of the Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul,
Washington, D. C., between eight and nine o'clock, a. m.,
on March 1, 1944. The victim was the librarian. She
had complained to the verger a few days before about
petitioner's care of the premises. The petitioner was the
janitor. The verger had told him of the complaint. Miss
Reardon and Fisher were alone in the library at the time
of the homicide. The petitioner testified that Miss Reardon was killed by him immediately following insulting
words from her over his care of the premises. After slapping her impulsively, petitioner ran up a flight of steps
to reach an exit on a higher level but turned back down,
after seizing a convenient stick of firewood, to stop her
screaming. He struck her with the stick and when it
broke choked her to silence. He then dragged her to a
lavatory and left the body to clean up some spots of blood
on the floor outside. While Fisher was doing this cleaning up, the victim "started hollering again." Fisher then
took out his knife and stuck her in the throat. She was
silent. After that he dragged her body down into an adjoining pump pit, where it was found the next morning.
The above facts made up petitioner'sstory to the jury of
the killing.
It may or may not have been accepted as a whole by
the jury. Other evidence furnishes facts which may: have
led the jury to.disbelieve some of the details of accused's
version of the tragbdy. In his original confession, the

328 U. S.

accused made no reference to Miss Reardon's use of
insulting words. In his written confession, they were
mentioned. In his testimony their effect upon him was
amplified. There are minor variations between Fisher's
written confession and his testimony. In the written confession Fisher admitted that his main reason for assaulting
Miss Reardon was because she reported him for not cleaning the library floor. Tie Deputy Coroner said the knife
wound was not deep, "just went through the skin."
The effort of the defense is to show that the murder was
not deliberate and premeditated; that it was not first but
second degree murder. A reading of petitioner's own testimony, summarized above, shows clearly to us that there
was sufficient evidence to support a verdict of murder in
the first degree, if petitioner was a normal man in his
mental and emotional characteristics. Cf. Bostic v. United
States, 68 App. D. C. 167, 94 F. 2d 636, 638. But the defense takes the position that the petitioner is fairly entitled
to.be judged as to deliberation and premeditation, not by
a thebretical normality but by his own personal traits.
In view of the status of the defense of partial responsibility in the District and the nation no contention is or
could be made of the denial of due process. It is the contention of the defense that the mental and emotional qualities of petitioner were of such a level at the time of the
crime that he was incapable of deliberation and premeditation although he was then sane in the usual legal sense.
He knew right from wrong. See M'Naghten's Case, 10
Cl. & Fin. 200, 210. His will was capable of controlling
his impulses. Smith v. United States, 59 App. D. C. 144,
36 F. 2d 548. Testimony of psychiatrists to support petitioner's contention was introduced. Ap instruction charging the jury to consider the personality of the petitioner
in determining intent, premeditation and deliberation was
sought and refused,

FISHER v. UNITED STATES.
463

Opinion of the Court.

From the evidence of the psychiatrists for the defense,
the jury might have concluded the petitioner was mentally
somewhat below the average with minor stigmata of mental subnormalcy. An expert testified that he was a psychopathic personality 2 of a predominantly aggressive
type. There was evidence that petitioner was unable by
reason of a deranged mental condition to resist the impulse to kill Miss Reardon. All evidence offered by the
defense was accepted by the trial court. The prosecution
had competent evidence that petitioner was capable
of understanding the nature and quality of his acts.
Instructions in the usual form were given by the court
submitting to the jury the issues of insanity, irresistible
impulse, malice, deliberation and premeditation. Under
these instructions, set out below, the jury could have determined from the evidence that the homicide was not
the result of premeditation and deliberation.3
Although no objection as to the form of these instructions is urged here by counsel for petitioner, this Court in
a criminal case may notice material error within its power
2

"The only conclusion that seems warrantable is that, at some

time or other and by some reputable authority, the term psychopathic
personality has been used to designate every conceivable type of

abnormal character." Curran and Mallinson, Psychopathic Personality (1944), 90 J. Ment. Sci. 278.
3These instructions were given:
Insanity. "In behalf of the defendant, it is contended that he was'
insane, and therefore not legally responsible, hence should be acquitted
by reason of insanity.
"It is further contended that even if sane and responsible, there
was no deliberate intent to kill, nor in fact any actual intent to kill.
Therefore if not guilty by reason of insanity, the defendant at most
is guilty only of second degree murder or manslaughter, according
as you may find he acted with or without malice.
"Insanity, according to the criminal law, is a disease or defect of the
mind which renders one incapable to understand the nature and quality of his act, to know that it is wrong, to refrain from doing the

to correct, even though that error is not specifically challenged, and certainly should do so, even in cases from the
District of Columbia, where life is at stake. Brasfield v.
United States, 272 U. S. 448; compare Rules 54(a) (1),
59, 52 (b), Rules of Criminal Procedure. It is suggested
wrongful act. There must be actual disease or defect of the mental
faculties, so far impairing the reason or will that this test of sanity
cannot be met, before one is relieved of his criminal act.
"The fatal actions must be traceable back to a diseased or deranged
mentality."
Irresistible impulse. "Here it is contended that although the defendant may have understood what he was doing when he assaulted
Miss Reardon, and may have known it was wrong, yet he was impelled
by an irresistible impulse to do the violetit acts which caused her
death.
"If the defendant was suffering from a diseased condition of his
mental faculties, which so far destroyed his will, the governing power
of the mind, that his actions were not subject to the will, but beyond
its control, then in legal contemplation, he was insane and not responsible, though he may have understood the nature of those acts, and
have been conscious of their wrong.
"If, as I have said, there was such lack of willpower and control
it must have been the result of a disease or disorder of the mental
faculties. Mere loss of moral restraints leading to a surrender to
criminal thoughts and passions is not enough."
Malice; Deliberation; Premeditation. "I have stated that the
indictment presents within its terms the three degrees of unlawful
homicide-murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree,
and manslaughter.
"1 shall explain them in that order.
"Murder in the first degree is the killing of a human being purposely
and with deliberate and premeditated malice. The crime involves
these elements:
"First, the fatal act purposely done. Of that, nothing more need
be said.
"Second, malice.
"Third, premeditation.
"Fourth, deliberation.
"All these are' elements which go to constitute the crime of murder

Opinion 'of the Court.

by a dissent that these instructions, just quoted in note 3,
did not bring "sharply and vividly to the jury's mind" the
issue of premeditation; that they "consisted of threadbare
generalities, a jumble of empty abstractions." We think
the contention advanced is that the district judge should
in the first degree. Therefore, each and all must be established by
the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt..
"Malice is a basic element of murder in both the first and the second
degrees.
"In common parlance, the word signifies feelings of anger, hatred, or
illwill. Such feelings, may, of course, actuate the killing of a human
being, and often do.
"However, the law has given to the term 'malice' a special meaning.
It is the intentional doing of a wrongful act to the injury of another
under circumstances which do not legally justify or palliate the act.
"As applied to the crime of murder, malice is the intentional striking
of a deadly blow in execution of an evil purpose springing from a
heart regardless of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.
"Then, there is the element of premeditation. That is, giving
thought, before acting, to the idea of taking a human life and reaching
a definite decision to kill. In short, premeditation is the formation
of a specific intent to kill.
"Deliberation, that term of which you have heard much in the
arguments and one of the elements of murder in the first degree,
is consideration and reflection upon the preconceived design to kill;
turning it over in the mind; giving it second thought.
"Although formation of a design to kill may be instantaneous, as
quick as thought itself, the mental process of deliberating upon such
a design does require that an appreciable time elapse between formation of the design and the fatal act within which there is, in fact,
deliberation.
"The law prescribes no particular period of time. It necessarily
varies according to the peculiar circumstances of each case. Consideration of a matter may continue over a prolonged period-hours,
days, or even longer. Then again, itmay cover but a brief span of
minutes. If one forming an intent to kill does not act instantly, but
pauses and actually gives second thought and consideration to the
intended act, he has, in fact deliberated. It is the fact of deliberation
that is important, rather than the length of time it may have
continued."

Opinion of the Court.

have specifically referred to the words of insult or have
elaborated upon the details of the evidence in his charge
with respect to premeditation. With such a requirement
for instructions we do not agree. The evidence furnishes
the factual basis for a jury's conclusion as to guilt and its
degree, guided by the instructions of the court as to the
law.' Premeditation and deliberation were defined carefully by the instructions. The contention of the accused
that there was no deliberation or premeditation was called
distinctly to the jury's attention. The necessary time
element was emphasized and the jury wasftold that premeditation required a preconceived design to kill, a "second thought." With the evidence and the law before
them the jury reached its verdict. The instructions, we
think, were clear, definite, understandable and applicable
to the facts developed by the testimony. We see no error
in them.
The error claimed by the petitioner is limited to the
refusal of one instruction. The jury might not have
reached the result it did if the theory of partial responsibility' for his acts which the petitioner urges had been
submitted. Petitioner sought an instruction from the
trial court which would permit the jury to weigh the evidence of his mental deficiencies, which were short of insanity in the legal sense, in determining the fact of and the
accused's capacity for premeditation and deliberation. °

"The jury is instructed that in considering the question of intent
or lack of intent to kill on the part of the defendant, the question
of premeditation or no premeditation, deliberation or no deliberation, whether or not the defendant at the time of the fatal acts

Opinion of the Court.

The appellate court approved the refusal upon the alternate ground that an accused is not entitled to an instruc-

tion upon petitioner's theory.7 This has long been the
law of the District of Columbia.! This is made abundantly clear by United States v. Lee, 4 Mackey 489, 495.
This also was a murder case in which there was evidence
of mental defects which did not amount to insanity. An
instruction was asked and denied in the language copied

in the margin.9
was of sound memory and discretion, it should consider the entire
personality of the defendant, his mental, nervous, emotional and
physical characteristics as developed by the evidence in the
case."
Our conclusion does not require that we pass upon whether the
instruction was correct if petitioner's theory is sound, or whether if
incorrect, the judge should have recast the instruction in proper form.
See the case below, 80 U. S. App. D. C. 96, 97, 149 F. 2d 28, 29 r. c.
Compare Freihagev. United States, 56 F. 2d 127, 133, with George v.

29 1.c.
The Court of Appeals spoke of an acquittal under the proposed
instruction. The other language of the opinion and the refusal of the
petition for rehearing, which pointed out the misuse of the word, shows
clearly that a reduction in degree was meant, not an acquittal.

The instruction requested was: "If the jury are not satisfied from
the evidence that the defendant, at the time he committed the act, was
so mentally unsound as to render him incapable of judging between
right and wrong; yet if the jury find from the evidence that there was
such a degree of mental unsoundness existing at the time of the homicide as to render the defendant incapable of premeditation and of
forming such an intent as the jury believe the circumstances of this
case would reasonably impute to a man of sound mind, they may consider such degree of mental unsoundness in determining the question
whether the act was murder or manslaughter."

It is suggested that the Lee case was decided when
murder under the District law was not divided into degrees and that therefore it was not proper to instruct as
to the accused's mental capacity to premeditate and deliberate while now it would be. We do not agree. The
separation of the crime of murder into the present two
degrees by the Code of Law for the District of Columbia,
March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1189, 1321, is not significant in
analyzing the necessity for the proposed submission of
the evidence concerning petitioner's mental. and emotional characteristics to the jury by specific instruction.
The reason for the change, doubtless, lay in the wide range
of atrocity with which the crime of murder might be committed so that Congress deemed it desirable to establish
grades of punishment., Cf. Davis v. Utah Territory, 151
U. S. 262, 267, 270. Homicide, at common law, the rules
of which were applicable in the District of Columbia, had
degrees. Murder was "with malice aforethought, either
express or implied." Blackstone, Book IV (Lewis ed.,
insanity not sufficient to acquit the party of the crime of manslaughter
and yet sufficient to acquit him of the crime of murder.
"The law does not recognize any such distinction as that in the forms
of insanity. The rule of law is very plain that in order that the plea
of insanity shall prevail, there must have been that mental condition
of the party which disabled him from distinguishing between right and
wrong in respect of the act committed.
"Now if the prisoner was so far capable of distinguishing between
right and wrong as to be guilty of the crime of manslaughter, he surely
was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong in respect of
the crime of murder of the identical party. There can be no recognition of the doctrine that a man is incapable of distinguishing between
right and wrong so as to determine that the case-is not a case of murder, and yet capable of distinguishing between right and wrong so as to
be guilty of manslaughter. There is no such doctrine, and nothing
in the books that favors any such idea. The prayer therefore is
unsound in all respects, and even if it had been sound, not being
supported by evidence, the court below was entirely justified in
rejecting it."

1902), p. 195; see Hill v. United States, 22 App. D. C.
395, 401; Hamilton v. United States, 26 App. D. C. 382,
386-91; Burge v. UnitedStates, 26 App. D. C. 524, 527-30.
Manslaughter was unlawful homicide without malice.
Blackstone, Book IV (Lewis ed., 1902), p. 191. As capacity of a defendant to have malice would depend upon the
same kind of evidence and instruction which is urged
here,10 it cannot properly be said that the separation .of
murder into degrees introduced a new situation into the
law of the District of Columbia." As shown by the action
of the District of Columbia courts in this case and the
other District cases cited in this and the preceding paragraph, we think it is the established law in the District
that an accused in a criminal trial is not entitled to an
instruction based upon evidence of mental weakness, short
of legal insanity, which would reduce his crime from first
to second degree murder.
Petitioner urges forcefully that mental deficiency which
does not show legal irresponsibility should be declared
by this Court to be a relevant factor in determining
whether an accused is guilty of murder in the first or
second degree, upon which an instruction should be given,
as requested. It is pointed out that the courts of certain
states have adopted this theory. Others have rejected
it. 2 It is urged, also, that since evidence of intoxication

State v. Eaton, 154 S. W. 2d 767 (Mo.).
11The reference to the establishment of degrees of murder in Hopt
v. People, 104 U; S. 631, 634, may indicate a different point of view.
The .Court was there considering intoxication under a statutory requirement that the intoxication should be taken into consideration
by the jury in determining the degree of the offense.

cases. Those accepting the petitioner's theory are: Andersen v. State,

and premeditated malice could be convicted of the first
degree. It may be that psychiatry has now reached a
position of certainty in its diagnosis and prognosis which
will induce Congress to enact the rule of responsibility
for crime for which petitioner contends. For this Court
to force the District of Columbia to adopt such a requirement for criminal trials would involve a fundamental
change in the common law theory of responsibility..
We express no opinion upon whe.ther the theory for

subject for the exercise of legislative power or at least
for the discretion of the courts of the District. The
administration of criminal law in matters not affected by
constitutional limitations or a general federal law is a
matter peculiarly of local concern. Compare McNabb v.

322 U. S. 143, 156. This Court has in a less important
matter undertaken to adjust by decision an outmoded
rule of the common law to modern conditions. But when
that step was taken, it was declared that "experience has
clearly demonstrated the fallacy or unwisdom of the old
rule." Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371, 381. See

A shocking crime puts law to its severest test. Law
triumphs over natural impulses aroused by such a crime
only if guilt be ascertained by due regard for those indispensable safeguards which our civilization has evolved for
the ascertainment of guilt. It is not enough that a trial
goes through the forms of law. Especially where life is
at stake it is requisite that the trial judge should so guide
the jury that the jurors may be equipped to determine
whether death should be the penalty for conduct. Of
course society must protect itself. But surely it is not
self-protection for society to take life without the most
careful observance of its own safeguards against the misuse
of capital punishment.
This case has been much beclouded by laymen's ventures into psychiatry. We are not now called upon to
decide whether the antiquated tests set down more than
a hundred years ago regarding mental responsibility for
crime' are still controlling or whether courts should choose
from among the conflicting proposals of scientific specialM'Naghten's Case, 10 C1. & Fin. 200 (1843). More than sixty

ists2 This is not the occasion to decide whether the only
alternative is between law which reflects the most advanced scientific tests and law remaining a leaden-footed
laggard. The case turns on a much simpler and wholly
conventional issue. . For the real question, as I see it, is
whether in view of the act of Congress defining murder
in the first degree for prosecutions in the District and in
light of the particular circumstances of this case, the trial
court properly sent the case to the jury. That is a very
different question from whether the court's charge was
unimpeachable as an abstract statement of law. For
Fisher is not the name of a theoretical problem. We are
not hear dealing with an abstract man who killed an
abstract woman under abstract circumstances and received
an abstract trial on abstract issues. Murder cases are apt
to be peculiarly individualized, and this case has its own
distinctive features. It is in the light of these that we
must decide whether Fisher's death sentence should
legally stand.

may review the facts in a capital case.' Were such the

scope of our review of death sentences, I should think it
would be hard to escape what follows as the most persuasive reading of the record.
Fisher hadlearned from his boss of Miss Reardon's complaint about the slackness of his work. On the fatal
morning, Miss Reardon told Fisher that he was not doing
the work for which he was being paid, and in the course
of her scolding called him a "black nigger." This made
him angry-no white person, he claimed, had ever called
him that-and he struck her. She ran screaming towards
the window in the back of the room. Fisher ran out of
the room and up the stairs. Her screaming continued.
At the top of the stairs he saw a pile of wood lying by the
fireplace. He seized a piece of wood, ran down the stairs
and struck her on the head. The stick broke and he
seized her by the throat. She continued to scream until
she went limp. He then dragged her to the lavatory and
left her there while he went back to clean up the spots of
blood. She recovered sufficiently to scream again, and he
returned to the lavatory and cut her slightly with a knife
he carried in his pocket. The importance of the screaming is a key to the tragedy. It is difficult to disbelieve
Fisher's account that he never wanted to kill Miss Reardon
but wanted only to stop her screaming, which unnerved
him.
"She ran out from behind her desk, down toward
the back, screaming."
substance this [denial of the right to consider the facts by the appellate court] means that there is no review of the discretion of the
single judge. Thus a matter of life or death, once treated [in Massachusetts] with the utmost care, even beyond the requirements of
the law, has now been committed to a single judge of the Superior
Court, with no review whatever on its most vital aspects. Such a
situation places an unfair responsibility upon the trial judge and
upon the governor, is a potential threat to justice and is not reassuring to the public who have a right to demand that judicial consideration should be exhausted before a man is condeined to death."

The evidence in its entirety hardly provides a basis for
a finding of premeditation. He struck Miss Reardon
when she called him "black nigger." He kept on when
her screaming frightened him. He did not know he had
killed her. There is not the slightest basis for finding a
motive for the killing prior to her use of the offensive
phrase. Fisher, to be -sure, had Miss Reardon's ring in

dragging her, and he put it away when he reached home
to conceal its possession from his wife. He did not run
away and he cleaned up the blood "because [he] didn't
want to leave the library dirty, leave awful spots on the
floor. [He] wanted to clean them up." He treated the
spots on the floor not as evidence of crime but as part of
his job to keep the library clean-' Fisher was curiously
unconnected with the deed, unaware of what he had done.
His was a very low grade mentality, unable to realize the
direction of his action and its meaning. His whole behavior seems that of a man of primitive emotions reacting
to the sudden stimulus of insult and proceeding from that
point without purpose or design. Premeditation implies
purpose and purpose is excluded by instantaneous actiori.
Fisher's response was an instinctive response to provocation, and premeditation means nothing unless it precludes
the notion of an instinctive and uncalculated reaction to
stimulus. Accordingly, if existing practice authorized us
to review the facts in a capital case I should be compelled
to find that the ingredients of murder in the first degree
were here lacking. I would have to find that the necessary premeditation and deliberation for the infliction of a
death sentence were wanting, as did the New York Court
of Appeals in a case of singularly striking similarity.

If, under adequate instructions, it could have so found,
the homicide falls outside the requirements for a finding
of murder in the first degree. Congress in 1901 enacted
a code for the District in which it joined the growing movement of dividing murder into degrees.' Congress confined the death sentence to killing by premeditation; it
required designed homicide, previous deliberation that life
was to be taken, before the United States would take life

on the conscience of mankind.

See Calvert, CapitalPun-

ishment in the Twentieth Century (5th ed., 1936); Report
from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on

Capital Punishment, and Minutes of Evidence (1930).
The crime of murder was divided into two classes, in some
the result of a Code prepared by Judge Cox and enacted in 1901.
31 Stat. 1189, 1321. In an historical note that precedes the Code,
Judge Cox stated that it was to have been based on the laws of Maryland. District of Columbia Code (1940 ed.) xiv. In a letter to
the Washington Board of Trade, however, Judge Cox stated that the
Code was based on the laws of Maryland, Virginia, New York, and
Ohio. Report of the Washington Board of Trade, November 14,1898,
pp. 23-24. And the Washington Law Reporter, vol. 26, p. 801, states
that ,the "portions of the work relating to crimes and punishments
follcr the statutes of New York in creating degrees in the crime of
murder." A comparison of the Code with the New Vork Penal Code
of 1898, §§ 183, 183a, 184, bears out this statement, though the exact
language of the New York statute was not adopted.
The reports of each of the four States, however, up to the time
of the enactment of the District Code, indicates unanimity in one
essential element. For a homicide to constitute murder in the first
degree, the jury must find in addition to the element of intent to
kill, premeditation and deliberation. E. g., Spencer v. State, 69 Md.
28 (1888); Leighton v. People, 88 N. Y. 117 (1882); People v.
Majone, 91 N. Y. 211 (1883); People v. Conroy, 97 N. Y. 62 (1884);

States very early," in recognition of the fact that capital
punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder
is the result of premeditation and deliberation. It is this
consideration that has led most of the States to divide
common law murder into two crimes, and Congress followed this legislation. See Michael and Wechsler, A Rationale of the Law of Homicide (1937) 37 Col. L. Rev. 701,
703-704; Michael and Wechsler, Criminal Law and Its

The bite of law is in its enforcement. This is especially
true when careful or indifferent judicial administration
has consequences so profound as does the application of
legislation dividing murder into first and second degreesconsequences that literally make the difference between
life and death. This places the guiding responsibility
upon the trial court in no wise restricted by the course
pursued by the defense. The,preoccupation at the trial,
in the treatment of the conviction by the court below and
by the arguments at the bar of this Court, was with alluring problems of psychiatry. Throughout this melancholy
affair the insistence was on claims of Fisher's mental deficiencies and the law's duty to take into consideration the
skeptical views of modern psychiatry regarding the historic legal tests for insanity. I cannot but believe that
this has diverted attention from the more obvious and
conventional but controlling inquiry regarding the ab7 Pennsylvania enacted this type of legislation in, 1794. Pennsylvania Laws, 1794, c. 257,. §§ 1-2. This early statute has served as

That the charge requested by the defendant and denied
did not go to this issue of premeditation unambiguously
but in an awkward and oblique way did not lessen the
responsibility of the trial judge to bring this issue-it was
the crucial issue-sharply and vividly to the jury's mind.
If their minds had been so focused, the jury might well
have found that the successive steps that culminated in
Miss Reardon's death could not properly be judged in isolation. They might well have found a sequence of events
that constituted a single, unbroken response to a provocation in which no forethought, no reflection whatever, entered. A deed may be gruesome and not be premeditated.
Concededly there was no motive for the killing prior to
the inciting "you black nigger." The tone in which these
words were uttered evidently pulled the trigger of Fisher's
emotions, and under adequate instructions the jury might
have. found that' what these words conveyed to Fisher's
ears unhinged his self-control. While there may well

return a verdict of murder in the first degree unless satisfied that the defendant, at the time he committed the
offense, was capable of entertaining the malicious intent,
we cannot, in a case of this kind, speculate as to what considerations entered into their verdict." Sabens v. United
States, 40 App. D. C. 440, 444. The same guiding consideration for reviewing a death sentence was pithily expressed the other day by the present Lord Chief Justice
of England: "It is impossible to say what verdict would
have been returned had the case been left to the jury with
a proper direction." Kwaku Mensah v. Rex, [1946] A. C.
83, 94. In that case, the Privy Council found inadequacy
in the direction given by the trial court on considerations
that were not mentioned in the courts below nor raised by

the appellant.

Neither should we permit a death sen-

tence to stand that raises such doubts as does Fisher's
conviction on this record.
As I have already indicated, I do not believe that the
facts warrant a finding of premeditation. But, in any

event, the justification for finding first-degree murder preblaming the doctor for his delay in making the promised visit, believing
he had killed the boy by his treatment, the doctor finally enters. And
when told of the child's death he appears to laugh. This added to his
supposed injuries would fully account for the gust of anger that Caruso
says he felt. Then came the struggle and the homicide.
"As has been said, Caruso had the time to deliberate, to make a
choice whether to kill or not to kill-to overcome hesitation and
doubt-to form a definite purpose. And where sufficient time exists
very often the circumstances surrounding the homicide justify-indeed
require--the necessary inference. Not here, however. No plan to
kill is shown, no intention of violence when the doctor arrived-only
grief and resentment. Not until the supposed laugh did the assault
begin ....

The attack seems to have been the instant effect of im-

pulse. Nor does the fact that the stabbing followed the beginning of
the attack by some time affect this conclusion. It was all one transaction under the peculiar facts of this case. If the assault was not
deliberated or premeditated then neither was the infliction of the fatal
wound." 246 N. Y. at 445-46.

meditation was so tenuous that the jury ought not to
have been left to founder and flounder within the dark
emptiness of legal jargon.' The instructions'to the jury
on the vital issue of premeditation consisted of threadbare
generalities, a jumble of empty abstractions equally suitable for any other charge of murder with none of the elements that are distinctive about this case, mingled with
talk about mental disease. What the jury got was devoid
of clear guidance and illumination. Inadequate direction
to a jury may be as fatal as misdirection. The observations made by this Court in a civil case are especially
pertinent to the duty of a federal judge in a trial for murder: ". . . it, is the right and duty of the court to aid
[the jury] . . . by directing their attention to the most
important facts, .. .by resolving the evidence, however
complicated, into its simplest elements, and by showing
the bearing of its several parts and their combined effect,
stripped of every consideration which might otherwise
mislead or confuse tlem. . . . Constituted as juries are,
it is frequently impossible for them to discharge their
function wisely and well without this aid. In such cases,
chance, mistake, or caprice, may determine the result."
Nudd v. Burrows, 91 U. S.426,439.
Only the other day we exercised our supervisory responsibility over the lower federal courts to assure against the
possibility of unfairness in the operation of the jury system

history, that it is impossible to conceive of trial by jury as existing
there in a form which would withhold from the jury the assistance
of the court in dealing with the facts. Trial by jury, in such a form
as that, is not trial by jury in any historic sense of the words. It
is not the venerated institution which attracted the praise of Blackstone and of our ancestors, but something novel, modern, and much
less to be respected.

the appellant's case at the trialwas in substance that
he had been compelled to use his weapon in necessary self-defencea defence which, if it had been accepted by the jury, would -have
resulted in his complete acquittal-it was undoubtedly the duty of
the judge, in summing up to the jury, to deal adequately with any
other view of the facts which might'reasonably arise out of.the evidence given, and which would reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. The fact that a defending counsel does not stress an.
alternative case before the jury (which he may well feel it difficult
to do without prejudicing the main defence) does not relieve the
judge from the duty of directing the jury to consider the alternative,
if there is material before the jury which would justify a direction
that they should consider it. Thus, in Rex v. Hopper [(1915) 2K. B.

on 'the defence that the killing was accidental, but Lord Reading
C. J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal,
said [id. at 435]: 'We do not assent to-the suggestion that as the
defence throughout the trial was accident, the judge was justified
in not putting the question as to manslaughter. Whatever the line
of defence adopted by counsel at the trial of a prisoner, we are of
opinion that it is for the judge to put such questions as appear to him

have raised some question himself. In this case it may be that the
difficulty of presenting the alternative defences of accident and man-"
slaughter may have actuated counsel in saying very little about manslaughter, but if we come to the conclusion, as we do, that theie was
some evidence-we say no more than that-upon which a question
ought to have been left to the jury as to the crime being manslaughter
only, we think that this verdict of murder cannot stand.'"

the mistake of affirming a death sentence which the jury
may well not have returned had they had a direction that
would have informed their understanding and guided
their judgment. In the circumstances of this case, failure
to charge the jury adequately was to deny Fisher the substance of a fair trial.
Men ought not to go to their doom because this Court
thinks that conflicting legal conclusions of an abstract
nature seem to have been "nicely balanced" by the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The deference
which this Court pays to that Court's adjudications in
ordinary cases involving issues essentially of minor or
merely local importance seems out of place when the action
of this Court, no matter how phrased, sustains a death
sentence at the seat of our Government as a result of a
trial over which this Court, by direction of Congress, has
the final reviewing power. This Court cannot escape
responsibility for the death sentence if it affirms the judgment. One can only hope that even more serious consequences will not follow, which would be the case if the
Court's decision were to give encouragement to doctrines
of criminal law that have only obscurantist precedents of
the past to recommend them. Moreover, a failure adequately to guide a jury on a basic issue, such as that of
premeditation on a charge of murder in the first degree,
does not reflect a "long established" practice, and one
hopes will not become "deeply rooted," in the District.11
11The only authority adduced for what the Court terms long-established practice is United States v. Lee, 4 Mackey (D. C.) 489 (1886).
But that case was decided while common law murder was the law of
the District. The enactment of the Code rendered that case's doctrine
invalid. Counsel for the Government, a distinguished lawyer, Mr.
A. S. Worthington, pointed to the distinction in his argument: "In
jurisdictions where murder is divided into two.degrees-murder in the
first degree requiring deliberation and premeditation; in other words,
actual malice-it has been frequently held that evidence of mental

Quite the contrary standard is indicated by an earlier
opinion of the Court of Appeals. See McAflee V. United

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, dissenting.

As this case reaches us, we are not met with any question as to whether petitioner killed an individual. That
fact is admitted. Our sole concern here is with the charge
given to the jury concerning the elements entering into
the various degrees of murder for which petitioner could
be convicted.
The rule that this Court ordinarily will refrain from
reviewing decisions dealing with matters of local law in
the District of Columbia is a sound and necessary one.
But it is not to be applied without discretion. Like most
rules, this one has its exceptions. And those exceptions
are grounded primarily in considerations of public policy
and of sound administration of justice.
In the past, this Court has seen fit to determine various
common law issues affecting only the District of Columbia.

286 U. S. 191; Best v. District of Columbia, 291 U. S. 411.

excitement resulting from drunkenness and, perhaps, also of other
abnormal conditions of the mind not amounting to insanity, may
reduce an unprovoked homicide to murder in the second degree; but
it has always been held that such evidence cannot of itself reduce the
crime to manslaughter." Id. at 493. The change wrought by Congress is reflected in'Sabens v. United States, 40 App. D. C. 440; Bishop

v. Murphy, 314 U. S. 441. 'n many respects, however,
the problem in this instance itr transcend the ones presented in those cases.
Here we have more than an exercise in statutory construction or in local law. It is a capital case involving
not a question of innocence or guilt but rather a consideration of the proper standards to be used in judging the
degree of guilt. What the Court says and decides here
today will affect the life of the petitioner as well as the
lives of countless future criminals in the District and in
the various states. However guarded may be the Court's
statements, its treatment of petitioner's claims will have
inevitable repercussions in state and federal criminal proceedings. Moreover, these claims, whatever their merit,
afford a rare opportunity to explore some of the frontiers
of criminal law, frontiers that are slowly but undeniably
expanding under the impact of our increasing knowledge
of psychology and psychiatry. These factors are more

than sufficient to warrant a full and careful consideration
of the problems raised by this case.
The issue here is narrow yet replete with significance.
Stated briefly, it is this: May mental deficiency not
amounting to complete insanity properly be considered
by the jury in determining whether a homicide has been
committed with the deliberation and premeditation necessary to constitute first degree murder? The correct answer, in my opinion, was given by this Court more than
sixty years ago in Hopt v. People, 104 U. S.631, 634, when
it said, "But when a statute establishing different degrees
of murder requires deliberate premeditation in order to
constitute murder in the first degree, the question whether
the accused is in such a condition of mind, by reason of
drunkenness or otherwise, as to be capable of deliberate

premeditation, necessarily becomes a material subject of
consideration by the jury." (Italics added.)
The existence of general mental impairment, or partial
insanity, is a scientifically established fact. There is no
absolute or clear-cut dichotomous division of the inhabitants of this world into the sane and the insane. "Between
the two extremes of 'sanity' and 'insanity' lies every shade
of disordered or deficient mental condition, grading imperceptibly one into another." Weihofen, "Partial Insanity
and Criminal Intent," 24 Ill.'L. Rev. 505, 508.
More precisely, there are persons who, while not totally
insane, possess such low mental powers as to be incapable
of the deliberation and premeditation requisite to statutory first degree murder. Yet under the rule adopted by
the court below, the jury must either condemn such persons to death on the false premise that they-possess the
mental requirements of a first degree murderer or free.
them completely from criminal responsibility and turn
them loose among society. The jury is forbidden to find
them guilty of a lesser degree of murder by reason of the;r
generally weakened or disordered intellect,
Common sense and logic recoil at such a rule. And it
is difficult' to marshal support for it from civilized concepts of justice or from the necessity of protecting society.
When a man's life or liberty is at stake he should be adjudged according to his personal culpability as well as by
the objective seriousness of his crime. That elementary
principle of justice is applied to those who kill while intoxicated or in the heat of passion; if such a condition destroys their deliberation and premeditation the jury may
properly consider that fact and convict them of a lesser
degree of murder. No different principle should be utilized in the case of those wh0se mental deficiency is of a
more permanent character. Society, moreover, is ill-protected by a rule'which encourages a jury to acquit a partially insane person with an appealing case simply because

his mental defects cannot be considered in reducing the
degree of guilt.
It is undeniably difficult, as the Government points out,
to determine with any high degree of certainty whether
a defendant has a general mental impairment and
whether such a disorder renders him incapable of the
requisite deliberation and premeditation. The difficulty
springs primarily from the present limited scope of medical and psychiatric knowledge of mental disease. But
this knowledge is ever increasing. And juries constantly
must judge the baffling psychological factors of deliberation and premeditation, Congress having entrusted the
ascertainment of those factors to the good sense of juries.
It seems senseless to shut the door on the assistance which
medicine and psychiatry can give in regard to these matters, however inexact and incomplete that assistance may
presently be. Precluding the consideration of mental
deficiency only makes the jury's decision on deliberation
and premeditation less intelligent and trustworthy.
It is also said that the proposed rule would require a
revolutionary change in criminal procedure in the District
of Columbia and that this Court should therefore leave
the matter to local courts or to'Congress. I cannot agree.
Congress has already spoken by making the distinction
between first and second degree murder turn upon the
existence of deliberation and premeditation. It is the
dpty of the courts below to fashion rules to permit the
jlry to u tilize all relevant evidence directed toward those
factors. But when the courts below adopt rules which
substantially impair the jury's function in this respect,
this Court should exercise its recognized prerogative.
If, as a result, new rules of evidence or new modes of
treatment for 'the partly defective must be devised, our
system of criminal jurisprudence will be that much further enlightened. Such progress clearly outweighs any
temporary dislocation of settled modes of procedure.

MR.

JUSTICE RUTLEDGE,

dissenting.

A revolting crime, such as was committed here, requires
unusual circumspection for its trial, so that dispassionate
judgment may have sway over the inevitable tendency
of the facts to introduce prejudice or passion into the judgment. This means that the accused must not be denied
any substantial safeguard for control of those influences.
A trial for a capital offense which falls short of that standard, although unwittingly, does not give him his due.
Congress introduced the requirements of premeditation
and deliberation into the District of Columbia Code, Title
22, §§ 2401, 2404, in 1901. 31 Stat. 1321, with which
compare Rev. Stat. § 5339. I do not think it intended
by doing so to change the preexisting law only in cases of
intoxication. Hence, I cannot assent'to the view that
the instructions given to the jury were adequate on this
phase of the case. I think the defendant was entitled to
the requested instruction which was refused, or one of
similar import.
I have no doubt that the trial court declined to give it
believing that it was not -required, perhaps also that it
would be erroneous. For the fair-minded and able assistant district attorney who argued the case here conceded,
with characteristic candor, that the courts of the District
have consistently limited the effect of the controlling Code
provision, by way of changing the preexisting law, to cases
of intoxication. But, for the reasons in the opinion of
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, I do not think Congress intended
t he change to be restricted so narrowly. Accordingly I
join in that opinion.
