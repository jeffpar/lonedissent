promoting concentration of railroad control. It has
emphatically indicated that the rights of junior interests,
reflecting public interests, should be more carefully safeguarded. Whether Congress has been wise or unwise in
manifesting this view is not our business to decide.
But it is the business of this Court to respect what I find
to be a clear enunciation by Congress of the conditions
which alone authorize courts to sanction a railroad
reorganization.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 804.

Argued March 7, 8, 1946.-Decided June 10, 1946.

Three persons who were qualified to vote in congressional districts
of Illinois which have much larger populations than other congressional districts of that State, brought suit in a Federal District
Court in Illinois, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, to restrain
officers of the State from arranging for an election, in which members of Congress were to be chosen, pursuant to provisions of an
- Illinois law of 1901 governing congressional districts. The complaint alleged that, by reason of later changes in population,
the congressional districts, created by the Illinois law lacked compactness of territory and approxim4te equality of population; and
prayed a decree, with incidental relief, declaring the provisions
of the state law invalid as in violation of various provisions of the
Federal Constitution and in conflict with the Reapportionment
Act of 1911, as amended. The District Court dismissed the comPp. 550plaint. Held, dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.
551,556.
64 F. Supp. 632, affirmed.

Appeal from a decree of a District Court of three judges,
64 F. Supp. 632, which dismissed the complaint in a suit
to restrain state officers from acting pursuant to provisions
of a state election law alleged to be invalid under the
Federal Constitution. Affirmed, p. 556.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

announced the judgment of

the Court and an opinion in which MR.
and MR.

JUSTICE REED

JUSTICE BURTON concur.

This case is appropriately here, under § 266 of the Judicial Code. 28 U. S. C. § 380. on direct review of a judgment
of the Distri~r Court of the Northern :District of Illinois,
composed of three judges, dismissing. the complaint of
the appellants. These are three qualified voters in Illinois districts which have much larger populations than
other Illinois Congressional districts. They brought this
suit against- the Governor- the Secretary of State. and
the Auditor of the State of Illinois. as members ex officio
of the Illinois Primary Certifying Board, to restrain them,
in effect, from taking proceedings for an election in November 1946, under the provisions of Illinois law governing Congressional districts. Illinois Laws of 1901, p. 3.
Formally, the appellants asked for a decree, with its incidental relief. § 274 (d) Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 400,
declaring these provisions to be invalid because they violated various provisions of the United States Constitution
and ., 3 of the Reapportionment Act of August S. 1911,
37 Stat. 13. as amended, 2 U. S. C. . 2a, in that by reason
of subsequent changes in population the Congressional
districts for the election of Representatives in the Congress created by the Illinois Laws of 1901 (I1. Rev. Stat.
Ch. 46 (1945) § 154-56) lacked compactness of terri-

tory and approximate equality of population. The District Court, feeling bound by this Court's opinion in Wood
V. Broom, 287.U. S. 1, dismissed the complaint. 64 F.
Supp. 632.
The District Coiart was clearly right in deeming itself
bound by Wood V. Broom, supra, and we could also dispose
of this case on'the authority of Wood v. Broom. The
legal merits of th', controversy were settled in that case,
inasmuch as it held that the Reapportionment Act of
June 18, 1929, 46 Stat. 21, as amended, 2 U. S. C. § 2 (a),.
has no requirements "as to the compactness, contiguity
and equality in population of districts." 287 U. S. at 8.
The Act of 1929 still governs the districting for the election
of Representatives. It must be remembered that not
only was the legislative history of the matter fully con,sidered in Wood v. Broom, but the question had been
elaborately before the Court in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S.
355,.Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U: S. 375, and Carrollv. Becker,
285 U. S. 380, argued a few months before Wood v. Broom
was decided. Nothing has now been adduced to lead us
to overrule what this Court found to be the requirements
under the 'Act of 1929, the more so since seven Congressional elections have been held under the Act of 1929 as
construed by this Court. No manifestation has been
shown by Congress even to question the correctness of
that which seemed compelling to this Court in enforcing
the will of Congress in Wood v. Broom.
But we also agree with the four Justices (Brandeis,
Stone, Roberts, and Cardozo, JJ.) who were of opinion
that the bill in Wood v. Broom, supra,should be "dismissed
for want of tquity." To be sure, the present complaint,
unlike the bill in Wood v. Broom, was brought under the
Federal Declaratory Judgment Act which, not having been
enacted until 1934, was not available at the time of Wood
v. Broom. But that Act merely gave the federal courts
competence to make a declaration of rights even though

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of

328 U. S.

no decree of enforcement be immediately asked. It
-merely permitted a freer movement of the federal courts
within the recognized confines of the scope of equity. The
Declaratory Judgment Act "only provided a new form
of procedure for the adjudication of rights in conformity"
with "established equitable principles." Great Lakes Co.
v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293, 300. And so, the test for
determining whether a federal court has authority to make
a declaration -such as is here asked, is whether the. controversy "would be justiciable in this Court if presented
in a suit for injunction . . ." Nashville, C. & St. L. R.
Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249,262.
We are of opinion that the appellants ask of this Court
what is beyond its competence to grant. ,This is one of
those demands on judicial power which cannot be met
by verbal fencing about "jurisdiction." It must be resolved by considerations on the basis of which this Court,.
from time to time, has refused to intervene in controversies. It has refused to do so because due regard for
the effective working of our Government revealed this
issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore
not meet for judicial determination.
This is not an action to recover for damage because,
of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights
enjoyed by other citizens., The basis for the suit is not
a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a
polity. Compare Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536 and
Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, with Giles v. Harris, 189
U. S. 475. In effect this is an appeal to the federal courts
to reconstruct the electoral process of Illinois in order that
it may be adequately represented in the councils of the
Nation. Because the Illinois legislature has failed to
revise its Congressional Representative districts in order
to reflect great changes, during more than a generation,
in the distribution of its population, we are asked to do
this, as it were, for Illinois.

COLEGROVE v. GREEN.
549

Opinion of

FRANKFURTER,

J.

Of course no court can affirmatively re-map the Illinois
districts so as to bring them more in conformity with the
standards of fairness for a representative system. At best
we could only declare the existing electoral system invalid.
The result would be to leave Illinois undistricted and to
bring into operation, if the Illinois legislature chose not
to act, the choice of members for the House of Representatives on a state-wide ticket. The last stage may be worse
than the first. The upshot of judicial action may defeat
the vital political principle which led Congress, more than
a hundred years ago, to require districting. This requirement, in the language of Chancellor Kent, "was recommended by the wisdom and justice of giving, as far as
possible, to the local subdivisions of the people of each
state, a due influence in the choice of representatives, so
as not to leave the aggregate minority of the people in
a state, though approaching perhaps to a majority, to be
wholly overpowered by the combined action of the numerical majority, without any voice whatever in t~le national
councils." 1 Kent, Commentaries (12th ed., 1873) "230:31, n. (c). Assuming acquiescence on the part of the
authorities of Illinois in the selection of its Representatives by a mode that defies the direction of Congress for
selection by districts, the House of Representatives may
not acquiesce. In the exercise of its power to judge the
qualifications of its own members, the House may reject
a delegation of Representatives-at-large. Article I, § 5,
Cl. 1. For the detailed system by which Congress supervises the election of its members, see e. g., 2 U. S. C. § § 201226; Bartlett, Contested Elections in the House of Representatives (2 vols.); Alexander, History and Procedure
of the House of Representatives (1916) c. XVI. Nothing
is clearer than that this controversy concerns matters that
bring courts into immediate and active relations with
party contests. From the determination of such issues
this Court has traditionally held aloof. It is hostile to

554

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of FwaNi'uwrm, J.

328 U. S.

a democratic system to involve the judiciary in the politics
of the people. And it isnot less pernicious if such judicial intervention -in an essentially political contest be
dressed up in the abstract phrases of the law.
The appellants urge with great zeal that the conditions
of which they complain are grave evils and offend public
morality. The Constitution of the United States gives
ample power to provide against these evils. But due regard for the Constitution as a viable system precludes
judicial correction. Authority for dealing with such
problems resides elsewhere. Article I, § 4 of the Constitution provides that "The Times, Places and Manner of
holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof-; but the
Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
Regulations, . . ." The short of it is that the Constitution has conferred upon Congress exclusive authority
to secure fair representation by the States in the popular
House and left to that House determination whether
States have fulfilled their responsibility. If Congress
failed in exercising its powers, whereby standards of fairness are offended, the remedy ultimately lies with the
people. Whether Congress faithfully discharges its duty
or not, the subject has been committed to the exclusive
control- of Congress. An aspect of government from
which the judiciary, in view of what is involved, has been
excluded by the clear intention of the Constitution cannot
be entered by the federal courts because Congress may
have been in default in xacting from States obedience
to its mandate.
The one stark fact that emerges from a study of the
history of Congressional apportionment is its embroilment in politics, in the sense of pai ty contests and party
interests. The Constitution enjoins upon Congress the
duty of apportioning Representatives "among the several
States . .. according to their respective Numbers, . . .

COLEGROVE v. GREEN.
549

Opinion of

FRANKIURTER, J.

Article I, § 2. Yet, Congress has at times been heedless
of this command and not apportioned according to the
requirements of the Census. It never occurred to anyone
that this Court could issue mandamus to compel Congress
to perform its mandatory duty to apportion. "What
might not be done directly by mandamus, could not be
attained indirectly by injunction." Chafee, Congre8sional Reapportionment (1929) 42 Harv. L. Rev. 1015,
1019. Until 1842 there was the greatest diversity among
the States in the manner of choosing Representatives
because Congress had made no requirement for districting.
5 Stat. 491. Congress then provided for the election of
Representatives by districts. Strangely enough, the
power to do so was seriously questioned; it was still
doubted by a Committee of Congress as late as 1901. See
e. g., Speech of Mr. (afterwards Mr. Justice) Clifford,
Cong. Globe, April 28, 1842, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., App.,
p. 347; 1 Bartlett, Contested Elections in the House of
Representatives (1865) 47, 276; H. R. Rep. No. 3000,
56th Cong., 2d Sess. (1901); H. R. Doc. No. 2052, 64th
Cong., 2d Sess. (1917) 43; United States v. Gradwell, 243
U. S. 476, 482, 483. In 1850 Congress dropped the requirement. 9 Stat. 428, 432-33. The Reapportionment
Act of 1862 required that the districts be of contiguous
territory. 12 Stat. 572. In 1872 Congress added the
requirement of substantial equality of inhabitants. 17
Stat. 28. This was reinforced in 1911. 37 Stat. 13, 14.
But the 1929 Act, as we have seen, dropped these requirements. 46 Stat. 21. Throughout our history, whatever
may have been the controlling Apportionment Aot, the
most glaring disparities have prevailed as to the contours
and the population of districts. Appendix I summarizes
recent disparities in the various-Congressional Representative districts throughout the country and Appendix II
gives fair samples of prevailing gerrymanders. For other
illustrations of glaring inequalities, see 71 Cong. Rec.

the Gerrymander (1907).
To sustain this ation would cut very deep into the
very being of Congress. Courts ought not to enter this
.olitical thicket. The remedy for unfairness in districting is to secure State legislatures that will apportion properly, or to invoke the ample powers of Congress. The
Constitution has many commands that are not enforceable
by courts because they clearly fall outside the conditions
and purposes that circumscribe judicial action. Thus,
"on Demand of the executive Authority," Art. IV, § 2,
of a State it is the duty of a sister State to deliver up a
-fugitive from justice. But the fulfilment of this duty
cannot be judicially enforced. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24
How. 66. The duty to see to it that the laws are faithfully executed cannot be brought under legal compulsion,
Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475. Violation of the
great guaranty of a republican form of government in
States cannot be challenged in the courts. Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118. The Constitution
has left the performance of many duties in our governmental scheme to depend on the fidelity of the execut.-ve
and legislative action and, ultimately, on the vigilance
of the people in exercising their political rights.
Dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.

Opinion of

RUTLEDGE, J.

328 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE.

I concur in the result. "But for the ruling in Smiley
v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, I should have supposed that the
provisions of the Constitution, Art. I, § 4, that "The
Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . .
Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the
Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time
by Law make or alter such Regulations . . ."; Art. I, § 2,
vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states "according to their
respective Numbers"; and Art. I, § 5, making each House
the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members,
would remove the issues in this case from justiciable
cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case
rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter
of degree.
Moreover, we have but recently been admonished again
that it is the very essence of our duty to avoid decisioin
upon grave constitutional questions, especially when this
may bring our function into clash with the political departments of the Government, if any tenable alternative
ground for disposition of the controversy is presented. 1
I was unable to find such an alternative in that instance.
There is one, however, in this case. And I think the
gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great,
together with the possibilities for collision above mentioned, that the admonition is appropriate to be followed
here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact
I United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, concurring opinion at 320:
"But the most fundamental principle of constitutional adjudication
is not to face constitutional questions but to avoid them, if at all
possible.. And so. the 'Court developed, for its own governance in
the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under
which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional
questions pressed upon it for decision.'

that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important
ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra,would otherwise be brought
into question.
Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think, with
Mr. Justice Black, that its' effect is to rule that this Couri
has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against
the objection that the issues are not justiciable.
In the later case of Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, the
Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929
Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward
the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined
to decide whether there was equity in the bill. 287 U. S.
1, 8. But, as the Court's opinion notes, four justices
thought the bill should be dismissed for want of equity.'
In my judgment this complaint should be dismissed
for the same reason. Assuming that the~controversy is
justiciable, I think the cause is of so delicate a character,
in view of the considerations above noted, that the jurisdiction should be exercised only in the most compelling
circumstances.
As a matter of legislative attention, whether by Congress or the General Assembly, the case made by the complaint is strong. But the relief it seeks pitches this Court
into delicate relation to the functions of state officials and
Congress, compelling them to take action which heretofore
they have declined to take voluntarily or to accept the
alternative of electing representatives from Illinois at
large in the forthcoming elections.
The shortness of the time remaining makes it doubtful
whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure
for petitioners the effective relief they seek. To force

in the same manner as want of jurisdiction over the subject matter.

them to share in an election at large might bring greater
equality of voting right. It would also deprive them and
all other Illinois citizens of representation by districts
which the prevailing policy of Congress commands. 46
Stat. 26, as amended; 2 U. S. C. §2a.
If the constitutional provisions on which appellants
rely give them the substantive rights they urge, other provisions qualify those rights in important ways by vesting
large measures of control in the political subdivisions of
the Government and the state. There is not, and could
not be except abstractly, a right of absolute equality in
voting. At best there could be only a rough approximation. And there is obviously considerable latitude for the
bodies vested with those powers to exercise their judgment
concerning how best to attain this, in full consistency
,th the Constitution.

The right here is not absolute. And the cure sought
may be worse than the disease.
I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court
may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction.3 Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and
I join in that disposition of the cause.

The complaint alleges the following facts essential to
the position i take: Appellants, citizens and voters of
Illinois, live in congressional election districts, the respective populations of which range from 612,000 to 914,000.
Twenty other congressional election districts have populations that range from 112,116 to 385,207. In seven of

these districts the population is below 200,000.. The Illinois Legislature established these districts in 1901 on the
basis of the Census of 1900. The Federal Census of 1910,
of 1920, of 1930, and of 1940, each showed a growth of
population in Illinois and a substantial shift in the distribution of population among the districts established
in 1901. But up to date, attempts to have the State
Legislature reapportion congressional election districts so
as more nearly to equalize their population have been
unsuccessful. A contributing cause of this situation,
according to appellants, is the fact that the State Legislature is chosen on the basis of state election districts
inequitably apportioned in a way similar to that of the
1901 congressional election districts. The implication is
that the issues of state and congressional apportionment
are thus so interdependent that it is to the interest of
state legislators to perpetuate the inequitable apportionment of both state and congressional. election districts.
Prior to this proceeding a series of suits had been brought
in ,the state courts challenging the State's local and federal apportionment system. In all these cases the Supreme Court of the State had denied effective relief.1
In the present suit the complaint attacked the 1901
State Apportionment Act on the ground that it among
other things violates Article I and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Appellants claim that since
they live in the heavily populated districts their vote is
much less effective than the vote of those living in a
district which under the 1901 Act is also allowed to choose
one Congressman, though its population is sometimes

only one-ninth that of the heavily populated districts.
Appellants contend that this reduction of the effectiveness
of their vote is the result of a wilful legislative discrimination against them and thus amounts to a denial of the
equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. They further assert that this reduction of
the effectiveness of their vote also violates the privileges
and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in
abridging .their privilege as citizens of the United States
to vote for Congressmen, a privilege guaranteed by Article
I of the Constitution, They further contend that the
State Apportionment Act directly violates Article I which
guarantees that each citizen eligible to vote has a right
to vote for Congressmen and to have his vote counted.
The assertion here is that the right to have their vote
counted is abridged unless that vote is given approximately equal weight to that of other citizens. It is my
judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction;' that
the complaint presented a justiciable case and controversy; ' and that appellants had standing to sue, since
the facts alleged show that they have been injured as
individuals.' Unless previous decisions of this Court are
to be -overruled, the suit is not one against the State but
against state officials as individuals.' The complaint attacked the 1901 Apportionment Act as unconstitutional
and alleged facts indicating that the Act denied appellants
the full right to vote and the equal protection of the laws.

These allegations have not been denied. Under these
circumstances, and since there is no adequate legal remedy
for depriving a citizen of his right to vote, equity can and
should grant relief.
It is difficult for me to see why the 1901 State Apportionment Act does not deny appellants equal protection
of the laws. The failure of the Legislature to reapportion
the congressional election districts for forty years, despite
census figures indicating great changes in the distribution
of the population, has resulted in election districts the
populations of which range from 112,000 to 900,000. One
of the appellants lives in a district of more than 900,000
people. His vote is consequently much less effective than
that of each of the citizens living in the district of 112,000.
And such a gross inequality in the voting power of citizens
irrefutably demonstrates a complete lack of effort to make
an equitable apportionment. The 1901 State Apportionment Act if applied to the next election would thus result
in a wholly indefensible discrimination against appellants
and all other voters in heavily populated districts. The
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
forbids such discrimination. It does not permit the States
to pick out certain qualified citizens or groups of citizens
and deny them the right to vote at all. See Nixon v.
Herudon, 273 U. S. 53.6, 541; Nixon v. Cbndon, 286 U. S.
73. No 9ne would deny that the equal protection clause
would also prohibit a law that would expressly give certain
citizens a half-vote and others a full vote. The probable
effect of the 1901 State Apportionment Act in the coming
election will be that certain citizens, and among them the
appellants, will, in some instances have votes only oneninth as effective in choosing representatives to Congress
as the votes of other citizens. Such discriminatory legislation seems to me exactly the kind that the equal protection clause was intended to prohibit.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
BLACK,

J., dissenting.

328 U. S.

The 1901 State Apportionment Act in reducing the
effectiveness of appellants' votes abridges their privilege
as citizens to vote for Congressmen and violates Article I
of the Constitution. Article I provides that Congressmen
"shall be . . . chosen . . . by the People of the several

States . . ." It thus gives those qualified a right to vote
and a right to have their vote counted. Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651; United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S.
383. This Court in order to prevent "an interference
with the effective choice of the voters" has held that this
right extends to primaries. United States v. Classic, 313
U. S. 299, 314. While the Constitution contains no
express provision requiring that congressional election
districts established by the States must contain approximately equal populations, the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote and the right to have one's vote counted
clearly imply the policy that state election systems, no
matter what their form, should be designed to give approximately equal weight to each vote cast. To some extent
this implication of Article I is expressly stated by § 2
of the Fourteenth Amendment which provides that "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States
according to their respective numbers . " The purpose of this requirement is obvious: It is to make the
votes of the citizens of the several States equally effective
in the selection of members of Congress. It was intended
to make illegal a nation-wide "rotten borough" system
as between the States. The policy behind it is broader
than that. It prohibits as well congressional "rotten
boroughs" within the States, such as the ones here involved. The policy is that which is laid down by all the
constitutional provisions regulating the election of members of the House of Representatives, including Article
I which guarantees the right, to vote and to have that
vote effectively counted: All groups, classes, and indi-

viduals shall to the extent that it is practically feasible
be given equal representation in the House of Representatives, which, in conjunction with the Senate, writes the
laws affecting the life, liberty, and property of all the
people.
It is true that the States are authorized by § 2 of Article
I of the Constitution to legislate on the subject of congressional elections to the extent that Congress has not
done so. Thus the power granted to the State Legislature
on this subject is primarily derived from the Federal and
not from the State Constitution. But this federallygranted power with respect to elections of Congressmen
is not to formulate policy but rather to implement the
policy laid down in the Constitution, that, so far as feasible, votes be given equally effective weight. Thus, a
state legislature cannot deny eligible voters the right to
vote for Congressmen and the right to have their vote
counted. It can no more destroy the effectiveness of their
vote in part and no more accomplish this in the name
of "apportionment" than under any other name. For
legislation which must inevitably bring about glaringly
unequal representation in the Congress in favor of special
classes and groups should be invalidated, "whether accomplished ingeniously or ingenuously." Smith v. Teras,
311 U. S. 128, 132. See also Lane v. 'Wilson, 307 U. S.
268, 272.
Had Illinois passed an Act requiring that all of its
twenty-six Congressmen be elected by the citizens of
one county, it would clearly have amounted to a denial
to the citizens of the other counties of their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. And I cannot imagine that
an Act that would have apportioned twenty-five Congressmen to the State's smallest county and one Congressman to all the others, would have been sustained by any
court. Such'an Act would clearly have violated the con-

stitutional policy of equal representation. The 1901
Apportionment Act here involved violates that policy in
the same way. The policy with respect to federal elections laid down by the Constitution, while it does not
mean that the courts can or should prescribe the precise
methods to be followed by state legislatures and the invalidation of all Acts that do not embody those precise
methods, does mean that state legislatures must make real
efforts to bring about approximately equal representation
of citizens in Congress. Here the Legislature of Illinois
has not done so. Whether that was due to negligence or
was a wilful effort to deprive some citizens of an effective
vote, the admitted result is that the constitutional policy
of equality of representation has been defeated. Under
these circumstances it is the Court's duty to invalidate
the state law.
It is contended, however, that a court of equity does
not have the power, or even if it has the power, that it
should not exercise it in this case. To do so, it is argued,
would mean that the Court is entering the area of "political
questions." I cannot agree with that argument. There
have, been cases, such as Coleman v. Miller, supra, pp.
454, 457, where this Court declined to decide a question
because it was political. In the Miller case, however, the
question involved was ratification of a constitutional
amendment, a matter over which the Court believed Congress had been given final authority. To have decided
that question would have amounted to a trespass upon
the constitutional power of Congress. Here we have
before us a state law which abridges the constitutional
rights of citizens to cast votes in such way as to obtain
the kind of congressional representation the Constitution
guarantees to them.
It is true that voting is a part of elections and that
elections are "political." But as this-Court said in Nixon

COLEGROVE v. GREEN.
549

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

v. Herndon, supra, it is a mere "play upon words" to refer
to a controversy such as this as "political" in the sense
that courts have nothing to do with protecting and vindicating the right of a voter to cast an effective ballot. The
Classic case, among myriads of others, refutes the contention that courts are impotent in connection with evasions
of all "political" rights. Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1,
does not preclude the granting of equitable relief in this
case. There this Court simply held that the State Apportionment Act did not violate the Congressional Reapportionment Act of 1929, 46 Stat. 21, 26, 27, since that
Act did not require election districts of equal population.
The Court expressly reserved the question of "the right
of the complainant to relief in equity." Giles v. Harris,
189 U. S. 475, also did not hold that a court of equity
could not, or should not, exercise its power in a case like
this. As we said with reference to that decision in Lane
v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 272-273, it stands for the principle that courts will not attempt to "supervise" elections.
Furthermore, the author of the Giles v. Harrisopinion also.
wrote the opinion in Nixon v. Herndon, in which a voter's
right to cast a ballot was held to give rise to. a justiciable
controversy.
In this case, no supervision over elections is asked for.
What is asked is that this Court do exactly what it did
in Smiley v. Holm, supra. It is asked to declare a state
apportionment bill invalid and to enjoin state officials
from enforcing it. The only difference between this case
and the Smiley case is that there the case originated
in the state courts while here the proceeding originated in
the Federal District Court. The only type of case in
which this Court has held that a federal district court
should in its discretion stay its hand any more than a
state court is where the question is one which state courts
or administrative agencies have special competence to

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

decide. This is not that type of question. What is involved here is the right to vote guaranteed by the Federal
Constitution. It has always been the rule that where
a federally protected right has been invaded the federal
courts will provide the remedy to rectify the wrong done.
Federal courts have not hesitated to exercise their equity
power in cases involving deprivation of property and liberty. Ex parte Young, supra; Hague v. C. 1. 0., 307
U. S. 496. There is no reason why they should do so
where the case involves the right to choose representatives
that make laws affecting liberty and property.
Nor is there any more difficulty in enforcing a decree
in this case than there was in the Smiley case. It is true
that declaration of invalidity of the State Act and the
enjoining of state officials would result in prohibiting
the State from electing Congressmen under the system of
the .old congressional districts. But it would leave the
State free to elect them from the State at large, which, as
we held in the Smiley case, is a manner authorized by the
Constitution. It is said that it would be inconvenient
for the State to conduct the election in this manner. But
it has an element of virtue that the more convenient
method does not have-namely, it does not discriminate
against some groups to favor others, it gives all the people
an equally effective voice in electing their representatives as is essential under a free government, and it
is constitutional.
