DAVIS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 404. Argued February 5, 1946.-Decided June 10, 1946.
1. Having obtained clear eyidence of violations of the gasoline rationing regulations through sales without coupons and at above-ceiling
prices (which are misdemeanors), officers arrested petitioner, president of the corporation which maintained the offending filling station, at his place of business during business hours and demanded
ration coupons covering the aggregate amount of sales. After
refusing at first, petitioner .,_.i acquiesced and surrenderd the
coupons. In his trial for possessing them unlawfully (a misdemeanor), petitioner contended that there had been an unlawful
search which resulted in seizure of the coupons and their use in evidence against him, in violation of his rights under the Fourth and
Fifth Amendments. The evidence was conflicting; but the District
Cox~rt found that he had consented to the search and seizure and
that no force or threat of force had been employed to persuade him. /
He was convicted. Held: The conviction is affirmed, because this
Court cannot say as a matter of law that the. District Court's
finding of fact was erroneous. Pp. 593,594.
2. The gasoline ration coupons never became the private property of
the holder but remained at all times the property of the Government
and subject to inspection and recall by it. P. 588.
3. In the law of searches and seizures a -distinction is made between
private papers or documents and public property in .the custody of
a citizen. WilsQn v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, Pp. 589-591.
4. Whatever may be the limits of inspection under the regulations,
law enforcement is not so impotent as to require officers who have
the right to inspect a place of business to stand mute when clear
evidence of criminal activity is known to them. Amos v. United
States, 255 U. S. 313, distinguished. Pp. 592, 593.
5. Where officers 'seek to inspect public documents at the place of business where they are required to be kept, permissible, limits of persuasion are not so narrow as where private papers are sought, since
the demand is one of right: P. 593.

objection that there was an unlawful search which resulted

The Office of Price Administration, to which that power had been
delegated, issued ration orders for gasoline. Ration Order No. 5C,
as it read on June 20, 1944 (8 Fed. Reg. 16423),' provided in part as
follows:
Sec. 1394.8177 (c): "No person shall have in his possession any
gasoline deposit certificate, folder, or any coupon book, inventory
or other coupon (whether or not such book was issued as a ration "
book and whether or not such coupon was issued as a ration or as
part of a ration book) or other evidence, or any identifying folder,
except the person, or the agent of the person, to whom such book,
coupon, certificate or folder was issued or by whom it was acquired
in accordance with the provisions of Ration Book [sic] No. 5C."
Sec. 1394.8217 (a): "Every dealer and intermediate distributor
shall be accountable for all gasoline, ration credits, gasoline deposit
certificates, coupons and other evidences received by him. Gasoline
deposit certificates, coupons and other evidences received at or for
a place of business shall be, at all times when the dealer or distributor
is open to transact business, retained by him at the place of business
for which they were received, or deposited in a ration bank account
maintained for that place of business, until such time as they are
surrendered to a dealer or distributor in exchange for gasoline, or
otherwise surrendered pursuant to Ration Order No. 5C. The aggregate gallonage value of gasoline deposit certificates, coupons and other
evidences on hand or on deposit for each place of business of a dealer
or intermediate distributor, shall, at all times, be equal to, but not
in excess of, the number of gallons of gasoline which would be required
to fill the storage capacity of such place of business, as shown by the
current certificate of registration, . . ." 8 Fed. Reg. 15981.

violation of the rule of Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S.
383, United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452, and related
cases. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the importance of
the question presented.
Davis was president of a corporation by the name of
Davis Auto Laundry Corporation which maintained a
gasoline filling station in New York City. He was suspected of running a black market in gasoline. Several
agents drove to a place near the gasoline station and
observed it for a few hours. They had no search warrant
nor a warrant for the arrest of petitioner. Two of the
agents drove their cars into the station and asked for gas.
Petitioner was not present at the time. But an attendant, an employee of petitioner, was present and waited
on them. Through her each of the two agents succeeded
in purchasing gas without gasoline ration stamps by. paying twenty cents a gallon above the ceiling price. Shortly
thereafter they arrested her for selling gasoline without
coupons and above the ceiling price. She said that in
doing so she was following petitioner's instructions.
While she was being questioned by the agents, petitioner
returned to the station in his car. They immediately
arrested him on the same charge as the attendant 2 and
searched his car. They demanded and received from him
the keys to tin boxes attached to the gasoline pumps and
in which gasoline ration coupons were kept. One of them
began to examine and measure the gasoline storage tanks
and their contents. It soon appeared that the gasoline
ration coupons found in the tin boxes were not sufficient
2 Selling gasoline without receipt of ration coupons, selling gasoline
in excess of the ceiling price, or unlawfully possessing ration coupons
is a misdemeanor. See § 2 (a), supra, note 1. A felony is an offense

to cover the amount by which the capacity of the storage
tanks had been diminished by sales.
While this examination of the storage tanks was under
way, petitioner went with two of the agents into his office
which was on the premises.' The office consisted of a
waiting room and inner room. He was questioned in the
waiting room for about an hour. A door led from the
waiting room into the inner room where records were kept.
The door to it was locked. Petitioner at first refused to
open it. When told that the examination of the tanks
had revealed a shortage of coupons, petitioner assured the
agents that he had sufficient coupons to cover the shortage
and that they were in the locked room. The officers asked
to see the coupons and based their demand on the fact
that the coupons were property of the Government of
which petitioner was only the custodian. Petitioner persisted, however, in his refusal to unlock the door. Before,
long he did unlock it, took from a filing cabinet the coupons
on which the conviction rests, and gave them to the agents.
He testified that he did so because the agents threatened
to break down the door if he did not. The District Court
did not believe petitioner's version of the episode. One
agent testified: "Q. Did you try to convince Davis that
he ought to open that door leading into the private office?
A. I didn't try to convince him. I told him that he
would have to open that door. Q. Did you tell him if
he did not you would break it down? A. I did not tell
him that at all." And it appeared that while the two
agents were talking with Davis in the waiting room,
another agent was in the rear shining a flashlight through
an outside window of the inner room and apparently trying

to raise the window. According to one of the agents, when
petitioner saw that, he said, "He don't need to do that.
I will open the damned door." Some six weeks later
petitioner was arrested on a warrant and arraigned.
The District Court found that petitioner had consented
to the search and seizure and that his consent was voluntary. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not disturb that
finding, although it expressed some doubt concerning it.
In its view, the seized coupons were properly introduced
into evidence because the search and seizure, being incidental to the arrest, were "reasonable" regardless of petitioner's consent.
The Fourth Amendment provides:
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized."
And the Fifth Anendment provides in part that "No
person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to
be a witness against himself . . ."
The law of searches and seizures as revealed in the
decisions of this Court is the product of the interplay of
these two constitutional provisions. Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616. It reflects a dual purpose-protection of the privacy of the individual, his right to be
let alone; protection of the individual against compulsory
production of evidence to be used against him. Boyd v.
United States, supra; Weeks v. United States, supra.
And see Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S.

We do not stop to review all of our decisions which
define the scope of "reasonable" searches and seizures.
For they have largely developed out of cases involving

the search and seizure of private papers. We are dealing
here not with private papers or documents, but with gasoline ration coupons which never became the private property of the holder but remained at all times the property
of the Government and subject to inspection and recall
by it.
At the times relevant here, gasoline was rationed.
Dealers could lawfully sell it only on receipt of ration
coupons.' They in turn could receive their supplies of
gasoline from the distributors only on delivery of coupons.'
It was required that a dealer at all times have coupons
on hand at his place of business or in a bank equal to but
not in excess of the gallonage necessary to fill his storage
tanks.' Possession bf coupons obtained in contravention
of the regulations was unlawful.7 The coupons remained
the property of the Office of Price Administration ' and
were at all times subject to recall by it.' And they were
subject to inspection'at all times."0

Opinion of the Court.

We are thus dealing not with private papers or documents but with public property in the custody of a citizen.
The distinction between the two classes of property in
the law of searches and seizures was recognized in Wilson
v. United States, 221 U. S. 361, 380, where the Court
stated:
"But the physical custody of incriminating documents does not of itself protect the custodian against
their compulsory production. The question still
remains with respect to the nature of the documents
and the capacity in which they are held, It may
yet appear that they are of a character which subjects
them to the scrutiny demanded and that the custodian has'voluntarily assumed a duty which overrides
his claim of privilege. This was clearly implied in
the Boyd Case where the fact that the papers involved
were the private papers of the claimant was constantly emphasized. Thus, in the case of public
records and official documents, made or kept in the
administration of public office, the fact of actual possession or of lawful custody would not justify the
officer in resisting inspection, even though the record
was made by himself and would supply the evidence
of his criminal dereliction. If he has embezzled the
enforcement officer of the United States or of any state, county,
or local government, every person shall produce for inspection
any tire inspection record and gasoline deposit certificate and any
gasoline coupon books, coupons, and other evidences in his pos-

session or control, whether valid, invalid, void or expired ...

in accordance with Ration Order No. 5C. Investigators of the

Office of Price Administration and all police officers, constables
and other law enforcement officers of the United States, or of
any state, county or local government are authorized to make
such inquiries of any person as may.be pertinent to determine
whether a violation of Ration Order No. 5C has been or is being
committed, and are authorized to receive the surrender of all
gasoline deposit certificates, gasoline coupon books, coupons and
other evidences acquired by any person otherwise than in accordance with Ration Order No. 5C, whether valid, invalid, void or
expired."
As to the power of inspection given by the Act of June 28, 1940, see
§ 2 (a) (3), supra, note 1.

public moneys and falsified the public accounts he
cannot seal his official records and withhold them
from the prosecuting authorities on a plea of constitutional privilege against self-crimination. The
principle applies not only to public documents in
public offices, but also to records required by law to
be kept in order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation and the enforcement
of restrictions validly established. There the privilege, which exists as to private papers, cannot be
maintained."
The Court proceeded to analyze the English and American authorities and added, pp. 381-382:
"The fundamental ground of decision in this class
of cases, is that where, by virtue of their character
and the rules of law applicable to them, the books
and papers are held subject to examination by the
demanding authority, the custodian has no privilege
to refuse production although their contents tend
to criminate him. In assuming their custody he
has accepted the incident obligation to permit
inspection."
The distinction is between property to which the Goyernment is entitled to possession and property to which it
is not." See 8 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) § 2259c.
11This distinction was noted in another connection in Boyd v.
United States, supra,pp. 623-624, where the Court said:
"The searcn for and seizure, of stolen or forfeited goods, or
goods liable to duties and concealed to avoid the payment thereof,
are totally different things from a search for and seizure of a
man's private books and papers for the purpose of obtaining
information therein contained, or of using them as evidence
against him. The two things differ toto coelo. In the one case,
the government is entitled to the possession of the property;
in the other it is not. The seizure of stolen goods is authorized
by the common law; and the seizure of goods forfeited for
a breach of the revenue laws, or concealed to avoid the duties
payable on them, has been authorized by English statutes for
at least two centuries past; and the like seizures have been
authorized by our own revenue acts from the commencement

DAVIS v. UNITED STATES.
582

Opinion of the Court.

The distinction has had important repercussions in the
law, beyond that indicated by Wilson v. United States,
supra. For an owner of property who seeks to take it
from one who is unlawfully in possession has long been
recognized to have greater leeway than he would have
but for his right to possession. The claim of ownership
will even justify a trespass and warrant iteps otherwise
unlawful. Richardson v. Anthony, 12 Vt 273; Madden
v. Brown, 8 App. Div. 454,40 N. Y. S. 714; State v. Dooley,
121 Mo. 591, 26 S. W. 558.
We do not suggest that officers seeking to reclaim government property may proceed lawlessly and subject to
no restraints. Nor do we suggest that the right to inspect
under the regulations subjects a dealer to a general search
of his papers for the purpose of learning whether he has
any coupons subject to inspection and seizure. The
nature of the coupons is important here merely as indicating that the officers did not exceed the permissible
limits of persuasion in obtaining them.
of the government. The first statute passed by Congress to
regulate the collection of duties, the act of July 31, 1789, 1 Stat.
29, 43, contains provisions to this effect. As this act was passed
by the same Congress which proposed for adoption the original
amendments to the Constitution, it is clear that the members of
that body did not regard searches and seizures of this kind as
'unreasonable,' and they are not embraced within the prohibition
of the amendment. So, also, the supervision authorized to be
exercised by officers of the revenue over the manufacture or

custody of excisable articles, and the entries thereof in books

required by law to be kept for their inspection, are necessarily
excepted out of the category of unreasonable searches and seizures.
So, also, the laws which provide for the search and seizure of
articles and things which it is unlawful for a person to have
in his possession for the purpose of issue or disposition, such

as counterfeit coin, lottery tickets, implements of
are not within this category. Commonwealth v.
(Mass.) 329."

They appeared on the premises during business hours.
They had ocular evidence that a misdemeanor had been
committed, a crime to which petitioner was an aider or
abetter,'" since, according to the attendant, she made the
illegal sales pursuant to petitioner's instructions. Since
sales were being made without receipt of coupons from
customers, it was fair to assume (unless, as was at no
time suggested, the business was being liquidated) that
petitioner somewhere had a supply of coupons adequate
to replenish his storage tanks. The inspection which was
made was an inspection of the tanks attached to the
pumps. And the search was of the office adjacent to the
pumps-the place where petitioner transacted his business. Moreover, the officers demanded the coupons on
the basis that they were property of the Government and
that petitioner was merely the custodian of them. And
there was no general, exploratolry search: Only the contraband coupons were demanded; only coupons were
taken.
These facts distinguished this case from such cases as
Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313, where officers without a search warrant swoop down on a private residence,
obtain admission through the exertion of official pressure,
and seize private property. The filling station was a
place of business, not a private residence. The officers'
claim to the property was one of right. For the coupons
which they demanded to see were government property.
And the demand was made during business hours. Whatever may be the limits of inspection under the regulations,
law enforcement is not so impotent as to require officers,
who have the right to inspect a place of business, to stand

mute when such clear evidence of criminal activity is
known to them.
Where the officers seek to inspect public documents at
the place of business where they are required to be kept,
permissible limits of persuasion are not so narrow as where
private papers are sought. The demand is one of right.
When the custodian is persuaded by argument that it
is his duty to surrender them and he hands them over,
duress and coercion will not be so readily implied as where
private papers are involved. The custodian in this situation is not protecied against the production of incriminating documents. Wilson v. Unitet States, supra. The
strict test of consent, designed to protect an accused
against production of incriminating evidence, has no place
here. The right of privacy, of course, remains. But, as
.we have said, the filling station was a place of business,
not a private residence. The right to inspect, existed.
And Where one is seeking to reclaim his property which
is unlawfully in the possession of another, the normal
restraints against intrusion on one's privacy, as we have
seen, are relaxed. The District Court found, after hearing
the witnesses, that petitioner consented-that although
he at first refused to turn the coupons over, he soon was
persuaded to do so and that force or threat of force was
not employed to persuade him. According to the District
Court, the officers "persuaded him that it would be a
better thing for him to permit them to examine" the
- coupons; "they talked him into it."
We cannot say as
a matter of law that that finding was erroneous. The
public character of the property, the fact that the demand
was made during business hours at the place of business
where the coupons were required to be kept, the existence
of the right to inspect, the nature of the request, the fact
that the initial refusal to turn the coupons over was soon
followed by acquiescence in the demand-these circum-

and seizure incidental to the arrest were reasonable.

MURPHY concurs, dissenting.

In its surface aspects this case concerns merely a squalid
effort to evade the wartime system of gasoline rationing.
But it should not be disposed of in that perspective. It
is not the first petty little case to put to the test respect
for principles which the founders of this nation deemed
essential for a free society. For the case is directly related
to one of the great chapters in the historic process whereby
civil liberty was achieved and constitutionally protected
against future inroads.
The Court's decision, as I see it, presents this issue:
May papers which an accused could not be compelled to
produce even by a judicial process of a search warrant be
taken from him against his will by officers of the law
without such judicial process for use as evidence in a
criminal prosecution against him? Judicial process may
not compel the production of documents either because
of the protection of the Fifth Amendment against selfcrimination, or, as in this case, because the authorization
by Congress of search warrants is withheld in a situation
like the present.' The Court apparently rules that because the gasoline business was subject to regulation, the

and at a price greater than that authorized by the Office of Price
Administration ceilings; he was prosecuted for the illegal possession

search and seizure of such documents without a warrant
is not an unreasonable search and seizure condemned by
the Fourth Amendment. To hold that the search in this
case was legal is to hold that a search which could not
be justified under a search warrant is lawful without it.
I cannot escape the conviction that such a view of the
Fourth Amendment makes a travesty of it and of the long
course of legislation in which Congress applied thst
Amendment.
Where search is made under the authority of a warrant
issued from a judicial source, the scope of the search must
be confined to the specific authorization of the warrant.
It cannot be that the Constitution meant to make it legally
advantageous not to have a warrant, so that the police
may roam freely and have the courts retrospectively hold
that the search that was made was "reasonable," reasonableness being judged from the point of view of obtaining
relevant evidence. I had supposed that that was precisely what the Fourth Amendment was meant to stop.
"The Government could desire its possession only to use
it as evidence against the defendant and to search for and
seize it for such purpose was unlawful." Gouled v. United
States, 255 U. S. 298, 310.
There is indeed a difference between private papers and
papers having also a public bearing. Private papers of
an accused cannot be seized even through legal process
because their use would violate the prohibition of the
Fifth Amendment against self-crimination. So-called
public papers-papers in which the public has an interest
of gasoline ration documents. These offenses are misdemeanors. 56
Stat. 176, 179, 50 U. S. C. App. § 633 (5).
The Espionage Act limits the issuance of search warrants to those
in which the property sought was stolen or embezzled, used as a
means of committing a felony, or used to aid illegally a foreign nation.
40 Stat. 217, 228, 18 U. S. C. § 612. The documents involved in this
case do not come within any of these categories.

other than that which they may serve as evidence in a
case-may be seized, but like all other things in an individual's possession they can be seized only upon a properly safeguarded search. The amenability of corporate
papers to testimonial compulsion means that a corporation, because it is a corporation, cannot make claim to
the privilege of self-crimination. Nor can the custodian
of corporate books immunize them against their production in court because they may also carry testimony
against him. The Fourth Amendment does not give freedom from testimonial compulsion. Subject to familiar
qualifications every man is under obligation to give testimony. But that obligation can be exacted only under
judicial sanctions which are deemed precious to AngloAmerican civilization. Merely because there may be the
duty to make documents available for litigation does not
mean that police officers may forcibly or fraudulently
obtain them. This protection of the right to be let alone
except under responsible judicial compulsion is precisely
what the Fourth Amendment meant to express and to
safeguard.
An even more fundamental issue lurks in the Court's
opinion if a casual but explicit phrase about the locus
of the search and seizure as "a place of business, not a
private residence" is intended to carry relevant legal
implications. If this is an indirect way of saying that
the Fourth Amendment only secures homes against unreasonable searches and seizures but not offices-private
offices of physicians and lawyers, of trade unions and
other organizations, of business and scientific enterprisesthen indeed it would constitute a sudden and drastic break
with the whole history of the Fourth Amendment and
its applications by this Court. See Olmstead v. United
States, 277 U. S. 438, 477, and cases cited in footnotes
5, 6, and 7. I cannot believe that a vast area of civil

liberties was thus meant to be wiped out by a few words,
without prior argument or consideration.
The course of decision in this Court has thus far jealously enforced the principle of a free society secured by
the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Its
safeguards are not to be worn away by a process of devitalizing interpretation. The approval given today to what
was done by arresting officers in this case indicates that
we are in danger of forgetting that the Bill of Rights
reflects experience with police excesses. It is not only
under Nazi rule that police excesses are inimical to freedom. It is easy to make light of insistence on scrupulous
regard for the safeguards of civil liberties when invoked
on behalf of the unworthy. It is too easy. History bears
testimony that by such disregard are the rights of liberty
extinguished, heedlessly at first, then stealthily, and
brazenly in the end.
The issue in this case is part of a long historic process
and proper consideration of the problem before us compels
rather extended discussion. These are the circumstances
that give rise to our problem. For some time operations
of the gasoline station owned by Davis under a corporate
form had been suspect by the Office of Price Administration. On the day of the questioned seizure, three 0. P. A.
investigators and two New York City detectives kept
watch on the station for several hours. One of the O. P. A.
men drove his car to the pumps for gas. After the attendant had filled his tank. he told her, when asked for coupons,
that he had none. She then demanded a higher price for
the gasoline which he paid with a marked five dollar bill.
Later, another investigator repeated this performance.
Then all five officers went into the station, notified the
attendant that she was under arrest, and requested and
obtained from her the two marked bills and a card on
which she had recorded the sales. While the girl's ques-

tioning was still proceeding, Davis drove into the station.
His car was immediately searched and he was charged
with selling gas over ceiling prices. and without coupons.
These were charges of misdemeanors. The officers then
demanded and received from Davis keys for the locked
boxes on the pumps intended for the deposit of coupons
received for gas sold. While some of the officers were
engaged in checking the discrepancy between the amount
of gas in storage tanks and the coupons in the boxes, Davis
was taken by two of the agents to an outer room in his
office. They demanded from him gas coupons which he
claimed to have in sufficient numbers to make up the
deficiencies in the locked boxes. He stubbornly refused
despite the insistence of one of the officers that "he would
have to open that door" to his private office. Finally,
when another officer flashed a light into the office from
an outside window and evinced an intention to force the
window, Davis unlocked the door. Thereupon he took
some envelopes from a filing cabinet and handed them to
the agents. These envelopes contained the stamps which
formed the basis of the prosecution. He was then taken
to 0. P. A. headquarters and questioned, but eventually
allowed to go. Several weeks later he was taken into
custody and then charged with the illegal possession
of gasoline ration documents. This charge also is a
misdemeanor.
The petitioner made timely motions for the suppression
of the evidence, see Nardone v. United States, 308 U. S.
338, 341-42, claiming that they were illegally seized and
barred as evidence against him. The trial court denied
these motions on the ground that Davis had voluntarily
turned the stamps over to the officers. The Circuit Court
of Appeals sustained the conviction but it did not accept
the District Court's view that Davis had surrendered the
stamps of his own free will. What the Circuit Court of
Appeals thought about the matter is best expressed in

DAVIS v. UNITED STATES.

its own language: "The judge found that Davis' consent
was 'voluntarily' given, and for that reason denied the
motion to suppress the evidence. We need not decide
that that finding is wrong, for we can dispose of the case
upon other grounds; but we must own to some doubt
whether a consent obtained under such circumstances
should properly be regarded as 'voluntary.' Davis must
have known, under arrest as he was, that the officers were
not likely to stand very long upon ceremony, but in one
way or another, would enter the office." 151 F. 2d 140,
142. One must reject the District Court's finding that
Davis' consent went with his surrender of the documents
unless one is to hold that every submission to the imminent
exertion of superior force is consensual if force is'not
physically applied. The District Court's finding that
Davis voluntarily surrendered the documents is not one
of those findings of facts which appropriately calls for
our acceptance. When such a finding involves conflicting
evidence or the credibility of a witness, the advantage
of having seen or heard a witness may be decisive. But
here the issue is not as to what took place but as to the
significance of what took place. And when a district
court's finding of a so-called fact is as interwoven as it
is here with constitutional consequences, we cannot accept
a finding whereby the constitutional issue is predetermined. We are not bound by findings that operate as
cryptic constitutional determinations even when they
come here, unlike the present case, supported by both
lower courts. See United States v. Appalachian Power
Co., 311 U. S. 377, 404. To say that a yielding to continuous pressure by arresting officers, accompanied by
minatory manifestations to resort to self-help, constitutes
a voluntary yielding, is to disregard ordinary experience.
This Court preferred not to do that in Amos v. United
States, 255 U. S. 313. We there held that where officers
stated that they were revenue officers and requested ad-

mission to the premises in order to make a search, there
was, as a matter of law, "implied coercion." Inasmuch
"as conduct under duress involves a choice," the Fourth
Amendment is hardly to be nullified by finding every
submission short of overpowering force "voluntary." See
Union Pacific R. Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 248 U. S.
67, 70.
This Court also attributes voluntariness to Davis' surrender of the documents. But it does so not because it
finds that what Davis did was an exercise of free choice.
It does not question the doubt of the Circuit Court of
Appeals whether the consent obtained from Davis was,
as a psychological fact, a voluntary act. The Court derives voluntariness from the fact that what the officers
compelled Davis to give up were ration coupons. But,
surely, thin is to assign to ordinary words a private, esoteric
meaning. Common usage rejects such meaning of "voluntary" and law has not heretofore indulged it. In considering whether evidence was freely given or coerced, the
law has always meant by "voluntary" what everybody
else means by it. To make voluntariness turn on the
nature of theQuest, instead of on the nature of the response
of the person in control of the sought documents, is to
distort familiar notions on the basis of which the law
has heretofore adjudged legal consequences. The Court
accepts the Government's argument 2 which the Circuit

Court of Appeals rejected, and rejected because gravely
disturbed by its implication. Though differently phrased,
the argument which has here found favor evoked this
comment in the concurring opinion of Judge Frank: "I
add a few words only because I think it important to
underscore our rejection of the following argument on
which the Assistant United States Attorney chiefly relied:
Whenever the government validly regulates any business
and includes in its regulation a valid requirement that
records be kept which shall be open to official inspection,
then refusal to produce the records for such inspection
authorizes the officers to enter the premises and seize the
records. One variant of the argument was that refusal
to permit inspection in such circumstances constitutes, in
effect, the legal equivalent of consent to enter; another
variant was that, in such circumstances, conduct of the
defendant must be interpreted as consent to entry
although, in other circumstances, the very same conduct
would be regarded as refusal. In one way or another,
the Assistant United States Attorney urged that obstruction of the right of the officers to inspect deprived the
there was a wrongful taking; the court admitted the evidence procured
as a result of the inspection, but barred the documents from evidence);
C. M. Spring Drug Co. v. United States, 12 F. 2d 852; United States
v. Kempe, 59 F Supp. 905; Bowles v. Stitzinger, 59 F. Supp. 94;
Bowles v. Curtiss Candy Co., 55 F. Supp. 527; United States v. Sherry,
294 F. 684 (here the documents were taken with the consent of the
custodian). In A. Guckenheimer & Bros. Co. v. United States,
3 F. 2d 786, however, the situation bears some resemblance to the
present case. There the Circuit Court of Appeals attributed the
consent of the custodian, following continual refusal, to the command
of the statute. While there was no indication, as evidenced by the
opinion, that the documents were secured through fear of force, the
inspection afforded was probably not voluntary. Insofar as there
is support in that case for a search that transgressed the Fourth
Amendment, the observations are mere dicta, since no timely objec-

tion was filed.

defendant of his usual privilege to be free of unreasonable
search and seizure." 151 F. 2d at 144.
Of course there is an important difference in the constitutional protection afforded their possessors between
papers exclusively private and documents having public
aspects. Cf. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 39394; Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298, 308-309. But
the essence of the difference is that under appropriate
circumstances wholly private papers are not even subject
to testimonial compulsion whereas other papers, once
they have been legally obtained, are available as evidence.
Had the coupons in controversy been secured by a proper
search they could be used against the defendant at the
trial. But their character does not eliminate the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment and subject the person
in possession of such documents, against his protest, to
searches and seizures othtrwise unwarranted.
The acceptance of the Government's argument opens
an alarming vista of inroads upon the right of privacy.
This right the Fourth Amendment sought to protect by
its general interdiction of police intrusion without prior
judicial authorization through search warrants issued
"upon probable cause, supported by Oath or afflrmation,
and particularly describing the place to be searched, and
the persons or things to be seized." Amendment IV.
Only the other day every person not in the armed forces
had in his possession 0. P. A. documents which technically
were the property of the 0. P. A., and the same situation
may come to pass tomorrow; most businesses in the country are in possession of documents required to be kept
under federal and State authority; and there is every prospect that this network of required records will be extended.
It misconceives the issues to assume that the protection
for privacy here urged would serve as a shield against
scrutiny of the records of the giant industries or the great
trade unions. The Fourth Amendment does not differ-

entiate between big and small enterprise. But, in any
event, while our economy is extensively carried on through
the corporate form, the latest available figures show that
of the multitudinous income-reporting corporations only
about five per cent have a net income above $100,000.
It cannot be that the highly prized constitutional immunity from police intrusion, as it affects activities that
permeate our national life, is now to be curtailed or viewed
with laxity.
The Court's opinion has only its own reasoning to support it. Nothing that this Court has ever decided or
sanctioned gives it strength. Wilson v. United States,
221 U. S. 361, invoked by the Court was a very different
story. That case was concerned with the difference between the amenability of a corporation to testimonial
compulsion and the immunity of an individual, under
relevant circumstances, to be free from the duty to give
testimony. The core of the Government's claim here is
the right to seize documents in the absence of judicial
process. The difference between demanding documents
without legal process and seizing them on the basis of
such process, is the difference between the protection of
civil liberties and their invasion. The difference is the
essence of the Fourth Amendment.
Indeed, so unhappy was the experience with police
search for papers and articles "in home or office," Gouled
v. United States, 255 U. S. 298, 308, 309, that it was once
maintained that no search and seizure is valid. To Lord
Coke has been attributed the proposition that warrants
could not be secured even for stolen property. But see
Coke, Fourth Institute, 176-77. Under early English
doctrine even search warrants by appropriate authority
could issue only for stolen goods. See 2 Hale, Pleas of
the Crown, 113-14, 149-51; 2 Gabbett, Criminal Law
(1843) 156 et seq.; 1 Chitty, Criminal Law (5th ed., 1847)

seq.; 1 Archbold, Criminal Procedure (7th ed., 1860) 141.
Certainly warrants lacking strict particularity as to location to be searched or articles to be seized were deemed
obnoxious. Ibid.; see also 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown,
130, 133. An attempt to exceed these narrow limits called
forth the enduring judgment of Lord Camden, in Entick
v. Carrington, 19 Howell's State Trials 1029, in favor of
freedom against police intrusions. And when appeal to
the colonial courts on behalf of these requisite safeguards
for the liberty of the people failed, Paxton's Case, Quincy
(Mass.) 51, a higher tribunal resolved the issue. The
familiar comment of John Adams on Otis' argument in
Paxton's Case can never become stale: "American independence was then and there born; the seeds of patriots
and heroes were then and there sown, to defend the vigorous youth, the non sine Diis animosus infans. Every
man of a crowded audience appeared to me to go away,
as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.
Then and there was the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then
and there the child Independence was born. In fifteen
years, namely in 1776, he grew up to manhood, and declared himself free." 10 Adams, Works, 247-248; for a
description of Otis' speech in Paxton's Case, see 2 id. 523.
So basic to liberty is the protection against governmental
search and seizure, that every State in the Union ' has
this as a constitutional safeguard.
This bleak recital of the past was living experience for
Madison and his collaborators. They wrote that experience into the Fourth Amendment, not merely its words.
Mention has been made of the doubt in the minds of
English and Colonial libertarians whether searches and

seizures could be sanctioned even by search warrants. It
is significant that Madison deemed it necessary to put
into the Fourth Amendment a qualifying permission for
search and seizure by the judicial process of the search
warrant-a search warrant exacting in its foundation and
limited in scope. This qualification gives the key to what
the framers had in mind by prohibiting "unreasonable"
searches and seizures. The principle was that all seizures
without judicial authority were deemed "unreasonable."
If the purpose of its framers is to be respected, the meaning of the Fourth Amendment must be distilled from
contemporaneous history. The intention of the Amendment was accurately elucidated in an early Massachusetts
case. The court there had before it the terms of the Massachusetts Constitution, on which, with like provisions
in other State Constitutions, the Fourth Amendment was
based:
"With the fresh recollection of .those stirring discussions [respecting writs of assistance], and of the revolution which followed them, the article in the Bill
of Rights, respecting searches and seizures, was
franled and adopted. This article does not prohibit
all searches and seizures of a man's person, his papers,
and possessions; but such only as are 'unreasonable,'
and the foundation of which is 'not previously supported by oath or affirmation.' The legislature were
not deprived of the power to authorize search warrants for probable causes, supported by oath or affirmation, and for the punishment or suppression of
any violation of law. The law, therefore, authorizing
search warrants in certain cases, is in no respect inconsistent with the declaration of rights." Commonwealth v. Dana, 2 Met. (Mass.) 329, 336.
Such was the contemporaneous construction of the
Fourth Amendment by the Congress. It gave specific

authorization whenever it wished to permit searches and
seizures. Beginning with the first Congress down to 1917,
Congress authorized search by warrant not as a generally
available resource in aid of criminal prosecution but in
the most restricted way, observing with a jealous eye the
recurrence of evils with which our early statesmen were
intimately familiar. For each concrete situation Congress
deemed it necessary to pass a separate act. An incomplete
examination finds scores of such ad hoc enactments scattered through the Statutes at Large. Not until 1917, and
then only after repeated demands by the Attorney CG-eral, did Congress pass the present statute authorizing
the issue of search warrants for generalized situations.
40 Stat. 217, 228, 18 U, S. C. §§ 611 et seq. Even then
the situations were restricted and the scope of the authority was strictly defined. In the case before us no attempt
was made to get a search warrant because none could
have been got. Congress did not authorize one either
on the charges on which Davis was originally arrested or
on which he was. ultimately tried. And even since the
1917 Act Congress has emphasized the importance of
basing the compulsory demand for evidence upon judicial
process rather than the zeal of arresting officers. The
habit of continual watchfulness against the dangers of
police abuses has been reflected in that Congress has continued to authorize search warrants for particular situations by specific legislation or by reference to the 1917
Act. These revealing enactments are summarized in an
Appendix.
In the course of its decisions, with a deviation promptly
retraced, this Court has likewise reflected the broad purpose of the Fourth Amendment. The historic reach of
the Amendment and the duty to observe it was expounded
for the Court by Mr. Justice Bradley in Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616, "a case that will be remembered
as long as civil liberty lives in the United States."

Brandeis, J., in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438,
471, at 474. The Amendment has not been read in a
niggardly spirit or with the outlook of a narrow-minded
lawyer.
Since the opinion in this case seems to me out of line
with our prior decisions, it becomes important to recall
how this Court has heretofore viewed the Fourth Amendment and what has actually been decided. I shall draw
on a summary, of the Court's decisions by Mr. Justice
Brandeis:
"Time and again, this Court in giving effect to the
principle underlying the Fourth Amendment, has
refused to place an unduly literal construction upon
it. This was notably illustrated in the Boyd case
itself. Taking language in its ordinary meaning,
there is no 'search' or 'seizure' when a defendant is
required to produce a document in the orderly process
of a court's procedure. 'The right of the people to
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures,' would not
be violated, under any ordinary construction of language, by compelling obedience to a subpoena. But
this Court holds the evidence inadmissible simply
because the information leading to the issue of the
subpoena has been unlawfully secured. Silverthorne
Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385. Literally, there is no 'search' or 'seizure' when a friendly
visitor abstracts papers from an office; yet we held
in Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S.298, that evidence so obtained could not be used. No court which
looked at the words of the Amendment rather than
at its underlying purpose would hold, as this Court
did in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733, that its
protection extended to letters in the mails. The provision against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment has been given an equally broad construction.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
F ANKFURTER,

328 U. S.

The language is: 'No person . . shall be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'
Yet we have held, not only that the protection of
the Amendment extends to a witness before a grand
jury, although- he has not been charged with crime,
Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 562, 586,
but that: 'It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject
to criminal responsibility him who gives it. The
privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does
one who is also a party defendant.' McCarthy v.
Arndstein, 266 U.. S. 34, 40. The narrow language
of the Amendment has been consistently construed
in the light of its object, 'to insure that a person should
not be compelled, when acting as a witness in any
investigation, to give testimony which might tend
to show that he himself had committed a crime. The
privilege is limited to criminal matters, but it is as
broad as the mischief against which it seeks to guard.'
Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra, p. 562.
"Decisions of this Court applying the principle of
the Boyd case have settled these things. Unjustified
search and seizure violates the Fourth Amendment,
whatever the character of the paper; whether the
paper when taken by the federal officers was in the
home, in an office or elsewhere; whether the taking
was effected by force, by fraud, or in the orderly process of a court's procedure. From these decisions, it
follows necessarily that the Amendment is violated
by the officer's reading the paper without a physical
seizure, without his even touching it; and that use,
in any criminal proceeding, of the contents of the
papers so examined-as where they are testified to
by a federal officer who thus saw the document or
where, through knowledge so obtained, a copy has
been procured elsewhere-any such use constitutes

a violation of the Fifth Amendment." Olmstead v.
United States, 277 U. S.438, 471, at 476-478.
And so we are finally brought to the question whether
the seizure of documents which could not possibly have
been justified as the result of a search under a warrant,
since no such warrant could have been authorized by law,
can be justified as a search and seizure without a warrant.
Such' justification must have some historic foundation,
otherwise it is clearly out of the bounds of the Fourth
Amendment. The court below evidently struggled in
reaching its conclusion because of some decisions here
which it naturally found "not entirely harmonious." Its
chief reliance was language in Marron v. United States,
275 U. S. 192. A short answer would be that the sting
of the Marroncase was taken by two later cases. Go-Bart
Co. v. United States, 282 U. S.344, 358, and United States
v.*Lefkowitz, 285 U. S.452, 465. But a closer analysis is
called for.

One would expect a hard-headed system like the common law to recognize exceptions even to the most comprehensive principle for safeguarding liberty. This is true
of the prohibition of all searches and seizures as unreasonable unless authorized by a judicial warrant appropriately
supported. Such is the exception, historically well recognized, of the right to seize without warrant goods and
papers on ships or other moving vehicles. Another exception is the right of searching the person upon arrest.
Whether that right is a surviving incident of the historic
role of the "hue and cry" in early Anglo-Saxon law, see
People v. Chiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 196, 142 N. E. 583, or
is based on the necessity of depriving the prisoner of potential means of escape, Closson v. Morrison,47 N. H. 482,
or on preventing the prisoner from destroying evidence
otherwise proper'ly subject to seizure, see Reifsnyder v.
Lee, 44 Iowa 101, 103; Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527,

arrest was early settled in our law.' 1 Bishop, New Criminal Procedure (4th ed., 1895) §§ 210 et seq,.
A casual and uncritical application of this right to search
the person of the prisoner has led some decisions in the
lower federal courts to an unwarranted expansion of this
narrow exception, with resulting inroads upon the overriding principle of the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment. Slight extensions from case to case gradually
attain a considerable momentum from "judicial sanction
of equivocal methods, which, regarded superficially, may
seem to escape the challenge of illegality but which, in
reality, strike at the substance of the constitutional right."
' For purposes of present discussion, the validity of the arrest has
been assumed. But its legality raises several serious questions. First,
it is not clear whether the 0. P. A. investigators or the New York City

detectives made the arrest. The 0. P. A. investigators, of course,
have no authorization to make an arrest. Whether the New York
detectives are authorized to make arrests for federal offenses is a
debatable issue. See Gambino v. United States, 275 U. S. 310; Marsh
v. United States, 29 F. 2d 172; § 20 (a) of the Emergency Price Con-

trol Act, 56 Stat. 23, 29, 50 U. S. C. App. § 921. Though local law
makes provision for punishment of the same acts that are federal
offenses in this regard, N. Y. Laws, 1942, c. 544, the arrest was made
for a federal and not a state or local offense. If the New York law is
controlling as to the validity of the arrest, however, it is within the
power of any person to make an arrest for a crime, including a misdemeanor, in his presence. The common law rule restricted arrest
without warrant for a misdemeanor to those acts which were breaches
of the peace. Here again, there is the issue of whether the petitioner
committed any misdemeanor in the presence of those making the arrest
at the time the arrest was made. A recent decision by the English
Court of Appeal focuses attention on this last question. In Leachinsky v. Christie (1945), [1946] 1 K. B. 124, at 135, Lord Justice Scott
makes clear why the legality of arrest turns on the justification which
the arresting officer gives at the time of the arrest: "The law does
not allow an arrest in vacuo, or without reason assigned, and the
reason assigned must be that the arrest is for the purpose of a prosecution on the self-same charge, as is the justification for the arrest.
It follows, and it is a principle lying at the very roots of English free-

Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28, 33-34. In cases
dealing with the search of the person,5 it is natural to
speak of the right to search and seize things "in his possession" without strict regard to the ambiguous scope of
a man's "possession." From that, opinions slide readily
to including the right to search and seize things "within
the immediate control" of the arrested person, language
appropriate enough when applied to goods which the
arrested person was transporting at the time. Taken
out of their original context, these phrases are used until
they are made to include the entire premises' in which
doam, that if a man is arrested on one charge he is entitled to his release
the moment the prosecution of that charge is abandoned. The prosecution cannot arrest on one charge, abandon their intention to proceed
on that charge and then keep him in cold storage, still nominally on
that charge, while they inquire into the possibility of putting forward
a different charge. To do that they must first release him: then,
when they propose to put forward some other charge, they can make
that new charge the occasion of a new arrest." See also Dumbell v.
Roberts (1944), 113 L. J. (K. B.) 185; People v. Marendi, 213 N. Y.
600, 609 et seq., 107 N. E. 1058. The Law Quarterly Review, in commenting on the Leachinsky case, pointed out: "An accused person

has a right to know what the charge is against him so that, if he elects
to speak, he may have a fair and open chance of clearing himself at

the earliest moment." 62 L. Q. Rev. at 4. It is to be noted that
Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 157, assumes the federal law

of arrest to be the same as that of the English.

the arrest takes place. Another factor enters. This language is sometimes used in cases involving the seizure of
items properly subject to seizure because in open view at
the time of arrest.8 But this last confusion is due to a
failure to distinguish between the appropriate scope of
a search on arrest and the very different problem as to
the right of seizure where no search is in question.
It is important to keep clear the distinction between
prohibited searches on the one hand and improper seizures
on the other. See Mr. Justice Miller, in Boyd v. United
States, 116 U. S. 616, 638, 641. Thus, it is unconstitutional to seize a person's private papers, though the search
in which they were recovered was perfectly proper. E. g.,
Gouled v. United States, 255 U. S. 298. It is unconstitutional to make an improper search even for articles that
are appropriately subject to seizure, e. g., Amos v. United
States, 2'55 U. S. 313; Byars v. United States, 273 U. S.
28; Taylor v. United States, 286 U. S. 1. And a search
may be improper because of the object it seeks to uncover,
e. g., W7eeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 393-94, or
because its scope extends beyond the constitutional
bounds, e. g., Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20.
The course of decisions here has observed these important distinctions. The Court has not been indulgent
towards inroads upon the Amendment. Only rarely have
its dicta appeared to give undue scope to the right of
search on arrest, and Marron v. United States, supra, is
the only decision in which the dicta were reflected in the
result. That case has been a source of confusion to the

lower courts.. Thus, the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit felt that the Marron case required it
to give a more restricted view to the prohibitions of the
Fourth Amendment than that court had expounded in
United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F. 2d.202, see Go-Bart
Co. v. United States, sub nom., United States v. Gowen,
40 F. 2d 593, only to find itself reversed here, Go-Bart Co.
v. United States, supra, partly on the authority of the
Kirschenblatt decision which, after the Matron case, it
thought it must disown. The uncritical application of
the right of search on arrest in the Marron case has surely
been displaced by Go-Bart Co. v. United States, supra,
and even more drastically by United States v. Lejkowitz,
supra, unless one is to infer that an earlier case qualifies
later decisions although these later decisions have explicitly confined the earlier case.
In view of the jealousy with which this Court has
applied the protection of the Fourth Amendment even
where the search purported to take place under a proper
warrant and there was the safeguard of judicial process
in addition to the expressed judgment of the enforcement
officials, see e. g., Grau v. United States, 287 U. S. 124;
Sgro v. United States, 287 U. S. 206, it was not to be
expected that this Court should sanction searches on arrest
that can be justified as reasonable only if securing evidence
for purposes of the trial is the test of rea&onableness for
purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Such a view presupposes that the Fourth Amendment is obsolete and
makes of the particularity of requirement for search warrants a mocking redundancy.
A final point. In this case the arrest was based on
two misdemeanors, the sale of gasoline.without the requisite coupons and the sale of gasoline at a price over the
0. P. A. ceilings. For neither of these offenses were
coupons "instruments of the crime" in any sense in which

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

that term is properly used. The exceptional right to
search on arrest does not in any event extend to a search
for articles necessary to the commission of a crime other
than that for which the arrest was made. The officers
could not have made an arrest of Davis for illegal possession of coupons, for which he was later tried, on mere
suspicion. That crime, like the others, was only a misdemeanor, and no arrest can be made for a misdemeanor
without a warrant unless it be committed in the presence
of officers. Prior to the search, the officers had no basis
for stating that he was committing the crime of illegal
possession of the coupons in their presence.
It is too often felt, though not always avowed, that
what is called nice observance of these constitutional safeguards makes apprehension and conviction of violators
too difficult. Want of alertness and enterprise on the
part of the law enforcers too often is the real obstruction

to law enforcement. The present case affords a good
instance.' The situation bears close resemblance to what
9

The pe -ioner's gas station was under suspicion for some weeks;
yet action was finally taken as described in this inion. Petitioner
was arrested when he arrived at the gas station for sales above ceiling
prices and sales without coupons. No arraignment was made for
these offenses-instead the officers engaged in a se..rch of the premises, which included the essentially forced entry into the petitioner's
office. He was then taken to the local 0. P. A. headquarters. After
several hours of questioning at 0. P. A. headquarters, Davis was
released. Not until one month later was the petitioner re-arrested
and arraigned, and then on a charge entirely different from those
on which the original arrest was made. The Emergency Price Control
Act, 56 Stat. 23, 50 U. S. C. App. §§ 901 et seq., made adequate
provision for effective enforcement of the statute. So far as securing
documents and papers are concerned, the Administrator is equipped
with the subpoena power, § 202 (c), (d), (e); in addition, the Administrator has the power to seek injuncfion against the acts which the
petitioner was accused of committing, § 205 (a); and by appropriate
proceedings the Administrator may seek the withdrawal of the license
which the petitioner required to operate his business, § 205 (f).

Judge Learned Hand said on another occasion. "We are
told that unless such evidence will serve, it will be impossible to suppress an evil of large proportion in the residential part of Brooklyn. Perhaps so; any community
must choose between the impairment of its power to punish crime and such evils as arise from its uncontrolled
prosecution. But the danger is not certain, for the officers
could have applied for a warrant which-as was at least
intimated in Taylor v. United States-might then have
been valid. It takes time to break up a still and take
the parts away; if the attempt were made, it would discover itself immediately. One or more officers could have
watched, while the others went to a judge or commissioner,
whose action would at least have put a different face upon
their subsequent proceedings." United States v. Kaplan,
89 F. 2d 869, 871.
The Court in this case gives a new label to an old practice and to an old claim by police officials. But it happens
that the old practice and the old claim now refurbished
in a new verbal dress were the very practice and claim
which infringed liberty as conceived by those who framed
the Constitution and against which they erected the barriers of the Fourth Amendment. I am constrained to
believe that today's decision flows from a view of the
Fourth Amendment that is unmindful of the history that
begot it and of the purpose for which it was included in
the Bill of Rights. And the view of the Amendment
which the Court rejects is confirmed by an impressive body
of the laws of Congress and of the decisions of this Court.
Stern enforcement of the criminal law is the hallmark of
a healthy and self-confident society. But in our democracy such enforcement presupposes a moral atmosphere
and a reliance upon intelligence whereby the effective
administration of justice can be achieved with due regard
for those civilized standards in the use of the criminal law
which are formulated in our Bill of Rights. If great prin-

ciples sometimes appear as finicky obstructions in bringing a criminal to heel, this admonition of a wise judge gives
the final answer: "Such constitutional limitations arise
from grievances, real or fancied, which their makers have
suffered, and should go pari passu with the supposed evil.
They withstand the winds of logic by the depth and toughness of their roots in the past. Nor should we forget that
what seems fair enough against a squalid huckster of bad
liquor may take on a very different face, if used by a government determined to suppress political opposition under
the guise of sedition." Learned Hand, J., in United States

*Congress has passed numerous statutes authorizing inspection of
defined premises knd seizures without warrants. These are all very
particularized acts, relating mostly to the inspection of vessels and
vehicles and the seizure of various types of contraband goods. Most
of this legislation comes within the exceptions historically recognized
at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment as to recapture
of stolen goods and search of vehicles and vessels because of their
fugitive nature. In such a mass of legislation, it would not .be surprising if some of the specific acts fell afoul of the considerations which
invalidated the legislation in the Boyd case. 116 U. S. 616. What
is significant about this legislation is the recognition by Congress of
the necessity for specific Congressional authorization even for the
search of vessels and other moying vehicles and the seizures of goods
technically contraband.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE,

dissenting.

I am substantially in accord with the views expressed
by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER in his exhaustive opinion as
to the controlling principles which should govern in the
disposition of this case. Perhaps it should be added that
the evidence does not clearly show that the' officer who
flashed the light into the window was in fact attempting
to open it by force or to do more than observe the interior.
But the situation was such that his action clearly created
in Davis' mind the impression that he either was entering
by force or intended to do so. It therefore must be taken,
I think, that Davis' so-called consent was induced by this
apparent compulsion, the very kind of thing the Fourth
Amendment was designed to prevent. There was no such
consent as would legalize the entry and search.
Moreover, whatever may be the scope of search incident
to lawful arrest for a misdemeanor, I know of no decision
which goes so far as to rule that this right of search extends
to breaking and entering locked premises by force. That
was not done here. But the search followed on consent
given in the reasonable belief that it was necessary to
avoid the breaking and entry. I think it was therefore
in no better case legally than if in fact the breaking and
forceable entry had occurred. The search was justified
neither by consent nor by the doctrine of reasonable search
as incident to a lawful arrest.
