v. PORTER, kP.Kku

-

ADMINISTRATOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE EMERGENCY COURT OF APPEALS.

No. 393.

Argued February 26, 1946.-Decided April 22, 1946.

1. The decision of this case on the merits is governed by Utah Junk
Co. v. Porter,ante, p. 39. P. 49.
2. While a suit for treble damages under § 205 (e) of the Emergency
Price Control Act was pending in the District Court against peti-

tioners, they filed with the Price Administrator a protest under
§ 203 (a) seeking to have the regulation on which the enforcement
proceeding was based declared invalid or inapplicable. The protest was dismissed by the Price Administrator, and petitioners'
ensuing complaint in the Emergency Court of Appeals was dismissed
by that court without opinion. Upon a complaint filed by leave of
the District Court under § 204 (e) of the Act, the Emergency Curt
of Appeals sustained the validity of the regulation but refused to
pass on its applicability to petitioners. Held that the judgment of
the Emergency Court of Appeals dismissing the complaint in the
protest proceeding under § 203 (a) was not rendered moot by its
judgment sustaining the validity of the regulation in the proceeding
under §204 (e). P. 48.
3. The fact that Congress by the 1944 amendment of the Emergency Price Control Act granted a limited opportunity for review
of a regulation by the Emergency Court of Appeals by leave of a
district court in which an enforcement proceeding is pending,
neither repealed nor qualified the protest proceeding originally
authorized by § 203 (a). The two methods of securing a hearing on
the validity and applicability of a price regulation are cumulative
and not alternative. P. 49.
4. A person against whom a treble damage suit for violation of a
regulation under the Emergency Price Control Act is pending, is a
"person subject to . . .such regulation" within the meaning of

§ 203 (a) of the Act, although the regulation has since been revoked
or superseded. United States v. Hark, 320 U. S. 531. P. 49.
Reversed.

Opinion of the Court.

Petitioners filed with the Price Administrator a protest
under the Emergency Price'Control Act. The Price Administrator denied the protest. The Emergency Court of
Appeals dismissed the petitioners' complaint. This Court
granted certiorari. 326 U. S. 710. Reversed, p. 49.
Mac Asbill argued the cause for petitioners. With him
on the brief were Allen P. Dodd, Sr. and Max O'Rell
Truitt.
Richard H. Field argued the cause for respondent.
With him on the brief were Solicitor General McGrath, John R. Benney, Jacob D. Hyman and John 0.
Honnold, Jr.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioners were stockholders in a distilling corporation
on the dissolution of which in December, 1942, they received as their share of the assets warehouse receipts covering the bulk whiskey owned by the corporation. Early
,in January, 1943, they. sold these receipts at a price above
that fixed by the Administrator for bulk whiskey, Maximum Price Regulation 193, 7 Fed. Reg. 6006 (August 4,
1942), on the assumption that the receipts constituted "securities" expressly exempt from the pricing provisions.
On the basis of the sale of these certificates the Administrator, under § 205 (e) of the Emergency Price Control
Act, 56 Stat. 23, 34; 50 U. S. C. App. § 925 (e), brought
a suit for treble damages against the petitioners to recover
approximately $6,800,000. That suit is still pending. In
May, 1945, petitioners, invoking the authority of
§ 203 (a), 56 Stat. 23, 31, 58 Stat. 632, 638; 50 U. S. C.
App. § 923 (a), sought to have the regulation on which
the enforcement proceedings against them were based de-

clared invalid or inapplicable by a protest filed with the
Administrator. He dismissed it on the authority of
Thomas Paper Stock Co. v. Bowles, 148 F. 2d 831, the
ruling of which we have reversed in Utah Junk Co. v.
Porter, decided this day, ante, p. 39. Petitioners then
went to the Emergency Court, which dismissed the complaint without opinion, and we granted certiorari. 326
U. S. 710. Prior to the petition for certiorari,petitioners
obtained leave of the trial court in the treble damage
action to file a complaint with the Emergency Court under
§ 204 (e) of the Act, 58 Stat. 632, 639, 50 U. S. C. App.
§ 925 (e), and on January 10, 1946, that court sustained
the validity of the regulation. Collins v. Bowles, 152
F. 2d 760.
The Government contends that the latter decision of
the Emergency Court renders moot the judgment of that
court dismissing the complaint, which is the only judgmen;, now before us. This Court is powerless to decide a
case if its decision "cannot affect the rights of the litigants
in the case before it." St. Pierrev. UnitedStates, 319 U. S.
41, 42. The decision of this case may affect the rights of
the litigants. The Emergency Court sustained the challenged regulation. It refused to pass on the applicability
of the regulation to the petitioners. It left that question
to the District Court before which the treble damage suit
is pending. Had petitioners' contentions come before the
Emergency Court through the protest proceedings under
§ 203 (a) that court would have adjudicated both issues.
Conklin Pen Co. v. Bowles, 152 F. 2d 764; Collins v.
Bowles, supra. And in the event that the Emergency
Court had found the regulation inapplicable and such decision had been made before a judgment was rendered in
the District Court, its ruling would be binding upon the
District Court. Under § 204 (e) (2) (ii), consideration
of a protest under § 203 (a) is hot a ground for staying the

Opinion of the Court.

proceedings in the District Court, since the protest proceeding did not precede the suit in the District Court; and
under the same provisions of the Act determination of the
protest proceeding under § 203 (a) can have no retroactive
effect once the District Court has entered its judgment.
But the opportunity foi7 securing a decision from the Emergency Court through the protest proceeding before a
judgment in the District Court is entered, has practical
significance and makes this a living and not a hypothetical
controversy.
On the merits the case is governed by our decision in
Utah Junk Co. v. Porter. The petitioners in this case
had a right to have their protests considered by the Administrator and, in case of denial, to resort to the Emergency Court of Appeals. The fact that Congress in 1944
gave a limited opportunity to go to the Emergency Court
by leave of the District Court before which an enforcement proceeding is pending, § 204 (e), neither repealed
nor qualified the protest proceeding originally designed
by § 203 (a). The two modes of securing a hearing on
the validity and applicability of the price regulation are
cumulative and not alternative. The Administrator advances no argument to distinguish the case from that of
Utah Junk Co. v. Porter. His contention that the petitioners are not persons "subject to . . . [the] regulation," § 203 (a), is amply refuted by the continuing
liability of the petitioners, United States v. Hark, 320
U. S. 531, for some $6,800,000, should their arguments as
to the invalidity and inapplicability of the regulation be
rejected when the case is considered on the merits.
It is superfluous to discuss other issues raised in this
case.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
