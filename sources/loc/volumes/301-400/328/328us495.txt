Apart from this defect, the instructions given were correct as far as they went. They were however in wholly
abstract form, which in some cases might be sufficient.

But the issues of premeditation and deliberation were
crucial here on the question of life or death. A more adequate charge, I agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

would have pointed up the evidence, at least in broad
outline, in relation to those issues.
Because I think the charge was deficient in not includ-

ing the requested instruction or one substantially similar,
thus in my opinion failing to meet the standard set by
Congress in the Code, and because the effect of this deficiency was magnified by the failure to point up the instructions given in some more definite relation to the evidence,
I think the judgment should be reversed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued March 5, 6, 1946.-Decided June 10, 1946.
During lengthy proceedings for the reorganization of a railroad under
§ 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, it realized abnormally large earnings
from war business. Most of these earnings were utilized to.fiiake
capital improvements and a large amount was held as free cash.
Meanwhile, the claims of secured creditors were increased substan-

tially by the accumulation of interest and the position of holders
of general mortgage bonds (the most junior lien holders) deteriorated 90%. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved a
plan of reorganization which eliminated the claims of all existing
stockholders and unsecured creditors, gave the holders of general
mortgage bonds new common stock in face amount of 10% of their
claims, and gave senior bondholders new securities (including about
88% of the new common stock) having an aggregate face value
equal to 100% of their claims. This was based upon a determination that the aggregate of the securities in the plan represented the
value of the properties for reorganization purposes and that, through
prospective earnings, there was adequate coverage for the charges.
The large accumulation of free cash was not distributed. The plan
was approved by the District Court and accepted by all creditors
entitled to vote except the holders of general mortgage bonds. The
District Court held that the latter's rejection of the plan was not
"reasonably justified" and confirmed the plan. Held:
1. The orders of the District Court approving and confirming the
plan are affirmed. P. 536.
2. Under § 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the experience and judgment of the Commission must be relied upon for final determinations of value and of matters affecting the public interest, subject
to judicial review to assure compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements. Ecker v. Western Pacific R. Co., 318 U. S. 448;
Group of Investors v. Milwaukee R. Co., 318 U. S. 523. P. 508.
3. The Courts are empowered to review the plan to determine
whether the Commission has followed the statutory mandates of
§ 77 (e) and had material evidence to support its conclusions. Id.
P. 509.
4. The congressional authorization for the Commission to eliminate valueless claims from participation in reorganization is a valid
exercise of the federal bankruptcy power. Id. P. 509.
5. The Commission's judgment that the earning prospect did
not justify a greater capitalization than the one given is controlling.
P. 515.
6. It was not required to add, and would not be justified in adding,
to the capitalized value the amount of expenditures for improvements made during the reorganization proceedings if, in the exercise
of sound discretion, it felt that the reasonable prospective earnings
of the road, after the improvements, did not justify it. P. 515.
7. There was ample evidence to justify the valuation made 'by
the Commission. Pp. 512-516.

8. The valuation having been based on earnings, the segregation
of the system earnings to each existing lien and the allocation of new
securities representing the system value to each class of claimants,
was in full accord with the principle that senior creditors are to retain their relative priority of position in a reorganization. P. 517.
9. Junior claims can receive nothing until senior claims receive
securities of a value equal to their indebtedness. P. 517.
10. When the Commission made its allocations of securities, it did
not find that the cash value of those awarded senior claimants
equalled the face value of their claims; and it definitely had in mind
that one thing that gave them compensation for the admission of
junior claimants to participation in securities before the seniors
obtained full cash payment was their chance to share in the unlimited dividends that might be earned and paid on the common stock
in the "lush years," thus taking into account the abnormal earnings
during the war. P. 518.
11. The improved physical condition of the road through expenditures of the trustees for previously deferred maintenance, improvements and new equipment necessarily entered into the Commission's
valuation of the property. P. 51S.
12. That the creditors who received common stock to make them
whole obtained with it an interest in all cash on hand or that might
be accumulated was an important factor in the allocation of the
new securities. Pp..518, 519.
13. The senior creditors having accepted the plan as fair and
equitable as between themselves, if the method and result of valuation are sound, the allocation of 10% of their claim in common stock
to the junior creditors follows as a matter of computation. P. 519.
14. The objection of a stockholder to a voting trust for future
control of the debtor is ineffective, because the stockholder was
eliminated from the reorganization by the valuation of the property
and allocation of securities. P. 520.
15. The Commission's action in fixing the effective date of the
plan as January 1, 1943, was within its p)ower. P. 521.
16. Assuming that the courts may set aside a plan which was fair
and equitable when adopted hy the Commission merely on account
of subsequent changes in economic conditions, they' should not do
so when the changes arc of the kind that were envisaged and considered by the Commission in its deliberations upon, or explanations
of, the.plan. Pp. 521, 522.
17. It would be erroneous to assume that the senior bondholders
were paid in full by the. securities allotted to them without also

accepting the Commission's determination that the assets represented as of the effective date and all subsequent earnings were a
part also of the common stock that was awarded to them; since the
opportunity to'participate in war earnings and in the accumulations
of cash beyond operating fund needs was part of their compensation
for their loss of position. Pp. 522-524.
18. When common stock is issued in partial satisfaction of the
claims of senior creditors and a reduction of senior capital takes
place after the adoption of the plan by the use of anticipated earnings or -.. ing cash, there can be no corresponding readjustment
of junior participation; because assets in the balance sheet at the
adoption of the plan and subsequent earnings are for the benefit of
stockholders in the new company, the senior claimants, so that they
may be compensated througL these common stock advantages for
their loss of payment in full in cash. Pp. 524, 525.
19. The settled rule in bankruptcy proceedings that a creditor
secured by the property of others need not deduct the value of that
collateral or its proceeds in proving his debt is applicable in proceedings under § 77. P. 529.
20. A provision in a plan of reorganization that the trustee under
a certain bond issue secured in part by a lien on stock owned by a
third party shall be permitted to obtain the release of the equities
in the stock and distribute it among the bondholders or to enforce
its rights as pledgee of the stock and distribute the proceeds to the
bondholders did not change or affect existing rights in the stock;
and those rights remained subject to judicial determination. Therefore, it could not result in the holders of the bonds sect-red thereby
receiving more than they were entitled to nor deprive the holders
of a junior lien on the stock of any of their rights, even though the
Commission made no definite finding as to the value of the stock
and the holders of the senior lien on the stock may have been fully
compensated by other provisions of the plan. Pp. 525-531.
21. The provisions of § 77 (e) for confirmation of a plan of reorganization over the creditors' objection, if the reviewing court finds
that it makes "adequate provision for fair and equitable treatment"
of those rejecting it, that their rejection is not "reasonably justified"
and that the plan complies with the requirements of the section, are
within the bankruptcy powers of Congress. P. 533.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

328 U. S.

By this remand, the Commission was empowered to proceed anew to consideration of the reorganization in all its
phases, § 77 (e), including those steps previously taken
and approved by the opinion of the Circuit Court of
Appeals.
That court approved the valuation of the debtor reached
mainly by the use of present and prospective earnings.
It held that the valuation adopted need not reflect necessarily the money spent for improvements during the trusteeship for reorganization. 150 F. 2d 35. The soundness
of these conclusions is fully supported by ihe Western
Pacific and Milwaukee cases.- The Circuit Court further
held that the Commission was justified in refusing to reopen the hearings just before the entry of its order of June
14, 1943, approving the plan, to hear evidence of the then
existing economic conditions and the 1943 earnings of the
debtor.'
The reversal came from the Circuit Court's holding,
contrary to the Commission and the District Court, that
free cash in excess of operating capital needs and large
earnings from war business after the date of the plan
should be for the benefit of the General bondholders. 150
F. 2d 35-38. That court further.held that decreases in
debt by cash payments, with the consequent reduction of
securities that were required to be issued under the plan
to cover such debt claims, should inure to the benefit of
the same General bondholders. 150 F. 2d 38-39. The
Circuit Court disagreed also with the treatment of certain
collateral deposited behind the First Consolidated Mortgage of the Rio Grande Western Railway Company and
secondarily behind other issues of the debtor. This is the
Utah Fuel stock issue hereinafter discussed. These differences from the c6nclusions of the District Court led the

Opinion of the Court.

Circuit Court to hold that the General bondholders were
"reasonably justified" in rejecting the plan and that the
District Court was without authority to confirm the plan
over their veto. § 77 (e).
Petitioners on July 30, 1945, sought a writ of certiorari
to reverse these rulings of the Circuit Court and, on account (f the importance of the issues in the administration
of railroad reorganization under § 77, we granted their
petition on October 8, 1945. 326 U. S. 699.
The briefs of all the parties here restate the questions
presented in the petition for certiorari according to the
emphasis the particular party places upon pointsof controversy. After a general consideration of the background
of the plan and respondents' contentions to support the
judgment besides the defenses applicable to petitioners'
certiorari, we shall give attention to each of the just stated
disagreements between the district and appellate court.
This will cover the points under review.
The basic problems of railroad reorganization under
§ 77 of the Bankruptcy Act have been so recently
considered by this Court in the Western Pacific and Milwaukee cases that only a summary reference to their
conclusions attacked by respondents need be made now.
No new enactments have changed the law since those
decisions on March 15, 1943. The complexities of the
reorganization of a railroad with responsibility to the public and obligations to its security holders were recognized.
The impossibility without destruction of efficiency and
values of reversing the process of integration to restore
the parts that now make up the whole of a system of
their original operational function was understood. The
various bond issues with different and often overlapping
liens, with competing claims for allocation of earnings
pending reorganization, presented hard problems for legislative solution. A fair, administratively practical and
lasting method was sought. By provisions for adjustment

"(b) A plan of reorganization within the meaning of this section
(1) shall include provisions modifying or altering the rights of creditors generally, or of any class of them, secured or unsecured, either
through the issuance of new securities of any character or otherwise;
(2) may include provisions modifying or altering the rights of stockholders generally, or of any class'of them, either through the issuance
of new securities of any character, or otherwise; (3) may include,
for the purpose of preserving such interests of creditors and stockholders as are not otherwise provided for, provisions for the issuance
to any such creditor or stockholder of options or warrants to receive,
or to subscribe for, securities of the reorganized company in such
amounts and upon such terms and conditions as may be set forth
in the plan; (4) shall provide for fixed charges (including fixed interest
on funded debt, interest on unfunded debt, amortization of discount
on funded debt, and rent for leased railroads) in such an amount that,
after due consideration of the probable prospective earnings of the
property in light of its earnings experience and all other relevant facts,
there shall be adequate coverage of such fixed charges by the probable
earnings available for the payment thereof; .. .
"(d) The debtor, after a petition is filed as provided in subsection
(a) of this section, shall file a plan of reorganization within six months
of the entry of the order by the judge approving the petition as properly filed, . . . After the filing of such a plan, the Commission,
unless such plan shall be considered by it to be prima facie impracticable, shall, after due notice to all stockholders and creditors given
in such manner as it shall determine, hold public hearings, at which
opportunity shall be given to any interested party to be heard, and
following which the Commission shall render a report and order in
which it shall approve a plan, which may be different from any which
has been proposed, that %ill in its opinion meet with the requirements
of subsections (b) and (e) of this section, and will be compatible with
the public interest; or it shall render a report and order in which
it shall refuse to approve any plan. In such report the Commission
shall state fully the reasons for its conclusions.

At this point, we restate our conclusion reached in the
former cases that the congressional authority to the Commission to eliminate valueless claims from participation
in reorganization is a valid exercise of the federal bankruptcy power. Section 77 was directed at the relief of
debtor railroads. § 73. 47 Stat. 1467. Liquidation in
depression periods meant that large portions of debts, as
well as stock interests in the properties, would be irretrievably lost to their holders, while reorganization on a capitalization that estimated what normal income would support meant the salvage of sound values. We see no more
constitutional impediment to the elimination of claims
against railroad debtors by the Interstate Commerce Commission's determination of values, with judicial review as
to the sufficiency of the evidence and compliance with
statutory standards, than we do to their elimination
by an accepted bid in a depression. market.1 There is

already have been wiped out, and their investments, which would
now be of great value, were uselessly destroyed. There are many
more thousands upon thousands of such stockholders whose investments are imminently threatened with a like fate, unless
Congress promptly enacts legislation to prevent such needless
loss. And that loss--aggregating over $2,000,000,000-would be
suffered largely by a widely scattered class of citizens (many
thousands of whom are employees of these very railroads) who
invested their legacies or their savings in one of America's greatest
private enterprises, for education of their children, the purchase
of homes, or security in old age. It literally may be said that
these stocks were the favorite investments of widows and orphans

financial affairs quickly, economically, and on a business basis.
Thj procedure it provides will reduce any disturbance of their
affairs to a minimum, and will provide the maximum of protection
for both the railroads and their investors.
"The existing law, section 77, was enacted in 1933, without hearings and without consideration by any subcommittee or committee
of the Senate. It was enacted in the belief that it would help
railroads to correct their financial affairs. It was found to do the
opposite. It has placed in the hands of Government officials
extraordinary power, which they had not requested, over 25
percent of the country's railroad mileage-a power which they
have exercised:
(1) to demolish every part of the financial and corporate
structures of those railroads;
(2) to plan in every respect the financial and corporate future of those railroads;
(3) to pick men to control those railroads; and
(4) to decree the forfeiture of $21/ billion of investments.
"The present bill puts an end to every one of those powers and
restores the operation of railroads to their managements and the
adjustment of their finances to the companies themselves, with
the assistance of their securityholders, where necessary."

The recent availability to the debtor of

the corporate history, the capital structure at the beginning of the
reorganization proceedings, the traffic and earnings appear throughout
the various reports of the Commission, particularly the original report
in 233 I. C. C. 515. The location'and extent of its properties are succinctly described by the Commission at page 518, as follows:
"The Denver's principal eastern termini are Denver and Pueblo,
Colo., at each of which points connection is made with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway and the Colorado & Southern
Railway. At Denver connection is also made with the Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy Railroad, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific
Railway, and the Union Pacific Railroad; at Pueblo, also with
the Missouri Pacific Railroad, which is the Denver's main outlet
to the east.
"On the west the main line of the Denver passes through Salt
Lake City and terminates at Ogden, Utah. Connection is made
with the Union Pacific at each point; at Salt Lake City the Denver also connects with the Western Pacific Railroad and at Ogden
with the Southern Pacific. The interchange with the Western
Pacific is more important than that with any other western
connection.
"The road owned by the Denver consists of 1,256.6 miles of
main line and 1,094.9 miles of branch lines. Operated under lease
are the Rio Grande Junction Railway . . . extending from Rifle
to Grand Junction, Colo., 62.1 miles, the Goshen Valley Railroad,
a branch line 8.8 miles in length, and the Salt Lake Western, ex
tending from Dotsero, on the Denver, to Orestod on the Denver
& Salt Lake Railway . . . 38.1 miles. Including these leased
lines, the Denver operates approximately 1,357 miles of main lines
and 1,104 miles of branch lines. Approximately 771 miles of
narrow-gage lines are included in the operated mileage.
"In addition to the above-mentioned mileages, the Denver operates over the Salt Lake, between.Denver and Orestod, 128.6 miles.

the Moffat Tunnel and the Dotsero Cut-off (1934) improves its strategic position in the competition for "overhead" or "bridge traffic," that is, traffic that is consigned
from and destined to points beyond its lines, The traffic
originating or terminating on its lines is mixed in character and varies with the general prosperity of the region.
The present Denver, the principal debtor, was organized in 1920. It succeeded the Denver & Rio Grande
Railroad Company of 1908 which had in its turn acquired
the property of the Rio Grande Western Railway Company, owning the western portion of the present debtor's
lines, and of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company
of 1886, owning the eastern portion of the present debtor's
lines. A connection between "the two portions, Rio
Grande Junction Railway, is under lease.to the debtor
which, as lessee and a stockholder, guarantees the Junction
bonds. Substantially all of the capital stocks of the Salt
Lake and Salt Lake Wesiern, and various other'branch
lines are owned by the debtor."' These corporate arrangements for the operations of the debtor have resulted in
the assumption or creation by the debtor of the claims
of the various issues, listed in note 6, supra.
Just after these reorganization proceedings began, December 31, 1935, the debtor's report showed that its longterm debt was $120,541,000, and its current liabilities
$24,990,901.63
It had current assets, including cash
$1,257,943.43, of $5,966,666:93. At the time the plan
This line, together with the Salt Lake Western, constitutes the
Dotsero cut-off route. The Salt Lake's ownership embraces the
line extending from Utah Junction, near Denver, to the western
terminus at Craig, Colo., 220.2 miles. For its Denver terminal,
the Salt Lake uses, under a lease, the facilities of the Northwestern
Terminal Railroad Company. The Salt Lake derives no revenues
irom the through traffic moving over the cut-off, since all s.uch
traffic is handled by the Denver."

There were current assets, including cash $10,850,149.96,
of $20,983,652.54. As of December 31, 1944, these items
were: Long-term debt $129,358,337.79, current liabilities
$20,539,637.83, and deferred liabilities $55,310,151.80.
The current assets were $32,665,501.33, including $19,142,626.96 in cash.
During the period examined the income of the system
available for interest was found by the Commission at
its lowest in 1936-1938. After adjustment this was
$2,893,255. 233 I. C. C. at 552. In 1941 there was
$5,019,436. 254 I. C. C. at 10. When the present plan
was approved by the Commission in June, 1943, the 1942
income available for interest was recognized but the continuance of such earning power was thought to be negatived by any sound forecast. 8 254 I. C. C. at 356.
Earnings during the trusteeship were used to improve
the debtor railroad. When the vote was taken in 1944,
the real estate and equipment account showed charges of
$43,291,513 during the trusteeship. An estimated ten

talization was not substantially increased by the Commission between 1938, when the first draft of a plan came
from the Commission's staff, and 1943, the junior creditors
got little or nothing for this investment. The improvements may have been wise or unwise. That question is
not before us. Railroads, even in reorganizations, must
make additions to take care of public needs or to lower
operating costs. See 62 F. Supp. 389. The senior bond
interest continued to accumulate during this period. As
the capitalization was not increased pari passu with the
purchases, the holders of junior securities received less
participation. The Commission did not consider that the
earning prospect justified a greater capitalization than the
one given and we think its judgment controls the valuation. As was said by the Circuit Court of Appeals in In re
Denver & R. G. W. R. Co., 150 F. 2d at 38:
"Neither was the Commission compelled to, nor
would it be justified in adding the amount of these
expenditures to the capitalized value if in the exercise
of sound discretion it felt that the reasonable prospective earnings of the road, after the improvements
did not justify it. However, in the face of all this,
after satisfying in full the claims of the senior bondholders, the plan of reorganization should have made
sure that all excess current assets, as well as all excess
war profits yet to accrue, would go to the General
Bondholders."
The last sentence, we think, has the vice of overlooking
the reason the Commission gave common stock to the
Seniors. See discussion under Allocation of Securities.
We note also the contention that the possibility of a
national income much higher and interest rates much
lower than before World War II should affect valuation
based on prospective earnings. Those factors, we think,
were before the Commission when it made its earnings
estimate.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

328 U. S.

The Commission reached its determination of a sound
capital structure for the combined properties with these
figures on earnings and investments before it. In addition, of course, the Commission had complete statistical
information to guide it from its Bureau of Valuation and
its other sections dealing with traffic, rates, earnings, interest, et cetera. The discussion by the Commission will
be found in its printed volumes listed in note 2. Proceeding upon the principle accepted in the Western Pacific
and Milwaukee cases,"9 that capitalization based upon
earnings is a permissible method of valuation in reorganization, the Commission fixed $155,173,127 as the sound
capitalization. This capitalization under the terms of the
issues, with provisions for a capital fund and the sinking
funds, carries annual charges at rates varying with the
security of $6,211,250 before dividends on common. This
present annual charge, plus, let us assume, five per cent
annually upon the common, $1,758,379, or a total of
$7,969,629, is the basic figure to be applied, with adjustments for the variable factors, to earnings, past or prospective, available for interest and dividends, as an aid
to determnine the fairness of the present valuation. See
note 6. The decision was unanimous except for one Commissioner who considered the valuation too high by ten
per cent. 254 I. C. C. at 379. There can be no doubt
that as of June, 1943, there was ample evidence to justify
the valuation made by the Commission.
Allocation of Securities. Within the framework of that
valuation, the Commission allotted the available securities to the claimants. Securities, including the common
stock, were given a face value. The'aggregate was too
small to allow anything ta former stockholders."0 Thus
they were eliminated fror the reorganization.2' For the

holders of the General bonds, common stock was available
to the' amount of ten per cent only of their claim." A
glance at the proposed, distribution in note 6 will show
that the claimants did not receive all the new senior securities in the strict order of their old priorities.
The value of a lien on a part of a railroad when the valuation is made from earnings cannot be fixed solely on a
mileage basis. Nor is it practicable to issue new securities
with a lien limited- to the property that was covered by
the old lien. There must be segregation of the system
earnings to each existing lien and allocation of securities
representing the system value to each class of claimants.
This was done hera as shown in the second table in note 6.23
Such a method is in full accord with the principle that
senior creditors are to retain their relative priority of position in a reorganization. Group of Investors v. Milwaukee R. Co., 318 U. S. at 561-64. Furthermore, junior
claims can receive nothing until the senior claims receive
securities of a worth or value equal to their indebtedness.
318 U. S. at 483; 318 U. S. at 569. The Generals are definitely junior. 233 I. C. C. at 524.
The Commission did not make afinding that the cash
value. of the securities awarded the senior claimants as of
the effective date of the plan equalled the face of the
claims. It did, however, carefully state its reasons for
concluding that the compensation "flowing under the plan
to the various classes of bondholders for the rights surrendered' by them" was adequate in the light of the full
priority rule. 254 I. C. C. at 360. For those classes,
other than the Junior Generals, that received common
stock, the Commission said that the possibility of "unlimited dividends on common stock" was a factor in offsetting

less of position.2 ' Thus it is clear that when the Commission made its allocations it had definitely in mind that
one thing that gave the senior creditors compensation for
the admission. of junior claimants to participation in securities before the seniors obtained full cash payment was
their chance to share in the unlimited dividends that might
be earned and paid on the common stock to have a part
in the "lush years." It should be noted that income applicable to dividends was at its highest in 1942 prior to
the approval of the plan by the Co~mission in June, 1943.
Therefore the abnormal earnings of1942 were in the Commission's contemplation when it spoke of the opportunities for "unlimited dividencis." Its discussion of the plan
assumed that 1943 available earnings might be as large.
254 I. C. C. at 355.
The improved physical condition of the road through
expenditures of the trustees for previously deferred maintenance, improvements and new equipment was before
the Commission and necessarily entered into their valuation of the property. 233 I. C. C. 531..
There is another important factor, corollary to stock
ownership, to be noted in the Commission's allocation of
these securities. This factor, is that the creditors who
received common stock to make them whole obtained with

Rio Grande Western consolidated, 254 I. C. C. at 365: "Loss in
earnings position and surrender of other rights, in our opinion, are
offset by the possibility of increased return permitted by the 41/2'percent income bonds, 5-percent convertible preferred stock, unlimited dividends on common stock, and the other features of the plan."
Denver & Rio Grande consolidated, id. at 364: "This apparent
change in earnings position is offset by the new sinking fund and capital fund and by the increased, rate of return obtainable from the new
securities, i. e., slightly in excess of 4.5 percent for 64 percent Pf the
claim and unlimited stock dividends for the remainder."

that common stock an interest in all cash on hand or all
cash that might be accumulated. Of course, the'Commission thoroughly understood this. In fact, it referred to
the ten million plus of cash on hand as of January 1, 1943.
254 I. C. C. 353. Immediately following this reference
is a full discussion of the cash needs of the road for the year
1943, including additions: betterments and new equipment, and the amount which it was estimated would
be in the treasury at the end of the year. That was
$15,600,000. This cash would be reflected in the value
of the common stock. The petitioner states that the
highest when-issued Stock Exchange price in 1945 for the
common stock was $31-1/.',, par $100. See Commercial and
Financial Chronicle, May 13, 1946, p. 2618, where the
common is quoted at 29 Bid. 31 Asked. Cash, matcrial
and supplies, as well as all other assets and all liabilities
of the debtor, were represented by the securities. If there
is more cash on hand than needed for tages, 'expenses and
proper improvements, it is at the disposal 'of the common
stockholders. If money was used to pay indebtedness,
there would be a corresponding reduction in the capital
structure. Therefore, the plan provided, 254 I. C. C. at
386:
"The new company shall be deemed to have come
into possession of the properties as of the effective
date of the plan.

as of January 1, 1943, after consummation of the
plan . . . shall consist substantially of the following

securities, excluding those to be pledged, the amounts

liabilities are paid or reduced . ..

It is accepted' by the senior claimants that the plan is fair
and equitable as between themselves. If we. are correct

is sound, the allocation of ten per cent of their claim in
common stock to the Generals follows as a matter of
computation.
It would also follow that the objection of a stockholder,
the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, through its
Trustee in reorganization, to a voting trust for future
control of the debtor would be ineffective because this
stockholder is eliminated from the reorganization by the
valuation of the property and allocation of securities.

value in estimating the probable future earnings of this
property in the peace 'conomy which is to come" and
that the Commission was well within its right in appraising them.lightly. 150 F. 2d at 34. This was after the

a small amount of common stock, ten per cent of their
total claim. Adequate operating funds are essential
to the operation of a railroad. The Senior Bondholders were entitled to receive in addition to the
full amount of their claims, working capital sufficient

. "We think it is apparent from the record that there
were current assets on hand consisting of cash and
securities in excess of what was needed for the efficient
operation of the road. As pointed out, the working
capital of the debtor had increased from a deficit of
$9,727,230 as of December 31, 1935, to a surplus of
$12,125,863.50 as of December 31, 1944. While these
increased net earnings are due in large part to the
war and will not continue after the end of the war,
and may therefore be disregarded in setting up the
capitalized structure based upon prospective earnings,
we cannot disregard the fact that these huge surpluses actually exist. Their existence is an accomplished fact. It is also obvious that surpluses will
contiriue to pile up for a reasonable time yet to come.
We think any plan which fails to take this into
account and which gives the Senior Bondholders their
claims in full by substantially delivering the road to
them, and gives them the surplus cash actually on
hand and further enables them to receive in addition
the excess war profits which are reasonably sure to
come, is inherently inequitable and unfair, so long as
there are classes of creditors whose claims are not
fully satisfied."
In our judgment this holding is erroneous.
The effective date of the plan was fixed by the Commission as January 1, 1943. This was in its power." The
allocation of the securities took into consideration the interest of the secured claims to that date. Any gain or any
loss after that time was a benefit or an injury to the new
common stockholders and then sometimes to security
holders in positions senior to them. Assuming that the

changes in economic Conditions of the region or the nation," it should not be done when the changes are of the
kind that were envisaged and considered by the Commission in its deliberations upon or explanations of the
plan.
We have pointed out in the section of this opinion dealing with the allocations of the securities that a part of the
compensation to senior claimaiits for their loss of position
was the opportunity to participate in war earnings. This
was understood by the District Court 2 and the Commission.28 'Accumulations of cash beyond operating fund
needs are in the same category. In dealing with the problem, the Commission noted that a five per cent dividend
on the authorized common would require an income available for interest and dividends of $7,969,629. The Trustee for General bonds claims no such earnings between
1929 and 1942. Even before the transportation difficulties of 1946, it was obvious that the Commission's judgment was being confirmed by events. See note 18,

The uncertainties of future estimates are recognized. It is not without interest to note, however,

523

Opinion of the Court.

The error of the Circuit Court in its holdings set out
above lies in its assumption that the senior bondholders
were paid in full by the securities allotted to them without also accepting the determination of the Commission
that the assets represented as of January 1, 1943, and all
come imperative. This is the result of an extraordinary combination of war and postwar conditions with which the railroads
are confronted, and more particularly the result of three factors
of recent development: (1) the increase in wages of railroad
employes of 16 cents per hour determined under the procedures
of the Railway Labor Act in April, 1946, retroactive to January 1,
1946; (2) large increases, both present and prospective, in the
prices of railway materials and supplies; and (3) a sharp decline
in volume of railway traffic and an even greater decline in railway
revenue.
"The volume of freight and passenger traffic is falling continuously, and it is anticipated that the downward rate will accelerate
in the months to come. The revenues will be reduced by reason
both of the decline in volume and a return to a more nearly normal composition of traffic. It is estimated that the operating
revenues of Class I railroads for 1946, on the basis of the present
rates, fares and charges, would be approximately $6,800,000,000,
or 23.5 per cent less than they were in 1945.
"Freight and passenger traffic reached their peaks in 1944. But
net railway operating income and net income began to diminish
in 1943 on account of rising costs of operation. In the face of
increasing traffic through 1944, both net railway operating income
and net income moved steadily downward after reaching their
peak in 1942. With the cessation of hostilities in 1945 there began
to be a decline also in gross revenues which is expected to become more pronounced as the abnormal war conditions disappear, disabilities of highway carriers and other agencies of
transportation are removed, and the prewar pattern of railway
traffic is resumed."
The Denver apparently did not vary greatly from this overall picture. Its net revenue for 1945 from railway operations dropped from
$20,569,809 to $14,246,504. Its gross operating revenue, however,
increased four and a half million. The loss in net was due largely to
increased amortization of defense projects.
The monthly report of revenues and expenses by the Denver for
January and February of 1946 shows a decrease of operating revenues
from $10,856,764 to $8,932,983.

that was awarded the senior bondholders.
Decreases in Senior Debt. The plan provides for securities to take the place of the Rio Grande Junction's first
5's in the face amount of $2,758,333 and for the assumption
by the reorganized road of $5,758,000 equipment obligations. All of these securities are senior to the Generals.
The Denver purchased the 'Junctions and paid $1,218,000
on the Equipments. This reduced the necessary capitalization by that aggregate sum. The Circuit Court of
Appeals was of the opinion that "The value behind these
securities in no wise belonged to the Senior Bondholders,
because they had been paid in full." 150 F. 2d 39. This
ruling, ,we conclude, was erroneous for the same basic
reason that we held the cash and war earnings belong to
the owners of the common stock.
We called attention, supra page 519, to the authority
granted the District Court to reduce the capitalization
of the new company as interest due on January 1, 1943,
or equipment obligations or other liabilities were paid.
The District Court acted on this authority and in its
approval of the plan said of the Junctions, "They may be
cancelled or they may be utilized under the plan in acquisition of new securities which will become an asset of the
reorganized company." C. C. H., Bankruptcy Law Service Decisions 1942-1945, f 54,562 at p. 55,635. The Junction bondholders did not vote on the plan. Under our
determination that the creditors who received common
stock were compensated partly by the assets and future
earnings, it is obvious that the use of such assets to retire
senior claims is a part of the normal and expected increment from holdings of common stock. The increase of
common stock by the Commission to the Generals from
five to ten per cent of the bondholders' claims, preliminary
to the adoption of the plan, 254 I. C. C. at 352, 359, is
partly attributable to a reduction of necessary capitaliza-

Opinion of the Court.

tion. This increase in junior participation differs from
that now proposed. The former reduction of senior capitalization could be carried out because earnings prior to
the adoption of the plan made it unnecessary to borrow
money for reorganization. When proposed capitalization
is being planned on earnings, a reduction of senior capital
without reduction of estimated earnings increases possible
junior capital within the scheme. When the reduction
of senior capital takes place after the adoption of the
plan by use of anticipated earnings or existing cash, there
can be no such readjustment of junior participation because assets in the balance sheet at the adoption of the
plan and subsequent earnings are, as we have pointed
out, for the benefit of the stockholders in the new company
so that through these common stock advantages these new
stockholders may be compensated for their loss of payment in full in cash. Of course, this section of the opinion
is written and must be read on the assumption that the
allocations of common stock are fair and equitable, a
matter discussed supra.

Railroad Co. in 1899 executed its First Consolidated Mortgage, an indenture to secure its issue of First Consolidated

The Utah Fuel.Company was organized in 1900, with
a capitalization of 100,000 shares. In 1901 an agreement
was entered into by Rio Grande Western, the trustee under
the First Consolidated Mortgage, and the owner of the
Utah Fuel stock. The contract provided that the stock
would be held by the trustee to secure bonds issued under
the First Consolidated Mortgage and that Rio Grande
Western would have the right at any time on paying the
trustee $6,000,000 in cash or delivering an equal face
amount in First Consolidated bonds to receive the Utah

In 1908, the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company
was organized and acquired the property of'Rio Grande
Western, assuming the obligation of its First Consolidated
Mortgage bonds of 1899.. The equity of redemption of
Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company in the Utah Fuel
stock was sold in 1918 under execution and transferred
to the Western Pacific Railroad Corporation.

agreement would pay all dividends received by him from
the trustee under the Consolidated Mortgage on Utah
Fuel stock to the debtor so long as any of the General
or Refunding bonds were outstanding.
The agreement further provided that, if the General

equity of redemption in the stock, dividing any surplus
between Western Pacific and Missouri Pacific.
The General Mortgage and Refunding bonds
created
in the 1924 reorganization were thus given a lien on the
Utah Fuel stock, junior to the lien of the Denver & Rio
Grande First Consolidated Mortgage.
Under the plan approved by the Commission and the
District Court, the First Consolidated bonds were allotted
20% of their claim in new income bonds, 73% in preferred
stock,.and 7% in common stock. The plan further provided, 254 I. C. C. at 398-99, that:
"The trustee under the Rio Grande Western-Railway Company consol idated mortgage shall be permitted to obtain the release of the equities in the
stock of the Utah Fuel Company and distribute the
stock among the holders of the aforesaid bonds in
any manner agreeable to them, or to enforce its rights
as pledgee of the stock of the Utah Fuel Company,
the proceeds recovered to be distributed to the holders
of the bonds."
The Commission took the position that this and the other
features of the treatment of the First Consolidated bonds
were justified as compensation for "loss in earnings position and surrender of other rights" I under the plan.
The Commission made no definite finding with respect
to the value of the Fuel Company stock. The Commission had before it evidence throuih 1936 with respect to
the value of the stock as well as an appraisal of the value
of the Fuel Company made for the trustee of the First
Consolidated Mortgage, which indicated a value of
$4,653,720. The only dividend paid to the debtor by
Utah Fuel under the 1924 agreement was in 1934 and
amounted to $250.000: the debtor in applying its formula
for allocation of earnings by mortgage districts credited
the Consolidated Mortgage with an income of $83,333 per

annum based on that dividend payment allocated over
the three-year period, 1932 to 1934. The status of the
stock was considered by the Commission in its original
report and its several supplemental reports, and its proposals with respect to the stock remained unchanged.
In proceedings before the District Court in 1943 on objections to the plan, it was revealed that the Fuel Company's net income for 1942 was $415,000 and for the first
seven months of 1943, $535,869.1 The company has no
funded debt.
In the Circuit Court the respondents contended that the
holders of the First Consolidated bonds should be compelled either to foreclose this collateral, applying the proceeds to their claim, or credit their claim with the value
of the collateral and be allowed new securities only for the
balance. The Circuit Court disapproved the treatment
by the plan of the General bondholders with respect to the
Fuel Company stock, pointing to the fact that the Commission had permitted "doubts and uncertainties" to remain with respect to the value of the collateral, and that
there was a danger that, if the collateral had substantial
value, the First Consolidated oondholders might receive
more than full payment.
The facts set out above fully support the conclusion of
the Commission that the "title to the stock is vested in
the Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific." Whatever
rights the debtor may have retained after the sale of the
stock on execution in 1918 were released to the trustee
and the two railroads in 1924. We have then a situation
in which the holders of the ultimate beneficial interest
in stock which had been pledged previously under a mortgagre have permitted that interest to be encumbered by
a third person, namely the debtor, as security for its

General and Refunding bonds. The rule is settled in
bankruptcy proceedings that a creditor secured by the
property of others need not deduct the value of that collateral or its proceeds in proving his debt. Ivanhoe Bldg.
& Loan Assn. v. Orr, 295 U. S. 243. We see no reason
why the same should not be true under § 77. See New
York Trust Co. v. Palmer, 101 F. 2d 1, 3. Therefore the
First Consolidated-,Mortgage bonds were properly permitted to prove the full amount of their debt.
Respondents, speaking only for the General bondholders, object that the plan gives the First Consolidated bondholders all the Utah Fuel stock or its proceeds in addition
to securities the face value of which amounts to one hundred per cent of their claims. The Refunding bondholders
make no objection. It is thus contended that the plan
deprives the General bondholders of their junior interest
in the stock without a determination of the value of that
stock, or a finding of the extent to which the Consolidated
bondholders have been paid by the new securities to be
given them. We do not so read the plan. The plan
provides merely that the trustee of the Consolidated
Mortgage "shall be permitted to obtain the release of
the equities in the stock of the Utah Fuel Company" and
distribute the stock or its proceeds to the holders of the
bonds. This statement contains at least two requirements
to be met before the Consolidated bonds obtain anything
from the collateral. The first is that the trustee of the
First Consolidated Mortgage be in existence. Even after
the plan goes into operation and the old securities are
surrendered for cancellation, there is no requirement that
the trusts terminate since they will continue to hold property other than that of the debtor. Section 77 (f), which
deals with the effect of a confirmation and the discharge
of the debtor fr6m liability, does not so require. Hence
whatever action the trustee of the Consolidated takes may
be commenced prior to or after the consummation of the

plan. This will permit the respondent, trustee under the
General. Mortgage, which would continue in existence for
the purpose, to take the necessary steps to safeguard its
rights in the collateral on behalf of the Generals.32
The second requirement, which is explicit in the plan,
is that the trustee obtain the release of the equities in the
stock. The junior lienors have an absolute right under
the terms of the 1901 pledge and the 1924 agreement to
all the proceeds of the stock over $6,000,000 and a right
also to any part of the proceeds not needed to make the
First Consolidated bonds whole. The trustee of the Consolidated concedes in its brief here that enforcement of
the pledge can be brought about only through judicial
proceedings. It correctly points out that in such proceedings full protection can be given to all those who have
any junior interest in the stock. Respondents' fear that
the General bondholders and the mortgage trustees for
the junior interests will not be in existence and so unable
to protect themselves has been above demonstrated to be
without foundation in fact.
The result is that this feature of the plan did not in any
way change or affect existing rights in the collateral. The
respondents may show in the judicial proceedings which
must be brought by the trustee of the First Consolidated
Mortgage that the First Consolidated bonds have been
fully paid by the securities awarded them under the plan,
if such be the fact, or the respondent, trustee of the General, may itself bring a proceeding against the trustee of
the First Consolidated mortgage for a determination of
the rights of the Generals. Petitioners concede, as they
must, .that they are not entitled to more than full payment
and that they are under a duty to account to the respond32 Obviously, the Fuel stock or its proceeds could be distributed

ents for any surplus remaining after they have been made
whole.33
The treatment of the Utah Fuel stock in the plan is
consistent with the Commission's disposition of certain
collateral pledged with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Railroad Credit Corporation by parties
other than the debtor to secure notes of the debtor in
the Western Pacific case. Western Pacific R. Co. Reorjanization, 233 I. C. C. 409, 432. The Commission
permitted the pledgees to retain the collateral and this
Court approved that action, saying, "This collateral, other
than the refunding bonds, was therefore left with the
pledgees with its position unaffected by any direct action
of the Commission." Ecker v. Western Pacific R. Corp.,

Reasonableness of Rejection. As the conclusions of the
Circuit Court of Appeals upon the allocation of securities,
the treatment by the Commission of cash, war earnings,
and decrease in debt with priority over the Generals differed from those made by this Court, that court's conclu*sion that the General bondholders were reasonably
justified in rejecting the plan followed naturally. 150

General bondholders, to reject the plan subject to the

33There is a certain illogic in the position of First Consolidated
bonds in asserting any rights in the collateral at all. If, as they concede and we now hold, they are entitled to be paid in full in new securities without regard to the collateral, it may be that they have been
fully paid by the new securities given them since they do not complain
of their treatment under the plan. Since they are entitled only to full
payment it would then seem to follow that they have no rights against
the collateral. We should not be taken as deciding this question,
however, since we leave it to an independent suit in which there is
jurisdiction over the proper parties.

This provision for confirmation of a plan despite rejection by a class appeared in the draft for the 1935 amendments. Apparently it caused no particular comment.35

the consent of two-thirds of each class of stockholders must be acquired, unless, by an elaborate valuation proceeding, it is proved that
the value of the property is so low that the stock has no interest. This
is an effective obstruction ...
"In order to remedy these defects, S. 1634, as amended, provides
that two-thirds of those of each class who vote upon a plan will bind
the dissenters or those failing to vote. But it also provides that the
court may make effective a fair plan where the parties do not

. If two-thirds of each class consent, the plan will bind the

remainder of each class. But the judge may make the plan effective,
even if not so accepted, if he finds that it conforms to the requirements
just stated, provides fair and equitable treatment for the interests of
those rejecting it, and that their rejection is not reasonably justified in
the light of the respective rights and interests. These provisions give
complete due process of law from a procedural standpoint, there being
provision for full hearings both before the commission and the court.
Within the broad powers of Congress under the bankruptcy clause as
recently declared by the Supreme Court in Continental Illinois Bank

Opinion of the Court.

We think that the provisions for confirmation by the
courts over the creditors' objection are within the bankruptcy powers of Congress. Those powers are adequate
to eliminate claims by administrative valuations with judicial review and they are adequate to require creditors
to acquiesce in a fair adjustment of their claims, so long as
the creditor gets all the value of his lien and his share of
6
any free assets?
The grounds accepted by us in former sections of this
opinion as sustaining, as of January 1. 1943, the valuation
of the road, the allocation of the securities, and the treatment of cash. war earnings and capital reductions establish that for the act of confirmatioi on November 29, 1944,
over the objection of the General. bondholders, the finding
of the judge that. the plan then made "adequate provision
for fair and equitable treatment" of the dissenters was
justified. 62 F. Supp. at 390. In view of the district
judge's familiarity with the reorganization, this finding
has especial weight with us. See Rule 52, F. R. C. P.
There is no doubt that the plan then conformed to subsection (b) and the other requirements of the first paragraph of subsection (e). Note 9 supra.
This leaves for consideration the question of whether,
the plan being fair and equitable as of June, 1943, effective
January 1, 1943, the Generals were reasonably justified
in rejecting the plan by ballots cast between April 26
and July 15, 1944.
As we have pointed out under Allocation of Securities,
supra, the Commission's plan was adopted after 1942, the
year of greatest profit, and "wvith anticipation on the part
of the Commission that there might be other "big" years

basis for higher valuation. Current reports of earnings

were a part of the record. Nothing that respondents have
called to our attention indicates any improvement in economic conditions or prospects in July, 1944, or any date
since, over June, 1943, the date of the Commission's approval of the plan, which would justify a treatment different from that accorded the claimants in 1943.37 The
challenge to the reasonableness or the unreasonableness
of the rejection of the plan is not based on any change
of conditions since its approval by the District Court
October 25, 1943. Under subsection (e), note 9 supra,
the judge automatically confirms a plan after a vote of
classes of creditors if satisfied that two-thirds of each
class have accepted. If there is a rejection, there is a
reexamination of the plan to assure that those who dissent
have had fair and equitable treatment. Apparently the
reexamination for this treatment does not differ from that
for the original court approval under the first paragraph
of subsection (e). It does, however, center upon the
rights of those who rejected the plan.
A rejection would not be reasonably justified unless the
dissenters had a valid reason for their vote. As is shown
by Judge Symes' discussion of their objections to confir
mation, their reasons were the payment of the senior
obligations with consequent claimed release of capitalization for junior securities and the inadequate valuation,
particularly in view of the large additions to plants from
earnings. We think that we have demonstrated that
there was an adequate basis for the valuation, see page
512 et seq., and that the decreases in senior debt were not
for the account of the junior creditors. See -pp. 524-525,
supra. Respondents offer no other ground for their votes
in rejection.

of the 1933 statute, note 35, supra, certainly did not intend
to leave a class with the same power of interference because in its re-isonable judgment that class thought the
valuation was erroneous or the senior creditors were paid
in full by the face value of securities. If a plan gives fair
and equitable treatment to dissenters, the elements which
make the plan fair and equitable cannot be the basis for
a reasonably justified rejection. If only those elements
are relied upon, as here, the rejection is not reasonably
justified.
Of course, this does not mean that if a plan is approved
as fair and equitable by the Commission and the court,
there cannot be a reasonable justification for its rejection
by a class of claimants on submission.

Reasons to make

their rejection reasonable may arise thereafter. For
example, unanticipated, large earnings might develop.
We see no reasonable justification here for the action of
the General bondholders.

in conclusion, we shall add that th6 foregoing opinion
has been written without heavy reliance upon the duty
of the Commission to plan reorganizations with an eye
to the public interest as well as the private welfare of
creditors and stockholders. 9 The Commission had this
duty in mind. Our failure to comment more upon that
feature of the plan should not be interpreted as an intimation upon our part that it is not important. These
respondents cannot be called upon to sacrifice their property .so that a depression-proof railroad system might be
created. But they invested their capital in'a public utility

speculators in senior bonds as well as the holders of General bonds or other investors or speculators in junior security issues, by their entry into a railroad enterprise,

this class of creditors (79.33%) voted to reject the plan.
Congress has made the right of any class to reject a plan

rejection, if the judge "is satisfied and finds . . . that such

construction of the requirements of Congress for the adjudication of railroad reorganizations, as applied to the
situation before us, I cannot escape agreement with the
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Railroad reorganizations are so enshrouded in the confusing intricacies of high finance that the true nature of
decisive issues is too often lost to view. It may be useful
to an appreciation of what appears to me to be the crux of
the case to put a situation that is sufficiently analogous
but much more familiar. In the early depression years the

big life insurance companies foreclosed a large number
of farms. The foreclosure process, we assume, involved
the control of the farm and all its income by a judge. The
hypothetical farm began to make a fair income, enough
to pay the insurance company a considerable part, if not
the whole, of the annual interest. But instead of paying
the interest, the judge applied the money to rebuild the
homestead, to add a new barn, to purchase an adjacent
field, the most modern machinery and additional head of
cattle. Thereby the farm became far more valuable than
at any time since the insurance company placed the
mortgage on it. Moreover, the judge retained as cash in
the bank a portion of the income sufficient to pay off at
ledst twenty percent of the mortgage. The farmer thinks
he ought to be allowed to use the cash to reduce the
mortgage, should be given credit for the income which the
judge used to make the considerable improvements and
which could have been used to reduce the mortgage. This
would appear to be a natural attitude on the part of the
farmer, and it would hardly seem that he was not reasonably justified to resist the claim of the insurance company
to the farm, with all its improvements as well as the cash
in bank.
This simple analogy may look almost trifling alongside
the complicated details involved in a plan for the reorganization of a railroad system. But is it an oversimplification of the controlling issue, namely, was the Circuit
Court of Appeals wrong in holding that the General Bondholders were "reasonably justified" in rejecting the plan?
Let the facts, clearly and fairly stated in the opinions
below, speak for themselves. Judge Huxman thus summarizes the Court's conclusion that the General Bondholders had "a real grievance":
"On November 1, 1935, the Debtor's total debts
senior to the claim of the General Bondholders was
slightly over $101,000,000. The General Bondhold-

ers' claims at that time were approximately $30,000,000, making the total of the two claims approximately
$131.000,000. Any one of the ten plans of reorganization prior to the final one fixed the value of the property at more than enough to satisfy the claims of all
bondholders in full, as of the date this proceeding was
instituted. During the ten intervening years, the
claim of the Senior Bondholders increased to more
than $139,000,000, and that of the General Bondholders to more than $43,500,000, making a total of more
than $182,000,000, required for the two classes of
claims.
During all of this period the Debtor enjoyed substantial income, amounting to approximately $50,000,000. Instead of using this income in payment
of interest on the senior claims, it was used in making
permanent and lasting improvements in the road.
More than $43,000,000 was used in this way. None
of these expenditures has resulted in a comparable
increase or in any substantial increase in the final
valuation, over the valuation prior to the making of
the improvements. But as a result of this operation,
the position of the General Bondholders has deteriorated from a 100 per cent participation in the
amount of their claims to a mere ten per cent. Nor
does it change the picture to say that these improvements were necessary to the railroad system. The
fact still remains that earnings in which all had a vital
interest were used in building a new railroad in many
respects, which will be handed over to the Senior
Bondholders, and the General Bondholders will practically be eliminated as a result thereof.
But this alone does not entitle the General Bondholders to a greater participation in the reorganized
company. Neither does it condemn the plan of reorganization or the capital structure set up therein.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

The operation of a railroad involves the expenditure
of large sums for operation. It involves the formulation of plans of operation and the exercise of judgment and discretion. If, in the exercise of this discretion, funds are unwisely spent, from the viewpoint
of the interest of all creditors, they may feel aggrieved, but they have no legal cause of complaint.
Neither was the Commission compelled to, nor
would it be justified in adding the amount of these
expenditures to the capitalized value if in the exercise of sound discretion it felt that the reasonable
prospective earnings of the road, after the improvements did not justify it. However, in the face of all
this, after satisfying in full the claims of the seillor
bondholders, the plan of reorganization should have
made.sure that all excess current assets, as well as all
excess war profits yet to accrue, would go to the
General Bondholders.
The commission, as pointed out, adopted a conservative, sound estimate of the prospective earnings of the reorganized company. For this it is not to
be criticized. An over-optimistic view would again
surely lead the Debtor into the bankruptcy courts,
with which it has had too much acquaintance already.' We, however, feel that there is more than a
speculative probability that these war industries
which have been constructed along the system, as well
as the improvements which have been made by the
"'Properties included in this railroad system have participated
in the following reorganizations: The Denver & Rio Grande
R. Co. was a successor in a reorganization proceeding in 1886;
the Rio Grande & Western R. Co. was the successor in a reorganization proceeding in 1889; these two companies consolidated
in 1908 under the name of the Denver & Rio Grande R. Co.;
the present company was reorganized in 1920 and again in 1922
to 1924."

use of these net earnings, might produce greater net
returns than anticipated in the plan. If such should
be the case, they certainly belong to the General
Bondholders and not to the Seniors, and the plan
should bring this about. It could be done by issuing
to the General Bondholders an additional amount of
a subordinate stock which would receive returns only
from excess dividends. This is amere suggestion on
our part, and in no wise binding on the Commission.
Our duty is limited to pointing out defects in the plan.
It is the responsibility of the Commission to correct
them.
The Junction Bonds
We think that the complaint as to the manner
in which the Junction Bonds were handled is well
taken. The Rio Grande Junction Railroad is a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Debtor. It had bonds outstanding in the hands of the public for the payment
of which the Debtor was liable, totaling $2,758,333.
This claim was senior to that of the General Bondholders. The plan set aside securities for the payment of this claim. In an order dated September 13,
1943, the District Court directed the trustee to pay
this claim with some of the surplus cash on hand, and
retained the securities which were to be used in the
payment thereof in the treasury of the company.
The court treated the transaction as a purchase of
securities rather than a payment of a debt. This is
a play upon words, and, in any event, is immaterial
to the issue. The fact remains that the new capitalization provided securities for the payment of these
bonds. The value behind these securities in no wise
belonged to the Senior Bondholders, because they had
been paid in full. When surplus cash was used to pay
this claim, the value behind the securities set aside for
that purpose remained undistributed. Since the

Senior Bondholders had been satisfied, in full, this
undistributed value in all equity and fairness
belonged to the General Bondholders. Any plan
which does not give it to them does not comply with
the requirements of Section 77, sub. e, of the Act."
150 F. 2d 28. 38-39.
Inasmuch as the decision in this case seems to me to
turn on an adequate appreciation of the facts, I deem it
important to quote the analysis of the situation on the
basis of which Judge Phillips reached his conclusion:
"On November 1, 1935, during the depths of the
national depression, the debtor came into court for
reorganization. At that time the debtor's senior
debts ahead of the general mortgage bonds aggregated slightly over $101,000,000 and the claim of the
general mortgage bondholders aggregated about
$30,000,000. With an immediate reorganization, a
capitalization of $132,000,000 would have been adequate to give the general mortgage bondholders new
stock equal to 100 per cent of their claim. No capitalization or valuation ever proposed for the debtor, in
any plan presented, has been that low. During the
eight years' delay in reorganization (in nowise due
to the general mortgage bondholders, but, at least in
part, to controversies among the senior security holdc:rs) and up to January 1, 1943, the effective date
of the plan, the claims of the senior security holders,
due to the accrual and nonpayment of interest, increased about $38,000,000. The debtor's net income
available for interest during the trusteeship to the
end of 1944 amounted to $49,420,972. It exceeded by
approximately $9,500,000 the interest charges which
accrued oin the claims of senior security holders to
the end of that. year. As of December 31,1935, the
debtor's current aets were $9,727,230 less than its

R. F. C. v. DENVER & R. G. W. R. CO.
495

FRANKFURTER, J., dissenting.

current liabilities. As of December 31, 1944, the
debtor's current assets exceeded its current liabilities
by $12,125,863.50. Thus, it will be seen there has
been a favorable change in the current situation of
$21,853,093, and, moreover, since the plan was formulated, the Junction Bonds have been paid and
equipment obligations have been reduced from
$5,758,000, the amount provided for in the plan, to
$4,54.0,000, a reduction in that requirement of
$1,218,000.
Approximately $43,000,000 of the income available,
but not used, for the payment of interest 'has been"
expended in. permanent improvements and betterments. While the investment value of the debtor's
property thus was substantially increased,-.the Commission's valuation, based on estimated future earnings, was not increased proportionately. As a result,
the claim of the senior security holders has increased
and the participation of the general mortgage bondholders has been pressed downward until it is now
fixed at 10 per cent of the new common stock. Many
of the improvements and betterments referred to
-above have substantially increa§ed the capacity of the
railroad- to handle increased traffic as it arises. Central train control installed in many segments, where
the greatest density of traffic obtains, gives to those
segments, in a large degree, the equivalent of a double-track railroad and .increases the number of trains
that can be operated over the road and the volume 6f
traffic that can be handled by the road. Other of such
improvements have contributed to efficiency -and
economy in operations. These improvements have
enabled the debtor to handle the great increase in
traffic resulting from the war effort and have placed
the debtor in a position to more economically and
efficiently handle a volume of traffic largely in excess

544

of its prewar traffic, should future economic conditions produce such traffic. Under the plan approved
and confirmed by the district court, 90 per cent of
the common stock goes to the holders of the senior
securities and 10 per cent to the general mortgage
bondholders. As a result, should there be a substaritial increase in the debtor's postwar traffic over its
prewar traffic, 90 per cent of the increased earnings
will inure to the benefit of the holders of the senior
securities and only 10 per cent to the general mortgage
bondholders, whose claim was decreased 90 per cent
by reason of the failure to discharge interest accruals
with income available therefor and the diversion of
such income to the cost of such permanent improvements. It seems to me, under all these circumstances,
that, in addition to the other adjustments required to
make the plan fair and equitable, the Commission
should endeavor to modify the plan so as to give relief
from the situation that lets the full impact of the improvement program fall upon the claim of the general
mortgage bondholders and accords them no corresponding benefits." 150 F. 2d 28, 40, 41-43.
From the confusing financial details one stark fact
emerges. In 1939 the Commission found that the debtor
would be able to earn enough in the future to provide an
income on one-third of the General Mortgage bonds. 233
I. C. C. 515, 592. In the reorganization plan in 1943 the
Commission concluded that the debtor would not earn
enough to provide income on more than one-tenth of the
General Mortgage claims. 254 I. C. C. 349, 359, 380.
The capitalization proposed by the Commission in 1943
eliminated as valueless more of the total claim of the
General Mortgage bonds and more of the face amount of
these bonds than did the capitalization proposed by the
Commission in 1939. Since 1939 the debtor achieved a
position permitting it to make large debt reductions and

R. F. C. v. DENVER & R. G. W. R. CO.

J., dissenting.

to reduce considerably its interest charges. It accumulated a very large net income in excess of its interest service, it expended large sums to decrease operating costs and
improve its business prospects, so that the future earning
power of the railroad was greatly increased. In the face
of all these factors the senior security holders were given
not only securities for the full amount of their claim but
also all cash accumulations available for the reduction of
the road's indebtedness. Improvements in the financial
and physical structure of the road patently calculated to
increase the profits of the future owners of this road have
been made the basis of substantially wiping out one class of
the present owners. Inequitable consequences such as
these led the Circuit Court of Appeals to conclude that the
plan failed to satisfy the command of Congress that as a
matter of judicial judgment a reorganization plan must be
foind "fair and equitable."
To defeat the plan it is not necessary, however, to find
it intrinsically wanting in fairness and equity. Congress
did not authorize the enforcement of a plan for reorganization once it is found, as a matter of judicial judgment,
to be "fair and equitable." Congress wrote into law
another and a vital condition to the validity of a railroad
reorganization plan. A plan must also commend itself as
"fair and equitable" to the various classes of creditors.
And if any class rejects it, the plan can prevail only if the
District Court is warranted in finding that such rejection
"is not reasonably justified in the light of the respective
rights and interests of those rejecting it and all the relevant facts . . ." 49 Stat. 911, 919 (1935), 11 U. S. C.
§ 205 (e).
Claimants who are thus entitled to vote on their interests as a class are surely not expected to vote as altruists
any more than they are to be allowed to behave as
unreasonable obstructionists. If that which Congress has
written is not to be stricken out, we must recognize the

referendum which Congress has lodged in each class of

creditors as a means of self-protection by each class of
creditors and not as an occasion for empty dialectic. On
a fair and practical construction of the power which Congress has seen fit to place in the hands of the various
creditor classes, a class can be deemed not "reasonably
justified" in exercising the right which Congress gave them
to.vote their interests, only if a court can say that no
intelligent class of creditors, regardful of their class interests, but not obviously hostile to the common interest with
which their class interest is involved, could have objected
to the plan. Any other construction reads "reasonably
justified" out of the statute. In effect that is what the
District Court has done. And this Court, with almost the
candor of silence, appears to sanction such judicial deletion
of what Congress has written. For it does not find that
the General Bondholders were not reasonably justified
from their intrinsic point of view to exercise their right to
reject the plan. It does little more than assert this conclusion, apparently on the finding that the plan was in
fact "fair and equitable." It imposes its judgment that
the plan was "fair and equitable" upon the General Bondholders and thus in effect deprives them of the very right
which Congress gave them to be judges of their own interests so long as the court cannot say they were capricious or
greedy in their judgment. This Court seems to be of
the view that if in its judgment a plan is "fair and equitable," it must appear equally fair and equitable to every
class of creditors. Here three circuit judges found the
plan not "fair and equitable," yet this Court holds that
the General Bondholders were not "reasonably justified"
in not finding it "fair and' equitable." This can only
mean that the Court deems redundant, and therefore
eliminates, the Congressional requirement that before a
plan can be approved, it must commend itself to the judgment of a class of creditors exercising the kind of judgment

R. F. C. v. DENVER & R. G. W. R. CO.
495

FRANKFURTER,

547

J., dissenting.

that men are entitled to exercise in the pursuit of their
legitimate self-interest, as well as commend itself to the
judicial sense of fairness.
In assuming that if a plan .seems .fair and equitable
to a court, rejection of it by any class must be unreasonable, the Court not only disregards the contrary assumption on the basis of which Congress legislated. Such an
attitude is also oblivious of the practicalities of the situation. To assume that if a court finds a plan is "fair and
equitable" no class of creditors can be reasonably justified
in rejecting it, is to assume that the ascertainment of
fairness concerning so complicated a situation as a plan
for a railroad's reorganization lies in the realm of even
approximate certitude. Quite the opposite is true. A
court in ascertaining whether a plan is fair and equitable
is not engaged in ascertaining indisputable facts. It is
forming a judgment, and largely a prophetic judgment,
*regarding a maze.of factors, and as to each factor there is
usually room for considerable difference of opinion. It
is for this reason that Congress made it a condition for
judicial approval of the plan that it appear fair and equitable in the voting system by the classes of creditors.
For an addition it was, made by Congress to the recommendation of the legislation by Commissioner Joseph
B. Eastman. As Federal Coordinator, he proposed to
Congress that a court be authorized to confirm the
reorganization plan despite the failure to obtain a
majority vote of one or more of the affected classes of
creditors, provided that the district court was satisfied in
two respects: (1) that the plan "makes adequate provision for fair and equitable treatment for the interests or
claims of those rejecting it"; and (2) that the judge was
satisfied that the plan is "fair and equitable" "even if not
so approved" by a class of creditors. See Coordinator's
Annual Report for 1934, pp. 101-102, 237,238.

548

328 U. S.

But Congress deemed it in the public interest to give
greater protection to the various classes of creditors than
the Coordinator suggested. In several respects Congress
limited the power of courts to disregard a class vote
against a plan beyond the safeguards proposed by the
Coordinator. For present purposes it is decisive to note
that Congress added to the protection formulated by the
Coordinator by requiring that a judge, after findi ng that
a plan is "fair and eepitable," must also be satisfied and
find that "such rejection is not reasonably justified in
the light of the respective rights and interests of those
rejecting it and all the relevant facts . . ." I cannot
escape the conclusion.that to hold, in the circumstances
of this case, that the General Bondholders were not reasonably justified in rejecting the plan is to decide that this
requirement, purposefully written into the law by Congress as an addition to the requirement that the judge
must find the plan to be "fair and equitable," is but a
meaningless repetition of that requirement.
The undesirability of further delay in taking this road
out of the District Court, where it has been for more than
a decade, is bound to press upon any court. But it ought
not lead to confirmation of a plan which fails to satisfy
the explicit prerequisites for approval laid down by Congress, particularly so where the result is as drastic as the
Circuit Court of Appeals and the expert Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce have made manifest.
See S. Rep. 1170, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 17-18, 40, 42,

Congress has not curtailed, nor shown any desire to
restrict, the right of self-protection which it gave to railroad creditors by the Act of 1935 and to which the result
of this case appears indifferent. On the contrary, Con-.
gress has since given decisive proof that it disapproved
the construction which courts have heretofore given to
§ 77, resulting in undue harshness to junior interests and
