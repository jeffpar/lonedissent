CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 361.

Argued March 25, 28, 1946.-Decided April 22, 1946.

1. The taxpayer, an operating company for the production of oil, was
assignee of a contract relating to oil land, whereby the grantee
agreed to pay to the grantor 50% of net profits from operations.
The contract required the grantee to drill promptly, to account for
production, and to sell the production to the grantor on specified
terms, if the grantor desired to purchase. The land owner and
the grantor's transferor retained underlying and overriding royalties. Held, under the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936, that the 50%
payments made by the taxpayer to the grantor were deductible
from the taxpayer's gross income. Pp. 26, 32.
2. The contract here involved could not properly be construed as a
sale, it was, rather, an assignment of the right to exploit the property, with a reservation in the assignor of an economic interest in
the oil. P. 37.
3. Ownership of a royalty or other economic interest in addition to
the right to net profits is not essential to make the possessor of a
right to a share of the'net profit the owner of an economic interest
in the oil in place. P. 32.

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered

the opinion of the Court.

The taxpayer, the petitioner here, is the operating company for the production of oil from Louisiana lands. The
taxpayer acquired a contract from J. G. Sutton, grantee
in the contract, that imposed upon the grantee the obligation to develop the oil land. For that purpose the contract
transferred to the grantee all oil rights previously obtained
by S. W. Sweeney by a lease from the owners of the land,
the Cameron Parish School Board. Through another
transaction the grantor in the Sutton contract, the Gulf
Refining Company of Louisiana, acquired these rights
from Sweeney. An underlying oil royalty was retained
by the School Board and an overriding oil royalty by
Sweeney. The contract between Gulf and Sutton required the grantee-operator, who is now this taxpayer,
to pay to the grantor, Gulf, 50% of the proceeds of the oil
produced and sold from the land, deducting from the proceeds certain itemized expenses of the producer. Those
expenses are so general in character that it may be said
fairly that Gulf was to receive 50% of the net from
operations.
The issue here is the correctness of the taxpayer's manner of handling this 50% net from operations, paid to
Gulf, in its return for federal income tax for its fiscal years
ending during 1936, 1937 and 1938 under the Revenue

Opinion of the Court.

Acts of 1934 and 1936. The taxpayer deducted these payments of 50% of net income from its income for each of
the years from the oil sold from the property. -It claimed
that Gulf retained an economic interest in the oil in place
to the extent of this 50% payment. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's inclusion of an amount equal to
these 50% payments in the taxpayer's gross income.
They were included by the Commissioner in the income on
the theory that the 50% payments represented capital
investment by the taxpayer. That is, they were a part of
the cost of the lease. 3 T. C. 1187. If this theory is correct, it is proper to add an equivalent sum, as the
Commissioner did, to the taxpayer's gross income.' The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Tax Court. BurtonSutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 150 F. 2d 621.
A decision on the category of expenditures to which
these 50% disbursements belong affects both the operators who make them and the owners, lessors, vendors,
grantors, however they may be classed, who receive them.
If they are capital investments to one, they are capital
sales td the other. If they are rents or royalties 'paid out

to one, they are rents or royalties received by the other.
The decision below conflicts in principle with Commissioner v. Felix Oil Co., 144 F. 2d 276. Kirby Petroleum
Co. v. Commissioner, 326 U. S. 599, involved payments
of a share of net income by a producer but differs from this
case because the lessor there was a landowner who reserved a royalty as well as a share in the net profits.

ture of an operator is or is not a rent, a royalty or an
ordinary business expense, but throw little light on what
is a rent or royalty.
In the Kirby case, we held that a payment of a share of
the net pr -fits from oil production by the operator to the
owner of the land was a rent or royalty and taxable to the
landowner as income from the oil property. Therefore
the owner could take from the payment the 271/2 per
centum allowance for-depletion provided by § 114 (b) (3).
The reason given in the Kirby case for holding that the
payment of a part of the net return from the property to
the landowner was a royalty or rent,' was that the owner
had a capital investment-an economic interest-in the
oil with a possibility of profit from that interest or investment solely from the extraction of the oil. As hereinbefore indicated, the landowner in the Kirby case had
retained also a one-sixth oil royalty and had received a
bonus. It was conceded that as both the bonus and the
royalty represented a return for the sale in part of the
lessor's investment in the oil in place, the lessor was entitled to depletion on both.'
The respondent urges that in the Kirby case it was the
lessor's economic interest in some of the oil itself, or its
proceeds, because of the bonus and royalty rights, which
made the net profit payments subject to depletion in the
4A
reading of § 114 (b) (3) shows that the "gross income from
the property" means income from the oil and gas wells on the property.

those payable for the privilege of extraction.

lessor's hands; that net profits received are not depletable
unless the recipient is entitled also to oil royalties.' Consequently, the Government contends that in this case
where there is only a share in profits due to the assignor,
Gulf, the Kirby case conclusion on the right to depletion
should not be extended but that the judgment below
should be affirmed on the ground that the profit payment
was a part of the purchase price. In dealing with the
operator's exclusion from gross income of agreed payments
to lessors or assignors of leases out of net profits and with
the lessor's or assignor's rights to depletion, the Tax Court
has not followed consistently the principle that a reserved
royalty is necessary to make a net profit payment depletable to the lessor and deductible from gross income from
the property by the operator.! A number of the Tax

present contention. This principle was that an obligation to pay a
part of net proceeds is a personal covenant of the obligor and was
the purchase price for the assignment. Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v.

1 In W. S..Green, 26 B. T. A. 1017, the lessor was allowed depletion
on a net income payment in addition to his royalty on the ground
that the net income payment was like a bonus.
In Marrs McLean, 41 B. T. A. 565, 573, which was decided after
the Elbe case, the Tax Court said a transfer of leases for cash and a
share of the profits was a sale.. Where only a three-fourths interest in
the lease was transferred and the transferor was to have one-fourth
of the net profits, depletion was allowed the assignor.
In Felix Oil Co., T. C. Docket No. 107148, decided December 18,
1942, a lessor corporation that had leased its oil lands for a cash payment plus 50% of the net profits as defined in the lease and no royalty,
was held to have "retained an interest in the oil in place" through its
ownership of the land. "Clearly, petitioner retained an interest in

the oil produced because it could compel the lessee to sell 50 percent
of the production elsewhere if it became dissatisfied with amounts
realized by the lessee." Memorandum op., p. 13. See Commissioner
v. Felix Oil Co., 144 F. 2d 277, affirming. Compare A. B. Innis, T. C.
Docket Nos. 2735-2736, June 29, 1945.
In Kirby Petroleum Co., 2 T. C. 1258, 1261, the Tax Court relied
on the latter ruling in Marrs McLean and held that the lessor could
deplete its net profits payment, as well as its royalty. It later explained this ruling as based on the Kirby Company's retention of a
"one-sixth oil royalty, thus reserving to itself an interest in the oil in
place." Estate of Dan A. Japhet,3 T. C. 86, 93.
In the Japhet case, depletion on net profits from an assignee's operation was denied an assignor of a lease who had received a cash payment
but had not reserved a royalty. It was said no "economic interest"
was reserved.
In A. B. Innis, T. C. Docket Nos. 2735-2736, June 29, 1945, a similar
problem arose as to deductibility by gold lease operators from their
gross income of a share in net profits paid to the sub-lessor of the
lease. The Tax Court found no difference between such a payment
to a sub-lessor and one to a lessor. Both were said to have economic
interests and therefore depletable rights. Felix Oil Co., supra, was
followed and Quintana, supra, distinguished as a sale by assignment
rather than sublease. Williams Bar Dredging Co. is in accord. T. C.
Docket Nos. 3284, 4074, June 30, 1945.
In Quintana Petroleum Co., 44 B. T. A. 624, an operator-assignee
acquired an cil lease by an agreement that called for payment by the
assignee to the assignor of one-fourth of the net proceeds from the
leased property with no reservation of royalty. The Board concluded that the assignment was a purchase and no deduction of the
amount of net profits paid was allowable. See also Quintana Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, 143 F. 2d 588.
In Euleon Jock Gracey, 5 T. C. 296, 302, decided June 21, 1945, the
Tax Court under similar circumstances followed Quintana and held
an operator-assignee was entitled to depletion on gross production
but could not exclude the net profit payment -to his assignee from
his gross, as the transfer of the lease, in consideration of a net profit
payment only, was a sale.

328 U. S.

Innis did not. We.do not agree with the Government that
ownership of a royalty or other economic interest in addition to the right to net profits is essential to make the possessor of a right to a share of the net profit the owner of
an economic interest in the oil in place. The decision in
Kirby did not rest on that point.
To let the character of the net profit payments turn
wholly on the ownership of a royalty of some sort by the
one who received the net profit would make the right to
depletion a form of words. No such mechanical application of a national tax act is desirable. Compare Burnet v.
Harmel, 287 U. S. 103, 110-11. This taxpayer's acquisition of Sutton's contract with Gulf places the taxpayer
in Sutton's situation as operator of the School Board
lease. The School Board and Sweeney, the original parties to the lease, unquestionably have royalties which
would compel a determination that net income payments
would be subject to depletion if paid to them in addition
to their royalties. It does not logically follow, it seems to
us, that the mere receipt of the net income payments by
different lessors or assignors can change the character of
the taxpayer's arrangements from leases to purchases.
It seems generally accepted that it is the owner of a
capital investment or economic interest in the oil in place
who is entitled to the depletion. Anderson v. Helvering,
310 U. S. 404, 407; Euleon Jock Gracey, 5 T. C. 296, 302;
Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, supra. Whether
the instrument creating the rights is a lease, a sublease or
an assignment has not been deemed significant from the
federal tax viewpoint in determining whether or not the
taxpayer had an economic interest in the oil in place.
Palmer v. Bender, 287 U. S. 551, 557, 558. Nor has the
title to the oil in place been considered by this Court as
decisive of the capital investment of the taxpayer in the

oil.' Technical title to the property depleted would ordinarily be required for the application of depletion or depreciation. It is not material whether the payment to
the assignor is in oil or in cash which is the proceeds of
the oil, Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, 293 U. S.312,
321, nor that some of the payments were in the form of a
bonus for the contract. Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U. S. 103,

gress, however, has recognized the peculiar character of the
business of extracting natural resources.' Leases are a
method of exploitation of the land for oil and payments
under leases are "income to the lessor, like payments of
rent." "o Receipts from oil sales are gross income to the
operator and subject to statutory deductions. Since lessors as well as lessees and other transferees of the right to

for equitable apportionment of the depletion

an existing inequality in the law or its administration:"3
In the present case, the assignor of the petitioner before

assignment had an economic interest in the oil in place
through its control over extraction. Under the contract
with petitioner, its assignor retained a part of this interest-fifty per cent of net. , Like the other holders of such
economic interest through royalties, the petitioner looked
to the special depletion allowances of § 114 (b) (3) to
return whatever capital investment it had. The cost of
that investment to the beneficiary of the depletion under
§ 114 (b) (3) is unimportant. Depletion depends only
upon production. It is the lessor's, lessee's or transferee's
"pQssibility of profit" from the use of his rights over production, "dependent solely upon the extraction and sale of

The inequality referred to under the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat.

the oil," which marks an economic interest in the oil. See
Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, supra, page 604.
Through retention of certain rights to payments from oil
or its proceeds in himself, each of these assignors of partial
exploitation rights in oil lands has maintained a capital
investment or economic interest in the oil or its proceeds.1
As the oil is extracted and sold, that economic interest in
the oil in place is reduced and the holder or owner of the
interest is entitled to his equitable proportion of the depletion as rent or royalty. The operator, of course, may
deduct such payments from the gross receipts.
Of course, such a transferor, whether the landowner or
any intermediate assignor, may completely divest himself of any interest, economic or otherwise, in the extraction of the oil. As the record shows no reservation of an
economic interest by Sutton, the assignee of Gulf and the
assignor of petitioner, he appears to have done so in this
case. See Helvering v. Elbe Oil Land Co., 303 U. S.372.
While, as pointed out above, the payment of proceeds in
cash, the form of the instrument of transfer and its effect
on the title to the oil under local law are not decisive of
the right to participation in depletion under §§ 23 (m) and
114 (b) (3), there must be a determination under federal
tax law as to "whether the transferor has made an absolute
sale or has retained" such economic interest as we have
just described in the preceding paragraph. Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, supra, page 606. We have
said that the instrument should be construed as a sale
when a large cash payment was made with a reserved payment that could be satisfied by future sales of the transferred property without extraction of the oil. Obviously
14 A participation in net profits disassociated from an economic interest does not enable a recipient of such profits to benefit from depletion.

there could be no depletion without extraction. Anderson v. Helvering, 310 U. S. 404, 412. On the other hand,
we have construed an assignment of oil leases for cash
and a deferred payment, "payable out of oil only, if, as
and when produced," as the reservation of an economic
interest in the oil-not a sale. Thomas v. Perkins, 301
U. S. 655.
The Government contends that Helvering v. Elbe Oil
Land Co., 303 U. S. 372, controls this case. The transfer
of the leases in Elbe was held an absolute sale. There the
transfer was for cash, deferred payments in cash, if the
assignee did not take advantage of a stipulation for abandonment, and a one-third interest in the net profits of
the assignee. It was further provided that Elbe, the assignor after the transfer, should have "no interest in or to
said properties," except in the case of an abandonment
of the property by the assignee. This provision for the
transfer of all interest of the assignor was emphasized
as a significant part of the agreement for transfer. The
issue upon which this Court passed was the classification
of the deferred payments. Were they gross income from
the property or receipts from a sale of the leases? These
deferred payments were not payable out of oil sales but
were payable absolutely, unless there was an abandonment. This Court concluded that the addition of a
provision for the payment of a share of net profits did not
qualify "in any way the effect of the transaction as an
absolute sale." Page 375. In view of what we have said
in this and in the Kirby Petroleum case as to the economic
interest in the oil of a recipient of a share of net profits,
the holding of Elbe should not be extended to the facts of
this agreemenc.
The assignor, Gulf, in the assignment here involved,

clause did not appear. in the Elbe contract. Such a transfer of rights to 'exploit could not, we think, properly be
construed as a sale. It is rather an assignment to the

Mn. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.
The tortuous process by which the result in this case has
evidently to be reached by the Court justifies calling attention again to the present unsatisfactory state of tax
litigation. It is of course idle to expect that the complexities of our economic life permit revenue measures to be
drawn with such simplicity and particularity as to avoid
much litigation. But it is not a counsel of perfection to
assume that a system of judicial oversight of fiscal administration can be devised sufficiently rational to avoid the
unedifying series of cases relating to income from oil
operations culminating, for the present at least, in this
case. The Court made a brave effort in Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489, to meet some of the difficulties of
the present distribution of judicial authority in tax cases
by lodging practical finality in a Tax Court decision unless
it invokes a "clear-cut mistake of law." Id. at 502. An
attempt to give adequate scope to such a doctrine of
judicial abstention by dealing with the practicalities of

tax matters instead of relying on the grab-bag concepts
of "law" and "fact" as a basis of review has not, however,
commended itself to the Court. See Trust of Bingham v.
Commissioner,325 U. S. 365.
To be sure. even the adoption of this view would not
make the Tax Court the Exchequer Court of the country
inasmuch as tax litigation can go through the district
courts as well as through the Tax Court. It would,
however, largely centralize review in the Tax Court of
Treasury determinations, assuming that the bulk of tax
litigation will continue to find its way to the Tax Court.
It is suggested that the Tax Court makes differentiations from case to case which to the uninitiated look suspiciously like conflicting opinions. But it is impossible to
escape nice distinctions in the application of complicated
tax legislation. And so far as over-nice distinctions are to
be made, I do not see that it helps the administration of
law for this Court rather than the Tax Court to make
them.
Nothing better illustrates the gossamer lines that have
been drawn by this Court in tax cases than the distinction
made in the Court's opinion between Helvering v. Elbe Oil
Land Co., 303 U. S. 372, and this case. To draw such
distinctions, which hardly can be held in the mind longer
than it takes to state them, does not achieve the attainable certainty that is such a desideratum in tax matters,
nor does it make generally for respect of law. Perhaps it
is inherent in the scheme which Congress has provided for
review of tax litigation that we have such an unsatisfactory series of decisions as those which are sought to be
reconciled by the present opinion. If so, then the call for
legislation voiced in responsible quarters to reform the
situation may well be heeded. See e. g., Griswold, The
Need for a Court of Tax Appeals (1944) 57 Harv. L. Rev.
1153.
