SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 510. Argued March 28, 29, 1946.-Decided June 10, 1946.
1. In a proceeding under § 338 of the Nationality Act of 1940 to revoke
an order admitting petitioner to citizenship and to cancel his certificate of naturalization on the ground of fraud in their procurement,
there was solid, convincing evidence that, before the date of his naturalization, at that time, and subsequently, he was a thoroughgoing
Nazi and a faithful follower of Adolph Hitler. Held. The conclusion is irresistible that, when petitioner forswore allegiance to the
German Reich, he swore falsely; and the revocation of the decreeof naturalization is sustained. Pp. 660-669, 674.

concurrent findings of the two lower courts as conclusive, but reexamines the facts to determine whether the United States has

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Knauer is a native of Germany. He arrived in this
country in 1925 at the age of 30. He had served in the
German army during World War I and was decorated.
He had studied law and economics in Germany. He settled in Milwaukee, W'isconsin, and conducted an insurance business there. He filed his declaration of intention
to become a citizen in 1929 and his petition for naturalization in 1936. He took his Qath of allegiance and was
admitted to citizenship on April 13,. 197. In 1943 the
United States instituted prooeedings under §_338 (a) of
the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1158, 8 U. S. C.
§ 738 (a), to cancel his certificate of naturalization' on
the ground that it had been secured by fraud in that (1)
he had falsely and fraudulently represented in his petition
that he was attached to the principles of the Constitution
and (2) he had taken a false oath of allegiance. The District Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
Knauer practiced fraud when he obtained his certificate
of naturalization. It found that he had not been and
is not attached to the principles of the Constitution and
that he took a false oath of allegiance. It accordingly
Sec. 338 (a) of the Nationality Act of 1940 provides:
"It shall be the duty of the United States distiict attorneys for
the respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings in any court specified in subsection
(a) of section 301 in the judicial district in which the naturalized
citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose
of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person
to citizenship and canceling the certificate of naturalization on
the ground of fraud or on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally procured."

entered an order cancelling his certificate and revoking.
the order admitting him to citizenship. The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed. 149 F. 2d 519. The case is
here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted
to examine that ruling in light of our decisions in
Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, and Baumgartnerv. United States, 322 U. S. 665.
I. In the oath of allegiance which Knauer took, he swore
that he would "absolutely and entirely renounce and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince,
potentate, state, or sovereignty, and particularly to the
German Reich," that he would "support and defend the
Constitution and laws of the United States of America
against all enemies, foreign and domestic"; that he would
"bear true faith and allegiance to the same" and that he
took "this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion."' 2 The first and crucial issue
in the case is whether Knauer swore falsely and committed
a fraud when he promised under oath to forswear allegiance to the German Reich and to transfer his allegiance
to this nation. Fraud connotes perjury, falsification,
concealment, misrepresentation. When denaturalization
is sought on this (Baumgartner v. United States, supra)
as well as on other grounds (Schneiderman v. United
States, supra), the standard of proof required is strict.
We do not accept even concurrent findings of two lower
courts as conclusive. Baumgartner v. United States,
supra,pp. 670-671. We reexamine the facts to determine
whether the United States has carried its burden of proving by "clear, unequivocal, and convincing" evidence,
which does not leave "the issue in doubt," that the citizen

who is sought to be restored to the status of an alien
obtained his naturalization certificate illegally. Schneiderman v. United States, supra, p. 158.
That strict test is necessary for several reasons. Citizenship obtained through naturalization is not a secondclass citizenship. It has been said that citizenship carries
with it all of the rights and prerogatives of citizenship
obtained by birth in this country "save that of eligibility
to the Presidency." Luria v. United States, 231 U. S.
9, 22. There are other exceptions of a limited character.'
But it is plain that citizenship obtained through naturalization carries with it the privilege of full participation
-in the affairs of our society, including the right to speak
freely, to criticize officials and administrators, and to promote changes in our laws including the very Charter of
our Government. Great tolerance and caution are necessary lest good faith exercise of the rights of citizenship
be turned against the naturalized citizen and be used co
deprive him of the cherished status. Ill-tempered expressions, extreme views, even the promotion of ideas which
run counter to our American ideals, are not to be given
disloyal connotations in absence of solid, convincing evidence that that is their significance. Any other course
would run counter to our traditions and make denaturalization proceedings the ready instrument for political
persecutions. As stated in Schneiderman, v. United
States, supra, p. 159, "Were the law otherwise, valuable
rights would rest upon a slender reed, and the security
of the status of our naturalized citizens might depend in

considerable degree upon the political temper of majority
thought and the stresses of the times."
These are extremely serious problems. They involve
not only fundamental principles of our political system
designed for the protection of minorities and majorities
alike. They also involve tremendously high stakes for
the individual. TFor denaturalization, like deportation,
may result in the loss "of all that makes life worth living."
Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U. S. 276, 284. Hence, where
the fate of a human being is at stake, we must not leave
the presence of his evil purpose-to conjecture. Cf. Bridges
v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135,149. Furthermore, we are dealing
in cases of this kind with questions of intent. Here it
is whether Knauer swore falsely on April 13, 1937. Intent
is a subjective state, illusory and difficult to establish in
absence of voluntary confession. What may appear
objectively to be false may still fall short of establishing
an intentional misrepresentation which is necessary in
order to prove that the oath was perjurious. And as
Baumgartner v. United States, supra, indicates, utterances made in years subsequent to the oath are not readily
to be charged against the state of mind existing when
the oath was administered. 322 U. S. p. 675. Troubled
times and the emotions of the hour may elicit expressions
of sympathy for old acquaintances and relatives across
the waters. "Forswearing past political allegiance without reservation and full assumption of the obligations of
American citizenship are not at all inconsistent with cultural feelings imbedded in childhood and youth." Baumgartner v. United States, supra, p. 674. Human ties are
not easily broken. Old social or cultural loyalties may
still exist, though basic allegiance is transferred here. The
fundamental question is whether the new citizen still
takes his orders from, or owes his allegiance to, a foreign
chancell6ry. Far more is required to establish that fact

than a showing that social and cultural ties remain. And
even political utterances, which might be some evidence
of a false oath if they clustered around the date of naturalization, are more and more unreliable as evidence of
the perjurious falsity of the oath the further they are
removed from the date of naturalization.
We have read with care the voluminous record in this
case. We have considered the evidence which antedates
Knauer's naturalization (April. 13, 1937), the evidence
which clusters around that date, and that which follows
it. We have considered Knauer's versions of the various
episodes and the versions advanced by the several witnesses for the United States. We have considered the
testimony and other evidence offered by each in corroboration or impeachment of the other's case. We have
considered the appraisal of the veracity of the witnesses
by the judge who saw and heard them and have given
it that "due regard" required by the Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 52 (a). We conclude with the District
Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals that there is
solid, convincing evidence that Knauer before the date
of his naturalization, at that time, and subsequently was
a thoroughgoing Nazi and a faithful follower of Adolph
Hitler. The conclusion is irresistible, therefore, that
when he forswore allegiance to the German Reich he swore
falsely. The character of the evidence, the veracity of
the witnesses against Knauer as determined by the District Court, the corroboration of challenged evidence presented by the Government, the consistent pattern of
Knauer's conduct before and after naturalization convince
us that the two lower courts were correct in their conclusions. The standard of proof, not satisfied in either the
Schneiderman or Baumgartner cases, is therefore plainly
met here.
We will review briefly what we, as well as the two lower
courts, accept as the true version of the facts.

KNAUER v. UNITED STATES.
654

Opinion of the Court.

As early as 1931, Knauer told a newly arrived immigrant
who came from the same town in Germany that in his
opinion the aim of Hitler and the Nazi party was good,
that it would progress, and that it was necessary to have
the same party in this country because of the Jews and the
Communists. During the same period, he told another
friend repeatedly that he was opposed to any republican
form of government and that Jewish capital was to blame
for Germany's downfall. He visited Germany for about
six months in 1934 and while there read Hitler's Mein
Kampf. On his return he said with pride that he had
met Hitler, and that he had been offered a post with the
German government at 600 marks per month, that Hitler
was the savior of Germany, that Hitler was solving the
unemployment problem while this country was suffering
from Jewish capitalism, that the Hitler youth organization
was an excellent influence on the children of Germany.
On occasions in 1936 and 1937 he was explosive in his
criticism of those who protested against the practices arid
policies of Hitler.
The7 German Winter Relief Fund was an official agency
of the German government for which German consulates
solicited money in the United States. In the winter of
1934-1935 Knauer was active in obtaining contributions
to the Fund and forwarded the money collected to the
German consulate in Chicago.
The German-American Bund had a branch in Milwaukee. Its leader was George Froboese-midwestern gauleiter and later national leader. The Bund taught and
advocated the Nazi philosophy-the leadership principle,
racial superiority of the Germans, the principle of the
totalitarian state, Pan-Germanism and of Lebensraum
(living space). It looked forward to the day when the
Nazi form of government would supplant our form of
government. It emphasized that allegiance and devotion
to Hitler were superior to any obligation to the United

States." Knauer denied that he was a member of the
Bund. But the District Court found to the contrary'
on evidence whieh is solid and convincing.
Knauer participated in Bund meetings in 1936. In the
summer of 1936 he and his family had a tent at the Bund
camps. In the fall of 1936 he enrolled his young daughter
in the Youth Movement of the Bund-a group organized
to instill the Nazi ideo.,gy in the minds of children of
German blood. They wore uniforms, used the Nazi
salute, and were taught songs of allegiance to Hitler.
Knauer attended meetings of this group.
The Federation of German-American Societies represented numerous affiliated organizations consisting of
Americans of German descent and sought to coordinate
their work. It was the policy of the Bund to -infiltrate
older German societies. This effort was made as respects
,'A number of denaturalization cases in the District Court raised
'the question as to the nature of the Bund. All of them were consolidated for trial on that single issue, including Knauer's case. At
the conclusion of the consolidated trial on that issue, Knauer's case
was separately tried. But the findings as to the nature of the Bund
were made on the basis of evidence in the consolidated trial. The
consolidation of the cases was challenged and upheld in the Circuit
Court of Appeals. 149 F. 2d p. 520. No such error is alleged here.
These findings by the District Court as to the nature of the Bund
are likewise not challenged here. For similar findings respecting the
nature of the Bund see United States v. Schuchhardt, 49 F. Supp. 567,
569; United States v. Ritzen, 50 F. Supp. 301, 302; United States v.
Haas, 51 F. Supp. 910, 911; United States v. Wolter, 53 F. Supp. 417,

11"I find as a fact that the defendant wis a member of the Milwaukee
unit of the Bund; that he was so considered by its officers and members; that most of his interests and activities were in behalf of the
Bund; and that, though completely aware of its aims and purposes,
he deliberately vigorously promoted the objects of the Bund."

the Federation. Knauer assisted Froboese and others
between 1933 and 1936 in endeavoring to have the swastika displayed at celebrations of the Federation. In 1935
Knauer reprimanded a delegate to the Federation for
passing out pamphlets opposing the Nazi government in
Germany. At a meeting of the Federation in 1935,
Knaue moved to have the Federation recognize the swastika as the flag of the German Reich. The motion failed
to carry. In 1936 the swastika flag was raised at a German
Day celebration without approval of the Federation. A
commotion ensued in which Bundists in uniform participated, as a result of which the swastika flag was torn
down. At the next meeting of the Federation, Knauer
proposed a vote indicating approval of the showing of
the swastika flag. The motion failed and a vote of censure of the chairman was passed. . The chairman resigned.
Thereupon Froboese and others proposed the formation
of the German-American Citizens Alliance to compete
with the Federation., It was organized early in 1937.
The constitution and articles of -incorporation of the Alliance provided that all of its assets on dissolution were
to become the property of a German government agency
for the dissemination of propaganda in foreign countriesthe Deusches Auslands-Institut. The Alliance was a
front organization for the Bund. It was designed to bring
into its ranks persons who were sympathetic with the
objectives of the Bund but who did not wish to be known
as Bund members.
On February 22, 1937-less than two months before
Knauer took his oath of' naturalization-he was admitted
to membership in the Alliance and became a member of
its executive committee. His first action as a member
was to volunteer the collection of newspaper articles that
attacked the Alliance, Germany, and German-Americans.
In 1937 and in the ensuing years, Knauer wrote many
letters ahd telegrams to those who criticized the Bund

or the German government. In 1938 Knauer was elected
vice-president of the Alliance and subsequently presided
over most of its meetings.. He was the dominant figure
in the Alliance. In May 1937 the German consul presented to the Alliance the swastika flag which had been
torn down at the Federation celebration the year before.
Not long after his naturalization Knauer urged that the
Alliance sponsor a solstice ceremony, a solemn rite at which
a wooden swastika is burned to symbolize the unity of
German people everywhere. . In August 1937 the Alliance
refused to participate in an affair sponsored by a group
which would not fly the swastika flag. In May 1938
Knauer at a meeting of the Alliance read a leaflet entitled
"America, the Garbage Can of the World." In 1939 he
arranged for public showings of films distributed by an
official German propaganda agency and depicting the
glories of Nazism.'
There was an intimate cooperation between the Alliance
and the Bund. The Bund camp was used for Alliance
affairs and it was available to Alliance members. The
Alliance supported various Bund programs. It supported
the.Youth Group of the Bund and the Bund's solstice
celebration. In 1939 the Youth Group of the Bund held
a benefit performance for the Alliance. In 1940 it ad6 In 1937 he said to one witness, an American of German ancestry,
"Now, isn't that wonderful what Hitler did over there? Don't you
like it? When the American Government would take the same line,
then it goes in Germany like Hitler did, that will be fine."
Before and after his naturalization he continuously preached the
Nazi concept of. racial unity among those of German blood. In 1937
he addressed members of the Alliance on the subject of the German
yolk, saying "With the rise and fall of the German nation, we rise
and fall."
In 1940 he said in conversation with another witness, in reply to.
the witness' remark that he was an American citizen, "I am a GermanAmerican." When told that there was no hyphen in the word, he

mitted the Youth Group of the Bund at the request of
Froboese. Knauer consistently defended the Bund when
it was criticized, when it was denied the use of a park or
a hall, when its members were arrested or charged with
offenses. In spite of the fact that Knauer knew the-real
aims and purposes of the Bund and was aware of its connection and Froboese's connection with the German government, he consistently came to its defense. Thus when
a Wisconsin judge freed disturbers of a Bund meeting,
he wrote the judge sayingthat the judge's remarks against
the Bund, were a "slander of a patriotic American organization." He subscribed to the official Bund newspaper
and to a propaganda magazine issued and circulated by
an agency of the German government. Re held shares
in the holding company of the Bund camp which was
started in 1939. A photograph taken at the dedication
of the new Bund camp in 1939 shows Knauer anng a
group of prominent Bund leaders with arm upraised in
the Nazi salute. - He owned a cottage at the Bund camp.
He used the Nazi salute at the beginning and end of his
speeches and at the Bund meetings.
In May 1938 Knauer and Froboese formed the.American Protective League with a secret list of members.
Knauer was elected a director. A constitution and byreplied, "I lean toward and favor th6 Germans." When asked if
he would fight for America if the Germans invaded this country, he
refused to answer, saying, "I am a German-American."
In 1941 the Wisconsin Federation of German-American Societies
pledged itself to uphold the Constitutioi, of the United States, to
maintain the democratic form of government, and to fight the totalitarian form of government and everything it stood for. Knauer issued
an appeal to German-Americans, stating that that declaration constituted open warfare against the then German government and was
a plan to create discord among Germans and to induce those in
Germany to revolt against the German Reich.

laws were adopted and copies mailed by Knauer and
Froboese to Hitler. One Buerk was a German agent
operating in this country and later indicted for failing
to register as such. In 1939 the German consulate in
Chicago supervised the recruiting of skilled workers in
that region for return to Germany for work in German
industries.. The German consul, Buerk, Froboese and
Knauer conducted the recruiting. Knauer Participated
actively in interviewing candidates. At intervals farewell parties were given by Knauer and Froboese to the
returning workers and their families.
Important evidence implicating Knauer in promoting
the cause of Hitler in this country was given by a Mrs.
Merton. She testified that, prompted solely by patriotic
motives, she entered the employ of Froboese in 1938 in
order to obtain evidence against the Bund and its members. The truth of her testimony was vigorously denied
by Knauer. 'But the District Court believed her version,
as did the Circuit Court of Appeals. And we are persuaded on a close reading of the record not only that
her testimony was strongly corroborated but also that
Knauer's attempts to discredit her testimony do not ring
true.7
Her testimony may be summarized as follows: She
acted as secretary to Froboese in 1938. During the period
of her employ Froboese and Knauer worked closely to1

The people whom Mrs. Merton at the time of her Woik for
Froboese told of her mission corroborated her. One of them on
occasion took her to the Froboese home and saw her enter. At the
time of the trial Froboese was dead. Mrs. Froboese denied that
Mrs. Merton had ever worked for Froboese or thatshe had ever
seen her. The testimony of another witness, however, related a
conversation with Mrs. Froboese in which she said that a Mrs. Merton
had worked for Froboese. Knauer persistently denied that he ever
saw or knew Mrs. Merton. But Mrs. Merton's husband and a
neighbor identified Knauer as the man who called on Mrs. Merton
at her home one day.

gether on Bund matters. He helped Froboese in the preparation of articles for the Bund newspaper, of speeches,
and of Bund correspondence. He helped Froboese prepare resolutions to be offered at the 1938 Bund convention
calling for a white-gentile-ruled Anr'ica. Wb n Froboese left the city to attend the convention, he told her
to contact Knauer for advice concerning Bund matters.
Letters signed by Froboese and Knauer jointly were sent
to Hitler and other Nazi officials. One contained a list
of 700 German nationals. One was the constitution and
by-laws of the American Protective League which we have
already mentioned. One to Hess said they had to lay
low for awhile, that there was an investigation on. A
birthday greeting to Hitler from Froboese and Knauer
closed with the phrase. "In blind obedience we follow
you." Knauer told her never to reveal that the Alliance
and the Bund were linked together. One day she asked
Knauer what the Bund was. His reply was that the Bund
"was the Fuehrer's grip on American democracy." She
reminded Knauer that he was an American citizen. He
replied, "That isa good thing to hide behind."
We have given merely the highlights of the evidence.
Much corroborative detail could be added. But what
we have related presents the gist of the case against
Knauer. If isolated parts of the evidence against Knauer
were separately considered, they might well carry different
inferences. His alertness to rise to the defense of Germans or of Americans of German descent could well reflect,
if standing as isolated instances, attempts to protect a
minority against what he deemed oppressive practices.
Social and cultural ties might be complete and adequate
explanations. Even utterances of a political nature which
reflected tolerance or approval of the Nazi program in
Germany might carry no sinister connotation, if they were
considered by themselves. For many native-borns in this
country did not awaken to the full implications of the

Nazi program until war came to us. And as we stated
in Schneidermanv. United States, supra, p. 139: "Whatever attitude we may individually hold toward persons
and organizations that believe in or advocate extensive
changes in our existing order, it should be our desire and
concern at all times to uphold the right of free discussion
and free thinking to which we as a people claim primary
attachment."
But we have here much more than political utterances,
much more than a crusade for the protection of minorities.
This record portrays a program of action to further Hitler's
cause in this nation-a program of infiltration which conforms to the pattern adopted by the Nazis in country
after country. The ties with the German Reich were too
intimate, the pattern of conduct too consistent, the overt
acts too plain for us to conclude that Knauer was merely
exercising his right of free speech either to spread tolerance
in this country or to advocate changes here.
Moreover, the case against Knauer is not constructed
solely from his activities subsequent to April 13, 1937the date of his naturalization. The evidence prior to his
naturalization, that which clusters around that date, and
that which follows in the next few years is completely
consistent. It conforms to the same pattern. We do
not have to guess whether subsequent to naturalization
he had a change of heart and threw himself wholeheartedly
into a new cause. We have clear, convincing, and solid
evidence that at all relevant times he was a thoroughgoing Nazi bent on sponsoring Hitler's cause here. And
this case, unlike the Baumgartner case, is not complicated
by the fact thAt when the alien took his oath Hitler was
not in power. On April 13, 1937, Hitler was in full command. The evidence is most convincing that at that time,
as well as later, Knauer's loyalty ran to him, not to this
country.

Opinion of the Court.

The District Court properly ruled that membership in
the Bund was not in itself sufficient to prove fraud which
would warrant revocation of a decree of naturalization.
Otherwise, guilt would rest on implication, contrary to
the rule of the Schneiderman and Baumgartner cases.
But we have here much more than that. We have a clear
course of conduct, of which membership in the Bund was
a manifestation, designed to promote the Nazi cause in
this country. This is not a case of an underling caught
up in the enthusiasm of a movement, driven by ties of
blood and old associations to extreme attitudes, and perhaps unaware of the conflict of allegiance implicit in his
actions. Knauer is an astute person. He is a leaderthe dominating figure in the cause he sponsored, a leading
voice in the councils of the Bund, the spokesman in the
program for systematic agitation of Nazi views. His

activities portray a shrewd, calculating, and vigilant promotion of an alien cause.

The conclusion seems to us

plain that when Knauer forswore allegiance to Hitler and
the German Reich he swore falsely.8
8The following finding or the District Court is a fair conclusion
from this record:
"The attachment of the defendant Knauer in the year 1931
to the aims and objects of Hitler's National Socialist movement,
his allegiance and attachment to the Third Reich as manifested
by his statements and his frequent use of the Nazi salute in
public, his devotion to and promotion of the display of the
swastika flag and ceremonies using it in symbolic pledge of fidelity
to the Reich, his fierce concern over the good name and honor
of the German race, his bitter and acrimonious denunciation of
everything which interfered with or stood in the way of the
fortunes of the German Reich, his belief in and advocacy of the
German racial concept of duty and obligation of all Germans
to the fatherland regardless of citizenship, his belief in and
attachment to the principles and concepts of National Socialism,
his espousal of the aims and objects of the German-American
Bund and his active participation therein for the promotion of
its aims and objects, his promotion and domination of the German-American Citizens Alliance to further the aims and objects
of the Bund, his uninterrupted effort by word and deed to polit-

II. It is said, however, that the issue of fraud may not
be tried in this case. An analogy is sought to be drawn
to those cases where relief against a prior judgment, on
the ground that perjured testimony was introduced at the
trial, was denied. United States v. Throckmorton, 98
U. S. 61, 66. And see Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing
Scale Co., 261 U. S.' 399, 421. But that rule goes no
further than to say that the issue of fraud can become
res judicata in the judgment sought to be set aside. We
need not consider the extent to which a decree of naturalization may constitute a final determination of issues of
fact, the establishment of which Congress has made conditions precedent to naturalization. Those facts relate
ically activate our German-American people in tht interests of
the German Reich, his persistent efforts among German-Americans, by means of charitable programs, speeches and movie films,
to revive in them a feeling of fidelity and loyalty to the German
Reich, the assistance he rendered to the consular representatives
of the Reich in the attainment of matters advancing German
interests,- his fervent devotion and blind attachment to the
Fuehrer at a time when the German Reich was hostile to the
United States, his lack of affection for or devotion to the United
States, his cynical evaluation of his own American citizenship,
as well as the evidence in its entirety, can be interpreted only
as establishing, and I so find, that the defendant at the time he
filed his petition for naturalization did not in good faith intend
to renounce absolutely and forever all allegiance and fidelity to
the German Reich, and at the time of his naturalization and
at all times thereafter the defendant did not in fact renounce
and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to the German Reich, but
intended to retain and did retain allegiance and fidelity to the
German government."
9At the time of Knauer's naturalization the Act provided:
"No alien shall be admitted to citizenship unless (1) immediately preceding the date of his petition the alien has resided
continuously within the United States for at least five years
and within the county. where the petitioner resided at the time
of filing his petition for at least six months, (2) he has resided
continuously within the United States from the date of his
petition up to the time of his admission to citizenship, and (3)
during all the periods referred to in this subdivision he has
behaved as a person of good moral character, attached to the
principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well

to the past-to behavior and conduct. But the oath is
in a different category. It relates to a state of mind and
is a promise of future conduct. It is the final act by
which an alien acquires the status of citizen. It requires
forswearing of allegiance in good faith and with no mental
reservations. The oath being the final step, no evidence
is heard at that time. It comes after the matters in issue
have been resolved in favor of the applicant for citizenship. Hence, no opportunity exists for the examiner or
the judge to determine if what the new citizen swore was
true, was in fact false. Hence, the issue of fraud in the
oath cannot become res judicata in the decree sought to.
be set aside. For fraud in the oath was not in issue in
the proceedings and neither was adjudicated nor could
have been adjudicated.
Moreover, when an alien takes the oath with reservations or does not in good faith forswear loyalty and allegiance to the old country, the decree of naturalization is
obtained by deceit. The proceeding itself is then founded
on fraud. A fraud is perpetrated on the naturalization
court. We have recently considered the broad powers of
equity to set aside a decree for fraud practiced on the
court which granted it. Hazel-Atlds Co. v. Hartford Co.,
322 U. S. 238. The present suit is an equity guit. Luria
v. United State8, supra, pp. 27-28. But we need not consider in this case what the historic powers of equity might
be in this situation. For Congress has provided that
fraud is a basis for cancellation of certificates of naturaldisposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.
At the hearing of the petition, residence in the county where
the petitioner resides at the time of filing his petition, and the
other qualifications required by this subdivision during such
residence, shall be proved by the oral testimony of at least two
credible witnesses, citizens of the United States, in addition to
the affidavits required by this Act to be included in the petition."

ization in proceedings instituted by the United States."
The legislative history of that enactment shows that false
swearing was one of the evils included in the statutory
grounds for denaturalization.1" That power was granted
10

By § 15 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 601, it was provided:

"That it shall be the duty of the United States district attorneys
for the respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause
therefor, to institute proceedings in any court having jurisdiction
to naturalize aliens in the judicial district in which the naturalized
citizen may reside at the time of bringing the suit, for the purpose
of setting aside and canceling the certificate of citizenship on the
ground of fraud or on the ground that such certificate of citizenship was illegally procured. .. ."
It was held in United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 325, that this
statutory power to cancel certificates of naturalization is broader
than that afforded in equity, independently of statute, to set aside
judgments.
n H. iep. No. 1789, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2:
"The conditions that have been revealed by special investigations
of the frauds committed. against the naturalization laws render
wholly unnecessary any argument upon the necessity at this
time of fully exercising all the authority in naturalization matters
conferred by the Constitution upon Congress."
"The worst and most glaring frauds have consisted in perjury,
false impersonation, and the sale and use of false and counterfeit
certificates of naturalization."
As stated by a sponsor of the measure on the floor of the House:
"The boon of American citizenship must not be cheapened by
lax and unconventional methods of courts and public officers
who administer the law, but once granted it should endure for
all time. It is conferred by the Federal -Constitution and by
laws authorized by the Constitution. When citizenship is once
legally granted, of course it can not be invalidated, and it ought
not to be, but no one questions that it is within the power of
the Government to provide for the cancellation of certificates
of citizens that have been fraudulently obtained. A certificate
tainted with fraud is in the sense of the law no certificate at all."
40 Cong. Rec. p. 7040.
The Court noted in United States v. Ness, 245 U. S. 319, 324, that
"widespread frauds in naturalization," including "the prevalence of
perjured testimony in cases of this character," led to the passage of
this legislation.

to give added protection against fraud committed on the
naturalization courts. United States v. Ness, 245 U. S.
319, 324, 327. Cancellation of a certificate on the grounds
of fraud includes cancellation for falsely swearing that
the applicant forswore allegiance to his native country.
Though the making of a false oath be called intrinsic fraud
(see United States v. Throckmorton, supra), it is within
the reach of the statute.
We have no doubt of the power of Congress to provide
for denaturalization on the ground of fraud. The Constitution grants Congress power "To establish an uniform
Rule of Naturalization ... ." Article I, § 8. The power
of denaturalization comes from that provision and the
"necessary and proper" Clause in Article I, § 8. See
Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S.568, 578. We do not
have here a case where, after an alien has been naturalized,
Congress provides new grounds which are invoked for cancellation of his certificate. Fraud-the basis of revocation with which we are now concerned-was a statutory
ground for denaturalization when Knauer took his oath.
Moreover, we are not faced with the question of what
limits there may- be to conditions for denaturalization
which Congress may provide. A certificate obtained by
fraud is clearly within the reach of congressional power.
As stated in Johannessen v. United States, 225 U. S. 227,
241: "An alien has. no moral nor constitutional right to
retain the privileges of citizenship if, by false evidence
or the like, an imposition has been practiced upon the
court, without which the certificate of citizenship could
not and would not iave been issued.' And see Luria v.
United States, supra, pp. 23-24; United States v. Ness,
supra, p. 327. To hold otherwise would be an anomaly.
It would in effect mean that where a person through concealnent, misrepresentation or deceit perpetrated a fraud
on the naturalization court, the United States would be

remediless to correct the wrong. That would indeed put
a premium on the successful perpetration of frauds against
the nation. We cannot conclude that Congress, which
may withhold the right of naturalization (Tutun v. United
States, supra, p. 578), is so powerless. We adhere to the
prior rulings of this Court that Congress may provide for
the cancellation of certificates of naturalization on the
ground of fraud in their procurement and thus protect
the courts and the nation against practices of aliens who
by deceitful methods obtain the cherished status of citizenship here, the better to serve a foreign master.
Since fraud in the oath of allegiance which Knauer took
is sufficient to sustain the judgment below, we do not reach
the other questions which have been argued.

I am satisfied- beyond all reasonable doubt, from the
testimony and admissions of the petitioner himself, made
in open court, that he had never at any time, either before
or after his naturalization, deviated from his wholehearted
allegiance to, and constant service of, the German Nazi
Government.
I realize, as the dissent in this case emphasizes, the
dangers inherent in denaturalizations. Had this judgment rested on the petitioner's mere philosophical or
political. beliefs, expressed or unexpressed, I should not
concur in its affirmance. But petitioner's admissions as
to his own conduct leave me in no doubt at all that he
was, even in obtaining naturalization, serving the German
Government with the same fanatical zeal which motivated

am unable to say that Congress is without constitutional
power to authorize courts, after fair trials like this one,
to cancel citizenship obtained by the methods and for the
purposes shown by this record.
dissenting.
For reasons I bhve suggested elsewhere,1 but which now
are squarely involved, I cannot bring myself to concur
in this judgment.
My concern is not for Paul Knauer. The record discloses that he has no conception of, much less attachment
to, basic American principles or institutions. He was a
thorough-going Nazi, addicted to philosophies altogether
hostile to the democratic framework in which we believe
and live. Further, he was an active promoter of movements directed to securing acceptance of those ideas here
and incorporating them in our institutions. And in this
case, by contrast with those of Schneiderman and Baumgartner,2 it would be hard to say that the evidence would
not sustain a finding that he falsely took the oath of
allegiance or that he never in his heart renounced his
prime fealty to Adolph Hitler and Nazi Germany. Nor,
in my opinion, can it be thought unequal to supporting
a conclusion that, from a time prior to his admission to
citizenship in 1935 until at any rate the assault on Pearl
Harbor, Knauer was in the active ser ,,ce of the Nazi
regime, promoting its cause here, and also for a short time
in Germany, as the object of his first loyalty.
If therefore in any case a naturalized citizen's right
and status can be revoked, by the procedure followed here

or perhaps at all, it would be in such a case as this. But
if one man's citizenship can thus be taken away, so can
that of any other. And even in this case it would be in
large part for his political convictions and acts done openly
in espousal of them. Not merely Knauer's rights, but
those of millions of naturalized citizens in their status and
all that it implies of security and freedom, are affected
by what is done in this case. By the outcome they are
made either second-class citizens or citizens having equal
rights and equal security with others.
No native-born American's birthright could be stripped
from him for such a cause or by such a procedure as has
been followed here. Nor could he be punished with banishment. To suffer that, great loss he must forfeit citizenship by some act of treason or felony and be adjudged
guilty by processes of law consistent with all the great
protections thrown around such trials. Not yet has
attempt been made to do this otherwise. Nor in my
opinion could it be done, except for some such cause or
by any less carefully safeguarded procedure.
In no instance thus far has our system tolerated destruction of that right of the native-born, except by voluntary
surrender, on account of convictions held, views expressed,
or acts done in promoting their acceptance falling short
of treason as defined in the Constitution ' or conviction
for felony. Nor has it thus far brought about that extinction by forms of trial other than those provided for such
offenses. Moreover, even in such cases, although the
penalty may be death or loss of the rights of citizenship,
we have not yet imposed those penalties altogether foreign
to our institutions, namely, deportation and exile. For
one cause and one only have they been provided, namely,
the loss of the naturalized citizen's status.

RUTLEDGE,

J., dissenting.

I do not find warrant in the Constitution for believing
that it contemplates two classes of citizens, excepting only
for two purposes. One is to provide how citizenship shall
be acquired, Const., Art. I, § 8; Amend. XIV, § 1, the
other to determine eligibility for the presidency. Const.,
Art. II, § 1. The latter is the only instance in which the
charter expressly excludes the naturalized citizen from
any right or privilege the native-born possesses. 4 Luria
v. United States, 231 U. S. 9, 22. I do not think there
is any other in which his status is, or can be made,
inferior.
Congress, it is true, is empowered to lay down the conditions for admission of foreign-born persons to citizenship. In this rspect it has wide authority. But it is
not unlimited. Noris Congress given power to take away
citizenship once it is conferred, other than for some sufficient act of forfeiture taking place afterward. Naturalized citizens 'are no more free to become traitors or
criminals than.others and may be punished as they are
when they commit the same offense. But any process
which takes away their citizenship for causes or by procedures not applicable to native-born citizens places them
in a separate and an inferior class. That dilemma is
inescapable, though it is one not heretofore faced squarely.
Unless it is the law that there are two classes of citizens,
one superior, th- other inferior, the status of no citizen
can be annulled for causes or by procedures not applicable
to all others.
To say that Ovngress can disregard this fact and create
inequalities of status as between native and foreign-born
citizens by attaching conditions to their admission, to be
applied retroactively after that event, is only to say in
4Cf.
Constitution, Art. I, § 3; Art. I, § 2, providing respectively
that no person shall be a Senator who shall not have been nine years
a citizen and, in the case of Representatives, seven years.

other words that Congress by using that method can create
different, and inferior, classes of citizens. We have heretofore pointed out why citizens with strings attached to
their citizenship, for its revocation, can be neither free
nor secure in their status. Schneiderman v. United
States, 320 U. S. 118, and concurring opinion at 165. All
that is said there, in that respect, applies here or to any
procedure by which citizenship may be annulled. In my
opinion the power to naturalize is not the power to denaturalize. The act of admission must be taken as final,
for any cause which may have existed at that time.
Otherwise there cannot but be two classes of citizens, one
free and secure except for acts amounting to forfeiture
within our tradition; the other, conditional, -timorous and
insecure because blanketed with the threat that some act
or conduct, not amounting to forfeiture for others, will
be taken retroactively to show that some prescribed condition had not been fulfilled and be so adjudged. I do
not think such a difference was contemplated when Congress was authorized to provide for naturalization and the
terms on which it should be granted.
But if I may be wrong in this, certainly so drastic a
penalty as denaturalization, with resulting deportation
and exile and all the attendant consequences, should not
be imposed by any procedure less protective of the citizen's
most'fundamental right, comprehending all others, than
must be employed to take away the native-born citizen's
status or the lesser rights of the foreign-born citizen. If
strings may be attached to citizenship and pulled retroactively to annul it, at the least this should be done only
'by those forms of proceeding most fully surrounded with
the constitutional securities for trial which are among the
prized incidents of citizenship. It is altogether anomalous
that those safeguards are thrown about the foreign-born

J., dissenting.

citizen when, for some offense, his liberty even for brief
periods is at stake, but are withdrawn from him when all
that gives substance to that freedom is put in jeopardy.
The right of citizenship is the most precious of all. The
penalty of denaturalization is always harsh. Often it
is more drastic than any other. It is also unique-for this
situation. For the required measure of security, the
native-born citizen can be deprived of his status only by
the rigidly safeguarded trial for treason or for conviction
of a criminal offense which brings loss of rights as a citizen.
To those procedures, with the same penalties and for the
same causes, the foreign-born citizen is subject; but also
by them he is protected. He should not be less secure
when it is sought to annul his citizenshii than when the
effort is to bring about its forfeiture. Nor, in either event,
should his procedural safeguards be less than when the
same consequence, in substance, is inflicted upon the citizen native born.
The procedure prescribed for and followed in this case
was not in accord with those standards. I think nothing
less is adequate, or consistent with the constitutional
status of citizenship, for the purpose of taking it away.
If this means that some or even many dislo: al foreignborn citizens cannot be deported, it is better so than to
place so many loyal ones in inferior status. And there
are other effective methods for dealing with those who
are disloyal, just as there are for such citizens by birth.
Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment.
