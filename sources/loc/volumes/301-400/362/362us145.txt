Under 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a)(1), a Federal District Court does not
have jurisdiction of an action by a taxpayer for refund of a part
payment made by him on an assessment for an alleged deficiency
in his income tax. The taxpayer must pay the full amount of
the assessment before he may challenge its validity in an action
under § 1346 (a) (1). Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63,
reaffirmed. Pp. 146-177.
(a) The language of § 1346 (a) (1) can more readily be construed to require payment of the full tax before suit than to permit
suit for recovery of a part payment. Pp. 148-151.
(b) The legislative history of § 1346 (a) (1) is barren of any
clue to the congressional intent on this issue; but that section is a
jurisdictional provision which is a keystone in a carefully articulated and quite complicated structure of tax laws; since enactment
of its precursor in 1921 Congress has several times acted upon the
assumption that § 1346 (a) (1) requires full payment before suit;
and any evidence of a contrary intent is too weak and insubstantial
to justify destroying the existing harmony of the tax statutes.

Pp. 151-158.
(c) In establishing the Board of Tax Appeals (now the Tax
Court), Congress acted upon the assumption that full payment of
the tax assessed was a condition precedent for bringing suit for
refund in a District Court, and it chose to establish the Board as
a different forum where the validity of an assessment could be
litigated without prior payment in full. Pp. 158-163.
(d) To permit such a suit in a District Court would be inconsistent with the purpose of § 405 of the Revenue Act of 1935, which
amended the Declaratoiy Judgment Act so as to except disputes
"with respect to Federal taxes." Pp. 164-165.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of
the Court.
The question presented'is whether a Federal District
Court ha§ jurisdiction under 28-U. S. C. § 1346 (a)(1) of
'a suit by a taxpayer for the refund of. income tax payments which did not discharge the entire amount of his
assessment.
This is our second consideration of the case. In the
1957 Term, we decided that full payment of the assessment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit, 357 U. S. 63.
Subsequently the Court granted a petition for rehearing.
360 U. S. 922. The case has been exhaustively briefed
and ably argued. After giving the prQblem our most
careful attention, we have concluded that our original
disposition of the case was correct.
Under such circumstances, normally a brief epilogue to
the prior opinion would be sufficient to account for our
decision. However, because petitioner in reargument has
placed somewhat greater emphasis upon certain contentions than he had previously, and because our dissenting
colleagueg have elaborated upon the reasons for their

disagreement, we deem it advisable to set forth our
reasoning in some detail, even though this necessitates
repeating much of what we have already said.
THE FACTS.

The relevant facts are undisputed and uncomplicated.
This litigation had its source in a dispute between petitioner and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue concerning the proper characterization of certain losses which
petitioner suffered during 1950. Petitioner reported them
as ordinary losses, but the Commissioner treated them as
'capital losses and levied a deficiency assessment in the
amount of $28,908.60, including interest. Petitioner paid
$5,058.54 and then filed with the Commissioner a claim
for refund of that amount. After the claim was disallowed, petitioner sued for refund in a District Court.
The Government moved to dismiss, and the judge decided
that the petitioner "should not maintain" the action
because he had not paid the full amount of the assessment.
But since there was a conflict among the Courts of Appeals
on this jurisdictional question, and since the Tenth Circuit had not yet passed upon it, the judge believed it
desirable to determine the merits of the claim. He thereupon concluded that the losses were capital in nature and
entered judgment in favor of the Government. 142 F.

agreed with the district judge upon the jurisdictional
issue, and consequently remanded with directions to
vacate the judgment and dismiss the complaint. 246

Appeals were in conflict with respect to-a question which

THE STATUTE.

The question raised in this case has not only raised a
conflict in the federal decisions, but has also in recent
years provoked controversy among legal commentators.2
In view of this divergence of expert opinion, it would be

surprising if the words of the statute inexorably dictated
but a single reasonable conclusion. Nevertheless, one of
the arguments which has been most strenuously urged is
that the plain language of the statute precludes, or at the
Very least strongly militates against, a decision that full
payment of the income tax assessment is a jurisdictional
condition precedent to maintenance of a refund suit in a
District Court. If this were true, presumably we could
but recite the statute and enter judgment for petitionerthough we might be pardoned some perplexity as to how
such a simple matter could have caused so much confusion.
Regrettably, this facile an approach will not serve.
Section 1346 (a)(1) provides that the District Courts
shall have jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of
Claims, of
"(1) Any civil action against the United States
for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged
to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected

States, 18 F. 2d 81 (C.A. 3d Cir.), semble.
2 As will appear later, prior to 1940 the general view was that
full payment was a jurisdictional prerequisite. But a substantial
difference of opinion arose after 1940, when the Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit decided Coates v. United States, 111 F. 2d
609, against the Government. See Riordan, Must You Pay Full
Tax Assessment Before Suing in the District Court? 8 J. Tax. 179;

without authority or any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws ....
"
(Emphasis
added.)
It is clear enough th-t the phrase "any internal-revenue
tax" can readily be construed to refer to payment of the
entire amount of an assessment. Such an interpretation
is suggested by the nature of the income tax, which is
"A tax . . . imposed for each taxable year," with the
"amount of the tax" determined in accordance with prescribed schedules.3 (Emphasis added.) But it is argued
that this reading of the statute is foreclosed by the presence in § 1346 (a)(1) of the phrase "any sum." This
contention appears to be based upon the notion that "any
sun" is a catchall which confers jurisdiction to adjudicate
suits for refund of part of a tax. A catchall the phrase
surely is; but to say this is hot to define what it catches.
The sweeping role which petitioner assigns these words is
based upon a conjunctive reading of "any internal-revenue tax," "any penalty," and "any sum." But we believe
that the statute more readily lends itself to the disjunctive reading which is suggested by the connective "or."
That is,. "any sum," instead of being related to "any
internal-revenue tax" and "any penalty," may refer to
amo. nts which are neither taxes nor penalties. Under
this interpretation, the function of the phrase is to permit
suit for recovery of items which might not be designated
as either "taxes" or "penaltis's" by Congress or the courts.
One obvious example of such a "sum" is interest. And
it is significant that many )ld tax statutes described the
amount wlich was to be assessed under certain circumstances as a "sum" to be added to the tax, simply as a
3See
I. R. C. (1954), §§ 1 (a), 1 (b)(1), 68A Stat. 5, 6. The same
general pattern has existed for many years. See, e. g., §§ 116, 117,
of the Act of June 30, 1864, c 173, 13 Stat. 281-282.

"sum," as a "percentum," or as "costs." ' Such a rendition of the statute, which is supported by precedent,5 frees
the phrase "any internal-revenue tax" from the qualifications imposed upon it by petitioner and permits it to
be given what we regard as its more natural rpading-the
full tax. Moreover, this construction, under which each
phrase is assigned a distinct meaning, imputes to Congress a surer grammatical touch than does the alternative
interpretation, under which the "any sum" phrase completely assimilates the other two. Surely a much clearer
statute could have been written to authorize suits for
refund of any part of a tax merely by use of the phrase
"a tax or any portion thereof," or simply "any sum paid
under the internal revenue laws." This Court naturally
does not review congressional enactments as a panel of
grammarians; but neither do we regard ordinary principles of English prose as irrelevant to a construction
of those enactments. Cf. Commissioner v. Acker, 361
U. S. 87.
We conclude that the language of § 1346 (a) (1) can
be more readily construed to require payment of the full
tax before suit than to permit suit for recovery of a part

payment. But, as we recognized in the prior opinion,
the statutory language is not absolutely controlling, and
consequently resort must be had to whatever other
materials might be relevant.'
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND.

Although frequently the legislative history of a statute
is the most fruitful source of instruction as to its proper
interpretation, in this case that history is barren of any
clue to congressional intent.
The precursor of § 1346 (a)(1) was § 1310 (c) of the
Revenue Act of 1921,' in which the language with which
we are here concerned appeared for the first time in a
jurisdictional statute. Section 1310 (c) had an overt purpose unrelated to the question whether full payment of an
assessed tax was a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit for
refund. Prior to 1921, tax refund suits against the United
Stwaes could be maintained in the District Courts under
the -authorityof the Tucker Act, which had been passed in
188'v. s Where the claim exceeded $10,000, however, such a
suit could not be brought, and in such a situation the taxpayer's remedy in District Court was against the Collector.
0 In

the prior opinion we stated that, were it not for certain

countervailing considerations, the statutory language "might . . . be
termed a clear authorization" to sue for the refund of part payment
of an assessment. 357 U. S., at 65. It is quite obvious that we
did not Tegard the language as clear enough to preclude deciding the case on other grounds. Moreover, it could at that time be
assumed that the terms of the statute favored the taxpayer, because
eight members of the Court considered the extrinsic evidence alone
sufficient to decide the case against him. Although we are still of
that opinion, we now state our views with regard to the bare words
of the statute because the argument that these words are decisively
against the Government has been urged so strenuously.

But because the Collector had to be sued personally, no
9
District Court action was available if he was deceased.
The 1921 provision, which was an amendment to the
Tucker Act, was explicitly designed to permit taxpayers
to sue the United States in the District Courts for sums
exceeding $10,000 where the Collector had died.".
The ancestry of the language of § 1346 (a)(1) is no
more enlightening thar is the legislative history of the
1921 provision. This language, which, as we have stated,
appeared in substantially its present form in the 1921
amendment, was apparently taken from R. S. § 3226
(1878). But § 3226 was not a jurisdictional statute
at all; it simply specified that suits for recovery of
taxes, penalties, or sums could not be maintained until
after a claim for refund had been submitted -to the
Commissioner."
Thus there is presented a vexing situation-statutory
language which is inconclusive and legislative history
which is irrelevant. This, of course, does not necessarily
mean that § 1346 (a) (1) expresses no congressional intent
with respect to the issue before the Court; but it does
make that intent uncommonly difficult to divine.
It is argued, however, that the puzzle may be solved
through consideration of the historical basis of a suit to
recover a tax illegally assessed. The argument proceeds
as follows: A suit to recover taxes could, before the Tuicker

10 See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 486, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 57; remarks
of Senator Jones, 61 Cong. Rec. 7506-7507. Another amendment was
added in 1925 giving the right to bring refund suits against the United
States where the Collector was out of office. 43 Stat. 972. And in
1954, both the $10,000 limitation and the limitation with respect to
the Collector being dead or out of office were eliminated. 68 Stat. 589.
"The text of R. S. § 3226 is set forth in note 16, infra, together
with a more detailed account of the origin and development of the
pertinent statutory language. The successor of R. S. § 3226 is I. R. C.

Act, be brought only against the Collector. Such a suit
was based upon the common-law count of assumpsit for
money had and received, and the nature of that count
requires the inference that a suit for recovery of part payment of a tax could have been maintained. Neither the
Tucker Act nor the 1921 amendment indicates an intent to
change the nature of the refund action in any pertinent
respect. Consequently, there is no warrant for importing
into § 1346 (a) (1) a full-payment requirement.
For reasons which will appear later, we believe that the
conclusion would not follow even if the premises were
clearly sound. But in addition we have substantial doubt
about the validity of the premises. As we have already
indicated, the language of the 1921 amendment does in
fact tend to indicate a congressional purpose to require
full payment as a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit for
refund. Moreover, we are not satisfied that the suit
against the Collector was identical to the common-law
action of assumpsit for money had and received. One
difficulty is that, because of the Act of February 26, 1845,
c. 22, 5 Stat. 727, which restored the right of action against
the Collector after this Court had.held that it had been
implicitly eliminated by other legislation, 2 the Court no
longer regarded the suit as a common-law action, but
rather as a statutory remedy which "in its nature [was]
a remedy against the Government." Curtis's Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 479. On the other hand,
it is true that none of the statutes relating to this type of
suit clearly indicate a congressional intention to require
full payment of the assessed tax before suit." Nevertheless, the opinion of this Court in Cheatham v. United
States, 92 U. S. 85, prevents us from accepting the

analogy between the statutory action against the Collector and the common-law count. In this 1875 opinion,
the Court described the remedies available to taxpayers
as follows:
"So also, in the internal-revenue department, the
statute which we have copied allows appeals from
the assessor to the commissioner of internal revenue;
and, if dissatisfied with his decision, on paying the
tax the party can sue the collector; and, if the money
was wrongfull; exacted, the courts will give him
relief by a judgment, which the United States pledges
herself to pay.
... While a free course of remonstrance and
appeal is allowed within the departments before the
money is finally exacted, the general government has
wisely made the payment of the tax claimed, whether
of customs or of internal revenue, a condition precedent to a resort to the courts by the party against
whom the tax is assessed. . . . If the compliance
with this condition [that appeal must be made to the
Commissioner and suit brought within six months
of his decision] requires the party aggrieved to
pay the money, he must do it. He cannot, after the
decision is rendered against him, protract the time
within which he can contest that decision in the
courts by his own delay in paying the money. It
is essential to the honor and orderly conduct of the
government that its taxes should be promptly paid,
and drawbacks speedily adjusted; and the rule
prescribed in this class of cases is neither arbitrary
nor unreasonable. . ..
"The objecting party can take his appeal. He can,
if the decision is delayed beyond twelve months,

Opinion of the Court.

rest his case on that decision; or he can pay the
amount claimed, and commence his suit at any time
within that period. So, after the decision, he can
pay at once, and commence suit within the six
months . . . ." 92 U. S., at 88-89. (Emphasis
added.)
Reargument has not changed our view that this language reflects an understanding that full payment of the
tax was a prerequisite to suit. Of course, as stated in
our prior opinion, the Cheatham statement is dictum; but
we reiterate that it appears to us to be "carefully considered dictum," 357 U. S., at 68. Equally important is
the fact that the Court was construing the claim-forrefund statute from which, as amended, the language of
§ 1346 (a)(1) was presumably taken.t
Thus it seems
that in Cheatham the Supreme Court interpreted this
language not only to specify which claims for refund must
first be presented for administrative reconsideration,
but also to constitute an additional qualification upon the
statutory right to sue the Collector. It is true that the
version of the provision involved in Cheatham contained
only the, phrase "any tax." But the phrases "any penalty" and. "any sum" were added well before the decision
in Cheatham; " the history of these amendments makes
it quite clear that they were not designed to effect any
change relevant to the Cheatham rule; 16 language in

15 Cheatham was decided in 0. T. 1875, while the phrases in

amendment.

assessed or collected, until appeal shall have been duly made to the
commissioner of internal revenue ......
The phrases "any penalty" and "'an), sum" were first introduced
into the statute in § 44 of the Act of June 6, 1872, c. 315, 17 Stat.
257-258, which read as follows:
"SEc. 44. That all suits and proceedings for the recovery of any
internal tax alleged to have been erroneously assessed or collected,
or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority,
or for any sum which it is alleged was excessive, or in any manner
wrongfully collected, shall be brought within-two years next after the
cause of action accrued and not after; and all claims for the refunding of any internal tax or penalty shall be presented to the commissioner of internal revenue within two years next after the cause
of action accrued and not after . . . ." (Emphasis added.)
A careful r~ading of this statute discloses the absurd result which
would flow from construing the addition of the "any sum" language
to affect the full-payment rule, which, under this argument, would
be based upon the "any tax" phrase in the 1866 statute. That is,
since the "any sum" phrase occurs only in the statute of limitations
portion of the 1872 statute, and not in the claim-for-refund provision,
a person would be able to bring a suit for part payment without filing
a claim for refund.
There were no material changes in R. S. § 3226, which provided:
"SEC. 3226. No suit shall be maintained in any" court for the
recovery of any internal tax alleged to have been erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed tb have
been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to hare
been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until appeal
shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of . . . Internal
Revenue ....
It is no doubt true, as petitioner says, that these various amendments were designed to require submission of all litigable claims to
the Commissioner; but, as we have explained, this indicates no more
than an intent to cover taxes, penalties, and sums which might,
strictly speaking, be neither taxes nor penalties.

Opinion of the Court.

If this were all the material relevant to a construction
of § 1346 (a) (1), determination of the issue at bar would
be inordinately difficult. Favoring petitioner would be
the theory that, in the early nineteenth century, a suit for
recovery of part payment of an assessment could be maintained against the Collector, together with the absence
of any conclusive evidence that Congress has ever
intended to inaugurate a new rule; favoring respondent
would be the Cheatham statement and the language of
the 1921 statute. There are, however, additional factors
which are dispositive.
We are not here concerned with a single sentence in an
isolated statute, but rather with a jurisdictional provision
which is a keystone 'in a carefully articulated and quite
complicated structure of tax laws. From. these related
statutes, all of which were passed after 1921, it is apparent
that Congress has several times acted upon the assumption that § 1346 (a) (1) requires full payment before suit.
Of course, if the clear purpose of Congress at any time had
been to permit suit to recover a part payment, this subsequent legislation would have to be disregarded. But,
as we have stated, the evidence pertaining to this intent
to law and the regulations until after the taxes have been paid ...

have paid the amount assessed under protest and then brought suit
against the Collector . . ... "). This view of Cheatham also corresponds to that of the Court of Appeals in this case. 246 F. 2d, at

is extremely weak, and we are convinced that it is entirely
too insubstantial to justify destroying the existing harmony of the tax.statutes. The laws which we consider
especially pertinent are the statute establishing the Board
of Tax Appeals (now the Tax Court), the Declaratory
Judgment Act, and § 7422 (e) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954.
THE BOARD OF TAx APPEALS.

The Board of Tax Appeals was established by Congress
in 1924 to permit taxpayers to secure a-determination of
tax liability before payment of the deficiency."8 The
Government argues that the Congress which passed this
1924 legislation thought full payment of the tax assessed
was a condition for bringing suit in a District Court; that
Congress believed this sometimes caused hardship; and
that Congress set up the Board to alleviate that hardship.
Petitioner denies this, and contends that Congress' sole
purpose was to enable taxpayers to prevent the Government from collecting taxes by exercise of its power of
distraint.'
We believe that the legislative history surrounding both
the creation of the Board and the subsequent revisions
of the basic statute supports the Government. The
House Committee Report, for example, explained the
purpose of the bill as follows:
"The committee recommends the establishment of
a Board of Tax Appeals to which a taxpayer may
appeal prior to the payment of an additional assessment of income, excess-profits, war-profits, or estate
taxes.. Although a taxpayer may, after payment of

his tax, bring suit for the recovery thereof and thus
secure a judicial determination on the questions
involved, he can not, in view of section 3224 of the
Revised Statutes, which prohibits suits to enjoin the
collection of taxes, secure such a determination prior
to the payment of the tax. The right of appeal after
payment of the tax is an incomplete remedy, and does
little to remove the hardship occasioned by an incorrect assessment. The payment of a large additional
tax on income received several years previous and
which may have, since its receipt, been either wiped
out by subsequent losses, invested in nonliquid assets,
or spent, sometimes forces taxpayers into bankruptcy,
and often causes great financial hardship and sacrifice. These results are not remedied by permitting
the taxpayer to sue for the recovery of the tax after
this payment. He is entitled to an appeal and to a
determination of his liability for the tax prior to its
payment." 20 (Emphasis added.)
Moreover, throughout the congressional debates are to
be found frequent expressions of the principle that payment of the full tax was a precondition to suit: "pay his
tax . . . then . . . file a claim for refund"; "pay the tax
and then sue"; "a review in the courts after payment of
the tax"; "he may still seek court review, but he must
first pay the tax assessed"; "in order to go to court he
must pay his assessment"; "he must pay it [his assessH. R. Rep. No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 7. The Senate Committee on Finance filed a similar report. S. Rep. No. 398, 68th Cong.,

The reference to R. S. § 3224 in the House Report clearly was
meant simply to demonstrate that a determination prior to payment
by way of an injunction suit was not possible because of the statutory
bar to such a suit. This anti-injunction provision has been law for
many decades. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, c. 169, § 10, 14 Stat. 475.

court"; "pay the tax . . . [t]hen . . . sue to get it
back"; "paying his tax and bringing his suit"; "first pay
his tax and then sue to get it back"; "take his case to the
district court-conditioned, of course, upon his paying the
assessment." 21
Petitioner's argument falls under the weight of this
evidence. It is true, of courlse, that the Board of Tax
Appeals procedure has the effect of staying collection,22
and it may well be that Congress so provided in order to
alleviate hardships caused by the long-standing bar
against suits to enjoin the collection of taxes. But it
is a considerable leap to the further conclusion that
amelioration of the hardship of prelitigation payment as
a jurisdictional requirement was not another important

As we have indicated, some of these remarks were made during
debates over proposed changes in the Board of Tax Appeals legislation during the middle of the 1920's, but they all reflect Congress'
understanding of the pre-1924 procedure and of the changes which
were made by establishment of the Board. For example, shortly after
the -Board legislation was passed, Congress considered and rejected
a proposal to make appeal to the Board and then to a Circuit Court
of Appeals the taxpayer's sole remedy. In the course of the debate,
a number of Senators discussed at length the taxpayer's right to
bring a refund action in court. Some of the cited quotations are
taken from that debate. The following remark of Senator Fletcher
is also illuminating:
I think the most important right that is
"Mr. FLETCHER ....
preserved here .. .is- the right to go into the district court by the
taxpayer upon the payment of the tax. I do not think that we ought
to allow him to do t'hat unless he does pay the tax; but when he
pays the tax his right to go into the district court is preserved."

motivation for Congress' action.23 To reconcile the legislative history with this conclusion seems to require the
presumption that all the Congressmen who spoke of
payment of the assessment before suit as a hardship
understood-without saying-that suit could be brought
for whatever part of the assessment had been paid, but
believed, that, as a practical matter, hardship would nonetheless arise because the Government would require payment of the -balance of the tax by exercising its power of
6:straint. But if this was in fact the view of these legislators, it is indeed extraordinary that they did not say so.14
23 In Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U. S. 716, 721,
this Court expressed the view that the Board "was created by Congress to provide taxpayers an opportunity to secure an independent
review . . . in advance of their paying the tax found by the Commissioner to be due. Before the Act of 1924 the taxpayer could only
contest the Commissioner's determination of the amount of the tax
after its payment."
24 There
are a few interchanges among Senators which might
be construed to indicate that they were thinking in terms of preventing distraint, but the same passages demonstrate even more
clearly that these Senators also intended to eliminate the necessity of full payment as a prerequisite to suit. For example, the
following debate occurred when Senator Reed, who was a member
of the Committee on Finance, proposed an amendment which would
have permitted a taxpayer to refuse to pay the deficiency even after
the Board had ruled against him and which would have required
the Government to sue in a District Court.
"Mr. REED of Missouri. ...

"The practice, as I understand it, has been to require the taxpayer
to pay in the amount of the increased assessment, and then to allow
him to get it back if he can. Ii addition to this, distraints frequently
have been issued seizing the property of the citizen .... .
"Mr. SWANSON. What are the pr6cesses by which a citizen who
has overpaid can get back his money under the existing law?
"Mr. REED of Missouri. As I understand it, he pays his tax.
Then he makes an application for a return of it. That is heard

Moreover, if Congress' only concern was to prevent distraint it is somewhat difficult to understand why Congress
did ot simply authorize injunction suits. It is interesting to n.ote in this connection that bills to permit the same
type of prepayment litigation in the District Courts as is
through the long, troublesome processes which exist . . . . When the
Treasury is satisfied . . . the taxpayer can go into court at that
time. In the meantime, however, he has had to pay his money.
"Mr. SWANSON. Does the Senator mean that if there is a dispute, the tax is not assessed permanently against him until the board
reaches its final decision?
"Mr. SMOOT. Until the board of appeals finally passes upon it,
and after that if he wants to go to court he can do so, but in order
to go to court he must pay his assessment.
"Mr. REED of Missouri. He must pay it before he can have a
trial in court.
"Mr. WALSH of Montana.

Mr. President, the hardships . . . in
connection with the collection of these taxes is a very real one ....
At least two or three instances have come under my notice, and my
assistance has been asked in cases where the assessing officers
have . . . assessed against the [taxpayer] delinquent taxes of such
an amount that he found it impossible to pay in advance and secure
redress through the ordinary proceeding in a court of law, simply
because it would bankrupt him to endeavor to raise the money. He
was therefore obliged to suffer a distraint.
After the board of review determines the matter, it seems to
me, that is as far as the Government ought to be interrupted in the
matter of the collection of its revenues. Then the taxpayer would
be obliged to pay the tax and take his ordinary action at law to
recover whatever he claims was exacted of him illegally." 65 Cong.
Rec. 8109-8114.
A somewhat similar exchange occurred during the 1926 debate
over a proposal to pfohibit refund suits where an appeal had been
taken to the Board.
"Mr. REED of Missouri ....
Now just one further question:
"Why is it that a taxpayer can not be given his day in court by
direct action, without first requiring him to pay the tax that is
assessed? I know I shall be met with the statement that it would

possible in the Tax Court have been introduced several
times, but none has ever been adopted.2"
In sum, even assuming that one purpose of Congress in
establishing the Board was to permit taxpayers to avoid
distraint, it seems evident that another purpose was to
furnish a forum where full payment of the assessment
would not be a condition precedent to suit. The result
is a system in which there is one tribunal for prepayment
litigation and another for post-payment litigation, with
no room contemplated for a hybrid of the type proposed
by petitioner.
mean interminable delay to the Government: but it frequently happens that the tax that is assessed is ruinous, and that the taxpayer
can not raise the money ...
"In my own personal experience I have had two clients who were
absolutely ruined by assessments that were unjust and that could
not have stood up in a court of justice. . . . [Alnd it was no protection to them to say, 'Pay your taxes and then go into court,'
because they did not have the money to pay the taxes and could
not raise the money to pay the taxes and be out of the money two
or three years.
I think the bill needs just one more amendment in this particular, and that is a provision that any citizen can go into court
without paying any tax and resist the payment. In the meantime I
agree that the Government for its own protection ought to be allowed,
perhaps, in such a case as that to issue a distraint. But the idea that
a man must first pay his money and then sue to-get it back is
anomaly in the law." 67 Cong. Rec. 3530-3533:'
Senator Reed later proposed that the appeal from the Board be
to the District Court instead of to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and
Senator Wadsworth, a member of the Finance Committee, asked:
"Does the Senator not think that other provision in the bill which
permits the taxpayer to take his case to the district court-conditioned, of course, upon his paying the assessment-meets the situation?" 67 Cong. Rec. 3755.

THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT.

The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934 2 was
amended by § 405 of the Revenue Act of 1935 expressly to
except disputes "with respect to Federal taxes." 27 The
Senate Report explained the purpose of the amendment
as follows: •
"Your committee has added an amendment making it clear that the Federal Declaratory Judgments
Act of June 14, 1934, has no application to Federal
taxes. The application of the Declaratory Judgments Act to taxes would constitute a radical departure from the long-continued policy of Congress (as
expressed in Rev. Stat. 3224 and other provisions)
with respect to the determination, assessment, and
collection of Federal taxes. Your committee believes
that the orderly-and prompt determination and collection of Federal taxes should not be interfered with
by a procedure designed to facilitate the settlement
of private controversies, and that existing procedure
both in the Board of Tax Appeals and the courts
affords ample remedies for the correction of tax
errors." 28 (Emphasis added.)
It is clear enough that one "radical departure" which
was averted by the amendment was the potential circumvention of the "pay first and litigate later" rule by way
of suits for declaratory judgments in tax cases.2 1 Peti26 48 Stat. 955, as amended, 28 U. S. C. §§ 2201, 2202.

S. Rep. No. 1240, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 11.
29 "Should the Declhratory Judgment Act be held to apply to tax
cases it will mean a complete reversal of our present scheme of taxation. The principle of 'pay first and litigate later' will be changed
to 'litigate first and pay later.' This principle has never before been
departed from." Wideman, Application of the Declaratory Judgment Act to Tax Suits, 13 Taxes 539, 540.

tioner would have us give this Court's imprimatur to
precisely the same type of "radical departure," since a
suit for recovery of but a part of an assessment would
determine the legality of the balance by operation of the
principle of collateral estopel. With respect to this
unpaid portion, the taxpayer would be securing what is
in effect-even though not technically-a declaratory
judgment. The frustration of congressional intent which
petitioner asks us to endorse could hardly be more glaring,
for he has conceded that his argument leads logically to
the conclusion that payment of even $1 on a large assessment entitles the taxpayer to sue-a concession amply
warranted by the obvious impracticality of any judicially
created jurisdictional standard midway between full
payment and any payment.
SECTION

7422 (e)

OF THE

1954

CODE.

'One distinct possibility which would emerge from a
decision in favor of petitioner would be that a taxpayer
might be able to split his cause of action, bringing suit for
refund of part of the tax in a Federal District Court and
litigating in the Tax Court with respect to the remainder.
In such a situation the first decision would, of course, control. Thus if for any reason a litigant would prefer a
District Court adjudication," he might sue for a small
portion of the tax in that tribunal while at the same time
protecting the balance from distraint by invoking the
protection of the Tax Court procedure. On the other
hand, different questions would arise if this device were
not employed. For example, would the Government be
required to file a compulsory counterclaim for the unpaid

Section 7422 (e) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code
makes it apparent that Congress has assumed these problems are nonexistent except in the rare case where the
taxpayer brings suit in a District Court and the Commissioner then notifies him of an additional deficiency.
Under § 7422 (e) such a claimant is given the option of
pursuing his suit in the District Court or in the Tax Court,
but he cannot litigate in both. Moreover, if he decides to
remain in the District Court, the Government may-but
seemingly is not required to-bring a counterclaim; and
if it does, the taxpayer has the burden of proof.32 If ve

were to overturn the assumption upon which Congress has
acted, we would generate upon a broad scale the very
problems Congress believed it had solved."
These, then, are the basic reasons for our decision, and
our views would be unaffected by the constancy or inconstancy of administrative practice. However, because the
petition for rehearing in this case focused almost exclusively upon a single clause in the prior opinion-"there
does not appear to be a single case before 1940 in which
a taxpayer attempted a suit for refund of income taxes
without paying the full amount the Government alleged
to be due," 357 U. S., at 69-we feel obliged to comment
upon the material introduced upon reargument. The
otherwise expired. The taxpayer shall have the burden of proof
with respect to the issues raised by such counterclaim or intervention of the United States except as to the issue of whether the
taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax. This
subsection shall not apply to a suit by a taxpayer which, prior to the
date of enactment of thig title, is commenced, instituted, or pending
in a district court or the Court of Claims for the recovery of any
income tax, estate tax, or gift tax (or any penalty relating to such
taxes)." 68A Stat. 877.
The possibility of dual jurisdiction in this type of situation was confirmed by cases such as Camp v. United States, 44 F. 2d 126, and
Ohio Steel Foundry Co. v. United States, 69 Ct. Cl. 158, 38 F. 2d 144.
See H..R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 109, A431; S. Rep.

33 For additional evidence of recent congressional understanding
of the jurisdictional requirement of § 1346 (a) (1), see the House
Report which explained the 1954 amendment abolishing the $10,000
limitation on tax suits against the United States, 68 Stat. 589. After
explaining the taxpayer's right to contest a deficiency in the Tax
Court, the report states: "The taxpayer may, however, elect to pay
his tax and thereafter bring suit to recover the amount claimed to
have been illegally exacted." H. R. Rep. No. 659, 83d Cong., 1st

reargument has, if anything, strengthened, rather than
weakened, the substance of this statement, which was
directed to the question whether there has been a consistent understanding of the "pay first and litigate later"
principle by the interested government agencies and by
the bar.
So far as appears, Suhr v. United States, 18 F. 2d 81,
decided by the Third Circuit in 1927, is the earliest case in
which a taxpayer in a refund action soug,,t to contest an
assessment without having paid the full amount then
due." In holding _that the District Court had no
jurisdiction of the action, the Court of Appeals said:
"None of the various tax acts provide for recourse
to the courts by a taxpayer until he has failed to get
relief from the proper administrative body or has
paid all the taxes assessed against him. The payment of a part does not confer jurisdiction upon the
courts. . . . There is no provision for refund to the
taxpayer of any excess payment of any installment
or part of his tax, if the whole tax for the year has
not been paid." Id., at 83.
34 PPhtitioner cites two earlier cases in which the Government failed
to raise the jurisdictional issue. Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co.,
27. U. S.170 (1926); Cook v. Tait, 265 U. S.47 (1924). The Governmnt distinguishes these cases on the ground that, although the
total tax for the year had not been paid, the full amount due at the
time of suit had been paid. This situation occurred because under
§ 250 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 264, the tax
was paid in four installments, and the plaintiffs in Cook and Bowers
apparently had paid the due installments. While we do not suggest that the statute will support this type of distinction, adoption
of it by the Government or by the bar would not in any way
impair the substantial consistency of the view that full payment
has for many decades been a prerequisite to suit in District Court.
An error as to the applicability of a principle to a unique factual
situation does not mean that the principle itself has been rejected.

Opinion of the Court.

Although the statement by the court might have been
dictum, 5 it was in accord with substantially contemporaneous statements by Secretary of the Treasury A. W.
Mellon, by Under Secretary of the Treasury Garrard B.
Winston, by the first Chairman of the Board of Tax
Appeals, Charles D. Hamel, and by legal commentators.
35 The ground for the decision may have been that the District
Court had no jurisdiction because the taxpayer was contesting the
legality of the balance of the assessment before the Board of Tax
Appeals.
38 In welcoming the members of the Board of Tax Appeals on
July 16, 1924, Under Secretary Winston described the difficulties
which had arisen in the past.
"... Under the law a tax once assessed had to be paid by the
taxpayer and then his remedy was to sue for its recovery. He must
first find tAe cash for a liability for which he may not have provided. . . . The first interest of all of the people is, of course, that
the Government continue to function, and to do this it must have the
means of prompt collection of the necessary supplies to keep it going,
that is, taxes. The method was, therefore, the determination by the
Commissioner of the amount of tax due, its collection and suit to
recover. . . . [T]he tax as assessed bad to be paid and the taxpayer was left to his remedy in the courts. The payment of the
tax was often a great hardship on the taxpayer, meaning in general
that he had to raise the cash for an unexpected liability which might
not be lawfully due." Treas. Dept. Press Release, July 16, 1924.

Seventeenth Annual Conference of the National Tax Association in

In commenting upon the Board of Tax Appeals legislation, which
contemplated leaving the taxpayer to his District Court remedy if
the decision of the Board was adverse, Secretary of the Treasury

There is strong circumstantial evidence that this view
of the jurisdiction of the courts was shared by the bar at
least until.1940, when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the Government's position in Coates v. United
States, 111 F. 2d 609. Out of the many thousands of
refund cases litigated in the pre-1940 period-the Governof the National Tax Association on Taxation which contained the
following remark: "Prior to the enactment of the Act of 1924 . . .
[i]f the decision on the appeal [to the Commissioner] was in favor
of. the government, the taxpayer, only after payment of the tax,
had the right to protest the correctness of the decision in the
courts . . . ." Proceedings 277-278.
One of the clearest statements of the rule by a commentator is to
be found in Bickford, Court Procedure in Federal Tax Cases (Rev.
ed. 1929) 3, 7-8, 9, 119.
"There are, however, certain other conditions which must be complied with before a suit is maintainable under this section. Briefly
stated, these are as follows:
"1. The tax must have been paid.
"2. After payment, the taxpayer must have filed with the Commissioner . . . a sufficient claim for the refund of the taxes sued for.
"The first requirement is obvious. We have, in the preceding
portions of this volume, found that a proceeding commenced in the
Board of Tax Appeals is the only exception to the rule that no
review by the courts is permissible at common law or under the
statutes, until the tax has been paid and 'the Government assured
of its revenue." Id., at 119.

such suits in the past 40 years-exhaustive research has
uncovered only nine suits in which the issue was-present,
in six of which the Government contested jurisdiction on
part-payment grounds.37 The Government's failure to

32 N. Y. U. L. Rev. (1957), 751, 777-778 ("It is generally said that

" Petitioner cites a number of cases in support of his argument
that neither the bar nor the Government has ever assumed that full
payment of the tax is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit for recovery.
The following factors rob these cases of the significance attributed
to them by the petitioner:
(a) A number of them, although cited-by petitioner in his petition
for rehearing, were later conceded by him, after his examination of
government files, not to be in point.
(b) A number of the cited cases involved excise taxes. The Government suggests-and we agree-that excise tax deficiencies may be
divisible into a tax on each transaction or event, and therefore
present an entirely different problem with respect to the full-payment
rule.
(c) The cases arising after 1940 are insignificant; Once the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled against the Government in Coates.
taxpayers would naturally be much more inclined to sue before full
payment, and the Government might well decide not to raise the
objection in a particular case for reasons relating to litigation strategy.
(d) In some of the cases the only amount remaining unpaid at the
time of suit was interest. As we have indicated, the statute lends
itself to a construction which would permit suit for the tax after full
payment thereof without payment of any part of the interest.
(e) In some of the cases the Government was not legally entitled
to collect the unpaid tax at the time of suit, either because the tax

system at the time permitted installment payment (see note 34,
supra), because the unpaid portion had not yet been assessed, or for
some other reason. Although the statute may not support any
distinction based on facts of this nature, it is quite understandable
that a taxpayer might have predicated a suit upon the theory that
the distinction was meaningful and that the Government might not
have contested it, whether because it agreed or for tactical reasons.
In the light of these considerations, we regard the following pre1941 cases as immaterial: Baldwin v. Higgins, 100 F. 2d 405 (C. A.

Four pre-1941 cases remain. Of these, only two are clearly cases
in which the jurisdictional issue was present and not raised by the
Government. Tsivoglou v. 'United States, 31 F. 2d 706 (C. A. 1st
Cir. 1929); Thomas v. United States, 85 Ct. Cl. 313, 18 F. Supp. 942
(1937). McFadden v. United States, 20 F. Supp. 625 (D. C. E. D.
Pa. 1937), is in the "doubtful" category. There the Commissioner
had granted the'taxpayer an extension of time for payment of 80% of
his assessment and the suit was for the remaining 0%, which had
been paid. The relevant facts of the last case, Peerless Paper Box
Mfg. Co. v. Routzahn, 22 F. 2d 459 (D. C. N. D. Ohio 1927), are so
unclear that the case meang nothing. The Government had applied
an admitted 1918 overpayment to a 1917 deficiency, but the deficiency was greater than the overpayment. The taxpayer sued to
recover this overpayment, and whether there had been full payment
at the time of suit depends upon whether the suit is regarded as one
for refund of 1917 or 1918 taxes.

Footnote 37-Continued.
Nor can we agree entirely with petitioner's evaluation of a second
group of pre-1941 cases-those in which the issue allegedly was present and the Government did raise it but lost. Five of these cases
involved primarily the troublesome concurrent jurisdiction problem
that arose before passage of § 7422 (e) of the 1954 Code when a
taxpayer both appealed to the Tax Court and brought suit in a Federal District Court. Brampton Woolen Co. v. Field, 55 F. 2d 325
(D. C. N. H. 1931), rev'd, 56 F. 2d 23 (C. A. 1st Cir. 1932), cert.
denied, 287 U. S. 608; Camp v. United States, 44 F. 2d 126 (C. A. 4th
Cir. 1930); Emery v. United States, 27 F. 2d 992 (D. C. W. D.
Pa. 1928); Old Colony R. Co. v. United States, 27 F. 2d 994 (D. C.
Mass. 1928); Ohio Steel Foundry Co. v. United States, 69 Ct. Cl.
158, 38 F. 2d 144 (1930). In all of-these cases except Camp, it appears
that the Government did raise the part-payment question. It is
true that the contention did not prevail, but this is not very
meaningful. In the first place, this question was quite subordinate
to the major issue, concurrent jurisdiction. In the second place,
the Government won in Brampton on another jurisdictional ground.
And finally, in contrast to Flora, in both Camp and Ohio Steel
Foundry the full assessment had been paid at the time suit was
.brought; it was only later that an additional deficiency was asserted
by the Commissioner.
To these cases should be added Riverside Hospital v. Larson, 38-4
CCH Fed. Tax Serv. 9542 (D. C. S. D. Fla. 1938), where the
Government raised the full-payment question and won, and Suhr v.
United States, 14 F. 2d 227 (D: C. W. D. Pa. 1926), aff'd, 18 F. 2d
81 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1927), another concurrent jurisdiction case where
the Government raised the issue and won, although the grounds for
the decision are not entirely clear.
This, then, is how we see the pre-1941 situation: Of 14 cases originally cited as being cases in which the jurisdictional issue was present
but not raised by the Government, five have been conceded by petitioner not to be in point; six, and possibly seven, are distinguisliable
for various reasons; and only two, or possibly three, remain. Of five
cases cited as being cases in which the jurisdictional issue was raised
by the. Government, only one, Coates v. United States, 111 F. 2d 609
(C. A. 2d Cir. 1940), or at most three, really involved the Flora
question. When to these are added Riverside, where the Government won, Suhr, where it may have won,_and Brampton Woolen Co.,
where it won in the Court of Appeals on another jurisdictional
ground, the box score is as follows: two or three cases in which the

Government failed to raise the issue; one, or possibly three, cases
in which the Government argued the question and lost; one case
in which it argued the question and won; one case in which it argued
the question and may have won; and one case in which it raised
the issue and prevailed on another jurisdictional defense-a total
of nine cases at most in which the issue was presented, out of which
the Government contested jurisdiction in six. Of course, this calculation may not be precise; but, in view of the many thousands of
tax refund suits which have been brought during the decades in
question, it is an accurate enough approximation to reflect a general
understanding of the jurisdictional significance of "pay first, litigate
later."
It would be bootless to consider each of the post-1940 cases cited.
by petitioner or to list the multitude of cases cited by the Government in which the jurisdictional issue has been raised. As we have
stated, we believe these cases have no significance whatsoever. However, perhaps it is worth noting that all but a handful of the cases
which petitioner, in the petition for rehearing, asserted to be ones
in.which the Government failed to raise the jurisdictional issue
would be immaterial even if they were pre-Coates. Thus, for example, petitioner has conceded error with respect to three cases.
Dickstein v. McDonald, 149 F. Supp. 580 (D. C. M. D. Pa. 1957),
aff'd, 255 F. 2d 640 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1958); O'Connor v United
States, 76 F. Supp. 962 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1948); Terrell v. United
States, 64 F. Supp. 418 (D. C. E. D. La. 1946). A number of
the cases involved excise taxes. E. g., Griffiths Dairy v. Squire,
138 F. 2d 758 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1943); Auricchio v. United States
49 F. Supp. 184 (D. C. E. D. N. Y. 1943). In some of the cases
only interest remained unpaid. Raymond v: United States, 58-1
U. S. T. C. 9397 (D. C. E. D. Mich. 1958) ; Hogg v. Allen, 105 F.
Supp. 12 (D. C. M. D. Ga. 1952). And some of the cases arose in the
Third Circuit after a decision adverse to the Government in Sirian
Lamp Co. v. Manning, 123 F. 2d 776 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1941). Gallagher
v. Smith, 223 F. 2d 218 (1955); Peters v. Smith, 123 F. Supp. 711
(D. C. E. D. Pa. 1954), rev'd, 221 F. 2d 721 (1955). It might be
noted also that Jones v. Fox, 162 F. Supp. 449 (D. C. Md. 1957),
cited as a case in which the Government argued the jurisdictional
question and lost, was an excise tax case in which the court disti'guished our prior decision in Flora because of the divisibility of the
excise tax. Another such decision during the pre-1941 period was
Friebele v. United States. 20 F. Supp. 492 (D. C. N. J. 1937).

Opinion of the Court.

raise the issue in the other three is obviously entirely without significance. Considerations of litigation strategy
may have been thought to militate against resting upon
such a defens'e in those cases. Moreover, where only nine
lawsuits involving a particular issue arise over a period
of many decades,: the policy of the Executive Department
on that issue can-hardly be expected to become familiar to
every government attorney. But most important, the
number of cases before 1940 in which the issue was present
is simply so inconsequential that it reinforces the conclusion of the prior opinion with respect to the uniformity of
the pre-1940 belief that full payment had to precede suit.
A word should also be said about the argument that
requiring taxpayers to pay the full assessments before
bringing suits will subject some of them to great hardship.
This contention seems to ignore entirely the right of the
taxpayer to appeal the deficiency to the Tax Court without paying a cent."8 If he permits his time for filing such
an appeal to expire, he can hardly complain that he has
been unjustly treated, for he is in precisely the same position as any other person who is barred by a statute of
limitations. On the other hand, the Government has a
substantial interest in protecting the public purse, an
interest which would be substantially impaired if a taxpayer could sue in a District Court without paying his tax
in full. It is instructive to note that, as of June 30, 1959,
tax cases pending in the Tax Court involved $920,046,748,
and refund suits in other courts involved $446,673,640.11
38

Petitioner points out that the Tax Court has no jurisdiction

over excise tax cases. See 9 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (Zimet Rev. 1958), § 50.08. But this fact provides no policy
support for his position, since, as we have noted, excise tax assessments may be divisible into a tax on each transaction or event, so
that the full-payment rule would probably require no more than
payment of a small amount. See note 37, supra.
39 Of this $446,673,640, District Court suits involved $222,177,920;
Court of Claims suits, $220,247,436; and state court suits, $4,248,284.

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.
Opinion of the Court.

362 U. S.

It is quite true that the filing of an appeal to the Tax Court
normally precludes the Government from requiring payment of the tax,4" but a decision in petitioner's favor could
be expected to throw a great portion of the Tax Court litigation into the District Courts.' Of course, the Government can collect the tax from a District Court suitor by
exercising its power of distraint-if he does not split his
cause of action-but we cannot believe that compelling
resort to this extraordinary procedure is either wise or in
accord With congressional intent. Our system of taxation
is based upon voluntary assessment and payment, not
upon distraint.2 A full-payment requirement will promote the smooth functioning of this system; a partpayment rule would work at cross-purposes with it."3
In sum, if we were to accept petitioner's argument, we
would sacrifice the harmony of our carefully structured
twentieth century system of tax litigation, and all that
See note 22, supra.
practical effects which might result from acceptance of
petitioner's argument are sketched in Lowitz, Federal Tax Refund
Suits and Partial Payments, 9 The Decalogue J. 9, 10:
"Permi*tting refund suits after partial payment of the tax assessment
would benefit many taxpayers. Such a law would be open to wide
abuse and would probably seriously impair the government's ability
to collect taxes. Many taxpayers, without legitimate grounds for
contesting an assessment, would make a token payment and sue for
refund, hoping at least to reduce the amount they would ultimately
have to pay. In jurisdictions where the District Court is considered
to be a 'taxpayer's court' most taxpayers would use that forum
instead of the Tax Court. Conceivably such legislation could cause
the chaotic tax collection situations which exist in some European
countries, since there would be strong impetus to a policy of paying
a little and trying to settle the balance."

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.

I should like to append a word to my Brother WHITopinion, with which I entirely agree.
While Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489, is no
longer law, the opinion of the much lamented Mr. Justice
Jackson, based as it was on his great. experience in tax
litigation, has not lost its force insofar as it laid bare the
complexities and perplexities for judicial construction of
tax legislation. For one not a specialist in this field to
examine every tax question that comes before the Court
independently would involve in most cases an inquiry
into the course of tax legislation and litigation far beyond
the facts of the immediate case. Such an inquiry entails
weeks of study and reflection. Therefore, in construing
a tax law it has been my rule to follow almost blindly
accepted understanding of the meaning of tax legislation,
when that is manifested by long-continued, uniform

able to do this without extraordinary and costly effort and in some
cases it may not be able to do it at all.
"3. The use of the drastic-collection remedies would often cause
inconvenience and perhaps hardship to the, creditors, debtors,

practice, unless a statute leaves no admissible opening for
administrative construction.
Therefore, when'advised in connection with the disposition of this case after its first argument that "there
does not appear to be a single cae before 1940 in which
a taxpayer attempted a suit for refund of income taxes
without paying the full amount the Government alleged
to be due," (357 U. S. 63, at 69), I deemed such a longcontinued, unbroken practical construction of the statute
controlling as to the meaning of the Revenue Act of 1921,
now 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a)(1). Once the basis which for
me governed the disposition of the case was no longer
available, I was thrown back to an independent inquiry
of the course of tax legislation and litigation for more
than a hundred years, for all of that was relevant to a
true understanding of the problem presented by this case.
This involved many weeks of study during what is called
the summer vacation. Such a study led to the conclusion set forth in detail in the opinion of my Brother
WEITTAKER.

MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE
FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE

STEWART join, dissenting.

A deep and abiding conviction that the Court today
departs from the plain direction of Congress expressed in
28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a), defeats its beneficent purpose, and
repudiates many soundly reasoned opinions of the federal
courts on the question presented, compels me to express
and explain my disagreement in- detail.
In his income tax return for the year 1950, petitioner
deducted in full, as ordinary in character, the losses he
had suffered in commodity transactions in that year,
but the Commissioner viewed those losses as capital in

character and proposed, by his 90-day letter, the assessment of a deficiency in the amount of $27,251.13, plus
interest. Petitioiier did not petition the Tax Court for a
redetermination of the proposed deficiency and the Commissioner -assessed it on March 27, 1953. In April and
June 1953, petitioner paid to the Commissioner a total
of $5,058.54 upon the assessment and timely thereafter
filed a claim for refund of that sum. The claim was
rejected on July 13, 1955, and, on August 3, 1956, petitioner brought this action against the United States in
the District Court for Wyoming to recover the amount
paid, alleging, inter alia, that said sum "has been illegally
and unlawfully collected" from him, and he prayed
judgment therefor with interest from the date of payment.
At the trial, the Government prevailed on the merits,
142 F. Supp. 602, but the Court of Appeals, without reaching the merits, remanded with directions to dismiss, holding that because the petitioner had not paid the entire
amount of the assessment the District Court had no jurisdiction of the action. 246 F. 2d 929. We granted, certiorari and, after hearing, affirmed the judgment of the
Court of Appeals. 357 U. S. 63. On June 22, 1959, we
granted a petition for rehearing and restored the case to
the docket. 360 U. S. 922. It has since been rebriefed,
reargued and again submitted.
The case is now presented in a very different posture
than before, as certain vital contentions that were previously made are now conceded to have been erroneous.
The question presented is whether a Federal District
Court has jurisdiction of an action by a taxpayer against
the United States to recover payments made to the
Commissioner upon, but which discharged less thai the
entire amount of, an illegal assessment.
The answer to that question depends upon whether the
United States has waived its sovereign immunity to, and

OCTOBER .TERM, 1959.

has consented to, such a suit in a District Court. The
applicable jurisdictional statute is 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a).
Itprovides:
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction,
concurrent with the Court of Claims, of:
"(1) -Any civil action against the United States
for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged
to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected,
without authority or any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under
the internal-revenue laws." (Emphasis added.)
In its former .opinion the Court recognized that the
words of the statute might "be termed a clear authorization to sue for the refund of 'any sum,'" 357 U. S., at 65,
but it concluded that Congress had left room in the statute
for an implication that the waiver of immunity and grant
of jurisdiction applied only to refund suits in which the
entire amounts of assessments had been paid. Advocating the existence of that implication, the Government
contended and urged that, from the time of the decision
in Cheatham v. United States, 92 U. S. 85, in 1875 until
the decision in Coates v. United States, 111 F. 2d 609
(C. A. 2d Cir.), in 1940, there was an unquestioned understanding and uniform practice that full payment of an
assessment was a condition upon the right to sue for
refund; and, finding what it then accepted as adequate
support for that contention, the Court was persuaded that,
since no subsequent statute had purported to change it,
such unquestioned understanding so long and uniformly
applied was still effective.
Support -for that asserted unquestioned understanding and uniform practice was principally derived from two
sources. First, statements in Cheatham v. United States,
'supra, were thought to have enunciated a full-payment

doctrine 1 which seemed never to have been directly questioned. Second, the contention was accepted that "there
does not appear to be a single case before 1940 in which a
taxpayer attempted a suit for refund of.income taxes
without paying the full amount the Government alleged
to be due." 357 U. S., at 69.
The Government now concedes that the second contention was erroneous. There were, for example, two cases
in this Court (Cook v. Tait, 265 U. S. 47 (1924); Bowers
v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., 271 U. S. 170 (1926))

in which

taxpayers had sued for refunds after having paid only
1The language of Cheatham relied upon by this Court in its first
opinion was the following:
"So also, in the internal-revenue department, the statute'which
we have copied allows appeals from the assessor to the commissioner
of internal revenue; and, if dissatisfied with his decision, on paying
the tax the party can sue the collector; and, if the money was
wrongfully exacted, the courts will give him relief by a judgment,
which the United States pledges herself to pay.
"While a free course of remonstrance and appeal is allowed
within the departments before the money is finilly exacted, the
general government has wisely made the payment of the tax
claimed, whether of customs oi of internal revenue, a condition precedent to a resort to the courts by the party against whom the tax is
assessed. . . . If the compliance wi,.h this condition [that suit must
be brought within six months of the Commissioner's decision] requires
the party aggrieved to pay the money, he must do it. He cannot,
after the decision is rendered against him, protract the time within
which he can cc -itest that decision in the courts by his own delay in
paying the money. It is essential to the honor and orderly conduct of
the government that its taxes should be promptly paid, and drawbacks speedily adjusted; and the rule prescribed in this class of cases
is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. ...
"The c, jecting party can take his appeal. He can, if the decision
is delayed beyond twelve months, rest his case on that decision; or
he can pay the amount claimed, and commence his suit at any time
within that period. So, after the decision, he can pay at once, and
commence suit within the six months . . . ...92 U. S., at 88-89.

portions (in one case $298.34 of an assessment of $1,193.38,
in the other $5,198.77 of an assessment of $10,320.14) of
the amounts assessed against them. It was not contended
by the Government in either of those cases that there was
any want of jurisdiction, and this Court considered and
decided both upon the merits.2 Petitioner has now cited
many other tax refund cases, decided in the lower courts
prior to 1940, in which taxpayers had paid, and sued to
recover, less than the whole of assessments alleged to have
been illegal, and in which cases the Government did not
question jurisdiction. The Government concedes that in
2

The Government now seeks to distinguish these two cases because

they arose under the Revenue Act of 1921, Act of Nov. 23, 1921,
c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, and because § 250 (a) of which permitted the tax-

payer, at his option, to pay the tax in four trimonthly installments,
rather than all at once. The taxpayers in both Cook v. Tait and
Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co. did choose to pay in installments,
and the Government points to the fact that, at the time the suits were
brought, all installments due had been paid, although the full assessment had not. The Government therefore w6uld seem to take the
position that the whole tax need not be paid, so long as the taxpayer,
when he initiates the suit, has paid "all that the taxpayer was at that
time legally obligated to pay, and all (in the absence of a so-called
jeopardy assessment) that the Commissioner was at that time .legally
empowered to collect." (It should be pointed out that in Cook v.
Tait and Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co. installments fell due immediately after suit was begun, and before hearing or adjudication;
these installments were not paid as they came due.) It seems almost
unnecessary to say that the words of the jurisdictional statute simply
will not support this "fine distinction urged by the Government; nor
is there the least support for it (there is, if anything, contradiction)
in the material the Government cites to establish an understanding
of the full-payment requirement.
The lower courts' decisions cited by petitioner, that were rendered
prior to 1940, in which taxpayers had paid, and sued to recover, less
than the whole of assessments alleged to have been illegal, and in
which the Government did not question jurisdiction, are: Tsivoglou v.

In justice to counsel for both parties it seems appropriate to
observe-what every lawyer knows-that cases, such as these, in
which there "lurked in the record" questions that were not raised or
decided are- not discoverable by any ordinary means of reference.
Without doubt, this fact accounts for the failure of counsel to take
account of or to cite, and of this Court to find, those cases on the
first hearing.
Petitioner has cited a number of oth'er cases, decided by the lower
courts prior to and during 1940, that sought recovery of partial
payments upon assessments, and in each of which the Government
did challenge, but unsuccessfully, the jurisdiction of the courts,
namely, Coates v. United States, 111 F. 2d 609 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1940) ;
Camp v. United States, 44 F. 2d 126 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1930); Ohio

jurisdictional provision here in issue, which is applicable only to suits

No one has suggested that the jurisdictional requirement of the
amount of the assessed tax that must be paid as a prerequisite to a
suit for refund is different when the suit is against the Collector,
with regard to which suits there is no specific jurisdictional provision, rather than against the United States.

a conclusion that there ever was an unquestioned understanding and uniform practice that full payment of an
assessed deficiency was a condition upon the jurisdiction
of a District Court to entertain a suit for refund.
In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that nothing in
Cheatham v. United States, supra, fairly may be said to
hold that full payment of an illegally assessed deficiency
is a condition upon the jurisdiction of a District Court to
entertain a suit for refund. No such issue was involved
in that case. There the assessment had been fully paid,
and the only issue was whether a proper claim for refund
was a condition precedent to the maintenance of a suit to
recover the amount alleged to have been illegally collected. Not only were the statements there made respecting "payment of the- tax" pure dictum, but even the
language there used did not embrace, and certainly was
not directed to, the question whether full payment of an
assessment is a condition upon the jurisdiction of a
District Court to entertain a suit for refund.
I pass, then, to an examination of the history of
the present jurisdictional provision, § 1346. (a), and the
scheme of the present tax' law to determine whether there
is any real support for the Government's contention that
a proper reading of the language of § 1346 (a) requires
an implied qualification to its obvious self-explanatory
meaning, so that full payment -of an assessment,. alleged
to have been illegal, is made a condition upon the jurisdiction of a District Court to entertain a suit for refund.
"Judicial proceedings for refund of United States taxes
in federal courts originated, without express statutory
authority, by suits against Collectors (now District
Directors), before the United States had made itself
amenable to suit. Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137

against a Collector of Customs for refund of duties

illegally assessed and-paid under protest.' The doctrine
of the action, based upon the commo.i-law count of
assumpsit for money had and received, was thus formulated: "[W] here money is illegally demanded a id received
by an agent, he cannot exonerate himself from personal
responsibility by paying it over to his principal; if he has
had notice not to pay it over." 10 Pet., at 158. As a
result of that case, Collectors of Customs who collected
monies, paid under protest, resorted to the practice of
withholding such amounts from the Government as indemnity against loss should a refund suit against them be
successful. See Plumb, Tax Refund Suits Against Collectors of Internal Revenue, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 685, 688-689.
That practice led to abuses and facilitated peculation
under the guise of self-protection. Because of the Wholesale frauds of Swartwout, the New York Collector (see
Swartwout, 18 Dictionary of American Biography (1936),
238-239), Congress, in 1839, expressly prohibited such
withholdings by Customs Collectors pending the possibility, or the result, of litigation against them. Act
of Mar. 3, 1839, c. 82, § 2, 5 Stat. 348. Six years later,
in 1845, this Court held that this Act, by reducing the
Collector to "the mere bearer of those sums [du ies] to the
Treasury," terminated the right of action against the Collector for refund, for, being deprived o, the right to withhold payment to his principal, he was no longer un'der an
implied promise to refund illegally collected duties to the
taxpayer. Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, 241 (1845).
This created the intolerable condition of denying to
taxpayers any remedy whatever in the District Courts
to recover amounts illegally assessed and collected, anddoubtless also influenced by the vigorous dissents of Mr.

Justice Story and Mr. Justice McLean in that caseinduced Congress to pass the Act of Feb. 26, 1845, c. 22,
5 Stat. 727,' which was the first statute expressly giving
taxpayers the right to sue for refund of taxes illegally
collected. That'Act, in substance, provided that nothing
contained in the Act of Mar. 3, 1839 (c. 82, § 2, 5 Stat.
348), should be construed to take away or impair the right
of any person who had paid duties under protest to any
Collector of Customs, which were not lawfully "payable
in part or in whole," to maintain an action at law against
the Collector to recover such amounts. It is evident that
Congress, by that statute, was merely concerned to reverse
the consequences of Cary v. Curtis, supra, and to restore
the right of action against Collectors which had originally
been sustained in Elliot't v. Swartwout, supra. Neither the
terms of that statute nor such knowledge* as is available
of its history' reveals any limiting purpose except that

While that statute, the Act of Feb. 26, 1845, referred
only to refunds of customs duties, this Court held in City
of Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 720, 730-733
(1866), that taxpayers had the same right of action
against Collectors to recover illegally collected internal
revenue taxes.8
The United States was first made directly suable in
District Courts for tax refunds by the Act of Mar. 3, 1887,
c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, commonly known as the Tucker Act,
which conferred jurisdiction on the District Courts over
"All claims [against the United States, not exceeding
$1,000] founded upon the Constitution of the United
States or any law of Congress, . . . or upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the Government of the
United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated,
in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims
the party would be entitled to redress against the United
States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if
the United States were suable." This jurisdictional grant
The Court recognized that internal revenue collectors, like
customs collectors, were required to pay daily into the Treasury all sums collected under the internal revenue laws. Act of Mar.
3, 1865, c. 78, § 3, 13 Stat. 483. In refusing to reach the same result
as had been reached in Cary v. Curtis, without an express saving
statute such as the Act of Feb. 26, 1845, the Court relied upon the
provisions in the internal revenue laws that the Commissioner shall
pay all judgments for refunds recovered against Collectors. Act of
Mar. 3, 1863, c. 74, § 31, 12 Stat. 729; Act of June 30, 1864, c. 173,
§ 44, 13 Stat. 239; Act of July 13, 1866, c. 184, § 9, 14 Stat. 101, 111.
"Clear implication of the several provisions is, that a judgment
against the collector in such a case [a refund suit] is in the nature
of a recovery against the United States, and that the amount recovered is regarded as a proper charge against the revenue collected
from that source." City of Philadelphiav. The Collector. 5 Wall., at

was held, in United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty
Co., 237 U. S. 28 (1915), to have included jurisdiction
over suits for tax refunds, as claims "founded upon" the
internal revenue laws. The general language of that Act,
the Tucker Act, was most evidently not intended to, and
did not, impose any new conditions upon the pre-existing
right to sue (the Collector) for the refund of taxes illegally
collected, save for a monetary limit of $1,000, which was
increased to $10,000 in 1911.
The gist of § 1346 (a), 1" with which we are now concerned, first appeared in the jurisdictional statute in 1921,
as part of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, § 1310 (c), 42
Stat. 311. The reason for its appearance is entirely unrelated to the question whether full payment of an assessment is a condition precedent to a suit for refund. Under
the Tucker Act, as it stood in 1921, the -United States
could not be sued in a District Court for a tax refund of
more than $10,000. Taxpayers with larger claims could
pursue either their old remedy-which continued to be
available and is today-against the Collector in the District Courts or their remedy against the United States in
the Court of Claims. But, the right of suit against the
Collector was impaired in 1921 by the decision in Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., 257 U. S. 1 (1921). It held
that such actions against the Collector were personal in
character and not maintainable against his successor in
office. Hence, if the Collector had died or ceased to be

c. 648, § 1, 68 Stat. 589.
10 The gist of § 1346 (a) provides: "for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected without
authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner
wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws." 28 U. S. C.

inoffice, a taxpayer with a refund claim of more than
$1,000 had no remedy in a District Court.. The portion of the Revenue Act of 1921 that is now embodied in
§ 1346 (a) was an amendment of the Tucker Act and was
designed to preserve to taxpayers with claims of more
than $10,000 a District Court remedy, even where the
Collector had died or was out of office, by suit against
the United States. The legislative history makes this
purpose plain."
The relevant portion of the 1921 Amendment to the
Tucker Act-part of the Revenue Act of 1921 (c. 136,
§ 1310 (c), 42 Stat. 311) "-was apparently taken from a
provision in Revised Statutes § 3226 (1875) that "No
suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of
any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously
or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed
to have been collected without authority, or of any sum
alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until appeal shall have been duly made to
the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue." 3 In that
context it is clear that the language "any tax," "any penalty" or "any sum" had no reference to what payments
were required to precede a suit for refund. Quite evidently, its function was only to describe, in broadest terms,
11See 61 Cong. Rec. 7506-7507 (1921); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 486,

67th Cong., 1st Sess. 57 (1921).
12 See note 10.
13 This language was in turn preceded by § 19 of the Revenue

Act of July 13, 1866, c. 184, 14 Stat. 152, which did not include
any reference to "penalties" or "sums": "[N]o suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been
erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, until appeal shall have
been duly made to the commissioner of internal revenue ......
It
is important to note that this was the "claim for refund" statute
in effect at the time of, and that was applicable to, Cheatham v.
United States, supra. Quite unlike § 1346 (a), it made no reference
to "any sum."

the claims for refund which were required to be submitted
to the Commissioner before suit might be brought thereon.
What reasonable basis is there for ascribing to Congress,
by reason of its insertion of this language into the Tucker
Act, an intent to require full payment of an illegal assessment as a condition upon the jurisdiction of a District
Court to entertain a suit for refund? The change was a
jurisdictional one in a jurisdictional statute, and the
language, it is almost necessary to assume, was chosen
because, in another statute, it referred to all of the actions
which could be brought for refund of internal revenue
taxes.
The Government heavily relies on statements made in
Congress pertaining to the establishment in 1924 of the
Board of Tax Appeals (since 1942 designated the Tax
Court) and its reorganization in 1926. It asserts that
these statements demonstrate a congressional understanding that the broad language in § 1346 (a) excludes jurisdiction of District Courts to entertain suits to recover only
partial payments of assessments alleged to be illegal. It
is true that those statements, some of which are reproduced in the margin," are consistent with the Govern14"The committee [on Ways and Means] recommends the establishment of a Board of Tax Appeals to which a taxpayer may appeal
prior to the payment of an additional assessment of income, excessprofits, war-profits, or estate taxes. Although a taxpayer may, after
payment of his tax, bring suit for the recovery thereof and thus
secure a judicial determination on the questions involved, he can
not, in view of section 3224 of the Revised Statutes, which prohibits

suits to enjoin the collection of taxes, secure such a aetermination
prior to the payment of the tax. The right of appeal after payment
of the tax is an incomplete remedy, and does little to remove the
hardship occasioned by an incorrect assessment. The payment of a
large additional tax on income received several years previous and
which may have, since its receipt, been either wiped out by subsequent losses, invested in nonliquid assets, or spent, sometimes forces
taxpayers into bankruptcy, and often causes great financial hardship

ment's interpretation of that section. But, as with the
statements in Cheatham v. United States, supra, they are
not directed to the question we have, here and are too
imprecise for the drawing of such a far-reaching inference,
involving, as it does, the interpolation of a drastic qualiand sacrifice. These results are not remedied by permitting the
taxpayer to sue f'r the recovery of the tax after this payment. He
is entitled to an appeal and to a determination of his liability for
the tax prior to its payment." H. R. Rep. No. 179, 68th Cong.,
1st Sess. 7 (1924).
"Now, it is true that under the present law it is possible to get
a judicial review, but it is very slow and expensive. In order to get a
judicial review under the law as it exists to-day a man must pay
his tax and pay it under protest; then he must file a claim for refund;
then the Government has six months within which to accept or
reject it; then after that he must begin an action in the courts."
Remarks of Representative Young, 65 Cong. Rec. 2621 (1924).
"The practice, as I understand it,* has been to require the taxpayer to pay in the amount of the increased assessment, and then
to allow him to get it back if he can. In addition to this, distraints
frequently have been issued seizing the property of the citizen, so
that the man whose taxes may have been raised unjustly may find
himself forced to raise a large sum of money at once or have his
property seized." Remarks of Senator Reed of Missouri, 65 Cong.
Rec. 8109 (1924).
"One of the chief arguments presented in the reports of the committees of both Houses [upon the creation of the Board of Tax
Appeals] was to relieve the taxpayer of the hardship of being forced
to go out and pay his tax before he could have a judicial consideration of the problems involved in his case. The taxpayer who was
faced with, say, $100,000 of additional tax, and who was forced to
pay that mopey, very frequently had his credit destroyed, and sometimes he was forced into bankruptcy in order to meet that payment.
It was a real hardship. The man who had already paid the tax had
gone through the suffbring, had filed his claim for refund, and had
his remedy. He has the remedy that he had prior to the creation
of the board." Statement of Charles D. Hamel, first Chairman of
the Board of Tax Appeals, Hearings before the House Committee on

fication into the otherwise plain, clear and unlimited
provisions of the statute.
The Tax Court was created to alleviate hardships occasioned by the fact that the collection of assessments, however illegal, could not be enjoined. And the Government
argues that the hardships which motivated Congress to
establish the Tax Court would not have existed if a taxpayer could, as the petitioner did here, pay only part of
a deficiency assessment and then, by way of a suit for
refund, litigate the legality of the assessment in a District
Court. But that procedure would not then, nor today,
afford any sure relief to taxpayers from the hardships
which troubled Congress in 1924, for it is undisputed that
the institution of a suit for refund of a partial payment of
an assessment does not stay the Commissioner's power of
collection 5by distraint Or otherwise, and a taxpayer with
the property or means to pay the balance of the assessment cannot avoid its payment, except through the Commissioner's acquiescence and failure to exercise his power
of distraint."
The Government argues, with some force, that our tax
legislation as a whole contemplates the Tax Court as the
forum for adjudication of deficiencies, and the District
Courts and Court of Claims as the forums for adjudication of refund suits. This, in general, is true, and it is
also true that to hold that full payment of assessments
15 "Except as provided in sections 6212 (a) and (c), and 6213 (a)
[giving a right to petition the Tax Court], no suit for the purpose
of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court." Int. Rev. Code, 1954, § 7421. Such a provision has been in the law since the Act of Mar. 2, 1867, c. 169, § 10,
14 Stat. 475.
18 Indeed there does not seem to be any way of restraining the
Commissioner from collecting the remainder of a deficiency even
after the taxpayer who has paid part 'has won a suit for refund,
the Commissioner thus forcing the taxpayer to bring another action
for refund.

is not a condition upon the jurisdiction of District Courts
to entertain suits for refund is to sanction what may be
called a "hybrid" remedy in the District Courts, for the
suit of the taxpayer who has paid only part of an assessment and has sued for refund will, under application of
the principles of collateral estoppel, determine the legality
of the remainder of the deficiency as well as his right to
refund of the amount paid. But such dual determinations are possible under the present law 17 and it is difficult .to conceive how they ma create sufficient disharmony to justify such a strained interpretation of the plain
words of § 1346 (a) as the Government's contention
would require."
Nor is the argument sound that to hold that full payinent of an illegal assessment is not a condition upon the
jurisdiction of District Courts to entertain suits for refund
would unduly hamper the collection of taxes, by encouraging taxpayers to withhold payment of large portions of assessments while prosecuting litigation for the
refund of the part already paid. Not only is it true that
the institution of a suit for refund does not stay collection,1" but, since the creation of the Tax Court, any taxpayer has a method of withholding payment, immune
See §§ 7422 (e) and 6512 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954

tion over suits involving both deficiencies and claims for refund.
18 The Government suggests that if this Court permits the petitioner to maintain his action for refund it will, as a consequence,
sanction the practice of a taxpayer making only "token payment,"
and then, by a suit for refund, adjudicating the legality of the entire
assessment. We are not here concerned with such a totally different
question.' Petitioner's, payment of $5,058.54 on ;n assessment of
$27,251.13 certainly was not a "token payment"; nor could the suit
to recover the amount paid be said to be one for a declaratory judgment-not permitted "with respect to Federal taxes"-under 28

from distraint,"° until the legality of the assessment is
finally determined. Any delay in collection which might
be caused by holding that full payment of an assessment is
not a condition upon the jurisdiction of a District Court
to entertain a suit for refund would be of the same order
'as the delay incident to adjudication by the Tax Court,
and would not create so incongruous a result as to justify
giving an otherwise clear and unlimited statute a strained
and unnatural meaning.
Petitioner, on the other hand, suggests that if it be held
that full payment of illegal assessments is a condition
upon the jurisdiction of District Courts in refund suits,
not only will the words of § 1346 (a) be disregarded,
but great hardships upon taxpayers will result, and that
such an intention should not lightly be implied. Where,
a taxpayer has paid, upon a normal or a "jeopardy" assessment, either voluntarily or under compulsion of distraint,
a part only of an illegal assessment and is unable to pay
the balance within the two-year period of limitations,2 1 he
would be deprived of any means of establishing the
invalidity of the assessment and of recovering the amount
illegally collected from him, unless it be held, as it seems
to me Congress plainly provided in § 1346 (a), that full
payment is not a condition upon the jurisdiction of District Courts to entertain suits for refund. 2 Likewise, tax20 Except for the provision made for a "jeopardy assessment."

payers who pay assessments in installments would be
without remedy to recover early installments that were
wrongfully collected should the period of limitations run
before the last installment is paid.
No one has suggested that Congress could not constitutionally confer jurisdiction upon District Courts to entertain suits against the United States to recover sums
ing without funds to employ counsel to prepare, file in Washington,
and prosecute a petition for redetermination in the Tax Court, none
was filed by either of the taxpayers, and the Commissioner made the
assessments as proposed. One year later, their father died intestate,
and thereupon the family homestead vested equally in his two sons
(the taxpayers) under the State's laws of descent. The tax liens.
were, of course, instantly impressed upon their respective interests,
and, under warrants of distraint, the Commissioner sold the homestead. It brought a total of $8,500 ($4,250 for the interest of each
of the taxpayers). This, of course, satisfied the assessment and
accrued interest against the minor partner, but left unpaid about
$2,000 of the assessment and accrued interest against the major
partner. Both filed claims for refund, which were denied. The
taxpayers then filed separate suits, presenting identical issues, in the
same Federal District Court to recover the taxes and interest thus
collected by the Commissioner. The cases were consolidated for trial.
The Court found that the assessments were illegal and the taxes
wrongfully collected. The proceeds of the sale of the minor taxpayer's interest being sufficient to discharge the illegal assessment
and accrued interest against him, the court rendered judgment in his
favor for the sum thus wrongfully collected. But, inasmuch as the
proceeds of the sale were not sufficient to discharge the illegal assessment against the major partner, and he was financially unable to pay
the balance of it, the Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to allow
his recovery of the $4,250 thus found to have been wrongfully
collected from him under the internal revenue laws. Is this fair?
Is it not shocking? More to the point, is not that result plainly
proscribed by Congess' words in § 1346 (a) that: "The district
courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . of . . . Any civil action
against the United States for the recovery of . . . any sum alleged
to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under
the internal-revenue laws"? (Emphasis added.)

wrongfully collected- under, but which did not discharge
the whole of, illegal assessments. Nor can it be denied
that Congress has provided in § 1346 (a) that:
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . of . . Any civil action against the United
States for the recovery of . . . any sum alleged to
have been excessiv or in any manner wrongfully
collected under the ivternal-revenue laws." (Emphasis added.)
English words more clearly expressive of the grant of
jurisdiction to Federal District Courts over such cases
than those used by Congress do not readily occur to me.
It must, therefore, be concluded that there is no sound
reason for implying into § 1346 (a) a limitation that full
payment of an illegal assessment is a condition upon the
jurisdiction of a District Court to entertain a suit for
refund. Inasmuch as no contradiction or absurdity is
created' by so doing, I think it is our duty to rely upon
the words of § 1346 (a) rather than upon unarticulated
implications or exceptions. Particularly is this so in dealing with legislation in an area such as internal revenue,
where countless rules and exceptions are the subjects of
frequent revisions and precise refinements.
By § 1346 (a) Congress expressed its purpose to waive
sovereign immunity to suits, and to grant jurisdiction to
District Courts over suits, to recover "any sum alleged
to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws." Surely these
words do not limit the waiver of immunity or the grant
of jurisdiction to actions in which the entire amounts of
illegal assessments have been paid. Even if the words
''any internal-revenue tax" or "any penalty," when read
in isolation and most restrictively, could be thought to
contemplate only the entire amount of an illegal assess-

ment, the concluding phrase-"or any sum alleged to
have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected"-leaves no room or basis for any such construction
of the statute as a whole. Judged by its text and its
history in relation to other provisions of the tax laws,
as must be done, I cannot doubt that Congress plainly
expressed its intention to waive sovereign immunity to
suits, and to grant jurisdiction to District Courts over
suits, against the United States to recover "any sum"
alleged to have been wrongfully collected. Petitioner's
complaint here alleged that the $5,058.54 which he had
paid&to the Commissioner upon the questioned assessment
"has been illegally and unlawfully collected" from him.
The complaint, therefore, stated a cause of action within
the jurisdiction of the District Court.
But the Court does not so see it. The majority now
hold, despite the statute, that full payment of an
illegal assessment is a condition upon the jurisdiction of
a District Court to entertain a suit for refund. It, therefore, seems appropriate, in order eventually to avoid the
harsh injustice of permitting the Government unlawfully
to collect and retain taxes that are not owing, to express
the hope that Congress will try again.
