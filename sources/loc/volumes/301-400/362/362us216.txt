OCTOBER TERM, 1)59.
Per Curiam.

362 U. S.

WILLIS v. UNITED STATES.
ON

PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.

No. 546, Misc.

Decided March 21, 1960.

Certiorari granted; judgment vacated; and case remanded.

Petitioner pro se.
Solicitor General Rankin for the United States.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted. Upon the suggestion of the Solicitor General
that the case be remanded to the Court of Appeals in
light of what we are informed is the present practice of
that court "to appoint an attorney in all cases on direct
appeal where the trial judge's certificate of bad faith is
attacked" the petition for writ of certiorari is granted.
The judgment of the Court of Appals for the District of
Columbia Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded
to that court for further proceedings.
