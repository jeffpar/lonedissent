DECISIONS PER CURIAM.
362 U.S.

April 18, 1960.

In view of the doubts and ambiguities regarding the
legal significance of the psychiatric testimony in this case
and the resulting difficulties of retrospectively determining
the petitioner's competency as of more than a year ago,
we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming
the judgment of conviction, and remand the case to the
District Court for a new hearing to ascertain petitioner's
present competency to stand trial, and for a new trial if
petitioner is found competent.
It is so ordered.

IZZO v. ILLINOIS.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 772, Misc. Decided April 18, 1960.
Appeal dismissed and certiorari denied.
PER CURIAM.

The appeal is dismissed. Treating the papers whereon
the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari,
certiorari is denied.
