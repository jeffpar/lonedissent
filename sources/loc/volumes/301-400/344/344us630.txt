No. 499.

PER CURI.AM.

In this proceeding, the Government sought the forfeiture of an automobile and of a truck under the provisions
of ยง 3116 of the Internal Revenue Code in the District
Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. That Section allows the seizure and forfeiture of property '"intended
for use in violating" the alcohol tax laws, as well as property "which has been so used.", The respondent, alleging
an interest in the two vehicles, contested the forfeitures.
The district judge found the facts to be that the truck
and automobile had each been used by the operator of an
illegal distillery to drive a number of miles from his home
and then parked at a point one-half mile or more from the
distillery, the operator walking the rest of the way, The
district judge found that the Government had not shown,
as it had alleged, that the vehicles had been used for transporting materials or utensils for use at the distillery,
and ruled that the facts shown did not.justify a forfeiture. The Cour.t of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
affirmed, 199 F. 2d 495.

UNITED STATES v. LANE MOTOR CO.
630

631

Opinion of the Court.

The Government has petitioned for a writ of certiorari
showing that, while the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in United States v. One 1948 Plymouth Sedan,
198 F. 2d 399 (1952), held in accord with the Tenth Circuit, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has taken
a contrary view, United States v. One 1950'FordHalf-Ton
Pickup Automobile Truck, 195 F. 2d 857 (1952). Certiorari is granted in order to resolve this conflict.
We think it clear that a vehicle used solely for commuting to an illegal distillery is not used in violating the
revenue laws.
Certiorari granted, and the judgment affirmed.
