OCTOBER TERM, 1952.
Opinion of the Court

344 U. S.

CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD ET AL. v. AMERICAN
AIR TRANSPORT, INC. ET AL.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT.

No. 126.

Certificate dismissed October 20, 1952.

A certificate of the Court of Appeals certifying to this Court, under
28 U. S C. ยง 1254 (3), questions concerning the validity of a regulation of the Civil Aeronautics Board is dismissed on the authority

of cases cited in the opinion; and an application of the Board for
an order requiring the Court of Appeals to. send up the entire
record, thus bringing up "the entire matter in controversy" for
decision, is denied. Pp. 4-5.

The United States District Court for the District of
Columbia enjoined enforcement of a regulation of the
Civil Aeronautics Board unless and until plaintiffs were
afforded "a full and fair evidentiary hearing with respect
thereto." See 98F. Supp. 660. On appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, three judges were unable to agree on a disposition
of the case and certified to this Court questions concerning the validity of the regulation. The Civil Aeronautics
Board applied to this Court under Rule 37 (2) of the
Rules of. this Court for an order requiring the Court of
Appeals to send up the entire record. Certificate di8mis8ed and order denied, pp. 4-5.

Opinion of the Court.

v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 367 (1931); United States v. Union
Pacific R. Co., 168 U. S 505 (1897).
The Civil Aeronautics Board has applied to this Court
for an order requiring the Court of Appeals to send up the
entire record. To grant such an application would bring
"the entire matter in controversy" before the Court for
decision. 28 U. S. C. ยง 1.254 (3).
Since the certificate must be dismissed, the Court should
not exercise its discretionary power to bring up "the entire
matter in controversy" for review. See Cleveland-Cliffs
Iron Co. v. Arctic Iron Co., 248 U. S. 178 (1918). Perhaps the Court of Appeals may now wish to hear this
case en banc to resolve the deadlock indicated in the
certificate and give full review to the entire case. This
Court does not normally review orders of administrative
agencies in the first instance; and the Court does not desire to take any action at this time which might foreclose
the possibility of such review in the Court of Appeals.
For these reasons the Board's application is denied.
