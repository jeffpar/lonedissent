paid, as provided in § 322 (b) (1). The four-year period
prescribed by § 3313 is inapplicable to such claims. Since
respondent filed its income tax refund claim more than
three years after filing the return and more than two
years after payment of the tax, its claim was out of time.
That is true even though the claim arose out of an income
tax alleged to have been "erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected."

KAVANAGH, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. NOBLE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 70.

Argued November 18, 1947.-Decided December 22, 1947.

1. Assuming that the deficiency assessment and collection of the
federal income tax in this case were without legal authority, the
taxpayer's payment of that illegal assessment was an "overpayment" within the meaning of § 322 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and (the return having been filed more than three years
previously) a claim for refund was barred by limitations where
not filed within two years of the date of that payment. Jones v.
Liberty Glass Co., ante, p. 524. Pp. 536-538.
2. It is for Congress, not the courts, to provide remedies for inequities
resulting from the application of limitations on refunds of federal
taxes. P. 539.
160 F. 2d 104, reversed.

The District Court gave judgment for the respondent
in a suit upon a claim for refund of federal income tax.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case is a companion to Jones v. Liberty Glass Co.,
ante, p. 524.
The stipulated facts show that on March 16, 1936,
the respondent taxpayer filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue a joint individual inceme tax return for
himself and his wife for the calendar year 1935. This
disclosed a tax liability of $8,017.01, which was duly paid.
In the return the losses and gains from sales of capital
assets by the taxpayer and his wife were reported together,
the losses of the wife being deducted from the gains of
the husband, resulting in a net loss in excess of $2,000.
This amount (the allowable limit of loss) was deducted
on the return.
On June 7, 1937, the taxpayer was advised at a conference with revenue agents that there was additional
income tax due for the year 1935, aggregating $421.80.
The taxpayer's check, which was tendered for that
amount, was later returned to him. Then by a letter
dated June 11, 1937, a revenue agent notified the taxpayer that instead of a deficiency of $421.80 on the 1935
incopie tax return there was a deficiency of $19,973.93
and the taxpayer.was furnished a computation showing
the basis for such determination. The agent relied upon
Article 117-5, Treasury Regulations 86, later declared
void by this Court in Helvering v. Janney, 311 U. S. 189.
After protest and further conference, the taxpayer gave

Opinion of the Court.

the agent a check for $21,527.70, covering the then proposed deficiency assessment of $19,973.93, plus interest of
$1,553.77. This check was remitted to the United States
Treasury, after having been received by the Collector on
July 21, 1937.
On July 14, 1937, the taxpayer and his wife executed
an agreement waiving certain statutory restrictions in
their favor and consenting to the immediate assessment
and collection against them of 1935 income tax in the
principal sum of $19,973.93, plus deficiency interest of
$1.553.77, which the Commissioner thereafter assessed.
The agreement specified in a footnote that it was not
a final closing agreement under § 606 of the Revenue Act
of 1928 and that it did not therefore preclude the assertion of a further deficiency if one should be determined,
nor did it extend the statutory period of limitation for
refund, assessment or collection of the tax.
On January 28, 1941, the taxpayer and his wife filed
a claim for refund of $21,105.90, plus interest, on the
ground that there had been an illegal assessment and
collection since the revenue agents had "refused to allow
the losses of one spouse against the gains of the other
spouse in the joint return of husband and wife." Reference was made to § 3313 of the Internal Revenue Code,
specifying a four-year period of limitations. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected this claim in reliance upon § 322 (b) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1934 (the
same as § 322 (b) (1) of the Code), establishing a twoyear period of limitations; it was pointed out that § 3313
specifically excludes income taxes from those for which
a claim may be filed within four years after payment.
On July 12, 1941, the taxpayer filed his individual
claim for refund of $21,527.70 paid with respect to the
year 1935. The claim was on the same grounds as the
claim previously filed by the taxpayer and his wife. This
claim was returned with the request that the wife join

in the execution of the claim; this request was refused
and the claim was returned to the Collector; once again
the claim was returned to the taxpayer.
The taxpayer then brought this suit against the Col-

lector to recover the amount alleged to be due in the
refund claim. The District Court held that the decision
of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v.
Lederer Terminal W. Co., 139 F. 2d 679, controlled the
case and made it clear that the four-year period of § 3313
was applicable. Summary judgment was therefore entered for the taxpayer. 66 F. Supp. 258. The Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed per curiam, 160 F. 2d
104, citing its previous decision in the Lederer Terminal
case.
For reasons which we have set forth in Jones v. Liberty
Glass Co., ante, p. 524, the decision below cannot stand.
The two-year period provided by § 322 (b) (1), rather
than the four-year period of § 3313, governs income tax
refund claims. The overpayment which brings §322 (b)
(1) into operation occurs whenever the taxpayer has paid
an amount over and above his true liability. Hence, if
we assume that the deficiency assessment and collection
in this case were without legal authority, the taxpayer's
payment of that illegal assessment was an overpayment.
within the meaning of § 322 (b) (1). And he had two
years from the date of that payment within which to file
a claim for refund. Since he did not file his claim until
three and a half years after payment, the claim was out
of time.
It may well be that the taxpayer's refund claim was
prompted by this Court's decision in Helvering v. Janney,
supra,which set aside the Treasury regulation upon which
the deficiency assessment was based. That decision was
rendered on December 9, 1940, and the taxpayer filed his
first refund claim on January 28, 1941. But assuming
that the Janney decision makes clear that the taxpayer

here Wmade an overpayment, the loss which he now suffers
from an application of § 322 (b) (1) is a loss which is
inherent in the application of any period of limitations.
Such periods are established to'cut off rights, justifiable
or not, that might otherwise be asserted and they must
be-strictly adhered to by the judiciary. Rosenman
v: United States, 323 U. S. 658, 661. Remedies for resulting inequities are to be provided by Congress, not the
courts.
Moreover, it is not our province to speculate as to why
Congress established a shorter period of limitations relative to the income tax than is the case of those taxes
governed by § 3313. It is enough that § 322 (b) (1)
creates a two-year period applicable to all income tax
refund claims and that the claim in this case is of that
type.

Argued October 23, 1947.-Decided December 22, 1947.
The four petitioners and another defendant were tried jointly and
convicted for violating § 37 of the Criminal Code by conspiring
to sell whiskey at prices above the ceiling set by the Office of Price
Administration. Two of the defendants were the owner and sales
manager, respectively, of a business holding a wholesale liquor
license which was the ostensible owner of the whiskey; but they
were proven, solely by their own admissions, which were received
in evidence as to them alone, to have known that the concern
was acting as intermediary for an undisclosed owner. The other
