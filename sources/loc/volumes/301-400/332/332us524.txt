MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Our concern here is with the period of limitations applicable to the filing of claims for refund of federal income
taxes. Must such claims be filed within two years after
payment of the tax, as provided by § 322 (b) (1) of the
Internal Revenue Code, or within four years.after payment of the tax, as provided by § 3313"of the Code?
The corporate taxpayer, respondent herein, filed its
income and excess-profits tax return for 1938, a return
which indicated a tax liability of $1,193.25. This sum,
plus a small additional assessment, was paid in 1939. A
revenue agent later investigated the taxpayer's liability
again, resulting in an additional assessment of $6,646.81.

OCTOBER TERM, 1947.
Opinion of the Court.

332 U. S.

Payment of this amount was made on March 8, 1941.
Over three years later, on March 30, 1944, the taxpayer
filed a claim for refund of $1,053.49. It was stated that
the revenue agent erroneously had failed to allow certain
credits for sums used by the taxpayer in 1938 to reduce
its indebtedness. Reliance was placed by the taxpayer,
on the four-year limitation period specified in § 3313.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected this
claim, pointing out that § 3313 specifically exempts from
its application income, war-profits, excess-profits, estate
and gift taxes.
This suit was then brought by the taxpayer in the
District Court to recover the amount alleged by the
refund claim to be due. That court held that § 3313
was applicable and gave judgment for the taxpayer. 66
F. Supp. 254. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, one
judge dissenting, affirmed the judgment. 159 F. 2d 316.
The problem being one of importance in the administration of the revenue laws, we granted certiorari.
Section 322 (b) (1) is to be found in Subtitle A of the
Internal Revenue Code, a subtitle dealing with those
taxes over which the Tax Court has jurisdiction. Such
jurisdiction includes income, excess-profits, estate and gift
taxes. More specifically, § 322 (b) (1) appears under
Chapter 1 of the Code, pertaining to income taxes. It
is concerned with overpayments of income taxes and
provides quite simply that no refund shall be allowed
unless a claim for refund "is filed by the taxpayer within
three years from the time the return was filed by the
taxpayer or within two years from the time the tax was
paid ...
1 The

return in this case was filed in June, 1939. Since the c.%tm
was filed on March 30, 1944, no contention could be made that it
was within the three-year period from the date the return was
filed.

JONES v. LIBERTY GLASS CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Section 3313, on the other hand, is located under Subtitle B of the Code, a subtitle devoted to miscellaneous
taxes. It is in Chapter 28, which contains various provisions common to such taxes. And it is among those
provisions dealing with the assessment, collection and refund of the taxes. It reads as follows: "All claims for
the refunding or crediting of any internal revenue tax
alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or
collected, or of any penalty alleged to have been collected
without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been
excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected must,
except as otherwise provided by law in the case of income,
war-profits, excess-profits, estate, and gift taxes, be presented to the Commissioner within four years next after
the payment of such tax, penalty, or sum. The amount
of the refund (in the case of taxes other than income,
war-profits, excess-profits, estate, and gift taxes) shall not
exceed the portion of the tax, penalty, or sum-paid during
the four years immediately preceding the filing of the
claim, or if no claim was filed, then during the four years
immediately preceding the allowance of the refund."
The substance of § 3313 of the Code has long been a
part of federal statutory law. Its ancestry can be traced
back to 1872, when § 3228 of the Revised Statutes was
enacted.2 Section 3228 established a procedure for filing
claims for refund of any internal revenue tax alleged to
have been "erroneously or illegally assessed or collected"
and created a limitation period of two years from the time
the cause of action accrued, later extended in 1921 to four
years from the date of payment of the tax.' But soon
after the entry of the income tax into the federal scene in
1913, separate provision was made for the filing of claims

Section 3228 was in the nature of a revision of § 44 of the Act

of June 6, 1872, 17 Stat. 230, 257.

for refund of income taxes "paid in excess of those properly due." Section 14 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1916'
was the first such provision and it made clear that § 3228
was inapplicable to claims of this nature. Section 252 of
the Revenue Act of 1918,1 followed by § 252 of the 1921
Act,' continued this scheme of separate treatment. These
later provisions were written so as to include refund
claims relating to war-profits and excess-profits taxes as
well as those involving income taxes; and a limitation
of five years from the date the return was due was placed
on the filing of such claims. It was further specified
that the procedure therein detailed was to be followed
"notwithstanding the provisions" of § 3228.
Section 252, as it appeared in the 1921 Act, was then
changed in 1923' so as to permit claims for refund of
income and profits taxes "paid in excess of that properly

Act of March 4, 1923, 42 Stat. 1504, 1505. In amending § 252,
the Act of March 4, 1923, made mention of refunds of income taxes
to withholding agents which might be made under the provisions of
"section 3228 of the Revised Statutes." This was an obvious reference to the practice of the Treasury Department, admitted to be of
"very doubtful legality," H. R. Rep. No. 1424, 67th Cong., 4th Sess.,
p. 2, of allowing a taxpayer who had permitted an adlitional assessment after the five-year period from the due date of the return (specified by § 252 of the 1921 Act) to file a claim for refund within four
years after payment of the tax pursuant to § 3228), even though the
five-year period had elapsed. The Treasury had instituted this practice-to prevent inequities which might otherwise ensue to such taxpayers, but it was without legislative sanction. It was to take care
of the taxpayers who had taken aacrantage of the TreaSury practice
that the reference in question in thq Act of March 4, 1923, was made.
As to claims pending on March 4, 1923,which were timely filed under
j 3228, but not timely under § 252, refunds to withholding agents were
iecessarily to be made :under § 3228. This provision was not repeated

due" to be filed within two years after the tax was paid,
in addition to the five-year period after the due date of
the return. This change was made "so that the taxpayer
who has, by agreement with the Treasury, permitted the
time for the final, assessment of the taxes due from him
to be made after the expiration of the five-year period,
will not be barred from making a claim for a refund when
such assessment is made and the taxpayer alleges that
the assessment is illegal." 8 Amending § 252 rather than
§ 3228 of the Revised Statutes to accomplish this purpose was significant. It was an unequivocal indication
that § 252, in speaking of claims for refund of "excess"
payments of income and profits taxes, was designed by
its framers to include not only those payments growing
out of errors in the preparation of returns but also those
payments resulting from illegal or erroneous assessments.
See Grahamv. duPont,262 U. S.234, 258.
The Revenue Act of 1924 1 transferred the substance
of the former § 252 to a new § 281. A four-year period
of limitations from the date of the payment of the tax
was established, a period coinciding in length with that
prescribed by § 3228. The reference to the type of payments involved was recast; in place of speaking of payments "inexcess of that properly due," § 281 used the
simple term "overpayment." 10 And instead of stating
in § 281 that its provisions should apply "notwithstandin subsequent legislation and it was not indicative of a legislative
intent to permit income tax refund claims to be governed by § 3228 in
the future.

10 The Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 296, also created a new
§ 272, dealing with "overpayments" of income tax installments.
This spoke of overpayments in the sense of payments of "more than
the amount determined to be the correct amount of such installment."
This provision now exists as § 321 of the Internal Revenue Code.

ing the provisions" of § 3228 of the Revised Statutes,
§ 3228 itself was amended" to make it applicable to all
claims for the refunding or crediting of any. internal
revenue tax "except as provided in section 281 of the
Revenue Act of 1924." This placing of an exceptive
clause in § 3228 was done "to remove the doubt which
now exists as to whether or not the provisions of section
3228, Revised Statutes, apply in any event to income
taxes." 12 In other words, the statutory drafters intended
to make certain that § 3228 was in no event to apply to
income tax refund claims. Such claims-were to be governed exclusively by § 281.
The essence of § 281 of the 1924 Act has been carried
through to the present '§ 322 of the Internal Revenue
Code."3 The only significant change in the interval, for
our purposes, was a reduction in the period of limitations,
as measured from the payment of the tax, from four years
to three years and finally to two years. And § 3228 of the
Revised Statutes, as amended to state that it applies "except as otherwise provided by law in the case of income,
war-profits, excess-profits,, estate, and gift taxes," has become the current § 3313 of the Code.
With this background in mind, we find the patternof
limitation periods for tax refund claims to be clear.
Section 3313 of the Code establishes a four-year period
for all internal revenue taxes, except as otherwise provided

by law in the case of specified taxes. Among the latter
is the income tax, as to which § 322 (b) (1) makes provision. "otherwise" by requiring that refund claims be presented within two years of payment or within three years
from the filing of the return. Provisions are also made
"otherwise" in the case of the estate tax (§ 910 of the
Code) and the gift tax (§ 1027 of the Code).
The argument is made, however, that § 322 (b) (1)
deals only with income tax "overpayments" and not with
income taxes "erroneously or illegally assessed or collected." Overpayments are said to refer solely to excess
payments resulting from errors by taxpayers in the preparation of their returns or in related activities, while
erroneous or illegal assessments and collections are
claimed to relate to various kinds of errors on the part
of revenue agents. Since there is no provision "otherwise" for income tax refund claims involving the latter
type of errors, the conclusion is reached that the four-year
limitation period of § 3313 remains applicable. We cannot agree.
In the absence of some contrary indication, we must
assume that the framers of these statutory provisions intended to convey the ordinary meaning which is attached
to the language they used. See Rosenman v. United
States,323 U. S. 658,661. Hence we read the word "overpayment" in its usual sense, as meaning any payment in
excess of that which is properly due. Such an excess
payment may be traced to an error in mathematics or in
judgment or in interpretation of facts or law. And the
error may be committed by the taxpayer or by the revenue
agents. Whatever the reason, the payment of more than
is rightfully due is what characterizes an overpayment.
That this ordinary meaning is the one intended by the
authors of § 322 (b) (1) is quite evident from the legislative history which we have detailed. The word "over-

payment" first appeared in § 281 of the 1924 Revenue Act,
one of the direct ancestors of § 322 (b) (1). The word
was there used as a substitute for the previous reference
to payments "in excess of that properly due," a phrase
that is a perfect definition of an overpayment and that
is not necessarily confined to overpayments occasioned by
errors made by taxpayers. The immediate predecessor of
§ 281 had employed that phrase and had been enacted in
1923 with the expressed intention of including claims
growing out of illegal assessments. There was not the
slightest indication that the substitution of the word
"overpayment" was designed to narrow the scope of § 281.
It apparently was a mere simplification in phraseology.
But it does make clear the sense in which the word was
first used in this context. The generic character of the

basis for making it over into a word of art at this late
date.
The legislative history further reveals a consistent intention to make a separate and complete limitation provision for income tax refund claims, whatever might be
the underlying basis of the claims. Section 322 and its
predecessors were devised in order to provide such an
exclusive scheme. Claims relating to thp income tax
have at all times been explicitly excluded from § 3313.1"
14 Section 272 of the 1924 Act (now § 321 of the Code) referred
to "overpayments' of income tax installments as payments of "more
than the amount determined to be the correct amount of such installment." See note 10, supra. Such a definition admits of no distinction between errors by the taxpayer and errors by the revenue
agents.
U5Reference should also be made to the second sentence of § 3313,
providing that the amount of refund may.not exceed the amount of
tax'paid during the four-year period. There is a parenthetical phrase
in this sentence which specifically excludes income, war-profits, excessprofits, estate and gift taxes. If the first sentence of § 3313, establishing the four-year limitation, period, applied to income tax refund

Opinion of the Court.

This arrangement is but part of the general plan evident
in the Internal Revenue Code of providing separate treatment for the income, profits, estate and gift taxes, as distinct from the miscellaneous taxes and the excise, import
ind temporary taxes. We would be doing unwarranted
violence to this clear demarcation were we to read the
word "overpayment" so as to place certain types of income
tax refund claims within the scope of § 3313, a section
that has always been divorced from the income tax portion
of the revenue laws.
It is pointed out, however, that various lower federal
courts, beginning in 1939, have reached a contrary result."8
They have held that § 3313 rather than § 322 (b) (1)
governs refund claims for income taxes alleged to have
been "erroneously or illegally assessed or collected."
Since Congress has subsequently convened from time to
time and has amended § 322 in other respects without expressly disapproving this interpretation, the contention is
advanced that legislative acquiescence in the interpretation must be assumed. But the doctrine of legislative
claims arising out of illegal assessments, there would be no limit on
the amotnt of refund by reason of this second sentence. Such a
result is without sypport in the purpose or history of the provisions
dealing with these refund claitns. ,
16Huntley v. Suthern Oregon Sales, 102 F. 2d 538, was the first
case so holding. Subsequent decisions of the same tenor have relied
in large part upon the Huntley case. Olsen v. United States, 32 F.

70 F. Supp. 742. Compare Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. v.
United States, 67 F. Supp. 920. In many cases, however, the applicability of § 322 (b) (1) to claims of the type here involved was assumed
without question and without an explicit holding on the point. See,
for example, United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U. S. 528.

acquiescence is at best only an auxiliary tool for use in
interpreting ambiguous statutory provisions. See Helvering v. Reynolds, 313 U. S. 428, 432. Here the language
and the purpose of Congress seem clear to us. The arrangement whereby all income tax refund claims are to be
governed by what is now § 322 (b) (1) was established in
an unmistakable manner nearly a quarter of a century ago,
an arrangement that has been continued through various
reenactments and changes in the revenue laws. And that
arrangement has been consistently recognized and followed by the Treasury Department." Under those circumstances, it would take more than legislative silence
in the face of rather recent contrary decisions by lower
federal courts to overcome the factors upon which we
have placed reliance. Cf. Electric Battery Co. v. Shimadzu, 307 U. S. 5, 14; Missouri v. Ross, 299 U. S. 72,
75; United States v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 298 U. S. 492,
500. We do not expect Congress to make an affirmative
move every time a lower court indulges in an erroneous
interpretation. In short, the original legislative language
speaks louder than such judicial action.
We accordingly conclude that all income tax refund
claims, whatever the reasons giving rise to the claims,
must be filed within three years from the time the return
was filed or within two years from the time the tax was

prescribed by § 3313 is inapplicable to such claims. Since
respondent filed its income tax refund claim more than
three years after filing the return and more than two
years after payment of the tax, its claim was out of time.

previously) a claim for refund was barred by limitations where
not filed within two years of the date of that payment. Jones v.
