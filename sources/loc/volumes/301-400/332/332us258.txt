Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTIWE JAcKsoN delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This petition by John H. Fahey, individually and as
Federal Home Loan Bank Commissioner, and A. V. Ammann, individually and as Conservator for the Long
'Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association, invokes the
original jurisdiction of this Court. They ask leave to file
petition for a writ of "mandamus and/or prohibitiori
and/or injunction" against Judge Peirson M. Hall of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
California to vacate his order allowing fees to counsel in'
Fahey v. Mallonee, decided today, ante, p. 245, to prohibit
any further allowance therein, and to enjoin any payments heretofore allowed.
While an appeal in the principal case was pending in
this Court, application was made by various counsel for
the plaintiffs and associated interests therein for allowance of fees aggregating some $125,000. The District
Court allowed counsel for plaintiffs $50,000 as a partial
payment oh account of services, but withheld action on
other applications. Certain costs and .expenses of the
plaintiffs in the amount of $17,295.13 were also ordered
reimbursed.
The petition involves serious questions of law and of
fact. Whether, because of the pendency of the appeal and
the stay order graxited therein, the District Court had
power to entertain the application, whether before the
final outcome of'-the case could be known an allowance
was premature, whether the source of the fund on deposit
with the court was so related to the services as to be subject to disbursement for their compensation, and whether
one judge can make allowances in a case before a threejudge court, are, with other questions, much contested.
We do not decide any question as to the merits.
Mandamus, prohibition and injunction against judges
are drastic and extraordinary remedies. We do not doubt

power in a proper case to issue such writs. But they have
the unfortunate consequence of making the judge a litigant, obliged to obtain personal counsel or to leave his
defense to one of the litigants before him. These remedies
should be resorted to only where appeal is a clearly inadequate remedy. We are unwilling to utilize them as
substitutes for appeals. As extraordinary remedies, they
are reserved for really extraordinary causes.
We find nothing in this case to warrant their use. An
allowance of $50,000 will hardly destroy a twenty-sixmillion-dollar association during the time it would take
to prosecute an appeal. The status of one of the applicants in the principal case is now settled so that he has
standing to take all authorized appeals. We hold that the
applicants' grievance is one to be pursued by appeal at
the proper time and to the appropriate court, rather than
by resort to our original jurisdiction for extraordinary
writs.
The petition is
Denied.
