SUNAL v. LARGE, SUPERINTENDENT, FEDERAL
PRISON CAMP.
NO. 535.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued April 1, 1947.-Decided June 23, 1947.
1. In a criminal prosecution under the Selective Training and Service

Act of 1940 for failure to submit to induction into the Army, a
federal district court improperly denied to a defendant who had fully
exhausted his administrative remedy the right to defend on the
ground of the invalidity of his classification by the local Board as
available for military service rather than as an exempt minister of

religion. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment but
took no appeal. Held: He could not later obtain a review of his
conviction by a habeas corpus proceeding. Pp. 175-184.
2. In the circumstances of this case, the failure of the defendant to
take an appeal from the judgment of conviction can not be justified
on the ground that an appeal was deemed futile because of the
state of the law at that time--i. e., after the decision of this
Court. in Falbo v. United States, 320 U. S. 549, and before the
decision in Estep v. United States, 327 U. S.114. P. 181.
3. The trial court's error in the ruling on the question of law did not
deprive the defendant of any right under the Federal Constitution.
P. 182.
157 F. 2d 165, affirmed.
157 F. 2d 811, reversed.

No. 535. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the District
Court discharged the writ and remanded petitioner to the
custody of the respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 157 F. 2d 165. This Court granted certiorari. 329 U. S.712. Affirmed, p. 184.
No. 840. In a habeas corpus proceeding, the District
Court discharged the writ and remanded the relator here
to custody. 66 F. Supp. 183. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and ordered the discharge of the relator
from custody. 157 F. 2d 811. This Court granted certiorari. 329 U. S. 712. Reversed, p. 184.
Irving S. Shapiro argued the cause for petitioner in
No. 840 and respondent in No. 535. With him on the
briefs were Acting Solicitor General Washington and
Robert S. Erdahl. Frederick Bernays Wiener was also
on the brief in No. 840.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Sunal and Kulick registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 885, 57 Stat. 597, 50
U. S. C. App. § 301, et seq. Each is a Jehovah's Witness
and each claimed the exemption granted by Congress to
regular or duly ordained ministers of religion." § 5 (d).
The local boards, after proceedings unnecessary to relate
here, denied the claimed exemptions and classified these
registrants as I-A. They exhausted their administrative
remedies but were unable to effect a change in their classi2

Skmal in 1942 was classified as a conscientious objector and ordered

to report for work of national importance. On his failure to do so
he was convicted under the Act and a fine and term of imprisonment
were imposed. The events with which we are now concerned relate
to his classification after his discharge from prison.

fications. Thereafter they were ordered to report for induction-Sunal on October 25, 1944, Kulick on November
9, 1944. Each reported but refused to submit to induction. Each was thereupon indicted, tried and convicted
under § 11 of the Act for refusing to submit to induction.
Sunal was sentenced on March 22, 1945, Kulick on May 7,
1945, each to imprisonment for a term of years. Neither
appealed.
At the trial each offered evidence to show that his selective service classification was invalid. The trial courts
held, however, that such evidence was inadmissible, that
the classification was final and not open to attack in the
criminal trial. On February 4, 1946, we decided Estep v.
United States and Smith v. United States, 327 U. S. 114.
These cases 2 held on comparable facts that a registrant,
who had exhausted his administrative remedies and thus
obviated the rule of Falbo v. United $tates, 320 U. S. 549,
was entitled, when tried under § 11, to defend on the
ground that his local board exceeded its jurisdiction in
making the classification-for example, that it had no
basis in fact. 327 U. S. pp. 122-123.
It is plain, therefore, that the trial courts erred in denying Sunal and Kulick the defense which they tendered.
Shortly after the Estep and Smith cases were decided,
petitions for writs of habeas corpus were filed on behalf
of Sunal and Kulick. In each case it was held that
habeas corpus was an available remedy. In Sunal's case
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held
that there was a basis in fact for the classification and affirmed a judgment discharging the writ. 157 F. 2d 165.
2 The

Smith case was decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals on
April 4, 1945, 148 F. 2d 288,; the petition for certiorari was filed
April 25, 1945, and granted May 28, 1945. 325 U. S. 846. The
Estep case was decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals on July 6,
1945, 150 F. 2d 768; the petition for certiorari was filed August 3,
1945, and granted October 8, 1945. 326 U. S. 703.

SUNAL v. LARGE.
174

Opinion of the Court.

In Kulick's case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reversed a District Court holding that
there was evidence to support the classification, 66 F.
Supp. 183, and ruled, without examining the evidence, that
since Kulick had been deprived of the defense he should
be discharged from custody without prejudice to further
prosecution. 157 F. 2d 811. The cases are here on petitions for writs of certiorari, which we granted because of
the importance of the questions presented.
The normal and customary method of correcting errors
of the trial is by appeal. Appeals could have been taken
in these cases,' but they were not. It cannot be said that
absence of counsel made the appeals unavailable as a practical matter. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 467.
Defendants had counsel. Nor was there.any other barrier
to the perfection of their appeals. Cf. Cochranv. Kansas,
316 U. S. 255. Moreover, this is not a situation where the
facts relied on were dehors the record and therefore not
open to consideration and review on appeal. See Waley v.
Johnston,316 U. S. 101, 104; United States ex rel. McCann
v. Adams, 320 U. S. 220, 221. And see Adams v. United
States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 274-275. The error
was of record in each case. It is said, however, that the
failure to appeal was excusable, since under the decisions
as they then stood-March 22, 1945, and May 7, 1945the lower courts had consistently ruled that the selective
service classification could not be attacked in a prosecution
under § 11. See Estep v. United States, supra, p. 123,
n. 15. It is also pointed out that on April 30,1945, we had
denied certiorari in a case which sought to raise the same
8

We therefore lay to one side cases such as Bridges v. Wizon, 326

U. S. 135, Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, and Eagles v. United
States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U. S. 304, where the order of the agency
under which -petitioner was detained was not subject to judicial
review.

point,4 and that Estep v. UnitedStates, supra,and Smith v.
UnitedStates, supra,were brought here 5 and decided after
Sunal's and Kulick's time for appeal had passed. The
argument. is that since the state of the law made the appeals seem futile, it would be unfair to those registrants to
conclude them by their failure to appeal.
We put to one side comparable problems respecting the
use of habeas corpus in the federal courts to challenge convictions obtained in the state courts. See New York v.
Eno, 155 U. S. 89; Tinsley v. Anderson, 171 U. S. 101,104105; United States ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler, 269 U. S. 13;
Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114, 116-117. So far as convictions obtained in the federal courts are concerned, the
general rule is that the writ of habeas corpus will not be
allowed to do service for an appeal. Adams v. United
States ex rel. McCann, supra, p. 274. There have
been, however, some exceptions. That is to say, the writ
has at times been entertained either without consideration
of the adequacy of relief by the appellate route or where
an appeal would have afforded an adequate remedy. Illustrative are those instances where the convictio was
under a federal statute alleged to be unconstitutional,'
where there was a conviction by a federal court whose
jurisdiction over the person or the offense was challenged where the trial or sentence by a federal court vio4Rinko

in Flakowicz v. United States, 325 U. S. 851; but it, like Falbo v.
United States, supra, was one where the administrative remedies had
not been exhausted, there being an.additional examination which the

registrant had not taken. See Gibson v. United States, 329 U. S.

lated specific constitutional guaranties.8 It is plain, however, that the writ is not designed for collateral review of
errors of law committed by the trial court-the existence
of any evidence to support the conviction,' irregularities in
the grand jury procedure, 10 departure from a statutory
grant of time in which to prepare for trial," and other
errors in trial procedure which do not cross the jurisdictional line. Cf. Craigv. Hecht, 263 U. S. 255.
Yet the latter rule is not an absolute one; and the situations in which habeas corpus has done service for an
appeal are the exceptions. Thus where the jurisdiction of
the federal court which tried the case is challenged or
where the constitutionality of the federal statute under
which conviction was had is attacked, habeas corpus is
increasingly denied in case an appellate procedure was
available for correction of the error. 12 Yet, on the other
hand, where the error was flagrant and there was no other
remedy available for its correction, relief by habeas corpus
has sometimes been granted."3 As stated by Chief JusSEx parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (double jeopardy); In re Snow,
120 U. S. 274 (same); In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (same); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 (self-incrimination); Ex parte Wilson, 114 U. S. 417 (requirement of indictment); Ex parte Bain, 121

habeas corpus is available not to weigh the evidence to support the

to support it. Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 84. It is also available to
determine whether removal to the district in question violates a constitutional right of the accused, Haas v. Henkel, 216 U. S. 462, or

tice Hughes in Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27, the
rule which requires resort to appellate procedure for the
correction of errors "is not one defining power but one
which relates to the appropriate exercise of power." That
rule is, therefore, "not so inflexible that it may not yield
to exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent."
Id. p. 27. That case was deemed to involve "exceptional
circumstances" by reason of the fact that it indicated "a
conflict between state and federal authorities on a question of law involving concerns of large importance affecting their respective jurisdictions." Id. p. 27. The Court
accordingly entertained the writ to examine into the jurisdiction of the court to render the judgment of conviction.
The same course was followed in Ex parte Hudgings,
249 U. S. 378, where petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt for committing perjury. The Court did not require the petitioner to pursue any appellate route but
issued an original writ and discharged him, holding that
perjury without more was not punishable as a contempt.
That situation was deemed exceptional in view of "the
nature of the case, of the relation which the question which
it involves bears generally to the power and duty of courts
in the performance of their functions, of the dangerous
effect on the liberty of the citizen when called upon as a
witness in a court which might result if the erroneous
doctrine upon which the order under review was based
were not promptly corrected .

Id. p. 384.

Cf.

Craigv. Hecht, supra.
The Circuit Courts of Appeals thought that the facts
of the present cases likewise presented exceptional cirwhether the court before which it is proposed to take and try the
accused has jurisdiction over the offense. Salinger v. Loieel, 265
U. S. 224. But habeas corpus will not be entertained to pass on the
question of jurisdiction where it involves consideration of many facts
and seriously controverted questions of law. Rodman v. Pothier;264
U. S. 399; Henry v. Henkel, 235 U. S. 219.

Opinion of the Court.

cumstances which justified resort to habeas corpus though
no appeals were taken. In their view the failure to appeal
was excusable, since relief by that route seemed quite
futile.
But denial of certiorari by this Court in the earlier case
imported no expression of opinion on the merits. House
v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42,48, and cases cited. The same chief
counsel represented the defendants in the present cases
and those in the Estep and Smith cases. At the time these
defendants were convicted the Estep and Smith cases were
pending before the appellate courts. The petition in the
Smith case was, indeed, filed here about two weeks before
KMilick's conviction and about a month after Sunal's conviction. The same-road was open to Sunal and Kulick as
the one Smith and Estep took. Why the legal strategy
counseled taking appeals in the Smith and Estep cases
and not in these we do not know. Perhaps it was based
on the facts of these two cases. For the question of law
had not been decided by the Court; and counsel was
pressing for a decision here. The case, therefore, is not
one where the law was changed after the time for appeal
had expired. Cf. Warring v. Colpoys, 122 F. 2d 642. It
is rather a situation where at the time of the convictions
the definitive ruling on the question of law had not crystallized. Of course, if Sunal and Kulick had pursued the
appellate course, and failed, their cases would be quite
different. But since they chose not to pursue the remedy
which they had, we do not think they should now be allowed to justify their failure by saying they deemed any
appeal futile.
We are dealing here with a problem which has radiations far beyond the present cases. The courts which
tried the defendants had jurisdiction over their persons
and over the offense. They committed an error of law in
excluding the defense which was tendered. That error
did not go to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Congress,

OCTOBER TERM, 1946.
Opinion of the Court.

332 U. S.

moreover, has provided a regular, orderly method for correction of all such errors by granting an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and by vesting us with certiorari
jurisdiction. It is not uncommon after a trial is ended
and the time for appeal has passed to discover that a shift
in the law or the impact of a new decision has given increased relevance to a point made at the trial but not pursued on appeal. Cf. Warring v. Colpoys, supra. If
in, such circumstances, habeas corpus could be used to
correct the error, the writ would become a delayed motion
for a new trial, renewed from time to time as the legal
climate changed. Error which was not deemed sufficiently adequate to warrant an appeal would acquire new
implicatiofns. Every error is potentially reversible error;
and many rulings of the trial court spell the difference
between conviction and acquittal. If defendints who accept the judgment of conviction and do not appeal can
later renew their attack on the judgment by habeas corpus,
litigation in these criminal cases will be interminable.
Wise judicial administration of the federal courts counsels
against such course, at least where the error does not
trench on any constitutional rights of defendants nor involve the jurisdiction of the trial court.
An endeavor is made to magnify the error in these
trials to constitutional proportions by asserting that
the refusal of the proffered evidence robbed the trial
of vitality by depriving defendants of their only real
defense. But as much might be said of many rulings during a criminal trial. Defendants received
throughout an opportunity to be heard and enjoyed
all procedural guaranties granted by the Constitution.
Error in ruling on the question of law did not infect the
trial with lack of procedural due process. As stated by
Mr. Justice Cardozo in Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U. S. 490, 494,
"When a hearing is allowed but there is error in conducting it or in limiting its scope, the remedy is by appeal.

SUNAL v. LARGE.
174

Opinion of the Court.

When an opportunity to be heard is denied altogether, the
ensuing-nandate of the court is void, and the prisoner
confined thereunder may have recourse to habeas corpus
to put an end to the restraint."
It is said -that the contrary position was indicated by
the following statement in Estep v. United States, supra,
pp. 124-125,
"But if we now hold that a registrant could not defend at his trial on the ground that the local board
had no jurisdiction in the premises, it would seem
that the way would then be open to him to challenge
the jurisdiction of the local board after conviction
by habeas corpus. The court would then be sending
men to jail today when it was apparent that they
would have to be released tomorrow."
We were there examining the alternative pressed on us-that the classification could not be attacked at the trial.
If we denied the defense, we concluded that habeas corpus
would lie the moment after conviction. For one convicted of violating an illegal order.of a selective service
board, like one convicted of violating an unconstitutional
statute, should be afforded an opportunity at some .stage
to establish tl6e fact. And where no other opportunity
existed, habeas corpus would be the appropriate remedy."'
But that was an additional reason for allowing the defense
in the criminal' trial, not a statement that defendants
prosecuted under § 11 had an alternative of defending at
the trial on the basis of an illegal classification or resorting
to habeas corpus after conviction. These registrants had
available a method of obtaining the right to defend their
prosecutions under § 11 on that ground. They did not use

concurs in the result.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.
That habeas corpus cannot be made to do service for
an appeal is a well-worn formula. But this generalization
should not dispose of these two cases, if their actualities
are viewed in the light of our decisions.
The First Judiciary Act empowered the courts of the
United States to issue writs of habeas corpus. Section 14
of the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 81. Since the
scope of the writ was not defined by Congress, it carried
its common law implications. The writ was greatly
enlarged after the Civil War by the Act of February 5,
1867. 14 Stat. 385. (For legislation dealing with habeas
corpnus see note in 18 F. 68.) It was no longer limited
to searching the face of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. It was available to cut through
forins and go "to the very tissue of the structure," Mr.
Justice Holmes in Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 345,
546, though it was certainly not to be invoked merely as
a substitute for an available appeal. But what is "form"
and what is the "tissue of the structure," and when is a
writ sought in fact as a substitute for an appeal in a practical view of the admin stration of justice, are questions to
which out decisions g' e dubious and confused answers.
I think it is fair to say that the scope oi habeas corpus in
the federal courts is an untidy area of our law that calls
for much more systematic consideration than it has thus
far received.

SUNAL v. LARGE.
174

FRANKFURTER,

J., dissenting.

The extent to which this Court has left itself unhampered, by not drawing sharp jurisdictional lines, is indicated by the following very tentative classification of
categories in which habeas corpus has not been deemed
beyond the power of federal courts to entertain:
(1) Conviction by a federal court which had no jurisdiction either over the person or of the offense. See Ex
parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203; Ex parte Parks,93 U. S.
18, 23. But the writ is discretionary and may not issue
even though if an opportunity were allowed such want of
jurisdiction might be established. See Toy Toy v. Hopkins, 212 U. S. 542, and Rodman v. Pothier,264 U. S. 399.
And compare In re Mayfield, 141 U. S. 107, with In re
Blackbird,66 F. 541.
(2) Conviction under unconstitutional statute. Ex
parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 343; Ex parte Siebold, 100
U. S. 371; Ex parte Curtis, 106 U. S. 371; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651. The writ was denied in each
case, but the Court passed on the constitutionality of
the statute. Here too the availability of the writ will
depend on the circumstances of the case, particularly
the stage in the criminal proceedings at which the writ
is sought. Johnson v. Hoy, 227 U. S. 245; Henry v.
Henkel, 235 U. S. 219. Compare Glasgow v. Moyer, 225
U. S. 420, with Matter of Gregory, 219 U. S. 210. See
also In re Lincoln; 202 U. S. 178.
(3) Violation by federal courts of specific constitutional rights: (a) double jeopardy. Compare Ex parte
Bigelow, 113 U. S. 328, with In re Snow, 120 U. S. 274, and
Nielsen, Petitioner,131 U. S. 176; (b) self-crimination.
Writ granted as to a witness held in contempt, though apparently not as to a defendant restrained on charge of
crime. Compare Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547,
and Ex parte Irvine, 74 F. 954 (Taft, Circuit Judge), with
Matter of Moran, 203 U. S. 96; (c) no indictment by

grand jury. Ex parte Wilson, 114 U. S. 417. Also Ex
parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1. As to denial of constitutional
rights in State courts, Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86.
(4) Due regard for harmonious Nation-State relations,
need to avoid friction and maintain balance. See Ex parte
Rowland, 104 U. S. 604; In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443; In
re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200; Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19.
Compare In re Tyler, ,149 U. S. 164; In re Swan, 150 U. S.
637; Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123. Availability of
other remedies is here an important factor. Similarly
as to State interference with federal officers, prompt relief
may be deemed necessary. Ohio v. Thomas, 173 U. S.
276. See also In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1; Hunter v. Wood,
209 U. S.205.
(5) Insufficiency of indictments is not open on habeas
corpus; it may be in removal cases, in view of the hardship to the individual and the inadequacy of other remedies. Compare Tinsley v. Treat, 205 U. S. 20; also Hyde
v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62. Compare also the extradition
cases. Benson v. McMahon, 127 U. S. 457; Ornelas v.
Ruiz, 161 U. S. 502; Bryant v: United States, 167 U. S.
104.
(6) Defects in jury panel, in trial procedure, exclusion
or insufficiency of evidence, are rarely held ground for
relief on habeas corpus. But when no other remedy was
available and the error appeared flagrant, there have been
instances of relief. See Tinsley v. Treat, 205 U. S. 20.
Compare Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1.
(7) Legality of sentence or conditions of confinement.
Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163; In re Bonner, 151 U. S.
242.
(8) Contempt cases. Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U. S.
378, 384. Compare, Savin, Petitioner,131 U. S. 267, and
Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280. But when appeal is
sufficient remedy, see Craig v. Hecht, 263 U. S. 255, and

RUTLEDGE,

J., dissenting.

Judge Learned Hand's dissenting opinion in the Craig
case, 282 F. 138, 155.
Perhaps it is well that a writ the historic purpose of
which is to furnish "a swift and imperative remedy in all
cases of illegal restraint," see Lord Birkenhead, L. C.,
Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O'Brien, [.1923]
A. C. 603, 609, should be left fluid and free from the definiteness appropriate to ordinary jurisdictional doctrines.
But if we are to leave the law pertaining to habeas corpus
in the unsystematized condition in which we find it, then
I believe it is true of both cases what Judge Learned Hand
said of the Kulick case, that the writ is necessary "to prevent a complete miscarriage of justice." 157 F. 2d 811,
813. If the justification need be no more definite than
the existence of "exceptional circumstances," Bowen v.
Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27, the reasons for allowing the
writs in these cases are more compelling than were those
in Bowen v. Johnston, where there merely appeared "to be
uncertainty and confusion . . . whether offenses within
the . . . National Park are triable in the state or federal
courts." For the reasons set forth in Judge Hand's opinion, it "would pass all fair demands upon Kulick's
diligence to conclude him because of his failure to appeal."

I agree with both Circuit Courts of Appeals that habeas
corpus was available as a remedy in the circumstances of
these cases, but since the Court does not consider the
merits, I shall abstain from doing so.

terizing ordinary jurisdictional doctrines. And I agree
with Judge Learned Hand, in the view stated for the
Circuit Court of Appeals in Kulick's case, that upon the
sum of our decisions,' regardless of the variety of statement in the opinions, no more definite rule is to be drawn
out than that "the writ is available, not only to determine points of jurisdiction, stricti juris, and constitutional
questions; but whenever else resort to -it is necessary to
prevent a complete miscarriage of justice." 157 F. 2d
811,813.
In my opinion not only is this the law, measured by
the sum of the decisions and the applicable statute,' but
the aggregate of the results demonstrates it should be
the law.
Confusion in the opinions there is, in quantity. But
it arises in part from the effort to pin down what by
its nature cannot be confined in special, all-inclusive
categories, unless the office of the writ is to be diluted
or destroyed where that should not happen. And so
limitation in assertion gives way to the necessity for
achieving the writ's historic purpose when the two collide. Admirable as may be the effort toward system,

this last resort for human liberty cannot yield when the
choice is between tolerating its wrongful deprivation and
maintaining the systematist's art.
The writ should be available whenever there clearly
has been a fundamental miscarriage of justice for which
no other adequate remedy is preseiitly available. Beside
executing its great object, which is the preservation of
personal liberty and assurance against its wrongful,dbprivation, considerations of economy of judicial time and
procedures, important as they undoubted',, are, become
comparatively insignificant.3 This applies to situations
involving the past existence of a remedy presently foreclosed, as well as to others where no such remedy has
ever been afforded.
In the prevailing state of our criminal law, federal
and state, there are few errors, either fundamental or
of lesser gravity, which cannot be corrected by appeal
'timely taken, unless the facts disclosing or constituting
them arise after the time has expired. If the existence
of a remedy by appeal at some stage of the criminal
proceedings is to be taken for the criterion, then in very
few instances, far less than the number comprehended
by our decisions, will the writ be available.. Taken literally," the formula so often repeated, that the writ is
not a substitute for appeal, is thus in conflict with every
case where the ground upon which the writ has been
allowed either "wasor might have been asserted on appeal.'
sIt is for this reason that the doctrine of res judicata does not
apply to habeas corpus determinations, Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S.
101, 105, although a prior rdfusal to discharge the prisoner on a like
application may be given weight, Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 231,
for obvious reasons of judicial administration.
' In the following cases the Court either passed upon the substance
of the contentions presented in the petition for writ of habeas corpus

The formula has obvious validity in the sense that
the writ is not readily to be used for overturning determinations made on appeal or for securing review where
no specification has been made or' no appeal has been
taken of matters not going to make the conviction a
gross miscarriage of justice.
But any effort to shut off the writ's functioning merely
because appeal has not been taken in a situation where,
but for that fact alone, the writ would issue, seems to
me to prescribe a system of forfeitures in the last area
where such a system should prevail. Certainly a basic
miscarriage of justice is no less great or harmful, either
to the individual or to the general cause of personal
liberty, merely because appeal has not been taken, than
where appeal is taken but relief is wrongfully denied.
These considerations apply with special force,' though
not exclusively, where good reason existed, as I think
did here, for failure to note the appeal in the brief time
or held that the petitiofir was entitled to a hearing, although, so far
as appears, at the time the petition was filed the time to appeal had
expired, e. g., Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19; Walker v. Johnston,
312 U. S. 275; Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, see The Writ of
Habeas Corpus in the Federal Courts (1935) 35 Col. L. Rev. 404,
414, n.. 66; an appeal. had already been taken, Moore v. Dempsey,
261 U. S. 86; or the time to appeal had not expired, Hunter v. Wood,
.209 U. S. 205; In re' Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200; Wo Lee v. Hopkins,
118 U. S. 356, discussed in The Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Federal
Courts, supra, at 414, n. 60. See also Appleyard v. Massachusetts,

In his dissenting opinion in Ex parte Craig, supra note 1, Judge
Learned Hand, reviewing the authorities, said: ."The appellant's'
attempt rigidly to classify these exceptions appears to me more
definite than the books warrant. A safer rule is to say somewhat
vaguely that they must be occasions of pressing necessity." 282 F.

allowed.' Whether or not the inferior federal courts were
justified in taking the Falbo decision ' for more thai its
specific ruling, the fact remains that their broadly prevailing view was that that case had cut off all right to
make such defenses as Sunal and Kulick tendered.
5 The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Kulick case,
after stating the summarized effect of our decisions as quoted in the
text above, said concerning this case: "The occasion at bar is such;
certainly the reasons for allowing it are more compelling than were
those in Bowen v. Johnston [see notes 3, 4, supra], where there merely
appeared 'to be uncertainty and confusion . . . whether offenses
within' a national park 'are triable in the state or federal courts.' It
would pass all fair demands upon Kulick's diligence to conclude him
because of his failure to appeal. Not only had there not been any
glimmer of a positive chance of success, but there had been an unusual
consensus of judicial opinion against it in the lower courts. Moreover, although a number of the decisions could be explained upon the
ground that those inducted had not wholly exhausted their administrative remedies; in a number of others they had done so; and no
distinction had been established between the two. Indeed, in United
States v.. Flakowicz, supra [146 F. 2d 874], which had been one of
these, the, Supreme Court denied certiorari only a fortnight before
May -12th," the date of Kulick's conviction. 157 F. 2d at 813-814.
See note 9 infra.
6 Falbo v. United States; 320 U. S. 549. The opinion, though containing language emphasizing trie failure of Congress to provide expressly for judicial review of selective service boards' classifications,
explicitly pointed out that "a board order to report is no more than
a necessary intermediate step in a united and continuous process
designed to raise an army speedily and efficiently" and that, if there
were a constitutional requirement for judicial review, "Congress was
not required to provide for judicial intervention before final acceptance of an individual for national service." Pp. 553, 554. The
opinion also stated: "Surely if Congress had intended to authorize
interference with that process by intermediate challenges of orders
to report, it would have said so." P. 554. (Emphasis added.)

In that prevailing climate of opinion in those courts,
there was hardly any chance that appeal to the federal
circuit courts of appeals would bring relief by their action.'
The chances for reversal therefore hung almost exclusively upon the doubtful, not to say slender,' chance that
this Court in the exercise of its discretionary power would
grant certiorari.
The deprivation here was of the right to make any
substantial defense. 0 I do not think a trial which forecloses the basic right to defend, upon the only valid
ground available for that purpose, is any less unfair or
conclusive as against the office of habeas corpus than
one which takes place when the court is without jurisdiction to try the offense, as when the charge is made
under an unconstitutional statrte or for other reason
sets forth no lawfully prescribed offense, or when the
court loses jurisdiction by depriving the accused of his
8In reference to Kulick's' case the chance was practically nil, since
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit previously had
ruled the question adversely to the validity of the defenses in United
States v. Flakowicz, 146 F. 2d 874, and certiorari had been denied
here. 325 U. S. 851. See note 5.
Smith v. United States, 148 F. 2d 288, afterwards reversed here,
327 U. S. 114, apparently was the first in which the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decided the question. The decision
was rendered April 4, 1945. Sunal'was convicted on March 22,1945.,

Although denial of certiorari is not to be taken as expression of
opinion in any case, it would be idle to claim that it has no actual or
reasonable influence upon the practical judgment of lawyers whether
appeal should be noted and taken upon the chance that in a case
substantially identical this Court's discretion would be exercised, in
the absence of conflict, in a contrary manner at the stage of application for certiorari.
20 Under the rule applied in the district courts and the circuit
courts of appeals the only defenses open would have been that the
defendants had not refused to take the oaths. No defense relating
to the validity of the statute, the regulations, or their application in
the particular cases was available.

constitutional right to counsel. That right is no more
and no less than an important segment of the right to
have any valid defense advanced and considered. It
becomes almost meaningless if the larger right to defend
is itself cut off. 1
