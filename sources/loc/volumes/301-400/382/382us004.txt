The Court today disposes summarily of four New
York reapportionment cases; it retains jurisdiction of a
fifth, Lomenzo v. WMCA, Inc., No. 81, which raises substantial questions similar to some of those involved in a
set of Hawaii reapportionment cases, Burns v. Richardson, No. 318; Cravalho v. Richardson, No. 323; and Abe
v. Richardson, No. 409, with respect to which probable

in so doing it rejected contentions that apportioning on a
basis of citizen population violates the Federal Constitution, and that partisan "gerrymandering" may be subject
to federal constitutional attack under the Fourteenth
Amendment. In affirming this decision, this Court
necessarily affirms these two eminently correct principles.
Quite evidently Plan A was seen by the District Court,
and is also viewed by this Court, as but a temporary
measure: In holding the plan federally acceptable for
the purpose of electing a special 1966 Legislature, the
District Court explicitly abstained from dealing with
challenges to the plan under the State Constitution.
Judge Waterman also noted that although Plan A met
federal constitutional requirements, "Of course, the ultimate fitness of the scheme for their needs and purposes is
for the people of the State of New York, themselves, to
decide, and not for this court to mandate." 238 F.
Supp., at 927.
Subsequent to the decision below in WMCA, the New
York Court of Appeals held Plan A (as well as Plans B,
C, and D) unconstitutional as a matter of state law.' In
now dismissing for lack of a substantial federal question
the appeal from that decision (Rockefeller v. Orans, No.
319) insofar as it may bear upon any apportionment plan
effective after the expiration of the 1966 New York Legislature, I take it that the Court is asserting that any final
apportionment plan must comport with state as well as
8In re Orans, 15 N. Y. 2d 339, 206 N. E. 2d 854. The Court of
Appeals held Plans A, B, C, and D invalid under Art. III, § 2, of the
New York Constitution which states, "The assembly shall consist of
one hundred and fifty members." All four plans provided for larger
assemblies: Plan A, 165 assemblymen, c. 976, § 301; Plan B, 180
assemblymen, c. 977, § 301; Plan C, 186 assemblymen (having a
total of 165 votes), c. 979, § 301; Plan D, 174 assemblymen (having
a total of 150 votes), c. 981, § 301.

as I can see no satisfactory way to heal, at this juncture,
the wounds to federal-state relations caused by the District Court's order without inflicting even greater ones.
The upshot of what is done today is, then, to suspend
New York's 150-member constitutional provision for the
one-year duration of the 1966 Legislature, a result to
which I subscribe only under the compulsion of what has
gone before in this Court.

A decision on the merits by this Court is unavoidable. The appeal
from the three-judge District Court is brought here under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253 (1964 ed.), and I do not believe this case, or a fortiori any of
the other New York reapportionment cases presently before the
Court, is moot. Surely if this Court now held that the District
Court erred in ordering the election under Plan A, it has the power,
for example, to enjoin the November 2 election and to order the
District Court to arrange for yet another election and for other
appropriate temporary reapportionment relief. The very great difficulties implicit in affording any such relief at this late stage go to
the question of its desirability, not-to the mootness of the underlying
action.
