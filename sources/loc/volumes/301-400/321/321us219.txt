ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 115.

Argued January 12, 1944.-Decided February 14, 1944.

1. Where a personal holding company, for the years 1934, 1935 and

1936, failed to make and file a separate return on Form 1120H, as
required by applicable and valid Treasury Regulations, in respect
of the surtax imposed on personal holding companies by Title IA
of the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936, held that assessment of the
tax may be made at any time, notwithstanding that the corporation
made and filed for each year a return on Form 1120 in respect of
the ordinary income tax imposed by Title I of the Acts. P. 222.
The filing of the ordinary income-tax returns, in which the corporation erroneously denied that it was a personal holding company, did not start the statute of limitations running against
assessment of the surtax.
2. Under the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1935, imposition of the penalty for failure to file a return (as distinguished from tardily
filing) is mandatory; but under the Revenue Act of 1936 the taxpayer may be relieved of the penalty where the failure to file was
"due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect." P. 224.
134 F. 2d 977, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 320 U. S. 724, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 43 B. T. A. 463,
which sustained the Commissioner's determination of
deficiencies in personal-holding-company surtax and
penalties.

OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
Opinion of the Court.

321 U.S.

AIR. JusTIcm JACKiSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Lane-Wells Company is a transferee and successor
of the taxpayer Technicraft Engineering Corporation
and as such is liable for its taxes. The Commissioner,
the Board of Tax Appeals,' and the Circuit Court of Appeals 2 have held that Technicraft was a personal holding
company in 1934, 1935, and 1936, and that question is no
longer open.
For the years named, Technicraft filed the usual corporation income tax returns on Treasury Form 1120. On
this form the following appeared: "Is the corporation a
personal holding company within the meaning of Section
351 of the Revenue Act of 1934 [or the appropriate year] ?
(If so, an additional return on Form 1120H must be
filed.)" To this each year Technicraft answered, "No."
In none of the years in question did it file a personal holding company return on Form 1120H. It was advised,
and in good faith believed, that it was not a personal holding company within the meaning of the Act.
The Commissioner relies upon the taxpayer's alleged default in two respects. First, the deficiency notices were
given within three years of the filing of the corporate return on Form 1120 for the year 1936, but not within three
years of such returns for 1934 and 1935 and not within
four years (the period as to a transferee) of the 1934 return. Hence, a part of the tax is barred by the statute
of limitations if the return filed is the only one required to
start the statute. Second, the Commissioner has assessed
and the Board has upheld as to each year a 25 per cent
penalty for failure to file the personal holding company
return.

Opinion of the Court.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed
the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals. It held the one
return sufficient to start the running of the limitation
statute as to both income taxes and personal holding company taxes and held that there was no default warrant-

ing imposition of the penalty. This decision conflicted
with that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in Simpson & Co. v. Helvering, 128 F. 2d 742, and we
granted certiorari.
Prior to 1934, as now, personal holding companies were
liable for the regular corporation income taxes under Title
I of the Revenue Acts and they, like all other corporations, were subject to additional tax upon an accumulation of profits where there was present a purpose of
avoiding surtaxes upon shareholders.3 The obscurity of
corporate taxpayers' purposes and difficulties of proof
made the latter tax something of a dead letter in practice,
and a new tax was devised "to provide for a tax which will
be automatically levied upon the holding company without any necessity for proving a purpose of avoiding surtaxes."' The new tax was included in a separate title of
the Revenue Act of 1934, Title IA-Additional Income
Taxes, and constituted § 351, entitled Surtax on Personal
Holding Companies. As part (c) thereof it enacted that
administrative provisions, including penalties, applicable in respect of the taxes imposed by Title I should apply
in respect of the tax imposed by this section.' It seems

insofar as not inconsistent with this section, be applicable in respect
of the tax imposed by this section, except that the provisions of section
131 of that title shall not be applicable." 48 Stat. 752.

clear that this section created a new tax separate from
that on income of ordinary corporations.
Among the administrative provisions of Title I incorporated by reference in the personal holding company tax
section are § 54 (a),' which requires one liable for such tax
to "make such returns, and comply with such rules and
regulations, as the Commissioner, with the approval of
the Secretary, may from time to time prescribe," and § 62,
which directs the Commissioner to prescribe and publish
"all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of
this title." " Pursuant thereto Treasury Regulations were
promulgated providing unequivocally: "A separate return
is required for the surtax imposed under section 351. Such
return shall be made on Form 1120H." I
The taxpayer has not complied with this regulation.
It says, however, that its regular corporation income tax
return must be taken as an equivalent to the separate
return, under our decision in Germantown Trust Co. v.
Commissioner, 309 U. S. 304, both for starting the period
of limitation and for avoiding the penalty. The taxpayer
in the Germantown case filed a return on a wrong form.
The return contained, however, "all of the data from which
a tax could be computed and assessed although it did not
purport to state any amount due as tax," and the Court
said, "this defect falls short of rendering it no return
whatever." 309 U. S. at 308, 310. There the only liability involved was for a Title I income tax, and the return
8 § 54 (a) provides: "Every person liable to any tax imposed by
this title or for the collection thereof, shall keep such records, render
under oath such statements, make such returns, and comply with
such rules and regulations, as the Commissioner, with the approval of
the Secretary, may from time to time prescribe." 48 Stat. 698.

for the enforcement of this title." 48 Stat. 700.

was addressed to that liability, as to which the court held
that it set the statute of limitations running. Here the
taxpayer is under liabilities for two taxes and under an
obligation to file two returns, and it says that one return
addressed to but one of the liabilities answers the purpose

of both.
It is contended by the Government that the returns in
the present case were insufficient to advise the Commissioner that any liability existed for the holding-company
tax. The Board of Tax Appeals found that the returns
filed by the corporation disclosed its gross income and
deductions and its resulting net income. 43 B. T. A. 470,
471. The Circuit Court of Appeals construed this as finding that they "showed all the facts necessary for the respondent to compute the taxes as a personal holding company obligation." 134 F. 2d at 978. But it seems admitted that the returns did not show the facts on which liability would be predicated. Such liability was expressly
denied by the return, and to obtain data on which corporations subject to the tax could be identified and assessed was the very purpose of requiring a separate return
addressed to that liability. Taxpayer says that the information called for by Form 1120H is information that could
have been called for by Form 1120. We assume so, but
we do not see how the fact helps the taxpayer, for the
Treasury was fully within the statute in requiring that
information in a separate return.
Congress has given discretion to the Commissioner to
prescribe by regulation forms of returns and has made it
the duty of the taxpayer to comply. It thus implements
the system of self-assessment which is so largely the basis
of our American scheme of income taxation. The purpose is not alone to get tax information in some form but
also to get it with such uniformity, completeness, and arrangement that the physical task of handling and verifying returns may be readily accomplished. For such

purposes the regulation requiring two separate returns for
these taxes was a reasonable and valid one and the finding
of the Board of Tax Appeals that the taxpayer is in default
is correct.
Since no personal holding company returns were filed,
the statute of limitations did not commence to run,9 and
the assessment of the tax was not barred."
Since the taxpayer defaulted in filing a required return
for the years 1934 and 1935, the 25 per cent penalty in the
applicable acts became mandatory 1 and was correctly
upheld by the Board of Tax Appeals.
For 1936 the penalty presents a different question.
The statute applicable provides that it could be lifted if
9The statute provides: "In the case of a false or fraudulent return
with intent to evade tax or of a failure to file a return the tax may be
assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may
be begun without assessment, at any time." § 276 (a), 48 Stat. 745.
10 The Treasury Regulation also provided: "The same provisions
of law relating to the period of limitation for assessment and collection which govern the taxes imposed by Title I also apply to the surtax imposed under Title IA. However, since the surtax imposed under Title IA is a distinct and separate tax from those imposed under
Title I, the making of a return under Title I will not start the period
of limitation for assessment of the surtax imposed under Title IA.
If the corporation subject to section 351 fails to make a return, the tax
may be assessed at any time." Regulations 86, Art. 351-8.
The Court of Appeals thought this unauthorized. As we have
indicated, we do not agree that it was beyond the delegated authority,
and it appears only to declare what was even otherwise the law.
11 The 1934 statute reads: "In case of any failure to make and file
a return required by this title, within the time prescribed by law or
prescribed by the Commissioner in pursuance of law, 25 per centum
of the tax shall be added to the tax, except that when a return is filed
after such time and it is shown that the failure to file it was due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect no such addition shall
be made to the tax." § 291, 48 Stat. 746. A 25 per cent penalty is
likewise mandatory in this case under § 406 of the Revenue Act of
1935, 49 Stat. 1014. This provision excuses late filing, for reasonable
cause, but not complete failure to file.

it were shown that such failure was "due to reasonable
cause and not due to willful neglect." Revenue Act of
1936, § 291, 49 Stat. 1727. The Board has made no finding on that subject, apparently assuming that the mandatory provisions applied to all years. The question is one
of fact in the first instance for the Board's determination.
Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489. The Government does not object to a remand to the Board for the limited purpose of reconsidering the imposition of the 25 per
cent penalty for the year 1936 only, if the respondent shall
seasonably apply to the Board therefor. In all things
else the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the cause remanded with directions to remand to the Tax
Court for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
