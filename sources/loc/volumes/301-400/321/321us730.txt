DECISIONS PER CURIAM, ETC., FROM JANUARY
11, 1944, THROUGH APRIL 10, 1944.*
Certiorari, 320 U. S. 723, to the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit. Argued January 5, 6, 1944. Decided
January 17, 1944. Per Curiam:Judgment affirmed by an
equally divided Court. MR. JUSTICE JACKSON states that,
the proceeding having been commenced, as the record
shows, "under the instructions of the Attorney General"
and the valuation for which the Government now contends
appearing to have been fixed at the time when he held that
office, he thinks it inappropriate that he should now participate in the determination of the case, notwithstanding
he has no recollection of personal participation in the Departmental action. Assistant Attorney General Littell,
with whom Solicitor General Fahy and Messrs. Vernon L.
Wilkinson and Roger P. Marquis were on the brief, for the
United States. Mr. Herman Phleger, with whom Mr.
A. G. M. Robertson was on the brief, for respondents.

states: "I dissent. As this record stands, railroad service
to Yonkers has been abandoned without any valid order
authorizing such action. I therefore would permit the
Court's mandate to go down. But if the mandate is to be
stayed, I think that, at the very least, since the stay is
equivalent to an injunction, a bond should be required of
the railroad in an amount sufficient to protect the people
of Yonkers against such loss as the city or its citizens may
sustain in case it is ultimately decided that the railroad
had no legal right to abandon its service. Cf. Inland
Steel Co. v. United States, 306 U. S. 153, 156-157." MR.

No. 146. UNITED STATES v. SPITz. February 28,1944.
On respondents' petition for clarification of the opinion of
the Court, it is ordered that the two paragraphs beginning
on page 10 of the slip opinion be amended to read as
follows:
"As to Sundays and holidays, we construe the statute to
require extra compensation for inspectors without regard
to the hours of the day or whether such services are additional to a regular weekly tour of duty. Before § 5 there
was no authority to pay extra compensation for Sunday
and holiday work. Revised Statutes, § 2871, allowed extra pay for nighttime work only. Somewhat indirectly
the Act of February 13, 1911, gave Sunday and holiday
pay and the 1920 amendment made the right to that extra
compensation clear by saying extra compensation shall be
paid inspectors 'who may be required to remain on duty
between the hours of five o'clock postmeridian and eight
o'clock antemeridian, or on Sundays or holidays'. This
language and the Customs Regulations, note 18, supra,
give an employee who works regular hours weekdays in
daytime extra pay for Sunday and holiday work. The
statute covers also those who work outside the statutory
normal hours. Logically, if Sundays and holidays were
not to receive extra compensation, without regard to
whether services on those days were overtime, there would
have been no occasion to add Sundays and holidays to the
overtime. Overtime would cover every situation.
"The proviso of § 5 does not give the Collector of Customs authority to make assignments which deprive inspectors of the Sunday and holiday pay. It authorizes adjustments of hours but specifically forbids alteration of
overtime pay. It is silent as to Sundays and holidays

OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
321 U. S.

751

Decisions Per Curiam, Etc.

which leaves the earlier grant of extra compensation for
those days in effect. Overtime pay is also applicable to
Sundays and holidays when inspectors work longer than
nine hours with one hour for food and rest. The -ate of
overtime extra compensation on Sundays and holidays is
the same as the rate for week days. The administrative
practice is uncertain. It does not support a contrary conclusion. The Government cites excerpts from testimony
on amendatory bills, not here directly involved, which indicate the extra compensation is paid for Sundays and holidays.22 Findings 5 and 6 of the Court of Claims, note 17,
supra,show that extra compensation was paid at times for
Sunday and holiday services."'
