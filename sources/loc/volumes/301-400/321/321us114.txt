OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
Opinion of the Court.

321 U. S.

EX PARTE HAWK.
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS.

No. -.

Decided January 31, 1944.

1. Since it does not appear that the applicant for habeas corpus,
confined under sentence of a state court, has exhausted his remedies
under the state law, the application is denied without prejudice.
P. 118.
2. Where resort to state court remedies has failed to afford to a
petitioner for habeas corpus a full and fair adjudication of the
federal questions raised, either because the State affords no remedy,
or because in the particular case the remedy afforded proves in
practice unavailable or seriously inadequate, a federal court should
entertain the petition; but in such case the petitioner should proceed
in the federal district court before resorting to this Court. P. 118.
3. The statement often made that federal courts will interfere with
the administration of justice in the state courts only "in rare cases
where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to
exist" is inapplicable where the petitioner for habeas corpus has
exhausted his state remedies and makes a substantial showing of
denial of federal right. P. 117.
Application denied.

PER URL&M.
This case comes here on petitioner's application for
leave to file in this Court his petition for writ of habeas
corpus. Petitioner is confined in the Nebraska State Penitentiary under sentence for murder imposed by the Nebraska District Court.
His present proceeding has been prefaced by several
earlier applications to both state and federal courts. His
petition for habeas corpus was denied without a hearing

by the Nebraska District Court whose decision was affirmed
by the Nebraska Supreme Court, Hawk v. O'Grady, 137
Neb. 639, 290 N. W. 911. This Court denied certiorari,
311 U. S. 645. Petitioner then filed in the United States
District Court for Nebraska a petition for habeas corpus,
alleging matters not previously brought to the attention
of the state courts. This application was denied without
a hearing, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit affirmed on the ground that petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies, Hawk v. Olson, 130 F. 2d 910.
We denied certiorari. 317 U. S. 697. Petitioner then
urged his present contentions upon the Nebraska Supreme
Court in a petition for writ of habeas corpus which that
court denied without opinion. We denied his petition
for habeas corpus upon like allegations but without prejudice to presentation of the matters alleged to the United
States District Court, Ex parte Hawk, 318 U. S. 746.
Petitioner accordingly renewed his petition for writ of
habeas corpus to the United States District Court for
Nebraska and filed a like petition with the senior Circuit
Judge for the Eighth Circuit; both petitions have been
denied, and leave to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has been denied by the senior
Circuit Judge of that circuit. Petitioner thereupon filed
the present application in this Court.
In the application now before us, and in those filed with
the United States District Court and the senior Circuit
Judge of the Eighth Circuit, petitioner alleges, among
other things, that the state court forced him into trial for a
capital offense, Neb. Comp. Stat. ยง 28-401, with such expedition as to deprive him of the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45; see Smith v.
O'Grady, 312 U. S. 329; compare Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S.
455, and that his conviction was based in part on the intro-

duction at the trial of evidence known by the prosecution
to be perjured, Mooney v. Holohan,294 U. S. 103.
From our examination of the papers presented to us we
cannot say that he is not entitled to a hearing on these contentions, Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 284-7; Holiday v. Johnston,313 U. S. 342,350; Waley v. Johnston,316
U. S. 101, 104-5; Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U. S. 255, 258.
But, as was pointed out by the District Court and Circuit
Judge, petitioner has not yet shown that he has exhausted
the remedies available to him in the state courts, and he
is therefore not at this time entitled to relief in a federal
court or by a federal judge.
So far as appears, petitioner's present contentions have
been presented to the state courts only in an application for
habeas corpus filed in the Nebraska Supreme Court, which
it denied without opinion. From other opinions of that
court it appears that it does not usually entertain original
petitions for habeas corpus, but remits the petitioner to an
application to the appropriate district court of the state,
from whose decision an appeal lies to the state Supreme
Court, Williamsv. Olson, 143 Neb. 115, 8 N. W. 2d 830,831;
see In re White, 33 Neb. 812, 814-15, 51 N. W. 287. From
that court the cause may be brought here for review if an
appropriate federal question is properly presented.
Of this remedy in the state court petitioner has not
availed himself. Moreover, Nebraska recognizes and employs the common law writ of error coram nobis which, in
circumstances in which habeas corpus will not lie, may be
issued by the trial court as a remedy for infringement of
constitutional right of the defendant in the course of the
trial, Carlsen v. State, 129 Neb. 84, 94-8, 261 N. W. 339.
Until that remedy has been sought without avail we
cannot say that petitioner's state remedies have been
exhausted.
Ordinarily an application for habeas corpus by one detained under a state court judgment of conviction for

crime will be entertained by a federal court only after all
state remedies available, including all appellate remedies
in the state courts and in this Court by appeal or writ of
certiorari, have been exhausted. Tinsley v. Anderson, 171
U. S. 101, 104-5; Urquhart v. Brown, 205 U. S. 179;
United States ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler, 269 U. S. 13;
Mooney v. Holohan, supra, 115; Ex parte Abernathy, 320
U. S. 219. And where those remedies have been exhausted
this Court will not ordinarily entertain an application for
the writ before it has been sought and denied in a district
court or denied by a circuit or district judge. Ex parte
Hawk, supra; Ex parte Abernathy, supra.
The denial of relief to petitioner by the federal courts
and judges in this, as in a number of other cases, appears
to have been on the ground that it is a principle controlling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts, that
those courts will interfere with the administration of justice in the state courts only "in rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to
exist." See In re Anderson, 117 F. 2d 939, 940; In re Miller, 126 F. 2d 826, 827; Kelly v. Ragen, 129 F. 2d 811,
814-15; Hawk v. Olson, supra,911-13; Marsinov. Hogsett,
37 F. 2d 409, 414; UnitedStates ex rel. Foley v. Ragen, 52
F. Supp. 265, 269-270; cf. United States ex rel. Murphy v.
Murphy, 108 F. 2d 861, 862. To this, some courts have
added the intimation that when the writ is sought by one
held under a state conviction the only remedy ordinarily
to be had in a federal court is by way of application to
this Court. Ex parte Jefferson, 106 F. 2d 471, 472; Kramer v. Nevada, 122 F. 2d 417, 419; In re Miller, supra;
Hawk v. Olson, supra, 913; cf. Kelly v. Ragen, supra,
814.
The statement that the writ is available in the federal
courts only "in rare cases" presenting "exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency," often quoted from the opinion of this Court in UnitedStates ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler,

supra, 17, was made in a case in which the petitioner had
not exhausted his state remedies and is inapplicable to
one in which the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies, and in which he makes a substantial showing of a
denial of federal right.
Where the state courts have considered and adjudicated
the merits of his contentions, and this Court has either
reviewed or declined to review the state court's decision,
a federal court will not ordinarily re-examine upon writ of
habeas corpus the questions thus adjudicated. Salinger
v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 230-32. But where resort to state
court remedies has failed to afford a full and fair adjudication of the federal contentions raised, either because the
state affords no remedy, see Mooney v. Holohan, supra,
115, or because in the particular case the remedy afforded
by state law proves in practice unavailable or seriously
inadequate, cf. Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86; Ex parte
Davis, 318 U. S. 412, a federal court should entertain his
petition for habeas corpus, else he would be remediless.
In such a case he should proceed in the federal district
court before resorting to this Court by petition for habeas
corpus.
As petitioner does not appear to have exhausted his
state remedies his application will be denied without
prejudice to his resort to the procedure indicated as appropriate by this opinion.
Application denied.
