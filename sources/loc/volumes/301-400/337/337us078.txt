Under 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a), incorporated in the revision of the
Judicial Code effective September 1, 1948,,the doctrine of forum
non conveniens is made applicable to civil suits by the Government
against corporations under the antitrust laws. Ex'parte Collett,

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The issue here is whether the 1948 revision of the
Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) extends the
doctrine of forum non conveniens to antitrust suits. The
Government's complaint in this civil suit alleged that
respondent corporations have conspired to obtain control
of local transportation companies in at least 44 cities in
16 states in different sections of the country, in order to
restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in busses
and the petroleum and other supplies incident thereto, in
violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209,
15 U. S. C. §§ 1, 2.
This is the second time that an order of the court
below, the. United States District Court for the Southern
District of California, attempting to effectuate a transfer
of the case from Los Angeles to Chicago, has been before
this Court. When respondents' motion was first granted,
the District Court dismissed the action, 7 F. R. D. 456
.(1947), inasmuch as the federal courts. then lacked statutory power to transfer cases. We reversed, holding that

forum non conveniens was not applicable in antitrust
suits. United States v. National City Lines, 334 U. S.
573 (June 7, 1948). Afte'r September 1, 1948, the effective date of the present Judicial Code,' respondents filed
a new motion under the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
citing § 1404 (a), .which reads as follows: "For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of
justice, a dis*trict court may transfer any civil action to
any other district or division where it might have been
brought." Again the District Court below granted the
motion. It ordered the case transferred. 80 F. Supp.
734 (1948). The Government thereupon submitted in
this Court a motion for leave to file petition for writ of
certiorari. We assigned the case for hearing on this motion. 335 U. S. 897 (1948).
In taking the position that the District Court lacked
authority to enter its order of transfer, the Government
has advanced many of the arguments which we have already considered today-and rejected-in Ex parte Collett, ante, p. 55, and Kilpatrick v. Texas & Pacific R.
Co., ante, p. 75, in which we held that actions under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act were now subject to the
doctrine of forum non conveniens. The Government contends, for example, that Congress intended § 1404 (a) to
apply only to actions the venue provisions of which were
formerly contained in Title 28, rather than to "any civil
action" (the venue requirements in antitrust cases. are
defined in 15 U. S. C. § 22; in Liability Act cases, 45
U. S. C. § 56); and that the legislative history establishes
very clearly that Congress had no desire substantially to
Act of June -25, 1948, 62 Stat. 869, 992, § 38.
There has been apparently but one other reported case dealing
witlh the instant issue. It is in accord with the holding below. United
States v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 83 F. Supp. 233 (1949).

New Discretionary Transfer Provision, 58 Yale L. J. 482 (1949).

change the law-indeed, the Government urges us to disregard the reviser's notes which were printed in the House
Reports.2 We cannot accept this position for the reasons
discussed in our previous decisions today. The reviser's
notes are so obviously authoritative in perceiving the
meaning of the Code that the Government itself, in discussing a section other than § 1404 (a), refers to them in
its brief in this case. And we have already had occasion
to look to the reviser's notes. Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke
Lok Po, 336 U. S. 368, 376, n. 12 (1949).
It is true that the reviser's notes to § 1404 (a), although citing a Federal Employers' Liability Act decision,
make no reference to the antitrust laws or to our previous
decision in this litigation. The Government therefore
urges that our disposition of the Liability Act cases is
not conclusive. We disagree. The notes cite the Liability Act decision "As an example of the need of such
a provision." Obviously, an example is not a complete
catalogue. The use of an example implies no purpose
to restrict the meaning of the statutory phrase "any civil
action" precisely to the illustration selected. Quite the
contrary, the particular example noted demonstrates that
Congress intended to effectuate changes in the law, ir
order to expand the transferability of cases. And the
2 The note to § 1404 (a) appears at H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th
Cong., 1st Sess. A132 (1947) and H. R. Rep. No. 2646, 79th Cong.,
2d Sess. A127 (1946). It reads as follows: "Subsection (a) was
drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the
venue is proper. 'As an example of the need of such a provision, see
Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, 62 S. Ct. 6, 314 U. S. 44,
86 L. Ed. 28, which was prosecuted under the Federal Employer's
[sic] Liability Act in New York, although the accident occurred andthe employee resided in Ohio. The new subsection requires the court
to determine that -he transfer is necessary for convenience of the
parties and witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justiceto do so"

change in antitrust practice seems no more radical than
the change in Federal Employers' Liability Act practice:
Baltimore & 0. R. Co. v. Kepner, 314 U. S. 44 (1941),cited in the reviser's note, was decided over six years be'fore our initial decision in this case, 334 U. S. 573 (1948),
which was the first ruling by this Court that forum non
conveniens was inapplicable in antitrust suits.
Although no explanation is needed for the lack of
Congressional reference to our former decision, simple
chronology may be consulted. The reviser's notes appeared in House Report No. 308, 80th Congress, 1st Sess.,
which was published in April, 1947. The Code revision
was initially passed by the House in July, 1947
With
amendments the revision was passed by the Senate on
June 12, 1948,' and by the House on June 16, 1948.'
Our decision in the first National City Linew case, 334
U. S. 573, was handed down on June 7, 1948. Clearly,
the failure of Congress expressly to consider this decision
proves nothing.
Nor was there anything in our decision which required
unique Congressional discussion, in the face of the unmistakable statutory. language and reviser's notes. We expressly held that "Congress' mandate regarding venue
and the exercise of jurisdiction is binding upon the federal
courts," 334 'U. S. at 588-89, and that decision in this
field must rest on "the legislative purpose and the effect
of the language used . . .," supra, -at 507. Nothing in
our previous opinion intimates that we could fail to
respect whatever modification of the law Congress might
enaot.
Moreover, this change in the law must have been
known to the Government in time for it to have addressed

the protests which we have heard to the Congress. This
was admitted on the oral argument; it could not possibly
have been denied. When this litigation was previously
before us, National City's brief, at pp. 25-26 and 45,
expressly called attention to the imminent probability
that § 1404 (a) would be enacted and would be held
applicabl, to antitrust suits. This brief was filed here
on April 26. 1948. Not until June 7, 1948, was the final
hearing on the Judicial Code revision held before the
Senate Judiciary Subcommittee. Furthermore, the Code
proposals were extensively publicized. See Ex parte Collett, ante, at pp. 67-68. The Department of Justice in
particular was informed: each United States Attorney received a copy of the drafts; 6 a Department spokesman
testified at the House hearing; " the Attorney General
was asked for an opinion by the Congressional Committee. 8 The plain inference is either that the Government

letter declares that the objectives of the revision are "commendable
and desirable," and continues as follows: "You will remember the
discussions between members of the staff of the committee and of
the Department last month at which the Department made some
suggestions with reference to minor corrections of errors and omissions then in the draft of the bill being considered by your committee.
"I am advised that this conference agreed upon a number of corrections. and changes and that these corrections and changes have
now been incorporated in the bill with the one exception of the

took no action with respect to the forthcoming alteration
of the rule that forum non conveniens was inapplicable
to antitrust suits, or that a protest was made which Congress disregarded. Neither alternative would offer the
slightest justification for overriding the unequivocal words
of § 1404 (a) and the legislative history which establishes
that Congress indeed meant what it said.
For these reasons, we can find no distinction between
this case and the others decided today. We hold that
§ 1404 (a) is applicable here. The motion is
Denied.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK

concurs, dissenting.
There are difficulties for me however the case is decided. But I have concluded that the fairer result is
reached if the ambiguities and doubts, fully canvassed
and disclosed in the Court's opinions in this case and in
Ex parte Collett, ante, p. 55, decided this day, are resolved by reading § 1404 (a) as making the doctrine of
forum non conveniens applicable to any civil action as to
which the venue provisions are codified in revised Title 28.
That gives full effect to the words "any civil action" in the
field in which Congress was legislating. And it authorizes, as respects that group of cases, a transfer to another
district in lieu of outright dismissal as had previously obtained. That construction saves § 1404 (a), the venue
.provisions of the Clayton Act and our decision in United
States v. National City Lines, Inc., 334 U. S. 573, from
mutilation. I am reluctant to conclude that Congress
took the more drastic course in a mere revision of the
code. So to hold would make a basic change not only in
