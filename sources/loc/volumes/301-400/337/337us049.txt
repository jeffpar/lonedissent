NO. 388.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued March 2, 1949.-Decided May 16, 1949.
1. That a person was a member of the armed forces at the time of
the accident does not prevent recovery of a judgment against the
United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act for his death
or injury (not incident to his services in the armed forces) resulting
from the negligence of an employee of the Government. Pp. 50-53.
2. This does not necessarily mean that the amount payable under
servicemen's benefit laws should not be deducted, or taken into
consideration, when a serviceman obtains a judgment against the
Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Pp. 53-54.
169 F. 2d 840, reversed.

Opinion of the Court.

337 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 60 Stat. 842, 28 U. S. C. (1946 ed.)
§ 931, now 28 U. S. C. § 2674. The question is whether
members of the United States armed forces can recover
under that Act for injuries not incident to their service.
The District Court for the Western District of North
Carolina entered judgment against the Government, rendering an unreported opinion, but the Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit reversed, in a divided decision.
169 F. 2d 840. We brought the case here on'certiorari
because of its importance as an interpretation of the Act.
335 U. S.901.
The facts are these. Welker Brooks, Arthur Brooks,
and their father, James Brooks, were riding in their automobile along a public highway in North Carolina on a
dark, rainy night in February, 1945. Arthur was driving. He came to a full stop before entering an intersection, and proceeded across the nearer lane of the intersecting road. Seconds later the car was struck from the
left by a United States Army truck, driven by a civilian
employee of the Army. Arthur Brooks was killed;
Welker and his father were badly injured.
Welker and the administrator of Arthur's estate
br~ught actions against-the United States in the District
Court. The District Judge tried the causes without a
jury and found negligence on the part of the truck driver.
The Government moved to dismiss on the ground that
Welker and his deceased brother were in the armed forces
of the'United States at the time of the accident, and
were therefore barred from recovery. The Court denied
the motion, entered a $25,425 judgment for the decedent's
estate, and a $4,000 judgment for Welker.' On appeal,
'James Brooks, the father, also recovered judgment in his own
right. The Government does not contest his recovery.

Opinion of the Court.

however, the Government's argument persuaded the
Court of Appeals to reverse the judgment, Judge Parker
dissenting.
We agree with Judge Parker. The statute's terms are
clear. They provide for District Court jurisdiction over
any claim founded on negligence brought against the
United States. We are not persuaded that "any claim"
means "any claim but that of servicemen." The statute
does contain twelve exceptions. § 421. None exclude
petitioners' claims. One is for claims arising in a foreign country. A second excludes claims arising out
of combatant activities of the military or naval forces,
or the Coast Guard, during time of war. These and
other exceptions are too lengthy, specific, and close to
the present problem to take away petitioners' judgments.
Without resorting to an automatic maxim of construction, such exceptions make it clear to us that Congress
knew what it was about when it used the term "any
claim." It would be absurd to believe that Congress did
not have the servicemen in mind in 1946, when this
statute was passed. The overseas and combatant activities exceptions make this plain.
More than the language and framework of the act support this view. There were eighteen' tort claims bills
introduced in Congress between 1925 and 1935.2 All but

two ' contained exceptions denying recovery to members
of the.armed forces. When the present Tort Claims Act

was first introduced, the exception concerning servicemen
had been dropped.' What remained from previous bills
was an exclusion of all claims for which compensation was
provided by the World War Veterans' Act of 1924-43
Stat. 607, 38 U. S. C. § 421, compensation for injury or
death occurring in the first World War. H. R. 181, 79th
Cong., 1st Sess. When H. R. 181 was incorporated into
the Legislative Reorganization Act, the last vestige of
the exclusion for members of the armed forces disappeared. See also Note, 1 Syracuse L. Rev. 87, 93-94.
The Government envisages dire consequences should
we reverse the judgment.' A battle commander's poor
judgment, an army surgeon's slip of hand, a defective
jeep which causes injury, all would ground tort actions
against the United States. But we are dealing with an
accident which had nothing to do with the Brooks' army
careers, injuries not caused by their service except in the
sense that all human events depend upon what has already transpired. Were the accident incident to the
Brooks' service, a wholly different case would be presented. We express no opinion as to it, but we may note
that only in its context do Dobson v. United States, 27
F. 2d 807, Bradey v. United States, 151 F. 2d 742, and
Jefferson v. United States, 77 F. Supp. 706, have any
relevance. See the similar distinction in 31 U. S. C.
§ 223b. Interpretation of the same words may vary,
of course, with the consequences, for those consequences
may provide insight for determination of congressional
purpose. Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit & Steamship Co.,
'Other bills after those mentioned in note 2, above, also omitted
this exception. See, e. g., H. R. 5373, 77th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R.
1356, 78th Cong., ist Sess. This has nothing to do with "congressional awareness" of the Dobson and Bradey decisions, infra. The
present Tort Claims Act contains exceptions which would have been
specifically covered by those cases. § 421 (d).
5 The Government's other arguments on this phase of the case are
sleeveless. They will not be discussed.

Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S. 198. The Government's fears may have point
in reflecting congressional purpose to leave injuries incident to service where they were, despite literal language
and other considerations to the contrary. The result
may be so outlandish that even the factors we have
mentioned would not permit recovery. But that is not
the case before us.'
Provisions in other statutes for disability payments to
servicemen, and gratuity payments to their survivors, 38
U. S. C. § 701, indicate no purpose to forbid tort actions
under the Tort Claims Act. Unlike the usual workman's compensation statute, e. g., 33 U. S. C. § 905, there
is nothing. in the Tort Claims Act or the veterans' laws
which provides for exclusiveness of remedy. United
States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301, indicates that,
so far as third party liability is concerned. Nor did Congress provide for an election of remedies, as in the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U. S. C. § 757.
Thus Dahn v. Davis, 258 U. S.421, and cases following
that decision, are not in point. Compare Parrv. United
States, 172 F. 2d 462. We will not call either remedy in
the present case exclusive, nor pronounce a doctrine of
election of remedies, when Congress has not done so.
Compare 31 U. S. C. § 224b, specifically repealed by the
Tort Claims Act, § 424 (a). In the very Act we are construing, Congress provided for exclusiveness of the remedy
in three instances, §§ 403 (d), 410 (b), and 423, and.
omitted any provision which would govern this case.
But this does not mean that the amount payable under
servicemen's benefit laws should not be deducted, or taken
into consideration, when the serviceman obtains judgment under the Tort Claims Act. Without the benefit of
argument in this Court, or discussion of the matter in the
Court of Appeals, we now see no indication that Congress
meant the United States to pay twice for the same injury.
Certain elements of tort damages may be the equivalent
of elements taken into account in providing disability

payments. It would seem incongruous, at first glance,
if the United States should have to pay in tort for hospital expenses it had already paid, for example. And
whatever the legal theory behind a wrongful death action,
the same considerations might apply to the Government's
gratuity death payment to Arthur Brooks' survivors, although national service life insurance might be considered
a separate transaction, unrelated to an action in tort or
other benefits.
. But the statutory scheme and the Veterans' Administration regulations may dictate a contrary result. The
point was not argued in the case as it came to us from
the Court of Appeals. The court below does not appear
to have passed upon it; it was unnecessary, in the view
they took of the case. We do not know from this record
whether the Government objected to this portion of the
District Court judgment-nor can we tell from this record
whether the Court of Appeals should consider a general
objection to the judgment sufficient to allow it to consider
this problem. Finally, we are not sure how much deducting the District Judge did. It is obvious that we
are in no position to pass upon the question of deducting
other benefits in the case's present posture.
We conclude that the language, framework and' legislative history of the Tort Claims Act require a holding
that petitioners' actions were well founded. But we remand to tle Court of Appeals for its consideration of the
problem of reducing damages pro tanto, sliould it decide
that such consideration is proper in view of the District
Court judgment and the parties' allegations of error.
Reversed and remanded.
