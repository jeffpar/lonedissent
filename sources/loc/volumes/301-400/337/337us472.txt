GENERAL, AS SUCCESSOR TO THE ALIEN

PROPERTY CUSTODIAN,

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 390.

Argued March 28-29, 1949.-Decided June 20, 1949.

Pursuant to § 5 (b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended,
the President promulgated Executive Order No. 8389 prohibiting
certain transactions in property of nationals of certain foreign
countries except when licensed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Two days before this was made applicable to Austria by Executive
Order No. 8785, petitioner was designated by a New York court
as temporary receiver of the assets of an Austrian national (AKM).
-The asset was a debt owed by the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and no license permitting its
transfer was issued. After issuance of Executive Order No. 8785,
petitioner was designated permanent receiver. Subsequently, the
Alien Property Custodian issued an order vesting in himself title
to the claim of AKM against ASCAP. Held: In a suit by the
Custodian against petitioner and ASCAP, judgments were properly
entered declaring that petitioner had no right, title or interest
'inthe claim and directing ASCAP to pay it to the 'Custodian.
Pp. 474-493.
1. The Joint Resolution of May 7, 1940, amending § 5 (b) of
the Trading with the 'Enemy Act, and Executive Order No. 8389,
issued April 10, 1940, put into effect a valid plan for control of
the property covered by the Executive Order that prohibited any
change of title to the property here involved by reason of the
subsequent appointment of petitioner as permanent receiver. Pp.
476-486.
(a) The Joint Resolution of May 7, 940, ratified Executive
Order No- 8389, issued April 10, 1940, including the broad definition of "banking institution" as including "any person holding
credits for others as a direct or incidental part of his business."
Pp. 478-479.
(b) Not being defined, the term "credit," as used in the
Trading with the Enemy Act, the Executive Orders and the regulations thereunder, is given its ordinary meaning of the obligation
due on accounting between parties to transactions. P. 480.

Statement of the Case.

(c) Petitioner and ASCAP are "banking institutions" within
the meaning of the definitions of that term in the Executive Orders
and the prohibition against "transfers of credit between any banking institutions." Pp. 480-482.
(d) A transfer of the credit here involved from a liability
owed by ASCAP to AKM to a liability owed by ASCAP to petitioner would violate the prohibition against "transfers of credit"
P. 482.
(e) Although title to the claim in question- had not been
vested in the Custodian when petitioner was appointed permanent
receiver, the Executive Orders prevented title from being transferred to petitioner, even by judicial action. Pp. 482-485.
(f) A different result is not required by the administrative
interpretation of the Executive Orders. Pp. 485-486.
2. Under § 977-b of the New York Civil Practice Act, title to
the claim did not pass to petitioner by virtue of his appointment
as temporary receiver before issuance of Executive Order No. 8785.
Pp. 486-492.
(a) Although the state statute is susceptible of varying interpretations and the point has not been ruled upon by the state
courts, this Court accepts the, reasonable interpretation given to
it by the Federal District Court and Court of Appeals, which
are skilled in the laws of New York. Pp. 486-489.
(b) This Court rejects petitioner's suggestion that a decision
in the federal courts should be delayed until the courts of New
York have settled the issue of state law. Pp. 489-492.
3. The federal courts were not precluded from adjudging the
rights of the respective parties in this case on the ground that
the property was in the hands of the state court by virtue of a
state receivership. Pp. 492-493.
169 F. 2d 324, affirmed.

In a suit by the Alien Property Custodian under § 17
of the Trading with the Enemy Act, a Federal District

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Alien Property Custodian' on April 22, 1946, began
this action under § 17 of the Trading with the Enemy
Act in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York to obtain the payment, and a declaration of title in him as against the petitioner as receiver, of certain royalties owed by the American Society
of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) to
Staatlich Genehmigte Gesellschaft der Autoren, Komponisten und Musikverleger (AKM), an Austrian association, pursuant to the provisions of Vesting Order No. 2097,
Office of Alien Property Custodian, September 4, 1943, 8
Fed. Reg. 16463, whereby the Custodian had vested in
himself title to certain property of AKM, specifically
claims for royalties under copyrights for the performance
of musical compositions. By contract ASCAP had been
authorized by AKM to license on royalty the use in
this country of musical copyrights belonging to AKM.
ASCAP and the petitioner, who is the state-appointed
receiver of the royalties involved, were made defendants.
The District Court, on motiofi for summary judgment or
judgment on the pleadings, entered a judgment declaring

that the petitioner had no right, title or interest in the
claim in question, Markham v. Taylor, 70 F. Supp. 202,
and later, a second judgment directing ASCAP to pay the
debt to the Custodian. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on appeal by the petitioner,2
affirmed. Clark v. Propper, 169 F. 2d 324.
The pertinent facts underlying this controversy are as
follows: On June 12, 1941, on an ex parte application
by a creditor of AKM, the New York Supreme Court
appointed petitioner temporary receiver of that association, pursuant to § 977-b of the New York Civil Practice
Act, which provides for the liquidation of the local assets
of a foreign corporation when it has ceased to do business
for one reason or another not here important. Proceedings under this Act are to enable claimants against the
foreign corporation to secure payment of their claims by
an equitable apportionment of the available assets. The
order of appointment directed him 'to take, receive and
reduce to his possession any and all assets . . . tangible
and intangible, within the State of New York, of the'
defendant [AKM], and hold the same until the further
order of this Court." On June 14, 1941, pursuant to
§ 5 (b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, 40
Stat. 411, 415, as amended,' the President promulgated Executive Order. No. 8785," a so-called "freezing
order," which prohibited certain, transactions involving
Austrian property except as they were specifically licensed
by the Secretary of the Treasury. On July 29, 1941, petitioner, as receiver, began an action in the courts of New

York against ASCAP to recover the royalties which it,
owed AKM.5 Its disposition is awaiting the outcome of
this case. On September 29, 1941, petitioner, upon the
default of AKM, was appointed permanent receiver of
that association's assets. Thereafter followed the vesting order, September 4, 1943, and this suit, April 22, 1946.
Upon the limited grant of the petition for certiorari,
335 U. S. 902, the issues argued before this Court and now
to be decided are whether the appointment of petitioner
as temporary receiver on June 12, 1941, or his appointment as permanent receiver on September 29, 1941, by relation back, passed title to him of the claim for royalties
as of June 12, 1941. Furthermore, since, as will subsequently appear, we conclude these issues against petitioner, we must consider whether the freezing order barred
a subsequent unlicensed judicial transfer by the order
appointing the petitioner permanent receiver.
First. The appointment as permanent receiver on September 29, 1941, concededly would have vested in petitioner as permanent receiver all right, title and-interest of
AKM in its claim against ASCAP if the freezing order of
June 14, 1941, had not intervened after petitioner's appointment as temporary receiver on June 12, 1941.

by brief and at the bar was formally requested by this Court, although
no order to that effect was entered.

PROPPER v. CLARK.
472

Opinion of the Court.

Accepting that position, the question of whether the appointment as permanent receiver related back to the date
of the temporary receivership, so as to place title to the
claim in the permanent receiver as of June 12, 1941, and
the question as to whether the appointment as permanent
receiver itself vested title in the petitioner, notwithstanding the prior freezing order, depend alike upon a determination as to whether the freezing order made invalid
any subsequent transfer of title by judicial action.
The vesting order here in question, Vesting Order No.
2097, 8 Fed. Reg. 16463, was executed on September 4,
1943, a date subsequent.to the appointment of petitioner
as permanent receiver. So far as the parties to this litigation are concerned, by its specific terms it vested in the
Custodian title to-the property of AKM only.7 Nothing
presented. in- this case: calls our attention to any effort
made by the Custodian to vest in himself any title. to the
claim that might be in the permanent receiver for the
benefit of creditors and ultimately for AKM or those entitled to its assets on distribution,8 nor do we adjudicate

his right to do so. The order, so far as pertinent, vested
in the Custodian "All . . . claim [of AKM to] all right
to receive monies . . . by way of royalty, share of profits or other emolument," together with "all causes of
action . . . with respect to" the aforesaid copyrights.
This claim was a debt of ASCAP to AKM, property of
AKM, as defined in the regulations of April 10, 1940,
5 Fed. Reg. 1401 (c), and June 14,1941, 6 Fed. Reg. 2905.
The latter citation refers to the regulation defining property, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, effective
at the time of the vesting order.'
Prior to petitioner's appointment as permanent receiver
and the later vesting order, the President, on June 14,
1941, had prescribed by Executive Order No. 8785, 6 Fed.
Reg. 2897, that certain transactions by or on behalf of
Austrian associations such as AKM were prohibited unless
licensed. No license for the judicial order appointing petitioner as permanent receiver was asked for or obtained.
Order No. 8785 was issued pursuant to the authority
granted the President by § 5 (b) of the Act of October
6, 1917, as amended, particularly by the Joint Resolution of May 7, 1940."' Tb order forbade, § 1A, "All

Opinion of the Court.

or any other period of national emergency to prohibit
such transfers was given the President by the Joint Resolution. Order No. 8785 declared "the existence of a period of unlimited national emergency."
The same Resolution authorized the President to issue
rules and regulations and specifically to define "banking
institutions." The President had on April 10, 1940, issued a similar order prohibiting similar transfers applicable to nationals of Norway and, Denmark to guard
against such transfers brought about by the German invasion of those countries. Executive Order No. 8389, 5
Fed. Reg. 1400. It contained 'to all intents and purposes
the same definition of "banking institutions." See § 11 C
thereof. The order and regulations thereunder, and therefore the definition, were approved by the Joint Resolution." The definition applicable to transactions of this
Austrian national, AKM, under the freezing order of June
14, 1941, is set out below." We accept this definition
as authorized by the Resolution.
By the order appointing a permanent receiver, tV ,
claim of AKM against ASCAP was directed to be transferred from AKM to the petitioner. From ASCAP's
point of view it was a debt; from AKM'sa claim. The,
shift of obligation contemplated by the order for a per"54 Stat. 179:

manent receiver was a transaction that involved "property in which" there was an "interest of any nature
whatsoever, direct or indirect," in aliens of designated
countries, including Austria." But the Executive Order
of June 14,1941, did not prohibit all transactions without
license involving Austrian-owned property. It specified
the prohibited transactions, however, by categories so allinclusive as to make it clear that the purpose was to
require transactions involving property of nationals of
designated foreign countries to be carried out under regulations of this Government, except certain transactions
such as are provided for in General Ruling No. 12, April
21, 1942, 7 Fed. Reg. 2991. The Executive Order forbids
transfers of credit. As "credit" is not defined by the
.Order or regulation, we, in considering credits as property
subject to vesting under the Trading with the Enemy Act,
give it its ordinary meaning of the obligation due on
accounting between parties to transactions. This credit,
owed by ASCAP to AKM, was in effect directed to be
transferred by the permanent receiver order from AKM
to the petitioner as receiver. There is, we think, no doubt
that a voluntary transfer by a bank of a credit in the
transferring bank from the account of a known Austrian
to the account of another banking institution would violate Executive Order No. 8785 as a transfer of credit
between banking institutions.
It remains, then, to determine whether ASCAP and
petitioner are banking institutions of such a character as
to be subject to the prohibition of Executive Order No.
8785, § 1 A against "transfers of credit between any banking institutions." A reading of the President's definition,
note 12 supra, shows that they do fall- within the words
"any person holding credits for others as a direct or
incidental part of his business . . . ." It is true that
13 Executive Order No. 8785, supra.

Opinion of the Court.

to make ASCAP or the petitioner a banking. institution
by definition is a departure from the ordinary conception
of the meaning of "banking institution." Petitioner says
to so construe the definition is "utter fantasy." The
definition, however, as we have pointed out, has had
congressional ratification. Furthermore, the obvious intention of Congress to allow flexibility in the term "banking institution" by leaving its definition to the President sheds light on its purpose. The phrase "banking
institution" used and defined in the Bank Holiday Proclamation of March 6, 1933, 48 Stat. 1689, 1690, was
adopted by the Emergency Banking Relief Act of March
9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, with a delegation to the President
of the power of definition. Evidently the delegation was
to'permit him to bring atypical forms of financial institutions Within the reach of theemergency act. The Act
of March 9 was grafted on to the Trading with the Enemy
Act of 1917 and, when that Act was again extended to
meet the foreign assets problem, the President's wide
power to define "banking institution" was a ready instrument to cope with the myriad circumstances. arising in
the control of shifts .of foreign assets. The power .in
peace and in war must be given generous scope to accomplish its purpose. Through the Trading with the Enemy
Act, in its various forms, the nation sought to deprive
enemies, actual or potential, of the opportunity to secure
advantages to themselves or to perpetrate wrongs against
the United States or its citizens through the use of assets
that happened to be in this country. 14 To do. so has necessitated some inconvenience to our citizens and, others
who, as here, are not involved in any actions adverse to
the nation's interest. That fact, however, cannot Jead

us to narrow the broad coverage of the Executive Order.
Our prior decisions have made that clear. 5 ASCAP and
petitioner, the receiver, each hold credits for others as an
"incidental part of [their] business," and are therefore
"banking institutions." ASCAP held a credit for AKM
and, after the permanent receivership order, would hold
that credit for the receiver, who in turn would hold it for
AKM's creditors and AKM.
We hold that a transfer of this credit from a liability
owed by ASCAP to AKM, to a liability owed by ASCAP
to the receiver, would violate the prohibition against
transfers of credit.
We turn now to an examination of the effect of the
federal Executive Order No. 8785 of June 14, 1941, the
so-called "freezing order," on the subsequent state court
order of September 29, 1941, appointing the petitioner
permanent receiver. That examination is to be made
with recognition of the fact that, at the time of the state
order, title to the AKM claim against ASCAP had not
been vested in the Custodian. That development did not
take place until the vesting order of September 4, 1943.
It is petitioner's contention that a mere freezing order
does not prohibit a subsequent judicial order transferring
title to blocked assets covered by the previous freezing
order. We will deal subsequently in this opinion with
the question of whether the title to the claim passed to
the temporary receiver, under New York law, on his appointment. At this point, we assume this did not happen
and examine only the question of the effect of a freezing
order on the subsequent judicial order. Petitioner's argument is that such a construction would immobilize
frozen property until it suits the Custodian's convenience

Opinion of the Court.;

to vest, contrary to the need for, protection against transfers of foreign funds. These needs, petitioner says,. will
be served by the provision against payments to claimants from frozen funds without a license. E. 0. 8785..
§ lB.'0 He -further argues that by the Joint Resolutior
Congress did not empower the President to deprive NeA
York of all power to deal with the ASCAP debt in .E
proceeding under Civil Practice Act § 977-b, covering
actions of receivers to liquidate local assets of defunct
foreign corporations.
It is true that state litigation between local. claimants
and foreign owners or those in possession of blocked or
frozen assets could proceed to a determination of rights
between the claimant and the foreign national without
the blocked property passing into hands that might use it
to the detriment of the welfare of this nation, so long
as payment could not be made without a license. Nothing in the Trading with the Enemy Act or regulations
specifically forbids eo nomine litigation in state courts.
The plan for prohibition of unlicensed transactions by
foreign nationals comprehends blocking of transfers of
credits and vesting of local assets of such nationals under
the Trading with the Enemy Act and regulations thereunder. If transactions are blocked, vesting may or may.
not follow. When the Custodian vests blocked property,
title passes to the Custodian and his authority to vest
16 There is a suggestion that Congress could not, because of the
Tenth Amendment, constitutionally abrogate the power of New York
through its courts, in peacetime, to deal- with the local assets of
defunct foreign corporations. The chief reliance is placed upon Clark
V. Williard, 294 U. S. 211, a case that held that, as between states,
the state of the location of corporate assets had- control of their
distribution 'inliquidation. It cannot be seriously doubted that the
danger of war was sufficiently grave at the time of the freezing order,
3une 14, 1941, to justify the President's aotioh respecting Austrian
property.. Cf. Silesian-American Corp. v. Clark, 332 U. S. 469, 474477.

and hold cannot be questioned except as provided in the
Trading with the Enemy Act." The freezing order of
June 14, 1941, immobilized the assets covered by its terms
so that title to them might not shift from person to person, except by license, until the Government could deterfine whether those assets were needed for prosecution of
the threatened war or to compensate our citizens or ourselves for the damages done by the governments of the
nationals affected. United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U. S. 1, 11; Silesian-American Corp. v. Clark,
332 U. S. 469, 476.
We assume that the Court of Appeals of New York held
in Singer v. Yokohama Specie Bank that title to blocked
assets could pass without license from a statutory receiver to a creditor." As the Trading with the Enemy
Act is federal legislation founded on federal constitutional provisions, however, the- United States has authority to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying the
power into execution. The power to enact carries with it
final authority to declare the meaning of the legislation.

courts have so held as to this issue in this case, 169 F.
2d 324, 327, and in Bernstein v. N. V. NederlandscheAmerikaansche etc., 173 F. 2d 71, 73. The Trading with
the Enemy Act is national in range. The effect of a federal freezing order should be the same on subsequent
transfers of title in all states. State law determines the
effect of the appointment of a receiver on title to the
property administered, but federal law determines
whether the event of appointment can free the property
from the prior control. Cf. Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U. S. 188,
191, et seq.
Petitioner contends also that the administrative interpretation of the Executive Order of June 14, 1941, has
been to permit litigation as to rights in the frozen assets.
That is borne out by General Ruling No. 12 of April 21,
1942, 7 Fed. Reg. 2991, promulgated after petitioner had
begun his suit against ASCAP and referring to Executive
Order No. 8389, as amended June 14, 1941. The applicable section is set out in the margin. 1 It is to be
-observed, however, that the proviso of § (d) limits the
rights a litigant may obtain to such right as the owner of
blocked property could confer by voluntary act. General
Ruling No. 12, as it came after the suit by the receiver
against ASCAP was started and after the order appointing
petitioner as permanent receiver, is not treated by us a's

decisive in this case. It is useful only as a statemefnt of
the administrative determination as to the effect of litigation without a license.
It is our conclusion that the Joint Resolution of May 7,
194., and the Executive Order of April 10, 1940, put
into effect a valid plan for control of the property covered
by the regulation that prohibited any change of title to
that property by reason of the subsequent appointment
of petitioner as permanent receiver. We do not now undertake to say whether every determination of rights,
concerning blocked property in unlicensed litigation is
voidable. 'Webase our determination on the purpose of
Congress to,prevent shifts in title to blocked assets and
.the prohibition of the Executive Order against transfers of
such a credit as this: The. language of the order prohibits more than payment.. It prohibits .transfers of
credit. We do not think the administrative rulings are
to the contrary.
Second. Thq petitioner advances the contention, how.ever, thaj tite to AKM's claim against'ASCAP had
passed to him by his appointment as temporary receiver
on June 12, 1941, prior to. the freezing or blocking order
of June 14, 1941. Therefore, petitioner argues, AKM
had nothing that could be frozen by the immobilization
order or taken by the vesting order.
The .precise issue of state law involved, i. e.. whether
the temporary receiver under § 977-b of the New York.
Civil Practice Act is vested with title by virtue of his
appointment, is one which has not been decided by the
New York courts. Both the District Court and the
Court of Appeals faced this questibn -and answered it
in the negative. In dealing with issues'.f

that enter into judgments of federal courts, we are hesitant-to overrule decisions by federal courts skilled in the
law of particular states unless their, conclusions are shown

to be unreasonable. Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner,
335 U. S. 701, 707-708; Helvering v. Stuart, 317 U. S.
154; MacGregor v. State Mutual Co., 315 U. S.280. We
shall examine the problem from that point of view.
Having no state case on the precise statute before
it, the Court of Appeals turned to cases dealing with
temporary receiverships in equity proceedings and under
analogous statutes. These cases seem to hold that temporary receivers of neither the equity 20nor statutory 2
class obtain title, but, on the contrary, merely a right
to possession. The courts below found nothing in § 977-b
which evidenced an intent that the result under that
section should be otherwise. ' Admittedly there is no
express declaration of such an intent.
The statutory language is easily susceptible of varying
interpretations. See subsections 4, 10, 11, 12 and 19.
These sections are not clear as to the title taken by the
temporary receiver or the authority granted to him for
the holding or handling of claims against debtors.. The
Court of Appeals concluded, however, that where in
subsection 12 the statute said that "any receiver appointed .... shall have all the powers and duties

§§ 162, 163, 168, and annotations thereto. Petitioner calls our attention- to Nealis. v. American Tube & Iron Co., 150 N. Y. 42, 45, 44
N. E. 944, 945, a case not cited to the Court of Appeals. This case
says that a temporary receiver under a different statute "is vested
with title and represents the corporation and its creditors as fully
as a permanent receiver after final judgment of dissolution." P. 45.
This case, however, involved the right of a. temporary receiver to
sue. and the opinion deals with that problem rather than the distinction between a right to obtain possession and title. See In re
Warren E. Smith Co., 31 App. Div. 39,52 N. Y. S. 877,884.

possessed by and conferred upon receivers and trustees
by the laws of the state of New York," the meaning was
"that a temporary receiver under this provision takes the
usual powers of other temporary receivers in New York."
169 F. 2d 324, 327. It was pointed out that otherwise
the specific and restricted grant of powers to a temporary
receiver by subsection 4 would be purposeless.
Petitioner contends here for the first time
that a vesting of title in the temporary receiver is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction in rem over the
assets within the state of a nonresident association which
is served by publication. The contention is that an
affirmance of the court below on the issue of state law
will render proceedings under § 977-b subject to. an attack on constitutional grounds Under the doctrine of
Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. In our opinion the argument is without merit. Pennoyer v. Neff merely holds
that a personal judgment cannot be obtained against a.
nonresident on service by publication. It recognizes at
p. 733 that for an in rem action it is sufficient that
the property be within the state, subject to the control
of the court, and that there be some form of service
which is reasonably calculated to give notice to parties
whose interests may be affected by the judgment. Cf.
Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463. The' first requirement can be met in other ways than seizure of title,.
e. g., by an injunction against transfer of the property,
Pennington v. Fourth National Bank, 243 U. S. 269; by
an attachment, Herbert v. Bicknell, 233 U. S. 70; or by
personal service on the party holding the property within
the state, Security Savings Bank v. Calfornia, 263 U. S.
282. We have no doubt that where property is in a state
and comes under the' control of a court, as here by appointment of the temporary receiver, it is fair to permit
substituted service. Anderson. Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321

Opinion of the Cotirt.

U. S. 233, 240, et seq.; see McDonald v. Mabee, 243
U. S. 90.
Since the determination of the state law issue concerning the title of the temporary receiver by the courts below
is not unreasonable, we accept it as correct for the purposes of this case.
A suggestion appears in petitioner's briefs, but not in
the questions presented by the petition for certiorari,
that the judgments below should be vacated and the case
remanded to the District Court to be held until the parties
can secure from the courts of New York a decision as
to whether the temporary receiver took title to the claim
against ASCAP. Waiving the failure to raise the issue
by the petition for certiorari, 22 we consider the contention in deference to the earnestness with which the point
is pressed in the dissent.23 If the state law is that title
passed to the temporary receiver on his appointment prior
to the freezing order, the Custodian, by the assumption
of the opinion, would obtain nothing by his order vesting
AKM'property. Such a ruling would make unnecessary
consideration of any other issue.
This suggested procedure has been followed in order
to avoid a decision on a federal constitutional issue.Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101; Chicago

from exercising our jurisdiction when federal determination was subject to equitable discretion and the state issue'
was the only one in the case. Meredith v. Winter Haven,
320 U. S. 228.4 To refrain from deciding it, we there
.said, would be to enervate diversity jurisdiction.
Where a. case involves a nonconstitutional federal issue, however, the necessity for deciding which depends
upon the decision on an underlying issue of state law, the
practice in federal courts has been, when necessary, to
decide both issues. This was the course we followed in
Markham v. Allen, 326 U. S. 490, 495-6, a case arising
under the Trading with the Enemy Act, where an issue was
the construction of a state statute. The state law question in Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, supra, was
concededly difficult and unsettled; its decision admittedly
controlled the existence of a federal question, since a' finding' that there was no possibility of reverter under Illinois
law would have finally. determined the issue on which
the case was decided. And yet, although a method may
have existed for obtaining an adjudication on the issue
from the Illinois courts, 335 U. S. 632, 673-4, this Court
followed the procedure which We adopt here of depending
upon the determination of state law by the Court of
Appeals. 335 U. S. 701, 707-8. In so doing, it followed
the- decision ih Helvering v. Stuart, 317 U. S. 154, 161,

Opinion of -the Court.

state law should have that issue submitted to state courts
for decision. See the later decision in the same case,
Tompkins v. Erie R. Co., 98 F. 2d 49.
The cases mentioned above where this Court required
submission of single issues, excised from the controversy,,
to state courts were cases in equity. The discretion of
equity as to the terms upon which it would grant its
remedies, in the light of our rule to avoid an interpretation
of the Federal Constitution unless necessary, was relied
upon to justify a departure from normal procedure. In
the Magnolia case, we directed that the trustee file plenary proceedings to determine title in a state court litigation necessarily complete in itself. The complaint here
in a single count seeks recovery of the debt from ASCAP
and determination of the Custodian's title to the claim
vis-&-vis the receiver. Assuming that quieting title to
a chattel is' an equitable proceeding and that the District
Court can, by cutting Out the title issue and by refusing
'to proceed in the controversy unless. obeyed, compel the
Custodian .by whatever proceedings New York may provide to litigate only the narrow issue of title in the temporary .receiver, there would remain the problem of control of the receiver, by threats of contempt action, to
keep him, from raising in such proceedings federal issues
such as the right to secure title as permanent receiver
through state judicial action after the freezing or immobilization order. .This federal issue we decided above.
Furthermore, as the state court could reasonably require
complete adjudication of the controversy, the District
Court would perhaps be compelled to stay proceedings
in the state, court to protect its own jurisdiction. 28
U. S. C. § 2283. Otherwise, in sending a fragment of
the litigation to a state court, the federal court might
find itself blocked by res judicata, with the result that
the entire federal controversy would be ousted from the

federal courts, where it was placed by Congress. See note
17, supra.
The submission of special issues is a useful device in
judicial administration in such circumstances as existed
in the Magnolia;Spector, Fieldcrest and Pullman cases,
supra, but in the absence of special circumstances, 320
U. S. at 236, 237, it is not to be used to impede the normal
course of action .where federal courts .have been granted
jurisdiction of the controversy.
We reject the suggestion that a decision in this case
in the federal, courts should be delayed until -the courts
of New York have 'settled the issue of state law.
Third. The petitioner makes the further point that the
judgment below determining that he had no right, title
or interest to the claim of AKM. against ASCAP is beyond
the competence of the federal district court because that
property was in the hands of the state court by virtue
of the receivyership. ,Even if title did not pass, he argues,
he, and through him the state court, had possession of
the claim by virtue of his appointment as temporary
receiver before the promulgation of the freezing order.
Reliance is placed on the rulings of cases like Kline v.
Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 229, 231; Princess
Lida v. Thompson, 305 U. S. 456, 466; and Farmers'Loan
CO. v. Lake St. R. Co., 177 U. S. 51, 61. The rule declared by these cases is that when one court has taken
possession and control of a res, a second court is disabled
from exercising a power over that res. The circumstances
of this controversy do not present such an interference
with state control of a res. We are dealing with a situation more closely resembling determinations of rights
to participate in res in the hands of state courts.' What

the state court had, at most, was a claim against a debtor,
ASCAP. The judgment enabled the Custodian to collect the debt that ASCAP owed AKM.: Although this
judgment determined title to AKM's claim against
ASCAP when the adverse claimant was a state receiver,
those facts did not prevent the federal court from giving
a judicial declaration of the right to the claim. The
scheme of the Trading with the Enemy Act contemplates
that federal courts may provide such determinations.
§ 17; cf. Markham v. Allen, 326 U. S. 490, 495 The
congressional purpose to put control of foreign assets in
the hands of the President through the Custodian, so
that there might be a unified national policy in the administration of the Act, argues-strongly for federal determination of issues of rights in the blocked assets. Comity
does not require abnegation to the extent that a federal
court cannot adjudicate rights to the claim involved.

The Court recognizes that central to determining the
effect of the Alien Property Custodian's freezing and vesting orders is the effect under New York law of petitioner's
appointment as temporary receiver on June, 13, 1941.
It observes that "The preciseissue of state law involved,
i. e., whether the temporary receiver under § 977-b'of

decided by the New York courts." And it concedes that
the language of the relevant New York statutes "is easily
susceptible of varying interpretations." Yet it puts its
own interpretation on those statutes though that interpretation may be displaced tomorrow by the only courts
which have power to render an authoritative interpretation of New York lan-the courts of the State of New
York.
In other cases that have come before us in which decision of a federal issue or the necessity for its decision
depended on a seriously doubtful question of State law,
we have directed that application should first be made
to the courts of the State for final disposition of the
State question. Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co.,
309 U. S. 478; Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman
Co., 312 U. S. 496; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, 316
U. S. 168; Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323
U. S. 101; A. F. of L. v. Watson, 327 U. S. 582. In each,
of these cases the discretion of a federal court of equity
could practicably be exercised in a way which retained
ultimate jurisdiction of the case while permitting adjudication of the State question in the State courts. In each
there were available State procedures capable of providing a prompt decision, and the litigation had not already
consumed such an unconscionable amount of time as to
make recourse to them inexpedient. Cf. Public UtiTities
Comm'n v. United Fuel Gas Co., 317 U. S. 456'?" The
present case meets all those conditions, see N. Y. civ.
Prac. Act § 473, and should receive the same disposition.
It is true that in, all but one of these, cases recourse
to the State courts also served the purpose of avoiding
what might 'have proved to be unnecessary decision of
a constitutional issue. But see Thompson. *y Magnolia
Petroleum Co., 309 U. S. 478. Even more fundamental,
however, was recognition of the importance of maintain-

ing harmonious relations between parallel systems of
State and .federal courts in. a situation where, because
State law controlled, the State courts had the last word
and so a federal court at best could make only an informed guess. That this was a dominant- consideration
in the mind of the. Court appears plainly in the language
of its opinions. The following passages are illustrative:
1. "The last word on the meaning of Article 6445 of
the Texas Civil Statutes, and therefore the last Word on
the statutory authority of the Railroad Commission in this
case, belongs neither to us nor to the district court but
to the supreme court of Texas. In this situation a federal
court of equity is asked to decide an issue by making a
tentative answer which may be displaced tomorrow by a
state adjudication. . . . The reign of law is hardly promoted if an unnecessary ruling of a federal court is thus
supplanted by a controlling decision of a state court.
"Few public interests have a higher claim upon the discretion of a federal chancellor than the avoidance of needless friction with state policies, whether the policy relates
to the enforcement of the criminal law, Fenner v. Boykin, 271 U. S. 240; Spielman Motor Co. v. Dodge, 295
U. S. 89; or the administration of a specialized scheme
for-liquidating embarrassed business enterprises, Penn-'
sylvania v. Williams, 294 U. S. 176; or the final -authority.
of a state court to interpret doubtful regulatory laws of
the state, Gilchrist v. Interborough Co., 279 U. S. 159;
cf. Hawks v. Hamill, 288 U. S. 52, 61. These cases reflect a doctrine of abstention appropriate to our federal
system whereby the federal courts, 'exercising a wise discretion,' restrain their -authority because of 'scrupulous
regard for the rightful independence of the state governments' and for .the sm ooth working of the federal judiciary.

2. "We are of the opinion that the procedure which we
followed in the Pullman case should be followed here.
Illinois has the final say as to the meaning of the ordinance
in question. It also has the final word on the alleged
conflict between the ordinance and the state Act: The
determination which the District Court, the Circuit Court
of Appeals, or we, might make could not be anything more
than a forecast-a prediction as to the ultimate decision
of the Supreme Court of Illinois. . . . As we said in the
Pullman case, 'The resources of equity are equal to an
adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision' and any 'needless friction with state policies.' . . .
It is an exercise of a 'sound discretion, which guides the
determination of courts of equity.' Beal v. Missouri
Pacific R. Co., [312 U. S. 45, 50]. In this case, that
discretion calls for a remission of the parties to the state
courts, which alone can give a definitive answer to the
major questions posed. Plainly, they constitute the more
appropriate forum for the trial of those issues. See 54
Harv. L. Rev. 1379. Considerations of delay, inconvenience, and cost to the parties, which have been urged upon
us, do not call for a different result. For' we are here

So here, though no constitutional issue is present, regard for the respective orbits of State and federal tribunals
is the best of reasons, as a matter of judicial administration, for requiring a definitive adjudication by the New
York courts rather than proceeding on the basis of our
own tentative guess as to the meaning of the New York
statutes. That federal issues may remain is no justification for refusing to 'submit to the New York courts
a separable issue of New York law. We have no occasion to assume that they will go on to decide these federal
questions when a federal court has expressly retained
jurisdiction to decide them. Cf. Federal Power Comm'n
v. Pacific Power & L. Co., 307 U. S. 156, 160.
We should remand the case to the District Court with
instructions to retain jurisdiction pending submission to
the courts of New York by appropriate proceedings of
the question whether title to AKM's claim against
ASCAP passed to petitioner upon his appointment as
temporary receiver.
