was seriously injured in an accident at Big Spring, Texas.
Petitioner promptly brought suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act 1 in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. That court dismissed the action on the ground that the railroad could
not properly be served in that district. 72 F. Supp. 635
(1947). Petitioner appealed from this dismissal; and,
some days after taking the appeal, instituted an action
in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
An answer was filed in the latter action and a number
of depositions were taken.
In March, 1948, the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit held that the railroad was subject to service in
New York. 166 F. 2d 788. Thereupon petitioner moved
to dismiss his Texas action. When the district court
refused to dismiss, petitioner appealed and also applied
for a writ of prohibition to the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit. That court declined to issue the writ.
167 F. 2d 471 (1948). In No. 275, petitioner requests
this Court to issue a writ of certiorari to review the Court
of Appeals action. And in No. 119 Misc., we are asked
to issue a writ of prohibition directing the District Court
for the Northern District ,of Texas not to proceed with
the trial.. We are advised that counsel have arranged.
that further progress of the Texas trial shall be held in
abeyance pending our decision. We are this day denying
those petitions. See post, p. 912.
When the New York cause was returned to the district
court, after we had denied the railroad's petition for certiorani to review the Court of Appeals' determination that
it might be sued there 335 U. S. 814 (1948), petitioner
moved for a preference in the order of trial. The court

Opinion of the Court.

District of New York, denied this motion. Respondent
filed a cross-motion for an order transferring the action
to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. . This motion was granted. The order of
transfer relies on the authority of 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a),'
and cites Hayes v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 79 F. Supp:
821 (1948), and Nunn v-.-Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co.,
80 F. Supp. 745 (1948). To nullify this order, petitioner
moved this Court for leave to file a petition for a writ
of certiorari or a writ of mandamus or any appropriate
relief. We assigned the case for hearing on the motion
for leave to file. 335 U. S.897 (1948).
In support of his motion, petitioner urges that the general purposes of the 1948 revision of Title 28 by the
Congress indicate no intention to "emasculate" the right
to choose venue afforded under the Federal Employers'
Liability Act; that "any civil action," as used in
§ 1404 (a) of the Code, refers only to-civil actions~specifled in the Venue Chapter of Title 28 (9§ 1391-1406,
inclusive); and that the court below "ignored the known
temper of legislative opinion" as revealed chiefly by
Congressional action on the Jennings Bill.
We fail to see anything in these contentions which can
distinguish this case from Ex parte C61lett, decided this
day, ante, p. 55. In that opinion we have demonstrated that the venue provisions of § 6 of the Federal
Employers' Liability Act are one thing and the transfer
provisions of § 1404 (a) of the present Judicial Code
another; that "any civil action" ineans what it says; and
that Congress was fully informed as to the significance
"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of
justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other
district or division where it might have been brought." This provision became effective Sept. 1 1948. Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat.
