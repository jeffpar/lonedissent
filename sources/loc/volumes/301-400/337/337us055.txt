No. 206, Misc.

LEAVE TO FILE PETITION FOR WRITS
MANDAMUS AND PROHIBITION.

OF

Argued February 7, 1949.-Decided May 31, 1949.

Under 28' U. S. C. § 14Q4 (a), incorporated in the revision of the
Judicial Code effective September 1, 1948, the doctrine of forum
non conveniens is made applicable to actions under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act. Pp. 56-72.
1. This conclusion is required by the clear and unambiguous
language of § 1404 (a), which applies generally to "any civil
action." Pp. 58-59.
2. It involves no implied repeal of § 6 of the Federal Employers'
Liability Act, since that deals with the places where actions may
be brought originally, whereas 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a) deals with
the right to transfer an action properly brought. Pp. 59-61.
3. The legislative history of the revision of the Judicial Code
requires the same conclusion. Pp. 61-71.
4. As thus construed, § 1404 (a) is applicable to actions instituted before its effective date but not brought to trial prior to
its effective date. P. 71.
Motion denied.

Under 28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a), a Federal District Court
in which an action under the Federal Employers' Liability
Act, had been brought transferred it to a District Court
in another District, on the ground that this would serve
the convenience of parties and witnesses and be in the
interest of justice. Petitioner moved in this Court for
leave to file a petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition. The case was assigned for hearing on the
motion. 335 U. S. 897. Motion denied, p. 72.

Fred L. Wham, United States Judge for the Eastern District'of Illinois, respondent. With him on the brief was
Ernest Woodward.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON delivered the opinion of
the Court.
In this case we mustdecide whether the venue provisions of the Judicial Code' render applicable the doctrine of forum non conveniens to actions under the Federal Employers' Liability Act 2 Petitioner instituted such
an action against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad
in October, 1947, in the court below, the United States
District Court for', the Eastern District of. Illinois. No
trial was had before September 1, 1948, the effective
date of the present Judicial Code.' Thereafter the Railroad filed a motion to transfer the case to the District
Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.
The court below found that all 35 witnesses and the
petitioner himself live in Irvine, Kentucky, which also
was the scene of the accident; that Irvine is 420 miles,
"approximately twenty-four hours . . .by public transportation," from East St. Louis, where the court below
sits, but only 26 miles from Richmond and 48 from Lexington, in which two cities the District Court for the
Eastern District of Kentucky sits. Furthermore, the
court below determined that jury schedules at both
Richmond and Lexington made early trial possible. Thus
concluding that the transfer would serve the convenience
of partiei and witnesses, and would be in the interest of

justice, the District Court granted the Railroad's motion.
Petitioner then filed directly in this Court a "Motion
for leave to file petition for order to show cause why
writs of mandamus [against the court below] and prohibition [against the Kentucky District Court] should
not issue, and petition for same." Petitioner makes no
allegation that the court below abused its discretion; his
sole contention is that the order of transfer exceeded
the District Court's authority. Since that issue seemed
of importance in the administration of justice," we assigned the case for hearing on the motion. 335 U. S.
897 (1948).
Prior to the current revision of Title 28 of the United
States Code, forum non conveniens was not available in
Federal Employers' Liability Act suits. Baltimore &
Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 314 U. S. 44 (1941); Miles v.
Illinois Central R. Co., 315 U. S. 698 (1942); see Gulf
Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 505 (1947). The
new Code, however, provides that "For the convenience
of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other
district or division where it might have been brought."
This is § 1404 (a). The reviser's notes, which accom'At least five district court decisions dealing with the relationship of § 1404 (a) to FELA suits have been reported. Four have
held that the section is applicable. Hayes v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R.

pany each section of the Code, here read as follows:
"Subsection (a) was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a
more, convenient forum, even though the venue is proper.
As an example of the need of such a provision, see Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, 62 S. Ct. 6, 314 U. S.
44, 86 L. Ed, 28, which was prosecuted under the Federal
Employer's [sic] Liability Act in New York, although the
accident occurred and the employee resided in Ohio. The
new subsection requires the court to determine that the
transfer is necessary for convenience of the parties and
witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justice
to do so." I The precise issue before us is whether,
despite these expressions, the law remains unchanged.
Petitioner so contends.
First. The court below relied on the language of § 1404
(a), supra, which it regarded as "unambiguous, direct,
clear." We agree. The reach of "any civil action" is
unmistakable. The phrase is used without qualification,
without hint that some should be excluded. From the
statutory text alone, it is impossible to read the section
as excising this case from "any civil action."
The only suggestion petitioner offers in this regard
is that "any civil action" embraces only those actions
for which special venue requirements are prescribed in
§§ 1394-1403 of Revised Title 28," since these sections
5 H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. A 132 (1947); H. R.
Rep. No. 2646, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. A127 (1946).
6 The reviser's notes make clear that the phrase was substituted

for "suit," formerly used in various venue statutes, in the light of
Rule 2 of the. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.: "There shall be one form of
action to be known as 'civil action'."
T Section 1394 deals with any .civil action "by a national banking
association to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency"; § 1395,
proceedings "for the recovery of a pecuniary fine" and "for the forfeiture of property" under varying circumstances; § 1396, "Any civil

immediately precede § 1404 (a), and all are within the
Venue Chapter (§§ 1391-1406, inclusive) of the Code.
To accept this contention, we would be required completely to disregard the Congressional admonition that
"No inference of a legislative construction is to be drawn
by reason of the chapter in Title 28 . . . in which any
any [sic] section is placed .. ".."
8 Furthermore, petitioner's argument proves too much: §§ 1391-1393, which
also are in the Venue Chapter and also refer to "any civil
action," would be read as applying only to actions for
Which special venue requirements are established in
neighboring sections of the Code, although they were
obviously intended by Congress to be the general venue
sections applicable to ordinary actions. It seems more
reasonable to hold that § 1404 (a) in terms applies generally, i. e., to "any civil action."
.Second. Although petitioner wishes to restrict the literal meaning of "any civil action," he would expand the
sense of "may transfer .. . . to any other district or division where it might have been brought" beyond the exact
scope of those words. Obviously, the express language
gives no clue as to where the action "might have been
brought." Yet the essence of petitioner's position is that
the order below, transferring his suit, effects a repeal of
§ 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act, which granted
him the right to sue in any district "in which the defendaction for the collection of internal revenue taxes"; § 1397, "of
ihterpleader"; § 1398, "any civil action to enforce, suspend or set

aside in whole or in part an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission"; § 1399, "for the partition of lands, where the United
States is one of the tenants in common or joint tenants"; § 1400,
actions "relating to copyrights" or "for patent infringement"; § 1401,
"by a stockholder on behalf of his corporation"; § 1402, "against
the- United States"; and § 1403, "to condemn real estate for the
use of the United States."

ant shall be doing business at the time of commencing
such action." 9
Section 6 of the Liability Act defines the proper forum;
§ 1404 (a) of the Code deals with the right to trAnsfer
an action properly brought. The two sections deal with
two separate and distinct problems."0 Section 1404 (a)
does not limit or otherwise modify any right granted in
§ 6 of the Liability Act or elsewhere to bring suit in a
particular district. An action may still be brought in
any court, state or federal, in which it might have been
brought previously.
The Code, therefore, does not repeal § 6 of the Federal
Employers' Liability Act. We agree with petitioner that
Congress had no such intention, as demonstrated by its
failure to list the section in the meticulously prepared
schedule of statutes repealed." We cannot agree that
the order before us effectuates an implied repeal. The
inapplicability of forum non conveniens to Liability Act
9 "Under this chapter an action may be brought in a district
court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the
defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the
defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such
action ... ." 45 U. S. C. § 56. For a brief historical sketch, see
Baltimore & 0. R. Co. v. Kepner, 314 U. S.44, 49-50 (1941).
10 In almost every state, the requirements for venue and for transfer are treated in different statutory sections. Brief for New York,

and 1400, respectively, prescribe a new definition of appropriate
forums for actions against the Comptroller of the Currency, involving fines and forfeitures, internal revenue taxes and patent and copyright suits; and the following statutes are therefore listed as repealed:

suits derives from the Kepner decision. And there this
Court expressly stated that "If it is deemed unjust, the
remedy is legislative . . . ." 314 U. S' at 54. That opinion discusses § 6 of the Liability Act, to be sure, but this
Court did not and could not suggest that the legislative
answer had necessarily to be addressed to that section.
Since the words selected by Congress for § 6 denote nothing, one way or the other, respecting forum non conveniens, there was no occasion to repeal that section,
expressly or impliedly; Congress chose to remove its judicial gloss via another statute. Discussion of the law'of
implied repeals is, therefore, irrelevant.
Third. Petitioner's chief argument proceeds not from
one side or the other of the literal boundaries of § 1404
(a), but from its legislative history. The short answer
is that there is no need to refer to the legislative history
where the statutory language is clear. "The plain words
and meaning of a statute cannot be overcome by a legislative history which, through strained processes of deduction from events of wholly ambiguous significance,
may furnish dubious bases for inference in every drection." Gemsco v. Walling, 324 U. S. 244, 260 (1945).
This canon of construction has received consistent adherence in our decisions. 2
Nevertheless, we need not rest our decision on it solely.
For the legislative history does not support petitioner's
position. Petitioner's argument is based on these twin
premises: Congress intended no "controversial change"
to be incorporated in the Code; and § 1404 (a) is such a
change.

337 U. S.

To establish the former premise, petitioner cites a
number of statements by legislative leaders in charge
of the Code revision. For example, Representative Keogh, Chairman of the House Committee on the Revision of the Laws which initiated the work, said at the
hearing before the House Judiciary Subcommittee, "The
policy that we adopted . . . was to avoid wherever possible and whenever possible the adoption in our revision
of what might be described as controversial substantive
changes of law." 13 And Senator Donnell, Chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee considering the Code,
said on the floor that ". . . the purpose of -this bill is
primarily to revise and codify and to enact into positive law, with such corrections as were deemed by the
committee to be of substantial and noncontroversial
nature." 14 But these statements clearly arenot unequivocal promises that no changes would be made. The
legislation was announced to be a revision as well as a
codification. It is obvious that the changes in law retained in the Code were not considered as "controversial"
by these Congressional spokesmen.
Petitioner does not offer any definition of "controversial," but he does point to one concrete example of what
he regards as a "controversial" measure. This is the
13Hearings before House Committee on the Judiciary on H. R.
1600 and H. R. 2055, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1947). He also testified as follows: ". . . we proceeded upon the hypothesis that since
that was primarily a -restatement of existing law, we should not
endanger its accomplishment by the inclusion in the work of any
highly controversial changes in law." And, in response to the
Chairman's question, "And this bill does not include controversial
matters1" Rep. Keogh replied that "We have sought to avoid as
far as possible . . . any substantive changes that did not meet with
unanimity of opinion." Ibid., 11.
1494 Cong: Rec. 7928. (1948). The Senator had just given an
illustration of "various 'changes that have been made."

forums for Liability Act suits.
But the Jennings Bill
was far more drastic than § 1404 (a). The Jennings Bill
would in large part have repealed § 6 of the Liability
Act. It would have delimited the available forum for
actions brought in state as well as federal courts. 8 It
would have eliminated the right to sue in any district
in which the railroad did business. Initially, this applied
only to Federal Employers' Liability Act plaintiffs, but
in final draft the Jennings Bill generally restricted all,
including passengers, who might sue railroads for personal
injuries. Inasmuch as none of these changes in the law
was contained in the Code, it is evident that § 1404 (a)
might well be considered "noncontroversial" by the
same Congress which would regard the Jennings Bill
as "controversial."

19

17See, e. g., Hearings before House Committee on the Judiciary on
H. R. 1639, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-12, 17-22, 31-8 (1947); H. R.
Rep. No. 613, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 1, 3-6; Pt. 2, 1-2, 4 (1947).
"'As one of its three grounds of opposition to the Jennings Bill,
the minority Report stated, "The bill restricts State courts in the
administration of justice, deprives them of their prerogatives to
require change of venue of lawsuits where necessary, and transcends
the provisions of State laws governing the jurisdiction of State courts."
H. R. Rep. No. 613, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 2,1 (1947).
Doubt was expressed that Congress had constitutional power so
to affect state courts. See, e. g., letter of. Acting The Assistant to the
Attorney General, Hearings before Senate Committee on the Judiciary
on S.1567 and H. R. 1639 (Jennings Bill), 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 215
(1948).
19Furthermore, petitioner's argument suggests at most that
§ 1404 (a) was as "controversial" as the Jennings Bill, as of July,
1947. Thereafter, however, both the Code and the Jennings Bill
were referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings on both. The same three Senators composed the Subcommittee
holding these hearings: Sen. E. H.. Moore, Chairman at the hearings on the Jennings Bill in January, 1948; Sen. Donnell, Chairman
at the hearings on the Code in April and June, 1948; and Sen.
McGrath. The relationship between the two proposals was ex-

Moreover, even if we could distill from the legislative
history of the Jennings Bill a usable concept of "controversial change," its application would destroy petitioner's case. For petitioner concedes that in fact § 1404 (a)
did not arouse controversy; he submits the Jennings Bill
as contrast. His argument is obviously based not on
the actual legislative history of § 1404 (a), but on necessarily vague speculation as to what Congress might have
done had it fully realized that forum non conveniens
was henceforth to be applicable in Federal Employers'
Liability Act suits. The requisite assumption, that Congress did not appreciate the significance of its action
when it ratified the Code and § 1404 (a) therein, is contrary to the facts shown by the legislative history which
is of record. The lack of controversy reflected aware
agreement and not the inertia of ignorance.
This was scarcely hasty, ill-considered legislation. To
the contrary, it received close and prolonged study. Five
years of CongressJ.onal attention supports the Code.' And
from the start, Congress obtained the most eminent expert assistance available. The spadework was entrusted
to two lawbook-publishing firms, the staffs of which had
unique experience in statutory codification and revision.2
pressly called to their attention. See Hearings before Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 1567 and H. R. 1639 (Jennings Bill),
80th Cong., 2d Sess. 111-112 (1948). The Committee reported the
Code favorably, albeit with amendments; but the Jennings Bill was
not reported.
It is clear that only the Tax Court provisions were regarded by the
Senate Committee as sufficiently "controversial" to be deleted.

not mean that Congress blindly approved what outsiders

Petitioner almost seems to imply that thisvery careful

the Committee system is integral in typical legislative
procedure; Congress could not function without it."8 A
canon of construction which would discount statutory
words -pro tanto, the greater the expertise or the more
meticulous the Committee consideration devoted thereto,
or the longer and more complex the legislation, would
be absurd, not least because it would make mockery of
the techniques of statutory interpretation which have
heretofore been used by the courts.

of the Federal judiciary; that they were sent to the appropriate committees of the leading State and local bar
associations; that they were sent to everyone who ever
evidenced any interest in the work at all." 27 Indicative
of the success in publicizing the provisions of the Code
is the fact that there was specific treatment of § 1404 (a)
and its applicability to Federal Employers' Liability Act
suits in a number of legal periodicals.'
The initial appearance of § 1404 (a) Was in the Second
Draft of the Code, adopted by the meeting of May, 1945.
Its text has remained unchanged. It was accompanied
by a reviser's note, which recited that "Subsection (a) is,
new. It was drafted in accordance with a memorandum
of Mar. 7, 1945, from the author of Moore's Federal

that note was substantially the same as the present
reviser's note; it expressly cited the Kepner case, an action
under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, as demonstrating the need for § 1404 (a). And the reviser's notes
were before the Congress at every subsequent legislative
step.
A preliminary draft of the Code was printed late in
1045 for the use of the House Committee on Revision of
the Laws. In this draft, the reviser's notes appear directly below each related section or subsection. Section
1404 (a) and its note were in this draft,' which, as noted
above, was given very wide circulation.

the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary Committee and
was assigned to a Subcommittee of which Representative
Robsion of Kentucky was Chairman. At the hearing before this Subcommittee, Professor James William Moore
of Yale University, special consultant to the revisers, in
summarizing the Code proposals, testified that there were
."changes of importance" in the law of venue and specifically mentioned § 1404.'1 In April, 1947, the House
Judiciary Committee reported the bill with a unanimous
recommendation that it be passed.3 This Report again
fully reprinted the reviser's notes. In this Report, the
section entitled "Examples of Changes in Law," which
had appeared in the Report on the revision in the preceding Session of Congress, expressly referred to the
reviser's notes for §§ 1391-1406.2
After this painstaking consideration, with its references
to § 1404 (a), the House initially passed the bill on July
7, 1947.' At that time and in the subsequent consideration in the Senate, the Tax Court provisions occasioned
the most discussion; but other specific sections did not
pass unnoticed. Attention was directly called to § 1404
(a) by one witness at the hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee, although his interest was not
in the Federal Employers' Liability Act issue.36 No
change in § 1404 (a) was included in the Senate amendments; and the revision of Title 28 was enacted by the
Congress in June, 1948."'

Thus, at almost every stage 6f the legislative procedure,
attention was directed to the fact of change, and in most
instances specific mention was made of § 1404 (a): At
no stage subsequent to the first formal printing did § 1404
(a) and its accompanying reviser's note fail to appear.
From the start, § 1404 (a) remained the same, and the
reference in the note to a Federal Employers' Liability
Act case as showing the need for permitting the application of forum non conveniens remained unchanged.
Now to hold that Congress did not appreciate what it
was enacting in that section would defy the legislative
history. We must flatly reject petitioner's thesis that this
section was so obscured that its enactment is meaningless.
We cannot blind ourselves to the hearings, to the experts,
to the Committee reports, to the reviser's notes and their
incorporation in the Committee reports-to a history of
the most meticulous Congressional consideration.
Fourth. Petitioner suggests that his action 'may not be
transferred because it was instituted prior to the effective
date of the Code. Clearly, § 1404 (a) is a remedial provision applicable to pending actions. And "No one has
a vested right in any given mode of procedure . .. .

Fifth. Since the petition for mandamus and prohibition must be denied because of the view we must take
as to the meaning of § 1404 (a) and its applicability to
this case, we need not decide whether denial might be
placed on other grounds also. "Mandamus, prohibition
and injunction against judges are drastic and extraordinary remedies. . . . As extraordinary remedies, they are
reserved for really extraordinary causes." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S. 258, 259, 260 (1947)."
What we hold is that the plain meaning of the, statutory words and the consistent course of the legislative
history are opposed to petitioner's contention that we
must disregard § 1404 (a) because Congress knew not
what itdid. If petitioner's showing could sustain a decision that this section was not really enacted, after all,
little law would remain.
The motion is
Denied.

I concur in the result. But in doing so I feel impelled
to say two things.

§ 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and of the

other statutes mentioned by MR.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

in-

cluding the venue provisions (§ 12) of the Clayton Act
involved in our decision in United States v. National City
Lines, 334 U. S. 573.
The legislative history, for example, of the Clayton Act
venue provisions demonstrates that the change § 1404 (a)
is said to have made was more than the mere removal
of a judicial gloss. I think we should not now impugn
the validity of our decisions in National City Lines,-supra,
and in Kepner and Miles1 by characterizing each as a mere
"judicial gloss" upon the pertinent statute. Those decisions in my opinion were true reflections of congressional
intent as stated in the respective statutes and, acdordingly,
the changes made in them by § 1404 (a) were in the nature of repeals, to the extent that the plaintiffs were
deprived of their rights under the pre-existing statutes
to have their causes of action tried in the forums where
they were properly brought.
In the second place, those changes, although entirely
within Congress' power to make, were neither insubstan,tial nor noncontroversial, in view of the legislative history
of the original provisions, for exanmple, the venue provisions of the Clayton Act. Nor do I think the legislative
history of § 1404 (a) demonstrates either the insubstantial
or the noncontroversial nature of the changes in § 1404
(a), although they seem to have been so treated by those
in charge of the bill.2 It is to be noted, moreover, that

specific attention was drawn to the effect of § 1404 (a)
upon § 6 of the Employers' Liability Act through reference to the Kepner and Miles decisions, but no like specific reference was made to the venue provisions of the
Clayton Act and the National City Lines decision.
These matters make it impossible for me to concur
in the view that Congress was in fact "fully informed
as to the significance of § 1404 (a)." This, however, is
a matter affecting congressional procedure and the manner of conducting legislative business. Accordingly, notwithstanding my doubts that Congress intended to go
so far, I acquiesce in the Court's decisions.
