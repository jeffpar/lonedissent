OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

307 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Claims' dismissing a suit brought to compel restoration of
trust funds alleged to have been diverted by the
appellee.
In 1926 Congress granted permission for the bringing
of the suit,2 which was instituted April 13, 1927. In
order to permit the claim to be presented in its present
form the permissive act was amended in 1934.' The appellants then filed an amended petition to which the appellee responded by a general traverse. The right of appeal from the judgment of the Court of Claims is Qonferred by Joint Resolution of June 22, 1936.'
The suit is for the enforcement of equitable claims arising under or growing out of the Act of January 14, 1889.1
The appellants' theory is that the Act constituted an offer
on the part of Congress for an agreement with the bands
of Chippewas located in Minnesota, whereby, if these
bands would cede the Indian title to their reservations,
(which they did), the United States would sell the timber
thereon and open the agricultural lands to settlement, and
hold the proceeds of the timber and the lands, in trust, to
expend the income for purposes specified in the statute, including payment of a portion of such income to the Indians, and to distribute the principal at the expiration of
fifty years after allotments had been completed to all the
members of the various bands on specified reservations.

CHIPPEWA INDIANS v. U. S.
I

Opinion of the Court.

The circumstances leading to the adoption of the Act
and its relevant sections appear in earlier decisions of this
Court and need not here be repeated.'
The appellants assert that, by the Act of 1889, Congress abdicated its plenary power of administration of the
Chippewas' property as tribal property, recognized that
the reservations of the respective bands were not tribal
p~operty, and agreed to hold the proceeds of the ceded
lands in strict and conventional trust for classes of individual Indians in accordance with the program outlined
in the Act.
In this view the living Chippewas are beneficiaries of
the income of the fund during the fifty year period, and
individual Chippewa Indians who may be living at the
expiration of the period, as a class, are remaindermen.
It is urged that, as Congress has, from time to time, reimbursed the Treasury for expenditures for the benefit
of the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota out of the fund,
and has authorized other direct expenditures from the
fund for the benefit of the Indians in ways not authorized
by the Act, the United States has been guilty of a diversion of trust funds and that the appellants, as the
representatives of the remaindermen, are entitled, on
plain principles of equity, to demand restoration of the
diverted sums to the corpus.
If, as the Court of Claims has found, the Act of 1889,
and the cessions made pursuant to it, did not create a
technical trust, we are relieved from considering many of
the contentions pressed by the appellants in that court
and here. We are of opinion that the Court of Claims
was right in its decision that no such trust was
created.
The original tribal status of the Chippewas is described in Wilbur v. U]nited States, 281 U. S. 206, 208,
'Wilbur v. United States, 281 U. S. 206, 209, 210; Chippewa
Indians v. United States, 301 U. S. 358, 362.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

and Chippewa Indians v. United States, 301 U. S. 358,
360. It is unnecessary now to restate what was there
said on the subject.
It is true that, prior to the adoption of the Act of
1889, the tribe had been broken up into numerous bands,
some of which held Indian title to tracts in the State of
Minnesota. The Act refers to these collectively as "The
Chippewas in the State of Minnesota." Whether or not
the tribal relation had been dissolved prior to its adoption, the Act contemplates future dealings with the Indians upon a tribal basis. It exhibits a purpose gradually to emancipate the Indians and to bring about a
status comparable to that of citizens of the United
States. But it is plain that, in the interim, Congress
did not intend to surrender its guardianship over the
Indians or treat them otherwise than as tribal Indians.
This is evidenced by a series of acts, the first of which
was adopted nineteen months after the Act of 1889,
which are inconsistent with the view that the Congress
considered the Indians as emancipated or intended to
enter into a binding contract with them as individuals.7
Many of these statutes refer to the Chippewas of Minnesota as a tribe.8 Moreover, an examination of the Act
'Aug. 19, 1890, c. 807, 26 Stat. 336, 357. Between 1890 and 1926
Congress appropriated, either from the fund created under the Act
of 1889 or from public funds reimbursable therefrom, a total of
$5,105,059 for the civilization and support of the Chippewas. (Findings 9, 10, 15.) During the period 1889 to 1934 Congress authorized
the expenditure of public funds totaling $5,065,878 for the use and
benefit of the Chippewas without any provision for reimbursement.
(Finding 20.)
'Aug. 1, 1914, c.222, 38 Stat. 582, 592; May 18, 1916, c. 125,39 Stat.
134, 135; March 2, 1917, c. 146, 39 Stat. 969, 979; May 25, 1918, c.
86, 40 Stat. 561, 572; June 30, 1919, c.4, 41 Stat. 3, 14; February 14,
1920, c. 75, 41 Stat. 408, 419; November 19, 1921, c. 133, 42 Stat.
221; January 30, 1925, c. 114, 43 Stat. 798; February 19, 1926, c. 22,
44 Stat. 7; March 4, 1929, c. 705, 45 Stat. 1562, 1584.

Syllabus.

of 1889 discloses that it is not cast in the form of an
agreement; and, we may not assume that Congress
abandoned its guardianship of the tribe or the bands and
entered into a formal trust agreement with the Indians,
in the absence of a clear expression of that intent.
It is not contended that the expenditures made from
the fund, or reimbursed from it, were not for the benefit of the Indians or were not such as properly might be
made for their education and civilization, the purposes
stated in the Act of 1889.
We hold that the Act did not tie the hands of Congress so that it could not depart from the plan envisaged
therein, in the use of the tribal property for the benefit
of its Indian wards.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is
Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 441. Argued February 28, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.
1. Under R. S. ยง 4886, a patent for an invention made but not patented or published in a foreign country, is good, in a suit for
infringement, against an innocent infringing use in this country for
which no patent right is claimed and which began before the date
of the application but after the actual date of the invention.
Pp. 10 et seq.
2. R. S. ยง 4887 contains no provision which precludes proof of facts
respecting the actual date of invention in a foreign country to overcome the prior knowledge or use bar of ยง 4886. P. 12.
3. R. S. ยง 4923, which provides that if the patentee, at the time of
his application, believed himself the original or first inventor, his
patent shall not be refused or held void by reason of the invention
having been known or used in a foreign country, before his invention or discovery, if it had not been patented or described in
