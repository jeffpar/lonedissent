OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

Mr. Frederick H. Wood, with whom Mr. Wm. D. Whitney was on the briefs, on the reargument and on the
original argument, for petitioner.
Mr. Nathan L. Miller, with whom Messrs. W. W. Miller
and Redmond F. Kernan, Jr. were on the briefs, on the
reargument and on the original argument, for respondent
in No. 590.
Mr. Harry Hoffman, with whom Mr. Clifford R. Schuman was on the briefs, on the reargument and on the
original argument, for respondents in No. 591.
By leave of Court, briefs of amici curiae were filed by
Solicitor General Jackson, Messrs. Paul A. Freund, Edward H. Foley, Jr., Bernard Bernstein, John W. Pehle,
and Joseph B. Friedman,on behalf of the United States,
urging applicability of the Joint Resolution to the obligations involved; and by Messrs. Arthur B. Weiss and
Abraham L. Pomerantz, urging affirmance in No. 590.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the
Court.
As did Nos. 384 and 495, this day decided, ante, p. 247,
these cases involve efforts to enforce foreign currency
provisions of bond obligations payable in money of the
United States and optional fixed amounts of foreign currencies. The obligations are essentially similar to those
in Nos. 384 and 495, but differ in two respects: (1) the
bonds, originally sold in this country to a group of
bankers,' were offered by that group not only in this
country, but also abroad, and (2) the present holders are
foreign corporations, some of whose bonds were bought
in foreign countries. These distinctions do not remove
' Some bonds were originally issued to stockholders in No. 590.

Opinion of the Court.

foreign holders from the operation of the Joint Resolution
of June 5, 1933.
Respondents did not purchase their bonds or elect to
demand payment in foreign currency until after the effective date of the Resolution. The court below held
the Resolution was not applicable.2
It is respondents' contention that their bonds represent
a form of private international obligation, in no wise subject to the laws of the United States. However, they
seek to enforce that obligation in this country and Congress has, as it constitutionally may, provided that multiple
currency provisions of dollar obligations are against public policy here and, thus, unenforceable. The Constitution provides "This Constitution, and the Laws of the
United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof;
and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law
of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any
State to the Contrary notwithstanding." Courts in this
country, State and Federal, can no longer enforce the
contractual provisions which respondents have proceeded
on, irrespective of their place of making.
. In the absence of any claim of international rights
based upon the treaty provision of the Constitutio:4, it is
enough that respondents' bonds are "obligations payable
in the money of the United States," as we have this day
held.
Under the governing principles announced in Nos. 384
and 495, the multiple currency provisions of respondents'
bonds are within the operation of the Resolution, and
their coupons are dischargeable dollar for dollar in current
legal tender money of the United States.
Reversed.

Statement of the Case.

307 U. S.

The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS, MR.
JUSTICE BUTLER and MR. JUSTICE STONE think the judgments in these cases should be affirmed, for reasons stated

Trust Co. v. Henwood, ante, p. 247.
LANE v. WILSON ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 460. Argued March 3, 1939.-Decided May 22, 1939.
1. A negro who is denied by state registration officials the right of
registration, prerequisite to the right to vote, under color of a state
registration statute which, in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment,
works discrimination against the colored race, has a right of aciion
in the federal court for damages against such officials under R. S.
1979; 8 U. S. C. ยง 43. Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475, distinguished.
P. 274.
2. This resort to the federal court may be had without first exhausting the judicial (distinguished from administrative) remedies of
the state courts. P. 274.
3. Oklahoma statutes made registration prerequisite to voting, and
provided generally that all citizens qualified to vote in 1916 who
failed, to register between April 30 and May 11, 1916, should be
perpetually disfranchised, excepting those who voted in 1914. The
effect was that white people who were on the lists in 1914 in virtue
of the provision of the Oklahoma Constitution called the "Grandfather Clause" which this Court in 1915 adjudged unconstitutional,
Guinn v. United States, 238 U. S. 347, were entitled to vote;
whereas colored people kept from registering and voting by that
clause would remain forever disfranchised unless they applied for
registration during the limited period of not more than 12 days.
Held repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment. P. 275.
98 F. 2d 980, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 305 U. S. 591, to review the affirmance of
a judgment, on a verdict directed for defendants in an
action for damages, under R. S. 1979.
