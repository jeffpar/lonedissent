"neither practice nor rule of the committee concerning
the apportioning among the Society's members of the
pooled license fees realized is shown," " does not affect
the rights members have in the apportionment of the

DRISCOLL ET AL., CONSTITUTING PENNSYLVANIA
PUBLIC UTILITY COMM'N, ET AL. v. EDISON
LIGHT & POWER CO.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 509.

Argued February 7, 8, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.

1. The provision of the Act of May 14, 1934, withholding from the
District Courts jurisdiction over suits to enjoin on the ground of
unconstitutionality the enforcement of state orders fixing public
utility rates, "where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy at law
or in equity may be had in the courts of such State,"--held inapplicable by its terms to a suit attacking temporary rates ordered
by the Public Utilities Commission in Pennsylvania, where the

remedy by injunction is confined to proceedings "questioning the
jurisdiction of the commission," and where the remedy at law by
appeal does not postpone the rates pendente lite. Pp. 108 et seq.
2. The provisions of § 310 (a) of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities
Act for fixing temporary public utility rates are not limited to utilities which keep continuing property records. Section 310 (b)
furnishes a partial alternative method. P. 112.
3. Section 310 (a) of the Act empowers the commission to fix temporary rates, to be charged pending final determination of the rate
proceedings, which shall be sufficient to provide a return of not
less than 5% upon original cost, less accrued depreciation, of the
utility's physical property used and useful in the public service.
Section 309 requires that permanent rates when deterfiined shall
be "just and reasonable." In fixing the base for temporary rates
in this case, the commission did not confine itself to the single
factor of original cost less depreciation, but interpreted § 310 (a)
as requiring that weight be given also to reproduction cost, going
concern value and the necessity for working capital, in compliance
with the rule laid down by this Court in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S.
400. Held, that in the absence of any decision of the state court on
the subject, this interpretation of § 310 (a), not inconsistent with
its terms, sh6uld be accepted. P. 114.
A different construction would raise the novel and important
question of the constitutionality of a temporary rate, based solely
on depreciated original cost, with provision of the statute for
recoupment of the loss from insufficient temporary rates as provided in § 310 (e).
4. This Court adopts a just and reasonable construction of 5 state
statute rendering it clearly constitutional rather than another that
puts its validity in doubt. P. 115.
5. In determining a rate base, failure to include allowance for cost
of financing is not erroneous where the evidence reveals no actual
expenditures 'for that purpose and furnishes no foundation for an
estimate. P. 116.
6. It does not appear from evidence that in determining rate base
the commission failed in this case to make due allowances for
going concern value; nor that, in estimating depreciated reproduction cost, it failed to make adequate allowance for indirect costs,
such as interest, supervision, financing, taxes, legal expenses, or
refused to consider claimed increase of prices. P. 117.
7. Six per cent. held not an inadequate rate of return in the case
of an electric power company which operates in a stable com-

munity accustomed to the use of electricity and close to the capital
markets, with funds readily available for secure investment. Long
operation and adequate records make forecasts of net operating
revenues fairly certain. Under such circumstances a six per cent.
return after all allowable charges can not be confiscatory. P. 119.
8. Even where the rates in effect are excessive, in a proceeding by a
commission to determine reasonableness the utility should be allowed its fair and proper expenses for presenting its side to the
commission. P. 120.
9. In the allowance for such rate-case expenditures, the period over
which they are to be amortized will depend upon the character of
services received or disbursements made. P. 121.
There could rarely be an anticipation of annually recurring
charges for rate regulation. Under the circumstances here prerented where full statistics on investment, inventory and labor
requirements have been made which, as cumulated, will form largely
the basis of all future negotiations, the Court is of the opinion that
amortization over a ten year period is reasonable.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an appeal from the decree of a three-judge district court granting a permanent injunction against the
enforcement of temporary rates. § 266, Jud. Code.
The appellants are five named persons, individually and
as members of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the Utility Consumers League of York, Pennsylvania, intervening defendant below, an unincorporated
association of consumers of electric current in the territory served by the appellee. The latter is a public utility
corporation organized under the laws of Pennsylvania,
which generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric
energy to approximately 30,000 customers in and about
York, Pennsylvania.
An investigation to determine the reasonableness of appellee's rates was instituted on January 27, 1936. During
its progress the state legislature recodified the utility law
of Pennsylvania. Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1938 Supp., Title 66, § 1101 et seq.
It enacted a temporary rate section, 310, which is the
source of this controversy.
Acting under § 310, the commission, after notice and
argument, issued a temporary rate order on July 13, 1937,
requiring the utility to file rate schedules which would
effect a reduction of approximately $435,000 in annual
gross operating revenues. This order was replaced by
another on July 27, 1937, which commanded an identical
reduction. This time the commission itself prescribed a

schedule of rates. The utility filed a bill in equity in a
statutory court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
On October 15, 1937, a permanent injunction issued.'
The Commission did not appeal. On November 30, 1937,
another order was issued seeking to establish the same
temporary rates and to secure the same reduction in gross
revenues as the orders of July 13 and 27.
On December 14, 1937, the utility filed a bill in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania to enjoin this order. A three-judge court
was convened under § 266 of the Judicial Code. By
stipulation of the parties the application for an interlocutory injunction brought to hearing on January 17, 1938,
was treated as an application for a permanent injunction.
On October 14, 1938, a permanent injunction issued.
The court concluded as a matter of law that the utility
had no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the state
courts; that the order is void because the "commission
acted in direct violation of the mandatory provisions of
the Public Utility Act which requires rates for [the company] to be fixed under paragraph (b) of section 310";
that the order is unconstitutional because (1) it violates
the procedural requirements of due process, (2) it fails to
permit the utility to earn a fair return on the fair value
of its property used and useful in the public service, (3)
it confiscates the company's property, and (4) it is not
supported by substantial evidence 2

order attacked as violative of the Federal Constitution
affects. the rates of a public utility, does not interfere with
interstate commerce and has been made after notice and
hearing, the jurisdiction of the district court to enjoin its
enforcement is withdrawn, unless no "plain, speedy and
efficient remedy may be had, at law or in equity, in the
courts of such State." No challenge to the jurisdiction
was made in the statutory court or on appeal. In response to questions from the bench, counsel for the commission conceded that there was no remedy in the state
courts which would satisfy the Johnson Act.
The reason for this concession lies, so far as a remedy
in equity is concerned, in the provision of the Pennsylvania statute forbidding an injunction against an order,
"except in a proceeding questioning the jurisdiction of
the commission. ' '
The bill in certain allegations attacks the section of the Public Utility Law under which
this order issued as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it empowered the commission to fix noncompensatory and discriminatory temporary rates, in an
arbitrary manner. In one sense this questions the ju4 Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, 261 U. S. 290, 292; Herkness v.

risdiction of the commission. If § 310 is invalid, there
is no other provision to authorize temporary rates. Jurisdiction is a word of uncertain meaning. As used in
§ 1111, supra, it apparently refers to proceedings by the
commission under the terms of the statute. In this use
it would permit an injunction, equitable grounds being
shown, where the public utility is not covered by the
act. Otherwise, action in excess of the powers of the
commission, such as a confiscatory rate, might be deemed
beyond its jurisdiction. At any rate, without an authoritative determination. by the state courts, we cannot say, for this character of proceeding, that the remedy in the state courts is plain, speedy and efficient.'
The remedy at law by appeal is ineffective to protect the
utility's position pendente lite. The supersedeas does
not postpone the application of the temporary rates.7
The statutory court had jurisdiction of the bill.
Statutory Basis for the Order.--Sec. 310 ' contains several subsections. The commission fixed the temporary

discussing § 310 (b), the court declared § 310 (a)

uncon-

stitutional because it permitted the commission to fix
a temporary rate based upon the single factor of origi-

nal cost less depreciation.

The commission, however,

did not confine itself to that one element in setting the
fair value of the appellee's property, for the purpose of
temporary rates, at $5,250,000. It gave weight to reproduction cost, original cost, going concern value and the
necessity for working capital, and it allowed on this rate
base a return of more than six per cent.

used and useful in the public service, and if the duly verified reports
of such public utility to the commission do not show such original

estimate such cost less depreciation and fix, determine, and prescribe
rates as hereinbefore provided.
"(b) If any public utility does not have continuing property
records, kept in the manner prescribed by the commission, under the
provisions of section five hundred two of this act, then the commission, after reasonable notice and hearing, may establish temporary
rates which shall be sufficient to provide a return of not less than an
amount equal to the operating income for the year ending December
thirty-first, one thousand nine hundred thirty-five, or such other
subsequent year as the commission may deem proper, to be determined on the basis of data appearing in the annual report of such
public utility to the commission for the year one thousand nine
hundred thirty-five, or such other subsequent year as the commission may deem proper, plus or minus such return as the commission
may prescribe from time to time upon such net changes of the
physical property as are reported to and approved for rate-making
purposes by the commission. In determining the net changes of the
physical property, the commission may, in its discretion, deduct
from gross additions to such physical property the amount charged
to operating expenses for depreciation or, in lieu thereof, it may
determine such net changes by deducting retirements from the gross
additions: Provided, That the commission, in determining the basis
for temporary rates, may make such adjustments in the annual report
data as may, in the judgment of the commission, be necessary and

satisfies the requirement of § 310 (a) that the temporary
rates shall produce not less than 5% on the "original
cost, less accrued depreciation."
Appellee's first contention is that the decree may be
sustained for the sole reason that the commission should
have proceeded under subsection (b) because the appellee
does not have continuing property records. As the conclusion of the lower court on this point is not supported
by a state decision, we analyze for ourselves the provisions of the sections. It is clear from the language of
§ 310 (a) that it is applicable not only to public utilities
whose reports to the commission show the original cost
of their physical property but also to those whose original
cost is not so shown. The last clause of the section authorizes the commission to estimate such cost. There
is no provision in 310 (a) which limits its application to those utilities which maintain the continuing property records of § 502.11 Section 310 (b), see note 9, furnishes a partial alternative for § 310 (a). Where there
are no continuing property records, as provided by § 502,
the commission must in fixing the temporary rate arrange for at least a five per cent return on original cost
under (a) or the return of an operating income under (b)
equal to that for the year 1935 or a subsequent year, as
determined by the commission.
"P. L. 1053, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1938 Supp., Title 66, § 1212.
"Continuing property records.-The commission may require any
public utility to establish, provide, and maintain as a part of its
system of accounts, continuing property records, including a list or
inventory of all the units of tangible property used or useful in the
public service, showing the current location of such property units
by definite reference to the specific land parcels upon which such
units are located or stored; and the commission may require any
public utility to keep accounts and records in such manner as to
show, currently, the original cost of such property when first devoted
to the public service, and the reserve accumulated to provide for
the depreciation thereof."

DRISCOLL v. EDISON CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Appellee urges next that the section permits the commission to disregard present cost, depreciate original cost,
omit indirect and overhead items of construction, and
exclude allowances for working capital or going concern
value. Although these items were considered by the commission, the appellee contends that the order is invalid
because § 310 (a) might have been complied with by
providing a return of 5% on the original cost depreciated.
The argument seems to be that a statute which permits
an unconstitutional determination is invalid, even though
it is actually applied in a constitutional manner. 2
The commission drew the order in accord with the
prior ruling of the Middle District Court on a former
order in this rate proceeding." The former order had
also fixed temporary rates but had not set out the findings
of value deemed essential by the court. Although the reversal of the commission's order had actually turned on
the failure to show the factual basis for the rates, as the
district court had stated that compliance with Smyth v.
Ames 14 was necessary in temporary rate making, the commission based the order now under review on evidence
requisite under that rule. By taking this position, it interprets the statute as requiring consideration of elements
other than original cost in fixing temporary rates. It is
not suggested that the commission omitted consideration
of any necessary element in the present order. If we assume with the appellee that the constitutionality of a

delegation of rate making authority is to be tested by
what a rate making body may rightfully do under the
delegation rather than what it does, appellee's case is advanced not one whit. We have here an interpretation of
the Pennsylvania statute by the board charged with its
enforcement that it must weigh all the essential elements
of valuation required by our past decisions.
There is nothing in the language of § 310 (a) which
requires a different construction. The commission is authorized to fix temporary rates. There is no requirement
as to how the rates are to be determined, except that they
shall be sufficient to return a given minimum-not less
than 5% on the original cost, less depreciation. The
language authorizing the fixing of temporary rates is cast,
except as to the limitation just referred to, in much the
same pattern as the language of § 309 authorizing the
determination of permanent rates. The latter section
reads: ". . . the commission shall determine the just and
reasonable rates . . ." A different construction would
raise the novel and important question of the constitutionality of a temporary rate, based solely on depreciated
original cost, with provision for recoupment of the loss
from insufficient temporary rates. 5 In the absence of an

authoritative state decision, we are reluctant to accept a
construction which brings forward that issue, particularly
when the case may reasonably be determined upon the
interpretation of the officials of the state charged with the
administration of the act.16 This course observes the very
salutary rule that "this Court will not decide an issue of
constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably
be decided under a construction of the statute under
which the act is clearly constitutional." "
Confiscation.-There remains for examination the appellee's argument that the decree of the district court
enjoining the enforcement of the order should be sustained because it is confiscatory. The commission, as of
November 30, 1937, found the rate base, revenue, expenses and rate, as set out below. 8 Appellee urges here
that the commission's figures are erroneous in the following particulars: (1) The rate base should be $5,866,081;
(2) the rate should be 71/2 per cent; (3) two items of
expense, disallowed by the commission should be added
to the operating expenses, (a) some increase in annual
salaries and (b) rate case expenses on books to November
porary order and the gross income which would have been obtained
under the rates finally determined if applied during the period such
temporary order was in effect." Cf. Prendergast v. New York Telephone Co., 262 U. S. 43; Bronx Gas & Electric Co. v. Maltbie, 271

15, 1937; (4) allowance should be made for a prospective
loss of annual profit by reason of the loss of a large customer, through abandonment of railway service by York
Railways Company.
(1) The commission estimated the original cost as of
December 31, 1936, at $4,576,169.73. The company estimated the original cost as of November 30, 1936, exclusive of financing charges, at $4,619,364.00 and its book
cost as of December 31, 1936, at $4,578,793.00. If, to
the highest of these items, we add $164,000 for working
capital and $142,851.07, representing net additions to
September 30, 1937, the amounts claimed by the company, the original cost rate base is found to be not more
than $4,926,215.07.
The commission excluded the cost of financing because there was no evidence of any actual expenditures
for such purpose or of any studies of such cost. We find
no error in this.19 There was here no foundation for an
estimate." Appellee's suggestion that evidence supporting its claim is found in the capitalization chart of York
Railways Company, the owner of appellee's common
stock, is not accepted. This shows the discount, $298,825.00, paid by the parent company on $2,706,000 face
amount of bonds of various issues between 1909 and 1925.
It appears that $1,027,904 of the proceeds was expended
for construction work of the York Edison Company, apparently appellee's predecessor. Nothing is shown as to
the cost of this money to the appellee. It may have given
notes for or been charged with this exact amount, without
a finance charge. The financing cost to appellee may
have been covered by the interest rate.

Opinion of the Court.

The commission made no specific allowance for going
concern value. It did, however, state that it had weighed
the going concern value with other factors to determine
fair value. It gave practical effect to this consideration
when it fixed fair value several hundred thousand dollars
in excess of its average of original and reproduction cost,
both depreciated. In the computations by the company
of original and reproduction costs, allowances were made
for the overhead expense of creating the aggregate of land,
buildings, and equipment, making up the utility. No
tangible evidence of any unusual situation justifying any
definite further allowance appears in the testimony of
appellee's witness Seelye. The plant of the utility without the utilization of its production by the community
would be of little value. Expenditures to secure customers through advertisement and solicitation, as well
as to install connections do not appear separate from the
ordinary operating and construction costs. The appellee
points to the character of the territory served, the company's ability to earn, the efficiency of the management,
the adequate available power supply and the excellent
capital structure as indicative of a going concern value
above tangible property plus overhead. To appraise these
elements apart from and in addition to reasonable cost
figures would require evidence of a failure on the part of
the commission to give reasonable weight to these factors.
This evidence is lacking here. 1
For depreciated reproduction cost as of November 30,
1936, the commission accepted the estimate of the company for direct costs, $3,981,347. It added 19%, $756,456,

for indirect costs and reached a total of $4,737,803. This
finding reduced the indirect costs from the 24.3 per cent
claimed by the company. Evidence was introduced before the commission supporting each percentage estimate.
The amount of these indirect costs likely to be incurred
is too uncertain for us to conclude that the percentage
adopted is erroneous.22 We cannot see that the failure of
the commission's witness Bierman to inspect the property
made less valuable his estimate on the proper percentage
to be applied for indirect costs. These indirect costs are
of the character of interest, supervision, cost of financing,
taxes and legal expense.
The utility states that the commission, in fixing the
reproduction cost, erred by refusing to consider the effect of a claimed increase of prices. The commission,
on November 30, 1937, fixed reproduction cost upon a
computation based by the utility upon prices as of November 30, 1936. This showed a gross cost of $5,572,134,
depreciated and reduced by the commission, as explained
in the preceding paragraph, to $4,737,803. The utility
presented a further computation, showing as of May 31,
1937, that increased prices, due to a rising level, would
increase the gross cost to $6,019,832. The argument is
that the later estimate should have been considered. 3
Proportionally reduced to accord with the action of the
commission, this latter figure would become $5,118,465.
If to this higher reproduction cost we add working capital, there appears a reproduction cost depreciated figure
of $5,282,465.
It is furthermore to be observed that the commission's
figures do not differ far as to fair value, from the estimate
of an important witness for the utility, Mr. Seelye, who
testified on March 12, 1937, that the fair value was not
less than $5,500,000 and said later in answer to the com"Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Comm'n, 292 U. S. 290, 311.

missioner's question that the fair value, in his opinion,
was $5,500,000. This estimate was reiterated on December 20, 1937, in the affidavits of Mr. Seelye and Mr.
Wayne, the President of the company, in support of the
motion for temporary injunction.
For the purpose of passing upon the issue of confiscation in the temporary rates, we shall accept $5,500,000
as the fair value of the property as of November
30, 1937.
(2) The rate of return was fixed by the commission
at six per cent. Witnesses for the utility brought out facts
deemed applicable in the determination of a proper rate
of return on the fair value of the property. Their evidence took cognizance of the yield of bonds, preferred
and common stocks of selected comparable utilities, the
stagnant market for new issues, prevailing cost of money,
the implications of the possible substitution of some governmentally operated or financed utilities for those privately owned and the dangers of a fixed schedule of
rates in the face of possible inflation. From these factors they deduced that a proper rate of return would be
from 7.8 per cent to 8 per cent. An accounting expert
of the commission countered with tables showing yields
of bonds of utilities; the yield to maturity of Pennsylvania public utility securities, approved by the commission between July 1, 1933, and May 7, 1937, long term
and actually sold for cash to non-affiliated interests;
yield of Pennsylvania electric utilities; financial and operating statistics of Pennsylvania electric utilities;
money rates, and other material information. He
concluded 5.5 per cent was a reasonable rate of return.
It must be recognized that each utility presents an
individual problem.24 The answer does not lie alone in

average yields of seemingly comparable securities or even
in deductions drawn from recent sales of issues authorized
by this same commission. Yields of preferred and common stocks are to be considered, as well as those of the
funded debt. When bonds and preferred stocks of well
seasoned companies can be floated at low rates, the allowance of an over all rate return of a modest percentage
will bring handsome yields to the common stock. Certainly the yields of the equity issues must be larger than
that for the underlying securities. In this instance, the
utility operates in a stable community, accustomed to the
use of electricity and close to the capital markets, with
funds readily available for secure investment. Long
operation and adequate records make forecasts of net
operating revenues fairly certain. Under such circumstances a six per cent return after all allowable charges
cannot be confiscatory.
(3) and (4). The utility urges that two items of expense and a prospective loss should be added to the
operating expenses, allowed by the commission, of $1,382,829. The most important of these items is the rate case
expenses. The company by its Exhibit 21 shows these
incurred to November 15, 1937, to be $178,374.50. The
commission from Exhibit 23 found them to be $127,935
for the twelve months ending September 30, 1937. The
difference probably comes from the expenses before and
after the period considered by the commission. We assume the higher figures to be correct. As the commission
concluded that the prior rates of the company were
obviously excessive, it allowed nothing for expense in
defending them. Consequently there is no discussion
of the reasonableness of the amount of the company's
charge and we accept them as reasonable. Even where
the rates in effect are excessive, on a proceeding by a
commission to determine reasonableness, we are of the
view that the utility should be allowed its fair and proper

expenses for presenting its side to the commission. We
do not refer to expense of litigation in the courts. "A
different case would be here if the company's complaint
had been unfounded or if the cost of the proceeding had
been swollen by untenable objections." 5
In the allowance of these expenses, the period over
which they are to be amortized will depend upon the
character of services received or disbursements made.
There could rarely be an anticipation of annually re-.
curring charges for rate regulation. Under the circumstances here presented where full statistics on invest-.
ment, inventory and labor requirements have been made
which, as cumulated, will form largely the basis of all
future negotiations, we are of the opinion that amortization over a ten year period is reasonable.2 ' As such an
adjustment produces an estimated return very close to
the reasonable rate, even with the addition- to the operating expenses of the other items of increased salaries,
$20,593, and prospective loss of annual profit, $15,089,
we do not enter into a discussion of them. Experience
will add its weight to the other evidence on further hearing. The note below shows the calculation. 7
At best, these estimates are prophecies of expected returns. The incalculable factors of business activity, un22West

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER,

concurring.

The decree below was clearly wrong. But in reversing it, the Court's opinion appears to give new vitality
needlessly to the mischievous formula for fixing utility
rates in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466. The force of
reason, confirmed by events, has gradually been rendering that formula moribund by revealing it to be useless
as a guide for adjudication. Experience has made it
overwhelmingly clear that Smyth v. Ames and the uses
to which it has been put represented an attempt to erect
temporary facts into legal absolutes. The determination
of utility rates-what may fairly be exacted from the
public and what is adequate to enlist enterprise-does
not present questions of an essentially legal nature in the
sense that legal education and lawyers' learning afford
peculiar competence for their adjustment. These are
matters for the application of whatever knowledge
economics and finance may bring to the practicalities of
business enterprise. The only relevant function of law
in dealing with this intersection of government and enterprise is to secure observance of those procedural safeguards in the exercise of legislative powers which are the
historic foundations of due process.
Mr. Justice Bradley nearly fifty years ago made it clear
that the real issue is whether courts or commissions and
legislatures are the ultimate arbiters of utility rates, (dissenting, in Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota,
134 U. S. 418, 461). Whatever may be thought of the
wisdom of a broader judicial r6le in the controversies
between public utilities and the public, there can be no

doubt that the tendency, for a time at least, to draw
fixed rules of law out of Smyth v. Ames has met the rebuff of facts. At least one important state has for
decades gone on its way unmindful of Smyth v. Ames,
and other states have by various proposals sought to
escape the fog into which speculations based on Smyth
v. Ames have enveloped the practical task of administering systems of utility regulation.
Smyth v. Ames should certainly not be invoked when it
is not necessary to do so. The statute under which the
present case arose represents an effort to escape Smyth v.
Ames at least as to temporary rates. It is the result of
a conscientious and informed endeavor to meet difficulties
engendered by legal doctrines which have been widely
rejected by the great weight of economic opinion,' by
authoritative legislative investigations,2 by utility commissions throughout the country,' and by impressive judicial dissents.' As a result of this long process of experience and reflection, the two states in which utilities play
the biggest financial part-New York and Pennsylvaniahave evolved the so-called recoupment scheme for temporary rate-fixing (thereby avoiding some of the most

wasteful aspects of rate litigation) as a fair means of
accommodating public and private interests. It is a carefully guarded device for securing "a judgment from experience as against a judgment from speculation," Tanner v. Little, 240 U. S. 369, 386, in dealing with a problem
of such elusive economic complexity as the determination
of what return will be sufficient to attract capital in
the special setting of a particular industry and at the
same time be fair to the public dependent on such enterprise.
That this Court should not "decide an issue of constitutionality if the case may justly and reasonably be decided under a construction of the statute under which the
act is clearly constitutional" is, as an abstract proposition,
basic to our judicial obligation. But this is not a formal
doctrine of self-restraint. Its rationale is avoidance of
conflict with the legislature. The opinion from which
the preceding quotation is taken and the decisions to
which it refers are all cases in which constitutionality
was in obvious jeopardy. It is one thing to avoid unconstitutionality even at the cost of a tortured statutory construction. It is quite another to recognize the validity of
a statute directed expressly to the situation in hand and
so employed by the state authorities, when constitutionality of that statute is as incontestably clear as the decision
of the New York Court of Appeals has demonstrated it
to be in sustaining the sister statute of the Pennsylvania
Act, In the Matter of Bronx Gas & Electric Co. v. Maltbie,
271 N. Y. 364; 3 N. E. 2d 512. The Court's opinion in
the present case does not avoid issues of constitutionality.
It accepts the much more dubious constitutional doctrines
of Smyth v. Ames and its successors to solve the very easy
constitutional issues raised by the Pennsylvania Act.
