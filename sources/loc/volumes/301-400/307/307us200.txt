UNITED STATES v. MARXEN, TRUSTEE.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 544.

Argued March 28, 1939.-Decided May 15, 1939.

R. S. § 3466, giving to the United States priority in payment of
debts due to it by any person who is insolvent, is inapplicable
to a general claim in bankruptcy which was transferred to the
United States, or to which it became subrogated, after the filing
of the petition in bankruptcy. P. 207.
So held as to a claim-assumed to be a claim of the United
States-upon a note assigned to the United States by a bank after
the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by the maker. The note
was covered by a policy of insurance issued to the bank under
the National Housing Act; the maker had defaulted; and the
balance due was paid to the bank by U. S. Treasury check subsequently to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.
QUESTION certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals
upon an appeal from an order of the District Court, 24 F.
Supp. 463, which confirmed and approved an order of
the referee in bankruptcy denying priority to a claim.

Opinion of the Court.

By leave of Court, Mr. Harry Loeb Mostow filed a
brief, as amicus curiae, urging that the question certified
be answered in the negative.
MR.

JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The case is here on certificate from the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with a request for instructions needed in a pending cause. § 239, Jud. Code; 28
U. S. C. § 346. The following facts are stated: On August
10, 1934, the Federal Housing Administrator issued a
policy of insurance, under the provisions of the National
Housing Act, Title 1, § 2,1 to the California Bank, a
banking corporation. On January 2, 1936, the California Bank, under the protection of this policy, made a
loan to the Monterey Brewing Company. The company
paid part of the indebtedness but defaulted on the balance on February 2, 1937. On April 5, 1937, it filed a
petition in bankruptcy and was adjudicated a bankrupt.
Under the insurance contract the bank had to wait until
60 days after default before making claim upon the Administrator. The 60 days expired two days before bankruptcy of the company. The bank, however, did not present its claim to the Administrator until July 3, 1937;
the latter paid August 4, 1937, by draft drawn on the
'"Sec. 2. The Administrator is authorized and empowered, upon
such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure banks . . .
which are approved by him as eligible for credit insurance, against
losses which they may sustain as a result of loans and advances of
credit, and purchases of obligations representing loans and advances
of credit, made by them ... for the purpose of financing alterations,
repairs, and improvements upon real property. In no case shall the
insurance granted by the Administrator under this section to any
such financial institution exceed 20 per centum of the total amount
of the loans, advances of credit, and purchases made by such financial
institution for such purpose . . ." Act of June 27, 1934, c. 847, 48
Stat. 1246.

Treasury of the United States; the bank assigned the
note to the "United States of America." Later the Administrator filed a claim upon the note in the name of
the United States of America.
The referee allowed it as a general claim only. The
district court approved. In re Monterey Brewing Co.,
24 F. Supp. 463. On the appeal to the circuit court of
appeals the following question, decisive of the controversy,' was certified:
"Where, prior to the filing of a petition for and adjudication in bankruptcy of the maker of a promissory
note payable to a bank, the Federal Housing Administrator, under the provisions of the National Housing Act,
insured the payee bank against the nonpayment of the
note by its maker, upon which note the maker became
in default more than sixty days prior to said filing and
adjudication, and upon demand of the insured bank
made after the adjudication, the Federal Housing Administrator paid to the bank its claim arising from such
default, and procured an assignment to the United States
of the claim of the insured bank against the bankrupt
which claim had not been presented or proved in bankruptcy by the insured bank, and presented such claim
in the name of the United States to the trustee inbankruptcy having before him other allowed claims against
the bankrupt, issuch claim entitled to priority over such
other claims under sec. 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31
U. S.C. A. § 191) by reason of the provisions of sec. 64
(b)(7)[11 U. S.C. A. § 104 (b)(7)1."

owing to any person who by the laws of... the United
States isentitled to priority: Provided, that the term

."
Section 3466 of the Revised Statutes, the basis for the
claimed priority, provides that "Whenever any person
indebted to the United States is insolvent ... the debts
due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the
priority hereby established shall extend . ..to cases in
which an act of bankruptcy is committed."
Although an amendment of the National Housing Act
authorized the Administrator to sue and be sued in any
court of competent jurisdiction, state or federal,4 it is not
necessary in answering the present certificate to determine whether by this addition the Congress intended to
give the Administrator the status of a corporation or
other entity distinct from the United States and by such
status to confer on or withhold from claims of the Federal Housing Administration against bankrupts the advantages of § 3466.' We can deal only with a claim of
the Federal Housing Administration assigned to the
United States after the adjudication in bankruptcy of
the obligor. It is assumed that such a claim belongs to
and is made by the United States.'

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

307 U. S.

Before considering the applicability of § 3466 to claims
of the United States acquired after the bankruptcy of the
obligor, we must examine the contention of the Government that it possessed a provable claim at the time the
petition in bankruptcy was filed. This assertion predicates an agreement, express or implied, by the obligor
to indemnify the Government for any loss it may sustain
by reason of its insurance of the bank. The question
certified contains nothing as to the contract of insurance
except that it was under the provisions of the National
Housing Act and "insured the payee bank against the
non-payment of the note by its maker." The section of,
that act, quoted above, does not indicate any privity between the bankrupt maker and the Government based
upon the insurance contract. Even if we accept as accurate the statement in the certificate that the Administration insured against the non-payment of this note,'
there is nothing in the record to connect the maker with
the insurance. The Government attempts to fill in the
facts lacking in the certification by printing in its brief a
regulation of the Federal Housing Administration, Number 10 of July 15, 1935,' and the form of credit statement
from the note maker to the bank in use, presumably, at'This is not in accord with the practice under Title I of the National Housing Act. The act is administered so as to create an
insurance reserve for each approved financial institution of not to
exceed the authorized percentage of the total amount of qualified
paper. Cf. Regulations, Federal Housing Administration, Property
Improcement Loans, 3 Federal Register 358, regulation number 17.
"'The question of the financial condition of the borrower is left
to the reasonable judgment of the insured institution as a credit
matter. The borrower must furnish the lending institution a
financial or credit statement, approved as to form by the Administrator, which in the judgment of the insured institution shows the
borrower to be solvent, with reasonable ability to pay the obligation
and in other respects a reasonable credit risk in view of the insurance provided by the National Housing Act."

the time of the loan. The form contains this sentence,
as well as information as to the applicant's employment
or business, his income and the property to be improved:
"The following information is given for the purpose of
inducing you to grant credit under the provisions of Title
I of the National Housing Act."
The regulation and the credit statement certainly do
not supply the facts necessary to the conclusion that this
particular form of credit statement was used. As the
certificate does not show the State in which the note was
executed, payable or enforceable, we are left to speculate
as to the applicable law of indemnity. It is not clear
that a voluntary guarantor can recover in every jurisdiction from the involuntary principal who has not requested the service.' But even if we assume that such a
guarantor may recover upon an implied promise of reimbursement, the rule is not effective here. The statement
of the case and the question certified show that the claim
in bankruptcy of the Government is based upon the note,
duly assigned to it after bankruptcy. As no proof was
made of any claim for reimbursement, such a claim is
not involved. 10
The claim on the note, assigned to the United States
subsequently to the maker's bankruptcy, has priority,
if at all, by virtue of the general provisions of § 3466, as
recognized by § 64 (b) (7) of the Bankruptcy Act.1

estate is secured by the individual undertaking of any person, fails
to prove such claim, such person may do so in the creditor's name,
and if he discharge such undertaking in whole or in part he shall be
subrogated to that extent to the rights of the creditor." Act of

That subdivision granted priority ahead of dividends to
creditors, to claims entitled to priority under the laws of
the United States. Priority has been secured to the
United States in varying language throughout its history,1 2 The tendency has been to interpret these provisions liberally to secure the advantage sought by the
Congress."5 "As this statute has reference to the public
good it ought to be liberally construed." ' It has been
said that "nothing else appearing" even claims under
the railroad Federal Control Act would be entitled to
priority." But this principle of construction is subject
to the limitation that the generality of the language of
the section is restricted by the purpose to grant priority
to the United States, only, and by legislative intention,
as shown by other statutes. Consequently priority was
refused to corporations wholly owned by the United
States 1 6 and to the Director General of Railroads because
12The

Government summarizes the legislative background as fol-

lows: "The Act of July 31, 1789, Sec. 21, c. 5, 1 Stat. 29, 42, first gave
the United States priority but was limited to debts due on bonds
for duties. The Act of May 2, 1792, See. 18, c. 27, 1 Stat. 259, 263,
allowed sureties who paid their debts to the United States to exercise
their priority. The Act of March 3, 1797, Sec. 5, c.20, 1 Stat. 512,
515, extended the priority to all debts due from any person. The
Act of March 2, 1799, Sec. 65, c.22, 1 Stat. 627, 676, applied to
bonds for duties. R. S., Sec. 3466 is derived from the Acts of 1797 and
1799."

Opinion of the Court.

§ 10 of the Federal Control Act manifested an intention
that the carriers under federal control should be treated as
before their transfer to federal operation. 1 7 The United
States itself when it sought priority for its loans under
the Transportation Act was denied the benefits of § 3466
because the intention to build up the credit standing of
the railroads was inconsistent with the claimed priority."
We are of the view that § 3466 is inapplicable to
general claims in bankruptcy transferred to, the United
States, or to which it has become subrogated on payment,
after the filing of the petition, for the reason that the
rights of creditors are fixed by the Bankruptcy Act as of
the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. This is true
both as to the bankrupt and among themselves. 9 The
assets at that time are segregated for the benefit of
creditors. 0 The transfer of the assets to someone for
application to "the debts of the insolvent, as the rights

prior to bankruptcy or insolvency in the Wagner and Dickson cases.

insolvency.
