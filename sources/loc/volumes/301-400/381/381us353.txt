DECISIONS PER CURIAM.
381 U.S.

May 24, 1965.

atory judgment, this case should be transferred to the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. If the Court
is holding by its action that the case is properly here
because of the fact that the 1955 action was commenced
by the Government, then the case raises substantial
questions as to the scope of the Expediting Act which
should be resolved only after plenary consideration. See
Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting, Inc. v. ASCAP, 375
U. S. 39.
We would therefore "postpone jurisdiction" and set the
case for argument.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
