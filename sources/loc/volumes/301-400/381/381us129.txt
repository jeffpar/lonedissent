Per Curiam.

v. CITY OF TALLAHASSEE.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE SECOND JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,
LEON COUNTY, FLORIDA.

No. 958.

Decided May 3, 1965.

A minor procedural defect which petitioners tried to correct does
not constitute an adequate independent state ground for decision
barring review by this Court. The petition for writ of certiorari
is granted and the judgment is reversed. Robinson v. Florida, 378
U. S. 153.
Certiorari granted and judgment reversed.

Jack Greenberg and Derrick A. Bell, Jr., for petitioners.
Roy T. Rhodes and Edu. J. Hill for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is granted and the
judgment of the Florida Circuit Court is reversed. Robinson v. Florida,378 U. S. 153.
Respondent asserts that the judgment below rests on
an adequate independent state ground in that petitioners,
through misunderstanding or oversight, failed to obtain
certification of the Circuit Court record submitted with
their otherwise timely petition for writ of certiorari in the
Florida District Court of Appeal, First District. Petitioners tried to correct this nonjurisdictional defect (see,
e. g., Aris v. State, 162 So. 2d 670 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.))
when notified of it, but their petition was dismissed nonetheless. We do not find this procedural ground adequate
to bar review by this Court. See Staub v. City of Baxley,
355 U. S. 313; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449;
NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U. S. 288.
