PER CURIAM.

294 and United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 377
U. S. 271.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN

and MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dis-

senting.
We would note probable jurisdiction and set the case
for argument. In so. voting, we indicate no opinion on
the merits. Under the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. ยง 29 (1964 ed.), this is appellant's
first and only appeal. So long as this statute remains on
the books and Congress provides no intermediate review,
see United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U. S.174, 175,
it is our view that the policy of the Act is, in general, best
served by plenary rather than summary dispositions of
such appeals. Ibid. Of course, if the question presented
by an appeal is plainly insubstantial or directly governed
by a controlling decision of this Court, summary disposition would still be appropriate. Since we do not believe
that this can be said of this case, we would give plenary
consideration to this appeal.
