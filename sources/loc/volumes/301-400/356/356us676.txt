UNITED STATES v. PROCTER & GAMBLE
CO. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.

No. 51.

Argued April 28, 1958.--Decided June 2, 1958.

Followiag a federal grand jury investigation of possible criminal
violations of the Sherman Act, in which no indictment was returned,
the Government brought a civil suit-under § 4 of the Act to enjoin
alleged violations of §§ 1 and 2 by appedlees. The Government was
using the grand jury transcript to prepare the civil case for trial,
and appellees moved for discovery and production of the transcript, in order that they might have the same privilege. The
District Court ruled that appellees had shown "good causb," as
required by Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and
granted the motion. Being unwilling to prodtice the transcript,
the Government moved that the order be amended to provide that,
if production of the transcript were not made, the Court would
dismiss the complaint. The order was so amended; the Government persisted in its refusal to produce the transcript; and the District Court dismissed the complaint. The Government appealed
to this Court. Helc"
1. The rule that a plaintiff who has voluntarily dismissed his
complaint may not appeal from the order of dismissal has no
application here, since the Government's motion to amend the
original order was designed only to expedite review of that order.
Pp. 680-681.
2. Appellees failed to show "good cause," as required by Rule 34,
for the wholesale discovery and production of a transcript of the
grand jury's proceedings, which pursuant to a long-established
policy must normally be kept secret, when they did not show that
the criminal procedure had been subverted to elicit evidence in a
civil case. Pp. 681-684.
Reversed.

Robert A. Bicks argued the cause for the United States.
On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant
Attorney General Hansen, Daniel M, Friedman and
W. Louise Florencourt.
