the complaint alleged that the defendants had successfully presented false applications for crop loans to the
Commodity Credit Corporation, a wholly owned government corporation. The defendants moved to dismiss the
complaints, arguing that a claim against Commodity
was not a claim "against the Government of the United
States, or any department or officer thereof" as required
by .the Act. The Dist*rict Court granted the motions to
dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded
for trial. 244 F. 2d 27. Because of a conflict in the circuits' we granted certiorari, 355 U. S. 811, solely to consider whether false claims against Commodity are covered
by the False Claims Act.
Commodity is an "agency and instrumentality of the
United States, within the Department of Agriculture,
subject to the general supervision and direction of the
Secretary of Agriculture." - It was created by Congress
to support farm prices and to assist in maintaining and
distributing adequate supplies of agricultural commodities. Its capital was provided by congressional appropriation. Any impairment of this capital, 'which at
times 'has been great due to the nature of its activities,'
is replaced out of the public treasury; any gains are
returned to that treasury. All of its officers and other
personnel are employees of the Department of Agriculture and are compensated as such. Like other government corporations, Commodity is subject to the provisions of the Government Corporation Control Act which
such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent . . .shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than one nor more than five years, r,
fined not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars.T

provides such close budgetary, auditing and fiscal contfols that little more than a corporate name remains to
distinguish it from the ordinary government agency.'
In brief, Commodity is simply an administrative device
established by Congress for the purpose of carrying out
federal farm programs with public funds.
In our judgment Commodity is a part of "the Government of the United States" for.purposes of the False
Claims Act.6 That Act was originally passed in 1863
after disclosure of widespread fraud against the Government during the War Between the States. It seems quite
clear that the objective of Congress was broadly to protect the funds and property of the Government from
fraudulent claims, regardless of the particular form, or
function, of the government instrumentality upon which
such claims were made. Cf. United States ex rel.
Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 544-545.7 By any ordinary standard the language of the Act is certainly comprehensive enough to achieve this purpose. In reaching
our conclusion, we are aware that the civil portion of the
Act incorporates, as a test of liability, the provisions
of the criminal section as they were set out in § 5438 of
the Revised Statutes of 1878,8 and that according to
5 59 Stat. 597, as amended, 31 U. S. C. § 841 et seq.

No. 2, Part 2, 37th Cong., 2d Sess.
S Originally Congress provided both criminal and civil sanctions
in the same statute. 12 Stat. 696. By the Revised Statutes of 1878
the civil sanctions were codified as § 3490, while the criminal provisions were separately enacted as § 5438. Section 3490 permitted the
Government to recover forfeitures and damages for those acts prohibited by § 5438, e. g., submission of false or fraudulent claim.
"against the Government of the United States, or any. department or
officer thereof." See note 1, supra. The civil provisions as enacted
.in § 3490 have never been altered.

Opinion of the Court.

familiar principles the scope of these provisions should
be confined to their literal terms. Yet even penal provisions must be "given their fair meaning in accord with
the evident intent of Congress." United States v.
Raynor, 302 U. S. 540, 552.
In 1918 Congress amended the criminal provisions of
the False Claims Act so that they explicitly piohibited
false claims against "any corporation in which the United
States of America is a stockholder." I Petitioners contend
that this amendment shows that the criminal provisions
had not previously covered government corporations.
From this they argue-relying on the rule that incorpo.Tation of a statute by reference generally does not include
subsequent amendments to that statute-that the civil
provisions, which have never been amended, also do not
cover false claims against such corporattons.
Despite -its surface plausibility this argument cannot
withstand analysis. At most, the 1918 amendment is
merely an expression of how the 1918 Congress interpreted a statute passed :y another Congress more than a
half century before. Under these circumstances such
interpretation has very little, if any, significance. Cf.
Higgins v. Smith, 308 U. S. 473, 479-480; United States
v. Stafof, 260 U. S. 477, 480. Aside from this, the language of the 1918 amendment as well as its background
indicates that Congress was primarily concerned with protecting certain government corporations, like the United
States Shiroing Board Emergency Fleet Corporation,
chartered under local laws and organized so that private
parties--could share stock ownership with the United
States. See 39 Stat. 731; United States v. Bowman, 260
U. S. 94, 101-102. Any expression of congressional opinion regarding that type of corporation is of little value in
deciding the applicability of the False Claims Act to a
o40 Stat. 1015.

wholly owned and closely controlled government instrumentality like Commodity.
None of the cases relied on by petitioner call for a
result different from the one we reach. Pierce v. United
States, 314 U. S. 306, where the Court refused to apply a
statute making criminal the impersonation of an officer
of the United States to a person posing as an officer of the
Tennessee Valley Authority, concerned another statute
enacted for other purposes. 0 Moreover, it rested in substantial part on the fact that the TVA Act specifically
listed a number of federal criminal statutes as applicable
to TVA operations but omitted the false impersonation
statute. The cases presenting questions of governmental
immunity, e. g., Keifer & Keifer v. ReconstructionFinance
Corp., 306 U. S. 381, or intragovernmental organization, e. g., United States ex rel. Skinner & Eddy Corp. v.
McCarl,275 U. S. 1, involved nothing more than a search
for congressional purpose with respect to the problems
then before the Court.
