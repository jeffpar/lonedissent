CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH

No. 83.

CIRCUIT.

Argued December 10, 1948.-Decided March 14, 1949.

In 1936 a parent corporation made a tax-free liquidation of five
of its wholly-owned subsidiaries by distributing to itself all of
their assets, subject to their liabilities, and redeeming and canceling all of their stock. At that time, one subsidiary had earnings
and profits of $90,362 accumulated since February 28, 1913, and
the other four had deficits aggregating $3,147,803. Not counting
the earnings or deficits of its subsidiaries, the parent had at the
end of that year earnings and profits of $2,129,957 accumulated
after February 28, 1913. In 1937 it had earnings of $390,387.
During 1937 the parent made a pro rata cash distribution of
$802,284 to its preferred stockholders. Held: This distribution
in its entirety was a dividend under § 115 of the Revenue Act of
1936 and constituted ordinary income. Pp. 411-421.
1. The rule of Commissioner v. Sansome, 60 F. 2d 931, is
grounded not on a theory of continuity of the corporate enterprise
but on the necessity to prevent escape of earnings and profits from
taxation. Pp. 414-417.
2. Harter v. Helvering, 79 F. 2d 12, distinguished. Pp. 417-418.
3. Under the Sansome rule, explicitly ratified by Congress, taxfree reorganizations do not disturb the status of earnings and
profits otherwise available for distribution. Pp. 418-421.
4. In this case, to allow deduction of the subsidiaries' deficits
from the parent's earnings would, in effect, recognize losses the
tax effects of which Congress has explicitly provided should be
deferred. P. 421.
167 F. 2d 117, reversed.

The Tax Court held that part of a cash distribution

to stockholders by a parent corporation which had absorbed five subsidiaries in a tax-free liquidation was not
a dividend taxable as income under § 115 of the Revenue

Act of 1936, because the accumulated earnings and profits
of the parent corporation, plus those of one of the sub-

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case involves a tax-free liquidation by a parent
corporation of some of its subsidiaries. At the time of
the liquidation the parent had earnings and profits available for distribution, and the subsidiaries had an aggregate net deficit. The issue now before us is whether
the rule of Commissioner v. Sansome, 60 F. 2d 931, requires the subtraction of the subsidiaries' deficit from
the parent's earnings and profits, in determining whether
a subsequent distribution by the parent constituted dividends or a return of capital to its stockholders.
The Sansome case, supra, arose from a tax-free reorganization in which the transferor corporation had a surplus in earnings and profits available for distribution.
It was there held that those earnings and profits, for
purposes of a subsequent distribution by the transferee
corporation to its stockholders, retain their status as
earnings or profits and are taxable to the recipients as
dividends. The rule has been held to include liquidations of a subsidiary by its parent. Robinette v. Commissioner, 148 F. 2d 513; U. S. Treas. Reg. 101, Art.

115-11, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1938 and
made retroactive, 52 Stat 447.
The facts were stipulated, and so found by the Tax
Court. So far as relevant, they are as follows: In December, 1936, Nevada-California Electric Corporation
liquidated five of its wholly-owned subsidiaries by distributing to itself all of their assets, subject to their
liabilities, and by redeeming and canceling all of their
outstanding stock. No gain or loss on the liquidation
was recognized for income tax purposes under § 112 (b)
(6) of the Revenue Act of 1936.' On the date of liquidation, one of the subsidiaries had earnings and profits
accumulated after February 28, 1913, in the amount of
$90,362.77. The four others had deficits which aggregated $3,147,803.62. On December 31, 1936, the parent
had earnings and profits accumulated after February 28,
1913, in the amount of $2,129,957.81, which amount does
not reflect the earnings or deficits of the subsidiaries.
In 1937, Nevada-California had earnings of $390,387.02.
In the years 1918 to 1933 inclusive the parent and its
subsidiaries filed consolidated income tax returns.'

Opinion of the Court.

Respondent was the owner of 2,640 shares of the preferred stock of Nevada-California. During 1937 that
corporation made a pro rata cash distribution to its preferred stockholders in the amount of $802,284, of which
respondent received $18,480. The Commissioner determined that the distribution was a dividend under § 115 of
the Revenue Act of 1936 and constituted ordinary
income in its entirety.
Of the 1937 distribution, approximately 49% was
chargeable to earnings and profits of the taxable year.
Consequently, respondent conceded in the Tax Court that
that percentage of her share, or about nine thousand
dollars, was taxable as a dividend under § 115 (a) (2).
The Tax Court held in her favor that the balance was
not a taxable dividend out of earnings and profits, on
by the parent and availed of for tax purposes prior to the liquidation.

"SEC. 115. DISTRIBUTIONS BY CORPORATIONS.
"(a) DEFINITION OF DIVIDEND.-The term 'dividend' when used in
this title (except in section 203 (a) (3) and section 207 (c) (1), relating to insurance companies) means any distribution made by a
corporation to its shareholders, whether in money or in other property, (1) out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28,
1913, or (2) out of the earnings or profits of the taxable year
(computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution
by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year), without
regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the
distribution was made.
"(b) SOURCE OF DISTRIBUTIONS.-For the purposes of this Act every
distribution is made out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof,
and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits. Any
earnings or profits accumulated, or increase in value of property
accrued, before March 1, 1913, may be distributed exempt from tax,
after the earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913,
have been distributed, but any such tax-free distribution shall be
applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock provided
in section 113." 49 Stat. 1687.

the theory that all of Nevada-California's accumulated
earnings and profits, plus the accumulated earnings and
profits of the subsidiary that had a surplus, were erased
by the aggregate deficits of the other four subsidiaries.'
8 T. C. 190. The Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided
court, 167 F. 2d 117. We brought the case here on a
writ of certiorari, 335 U. S. 807, because of its importance
in the administration of the revenue laws, and because
of an alleged conflict of the decision below with that
of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Cranson
v. United States, 146 F. 2d 871.
Commissioner v. Sansome, 60 F. 2d 931, arose thus:
A Corporation sold out all its assets to B Corporation,
both organized under the laws of New Jersey. B Corporation assumed all liabilities and issued its stock to the
stockholders of A Corporation, without change in the
proportions of their holdings. The only change was that
the charter of B Corporation gave it slightly broader powers. At the time of the reorganization, A Corporation
had on its books a large surplus and undivided profits.
The new corporation made no profit and the company
soon dissolved. The liquidating distributions in 1923, the
year when the dissolution was begun, did not exhaust the
amount of accumulated profits of the predecessor corporation, and the Commissioner contended that those distributions were taxable to the stockholders as dividends
and not, as claimed by them, as a return of capital.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with
the Commissioner, and held that since the reorganization
was nontaxable under § 202 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of
1921, the accumulated earnings and profits of the transferor retained their character as such for tax purposes
4 Respondent

agrees that the earnings and profits of the subsidiary
with a surplus become, by virtue of the Sansome rule, earnings and
profits of the parent, whatever the ultimate treatment of the deficits
of the other subsidiaries.

in the hands of the transferee and were consequently
taxable on distribution as ordinary income under § 201
of the same Act.' The view of the court was thus expressed by Judge Learned Hand: "Hence we hold that
a corporate reorganization which results in no 'gain or
loss' under section 202 (c) (2) (42 Stat: 230) does not
toll the company's life as continued venture under section
201, and that what were 'earnings or profits' of the original, or subsidiary, company remain, for purposes of
distribution, 'earnings or profits' of the successor, or
parent, in liquidation." 60 F. 2d 931, 933. The rule has
been consistently followed judicially 6 and has received
explicit Congressional approval.7
5 Section 201 of the 1921 Act specifies what corporate distributions
are taxable as dividends; § 202 (c) (2) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss from certain corporate reorganizations.

(1939-1 Cum. Bull. (part 2) 678, 690), recognized the rule of the
Sansome case, and said that the amendment made by that Act
intended no change in existing law, but was added only in the interest
of clarity. U. S. Treas. Reg. 94, Art. 115-11, promulgated under the
1936 Act, incorporates the substance of the report. The Revenue Act
of 1938 amended § 115 (h) only by extending its application to distributions of "property or money" as well as of "stock or securities"; the effect was to make § 115 (h) harmonize with § 112 (b)
(6) and (7); and Treasury Regulations 101, promulgated under the
1938 Act, was amended to conform. The Internal Revenue Code
contains the section substantially unchanged.

Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S.

The rationale of the Sansome decision as a "continued
venture" doctrine has been often repeated in the cases,
and in some of them the fact that the successor corporation has differed from the predecessor merely in identity
or form 8 has lent it plausibility. Other cases, however,
demonstrate that the "continued venture" analysis does
not accurately indicate the basis of the decisions. The
rule that earnings and profits of a corporation do not
lose their character as such by virtue of a tax-free reorganization or liquidation has been applied where more
than one corporation has been absorbed or liquidated,'
where there has been a "split-off" reorganization, ° and
where the reorganization has resulted in substantial
changes in the proprietary interests."
In Commissioner v. Munter, 331 U. S. 210, this Court
reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit which had held in favor of the taxpayer on the
ground that the ownership of the successor corporation
was so different from that of the two predecessors that
there was not sufficient continuity of the corporate entity
to apply the Sansome doctrine. The opinion of the
Court stated our unanimous view of the basis of the rule:
"A basic principle of the income tax laws has long been
the effect of tax-free distributions on earnings and profits. The
reports accompanying the bill in Congress, H. R. Rep. No. 2894,
76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 41 (1940-2 Cum. Bull. 496, 526), and S. Rep.
No. 2114, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 25 (1940-2 Cum. Bull. 528, 546547), both recognize the application of "the principle under which
the earnings and profits of the transferor by reason of the transfer
become the earnings and profits of the transferee." Ibid., p. 25.
The reports do not mention deficits.

Opinion of the Court.

that corporate earnings and profits should be taxed when
they are distributed to the stockholders who own the
distributing corporation. . . . Thus unless those earnings and profits accumulated by the predecessor corporations and undistributed in this reorganization are
deemed to have been acquired by the successor corporation and taxable upon distribution by it, they would
escape the taxation which Congress intended. . . The
congressional purpose to tax all stockholders who receive
distributions of corporate earnings and profits cannot be
frustrated by any reorganization which leaves earnings
and profits undistributed in whole or in part." 331 U. S.
at 214, 215. See Murchison's Estate v. Commissioner,
76 F. 2d 641, 642; Putnam v. United States, 149 F. 2d 721,
726; Samuel L. Slover, 6 T. C. 884, 886. We conclude
from the cases that the Sansome rule is grounded not on
a theory of continuity of the corporate enterprise but on
the necessity to prevent escape of earnings and profits
from taxation.
The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in Harter v. Helvering, 79 F. 2d 12, is not inconsistent with this view. In that case the situation was
as follows: A Corporation and B Corporation, each of
which had accumulated earnings and profits, merged to
form C Corporation. By the operation of the Sansome
rule, the earnings and profits retained their character as
such in the hands of C. Some time later, D Corporation
acquired all the stock of C, and thereafter liquidated it
in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized.
At the time of the liquidation of C Corporation, D Corporation, the parent, had a deficit in earnings and profits.
The court held, in determining the amount of earnings
and profits available to D Corporation after the liquidation for distribution as dividends, that its deficit should
be deducted from the accumulated earnings and profits
acquired from its subsidiary. It is vigorously contended

336 U. S.

that the logic of the Harter case compels the allowance
of a deduction of the deficits of the subsidiaries from
the accumulated earnings and profits of the parent. We
believe this view to be the product of inadequate analysis." The difference between the Harter situation and
the problem before us may perhaps be clarified by comparing them taxwise if neither liquidation had occurred.
Briefly stated, in the case of a distribution to a corporation with a deficit from either current or prior losses,
the corporation receiving the distribution has no taxable
income or earnings or profits available for current distribution until current income exceeds current losses, and
no accumulated earnings or profits until its actual deficit
from prior losses is erased. See 1 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (1942) § 9.30, and cases cited
therein n. 44 et seq. In the instant situation, however,
the parent did have accumulated earnings and profits
available for distribution as dividends, absent the liquidation. Congressional intent to tax such earnings and
profits on their distribution cannot be prevented by the
fact of an intervening reorganization or liquidation."
The operation of the Sansome rule on the taxation
of corporate distributions is brought into high relief by
consideration of the economic relation between a parent

corporation and its subsidiary. Congress requires that
earnings and profits, current or accumulated, be taxed
to the recipients thereof as dividends on their distribution. 4 If a subsidiary has a surplus in earnings and
profits, the parent has a choice of two methods by which
it may "realize" this surplus. It may cause the subsidiary to declare a dividend, or it may liquidate its
interest or part of its interest in the subsidiary. In the
former case, the distribution would of course be taxable
as ordinary income to the parent insofar as that distribution, plus the parent's other income, represented net
income to it. If the parent uses the second method, two
alternatives again are available: the liquidation may take
the form of a sale outright, or may be performed within
the framework of the reorganization sections of the Internal Revenue Code or its predecessor acts. If the
former, gain is of course realized, and is also recognized
for tax purposes. We note in passing, in this connection,
that such gain will correspond, if at all, only by coincidence with the amount of earnings and profits of the
subsidiary. If the latter, Congress has determined that
the gain shall not be recognized at that time, but that
such recognition shall be deferred. If the subsidiary has
a deficit in earnings and profits, the deficit may be
"realized" by the parent only by liquidation, and the
(c) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1936, the latter as amended by § 501
(a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1942, to the transferor corporation in
a tax-free reorganization. 49 Stat. 1664; 56 Stat. 798, 954. The
question of "inheritance" of a deficit was not in issue. See Green,
supra, note 12, at 341.
14 The operation of the Sansome rule is restricted, of course, to
earnings and profits which are not considered to be distributed to
its own stockholders by the transferor corporation in a tax-free reorganization. Commissioner v. Munter, 331 U. S. 210, 215-16; Samuel
L. Slover, 6 T. C. 884. Cf. U. S. Treas. Reg. 111, § 29.112 (b)
(6)-4 as to the effect of a tax-free reorganization on minority stockholders of the transferor corporation.

same two alternatives are present as when the subsidiary
has a surplus: sale, and reorganization within § 112.
Again, in the former case, loss is realized and also recognized. And in the case of a reorganization or liquidation in the framework of the Code, the recognition
of loss is deferred by Congressional mandate to a later
time.
If the assets of the parent and subsidiary are combined
via a tax-free reorganization or liquidation, the effect of
the Sansome rule is simply this: a distribution of assets
that would have been taxable as dividends absent the
reorganization or liquidation does not lose that character
by virtue of the tax-free transaction. Respondent's contention that the logic of the Sansome rule requires subtracting the deficit of the subsidiary from the earnings
and profits of the parent as a corollary of carrying over
the earnings and profits of the subsidiary has a superficial
plausibility; but the plausibility disappears when it is
noted that the taxpayer would thus obtain an advantage taxwise that would not be available absent the
liquidation, since there is no way to "declare" a deficit,
and thus no method of loss realization open to the parent
parallel to a declaration of dividends as a mode of realizing the profits of a subsidiary.
It is urged upon us that the deficits of the subsidiaries
should be subtracted from the earnings and profits of
the parent in order to make the tax consequences of the
liquidation correspond with corporate accounting practice. The answer is brief. The Sansome rule itself, as
applied to earnings and profits, has never been thought
to be controlled by ordinary corporate accounting concepts; its uniform effect is to treat for tax purposes as
earnings or profits assets which are properly considered
capital for many if not most corporate purposes, and
it has long been a commonplace of tax law that similar

divergences often occur. See Commissioner v. Wheeler,
324 U. S. 542, 546; Putnam v. United States, 149 F. 2d
721, 726; 1 Mertens, op. cit. § 9.33; Rudick, op. cit. 878906.15
Congress has expressed its purpose to tax all stockholders who receive distributions of earnings and profits.
In order to facilitate simplification of corporate financial
structures, it has further provided that certain intercorporate transactions shall be free of immediate tax consequences to the corporations. There has been judicially
superimposed by the Sansome rule, with the subsequent
explicit ratification of Congress, the doctrine that taxfree reorganizations shall not disturb the status of earnings and profits otherwise available for distribution.
Nevada-California at the time of the 1937 distribution to
respondent had such earnings and profits. Since we believe that to allow deduction from these earnings of the
deficits of its subsidiaries would be in effect to recognize
losses the tax effects of which Congress has explicitly
provided should be deferred, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is reversed.
Reversed.

concurs in the result.

15 On the merits, respondent's argument is not convincing. It
fails to take into account the difference between the concept of
surplus or deficit, which is a summary of the operations of the
corporation reporting it, and the concept of gain or loss, which
reports the effect of the tax-free transaction itself. So various are
the possible permutations and combinations of the economic factors
that equivalence of surplus or deficit in the accounts of the subsidiary with the gain or loss to the parent would be mere coincidence.
Consider for example the case where a corporation acquires all the
stock of another which at the time has a large deficit. If the subsidiary is soon liquidated, the deficit will still be large, and the parent
may realize little or no loss on the liquidation. See the first two
texts cited note 12, supra.
