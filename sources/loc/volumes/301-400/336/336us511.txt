FARRELL v. UNITED STATES

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 267.

Argued January 14, 1949.-Decided April 4, 1949.

1. A seaman serving on a merchant vessel, owned and operated by the
United States in wartime and docked at a conquered port in the
war area, was injured while returning to the ship after overstaying shore leave. He was treated in government hospitals untii
discharged as completely disabled. There was no possibility of
further cure, although medical attention might be required from
time to time to relieve recurring conditions. Held: The liability
for maintenance and cure does not extend beyond the time when the
maximum cure possible has been effected, and petitioner is not
entitled to maintenance so long as he is disabled or for life.
Pp. 512-519.
2. The ship's articles which petitioner signed provided for a foreign
voyage from the United States and return and for a term "not
exceeding" twelve months. Held: He was entitled to wages only
until the completion of the voyage and not for twelve months from
the date of signing. Pp. 519-521.
167 F. 2d 781, affirmed.

In a suit in admiralty by petitioner against the United
States and others, the District Court awarded petitioner
less than the amounts he had claimed for maintenance
and cure and for wages. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner, a seaman, brought suit in admiralty to recover damages under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46
U. S. C. ยง 688, and maintenance, cure and wages under
maritime law. The issue of negligence was decided
against him by both courts below and the claim is abandoned here. Petition for certiorari to review other issues
was granted. 335 U. S. 869.

MAINTENANCE AND CURE.

The facts which occasion maintenance and cure for this
seaman are not in dispute. The claimant, 22 years of
age and in good health, was a member of the Merchant
Marine. He was in the service of the S. S. James E. Haviland, a merchant vessel owned and operated by the United
States as a cargo and troop ship. On February 5, 1944,
she was docked at Palermo, Sicily, and Farrell was granted
shore leave which required his return to the ship by 6
p. m. of the same day. He overstayed his leave and
about eight o'clock began, in rain and darkness, to make
his way to the ship. He became lost and was misdirected
to the wrong gate, by which he entered the shore-front
area about a mile from where the ship lay moored. The
area generally was blacked out but petitioner's companion, forty or fifty feet away, saw him fall over a guard
chain into a drydock which was lighted sufficiently for
night work then in progress. Farrell was grievously
injured.
He was treated without expense to himself in various
government hospitals until June 30, 1944, when he was

discharged at Norfolk, Virginia, as completely disabled.
He is totally and permanently blind and suffers posttraumatic convulsions which probably will become more
frequent and are without possibility of further cure.
From time to time he will require some medical care to
ease attacks of headaches and epileptic convulsions. The
court below concluded that the duty of a shipowner to
furnish maintenance and cure does not extend beyond the
time when the maximum cure possible has been effected.
Petitioner contends that he is entitled to maintenance as
long as he is disabled, which in this case is for life.
Admittedly there is no authority in any statute or
American admiralty decisions for the proposition that he
is entitled to maintenance for life. But an argument is
based upon the ancient authority of Cleirac, Jugmens
d'Oleron, Arts. 6 and 7 and notes by Cleirac; Consolato
del Mare, cc. 182, 137; 2 Pard Coll. Mar. 152; to which
American authorities have paid considerable respect. See
Story, Circuit Justice, in Reed v. Canfield, Fed. Cas. No.
11,641, p. 429. A translation of the note relied upon
reads:
"If in defending himself, or fighting against an enemy
or corsairs, a mariner is maimed, or disabled to serve
on board a ship for the rest of his life, besides the
charge of his cure, he shall be maintained as long as
he lives at the cost of the ship and cargo. Vide the
Hanseatic law, art. 35." 1 Peters' Admiralty Decisions (1807), Appendix, p. xv.
Article 35 of the Laws of the Hanse Towns referred to
reads:
"ART. xxxv. The seamen are obliged to defend
their ship against rovers, on pain of losing their
wages; and if they are wounded, they shall be healed
and cured at the general charge of the concerned in

a common average. If anyone of them is maimed
and disabled, he shall be maintained as long as he
lives by a like average." Ibid., p. civ.
We need not elaborate upon the meanings or weight
to be given to these medieval pronouncements of maritime law. As they show, they were written when pirates
were not operatic characters but were real-life perils of
the sea. When they bore down on a ship, all was lost
unless the seaman would hazard life and limb in desperate
defense. If they saved the ship and cargo, it was something in the nature of salvage and for their sacrifice
in the effort a contribution on principles of average may
have been justly due. Perhaps more than humanitarian
considerations, inducement to stand by the ship generated the doctrine that saving the ship and her cargo
from pirates entitles the seaman to lifelong maintenance
if he is disabled in the struggle.
But construe the old-time law with what liberality we
will, it cannot be made to cover the facts of this case.
This ship was not beset but was snug at berth in a harbor
that had capitulated to the United States and her allied
forces six months before. No sea rovers, pirates or corsairs appeared to have menaced her. It is true that the
ship was engaged in warlike operations and was a legitimate target for enemy aircraft or naval vessels, which
made her service a war risk, but at that time and place
no enemy attack was in progress or imminent. Even
if we pass all this and assume the ship always to have
been in potential danger and in need of defense, this
seaman at the time of his injury had taken leave of her
and he is in no position to claim that he was a sacrifice to
her salvation. Far from helping to man the ship at the
moment, he was unable to find her; he was lost ashore
and not able adequately to take care of himself. However patriotic his motive in enlisting in the service and

FARRELL v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

however ready he may have been to risk himself for his
country, we can find no rational basis for awarding lifetime maintenance against the ship on the theory that
he was wounded or maimed while defending her against
enemies.
It is claimed, however, even if the basis for a lifetime
award does not exist, that he is entitled to maintenance
and cure beyond the period allowed by the courts below.
This is based largely upon statements in the opinion
of the Court in Calmar Steamship Corp. v. Taylor, 303
U. S. 525. There the question as stated by the Court
was whether the duty of a shipowner to provide maintenance and cure for a seaman falling ill of an incurable
disease while in its employ, extends to the payment of
a lump-sum award sufficient to defray the cost of maintenance and cure for the remainder of his life. The
Court laid aside cases where incapacity is caused by the
employment and said, "We can find no basis for saying
that, if the disease proves to be incurable, the duty extends beyond a fair time after the voyage in which to
effect such improvement in the seaman's condition as
reasonably may be expected to result from nursing, care,
and medical treatment. This would satisfy such demands of policy as underlie the imposition of the obligation. Beyond this we think there is no duty, at least
where the illness is not caused by the seaman's service."
It is claimed that when the Court reserved or disclaimed any judgment as to cases where the incapacity
is caused "by the employment" or "by the seaman's
service" it recognized or created such cases as a separate
class for a different measure of maintenance and cure.
We think no such distinction exists or was premised
in the Calmar case. In Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318
U. S. 724, the Court pointed out that logically and historically the duty of maintenance and cure derives from

OCTOBER TERM, 1948.
Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S.

a seaman's dependence on his ship, not from his individual deserts, and arises from his disability, not from
anyone's fault. We there refused to look to the personal
nature of the seaman's activity at the moment of injury
to determine his right to award. Aside from gross misconduct or insubordination, what the seaman is doing
and why and how he sustains injury does not affect his
right to maintenance and cure, however decisive it may
be as to claims for indemnity or for damages for negligence. He must, of course, at the time be "in the service
of the ship," by which is meant that he must be generally
answerable to its call to duty rather than actually in
performance of routine tasks or specific orders.
It has been the merit of the seaman's right to maintenance and cure that it is so inclusive as to be relatively
simple, and can be understood and administered without
technical considerations. It has few exceptions or conditions to stir contentions, cause delays, and invite litigations. The seaman could forfeit the right only by
conduct whose wrongful quality even simple men of the
calling would recognize-insubordination, disobedience to
orders, and gross misconduct. On the other hand, the
master knew he must maintain and care for even the
erring and careless seaman, much as a parent would a
child. For any purpose to introduce a graduation of
rights and duties based on some relative proximity of
the activity at time of injury to the "employment" or
the "service of the ship," would alter the basis and be
out of harmony with the spirit and function of the doctrine and would open the door to the litigiousness which
has made the landman's remedy so often a promise to
the ear to be broken to the hope.
Nor is it at all clear to us what this particular litigant
could gain from introduction of the distinction for which
contention is made. If we should concede that larger

Opinion of the Court.

measure of maintenance is due those whose injury is
caused by the nature of their employment, it would seem
farfetched to hold it applicable here. Claimant was disobedient to his orders and for his personal purposes
overstayed his shore leave. His fall into a drydock that
was sufficiently lighted for workmen to be carrying on
repairs to a ship therein was due to no negligence but
his own. These matters have not been invoked to forfeit
or reduce his usual seaman's right, but it is difficult to
see how such circumstances would warrant enlargement
of it. We hold that he is entitled to the usual measure
of maintenance and cure at the ship's expense, no less
and no more, and turn to ascertainment of its bounds.
The law of the sea is in a peculiar sense an international
law, but application of its specific rules depends upon
acceptance by the United States. The problem of the
sick or injured seaman has concerned every maritime
country and, in 1936, the General Conference of the
International Labor Organization at Geneva submitted
a draft convention to the United States and other states.
It was ratified by the Senate and was proclaimed by
the President as effective for the United States on October
29, 1939. 54 Stat. 1693. Article 4, paragraph 1, thereof,
provides: "The shipowner shall be liable to defray the
expense of medical care and maintenance until the sick
or injured person has been cured, or until the sickness or
incapacity has been declared of a permanent character."
While enactment of this general rule by Congress
would seem controlling, it is not amiss to point out that
the limitation thus imposed was in accordance with the
understanding of those familiar with the laws of the
sea and sympathetic with the seaman's problems.
The Department of Labor issued a summary of the
Convention containing the following on this subject:
"The shipowner is required to furnish medical care and

maintenance, including board and lodging, until the disabled person has been cured or the disability has been
declared permanent." Robinson, Admiralty, p. 300.
Representatives of the organized seamen have recognized and advised Congress of this traditional limitation
on maintenance and cure. When Congress has had under
consideration substitution of a system of workmen's compensation on the principles of the Longshoremen's and
Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1424, as
amended, 33 U. S. C. ยงยง 901-950, organized seamen, as
we have heretofore noted, have steadfastly opposed the
change. Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 328 U. S.
707, 715. In doing so the legal representative of one
maritime union advised the Committee on Merchant
Marine of the House of Representatives that maintenance extended during "(a) the period that a seaman
receives treatment at a hospital either as an in-patient
or an out-patient; and (b) during a period of convalescence, and until the maximum cure is obtained."'
Another representative, after defining it to include hospitalization, said, "In addition a seaman is entitled to
recover maintenance while outside of the hospital until
his physical condition becomes fixed." '
That the duty of the ship to maintain and care for
the seaman after the end of the voyage only until he
was so far cured as possible, seems to have been the
doctrine of the American admiralty courts prior to the
adoption of the Convention by Congress,' despite occasional ambiguity of language or reservation as to possible

situations not before the court. It has been the rule
of admiralty courts since the Convention
Maintenance and cure is not the only recourse of the
injured seaman. In an appropriate case he may obtain
indemnity or compensation for injury due to negligence
or unseaworthiness and may recover, by trial before court
and jury, damages for partial or total disability. But
maintenance and cure is more certain if more limited
in its benefits. It does not hold a ship to permanent
liability for a pension, neither does it give a lump-sum
payment to offset disability based on some conception
of expectancy of life. Indeed the custom of providing
maintenance and cure in kind and concurrently with its
need has had the advantage of removing its benefits from
danger of being wasted by the proverbial improvidence
of its beneficiaries. The Government does not contend
that if Farrell receives future treatment of a curative
nature he may not recover in a new proceeding the
amount expended for such treatment and for maintenance while receiving it.
The need of this seaman for permanent help is great
and his plight most unfortunate. But as the evidence
has afforded no basis for supplying that need by finding
negligence, neither does the case afford a basis for distortion of the doctrine of maintenance and cure. This
seaman was in the service of the United States and extraordinary measures of relief while not impossible are
not properly addressed to the courts.
II. WAGES.

to wages until the completion of the voyage at the port

of New York on March 28, 1944. The petitioner contends that he has a right to wages for twelve months from
December 16, 1943, the date he joined the vessel. The
articles of the Haviland, signed by petitioner, were on
a printed form which left a vacant space subject to the
following footnote: "Here the voyage is to be described,
and the places named at which the ship is to touch;
or, if that cannot be done, the general nature and probable length of the voyage is to be stated, and the port
or country at which the voyage is to terminate." The
Haviland's articles, for security reasons during the war,
did not describe the voyage in such terms but provided,
"from the Port of Philadelphia, to A point in the Atlantic Ocean to the eastward of Phila. and thence to such
ports and places in any part of the world as the Master
may direct or as may be ordered or directed by the United
States Government or any department, commission or
agency thereof . . . and back to a final port of discharge

in the United States, for a term of time not exceeding
12 (Twelve) calendar months." It is not questioned that
the general custom in ships, other than the coastwise
trade, is to sign on for a voyage rather than for a fixed
period. But it is contended that the last clause of this
contract obligated the petitioner to serve for twelve calendar months, irrespective of the termination of the
voyage, and therefore gave him the right to wages for a
similar period. The contract is not an uncommon form
and complied with war-time requirements as to voyage
contracts.5 We think, in the light of the custom of the
industry and the condition of the times, there is nothing
ambiguous about it and that it obligated the petitioner
only for the voyage on which the ship was engaged when
he signed on and that, when it terminated at a port of

discharge in the United States, he could not have been
required to reimbark for a second voyage. The twelvemonth period appears as a limitation upon the duration
of the voyage and not as a stated period of employment.
We think the court below made no error in determining
the wages.

I. Wages.-The articles bound Farrell to a voyage on
the vessel which was en route to "a point in the Atlantic
Ocean to the eastward of Phila. and thence to such ports
and places in any part of the world as the Master may
direct or as may be ordered or directed by the United
States Government or any department, commission or
agency thereof . . . and back to a final port of discharge
in the United States, for a term of time not exceeding
12 (Twelve) calendar months." If this were a coastwise voyage, there would be little question that Farrell
could recover his wages for the entire twelve-month period. See Enochasson v. Freeport Sulphur Co., 7 F. 2d
675; Jones v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 155 F. 2d 992, 996.
I agree with Judge Kirkpatrick that the principle of
those cases is likewise applicable to foreign voyages.
Shields v. United States, 73 F. Supp. 862, 866. Any difference is not apparent. In each the seaman binds himself for the period. The obligations to pay wages should
be coterminous with that responsibility. Enochasson v.
Freeport Sulphur Co., supra. The number of voyages
made is therefore immaterial. It is the extent of the
voyage that could be demanded that is controlling.

II. Maintenance and Cure.-Calmar S. S. Corp. V.
Taylor, 303 U. S. 525, involved maintenance and cure'
for an incurable disease which manifested itself during
the seaman's employment but was not caused by it.
The Court held that the shipowner's liability ended when
the seaman was cured as far as possible, reserving the
question whether a different rule would apply if the
incapacity arose from the employment. P. 530. The
question reserved is now presented, for an injury received
on returning to a ship from shore leave is plainly incurred
in the service. Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U. S. 724;
Reed v. Canfield, Fed. Cas. No. 11,641. Justice Story was
of the view that the ship remained liable until the cure
was completed. Reed v. Canfield, supra. That was in
1832. Intervening decisions in the lower courts qualified
that view. It was held that the right to maintenance
and cure extended to a reasonable time beyond the end
of the voyage.' The problem of what was a reasonable
time remained. The test adopted by the Court is that
it extends through the period when the maximum cure
within the reach of medical science has been achieved.
But that test is not sufficiently discriminating.
Even though a maximum cure has been effected, two
entirely different states of being may result when the
injured man is left totally disabled.
(1) He may be totally disabled but no longer in need
of medical aid to care for the condition created by the
injury nor without means of providing maintenance.
That is not the present case, at least so far as medical
care is concerned. And we need not determine what
rights to maintenance and cure one so situated has.

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

(2) One injured in the service of a ship may not only
be permanently disabled after reaching the point of maximum cure. He may also be in need of future medical
aid to sustain that condition and be without means of
maintenance. These needs may extend to end of life.
That is the present case, at least so far as medical care
is concerned.3 In this situation payments to give continuing needed care of wounds have been allowed, even
though a maximum cure has been effected. The Josephine & Mary, 120 F. 2d 459, 462, 464. Cf. Saunders v.
Luckenbach Co., 262 F. 845, 847.
In the present case an award for maintenance and cure
to cover a six-month period after discharge from the hospital was allowed. Nevertheless even though Farrell's
expenses of care may be continuing, the district court
judge refused any further award. I do not believe that
these future expenses should be any less a charge on the
ship than past expenses. To conclude as the Court now
does that they are not is to ignore in part the salutary
policy supporting the doctrine of maintenance and cure.
Maintenance and cure is an ancient doctrine. It reflects in part the concern which the state has had from
an early date in a poor and improvident class of workers.
See Mr. Justice Story in Harden v. Gordon, Fed. Cas. No.
6,047. It also recognizes the imperative necessity of the
nation to maintain in peace and war a merchant marine.
3 The District Court said:
"He will continue to have these spells and to have pain in the area
of the fracture. He will need treatment and medical care from time
to time and probably some care for the rest of his life. He was
always a healthy individual before his accident and never showed
any signs of epilepsy before then. The medical testimony also shows
that his condition of blindness is permanent, that in all likelihood his
convulsive attacks will continue, and possibly become more frequent,
and without any possibility of a further cure. The attacks and
headaches mentioned will require some care from time to time whenever they persist."

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

336 U. S.

If men are to go down to the sea in ships and face the
perils of the ocean, those who employ them must be
solicitous of their welfare. Maintenance and cure is an
inducement on the part of masters and owners to be
solicitous of the health, safety, and welfare of seamen
while they are in the service. It gives a degree of security, though injury or sickness be incurred. It gives
service in the merchant marine a dignity equal to the
important function it performs. It reflects "the great
public policy of preserving this important class of citizens
for the commercial service and maritime defence of the
nation." Id. at p. 483.
Accordingly, the injuries of seamen arising out of the
service were made a charge against the enterprise to the
extent at least of maintenance and cure. Their maintenance and cure was indeed part of the cost of the business. It is nonetheless a legitimate cost though the
expense continues beyond the time when a maximum
cure has been effected.4

4 The

Shipowners' Liability Convention of 1936, 54 Stat. 1693, does
not require a contrary result. Article 4, paragraph 1, provides:
"The shipowner shall be liable to defray the expense of medical

care and maintenance until the sick or injured person has been cured,
or until the sickness or incapacity has been declared of a permanent
character."
But Art. 12 contains a power to depart from that standard in this
type of case. It provides:
"Nothing in this Convention shall affect any law, award, custom
or agreement between shipowners and seamen which ensures more
favourable conditions than those provided by this Convention."
