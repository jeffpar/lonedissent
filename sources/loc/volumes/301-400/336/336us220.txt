AL. v. FAMILY

SECURITY LIFE INSURANCE CO.

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

No. 297.

Argued February 2, 1949.-Decided February 28, 1949.

1. As applied in this case, a South Carolina statute forbidding life
insurance companies and their agents to engage in the undertaking
business and forbidding undertakers to serve as agents for life
insurance companies does not contravene the Due Process or Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 220-225.
2. That an "insurance lobby" may have secured the enactment of
the statute has no bearing on its constitutionality. P. 224.
3. It cannot be said that South Carolina is not entitled to call the
funeral insurance business an evil nor that the statute has no
relation to such an evil. Pp. 224-225.
79 F. Supp. 62, reversed.

A three-judge federal district court enjoined enforcement of a South Carolina statute forbidding a combination of the life insurance and undertaking businesses, on
the ground that it contravened the Due Process and Equal
Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 79
F. Supp. 62. On direct appeal to this Court, reversed,
p. 225.
David W. Robinson argued the cause for appellants.
With him on the brief were John M. Daniel, Attorney
General of South Carolina, T. C. Callison, J. Monroe
Fulmer, Assistant Attorneys General, Edgar A. Brown,
Nathaniel A. Turner and R. Hoke Robinson.
Donald Russell argued the cause for appellees. With

Court in the Eastern District of South Carolina, seeking
an injunction forbidding the enforcement of the statute.

provide that due process of law and equal protection

to the Constitution of the United States. A permanent

lina Attorney General has appealed to this Court. 28
U. S. C. § 380, now 28 U. S. C. §§ 1253, 2281.
The respondent insurance company is incorporated and
licensed to do business in South Carolina, and conforms
with the comprehensive code of insurance regulations established by Act No. 232, S. C. Acts of 1947, p. 322. The
other respondents are its officers and directors. It issues life insurance with cash benefits ranging from $125
to $750. The amount of outstanding policies had reached
a total of $838,375 in May of 1948, compared to nothing
in February of the same year. Most of the company's
agents are undertakers. Parties to the insurance contract
contemplate use of the policy's proceeds to pay funeral
expenses. A "facility of payment" clause might justify
payment of proceeds to an undertaker for the insured's
funeral. At the time of the trial, respondent company
was the only concern in South Carolina selling "funeral
insurance" as an established practice.
For many years South Carolina has prohibited the
payment of insurance proceeds in merchandise or services.
Act No. 205, S. C. Acts of 1929, p. 234; S. C. Code of
1942, § 7984; Act No. 232, S. C. Acts of 1947, § 65, p. 350.
Possibilities of fraud, misunderstanding in valuation, and
the comparatively useless character of the merchandise
delivered or services rendered make respondents readily
concede the desirability of this ban. Other states have
similar statutes.2
The South Carolina legislature might well have concluded that funeral insurance, although paid in cash, carries the same evils that are present in policies payable in
merchandise or services: the beneficiary's tendency to
deliver the policy's proceeds to the agent-undertaker for
whatever funeral the money will buy, whether or not an

Opinion of the Court.

expensive ceremony is consistent with the needs of the
survivors.3 Considerations which might have been influential include the likelihood of overreach on the part
of insurance companies, and the possibilities of monopoly
control detailed in affidavits introduced in the court
below.
The South Carolina legislature is not alone in seeing
evils in this kind of insurance, and in invoking its police
powers to combat them. See the similar provisions
in N. Y. Insurance Law, § 165 (c); Fla. Stat. (1941),
§ 639.02; Ga. Code Ann. § 56-9920; Page's Ohio General
Code, § 666 (1946) (see Robbins v. Hennessey, 86 Ohio
St. 181, 99 N. E. 319); Md. Ann. Code, Art. 48A, § 110
(1939). And see the summary of critical arguments in
Business Week, October 20, 1945, pp. 48, 51.
Yet the court below held that the statute is "arbitrary
and discriminative and designed to destroy, and will
destroy, the plaintiff insurance company and its business . . . ." "It seems obvious from the record that this
legislation had its genesis in the desire of the existing
insurance companies to eliminate the plaintiff company
as a competitor. . . ." 79 F. Supp. at 70, 65. Th'e
court found that the respondent's policies are actuarially
sound; that funeral insurance is desirable; and that the
other South Carolina insurance regulations are "ample"
to correct any evils resulting from respondents' business.
S"You come to the place of business, the mortuary, to pay it.
Month in and month out. The inducement for a funeral director to
align himself with this is the fact that it will freeze this business to
him. He doesn't have to, let me hasten to say. You don't have
to call that funeral director, but if he continuously beats a path
to his door to pay his insurance, there is no question about it that
if he has any decent employees, they are going to convince the man
the thing to do is to come to them. Now, is that a healthy situation?" Proceedings of the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee,

OCTOBER TERM, 1948.
Opinion of the Court.

336 U. S.

The Court concluded that the statute now before us is
so unreasonable that it offends the Due Process Clause.
First. It is said that the "insurance lobby" obtained
this statute from the South Carolina legislature. But a
judiciary must judge by results, not by the varied factors
which may have determined legislators' votes. We cannot undertake a search for motive in testing constitutionality. See Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, overruled in United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100. Compare
Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, and United
States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, with Sunshine
Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381, 393. Compare United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, with Steward
Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 592, and Cincinnati
Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U. S. 308.
Second. Despite evidence to the contrary, respondents
see no evil to be corrected by this legislation. We are
asked to agree with respondents and call the statute
arbitrary and unreasonable.
Looking through the form of this plea to its essential
basis, we cannot fail to recognize it as an argument for
invalidity because this Court disagrees with the desirability of the legislation. We rehearse the obvious when
we say that our function is thus misconceived. We are
not equipped to decide desirability; and a court cannot
eliminate measures which do not happen to suit its tastes
if it seeks to maintain a democratic system. The forum
for the correction of ill-considered legislation is a responsive legislature.
We cannot say that South Carolina is not entitled to
call the funeral insurance business an evil. Nor can we
say that the statute has no relation to the elimination of
those evils. There our inquiry must stop.'
4 Our

deference to the legislative judgment is particularly pronounced in a field as traditionally well regulated as insurance. See

DANIEL v. FAMILY INS. CO.
220

Opinion of the Court.

This rationale did not find expression in Liggett Co. v.
Baldridge, 278 U. S. 105, on which respondents rely.
According to the majority in Liggett, "a state cannot,
'under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily interfere with private business or prohibit lawful occupations
or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon
them.' " 278 U. S. at 113. But a pronounced shift of
emphasis since the Liggett case has deprived the words
"unreasonable" and "arbitrary" of the content for which
respondents contend. See Lincoln Federal Labor Union
v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525, where
the cases are reviewed.
The Liggett case, however, was concerned with a statute
far different from the one we are considering now. Pennsylvania required drug store owners to be licensed pharmacists. Because the statute was directed at owners, who
might have no connection with the pharmaceutical
branches of modern drug stores, a divided Court thought
the measure unreasonable. The Pennsylvania statute
was clearly less adapted to the recognized evil than the
provision now before us. The Liggett case, on its facts,
is not authority for the invalidation of the South Carolina
Mortuary Act.
The South Carolina statute, on its face, does not contravene the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Neither does it offend the Amendment as applied to these
respondents.' We reverse the judgment below.
Reversed.
Osborn v. Ozlin, 310 U. S. 53, 65, 66; La Tourette v. McMaster,
248 U. S. 465, 467, 468; Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328
U. S. 408, 416, n. 13.
5 That respondent company is the only concern now affected by
the statute does not, of course, mean a denial of equal protection.
The statute is drawn in general terms; the company's success might
well induce others to enter the business. See the dissenting opinion below, 79 F. Supp. at 73, 74. And see Mason v. Missouri, 179
U. S. 328.
