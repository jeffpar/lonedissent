DEFENSE SUPPLIES CORP. ET AL. v. LAWRENCE
WAREHOUSE CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 298.

Argued February 3, 1949.-Decided April 18, 1949.

The Joint Resolution of June 30, 1945, 59 Stat. 310, dissolved the
Defense Supplies Corporation (D. S. C.) as of July 1, 1945, transferred all of its functions, assets and liabilities to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (R. F. C.), and provided that no suit
by or against D. S. C. should abate by reason thereof but that
R. F. C. might be substituted as a party at any time within
twelve months after the date of enactment. In a suit brought
by D. S. C. against respondents before its dissolution, a federal
district court entered judgment in its favor less than twelve months
after enactment of the Resolution. On an appeal noted before,
but argued and decided after, expiration of the twelve months,
the Court of Appeals affirmed, although the R. F. C. had not been
substituted as plaintiff. On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals
denied a motion to substitute I. F. C., vacated its judgment of
affirmance, and remanded the cause to the District Court with
instructions to dismiss the action. Held: Judgment of the Court
of Appeals vacated and cause remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the appeal. Pp. 632-640.
1. The motion to substitute R. F. C. after expiration of the
twelve months was out of time. P. 636.
2. The District Court's judgment, having been entered within
twelve months after passage of the Resolution, was valid when
entered. Pp. 636-637.
3. The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to review the
merits of the cause, since respondents called for review after the
period allowed for substitution had expired. P. 638.
4. The judgment of the District Court was not robbed of its
vitality by the abatement of the appellate proceedings. P. 638.
5. That the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to review the
merits does not affect the power of this Court to set aside the
erroneous action of the Court of Appeals. P. 639.

168 F. 2d 199, vacated and remanded.

Within a year after passage of the Joint Resolution of
June 30, 1945, 59 Stat. 310, a federal district court entered
a judgment for Defense Supplies Corporation in a suit
for damages instituted before passage of the Joint Resolution. 67 F. Supp. 16. On an appeal argued and decided more than a year after passage of the Joint Resolution, the Court of Appeals affirmed, although R. F. C.
had not been substituted as plaintiff. 164 F. 2d 773.
On reconsideration, the Court of Appeals denied a motion
to substitute R. F. C., vacated the judgment entered in
favor of Defense Supplies Corporation, and ordered the
action dismissed. 168 F. 2d 199. This Court granted
certiorari. 335 U. S. 857. Judgment of the Court of
Appeals vacated with directions to dismiss the appeal.

tion Finance Corporation. Both are arms of the United
States Government.'
Defense Supplies Corporation brought action against
respondents in the District Court for the Northern District of California, in February, 1944, alleging respondents' negligent destruction of automobile tires owned by
Defense Supplies and stored by respondents. Respondents denied their negligence. The District Judge tried
the cause without a jury in February, 1945. He ordered
the case submitted on July 16, 1945, and in January,
1946, found negligence and ordered judgment for Defense
Supplies Corporation in the amount of $41,975.15 and
costs, 67 F. Supp. 16; engrossed findings and final judgment were entered in April, 1946. Respondents filed
notice of appeal on June 14, 1946; the appeal was argued
in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in October,
1947, and in December the court affirmed the judgment
below. 164 F. 2d 773. In January, 1948, rehearing was
denied.
Then respondents discovered that Defense Supplies
Corporation "did not exist." Congress had dissolved the
theretofore successful litigant as of July 1, 1945, by the
Joint Resolution of June 30, 1945, 59 Stat. 310, and
transferred all its assets to the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation-after trial, but before judgment, in the
District Court. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, granted respondents' second petition for reconsideration; denied a motion to substitute the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation as out of time; and vacated the
judgment entered in favor of the Defense Supplies Corporation, ordering the action dismissed. 168 F. 2d 199.
We brought the case here on certiorari, 335 U. S. 857,
because of alleged conflict with Gaynor v. Metals Reserve

Co., 166 F. 2d 1011, in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit.
Our decision rests upon interpretation of the statute
dissolving Defense Supplies Corporation. For although
our conception of a corporation centers upon legislative
grant rather than spontaneous existence, see Petrogradsky
M. K. Bank v. National City Bank, 253 N. Y. 23, 30-31,
170 N. E. 479, 481-482, the courts have generally treated
a corporation's demise much as they have that of a natural litigant. Mumma v. Potomac Co., 8 Pet. 281, 287;
National Bank v. Colby, 21 Wall. 609; Pendleton v. Russell, 144 U. S. 640; Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, 273 U. S. 257. The parallel has not been the subject of universal admiration, see Marcus, Suability of
Dissolved Corporations, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 675; and is
by no means exact, Shayne v. Evening Post Publishing
Co., 168 N. Y. 70, 78, 61 N. E. 115, 117; Bruun v. Katz
Drug Co., 351 Mo. 731, 173 S. W. 2d 906. But at
least one facet of the analogy has seemed too clear to
permit change without an "independent lift of power"2
from the Congress. Whether phrased in terms of adherence to precedent, congressional acceptance of that precedent,' or the "impossibility" of proceeding "without a
defendant,"' most courts have held that the dissolution
of a corporation works an abatement of pending actions.'
But a time-honored feature of the corporate device is
that a corporate entity may be utterly dead for most

actions. All that is necessary is a statute so providing.
Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, supra; Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., 243 U. S. 273, 277. Unless
the statutory terms are observed, however, the consequences of total dissolution attach, and, if we follow
Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, supra,and cases
cited, the actions abate.
The controlling statute is set out in full in the margin.' The first section dissolves several Government
,"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, all functions, powers, duties, and
authority of the corporations hereinafter designated, are hereby transferred, together with all their documents, books of account, records,
assets, and liabilities of every kind "and nature, to Reconstruction
Finance Corporation and shall be performed, exercised, and administered by that Corporation in the same manner and to the same
extent and effect as if originally vested in Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, and the designated corporations are hereby dissolved:
Defense Plant Corporation, Metals Reserve Company, Rubber Reserve Company, and Defense Supplies Corporation, created by Reconstruction Finance Corporation pursuant to the Act of June 25,
1940 (54 Stat. 572), and Disaster Loan Corporation, created by
the Act of February 11, 1937 (50 Stat. 19), are hereby designated
as the corporations to which this joint resolution applies.
"SEc. 2. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall assume and
be subject to all liabilities, whether arising out of contract or otherwise, of the corporations dissolved by this joint resolution. No suit,
action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against any
of such corporations shall abate by reason of the enactment of this
joint resolution, but the court, on motion or supplemental petition
filed at any time within twelve months after the date of such enactment, showing a necessity for the survival of such suit, action, or
other proceeding to obtain a determination of the questions involved,
may allow the same to be maintained by or against the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation.

corporations, including Defense Supplies, and transfers
all their assets and authority to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Section 2 provides that "no suit,
action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or
against any of such corporations shall abate . . ., but the
court, on motion or supplemental petition filed at any
time within twelve months after" July 1, 1945, showing
necessity for survival, "may allow the same to be maintained by or against" Reconstruction Finance. The question presented now is whether the failure to substitute
by July 1, 1946, deprives petitioner Defense Supplies Corporation of its $42,000 judgment.
First. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the
motion to substitute Reconstruction Finance was out of
time. The statute provides for substitution during the
year after July 1, 1945, and Reconstruction Finance's motion was presented to the court below on March 2, 1948.
We do not think Congress intended a gesture of futility
when it stated a twelve-month period for substitution.
Second. But the court read the substitution provision
as conditioning the action's continuance: unless Reconstruction Finance became the litigant, the action abated.
It therefore held that the District Court was without
jurisdiction to enter judgment for Defense Supplies after
July 1, 1945, and vacated the judgment so entered.
We disagree. The statute states categorically that "no
action shall abate." Following that command, provision is made for substituting Reconstruction Finance.
If Reconstruction Finance is not substituted within one
year, the action by or against Defense Supplies is, of
course, at an end and the parties are left in statu quo;
but there is nothing to show that during the year in
which Reconstruction Finance may be substituted, action by or against Defense Supplies cannot continue in
Defense Supplies' name. If Congress states that no ac-

tion shall abate, we fail to see why we should make additional language a proviso. And since the District Court
entered its judgment during the year allowed for substitution of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, we
conclude that it was valid when entered.
The Court of Appeals thought that LeCrone v. McAdoo, 253 U. S. 217; Payne v. IndustrialBoard, 258 U. S.
613; and United States ex rel. Claussen v. Curran, 276
U. S. 590, dictated a contrary result. They do not. They
rather demonstrate the validity of our interpretation.
The statutory language construed in the LeCrone and
Payne cases was substantially the same as that under
scrutiny now, 7 and the court held only that the actions
were "at an end" in this court after the year given for
substitution had expired-that after that year, we had
no jurisdiction to review the merits. The court did not
suggest that the courts below had entered their judgments improperly. It simply dismissed the writs of error.8 But in 1925 the statute was amended. The
'"Be it enacted . . . That no suit, action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of any Department or Bureau
or other officer of the United States in his official capacity, or in
relation to the discharge of his official duties, shall abate by reason
of his death, or the expiration of his term of office, or his retirement,
or resignation, or removal from office, but, in such event, the Court,
on motion or supplemental petition filed, at any time within twelve
months thereafter, showing a necessity for the survival thereof to
obtain a settlement of the questions involved, may allow the same

22, 1918. The resignation was to be effective when his successor
took office. New York Times, Nov. 23, 1918, p. 1, col. 8. Carter

command, "no action shall abate," was omitted; the new
provision made it unmistakably clear that the validity
of the judgment was conditional upon substitution.' And
when called upon to interpret the new statute, we went
further than we had in Payne and LeCrone. We vacated
the judgments below, and remanded to the District Court
with a direction to dismiss the cause as abated. United
States ex rel. Claussen v. Curran, supra.
Three conclusions follow from our interpretation of
the statute, plus the Payne and LeCrone interpretations
of a statute with nearly identical language. The first is
that the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to
review the merits of the cause, since respondents called
for review after the period given for substitution had
expired. In addition, the District Court judgment was
valid when entered, since it was entered during the oneyear period. And finally the judgment was not robbed
of its vitality by the abatement of appellate proceedings.
The latter conclusion adheres to the familiar rule that
a judgment against or in favor of a corporation is not
erased by subsequent dissolution. Pendleton v. Russell,
April, 1921. Who Was Who in America (Chicago, 1943), p. 946.
The writ in Payne v. Industrial Board was dismissed on May 1, 1922.
9"Be it enacted . . . SEC. 11. (a) That where, during the pendency of an action, suit, or other proceeding brought by or against an

States, . . .such officer dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold such
office, it shall be competent for the court wherein the action, suit, or
proceeding is pending, whether the court be one of first instance or
an appellate tribunal, to permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or against the successor in office of such officer, if within
six months after his death or separation from the office it be satisfactorily shown to the court that there is a substantial need for so
continuing and maintaining the cause and obtaining an adjudication
of the questions involved." 43 Stat. 936, 941.

supra, at 646. See 47 A. L. R. 1385, n. 1. There is
no good sense in departing from that principle because
a notice of appeal was filed in this case before the corporation ended for all purposes. For even if the judgment had been stayed-a fact that does not appear in
the record before us-the stay would have been conditional upon perfecting the appeal. And we do not think
respondents are in a position to object that they could
not perfect an appeal because the Court of Appeals had
no jurisdiction, when respondents could have remedied
the defect by a motion to substitute the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation.
We have held, above, that the Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction to review the merits. LeCrone and Payne
show that we likewise have no jurisdiction so far as the
merits are concerned. But that, of course, does not affect
our power to set aside the erroneous action of the Court
of Appeals. Our supervisory appellate jurisdiction would
be of little value if the injustice caused by the decision
below were to stand uncorrected. We are not so constricted. The Claussen case, supra, indicates that. And
Walling v. Reuter, Inc., 321 U. S. 671, 676, and cases cited,
is conclusive against respondents' argument.
We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in depriving petitioner Defense Supplies of its valid judgment
in the District Court, and we vacate the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and remand to that court with
directions to dismiss the appeal from the judgment of
the District Court. Reconstruction Finance, as the real
party in interest, Rule 17 (a), Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure; see Heisen v. Smith, 138 Cal. 216, 219, 71
