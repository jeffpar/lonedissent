Opinion of the Court.

I. Henry Kutz argued the cause for the United States,
petitioner in No. 201. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General Caudle,
Robert W. Ginnane, Ellis N. Slack and Lee A. Jackson.
David Haar argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent in No. 168.
Sydney W. Cable argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent in Nos. 200 and 201.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The ultimate issue in these three cases is whether tax
claims against a bankrupt bear interest until the date
of bankruptcy,' as held by the court below,' or until
payment, as previously held by another Court of Appeals.'
We granted certiorari' to resolve the conflict, the matter
being of considerable practical importance ' in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act.6
1 The terms "date of bankruptcy" and "bankruptcy," with refer-

ence to time, mean the date when the petition was filed, 30 Stat. 544,
as amended 52 Stat. 840-841, and are used accordingly in this opinion.
'In No. 168 the District Judge allowed New York City interest
to the date of payment, 75 F. Supp. 458, and the Court of Appeals
reversed, 168 F. 2d 268. In Nos. 200-201, the District Judge allowed
the United States and the State of New York interest only to the
date of bankruptcy, 73 F. Supp. 685, and the Court of Appeals

If the question were one of first impression to be decided in the light of the present statute alone, we should
have no difficulty in affirming the court below. More
than forty years ago Mr. Justice Holmes wrote for this
Court that the rule stopping interest at bankruptcy had
then been followed for more than a century and a half.
He said the rule was not a matter of legislative command
or statutory construction but, rather, a fundamental principle of the English bankruptcy' system which we copied.

statute contains no provision expressly repudiating that
principle or allowing an exception in favor of tax claims.

the contrary. Section 63 (a) (1), 11 U. S. C. § 103 (a)
(1) allows interest on judgments and written instruments 8 only to date of bankruptcy. Section 63 (a) (5),
11 U. S. C. § 103 (a) (5) allows interest only to that
date on debts reduced to judgment 9 after bankruptcy."°
No provision permits post-bankruptcy interest on other
claims in general or tax claims in particular. Section
57 (j), 11 U. S. C. § 93 (j), forbidding allowance of governmental penalties or forfeitures, permits " allowance of
losses sustained by the acts penalized, with actual costs
and "such interest as may have accrued thereon according
to law." However, on its face this appears to delimit
even such allowable debts as of the date of bankruptcy
and to allow no more interest than does § 63 with respect
to the claims there specified. Moreover, there is no

"Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his

estate which are founded upon (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by
a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the
time of the filing of the petition by or against him, whether then
payable or not, with any interest thereon which would have been
recoverable at that date or with a rebate of interest upon such as
were not then payable and did not bear interest . ..."

of the petition and before the consideration of the bankrupt's application for a discharge, less costs incurred and interest accrued after

10Although the provisions of § 63 (a) (1) requiring a rebate of
unearned interest, and of § 63 (a) (5) eliminating certain post-bankruptcy interest, may in practice be operative but infrequently, they
reflect a principle of long standing. See 2 Blackstone, Commentaries
*488.
11"Debts owing to the United States or any State or subdivision
thereof as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for
the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction,
or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby and such interest as may
have accrued thereon according to law."

interest except that which accrues according to lawit is exactly such interest that the "fundamental principle" cuts off as of bankruptcy. Section 57 (n), 11
U. S. C. § 93 (n) requires governmental claims to be
proved in the same manner and within the same time
as other debts and only for cause shown may a reasonable
extension be granted. Tax claims are treated the same
as other debts except for the fourth priority of payment,
§ 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a), and the provision making
taxes nondischargeable, § 17, 11 U. S. C. § 35. But each
of these sections is silent as to interest.
The long-standing rule against post-bankruptcy interest thus appears implicit in our current Bankruptcy Act.
To read into such a statute an exception to that rule
would be unwarranted and, as an original proposition,
we should decline to do so. However, the issue comes
here after forty years of bankruptcy administration under
the Act of 1898 followed by ten years under the 1938
Chandler Amendments. Petitioners contend that judicial decisions during those periods have now been incorporated into a legislative policy allowing interest on tax
claims to payment, thereby producing a rule of law
beyond further judicial scrutiny.
It is contended that decisions under the Act of 1898
definitely established such a rule. And petitioners challenge the lower court's holding, despite those decisions,
that the Congress through the Chandler Act completed
the assimilation of taxes to debts and manifested an
intention that such claims be treated, interest-wise, the
same as other debts. They assert that the pre-Chandler
Act allowance of interest to date of payment was
grounded in judicial construction of § 57 (j), approved
at least sub silentio by this Courtin United States v.
Childs, 266 U. S. 304, and adopted by Congressional
reenactment of that section in the Chandler Act. They

also contend that even after the Chandler Act the lower
courts, and this Court in Meilink v. Unemployment
Commission, 314 U. S. 564, affirmed the alleged prior
interpretation of § 57 (j). In such a situation, it is said,
the courts cannot modify what has now become legislative
policy even though originally it may have been a judicially developed rule and one which now, as a matter
of statutory construction, we should reject.
At the outset it may be admitted that in practice under
the Act of 1898 the lower courts generally did allow interest on tax claims until paid. The parties and the lower
courts trace that practice to In re Kallak, 147 F. 276, and
cases following that decision. But we do not believe those
cases support petitioners' contention that the pre-Chandler allowance of post-bankruptcy interest reflects a construction of § 57 (j). The Kallak opinion itself refutes
that contention insofar as it may be based on that line
of cases. The court there first decided that since § 64 (a)
of the Act of 1898 12 gave taxes absolute priority over
claims of every kind, "public taxes do not constitute a
'claim' in bankruptcy." 147 F. 276, 277. The statute
did not require that taxes be proved but that the trustee
should seek them out and pay them in full. In view of
that requirement and since taxes were not claims, the
court saw no reason why the rule stopping interest on
ordinary claims should apply. The court found that rule
was based on considerations of expediency and practical

convenience not present in the case of taxes. First, it
said that allowance of such interest at the varying rates
applicable to the different claims sharing the estate would
prevent definite determination of each claimant's proportionate share. Secondly, such recurring readjustments would complicate administration of the estate.
Since neither difficulty would result from allowing postbankruptcy interest on taxes not sharing the fund with
other obligations, the rule against such interest was held to
be inapplicable. This conclusion was grounded entirely
in reasons of practical convenience. If the case involved
construction of any part of the Act of 1898, it clearly
was § 64 (a) with its requirements of absolute priority
in payment of "all taxes legally due and owing," which,
together with the dispensation from proof, the court considered as indicating that taxes enjoyed a status entirely
different from that accorded ordinary claims. Those provisions were considered controlling, while § 57 (j) was not
mentioned in the opinion. Consequently the latter section's reenactment could not be considered a legislative
adoption of any "judicial gloss" on that section resulting
from the Kallak line of cases. The only section relied
upon in Kallak, § 64 (a), has been significantly amended
to deprive taxes of their preferred status, -first by the
amendment of 1926, and later by the Chandler Act.
The former ",expressly provided that taxes yield priority
to administration expenses and certain wages, neither of
which bear interest. The latter amendments finalized
the subordination of taxes to other priority items. They
also wrote into § 57 (n) the requirement of proof, formerly dispensed with under § 64 (a). Consequently the
argument based on alleged Chandler Act recognition of
lower court interpretations of § 57 (j) seems entirely
without force. And, on the contrary, that enactment did

significantly change the provisions of § 64 (a) which were
decisive in Kallak and similar cases.
Petitioners rely most heavily, however, upon this
Court's decision in United States v. Childs, 266 U. S.
304, reversing In re J. Menist & Co., 290 F. 947. It
is urged that this decision reflected a construction by this
Court of § 57 (j) which the Congress adopted in enacting the Chandler amendments. We do not believe this
contention survives scrutiny of that case or that it is
supported by the legislative history of the Chandler Act.
The Court of Appeals stated that the only issue before
it was "whether an exaction of 1 per cent. a month as
the price of delay amounts to a penalty." 290 F. 947,
949. It decided that anything in excess of 6% per
annum would be a penalty barred by § 57 (j). It is true
that court also stated the allowable interest could run
until payment. However, that statement was also based
on the "highly preferred" status of taxes and the requirement of § 64 (a) that absolute priority be given to "all
taxes legally due and owing." Section 57 (j) was con14In

on Dayton v. Stanard, 241 U. S. 588, as to which see text. In re
J. Menist & Co., 290 F. 947, relying on § 64 (a), is discussed in the
text. In re A. E. Fountain, Inc., 295 F. 873, does not discuss the
issue, deciding only that taxes bear simple interest. Horne v. Boone
County, 44 F. 2d 920, discusses only whether the levy there was
penalty or interest. In re Martin, 75 F. 2d 618, does not discuss the
issue. In re Semon, 11 F. Supp. 18, modified 80 F. 2d 81, was based
on the Revenue Act of 1928 and the Court of Appeals decided only
that the levy there was not a penalty. In re Beardsley & Wolcott
Mfg. Co., 82 F. 2d 239, also involved only the penalty issue. Compare In re William F. Fisher & Co., 148 F. 907, denying the claimed
interest because § 64 (a) contained no provision allowing it; and

sidered as establishing that 12%, as a penalty, could
not be allowed but that 6% was a "pecuniary loss" within
the meaning of that section, and allowable as such, in full.
But the Government challenged in this Court only
the holding that the 12% interest was a penalty barred
by § 57 (j). This Court reversed as to that point and
the opinion makes it clear that it was the only issue
considered and decided here. The question whether
interest could run to payment, although discussed in
respondent's brief on the merits, was not the issue which
induced the Court to bring the case here, and it is not
discussed in the opinion. We cannot agree that the case
represents even a sub-silentio approval of allowance of
post-bankruptcy interest. Even assuming, arguendo,
such approval to be implicit in the decision, it would not
help petitioners, relying solely on reenactment of § 57 (j),
since we have shown the lower court's holding was based
largely on provisions of § 64 (a) which have since been
changed by the Act of 1926 and the Chandler Act.
Other decisions of this Court cited by petitioners on
this point do not help their cause and require little discussion. Dayton v. Stanard, 241 U. S. 588, approved payment of interest to individuals who, during the course
of a bankruptcy, paid off tax liens binding property of
the bankrupt. The Court's decision was only that such
parties, whose tax deeds were invalidated because at the
time they were issued the property was in custodia legis,
could be reimbursed out of the estate's general fund
for both their advances and interest at the legal rate.
This was simple equity since the claimants had paid
taxes which the then § 64 (a) required the trustee to
seek out and pay in full. New York v. Jersawit, 263
U. S. 493, is clearly a holding limited to the determination that the claim there asserted was a penalty not
allowable under § 57 (j). The case was so described in
the Childs opinion, 266 U. S. 304, 309, and the discus-

NEW YORK v. SAPER.
328

Opinion of the Court.

sion there confirms our conclusion that the latter decision
was similarly limited to that point. Coder v. Arts, 213
U. S. 223, states as a subsidiary point only that, where
the estate was adequate, interest could properly be allowed on a mortgage which the Court had held not to
be a voidable preference.
It is thus clear that when the Chandler amendments
were under consideration in Congress the reported cases
established only that lower courts were allowing interest
on tax claims until payment, either as a matter of practical convenience or because § 64 (a) gave those claims
absolute priority and dispensed with proof. There was
no basis for belief that the lower courts, much less this
Court, had applied any judicial gloss to § 57 (j) requiring
similar preferred treatment, interest-wise, for tax claims.
If any conclusion could have been drawn from the cases
it was that § 64 (a) might have justified a judicial belief
that taxes need not be considered, for any purpose, the
same as other debts. And, as we have seen, both significant provisions of that section were amended with adverse
effects on the status of tax claims. Consequently, reenactment of § 57 (j) does not support petitioners' position
on this issue. This conclusion is confirmed by the complete lack of any indication in the legislative history that
Congress considered § 57 (j) in this connection. Petitioners are in fact asserting that adding to an alleged
sub-silentio ruling here on § 57 (j) Congressional silence
in reenacting that section precipitated a legislative command that post-bankruptcy interest be allowed on tax
claims which, at the same time, were deliberately being
reduced to the level of other debts. Mere statement of
the proposition indicates its rejection.
The Court of Appeals concluded that by the 1926
amendment and the Chandler Act, Congress assimilated
taxes to other debts for all purposes, including denial of
post-bankruptcy interest. We think this is a sound and

logical interpretation of the Act after those amendments
to §§ 64 (a) and 57 (n). Considered in conjunction with
the general rule against post-bankruptcy interest 15 as well
as § 63's limitations of interest on other claims to date
of bankruptcy, they compel our conclusion, already stated,
that the statute as amended did not contemplate any
exception in favor of tax claims.
Petitioners' final contention is that even after the
Chandler Act the lower courts continued to allow postbankruptcy interest, that this Court in Meilink v. Unemployment Commission, 314 U. S. 564, approved the
practice, and that Congressional recognition of that interpretation is reflected in an unsuccessful attempt to modify
§ 57 (j). It may be admitted that lower courts, other
than the one whose judgment is now being reviewed,
did continue to allow such interest after the 1938 amendment." But this Court has not, in the Meilink case or
otherwise, passed on the question. That case involved
the same issue that had been presented in Childs: whether
or not the interest there challenged was in fact a penalty
proscribed by § 57 (j) which had been left substantially
unchanged by the Chandler Act. We decided only that
question.
But, irrespective of that decision, petitioners contend
that Congress has considered the lower courts' postChandler Act decisions as a statutory interpretation
which can be overruled only by legislation. The argu15

ment is based on a Committee Report accompanying a
bill approved by the House during the 80th Congress but
not acted upon in the Senate. Among Bankruptcy Act
amendments proposed in this bill was one designed "both
to clarify and modify" § 57 (j). The change, it was said
in the House Report, was to make it clear that the section
referred to interest on the "pecuniary loss" and that such
interest stops at bankruptcy. The clarifying clause was
"intended to overrule an obsolete rule" as to interest on
delinquent taxes. It was stated that although §§ 64 (a)
and 57 (n) as amended by the Chandler Act rendered
the reasoning of the Kallak case obsolete, nevertheless
its rule had not been changed and legislation was necessary, citing Davie v. Green, 133 F. 2d 451, the case
which conflicts with the decision now being reviewed.
The text of the section of the report devoted to this
proposed amendment is printed in the margin. 7 We
17"11. Section 11 (a) of the bill is intended both to clarify and
modify section 57j of the act. The change in 57j (c) is to make clear
that the limitation on interest 'up to the date of bankruptcy' relates
only to interest on the 'pecuniary loss,' and further that such
interest stops at the date of bankruptcy. The addition of clause (2)
in the bill is intended to overrule an obsolete rule as to interest on
delinquent tax debts. Interest on general unsecured debts, on unsecured Government debts other than taxes, and on debts entitled to
priority under section 64a, is suspended at the date of bankruptcy so
that, except in the rare case of a solvent estate, interest is allowable
only to such date. (See. 63a; Adams v. Napa Cantina Wineries
(C. C. A., 9th Cir.), 36 Am. B. R. (N. S.) 8; In re Gandolfi & Co.,
Inc. (S. D., N. Y.), 51 Am. B. R. (N. S.) 521 (governmental debts and
other debts entitled to priority); 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed.,
1835 et seq.; 2 Remington on Bankruptcy, 4th Ed., sees. 771, 795.)
However, interest on delinquent tax debts is allowable to the date
of payment (In re Kallak (D. C., N. D., 1906), 17 Am. B. R. 414;
In re Ashland Emery and Corundum Co. (D. C., Mass., 1916), 36 Am.

believe a fair reading of it leads to the conclusion that
the Committee believed, not that the Chandler Act either
allowed post-bankruptcy interest or left the matter open,
but that the courts in allowing such interest were ignoring
the necessary and intended implications from the Chandler amendments to §§ 57 (n) and 64 (a). The court
below did not have this report before it, but in a wellconsidered opinion reached the same conclusion. We believe that conclusion is confirmed by the report and that
petitioners' contentions find no support in either the
Chandler Act or this abortive attempt at clarification.18
Act, a tax debt is required to be proved (sec. 57n) and its order of
priority ranks below all administration costs and expenses, wages
and costs and expenses of creditors successfully opposing a settlement or discharge, or procuring a conviction for an offense (sec. 64a
(1), (2), (3)), thereby rendering obsolete the reasoning in the
Kallak case, nevertheless its rule has not been changed, and therefore
requires this statutory modification. For further discussion see In
re D. 0. Summers (Ref., N. D., Ohio, 1939), 46 [45] Am. B. R.

this amendment to section 57j. Its most recent reaffirmation of its
position was in October 1946. (See Report of the Judicial Conference, October 1946, p. 15.) The Administrative Office of the United
States Courts has stated that the language of section 11 of the bill
is satisfactory on this score." H. R. Rep. No. 2083, 80th Cong.,
2d Sess., p. 5.
18 The United States cites, as confirming the construction it has
placed on § 57 (j), federal taxing statutes beginning with the Revenue
Act of 1924 which direct that upon nonpayment of the tax there
shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the specified rate from
due date to date of payment. It has been held that federal taxes
ordinarily bear interest even in the absence of statute. See Billings v.
United States, 232 U. S. 261, 284-288. But we do not think either
such a rule or statutory provision could be permitted to negative the

Opinion of the Court.

The case thus presents only the conflict between two
Courts of Appeals as to the proper interpretation of the
current statute. We agree with the court below and
resolve the conflict by affirming its judgments."9
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE REED dissents for the reasons given in
Davie v. Green, 133 F. 2d 451.

Bankruptcy Act's requirement in that respect if the latter be to the
contrary, as we think it is. That Act was early held to take into
consideration "the whole range of indebtedness of the bankrupt,
national, state and individual," Guarantee Co. v. Title Guaranty Co.,
224 U. S. 152, 160, and to have been passed "with the United States
in the mind of Congress," Davis v. Pringle, 268 U. S. 315, 317.
We do not believe the Revenue Act of 1924 and similar enactments
were intended to amend the comprehensive scheme of the Bankruptcy Act, with an effect clearly contrary to specific amendments
such as the Act of 1926 and the Chandler Act. This vould indeed be
a strange way to require, as it would, that federal tax claims be preferred over state and municipal claims when the Bankruptcy Act
itself treats all tax claims equally. This contention, standing by
itself, or in support of the argument based on § 57 (j), cannot be
accepted.
19 Since we have concluded that neither the alleged legislative
treatment of this issue nor prior rulings of this Court support the
contrary result, this decision involves no consideration of the principle of stare decisis. If it did, the responsible exercise of the judicial
process, Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119, would dictate
that the express principles and logical implications of the Chandler
Act prevail over earlier inconclusive lower court holdings and Congressional failure to correct them.
