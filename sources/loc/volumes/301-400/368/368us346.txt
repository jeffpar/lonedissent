No. -.

Decided December 18, 1961.

District Court denying such an injunction, is denied.
Reported below: 199 F. Supp. 595.

Constance Baker Motley, Jack Greenberg, James M.
Nabrit III and R. Jess Brown for movants.
Joe T. Patterson, Attorney General of Mississippi,
Charles Clark and Peter M. Stockett, Special Assistant
Attorneys General, and Dugas Shands and Edward L.
Cates, Assistant Attorneys General, for Patterson et al.,
and Thomas H. Watkins for the City of Jackson et al.,
respondents.
Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Marshall, Harold H. Greene and Howard A. Glickstein filed
a memorandum for the United States, as amicus curiae,
in support of the motion.
PER CURIAM.

This is a motion for an injunction to stay the prosecution of a number of criminal cases in the courts of Mississippi pending an appeal to this Court from the judgment
of a three-judge Federal District Court.. A federal injunction to stay state criminal proceedings is an extraordinary
remedy. Cf. Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S.
157; Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123. In addition to the
considerations normally attending an application for such
relief, a serious question of standing is presented on this

motion, in that it appears that the movants themselves
are not being prosecuted in the Mississippi courts. On
the record before us the motion for a stay injunction
pending appeal is denied.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER
concur in the denial of a stay solely on the ground that the
three movants are not themselves being prosecuted or
threatened with prosecutions in Mississippi and they
therefore reach no other questions.

In the light of the Solicitor General's concession that
petitioner's lien is choate, and the Court agreeing therewith, certiorari is granted, the judgment is vacated and
the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
