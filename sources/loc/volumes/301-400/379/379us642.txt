Per Curiam.

PER CURIAM.

These appeals are from a single judgment of a threejudge District Court, 229 F. Supp. 572, which set aside
and permanently enjoined the operation, enforcement and
execution of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 321 I. C. C. 582, canceling certain rate reductions which had been put into effect by the appellee railroads on the grounds that the new lower rates violated
§§ 1 (5) and 3 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49
U. S. C. §§ 1 (5), 3 (1) (1958 ed.). The judgment of the
District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to the
District Court with instructions to enter an order remanding the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission for reconsideration by the Commission in light of the
District Court's determinations (1) that the Commission's conclusion that § 3 (1) was violated was not supported by adequate findings and (2) that the Commission's conclusion that § 1 (5) was violated was based, at
least in part, on its prior conclusion that there was a violation of § 3 (1). See FPCv. Idaho Power Co., 344 U. S.
17, 20.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE STEWART,
JUSTICE WHITE

appeals and set them for argument on the merits.
