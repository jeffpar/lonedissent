FORTY-FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF

COLORADO

ET AL.

v. LUCAS

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT

No. 661.

OF COLORADO.

Decided February 1, 1965.

Judgment with respect to federal questions affirmed; judgment with
respect to other questions vacated and cause remanded.
Reported below: 232 F. Supp. 797.

Duke W. Dunbar, Attorney General of Colorado,
Charles S. Vigil, Richard S. Kitchen, Sr., Stephen H. Hart
and James Lawrence Whit? for appellants.
Charles Ginsberg and George Louis Creamer for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

Insofar as the judgment of the District Court decides
federal questions, it is affirmed. Insofar as the judgment
decides other questions, it is vacated and the cause is
remanded for further consideration in light of the supervening decision of the Colorado Supreme Court in White
v. Anderson, Colo. -, 394 P. 2d 333 (1964).
MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE

STEWART,

and MR.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG,

concurring.

It is our understanding that the Court's disposition of
this case leaves it open to the District Court to abstain
on the question as to the severability of the various provisions of Amendment No. 7, pending resolution of that
issue with reasonable promptitude in further state court
proceedings. We deem it appropriate explicitly to state
our view that this is the course which the District Court
should follow. On this basis, we join the Court's opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1964.
February 1, 1965.

379 U. S.

HUGHES ET AL. V. WMCA, INC., ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 623.

Decided February 1, 1965.*

Affirmed.

John H. Hughes, pro se, for appellants in No. 623.
Leonard B. Sand, Max Gross, Leo A. Larkin, Jack B.
Weinstein and Robert B. McKay for appellees in No. 623.
Robert Y. Button, Attorney General of Virginia, R. D.
McIlwaine III, Assistant Attorney General, David J.
Mays and Henry T. Wickham for appellants in No. 718.
Edmund D. Campbell and E. A. Prichard for Mann
et al., and Henry E. Howell, Jr., Leonard B. Sachs and
Sidney H. Kelsey for Glanville et al., appellees in No. 718.
PER CURIAM.

The motions to affirm are granted and the judgments
are affirmed.
and MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG join
the affirmance in No. 623 since it is their understanding
that it in no way interferes with the power of the District
Court, in the light of circumstances as they may develop,
to vacate or otherwise modify its order requiring an
election in the fall of 1965.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins,
dissenting.
Both of these cases, today affirmed summarily by the
Court, raise serious problems concerning the scope of
*Together with No. 718, Davis, Secretary, State Board of Elections, et al. v. Mann et al., on appeal from the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
