Opinion of the Court.

MR.

JUSTIcE FRANKFURTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question here in controversy is a matter of great
importance to Puerto Rico and involves the power of its
legislature to enforce Congressional policies affecting the
Island. We therefore brought the case here on a writ of
certiorari, to review a decision of the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit. 106 F. 2d 754. That court
had reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico, 53 P. R. 779 (Spanish edition) sustaining a
proceeding in quo warranto brought against respondent.
The proceeding was initiated in the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico under jurisdiction conferred upon it by the
local legislature. The substance of two measures, enacted
in 1935, and set out below, authorized the Government
of Puerto Rico to bring a quo warranto proceeding in its
Supreme Court against any corporation violating federal
law.' Accordingly, the Attorney General of the Island
'Act No. 33 of July 22, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session,
1935, p. 418, providing:
"Section 1.-There is hereby conferred upon the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico exclusive original jurisdiction to take cognizance of all
Quo Warranto proceedings that the Government of Puerto Rico may
hereafter institute for violations of the provisions of Section 752, Title
48, United States Code, and for that purpose it is provided that the
violation of said provisions shall constitute sufficient cause to institute
a proceeding of the nature of Quo Warranto.
"Section 2.-All laws or parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby
repealed.
"Section 3.-This Act, being of an urgent character, shall take effect
immediately after its approval."
Act No. 47 of August 7, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session,
1935, pp. 530-32, providing:
"Section 1.-Section 2 of An Act entitled 'An Act establishing Quo
Warranto proceedings,' approved March 1, 1902, is hereby amended
as follows:

or execute any public office or should unlawfully make use of any

brought the present suit against respondent, a corporation
organized in 1927 under Puerto Rico's corporation law.
The gravamen of the suit was alleged defiance by respondent of the Congressional restriction imposed upon
"every corporation authorized to engage in agriculture . . . to the ownership and control of not to exceed
five hundred acres of land." This restriction, according
to the complaint, embodied "the public policy of the
franchise, or likewise shall hold any office in any corporation created
by and existing under the laws of Puerto Rico, or any public officer

shall have done or suffered any act which, by the provisions of the
law, involves a forfeiture of his office, or any association or number of
persons shall act within Puerto Rico as a corporation, without being
legally incorporated, or any corporation does or omits any act which
amounts to a surrender or forfeiture of its rights and privileges as a
corporation, or exercises rights not conferred by law, the Attorney
General, or any prosecuting attorney of the respective district court,
either on his own initiative or at the instance of another person, may
file before any district court of Puerto Rico a petition for an information in the nature of Quo Warranto in the name of The People of
Puerto Rico; or whenever any corporation, by itself or through any
other subsidiary or affiliated entity or agent, exercises rights, performs
acts, or makes contracts in violation of the express provisions of the
Organic Act of Puerto Rico or of any of its statutes, the Attorney
General or any district attorney, either on his own initiative or at the
instance of another person, may file before the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico a petition for an information in the nature of Quo Warranto in the name of The People of Puerto Rico; and if from the
allegations such court shall be satisfied that there is probable ground
for the proceeding, the court may grant the petition and order the
information accordingly. Where it appears to the court that the
several rights of divers parties to the same office or franchise may
properly be determined on the same proceeding, the court may give
leave to join all such persons in the same petition, in order to try their
respective rights to such office or franchise.'
"'When any corporation by itself or through any other subsidiary
or affiliated entity or agent is unlawfully holding, under any title, real
estate in Puerto Rico, the People of Puerto Rico may, at its option,
through the same proceedings, institue [sic] in its behalf the confiscation of such property, or the alienation thereof at public auction,

People of Puerto Rico" first declared by Congress in its
Joint Resolution of May 1, 1900, 31 Stat. 715, supplementing the Foraker Act of April 12, 1900, 31 Stat. 77.V
This limitation upon the corporate ownership of land was
continued when Congress in 1917 revised the constitutional framework of Puerto Rico's government in what
is the existing Organic Act, § 39 of the Act of March 2,
1917, 39 Stat. 951, 964 (48 U. S. C. § 752).
The present controversy derives from the fact that
Congress affixed no direct consequences to disobedience
of its land policy for Puerto Rico. The main issue presented here is whether Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly
has power to graft such consequences upon the Conwithin a term of not more than six months counting from the date on
which final sentence is rendered.
"'In every case, alienation or confiscation shall be through the corresponding indemnity as established in the law of eminent domain.'"
2 § 3 of the Joint Resolution provides:
"No corporation shall be authorized to conduct the business of buying and selling real estate or be permitted to hold or own real estate
except such as may be reasonably necessary to enable it to carry out
the purposes for which it was created, and every corporation hereafter
authorized to engage in agriculture shall by its charter be restricted to
the ownership and control of not to exceed five hundred acres of land;
and this provision shall be held to prevent any member of a corporation engaged in agriculture from being in any wise interested in any
other corporation engaged in agriculture. Corporations, however,
may loan funds upon real estate security, and purchase real estate
when necessary for the collection of loans, but they shall dispose of
real estate so obtained within five years after receiving the title. Corporations not organized in Porto Rico, and doing business therein,
shall be bound by the provisions of this section so far as they are
applicable."
Whether the restriction operates directly as a limitation upon the
powers of the corporation or merely as a limitation upon the Legislative Assembly's power to confer corporate privileges, its effect is to
render corporate land ownership in excess of the prescribed acreage
unlawful. See the opinion of Attorney General Wickersham, 28 Op.
A. G. 258, 260-261.

gressional prohibition. This was the issue as the
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico conceived it, and we are
not disposed to deal with it differently. It was suggested by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals
that the Supreme Court's judgment may be supported
by construing the 1935 legislation as a means of enforcing
the local land policy-identic, to be sure, with that declared by Congress-embodied in the 1911 corporation
law of Puerto Rico. To do so, however, would take us
into niceties of pleading and of local law which were not
canvassed by the insular court. Such a course would be
peculiarly gratuitous when the issue which the local
court in fact decided is easily resolved.
In the setting of the traditional relation between the
broad outlines designed by Congress for the government
of territories and the powers of local legislatures to move
freely within those outlines, the difficulties conjured up
against the view taken by the Puerto Rican court rapidly
evaporate. The objections urged against it illustrate
vividly the power of subtle argument to give an appearance of difficulty to what is relatively simple. The
breadth of local autonomy reposed by Congress in the
Legislative Assembly was elucidated too recently and too
thoroughly in Puerto,Rico v. Shell Co., 302 U. S. 253,
to call for repetition here. Suffice it to say that the
opinion in that case underlined the fullness of scope
which Congress gave to Puerto Rico when it provided
by § 37 of the Organic Act of 1917 that "the legislative
authority shall extend to all matters of a legislative
character not locally inapplicable . . ." 39 Stat. 964,
48 U. S. C. § 821. Drawing on the practice of Congress
in its treatment of territories throughout our history,
and assimilating that practice into the Puerto Rican
situation, the Court concluded that "The grant of legislative power in respect of local matters, contained in § 32
of the Foraker Act and continued in force by § 37 of the

Organic Act of 1917, is as broad and comprehensive as
language could make it." 302 U. S. at 261.
Surely nothing more immediately touches the local
concern of Puerto Rico than legislation giving effect to
the Congressional restriction on corporate land holdings.
This policy was born of the special needs of a congested
population largely dependent upon the land for its livelihood.' It was enunciated as soon as Congress became
responsible for the welfare of the Island's people, was
retained against vigorous attempts to modify it,4 and was
reaffirmed when Congress enlarged Puerto Rico's powers
of self-government. Surely Congress meant its action to
have significance beyond mere empty words. To treat
the absence of a specific remedy for violation of the restriction as an implied bar against local enforcement
measures is to impute to Congress a dog-in-the-manger
attitude bordering on disingenuousness. We refuse to
believe that Congress was bent on the elaborate futility
of a brutum fulmen. What was said in another context,
Texas & N. 0. R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, 281 U. S. 548,
569, is apposite here: "The definite prohibition which
Congress inserted in the Act cannot therefore be overridden in the view that Congress intended it to be ignored. As the prohibition was appropriate to the aim
of Congress, and is capable of enforcement, the conclusion must be that enforcement was contemplated." The
suggestion that enforcement might come only through

quo warranto proceedings by the Attorney General of the
United States is equally reckless.
A much more rational explanation, consistent with the
organic relation between Congress and the local government, is at hand. As the ultimate legislative guardian
of the Island's welfare, Congress confined the legislature's
discretion within the limits of the five hundred-acre restriction. How this policy was to be realized was for
Puerto Rico to say. "Local authorities may ascertain
facts and decide questions upon which depends appropriate exertion of the power much more conveniently
than may the Congress." Public Service Commission v.
Havemeyer, 296 U. S. 506, 515-16.
It is admitted, as indeed in view of the Shell case it
could not be denied, that the remedy here pursued would
have been available to the Legislative Assembly if that
body had adopted the -Congressional policy in a substantive statute of its own. But respondent contends that
the same result cannot be achieved by investing the
insular courts with jurisdiction directly to enforce the
Congressional policy. Such useless indirection is compelled neither by the Organic Act nor by any general
consideration underlying the distribution of power between Congress and the insular legislature. So long as
the Legislative Assembly acts within the framework
which Congress has set up it merely avails itself of the
power conferred in § 37 of the Organic Act. It has done
so here.
There remains for consideration an objection based on
§ 256 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 371). That section vests in "the courts of the United States ...
exclusive of the courts of the several States" jurisdiction
of all suits "for penalties and forfeitures incurred under
the laws of the United States." Whether a law passed
by Congress is a "law of the United States" depends on
the meaning given to that phrase by its context. A law

for the District of Columbia, though enacted by Congress,
was held to be not a "law of the United States" within
the meaning of § 250 of the Judicial Code. American
Security Co. v. District of Columbia, 224 U. S. 491. Likewise, we hold that § 39 of the Organic Act is not one of
"the laws of the United States" within the meaning of
§ 256. Section 39 is peculiarly concerned with local policy calling for local enforcement from which local courts
should not be excluded by a statutory provision plainly
designed for the protection of policies having general
application throughout the United States.
Other objections urged at the bar and in respondent's
brief do not call for particular mention. On the only
questions now before us, we think the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico acted within the scope of power validly conferred upon it by the Legislative Assembly.' The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must therefore be
Reversed.
MR. JUsTICE MCREYNOLDS did not participate in the
decision of this case.

The imposition of a fine by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, as
a part of the power to grant relief ancillary to the main proceeding
for forfeiture of the corporate privileges, was within the scope of
authority validly conferred upon it by the 1935 legislation. Compare
Illinois v. Illinois Central R. Co., 33 F. 721. See High, Extraordinary
Legal Remedies, §§ 745-762.
