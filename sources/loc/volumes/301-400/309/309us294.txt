low rightly declined to give effect to that statute and as
it found that the cause of action was not barred by
laches, it rightly gave judgment for respondents.
Petitioners argue that under New York law, laches is
not a defense to actions like the present and that in the
light of our decisions in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra,
Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co., 304 U. S. 202,
federal courts in the exercise of the equity jurisdiction
conferred upon them by § 24 of the Judicial Code, 28
U. S. C. § 41, are no longer free to apply a different rule.
But in this case laches has not been held to be a defense
and the Court has not declined to give effect to a state
statute shown to be applicable. In the circumstances we
have no occasion to consider the extent to which federal
courts, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon
them by Congress to administer equitable remedies, are
bound to follow state statutes and decisions affecting
those remedies.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment
should be reversed for the reasons stated in the dissenting
opinion of Clark, J., in the Circuit Court of Appeals.

FISCHER v. PAULINE OIL & GAS CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 239.

Submitted December 12, 1939.-Decided February 26, 1940.

1. Where a state supreme court bases its judgment exclusively upon
its construction of a federal statute, expressly declining to consider
an alternative local ground, the judgment is reviewable by this

Court. P. 296.

Opinion of the Court.

2. Section 67 (f) of the Bankruptcy Act does not intend that an
adjudication of bankruptcy shall operate automatically, and irrespective of any action on the part of the trustee, to discharge an
execution lien obtained within four months prior to the filing of
the petition in bankruptcy. P. 300.
The section is intended for the benefit of creditors of the bankrupt and, therefore, does not avoid liens as against all the world
but only as against the trustee and those claiming under him, or
as respects the bankrupt's exempt property. P. 301.
3. A trustee in bankruptcy appeared in a state court and unsuccessfully objected to the confirmation of a sale on execution'of property
that had belonged to the debtor, upon the ground that the execution lien had been discharged by force of § 67 (f) of the Bankruptcy
Act. Held that the decision against him, from which he did not
appeal, was binding, as to that question, against the trustee and
against one who later applied for, and with the trustee's acquiescence
obtained, confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a sale of the
same property which had been made to him by the debtor's assignee
for creditors. P. 303.

An appeal taken in this car:e was dismissed for want
of jurisdiction. Section 237 (a), Judicial Code, as
amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936,

309 U. S.

§ 237 (c), Judicial Code, as amended (43 Stat. 936, 938),
we granted certiorari, 308 U. S. 509, because the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma 1 is based upon
a construction of § 67 (f) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,2
which raises an important question concerning the operation of the section, not settled by decision of this court,
on which state courts have reached conflicting conclusions.
The petitioner brought action to quiet his title to an
oil and gas lease and to gain possession of the leased
premises together with materials, machinery, tools, and
appliances thereon, and for mesne profits, and damages.
His claim was based on a sheriff's deed consummating an
execution sale under a judgment entered upon an award
of the State Industrial Commission against Geraldine
Oil Company. The respondent's title was derived through
a conveyance by an assignee for the benefit of creditors
of the same company, confirmed by a bankruptcy court.
The respondent cross-petitioned for a judgment declaring the sheriff's sale to petitioner void and quieting respondent's title. The trial court directed a verdict for
petitioner and entered judgment thereon, which the
Supreme Court reversed.
August 30, 1934, the Commission made an award to one
Rainbolt against Snyder, as employer, and Geraldine Oil
Company, as owner' of the property. For payment of the
award Geraldine Oil Company was secondarily liable.
October 11, 1934, Geraldine Oil Company, being insolvent, assigned the property in question to a trustee for
the benefit of creditors.

by chapter VII, § 67a, (1), (2), (3) and (4) of the Chandler Act of
June 22, 1938, 52 Stat. 840, 875. The question here presented, however, may arise under the later Act.

FISCHER v. PAULINE OIL CO.
294

Opinion of the Court.

December 8, 1934, the award in favor of Rainbolt was
filed of record in a State District Court and became a
judgment of that court.
January 21, 1935, the assignee for the benefit of creditors sold the property to the respondent.
September 13, 1935, execution issued on the Rainbolt
judgment, and, September 17th, the sheriff levied on the
property as property of the Geraldine Oil Co. The execution was issued on the theory that the assignment for the
benefit of creditors was invalid, and the property, therefore, remained that of the assignor.
October 24, 1935, Geraldine Oil Company was adjudged
a voluntary bankrupt in the District Court of the United
States for Western Oklahoma.
November 12, 1935, the sheriff sold the property, pursuant to the execution, and the petitioner bought it. A
notice of the adjudication in bankruptcy was read at the
sale in the presence of the petitioner. On the same day
the sheriff made return of the sale to the court out of
which the execution issued.
November 21, 1935, the trustee in bankruptcy filed in
that court his objections to the confirmation of the sheriff's sale, alleging, inter alia, that Geraldine Oil Company
was insolvent when Rainbolt obtained judgment and had
been so ever since; that the company had been adjudicated a bankrupt within four months of the securing of
the lien under the execution, and that, by virtue of § 67
(f) of the Bankruptcy Act, the lien was absolutely void.
March 28, 1936, the court ordered that the sale be confirmed and granted the trustee in bankruptcy an exception
to its action. The latter gave notice of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Oklahoma, but it does not appear that
he perfected an appeal. The order of confirmation was
entered of record April 22, 1936.

State Bank v. Bradshaw, 174 Okla. 268; 51 P. 2d 514.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

June 4, 1936, the respondent petitioned the United
States District Court for confirmation of the sale of the
property made to the respondent by the assignee for the
benefit of creditors on January 21, 1935. The trustee in
bankruptcy objected, but subsequently withdrew his objections and the referee made an order confirming the
sale. The assignee then paid to the trustee the consideration received by him from the respondent as purchaser
at the assignee's sale. It does not appear that the petitioner had notice of the application or was present at the
hearing.
June 10, 1936, the sheriff delivered a deed to the petitioner as purchaser at the execution sale.
Both petition and answer allege that the respondent
was in possession of the property at the time suit was
brought, and we may assume that the petitioner never
was in possession.
The Supreme Court held that entry of the Commission's award in the State Court made it a judgment of
that court; that such judgment did not constitute a lien
on the property of Geraldine Oil Company in question;
and that no lien was acquired until the levy of execution
on September 17, 1935, about a month prior to the adjudication of the company as a bankrupt.
The respondent asserted that, as the judgment in favor
of Rainbolt was not a lien when Geraldine Oil Company
assigned for the benefit of creditors, or when the assignee
sold the property to the respondent, its title must prevail;
and, in the alternative, that the same result must follow
from the fact that since the lien of the levy was obtained
less than four months prior to the filing of the petition in
bankruptcy, it was voided by § 67 (f).
The Supreme Court stated that, if either of these contentions were sound, the petitioner could not prevail.
It expressly declined to consider the efficacy of the sale
by the assignee for the benefit of creditors to pass title

Opinion of the Court.

to the respondent clear of the lien of the subsequent levy,
and rested its decision upon its view of the effect of
§ 67 (f). Since the judgment is based exclusively upon
a federal ground, we have jurisdiction.
Section 67 (f) provides:
"All levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is
insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, . . .shall

be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment,
attachment, or other lien, . . . shall be deemed wholly

discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to
the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt, unless
the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under
such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be
preserved for the benefit of the estate; and thereupon
the same may pass to and shall be preserved by the
trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And
the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section into effect:
Provided, That nothing herein contained shall have the
effect to destroy or impair the title obtained by such levy,
judgment, attachment, or other lien, of a bona fide purchaser for value who shall have acquired the same without notice or reasonable cause for inquiry."
The court held that the section, proprio vigore,
nullified the lien of the levy so that the property passed
to the trustee discharged thereof, and concluded that,
since, at the time of the sheriff's sale, the property was
discharged of the lien, the sale, and the deed delivered
pursuant to it, were void; and, as a trustee's sale would
pass title clear of the lien, the same result would follow
from the bankruptcy court's validation, with the trustee's
consent, of the assignee's sale previously made.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

The question is whether the state court was right in
holding that, by force of § 67 (f), the adjudication in
bankruptcy automatically discharged the lien of the levy,
irrespective of any action on the part of the trustee.
Expressions supporting this view may be found in cases
decided by federal courts,4 and statements squinting in
the same direction have been made by this court.5 In
none of these instances, however, was the litigation between third parties, or between the lienor or one claiming title under an execution sale, and an opponent deriving title from the trustee in bankruptcy. In all of them
a bankruptcy receiver or trustee instituted action in the
bankruptcy court or some other court, or became a party
to the proceeding in which the lien was acquired, to avoid
the lien, or the bankrupt brought suit to avoid the lien
as to property set apart to him as exempt in the bankruptcy case.
Some state courts have definitely held that the adjudication operates automatically to nullify the lien, which
must be treated as void whenever and wherever drawn
into question, either in a direct or a collateral proceeding,
and whether the trustee in bankruptcy has taken the
property into his possession or abandoned it.6

Opinion of the Court.

On the other hand, it was said in Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426, 429: "For the statute
does not, as a matter of substantive law, declare void
every lien obtained through legal proceedings within four
months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy." The
court there pointed out that a number of issues of fact
must be resolved before it can be determined that the
lien is void. And, in Pigg & Son v. United States, 81 F.
2d 334, 337, it was held that liens obtained in judicial
proceedings within four months of the filing of the petition are not void, but voidable in a proper suit, and that
the property affected by the lien does not automatically
pass to the trustee, discharged of the lien.
In Connell v. Walker, 291 U. S. 1, 3, this court indicated that the operation of § 67 (f) is not automatic,
since the trustee in bankruptcy has an election either to
avoid the lien, or to be subrogated to it for the benefit of
the bankrupt estate.
A number of state courts have held, and we think
rightly, that the section is intended for the benefit of
creditors of the bankrupt and, therefore, does not avoid
liens as against all the world but only as against the

trustee and those claiming under him.'

(Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, supra; Connell v.

benefit of the bankrupt save as to his exempt property
or nullified as respects other lienors or third parties."
Although § 67 (f) unequivocally declares that the lien
shall be deemed null and void, and the property affected
by it shall be deemed wholly discharged and released, the
section makes it clear that this is so only under specified
conditions. At the date of creation of the lien the bankrupt must have been insolvent; the lien must have been
acquired within four months of the filing of the petition
in bankruptcy; and the property affected must not have
been sold to a bona fide purchaser. Furthermore, the
lien is preserved if the trustee elects to enforce it for the
benefit of the estate. These conditions create issues
of fact which, as between the trustee, or one claiming
under him, and the lienor, or one claiming by virtue of
the lien, the parties are entitled to have determined judicially. The courses open to the trustee under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 were to proceed to have the lien declared void, by plenary suit,' or by intervention in the
court where it was obtained," or by applying, in the
bankruptcy cause, to restrain enforcement," as might be
appropriate in the circumstances.
In the instant case the trustee intervened in the state
court and opposed the confirmation of the execution sale

questions affecting the validity of the lien.

FISCHER v. PAULINE OIL CO.
294

Opinion of the Court.

on the ground that § 67 (f) had avoided and discharged
the lien of the levy. The issue was decided against him
and he did not appeal. Later, when the respondent, who
had purchased at the assignee's sale, asked the bankruptcy court to confirm that sale, the trustee withdrew
his objections to confirmation and accepted from the
assignee the consideration received from the respondent
as purchaser at the latter's sale. The trustee's acquiescence in the confirmation of the sale to the respondent
would seem to be at least a tacit assertion that the levy
of the execution did not constitute an encumbrance upon
respondent's title. But we think, if in other circumstances the trustee's conduct could amount to an election
to avoid the lien, it can have no such effect here, in view
of the prior decision against him on that issue in the
state court.
We are of opinion that the trustee, having raised the
issue in the state court, was bound by the final decision
of that tribunal. The estoppel of the judgment of the
state court extended not only to him but to the respondent as his transferee. This conclusion requires reversal
of the judgment.
We do not pass upon the question whether the title of
the respondent, derived from the sale of the property
to it by the assignee for the benefit of creditors, is, by
virtue of that sale, superior to the title of the petitioner.
This is a question of state law which the court below
remains free to decide.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

or decision of this case.
