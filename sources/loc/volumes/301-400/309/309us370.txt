opinion of the Court, the Board has not undertaken to
pass on the rights of the employees under those contracts.
Nor has any employee urged, here or below, that the
order affects his contractual rights or casts a cloud on
them. Whether the employees would be indispensable
parties to the proceeding should the Board in order to
effectuate the policies of the Act undertake to nullify
their rights is a question on which we want to reserve
decision until the Board passes on it and until it is put
in issue by persons who have a standing to raise it.

PARAMINO LUMBER CO. ET AL. V. MARSHALL,
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 271.

Argued January 30, 1940.-Decided March 11, 1940.

1. A private Act of Congress which, after an award of compensation
for disability made by a deputy commissioner under the Longshoremen's & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act had become
final by expiration of the time for review, authorized and directed
the Employees' Compensation Commission to review the order and
issue a new one, whereupon there was awarded additional compensation for disability continuing beyond the date as of which
by the prior order it was deemed to have terminated, held, as to
the employer and insurance carrier, not violative of the due process
clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 374, 378.
2. The Act was validly enacted by Congress to cure a defect in
administration developed in the handling of a claim compensable
under the Longshoremen's & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
P. 379.
3. The enactment by Congress of private Acts, except bills of attainder and grants of nobility, is not forbidden by the Federal
Constitution. P. 380.
4. The contention that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be read into the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment, and that the Act denies equal protection,
is rejected. Pp. 379-380.

upholding the constitutionality of a special Act of Congress and dismissing libels in two cases consolidated for
hearing.
Mr. Stanley B. Long, with whom Mr. Edward G.
Dobrin was on the brief, for appellants.
The Act grants to Clark special privileges not accorded
to other longshoremen similarly situated, and denies to
appellants the equal protection of the laws.
Due process has the same meaning in the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments. Twining v. New Jersey, 211
U. S. 78, 100, 101; United States v. Armstrong, 265 F.
683, 690; Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U. S. 312, 326; Bartlett

191 U. S. 310, 325.
Due process requires equal treatment of all persons
similarly situated, and protects against arbitrary classification and discrimination by Congress. Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 535, 536; United States v. Armstrong, supra; United States v. Yount, 267 F. 861, 863;

Fourteenth Amendment. Willoughby on the Constitution, 2d Ed., (1929) pp. 1928, 1929; Story on the Constitution, 5th Ed., (1891) pp. 705, 706.
The, Act is violative of due process however beneficent
its purpose.
The compensation award was a final adjudication
vesting property rights. A valid, final judgment vests
property rights not alterable by subsequent legislation.

454, 455; Gilman v. Tucker, 28 N. E. 1040.
A compensation order under the Longshoremen's Act
is a final determination of "private right, that is, of the
liability of one individual to another under the law as
defined." Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.22, 51. An award
embodies the liability imposed by the Act; and the duty
to abide by it is judicially enforceable.
Subject only to the statutory provisions for review and
modification, an award is a final determination of all
questions involved in the litigation and the rights and
liabilities fixed therein are unalterable. Shugard v.
Hoage, 89 F. 2d 796; Mille v. McManigal, 69 F. 2d 644;

Pillsbury, 55 F. 2d 369. See, also, Twine v. Locke, 68
F. 2d 712.
In Williams v. Norris, 12 Wh. 117, the private Act was
remedial only.
Assuming that the statutory right to file a claim for
the reopening of an award and for additional compensation is in the nature of a continuing cause of action

Argument for Appellants.

(compare Mattson v. Department of Labor and Industries, 293 U. S. 151), the time limitation is inseparable
from the right. Young v. Hoage, 90 F. 2d 395; Ayers v.
Parker,15 F. Supp. 447; Kobilkin v. Pillsbury, 103 F. 2d
667.
The lapse of the time limit on such statutory causes
of action not only bars the remedy but destroys the
liability as well, and an act of the legislature reviving
them constitutes a deprivation of property without due
process of law. Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R.
Co., 268 U. S. 633; Peninsula Produce Exchange v.
New York, P. & N. R. Co., 137 A. 350; aff'd 276 U. S.

278 F. 900, 904; Wenatchee Produce Co. v. Great
Northern Ry. Co., 271 F. 784, 785.
The Act attempts to create a new substantive right
for the benefit of Clark and is not merely an amendment
to the Longshoremen's Act.
Although retrospective operation of a statute in and of
itself affords no basis for invalidating it, the vice of this
Act is its attempt to attach to closed transactions new
liabilities and obligations. Webster v. Cooper, 14 How.
488; Barnitz v. Beverly, 163 U. S. 118; Bradley v. Lightcap, 195 U. S. 1; Ettor v. Tacoma, 228 U. S. 148; Ochoa
v. Hernandez y Morales, 230 U. S. 139. See, also, Dash
v. Van Kleek, 7 Johns. 477. Property rights vested
under existing statutes may not be destroyed by repeal
thereof. United States v. Kendall, 263 F. 126; Arnold &
Murdock Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 145 N. E. 342; Dow
v. Norris, 4 N. H. 16.
A further infirmity is that the Act arbitrarily takes
property from one private individual and gives it to
another. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U. S.
403; Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., 295
U. S. 330; Duncan & Co. v. Wallace, 21 F. Supp. 295,

Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

The Act is an attempted usurpation by Congress of
judicial functions. It is judicial in nature and authorizes a readjudication between individuals of private
property rights arising out of past transactions.
Legislative grant of a new trial, rehearing or further
determination in a cause which has proceeded to final
adjudication under existing statutes is an attempted exercise of judicial power. Merrill v. Sherburne, 1 N. H.

MR. JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question is whether the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment is violated by a private act of Congress
directing a review of an order for compensation under
the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act' after there had been a final award by the deputy
commissioner and after the time for review of the award
had expired.
On January 17, 1931, the appellee Clark fell and fractured a rib while working on the navigable waters of the
United States as a longshoreman for the appellant Paramino Lumber Company. The other appellant, the
Union Insurance Company of Canton, Ltd., is the inS33 U. S. C. §§ 901-50.

surance carrier of the Lumber Company under the Compensation Act. The fall having disabled Clark, the appellants voluntarily paid him compensation. Then, on
Clark's application, hearings were had under the Compensation Act which resulted in a determination on August
26, 1931, by the deputy commissioner that Clark had
been wholly disabled from the date of his fall to July 4,
1931, that on the latter date he had recovered from the
disability, and that he had been paid by appellants all
the compensation due him. No proceedings being
brought to review this award, it became final in thirty
days.2 Almost five years later, the Congress passed a private act ordering the Compensation Commission to review Clark's case and to issue a new order, the provisions
in the Compensation Act limiting time for reviewing
awards "to the contrary notwithstanding." ' The information which led the House and Senate Committees on
Claims to recommend passage of the act 4 indicated that

'49 Stat., pt. 2, p. 2244. The act in full reads:
"That in the case of John T. Clark, of Seattle, Washington, whose
disability compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of March 4, 1927, was terminated as of July
5, 1931, by a compensation order filed August 26, 1931, the Employees' Compensation Commission be, and it is hereby, authorized
and directed to review such order in accordance with the procedure
prescribed in respect of such claims in section 19 of said Act, and
in accordance with such section to issue a new compensation order
which may terminate, continue, increase, or decrease such compensation, the provisions of sections 21 and 22 of the said Act, as
amended, to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided, That such new
order shall not affect any compensation paid under authority of the
prior order."

309 U. S.

Clark had first been treated by his employer's physician
who operated on his twelfth rib and reported that an examination of the eleventh rib showed a firm union at the
site of the fracture of that rib. On the basis of this report the deputy commissioner concluded that Clark had
recovered and terminated his compensation. But Clark's
pain continued, and within four months of the deputy
commissioner's order X-rays taken by other physicians
disclosed that the fracture of the eleventh rib was ununited, and in order to give Clark relief an operation
fusing the bone fragments had to be performed. After
this the rib healed, but in March, 1935, the physician who
performed the second operation reported that Clark was
still experiencing pain in the region of his injury. Since
the deputy commissioner had no jurisdiction over the case
after he made his order, and since the time for judicial
review expired prior to the time of the operation on the
eleventh rib, Clark had no opportunity under the act to
have his compensation readjusted."
After an unsuccessful attempt by appellants to enjoin a
hearing under the private act,' a hearing was had and
discussing the history of the case; and a letter from the deputy
commissioner to the sponsor of the act, Congressman Zioncheck,
relating the deputy commissioner's participation in the case.
'See note 2 supra. Section 22 of the Compensation Act (33
U. S. C. § 922), allowing the deputy commissioner to issue an
amended award "on the ground of a change in conditions or because
of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner,"
was not available to Clark because at the time of his discovery of
his continued disability the deputy commissioner could only take
such action "during the term of an award." 44 Stat. 1437. On May
26, 1934, the section was amended (48 Stat. 807) to allow new awards
because of changed conditions to be made "at any time prior to one
year after the date of the last payment of compensation." Had
this been in force at the time of Clark's injury, presumably it would
have afforded him a remedy for a new award, but when it was
passed more than a year had expired from the last payment of
compensation.
'95 F. 2d 203.

PARAMINO CO. v. MARSHALL.
370

Opinion of the Court.

the deputy commissioner issued a new award granting
Clark compensation for total disability from the date of
the prior award, July 4, 1931, to January 5, 1939. Appellants brought two actions against Clark and the deputy commissioner seeking injunctions against the operation of the private act through prohibition of any further
steps under the new award. The first bill was framed as
an independent suit in equity; the second sought relief
under the section of the Compensation Act providing for
"injunction preceedings" to review awards made under the
Act.' Under the Act of August 24, 1937,8 a three-judge
court was convened and the Attorney General duly notified. The causes having been transferred to the admiralty
side of the court and consolidated for all purposes, the
appellees filed exceptions claiming that the appellants
had failed to state a cause of action. The court upheld
the validity of the special act and sustained the appellee's
9
exceptions.
By direct appeal the appellants challenge the decree
below, contending that the private act violates the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The argument
of appellants is that the original award was an adjudication on which further review was barred prior to the
enactment of the private act; that thereby rights and
obligations were finally determined, the deprivation of
which took from appellants a substantive immunity from
further claims of Clark and created in Clark new substantive rights.
An award under the Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act determines the liability of

employer to employee."0 But we do not agree that the
immunity obtained by the lapse of the time for review
is the type of immunity which protects its beneficiary
from retroactive legislation authorizing review of the
claim. This private act does not set aside a judgment,
create a new right of action or direct the entry of an
award. The hearing provided for is subject to the provisions of the general act for longshoremen's and harbor
workers' compensation. It does not operate to create new
obligations where none existed before. It is an act to
cure a defect in administration developed in the handling
of a compensable claim. If the continuing injury had
been known during the period of compensation, payments
of the same amount due under the award authorized by
this act would have been due to the employee. 1 In such
circumstances we see no violation of the due process
clause.
The principle underlying this conclusion is illustrated
by Graham' & Foster v. Goodcell.12 There a retroactive
act of the Congress barred recovery by taxpayers of payments for taxes, properly owing but collection of which
was barred by limitation. At the time of the enactment
of the controverted statute, the taxpayer had a right to
recover the payment. Limitation had been permitted
to run in favor of the taxpayer under a mistake of law.
This Court upheld the legislation as consistent with due
process on the ground that it was a curative act to remedy
mistakes in administration where the remedy "can be
applied without injustice." 13

Rights obtained by an attaching creditor were subjected to the equity of a prior mortgage, invalid because
improperly recorded, by a subsequent act in McFaddin v.
Evans-Snider-Buel Company.' This Court refused to
accept the argument that such a retroactive statute deprived the holder of the attachment lien, with notice of
the prior equity, of property without due process." Even
more recently in Carpenter v. Wabash Railway Company," we upheld as valid and applicable an act granting priority to railroad employees for damages for personal injuries over other claimants in equity receiverships.
The act there in question was passed while certiorari was
pending in this Court from a contrary decision upon
priority which we assumed to be correct. This ruling
resulted from the "superior equities" of the employees.'
It is unimportant whether the claim persisted after
the bar 8 or ended with the running of limitation.") To
cure a fault of administration Congress may validly enact
this act.
It is urged by appellant, however, that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be

read into the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.
If so read, it is argued, this private act violates the rule
of equal protection. This conclusion, however, we find
untenable. Private acts, as such, are not forbidden by
the Constitution. That instrument contains no provision
against private acts enacted by the federal government
except for a prohibition of bills of attainder and grants
of nobility." It took an act of Congress to outlaw them
in the territories,2 ' even though the Fifth Amendment is
applicable to the territories. 2 The states have different
situations as to the validity of private acts.22 The constitutions of many of the states, unlike the federal, forbid
private legislation without regard to the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.2"
