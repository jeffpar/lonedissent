No. 462.

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

Argued February 8, 1940.-Decided February 26, 1940.

A trust company, which held and administered a fund enabling its
patrons to invest small amounts in securities, filed with a collector
for the district where it conducted its business a fiduciary return
setting forth the gross income of the fund, deductions, net income,
etc.-all the information necessary to the calculation of any tax
that might be due,-and attached a list of the beneficiaries of the
fund and their shares of the income. The beneficiaries included
these shares in their individual returns. The Commissioner made
an additional return for the fund and assessed a deficiency which
the Board of Tax Appeals set aside as too late. Held:
1. The venue for review was in the circuit in which the fiduciary
return was filed. Rev. Act, 1926, § 1002 (a), as amended by the
Rev. Act, 1932, § 519. P. 308.
2. The assessment was barred under the Rev. Act, 1932, § 276
(a), two years after the fiduciagry return was filed. P. 309.
3. Sec. 275 (c), providing a four year limitation if a corporation
makes "no return of the tax imposed," and § 276 (a), providing
that in case of failure to file a return the tax may be assessed "at
any time,"-are inapplicable. P. 309.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUsTIcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case involves the construction and application of
provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by
that of 1934, and of the Revenue Act of 1932, relating to
the venue of proceedings to review a decision of the Board
of Tax Appeals and setting limitations upon the assessment of income tax.
The petitioner is a trust company, doing a general
business as such, including administering trust estates
and acting as agent for the custody, handling, and management of its clients' investments. In 1930 it created,
by an appropriate instrument, a fund to afford those for
whom it acted the advantage of investing small amounts
in securities at minimum expense and with opportunity
of ready liquidation. The fund has since been managed
according to the terms of the agreement. In the course
of administration the petitioner has paid to the, participants their respective shares of income from the invested principal, and has filed fiduciary returns of income
on Treasury Form 1041, intended for use by trustees.
March 15, 1933, the petitioner, as trustee, filed such a
return, for the calendar year 1932, with the Collector of
Internal Revenue for the First District of Pennsylvania,
at Philadelphia. The return accurately set forth the
gross income, the deductions, and the net income,-in
short all information necessary to the calculation of any
tax which might be due,-and attached a list of the
beneficiaries of the fund, and their shares of the income.
No corporation income tax return was filed on Treasury
Form 1120. The participants in the fund, who were required to make individual returns for the year 1932, included in their respective returns, filed on or before
March 15, 1933, their shares of income.
September 17, 1936, pursuant to the recommendation
of a treasury agent that the fund be taxed as a corpora215234o-40-20

tion,1 the respondent prepared from the Form 1041 return, a substitute corporation return on Form 1120,
covering the year 1932, and, on February 27, 1937, gave
notice of a consequent deficiency of tax.
The petitioner carried the matter to the Board of Tax
Appeals for redetermination, asserting that it was taxable as a trust and not as an association and that assessment and collection of the asserted deficiency was barred
by the expiration of two years from the date its return
was filed. The Board held the assessment barred.
The respondent petitioned the United States Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit to review the Board's
decision. That court held that the venue provision of
§ 1002 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by
§ 519 of the Revenue Act of 1934,2 empowered it to entertain the petition, and that the assessment of a deficiency was not barred by §§ 275 and 276 of the Revenue
Act of 1932,2 the applicable section, in its view, being
275 (c).'
'§ 1111 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 289:
"The term 'corporation' includes associations ... " See Morrissey
v. Commissioner, 296 U. S. 344.
2 "Sec. 1002. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) [relating
to venue by stipulation], such decision may be reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the circuit in which is located the collector's

the liability arises or, if no return was made, then by the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia." (Italics supplied.) 44 Stat.

"Except as provided in section 276"(a) General Rule.-The amount of income taxes imposed by this
title shall be assessed within two years after the return was filed, and

taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.

Opinion of the Court.

The petitioner sought certiorari on the ground that the
Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that the fiduciary return it had filed was a return which governed venue under
§ 1002, as amended, but no return within the meaning of
§ 275 (c), conflicts with a decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit.' Because of the conflict we granted certiorari.
Petitioner and respondent agree that the court below
was right in holding the return in question was such a
return as fixed the venue of the petition for review in the
Third Circuit, where the return was filed. We concur in
this view.
The petitioner contends that the fiduciary return filed
on Form 1041 was a return within the meaning of § 275
(a), which limits the time for assessment to two years
after the filing of the return. The respondent insists that
the return was "no return of the tax" within the meaning
of § 275 (c), and, therefore, the four-year limitation specified in that section applies.
As the notice of deficiency was given more than two
years after the filing of the fiduciary return, and within
four years of the filing of the last return by any participant in the fund, decision turns upon which subsection
governs.
We hold that the return was a return within the meaning of § 275 (a) and that the petitioner cannot be held
includes in his return his distributive share of the net income of the
corporation, then the tax of the corporation shall be assessed within
four years after the last date on which any such shareholder's return
was filed." (Italics supplied.)
"See. 276. SAME-EXCEPTIONS.
"(a) False Return or No Return.-In the case of a false or
fraudulent return with intent to evade tax or of a failure to file a
return the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the
collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any
time." Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 237.

to have made no return so as to bring the case within
§ 275 (c).
First. We are of opinion that if the return filed by the
petitioner was such as to create venue of the proceeding
for review in the court below, it was also a return under
the terms of § 275 (a), so that the two-year period of
limitations imposed by that section is applicable.
The return was a fiduciary return. It is admitted that
the petitioner in respect of the fund was a fiduciary and
was bound to file such a return.' It contained all of the
data from which a tax could be computed and assessed
although it did not purport to state any amount due as
tax. Section 1002 (a), as amended, supra,confers venue
upon the Circuit Court for the circuit in which was made
"the return of the tax in respect of which the liability
arises." Section 275 (a) provides that the amount of tax
must be assessed within two years after "the return was
filed." Section 275 (c) fixes a period of four years for
assessment "if a corporation makes no return of the tax
imposed by this title," but each shareholder returns his
distributive share of the net income.
We think the language of the sections is such that it
cannot be said the fiduciary return filed by the petitioner
was a return of the tax in respect of which the liability
arises but was no return of the tax imposed by the statute.
The respondent urges that the two sections have
separate aims; that the venue provision was inserted for
the convenience of taxpayers, so that they should not be
compelled to litigate in courts far from their domicile,
whereas the limitation sections have nothing to do with
the designation of a forum. Conceding that this is true,
it remains that, if the return in question complies with
the one description, it equally complies with the other.

Opinion of the Court.

We find no adequate reason for attributing a different
meaning to the two phrases.
Second. Section 275 (c) is inapplicable. Sections 275
and 276 set up a complete scheme of limitations on assessment of income taxes. Section 275 (a) imposes a
limitation of two years after the filing of the return.
Section 276 (a) provides that there shall be no period of
limitations if a false return, or no return, be filed. If
the statute went no further, and if the respondent's
position is correct that, in this case, the taxpayer was a
corporation and filed no return as such, then there would
be no period of limitations whatever. This was the situation under the Revenue Act of 1924.'
The legislative history demonstrates that § 275 (c) was
adopted to set a period of limitations where no return is
filed by the association but returns are filed only by the
members. In other words, subsection (c) was adopted to
limit, rather than to enlarge, the time for assessment in
such a case.'
The respondent's contention is that where a fiduciary,
in good faith, makes what it deems the appropriate return, which discloses all of the data from which the tax,
treated as one imposed upon an association (classified as
a corporation under the statute), can be computed, such
a return is to be deemed no return. We think this view
inadmissible.

299.
'The provision was first inserted as § 277 (a) (5) of the Revenue
Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 58. The Committee Reports on the section,
construed in connection with the course of the bill in Congress, sustain, rather than negative, the view that the section was intended
to impose a period of limitation where one had not theretofore
existed. See H. Rep. No. 1, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 11; S. Rep.
No. 52, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 28. Compare Hearings, Committee

Syllabus.

309 U. S.

It cannot be said that the petitioner, whether treated
as a corporation or not, made no return of the tax imposed by the statute. Its return may have been incomplete in that it failed to compute a tax, but this defect
falls short of rendering it no return whatever.'
The judgment is
Reversed.
MAYO, COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE OF
FLORIDA, ET .AL. v. LAKELAND HIGHLANDS
CANNING CO. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA.

No. 270.

Argued January 12, 1940.-Decided February 26, 1940.

Canners of citrus fruits operating in Florida, some of them domiciled
in other States, sued to enjoin an official from enforcing an order
made under color of a Florida statute and purporting to fix the
price to be paid the grower for grapefruit, the bill alleging unconstitutionality of the statute, invalidity of the order for failure to
comply with the statutory requirements, and threat of irreparable
injury. Held:
1. That, upon application under Jud. Code, § 266, heard upon
the bill, affidavits and other evidence, the question before the
District Court was not whether the Act was constitutional or unconstitutional; nor whether there had been compliance with its
requirements, if valid; but was whether the showing made raised
serious questions, under the federal Constitution and the state law,
and disclosed that enforcement of the Act, pending final hearing,
would inflict irreparable damages upon the complainants. P. 316.
The court should have confined itself to those issues. Expressions
of opinion on the ultimate merits were premature.
