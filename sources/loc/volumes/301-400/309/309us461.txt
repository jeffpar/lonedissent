HELVERING v. BRUUN.

Syllabus.

Since the unlawful control over the jobbers was established and maintained by resort to the licensing device,
the decree rightly suppressed it even though it had been
or might continue to be used for some lawful purposes.
The court was bound to frame its decree so as to suppress the unlawful practices and to take such reasonable
measures as would preclude their revival. Local 167 v.
United States, 291 U. S. 293; Warner & Co. v. Lilly & Co.,
265 U. S. 526, 532. It could, in the exercise of its discretion, consider whether that could be accomplished
effectively without disestablishing the licensing system,
and whether there were countervailing reasons for continuing it as a necessary or proper means for appellant
to carry out other lawful purposes. Since the court
rightly concluded that these reasons were without substantial weight, it properly suppressed the means by
which the unlawful restraint was achieved. Local 167 v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE, ROBERTS

309 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The controversy had its origin in the petitioner's assertion that the respondent realized taxable gain from the
forfeiture of a leasehold, the tenant having erected a new
building upon the premises. The court below held that
no income had been realized.1 Inconsistency of the decisions on the subject led us to grant certiorari.
The Board of Tax Appeals made no independent findings. The cause was submitted upon a stipulation of
facts. From this it appears that on July 1, 1915, the respondent, as owner, leased a lot of land and the building
thereon for a term of ninety-nine years.
The lease provided that the lessee might, at any time,
upon giving bond to secure rentals accruing in the two
ensuing years, remove or tear down any building on the
land, provided that no building should be removed or
torn down after the lease became forfeited, or during the
last three and one-half years of the term. The lessee was
to surrender the land, upon termination of the lease, with
all buildings and improvements thereon.
In 1929 the tenant demolished and removed the existing building and constructed a new one which had a
useful life of not more than fifty years. July 1, 1933, the
lease was cancelled for default in payment of rent and
taxes and the respondent regained possession of the land
and building.
The parties stipulated "that as at said date, July 1,
1933, the building which had been erected upon said
premises by the lessee had a fair market value of $64,245.68 and that the unamortized cost of the old building,
which was removed from the premises in 1929 to make
way for the new building, was $12,811.43, thus leaving a
net fair market value as at July 1, 1933, of $51,434.25, for
'Helvering v. Bruun, 105 F. 2d 442.

HELVERING v. BRUUN.

Opinion of the Court.

the aforesaid new building erected upon the premises by
the lessee."
On the basis of these facts, the petitioner determined
that in 1933 the respondent realized a net gain of $51,434.25. The Board overruled his determination and the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision.
The course of administrative practice and judicial decision in respect of the question presented has not been
uniform. In 1917 the Treasury ruled that the adjusted
value of improvements installed upon leased premises is
income to the lessor upon the termination of the lease.2
The ruling was incorporated in two succeeding editions
of the Treasury Regulations.'
In 1919 the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Miller v. Gearin,
258 F. 225, that the regulation was invalid as the gain,
if taxable at all, must be taxed as of the year when the
improvements were completed.'
The regulations were accordingly amended to impose
a tax upon the gain in the year of completion of the improvements, measured by their anticipated value at the
termination of the lease and discounted for the duration
of the lease. Subsequently the regulations permitted
the lessor to spread the depreciated value of the improvements over the remaining life of the lease, reporting an
aliquot part each year, with provision that, upon premature termination, a tax should be imposed upon the excess
of the then value of the improvements over the amount
theretofore returned.5

Circuit decided in Hewitt Realty Co. v. Commissioner,

Opinion of the Court.

309 U. S.

76 F. 2d 880, that a landlord received no taxable income
in a year, during the term of the lease, in which his
tenant erected a building on the leased land. The court,
while recognizing that the lessor need not receive money
to be taxable, based its decision that no taxable gain was
realized in that case on the fact that the improvement
was not portable or detachable from the land, and if removed would be worthless except as bricks, iron, and
mortar. It said (p. 884): "The question as we view it is
whether the value received is embodied in something
separately disposable, or whether it is so merged in the
land as to become financially a part of it, something
which, though it increases its value, has no value of its
own when torn away."
This decision invalidated the regulations then in
force.'
In 1938 this court decided M. E. Blatt Co. v. United
States, 305 U. S. 267. There, in connection with the execution of a lease, landlord and tenant mutually agreed
that each should make certain improvements to the
demised premises and that those made by the tenant
should become and remain the property of the landlord.
The Commissioner valued the improvements as of the
date they were made, allowed depreciation thereon to the
termination of the leasehold, divided the depreciated
value by the number of years the lease had to run, and
found the landlord taxable for each year's aliquot portion
thereof. His action was sustained by the Court of
Claims. The judgment was reversed on the ground that
the added value could not be considered rental accruing
over the period of the lease; that the facts found by the
Court of Claims did not support the conclusion of the
Commissioner as to the value to be attributed to the im'The Hewitt case was followed in Hilgenberg v. United States, 21
F. Supp. 453; Staples v. United States, 21 F. Supp. 737, and English

Opinion of the Court.

provements after a use throughout the term of the lease;
and that, in the circumstances disclosed, any enhancement
in the value of the realty in the tax year was not income
realized by the lessor within the Revenue Act.
The circumstances of the instant case differentiate it
from the Blatt and Hewitt cases; but the petitioner's conttntion that gain was realized when the respondent,
through forfeiture of the lease, obtained untrammeled
title, possession and control of the premises, with the
added increment of value added by the new building,
runs counter to the decision in the Miller case and to the
reasoning in the Hewitt case.
The respondent insists that the realty,-a capital asset
at the date of the execution of the lease,-remained such
throughout the term and after its expiration; that improvements affixed to the soil became part of the realty
indistinguishably blended in the capital asset; that such
improvements cannot be separately valued or treated as
received in exchange for the improvements which were on
the land at the date of the execution of the lease; that
they are, therefore, in the same category as improvements
added by the respondent to his land, or accruals of value
due to extraneous and adventitious circumstances. Such
added value, it is argued, can be considered capital gain
only upon the owner's disposition of the asset. The position is that the economic gain consequent upon the enhanced value of the recaptured asset is not gain derived
from capital or realized within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and may not, therefore, be taxed
without apportionment.
We hold that the petitioner was right in assessing the
gain as realized in 1933.
We might rest our decision upon the narrow issue presented by the terms of the stipulation. It does not appear what kind of a building was erected by the tenant
or whether the building was readily removable from the

309 U. S.

land. It is not stated whether the difference in the
value between the building removed and that erected in
its place accurately reflects an increase in the value of
land and building considered as a single estate in land.
On the facts stipulated, without more, we should not be
warranted in holding that the presumption of the correctness of the Commissioner's determination has been
overborne.
The respondent insists, however, that the stipulation
was intended to assert that the sum of $51,434.25 was the
measure of the resulting enhancement in value of the
real estate at the date of the cancellation of the lease.
The petitioner seems not to contest this view. Even
upon this assumption we think that gain in the amount
named was realized by the respondent in the year of
repossession.
The respondent can not successfully contend that the
definition of gross income in ยง 22 (a) of the Revenue Act
of 1932 ' is .not broad enough to embrace the gain in
question. That definition follows closely the Sixteenth
Amendment. Essentially the respondent's position is
that the Amendment does not permit the taxation of
such gain without apportionment amongst the states.
He relies upon what was said in Hewitt Realty Co. v.
Commissioner, supra, and upon expressions found in the
decisions of this court dealing with the taxability of stock
dividends to the effect that gain derived from capital
must be something of exchangeable value proceeding
from property, severed from the capital, however invested or employed, and received by the recipient for
his separate use, benefit, and disposal.' He emphasizes
the necessity that the, gain be separate from the capital
and separately disposable. These expressions, however,

were used to clarify the distinction between an ordinary
dividend and a stock dividend. They were meant to
show that in the case of a stock dividend, the stockholder's interest in the corporate assets after receipt of the
dividend was the same as and inseverable from that
which he owned before the dividend was declared. We
think they are not controlling here.
While it is true that economic gain is not always taxable as income, it is settled that the realization of gain
need not be in cash derived from the sale of an asset.
Gain may occur as a result of exchange of property, payment of the taxpayer's indebtedness, relief from a liability, or other profit realized from the completion of a
transaction.' The fact that the gain is a portion of the
value of property received by the taxpayer in the transaction does not negative its realization.
Here, as a result of a business transaction, the respondent received back his land with a new building on it,
which added an ascertainable amount to its value. It is
not necessary to recognition of taxable gain that he
should be able to sever the improvement begetting the
gain from his original capital. If that were necessary,
no income could arise from the exchange of property;
whereas such gain has always been recognized as realized
taxable gain.
Judgment reversed.

The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result in view of
the terms of the stipulation of facts.
