PER CURIAM.

Petitioners, Autherine J. Lucy and Polly Anne Myers,
citizens of Alabama, have been seeking admission to the
University of Alabama since September 1952. Respondent William F. Adams is Dean of Admissions of the
University. After hearings, United States District Judge
Grooms of the Northern District of Alabama found that
petitioners had been denied admission to the University
"solely on account of their race and color." Holding this

Opinion of the Court.

350 U. S.

denied petitioners equal proteotion of state laws, the court
permanently enjoined respondent Adams, his agents,
employees and others acting in concert with respondent
"from denying the plaintiffs and others similarly situated
the right to enroll in the University of Alabama and
pursue courses of study thereat, solely on account of their
race or color." 134 F. Supp. 235. Respondent's niotion
to suspend the injunction pending appeal to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was granted
by the District Judge. A judge of that court denied a
motion to vacate the suspension and reinstate the injunction. A similar motion is now before us.
The motion is granted and the injunction is reinstated
to the extent that it enjoins and restrains the respondent
and others designated from denying these petitioners,
Autherine Lucy and Polly Anne Myers, the right to enroll
in the University of Alabama and pursue courses of study
there. Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of
Oklahoma, 332 U. S. 631; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S.

Education,339 U. S. 637. In other respects, the motion
is denied.
