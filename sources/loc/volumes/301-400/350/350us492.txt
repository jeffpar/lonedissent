As applied to this New Jersey corporation, the New Jersey corporation tax here involved, measured by the corporation's "net worth,"
is a tax on the corporate franchise, does not discriminate against
federal obligations, and is valid despite the inclusion of federal
bonds in the determination of net worth. Pp. 492-494.

PER CURIAM.

The State of New Jersey imposes on each domestic corporation "an annual franchise tax . . . for the privilege
of having or exercising its corporate franchise" in the
State.' This tax, as applied to appellant, is measured by
the corporation's "net worth," which is defined as the sum
of the corporation's issued and outstanding capital stock,
paid-in or capital surplus, earned surplus and undivided
profits, other surplus accounts which will accrue to the
shareholders (not inciliding depreciation reserves), and
debts owed to shareholders owning 10 percent or more
'N. J. Laws 1945, c. 162, N. J. S. A. §§ 54:1OA-1 et seq.

Opinion of the Court.

of the corporation's stock.2 Appellant is a corporation
organized under the laws of New Jersey, and is therefore
subject to the tax. In assessing appellant's tax for 1952,
the Tax Commissioner included in appellant's net worth
the value of certain federal bonds held by appellant,
thereby increasing the amount due by $320.07. Appellant protested, claiming that under R. S. § 3701, 31
U. S. C. § 742, these bonds were immune from state taxation. The New Jersey courts upheld the Commissioner's
assessment, and this appeal contests the validity of the
state statute as so applied.
Appellant contends that this tax is not in reality a
franchise tax, but is rather in the nature of a direct property tax on the immune federal obligations. Corporate
franchises granted by a State create a relationship which
may legitimately be made the subject of taxation, Home
Ins. Co. v. New York, 134 U. S. 594, 599-600; Flint v.
Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 162; Educational Films
Corp. v. Ward, 282 U.. S. 379, 388; and the statute expressly declares this to be a franchise tax. Moreover, the
Supreme Court of New Jersey has, on independent examination, found this to be "a bona fide franchise tax."I
While this is, of course, not conclusive here, Society for
Savings v. Bowers, 349 U. S. 143, we find no basis in this
instance for not accepting the state court's conclusion that
this tax is not imposed directly on the property held by
the corporation. Cf. Pacific Co. v. Johnson, 285 U. S.
480, 495-496.
Appellant argues further that even if this is a franchise
tax, it must fall because its effect is the same as if it had
been imposed directly on the tax-exempt federal securities.
Since the tax remains the same whatever the character of
d.e§§ 54:C1oA-4 (d) (5).

the corporate assets may be, no claim can be sustained
that this taxing statute discriminates against the federal
obligations. And since this is a tax on the corporate
franchise, it is valid despite the inclusion of federal bonds
in the determination of net worth. This Court has consistently upheld franchise taxes measured by a yardstick
which includes tax-exempt income or property, even
though a part of the economic impact of the tax may be
said to bear indirectly upon such income or property.
See, e. g., Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institutionv. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; Hamilton
Co. vI Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; Home Ins. Co. v. New
York, supra; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, supra;
Pacific Co. v. Johnson, supra. We have only recently
adhered to this principle in another aspect of this field
of taxation. See Society for Savings v. Bowers, supra,
at 147-148. New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division
of Tax Appeals, 338 U. S. 665, on which appellant relies,
is distinguishable, in that it did not involve a franchise
tax, but rather a tax whose legal incidence this Court
found to be upon the intangible assets of the corporation.
Since as applied here this is a permissible tax on the
corporate franchise, the decision below must be
Affirmed.
