BERNHARDT v. POLYGRAPHIC COMPANY
OF AMERICA, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 49.

Argued December 5, 1955.-Decided January 16, 1956.

Petitioner's action against respondent in a Vermont state court, for
damages for the discharge of petitioner under an employment
contract, was removed to the Federal District Court on grounds
of diversity of citizenship. The contract had been made in New
York, where both parties resided at the time, and provided that
the parties would submit any dispute to arbitration under New
York law; but petitioner had later become a resident of Vermont,
where he was to perform his duties. Respondent's motion for a
stay of the proceedings so that the controversy could go to arbitration in New York was denied by the District Court, which ruled
that the arbitration provision of the contract was governed by
Vermont law and that, under Vermont law, the agreement to
arbitrate was revocable any time before an award was actually
made. The Court of Appeals rel'ersed. Held: The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the
District Court. Pp. 199-205.
1. The provision of § 3 of the United States Arbitration Act for
stay of the trial of an action until arbitration has been had does
not apply to all arbitration agreements but only to those covered
by §§ 1 and 2 of the Act (those relating to maritime transactions
and those involving interstate or foreign commerce), and there is
no showing that the contract here involved is in either of those
classes. Pp. 200-202.
2. The differences between arbitration and judicial determination of a controversy substantially affect the cause of action arising
under state law and make the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,
304 U. S. 64, applicable. Pp. 202-204.
3. If in this case arbitration could not be compelled in the Vermont state courts, it should not be compelled in the Federal District Court. Pp. 204-205.
4. In the circumstances of this case, there is no reason to remand
the case to the Court of Appeals to pass on the question of local
law. P. 205.
5. On remand of the cause to the District Court; there will be
open for consideration the question whether New York arbitration

law should be applied to the enforcement of the contract-a question of conflict of laws governed by Vermont law and on which it
is not clear that the District Court ruled. P. 205.

Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr. and Eugene V. Clark argued
the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.

cause for respondent. On the brief were Guy M. Page

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This suit, remov-d from a Vermont court to the District Court on grounds of diversity of citizenship, was
brought for damages for the discharge of petitioner under
an employment contract. At the time the contract was
made petitioner was a resident of New York. Respondent is a New York corporation. The contract was made
in New York. Petitioner later became a resident of
Vermont, where he was to perform his duties under the
contract, and asserts his rights there.
The contract contains a provision that in case of any
dispute the parties will submit the matter to arbitration
under New York law by the American Arbitration Association, whose determination "shall be final and absolute."
After the case had been removed to the District Court,
respondent moved for a stay of the proceedings so that
the controversy could go to arbitration in New York.
The motion alleged that the law of New York governs
the question whether the arbitration provision of the
contract is binding.
The District Court ruled that under Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, the arbitration provision of the
contract was governed by Vermont law and that the law
of Vermont makes revocable an agreement to arbitrate

at any time before an award is actually made. The District Court therefore denied the stay, 122 F. Supp. 733.
The Court of Appeals reversed, 218 F. 2d 948. The case
is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted, 349
U. S. 943, because of the doubtful application by the
Court of Appeals of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra.
A question under the United States Arbitration Act,
43 Stat. 883, as amended, 61 Stat. 669, 9 U. S. C. §§ 1-3,
lies at the threshold of the case. Section 2 of that Act
makes "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable" provisions for
arbitration in certain classes of contracts; 1 and § 3 provides for a stay of actions in the federal courts of issues
referable to arbitration under those contracts.2 Section 2
makes "valid, irrevocable, and enforceable" only two
types of contracts: those relating to a maritime transaction and those involving commerce. No maritime transaction is involved here. Nor does this contract evidence
"a transaction involving commerce" within the meaning
of § 2 of the Act. There is no showing that petitioner
ISection 2 provides:
"A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract
evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration
a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or
the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement
in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising
out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in
equity for the revocation of any contract."
2 Section 3 provides:
"If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the
United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is
pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or
proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall
on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until
such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the
agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in
proceeding with such arbitration."

BERNHARDT v. POLYGRAPHIC CO.

Opinion of the Court.

while performing his duties under the employment contract was working "in" commerce, was producing goods
for commerce, or was engaging in activity that affected
commerce, within the meaning of our decisions!
The Court of Appeals went on to hold that in any event
§ 3 of the Act stands on its own footing. It concluded
that while § 2 makes enforceable arbitration agreements in
maritime transactions and in transactions involving commerce, § 3 covers all arbitration agreements even though
they do not involve maritime transactions or transactions
in commerce. We disagree with that reading of the Act.
Sections 1, 2, and 3 are integral parts of a whole. To be
sure, § 3 does not repeat the words "maritime transaction"
or "transaction involving commerce," used in §§ 1 and 2.
But §§ 1 and 2 define the field in which Congress was legislating. Since § 3 is'a part of the regulatory scheme, we
can only assume that the "agreement in writing" for arbitration referred to in § 3 is the kind of agreement which
§§ 1 and 2 have brought under federal regulation. There
is no intimation or suggestion in the Committee Reports
that §§ 1 and 2 cover a narrower field than § 3. On the
contrary, S. Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2, states
that § 1 defines the contracts to which "the bill will be
applicable." And H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st
s Section 1 defines "commerce" as:
commerce among the several States or with foreign nations,
or in any Territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between any such Territory and another, or between any such
Territory and any State or foreign nation, or between the District of
Columbia and any State or Territory or foreign nation, but nothing
herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen,
railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign
or interstate commerce."
Since no transaction involving commerce appears to be involved
here, we do not reach the further question whether in any event petitioner would be included in "any other class of workers" within the
exceptions of § 1 of the Act.

OCTOBER TERM, 1955.
Opinion of the Court.

350 U. S.

Sess., p. 1, states that one foundation of the new regulating
measure is "the Federal control over interstate commerce
and over admiralty." If respondent's contention is correct, a constitutional question might be presented. Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins indicated that Congress does not have
the constitutional authority to make the law that is applicable to controversies in diversity of citizenship cases.
Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service
Corp., 293 U. S. 449, applied the Federal Act in a diversity
case. But that decision antedated Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins; and the Court did not consider the larger question
presented here-that is, whether arbitration touched on
substantive rights, which Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins held
were governed by local law, or was a mere form of procedure within the power of the federal courts or Congress
to prescribe. Our view, as will be developed, is that § 3,
so read, would invade the local law field. We therefore
read § 3 narrowly to avoid that issue. Federal Trade
Commission v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U. S. 298, 307.
We conclude that the stay provided in § 3 reaches only
those contracts covered by §§ 1 and 2.
The question remains whether, apart from the Federal
Act, a provision of a contract providing for arbitration is
enforceable in a diversity case.
The Court of Appeals, in disagreeing with the District
Court as to the effect of an arbitration agreement under
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, followed its earlier decision
of Murray Oil Products Co. v. Mitsui & Co., 146 F. 2d
381, 383, which held that, "Arbitration is merely a form
of trial, to be adopted in the action itself, in place of the
trial at common law: it is like a reference to a master,
or an 'advisory trial' under Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure . ..

.

We disagree with that conclusion. We deal here with
a right to recover that owes its existence to one of the
States, not to the United States. The federal court en-

BERNHARDT v. POLYGRAPHIC CO.

Opinion of the Court.

forces the state-created right by rules of procedure which
it has acquired from the Federal Government and which
therefore are not identical with those of the state courts.
Yet, in spite of that difference in procedure, the federal
court enforcing a state-created right in a diversity case is,
as we said in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S.99,
108, in substance "only another court of the State." The
federal court therefore may not "substantially affect the
enforcement of the right as given by the State." Id., 109.
If the federal court allows arbitration where the state
court would disallow it, the outcome of litigation might
depend on the courthouse where suit is brought. For the
remedy by arbitration, whatever its merits or shortcomings, substantially affects the cause of action created by
the State. The nature of the tribunal where suits are tried
is an important part of the parcel of rights behind a cause
of action. The change from a court of law to an arbitration panel may make a radical difference in ultimate result. Arbitration carries no right to trial by jury that is
guaranteed both by the Seventh Amendment and by Ch. 1:
Art. 12th, of the Vermont Constitution. Arbitrators do
not have the benefit of judicial instruction on the law;
they need not give their reasons for their results; the
record of their proceedings is not as complete as it is
in a court trial; and judicial review of an award is more
limited than judicial review of a trial-all as discussed in
Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S.427, 435-438.' We said in the
4 Whether the arbitrators misconstrued a contract is not open to
judicial review. The Hartbridge,62 F. 2d 72; Mutual Benefit Health
& Acc. Assn. v. United Cas. Co., 142 F. 2d 390. Questions of fault
or neglect are solely for the arbitrators' consideration. James Richardson & Sons v. W. E. Hedger TransportationCorp., 98 F. 2d 55.
Arbitrators are not bound by the rules of evidence. Burchell v.
Marsh, 17 How. 344; Springs Cotton Mills. v. Buster Boy Suit Co.,

York case that "The nub of the policy that underlies
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins is that for the same transaction
the accident of a suit by a non-resident litigant in a federal
court instead of in a State court a block away should not
lead to a substantially different result." 326 U. S., at 109.
There would in our judgment be a resultant discrimination if the parties suing on a Vermont cause of action in
the federal court were remitted to arbitration, while those
suing in the Vermont court could not be.
The District Court found that if the parties were in a
Vermont court, the agreement to submit to arbitration
would not be binding and could be revoked at any time
before an award was made. He gave as his authority
Mead's Admx. v. Owen, 83 Vt. 132, 135, 74 A. 1058, 1059,
and Sartwell v. Sowles, 72 Vt. 270, 277, 48 A. 11, 14,
decided by the Supreme Court of Vermont. In the Owen
case the court, in speaking of an agreement to arbitrate,
held that ". . . either party may revoke the submission at
any time before the publication of an award." 83 Vt.,
at 135, 74 A., at 1059. That case was decided in 1910.
But it was agreed on oral argument that there is no
later authority from the Vermont courts, that no fracture in the rules announced in those cases has appeared
in subsequent rulings or dicta, and that no legislative
movement is under way in Vermont to change the
result of those cases. Since the federal judge making
those findings is from the Vermont bar, we give special
weight to his statement of what the Vermont law is.,' See
Pecan Sales Co., 144 F. 2d 448; The Guldborg, 1 F. Supp. 380;
Springs Cotton Mills v. Buster Boy Suit Co., supra. Absent agreement of the parties, a written transcript of the proceedings is unnecessary. A. 0. Andersen Trading Co. v. Brimberg, 119 Misc. 784, 197

witnesses may not be required. Application of Shapiro,supra. And

MacGregor v. State Mutual Co., 315 U. S. 280; Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620, 630; Steele v. General
Mills, 329 U. S. 433, 439. We agree with him that if
arbitration could not be compelled in the Vermont courts,
it should not be compelled in the Federal District Court.
Were the question in doubt or deserving further canvass,
we would of course remand the case to the Court of Appeals to pass on this question of Vermont law. But, as
we have indicated, there appears to be no confusion in
the Vermont decisions, no developing line of authorities
that casts a shadow over the established ones, no dicta,
doubts or ambiguities in the opinions of Vermont judges
on the question, no legislative development that promises
to undermine the judicial rule. We see no reason, therefore, to remand the case to the Court of Appeals to pass
on this question of local law.
Respondent argues that since the contract was made in
New York and the parties contracted for arbitration under
New York law, New York arbitration law should be applied to the enforcement of the contract. A question of
conflict of laws is tendered, a question that is also governed by Vermont law. See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co.,
313 U. S. 487. It is not clear to some of us that the
District Court ruled on that question. We mention it
explicitly so that it will be open for consideration on
remand of the cause to the District Court.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and
the cause is remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.

Vermont, against respondent, a corporation of the State
of New York. Respondent removed the case to the
United States District Court for the District of Vermont.
The subject matter of the litigation is a contract made
between the parties in New York, and the sole basis of
the jurisdiction of the District Court is diversity of citizenship. Not only was the contract made in New York,
but the parties agreed to the following provision in it:
"Fourteenth: The parties hereto do hereby stipulate and agree that it is their intention and covenant
that this agreement and performance hereunder and
all suits and special proceedings hereunder be construed in accordance with and under and pursuant
to the laws of the State of New York and that in any
action special proceeding or other proceeding that
may be brought arising out of, in connection with
or by reason of this agreement, the laws of the State
of New York shall be applicable and shall govern to
the exclusion of the law of any other forum, without
regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or
special proceeding may be instituted."
Respondent invoked another provision of the contract
whereby disputes under the agreement were to be submitted to arbitration subject to the regulations of the
American Arbitration Association and the pertinent provisions of the New York Arbitration Act. It did so by a
motion to stay the proceeding in the District Court pending arbitration.
The District Court denied the stay because, on its reading of the Vermont cases, Vermont law, while recognizing
the binding force of such an agreement by way of a suit
for damages, does not allow specific performance or a stay
pending arbitration. It rested on a decision rendered by
the Supreme Court of Vermont in a bill for an accounting

evidently between two Vermonters and relating wholly to
a Vermont transaction, i. e., a controversy about personal
property on a Vermont farm. Mead's Admx. v. Owen,
83 Vt. 132, 74 A. 1058.' This case was decided in 1910
and, in turn, relied on Aspinwall v. Tousey, 2 Tyler (Vt.)
328, decided in 1803, authorizing revocation of a submission to arbitration at any time before the publication of
an award.
The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to consider
what the Vermont law was today, for it held that the
arbitration provision did not concern a matter of "substantive" law, for which, in this diversity case, Vermont
law would be controlling on the United States District
Court sitting in Vermont. It held that the arbitration
provision fell within the law of "procedure" governing an
action in the federal court, whatever the source of the
jurisdiction. So holding, the Court of Appeals found § 3
'if the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 3,
applicable and, accordingly, directed the District Court
to heed that Act and allow the matter to go to arbitration.
218 F. 2d 948.
This Court explained in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,
326 U. S. 99, why the categories of "substance" and "procedure" are, in relation to the application of the doctrine
of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, less than selfdefining. They are delusive. The intrinsic content of
what is thought to be conveyed by those terms in the particular context of a particular litigation becomes the essential inquiry. This mode of approaching the problem
has had several applications since the York decision. I
agree with the Court's opinion that the differences between arbitral and judicial determination of a controversy under a contract sufficiently go to the merits of the

outcome, and not merely because of the contingencies of
different individuals passing on the same question, to
make the matter one of "substance" in the sense relevant
for Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins. In view of tie ground that
was taken in that case for its decision, it would raise a
serious question of constitutional law whether Congress
could subject to arbitration litigation in the federal courts
which is there solely because it is "between Citizens of
different States," U. S. Const., Art. III, § 2, in disregard
of the law of the State in which a federal court is sitting.
Since the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 does not
obviously apply to diversity cases, in the light of its terms
and the relevant interpretive materials, avoidance of the
constitutional question is for me sufficiently compelling
to lead to a construction of the Act as not applicable to
diversity cases. Of course this implies no opinion on
the constitutional question that would be presented were
Congress specifically to make the Arbitration Act applicable in such cases. Furthermore, because the Act is not
here applicable, I abstain from any consideration of the
scope of its provisions in cases which are in federal courts
on a jurisdictional basis other than diversity of citizenship.
Vermont law regarding such an arbitration agreement
as the one before us, therefore, becomes decisive of the
litigation. But what is Vermont law? One of the difficulties, of course, resulting from Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,
is that it is not always easy and sometimes difficult to
ascertain what the governing state law is. The essence
of the doctrine of that case is that the difficulties of ascertaining state law are fraught with less mischief than disregard of the basic nature of diversity jurisdiction,
namely, the enforcement of state-created rights and state
2

293 U. S. 449, was a diversity case wherein § 3 of the Arbitration Act
was applied. But the case was pre-Erie, and the Court's attention
was not directed toward the question.

policies going to the heart of those rights. If Judge Gibson's statement of what is the contemporary Vermont
law relevant to the arbitration provision now before him
were determinative, that would be that. But the defendant is entitled to have the view of the Court of Appeals
on Vermont law and cannot, under the Act of Congress,
be foreclosed by the District Court's interpretation.
As long as there is diversity jurisdiction, "estimates"
are necessarily often all that federal courts can make in
ascertaining what the state court would rule to be its law.3
See Pomerantz v. Clark, 101 F. Supp. 341. This Court
ought not to by-pass the Court of Appeals on an issue
which, if the Court of Appeals had made a different
estimate from the District Court's, of contemporaneous Vermont law regarding such a contract as the one
before us, this Court, one can confidently say, would
not have set its view of Vermont law against that of the
Court of Appeals. For the mere fact that Vermont in
1910 restated its old law against denying equitable relief
for breach of a promise to arbitrate a contract made
under such Vermont law, is hardly a conclusive ground
for attributing, to the Vermont Supreme Court application of this equitable doctrine in 1956 to a contract
made in New York with explicit agreement by the parties
that the law of New York which allows such a stay as was
here sought, New York Civil Practice Act, § 1451, should
govern. Cf. Brown v. Perry, 104 Vt. 66, 156 A. 910. Law
does change with times and circumstances, and not merely
through legislative reforms. 4 It is also to be noted that
It is peculiarly true of the problem before us, that law is a

prophecy "of what the courts will do in fact." Holmes, The Path
of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers, p. .173.
4 That the Vermont Supreme Court does not obstinately adhere
to its past decisions, that for it too law is living, is illustrated by the
following instances: Capello's Administrator v. Aero Mayflower
Transit Co., 116 Vt. 64, 68 A. 2d 913, overruling Ronan v. Turnbull

law is not restricted tv what is found in Law Reports, or
otherwise written. See Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v.
Browning, 310 U. S. 362, 369. The Supreme Court of
Vermont last spoke on this matter in 1910. The doctrine
that it referred to was not a peculiar indigenous Vermont

rule.

The attitude reflected by that decision nearly half

a century ago was the current traditional judicial hostility against ousting courts, as the phrase ran, of their
jurisdiction. See the adverse comments of Judge Hough

in United States Asphalt Refining Co. v. Trinidad Lake
Petroleum Co., Ltd., 222 F. 1006, against what he assumed
to be the law in the federal courts, and compare with the
shift in judicial attitude reflected by the reservation of this

is not the same as the character of the right which existed at common
law. The opinion draws upon the recorded attitude of other jurisdictions to justify its departure from the contrary theory which it had
set forth in Kelley v. Hoosac Lumber Co., 96 Vt. 153, 118 A. 520.

question in Mr. Justice Brandeis' opinion for the Court
in Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 264-U. S. 109.1
To be sure, a vigorous legislative movement got under
way in the 1920's expressive of a broadened outlook of
view on this subject. But courts do not always wait for
legislation to find a judicial doctrine outmoded. Only
last Term, although we had no statute governing an adjudication, we found significance in a relevant body of
enactments elsewhere: "A steady legislative trend, presumably manifesting a strong social policy, properly
makes demands on the judicial process." National City
Bank of New York v. Republic of China, 348 U. S. 356,

360.
Surely in the light of all that hes happened since 1910
in the general field of the law of arbitration, it is not for
us to assume that the Court of Appeals, if it had that
question for consideration, could not have found that the
law of Vermont today does not require disregard of a pro5 Judge Hough, in 1915, stated:
"It has never been denied that the hostility of English-speaking
courts to arbitration contracts probably originated (as Lord Campbell
said in Scott v. Avery, 4 H. L. Cas. 811)-'in the contests of the courts
of ancient times for extension of jurisdiction-all of them being
opposed to anything that would altogether deprive every one of
them of jurisdiction.'
"A more unworthy genesis cannot be imagined. Since (at the
latest) the time of Lord Kenyon, it has been customary to stand
rather upon the antiquity of the rule than upon its excellence or
-reason . . . ." 222 F., at 1007.
"I think the decisions cited show beyond question that the Supreme
Court has laid down the rule that such a complete ouster of jurisdiction as is shown by the clause quoted [the arbitration clause] . .
is void in a federal forum." 222 F., at 1012.
On the other hand, in 1924 this Court observed in Red Cross Line:
"we have no occasion to consider whether the unwillingness of the
federal courts to give full effect to executory agreements for arbitration can be justified." 264 U. S., at 125.

desire to have the law of New York govern, to accomplish
a result that today may be deemed to be a general doctrine of the law. Of course, if the Court of Appeals,
versed in the general jurisprudence of Vermont and having among its members a Vermont lawyer, should find
that the Vermont court would, despite the New York
incidents of the contract, apply Vermont law and that
it is the habit of the Vermont court to adhere to its precedents and to leave changes to the legislature, it would not
be for the federal court to gainsay that policy. I am not
suggesting what the Court of Appeals' answer to these
questions would be, still less what it should be. I do
maintain that the defendant does have the right to have
the judgment oi the Court of Appeals on that question
and that it is not for us to deny him that right.
I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for its
determination of Vermont law on matters which the basis
of its decision heretofore rendered it needless to consider.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN,

concurring.

I concur in the opinion of the Court except insofar as
it undertakes to review and affirm the District Court's
interpretation of Vermont law. I agree with MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

that the review of questions of state

law should ordinarily be left to the Courts of Appeals and
would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for that
purpose.
MR. JUSTICE BURTON,

dissenting.

Whether or not § 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act is
applicable to this contract, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be affirmed.
Assuming the validity of the arbitration clause in the
New York contract here involved, I regard the procedure

BERNHARDT v. POLYGRAPHIC CO.

BURTON,

J., dissenting.

which it prescribes as a permissible "form of trial." See
Murray Oil Products Co. v. Mitsui & Co., 146 F. 2d 381.
Accordingly, the United States District Court for the District of Vermont may stay its own proceedings to await
completion of the arbitration proceedings, although a
state court of Vermont would not do likewise. I do not
interpret Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, or
Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, as requiring
the contrary.
