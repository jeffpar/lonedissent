OCTOBER TERM, 1966.
May 15, 1967.

387 U.S.

HOLDING, DBA GRAND NEWS v.
BLANKENSHIP ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 1088.

Decided May 15, 1967.

259 F. Supp. 694, reversed in part and appeal dismissed and certiorari
denied in part.

Samuel W. Block, Thomas P. Sullivan and Paul C.
Duncan for appellant.
PER CURIAM.

Probable jurisdiction noted as to Question 1. The
judgment of the District Court for the Western District
of Oklahoma entered November 4, 1966, is reversed insofar
as it adjudged provisions of §§ 1040.1 to 1040.10 of
Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes to be constitutional.
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58. Treating
the nonappealable issue presented by Question 2 as if
contained in a petition for a writ of certiorari, the petition is denied. See Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,
512.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the denial of certiorari
as to Question 2, but would affirm the judgment of the
District Court as to Question 1.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE would note probable jurisdiction
and set the case for oral argument.
