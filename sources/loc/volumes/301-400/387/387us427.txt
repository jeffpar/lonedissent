George Wakefield and Martin E. Weekes for appellees
Younger et al.; and Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General

PER CURIAM.

Appellants seek review by this Court of the refusal
by the District Court to convene a three-judge District
Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281-2284. We have
held that such review is available in the Court of Appeals,
Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U. S.
713, and not in this Court. Buchanan v. Rhodes, 385
U. S. 3.
The motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
