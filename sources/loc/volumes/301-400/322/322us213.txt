KANSAS v. MISSOURI.
Opinion of the Court.

KANSAS v. MISSOURI.
BILL IN EQUITY.

No. 9, original. Argued January 31, 1944.-Decided May 8, 1944.
Upon the evidence in this case, in which Kansas claims title to certain
land now lying on the Missouri side of the Missouri River in the
Forbes Bend area, Kansas has failed to show that, at any time
during the period in question, the main channel of the Missouri
River shifted from a course such as the river now follows (or one
slightly closer to the Kansas bluffs) to one following the course of
the channel on the Missouri side when the flow was divided. Therefore the land in dispute must be awarded to Missouri, and the
boundary will be fixed in accordance with the recommendations of
the Special Master. Pp. 214, 232.

Court.
Kansas brings this original suit against Missouri to have
determined their common boundary from the mouth of
the Kaw or Kansas River northwardly, over a distance of
approximately 128 miles, along the channel of the Missouri River to its intersection with Kansas' north boundary line.
At the time of Kansas' admission to the Union, January
29, 1861, the western boundary of Missouri followed the

thread of the Missouri River, that is, the middle line of its
main navigable channel, between these points.1 This line
then became the common boundary of the two states.2
The bill of complaint was filed in 1940. It alleged that
the thread of the stream had shifted frequently, sometimes
suddenly, sometimes gradually, and that these changes
had caused controversies concerning the true boundary.
When the proceeding began it was in dispute at a number
of places.' But during pendency of the suit the parties
have settled all differences except one. This relates to
the section of the boundary in the Forbes Bend region.4
After the filing of the suit a master was appointed. Extensive hearings were held. Both documentary and oral
evidence was presented. The master has filed his report,
which makes findings and conclusions in favor of Missouri.
Kansas says these are contrary to the law and to the
weight of the evidence.
The land in dispute consists of about 2,000 acres. This
now lies on the Missouri side of the river toward the lower
end of Forbes Bend. Kansas claims this land was at one
time soil accreted to the Kansas bank, which an avulsive
change in the course of the main channel has put back on
the Missouri side; or, in the alternative, that the tract

Attempts at settlement by negotiation had been authorized by
Kansas before this proceeding was begun (Laws of Kansas, 1939, c.
355). Apparently they were unavailing, and this suit was instituted.
After it was begun, however, the parties agreed to a settlement with
respect to all areas but this one and incorporated it in this record. It

will be made part of the decree.

formed as an island on the Kansas side of the main channel
and, as a result of a sudden shift in that channel to the
other side of the island and the drying up of the old course,
it has become physically attached to Missouri. In either
event, Kansas urges, it follows that the boundary remains
at the center of the river's former main channel. Missouri
denies that the land accreted to Kansas, that there was
avulsion, or that the island ever lay on the Kansas side
of the main channel.
The States are not in dispute about the applicable law.
They agree that when changes take place by the slow and
gradual process of accretion the boundary moves with the
shifting in the main channel's course.' Likewise, they
agree that a sudden or avulsive change in that course
does not move the boundary, but leaves it where the
channel formerly had run.'
However, the parties are sharply at odds over the facts
and the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence. In
view of this and since we think the facts as presented by
the evidence are conclusive of the controversy, it becomes
necessary to sketch them and to refer to portions of the
evidence in order to give an understanding of the issues
and the basis for our conclusions.

Forbes Bend lies between Doniphan County, Kansas,
and Holt County, Missouri. The disputed boundary, according to the master's findings, extends along the main
channel of the river as it now flows for a distance of about
five miles bending southeasterly from Channel Mileage
Station 515 to Station 510 (as measured and marked in

1890). As the river enters Forbes Bend from the north
it flows east of south. Near the point of entrance it is
joined by Wolf Creek. This comes into the river from
the Kansas side in an easterly direction. The mouth of
Wolf Creek is roughly adjacent to Station 515. From
this point the Kansas bluffs swing in a gradual convex
curve southeasterly until they reach a point above Station
510. On the Missouri side the bluffs run, as they do on
the Kansas side, generally southeasterly. Throughout
the Forbes Bend region'the distance as the crow flies from
the Kansas bluffs to the Missouri bluffs is four milesj more
or less. Adjacent to and parallel with the Missouri bluffs,
but between them and the river, lie tracks of the Burlington
Railroad.
The Missouri River is a vagrant, turbulent stream. Its
name reflects this character. The Big Muddy is said to
carry more silt than any other river except the Yellow
River in China. It is constantly changing its course
within the region between its bluffs, shifting from side to
side as natural forces work upon its flow. Expert testimony is that a change of conditions in one bend produces
changes as great, or nearly so, in the next bend below.
The river flows around a big bend, known as Wolf Creek
Bend, just before it reaches the mouth of Wolf Creek.
Here it runs almost due south. It is conceded by all that
in 1900 the river flowed southeasterly in a single channel
from the mouth of Wolf Creek, hugging the Kansas bluffs
throughout the entire course of flow to Station 510. As
it presently flows, the river makes a wide arc, first to the
left or Missouri bank in a course almost due east or north
of east, before it turns sharply to the south again at a point
midway between the bluffs, and follows this southerly
course until it strikes the old main channel at the Kansas
bluffs above Station 510. This bend now is in the form
of a bow, with the river proper forming the bow and the old
channel along the Kansas bank its string. Roughly,

KANSAS v. MISSOURI.
213

Opinion of the Court.

therefore, the difference between the present flow through
Forbes Bend and the flow in 1900 is the difference between
the bow and the string. At the center of the bow the distance between the old channel and the present one appears
to be at most one mile.
However, as will appear, the channel's present location
results from more complex changes than merely a movement of the river north and east over the distance lying
between these two channels. According to the greatly
preponderant though not undisputed evidence, there was a
division of channels in Forbes Bend from about 1914 or
1917 to 1927 or 1928. During this time the more westerly
or Kansas channel lay slightly west of where the present
channel runs. The Missouri or easterly channel lay on the
other side of the area in dispute, which then formed part of
a bar or island. At one time, probably about 1922 or 1923,
during the period of greatest erosion of the Missouri bank,
this channel came within half a mile or less of the Burlington tracks. The Missouri channel, with the river above
it, then followed a course almost due east or slightly north
of east from below the mouth of Wolf Creek to the point of
its closest approach to the railroad. Then it swung
sharply to the south and in a curving line came back to
join the original channel near the Kansas bluffs above
Station 510.
From the recital thus far it is clear that in 1900 the land
which then lay where the disputed tract now lies was Missouri land. This is undisputed. Likewise, the tract now
is attached to Missouri on the easterly bank of the river.
This is because the Missouri channel dried up during some
five to eight years beginning around 1927 or earlier. But,
before that process began, for many years the land in question lay between the two channels. And it is from conflicting views concerning whether, how and when these
major changes took place the parties derive their respective
claims to sovereignty over this soil.

Kansas first claims that the land in dispute became
hers by accretion. Her principal theory is that beginning in 1900 and during a period extending to 1917 or to
1927 the river channel, due to changes upstream, gradually moved out from the Kansas bluffs over a distance
of some three to three and a half miles to the north and
east.' As Missouri soil thus was being cut away, it is said
the land in question was built up gradually on the Kansas
side. In any event, if it was not connected firmly to the
Kansas shore it was separated only by narrow and irregular chutes and sloughs, not by any sort of regular channel.
Then either ,in 1917 8 or in 1927' ice jams forming in the
river caused it suddenly to leave its channel near the Missouri bluffs and to open a new one near where the present
channel runs. Relying upon accretion from 1900 to 1917
or 1927 for acquisition. of the disputed area, Kansas relies
upon avulsion in 1917 or 1927 to prevent losing the area
again to Missouri. Her alternative theory of island formation is relied on in case that of accretion and avulsion
fails on the proof. By this, the island formed on her side
of the main channel and the subsequent shift of the main
7Since Kansas claims avulsive change both in 1917 and in 1927,
and that the accretion began about 1900 or shortly thereafter, her
claim necessarily implies that the period of accretion extended either
from 1900 to 1917 or from 1900 to 1927.
8 At that time, according to this claim, the main channel of the
river flowed through the so-called Missouri channel to the north and
east, but was suddenly changed by the ice jam back from that channel
into a chute on the Kansas side. This chute previously had cut
across the allegedly accreted land a little to the west of where the
present channel now lies. The complaint alleges that the ice jam
occurred "on or about February 1918." The scanty testimony in
the record if completely accepted would establish the ice jam in 1917
rather than in 1918; cf. note 24 infra.
9The complaint alleges that the ice jam occurred "during the year
1927." The witnesses who testify to the jam at this time date it
variously in 1927, 1928 and 1929; cf. note 25 infra.

KANSAS v. MISSOURI.

Opinion of the Court.

flow to the Kansas channel and drying up of the Missouri
channel did not affect her jurisdiction.
Missouri meets all of Kansas' claims with denial on the
facts. She says first that the land in question has been
at no time accreted soil of Kansas. On the contrary, she
claims that the disputed area formed as an island in the
river bed beginning about 19.10 or 1912, and from then
until 1927 or 1928 there was a divided flow around this
island, a Missouri channel running north and east of it
with a Kansas channel to the south and west. She insists
that the Kansas channel always remained the main channel of the stream and only a minor one reached proximity
to the railroad tracks. Accordingly, she says the island
formed as Missouri land and always remained Missouri
territory. Missouri thus opposes her view of island formation, both to Kansas' view of that process and to her
claim of accretion and avulsion.
However, Missouri adds a further argument even if the
Kansas theory of accretion is conceded. According to
this, the effect of the accretion to the Kansas bank is
counteracted by the fact that at no time was there an
avulsive change, whether in 1917 or in 1927. On the contrary the river moved back gradually as it came. In this
view the accretive process working against Missouri ended
in 1923 or 1924, when the Missouri channel reached greatest proximity to the railroad tracks. Beginning in those
years and continuing gradually until 1933 or 1934, the
river moved slowly back to a point beyond the location
of the present channel. Thus purporting to follow the
accretion theory in both directions, Missouri claims the
land in question.
It may be noted that crucial to Kansas' case, whether
on her theory of accretion and avulsion or on that of
island formation, is the need for showing that the main
channel followed the course of the Missouri channel.

II.
Roughly the history of the Bend, for our purposes, may
be divided into three periods, namely, from 1900 to 1917;
from 1917 to 1928; and from 1928 to 1940, when this suit
was begun. There is documentary evidence as well as
oral testimony for the period prior to 1900. There is little or no documentary evidence in the form of maps, photographs, drawings or other materials from 1900 to 1923.
There is a considerable amount of documentary material
from 1923 on.
Perhaps the most important documentary item is a
map of the Forbes Bend region compiled from the field
in 1923 by the United States Engineer Office at Kansas
City, designated as complainant's Exhibit 46 in this record. Another map of considerable assistance, with information penciled on it by two witnesses who testified at
the hearings, is complainant's Exhibit 47. This purports
to show in less detail than Exhibit 46 conditions in the
Bend in 1926. The witnesses' penciled additions, placing
channels and other landmarks, with their testimony, give
considerable information about conditions in the Bend
from 1921 or 1922 on to 1926 and later. Assistance also
is derived from complainant's Exhibit 56. This is an
aerial survey photograph of the Forbes Bend region made
in 1941, showing conditions when this suit was begun.
Reference to these exhibits will be made as the testimony
of some of the witnesses is referred to.
It is clearly established that sometime around 1900,
fixed by some older witnesses variously as beginning
earlier and by others later, the river began a northerly and
eastward movement, cutting away the Missouri bank and
filling in on the Kansas bank."0 Neighborhood testimony
attributes the beginning of this movement to some change

in conditions upstream, taking place apparently around
the mouth of Wolf Creek or in Wolf Creek Bend above."
Whatever this change may have been, it apparently threw
the current of the stream against the solid rock formation
on what is known as Lookout Mountain. This is a point
on the Kansas bluffs about a mile or a mile and a half
below the mouth of Wolf Creek. The current, striking
this rock with force, was thrown over to the north or
Missouri bank.
The soil composition of the north bank is a common
formation in the Missouri River valley. Underneath the
surface soil is sand or quicksand. This is covered by a
layer of gumbo soil. Testimony in the record discloses
there is no great erosion when the water is very high or
very low. But when it is at an intermediate stage the
water comes in contact with the underlying sand, washes
it out, and the topsoil falls into the river in great chunks,
often twenty feet long by ten feet wide. As the current
was forced from the Kansas rock to the Missouri sand, it
undercut more and more of the Missouri soil. Evidence
in the record also shows that between 1900 and 1920, or a
little later, from 4,000 to 5,000 acres of Missouri soil was
washed into the river by this process. On this stood
houses, barns, a school building known as the Baker schoolhouse, and other structures, which either went into the
river as the soil was undermined or were moved to prevent
their falling in. The Baker schoolhouse, which in 1900
was a mile or more northeast from the river bank, was
moved about 1915 to prevent its going into the river. 2

By that time the erosion was moving at great speed and
this continued until the farthest point was reached, a half
mile or less from the Burlington railroad, about 1923 to
1925.13
The clear weight of the evidence is that there was only
a single channel of the river until about 1912 or 1914.
Witnesses for both Kansas and Missouri substantiate
this.' The evidence also clearly establishes that there
was a divided flow from 1917 or earlier to 1927. This too
is substantiated by both Kansas and Missouri witnesses."
The evidence, however, is conflicting concerning when the
division first took place and whether, while it remained,
the Kansas channel or the Missouri channel was the main
one.
Witnesses for Missouri, and some for Kansas, testify
that the division occurred before 1917 and that the two
channels remained substantially equal or the Kansas
channel was the larger in the volume of water carried between the time of the division and sometime between
1922 and 1927 or 1928.18 The Missouri witnesses fairly
uniformly agree that the flow in the two channels was at

least "fifty-fifty" and some of them say the Kansas channel always carried the heavier volume of water. 7 They
also generally agree that the Missouri channel began to
decrease and the Kansas channel to increase in volume
at some time before 1927. Some place the beginning of
this process as early as 1921 or 1922.1 The evidence is
substantial that the decrease in the Missouri flow and the
increase in the Kansas flow began before 1927; and it is
almost unanimous that, from 1928 on, the Missouri channel
contained no current or only the flow of Mill Creek Drainage Ditch, which by that time had been diverted into the
Missouri channel. Witnesses for Missouri attribute a
substantial portion of the filling up of the Missouri channel to deposits made by the Mill Creek Ditch." They
agree, and the evidence for Kansas hardly contradicts
this,' that between 1928 and 1934 the Missouri channel
was the "main river" (Mrs. J. Coufal), that the Kansas channel was
much the larger in 1918 (R. E. Simpson), that most of the water was
on the Kansas side in 1920 (P. Bottiger); cf. C. B. Caton, that the
river was just about evenly divided in 1917 (C. Baskins). Missouri
witnesses said that there was always a substantial flow in the Ransas
channel and that it was about as large as or larger than the Missouri
channel (e. g., Ralph Dyer, B. Hudgins, C. Dinwiddie, J. Fitzgerald,
C. Harper, Raymond Dyer). They placed boats in the Kansas rather
than the Missouri channel (E. McCoy); in 1918 (W. L. Moore); 1916
to 1929 (H. H. Hall); and in 1927 (C. Hudgins).

almost completely dried up. The great preponderance of
the evidence as a whole is that this occurred gradually
over a period of years, varying according to different witnesses from two or three to eight or ten years.
On the other hand, Kansas witnesses are not in accord
among themselves as to what occurred in the Bend between 1912 and 1928. Some of them say there was a
divided flow.' Others deny this but qualify their denials
by asserting that, although the main channel of the river
ran over into Missouri close to the Burlington tracks until
1927, there were chutes on the island and particularly
there was one chute running from about the mouth of
Mill Creek Ditch"as it was in 1917 (directly across northerly from the northern end of the bar or island) due south
to the Kansas bluffs at about Station 510.2 However,
they maintain generally that this was a small chute, or
smaller than the Missouri channel, at any rate up to 1922
or 1923. A few say it was small until 1927 when the
alleged ice jam occurred.2
Soxme witnesses for Kansas maintain that there were big
ice jams in 1917 24 and in 1927.26 Different witnesses
testify to the two alleged jams. Those who say one occurred in 1917 assert that it threw the main flow back
from the Missouri channel into the Kansas channel.

accredit the same consequence to that jam. The two
Kansas theories of avulsion therefore are entirely inconsistent, though each is supported by some evidence. If
there was avulsion in 1917, there hardly could have been
avulsion, on this record, in 1927. On the other hand,
several Kansas witnesses, familiar with the territory during one or both of the two years in question, testify they
saw no ice jams in those years.28 Others say they saw ice
but not in large or unusually large quantities or with unusual effects on the flow of the river."' Nearly all of the
Missouri witnesses deny that there were ice jams either in
those years or at other times, although some refer to ice
in the river as not uncommon in winter or early spring.
The Missouri witnesses are fairly unanimous in saying
that at no time had ice conditions or others caused a sudden change in the river's course 28 and in this they are sup2
ported by a number of Kansas witnesses.
When we turn to complainant's Exhibit 46 we find very
substantial support for Missouri's view that during the
controverted period the flow of the river was divided and
that the Kansas channel equalled or exceeded the Missouri channel in the flow or volume of water carried.
This map, compiled by the Corps of Engineers of the
United States Army, who had charge of the river's development, shows conditions in 1923. Two channels appear,
with a large sand bar or island between them. The map
places the Missouri channel within less than a half mile
of the Burlington tracks. It shows a width of about 1,250
feet at the narrowest point. Soundings, read from the

south end of the island around the curve to its north end,
disclose that the deepest water ran from point to point
as follows: 15 feet, 16 feet, 25 feet, 13 feet, 14 feet. On
the westerly side of the island the Kansas channel was a
little wider at its narrowest point. Its soundings from
south to north at appropriate intervals were 31 feet, 12
feet, 12 feet and 13 feet. The Missouri channel meandered from the south to the east and north and then back
around the north end of the island or bar in a due westerly
direction. On the other hand, the Kansas channel was
much shorter, running straight north from the south end
of the island along its western shore to its northern end.
The map shows that the higher portion of the island was
covered with willows and a small part at the lower end
was under cultivation. Furthermore, it is significant that
at the north end of the island, just opposite the mouth of
Mill Creek Ditch, the water in the Missouri channel was
comparatively shallow.
Exhibit 46 furnishes the most reliable evidence in the
record of conditions in Forbes Bend at a given time. If
only this exhibit and the facts it discloses were considered,
clearly it could not be ruled that the main navigable channel of the river was the Missouri channel. For purposes
of navigation, the Kansas channel was much the shorter
and more direct and, from the soundings as well as the
shorter flow, it apparently carried at least an equal
volume of water.
Exhibit 47, which is described as a revision from airplane photographs, shows in general a somewhat similar
though less detailed picture for 1926. However, two witnesses for Kansas, Kenneth Robinson and Joseph H.
Gray, who hunted in the region from 1920 to 1927 or 1928,
testified concerning this exhibit and marked on it in penciled lines their recollections of the channels' respective
courses in 1922. Their testimony gives perhaps the
strongest support to Kansas' case that the main channel

during a portion of the disputed period was on the Missouri side. But, apart from its inconsistency as to the
location and direction of the Kansas chute," it does not
accord with the more reliable evidence given concerning
conditions in the Bend at the same time by complainant's
Exhibit 46 and it is contradicted by numerous witnesses
for Missouri as well as by some for Kansas jn allocating a
larger flow to the Missouri channel. It cannot therefore
be accepted as controlling.
III.
The evidence need not be stated in further detail. In
our opinion it fully supports the master's ultimate findings and conclusions. It was his -view, first, that there
was no avulsive change, whether in 1917, 1927, or at any
time. He found there was some evidence of an ice jam
in 1917 and more to substantiate such a claim for 1927.
But he also found, and the evidence, though not undisputed, fully substantiates his conclusion, that neither of
these jams was sufficient to cause a sudden change in
the river's course.
There is very considerable doubt, on the record as a
whole, whether the alleged jam in 1917 occurred at all.
80 They

agreed that the Missouri channel flowed around the island
not far from the Burlington tracks, turning south at that point and
flowing against the Kansas bluffs at Station 510. They also agreed
that the Kansas channel was a chute. But they differed concerning
its direction and location. Robinson placed it as running almost due
south across the center of the island in a straight course. Gray placed
the Kansas chute more to the west and with a curving course. Both
testified that the Missouri channel was the main channel at that time.
The inconsistency between Exhibit 46 and the testimony and drawings of Robinson and Gray may be accounted for in part, though not
altogether, by the fact they were in the Bend for hunting and fishing
purposes, chiefly in the fall, whereas Exhibit 46 was made from surveys in June and July. The difference in time, however, is hardly
enough to account for the difference either in width or depth of the
Kansas channel as shown by the exhibit and by their testimony.

OCTOBER TERM, 1943.
Opinion of the Court.

322 U. S.

In any event, the preponderant evidence is that it
amounted to little, if anything, more than the normal piling of ice on the heads of bars and islands during the
spring breakup. 31 There is evidence that this occurred
each year. The proof therefore to sustain avulsion in
1917 is not sufficient and this phase of the case may be
put aside.
We agree with the master that the evidence to show a
more unusual piling up of ice at the head of the island
in 1927 is somewhat stronger.' But we also agree with
him that the evidence as a whole is clearly preponderating
that this did not cause an avulsive change. As has been
stated, there is some evidence that the alleged 1927 jam
caused the main channel of the river to shift then and
suddenly from the Missouri channel to the Kansas channel as the latter flowed from 1927 or 1928 until the Government's revetment work on the river forced the channel to
its present location after 1935. But this is not enough to
sustain Kansas' case.
Both by virtue of her position as complainant and on
the facts, Kansas has the burden of proof in this case. Cf.
Oklahoma v. Texas, 260 U. S. 606. The disputed location
was in Missouri in 1900. It lies on the Missouri side now
and has done so, by practically all the evidence, since
at least 1927 or 1928. These facts put upon Kansas the
burden of showing that in the meantime the land lay on
the Kansas side of the main channel by virtue of natural
changes which were effective to change the jurisdiction.
Kansas has shown beyond doubt that one branch of the
river eroded to a point or points north and east of this
land, probably as early as 1920, possibly earlier. But
beyond this fact, whether on her theory of accretion and
avulsion or on that of island formation, the weight of the
evidence is against her view of what occurred.

KANSAS v. MISSOURI.
213

Opinion of the Court.

Kansas' main difficulty perhaps is that by attempting
to prove one theory of what happened in Forbes Bend she
divides the weight of her evidence and thus goes far to
disprove her other theory. To show accretion and avulsion she was required to prove that the river's main channel moved gradually from the Kansas bluffs in 1900 to
the farthest erosion point in Missouri in 1927, and then
suddenly shifted back to a new channel cut then through
the middle of the accreted soil, leaving the old one from
that time on a minor or dry one. To show sovereignty
by island formation it was necessary to prove that the
island formed on the Kansas side of the main channel,
in which event a subsequent shift in the main flow to the
33
other side of the island would not affect her jurisdiction,
although Missouri's alternative contention seems to be
to the contrary.3 By proving the formation of the island,
Kansas in effect disproves that the disputed area became
accreted soil attached firmly to the Kansas bank. Her
own evidence in this respect, added to that given by Missouri, far outweighs the evidence she presented to show
accretion beyond where the present channel lies and
creates an overwhelming preponderance that the flow
was divided from 1912 or at any rate 1917 to 1927 or 1928;
that the island formed in this period; and thus that the
soil in question was not at any time attached firmly to
the Kansas bank by accretion. If it was formed as island
soil, it was not accreted soil.
Kansas' evidence concerning the division of flow and
formation of the island, together with that concerning

Co., 252 F. 681 (C. C. A.); Commissioners v. United States, 270 F.

1103 ' (C. C. A.).

Missouri apparently urges that even if the land formed as an
island on the Kansas side, the process by which the main channel
shifted from the eastern to the western channel and the former
gradually filled with alluvial deposits thus connecting the island to
the Missouri shore, entitles it to sovereignty over the disputed lands.

the drying up of the Missouri channel, also proves not
that the river suddenly cut a new channel through accreted soil in 1927, but that it merely shifted the volume
of flow from one channel to another preexisting one. In
other words it goes to disprove both accretion and avulsion. Missouri and Kansas witnesses are agreed that the
main flow was in the Kansas channel from 1927 on and
there is substantial agreement that by 1933 or 1935 the
Missouri channel had dried up, except for the flow of
Mill Creek Ditch, and largely had filled up by deposits
from that stream and other forces. Missouri witnesses
say this drying up began before 1927, some as early as
1922 or 1923, and therefore continued for ten or twelve
years. Kansas witnesses generally say it began in 1927
and continued for from three to seven or eight years.
Only a few of them say the ice jam that year cut a new
channel. More testify that the main flow then shifted
from one channel to the other, and some join the witnesses for Missouri in saying that this shift began earlier.
Except for the few witnesses who testify to the sudden
cutting of a new channel, the great weight of the testimony is that whatever change occurred in reduction of
the flow in the Missouri channel required several years
to complete. It was a gradual process, and therefore not
the sudden shift necessary to show avulsion. We need
not decide what the effect would be if the evidence had
shown this was a gradual cutting of a new channel. It
was at most a gradual shifting from one to another. Kansas clearly has failed to prove that there was a single
channel of the river which gradually moved over to the
farthest erosion point, meanwhile accreting this land to
her soil, then suddenly moved back, either in 1917 or
in 1927, to a new channel cut through the accreted soil.
Only by accepting the evidence given by the few witnesses
who supported this theory, which was contradicted both
by the weight of her own evidence concerning island for-

mation -and by substantially all that was offered for
Missouri, could a finding in Kansas' favor be made under
the theory of accretion and avulsion.
Kansas' stronger case upon the proof is on the theory of
island formation. On this, as under that of accretion and
avulsion, it was necessary for her to show that the Missouri
channel was the river's main channel and thus the island,
which is now part of the disputed land, was formed on her
side of the river's thread. On this crucial issue Kansas'
case is stronger perhaps than in any other respect. She
presented substantial evidence to show that while the
river was divided or during some part of that period, more
especially from 1921 or 1922 to 1927, the Missouri channel
was the main one, both in volume of water carried and,
less clearly, in availability for navigation. There is, however, at least an equal weight of evidence, given both by
Missouri witnesses and by some for Kansas, that the
Kansas channel remained the main navigable channel
throughout the period of division.
The evidence on this controlling issue unfortunately is
not as free from conflict or doubt as we might wish. But
it cannot be said, when account is taken of all the evidence,
both oral and documentary, that a preponderance sustains
Kansas' view that the main channel ever changed to the
Missouri side. Kansas' burden required preponderant
proof. She has not made it.
As the case has been made, both the master and this
Court have had to rely upon the inadequate and inconclusive documentary evidence and the conflicting and
often vague recollections of neighborhood witnesses. The
sum does not add up to the weight of proof Kansas was
required to establish in order to prevail. The master saw
and heard the witnesses. His conclusions in all respects
were in favor of Missouri. We find no basis in the record
for any conclusion that he performed his task with other
than fair, disinterested, painstaking effort and attitude.

322 U. S.

His judgment accords with the conclusions we make from
our own independent examination of the record. It is
not necessary for us to decide more than that Kansas has
failed to show that the main channel of the river shifted
at any time in question from a course such as the river
now follows, or one slightly closer to the Kansas bluffs, to
one following the course of the Missouri channel when the
flow was divided.
It follows the land in dispute must be awarded to
Missouri and the boundary will be fixed as the master has
recommended in his report. A decree will be entered
accordingly. [See post, p. 654.]

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 628.

Argued April 25, 1944.-Decided May 15, 1944.

1. It is the duty of the federal appellate courts, as well as the trial
court, to ascertain and apply the state law where that law controls the decision. P. 236.
2. A judgment of a federal court in a case ruled by state law, correctly
applying that law as authoritatively declared by the state courts
when the judgment was rendered, must be reversed on appellate
review if in the meantime the state courts have disapproved their
former rulings and adopted different ones. P. 236.
3. This Court ordinarily will not decide questions of state law which
may conveniently be decided first by the court whose judgment
is here on review. P. 237.
4. Upon review here of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
in a case in which the decision is controlled by state law, it appears
that a decision of the highest court of the State, rendered subsequently to those on which the Circuit Court of Appeals relied, has
at least raised such doubt as to the applicable state law as to require its reexamination. The judgment therefore is vacated and
the cause remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for reconsideration in the light of the subsequent state court decision.
P. 236.
