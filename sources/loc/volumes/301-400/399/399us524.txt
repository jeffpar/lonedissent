OCTOBER TERM, 1969
June 29, 1970

HOYT

ET AL. V.

399 U.S.

MINNESOTA

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF MINNESOTA

No. 1544. Decided June 29, 1970
Certiorari granted; 286 Minn. 92, 174 N. W. 2d 700, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted and the
judgment is reversed, Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN,

with whom

THE CHIEF JUS-

and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.
I am not persuaded that the First and Fourteenth
Amendments necessarily prescribe a national and uniform measure-rather than one capable of some flexibility and resting on concepts of reasonableness-of what
each of our several States constitutionally may do to
regulate obscene products within its borders.
Here a Minnesota trial court (just as the Ohio trial
court did in Walker v. Ohio, 398 U. S. 434 (1970)), endeavored to apply standards articulated by this Court in
prior cases, and embodied in a precisely worded Minnesota statute, and reached the conclusion that the materials in question were obscene within the meaning of
that statutory definition. Six of the seven Justices of
the Supreme Court of that State, citing Redrup v. New
York, 386 U. S. 767 (1967), and other decisions of this
Court, have identified the offending material "for what
it is," have described it as dealing "with filth for the
sake of filth," and have held it obscene as a matter of
law. 286 Minn. 92, 95, 174 N. W. 2d 700, 702. I cannot agree that the Minnesota trial court and those six
justices are so obviously misguided in their holding that

they are to be summarily reversed on the authority of
Redrup.
At this still, for me, unsettled stage in the development
of state law of obscenity in the federal constitutional
context I find myself generally in accord with the views
expressed by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in Roth v. United

States, 354 U. S. 476, 496, 500-503 (1957); Jacobellis v.
Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 203-204 (1964); and Memoirs v.
Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, 455, 458-460 (1966), and
with those enunciated by THE CHIEF JUSTICE in Cain v.

Kentucky, 397 U. S. 319 (1970), and in Walker v. Ohio,

KELLEY v. ARIZONA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF ARIZONA

No. 1232, Misc.
Certiorari granted;
remanded.

Decided June 29, 1970

104 Ariz. 418, 454 P. 2d 563, vacated and

PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The
judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the
Supreme Court of Arizona for further consideration in
light of Chambers v. Maroney, ante, p. 42.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would vacate the judgment and
remand the case to the Supreme Court of Arizona for
the reasons stated in his separate opinion in Chambers
v. Maroney, ante, p. 55.
