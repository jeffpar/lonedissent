REPORTER'S NOTE.

* The next page is purposely numbered 801. The numbers between
796 and 801 were purposely omitted, in order to make it possible to
publish the orders in the current advance sfreets or "preliminary
prints" of the United States Reports with permanent page numbers,
thus making the official citations available immediately.
