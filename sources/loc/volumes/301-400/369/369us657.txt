369 U. S.

May 14, 1962.

The petition for certiorari must be denied. The decision .below and the several prior actions in the Ohio
courts indicate that petitioner is without a state remedy
to challenge his conviction upon the federal constitutional

allegations would therefore entitle him to a hearing.,
