CO. ET AL.
NO. 583.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.*

Argued April 1, 1947.-Decided April 28, 1947.
1. The President's Executive Order No. 9809, issued under § I of the
First War Powers Act of 1941 after the cessation of hostilities but
before the termination of a technical state of war, validly consolidated the Office of Price Administration and three other agencies
into the Office of Temporary Controls. Pp. 113-119.
(a) The war powers are adequate to deal with problems of law
enforcement which arise during the period of hostilities but do
not cease with them. P. 116.
(b) Section 1 of the First War Powers Act, authorizing the
President to redistribute functions among executive agencies, authorizes the creation of a new agency and the consolidation within
it of functions and powers previously exercised by one or more
other agencies. P. 116.
(c) The authority conferred upon the President by § 1 of the
First War Powers Act was not limited to the transfer of functions
from agencies existing when the Act became law. P. 117.
(d) An incumbent of an office "existing by law," within the
meaning of § 2, at the time of the passage of the First War Powers
Act who has once been confirmed by the Senate need not be confirmed again in order to exercise powers transferred to him by the
President from another officer appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Senate. P. 118.
2. Under Rule 25 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the Temporary
Controls Administrator was properly substituted for the Price Administrator in pending enforcement proceedings after the lifting
of most price controls--there being "substantial need" for continuing and maintaining enforcement proceedings previously

Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, announced by MR.

JUSTICE BLACK.

These cases present the question whether the Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 23, as amended, 50
U. S. C. App. Supp. V, § 901 et seq., authorizes the Administrator to delegate to district directors authority to sign
and issue subpoenas. In the first of these cases the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such authority did not exist, 156 F. 2d 891; in the second, the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that
it did. 81 U. S. App. D. C. 156, 156 F. 2d 561. The
cases are here on petitions for writs of certiorari which
we granted to resolve the conflict.
First. After we granted the petitions we ordered, on motion of the Acting Solicitor General, that Philip B.
Fleming, Temporary Controls Administrator, be substituted as a party in each case in place of Paul A. Porter,

motion to vacate the order of substitution, a motion which
we deferred to the hearing on the merits.1 The question

has now been briefed and argued and we conclude that the
motion to vacate the order of substitution should be
denied.
The Act was amended in 1946 to provide for its termination not later than June 30, 1947, saving, however, rights
and liabilities incurred prior to the termination date.'
By November 12, 1946, almost all commodities (including
services) were by administrative order 'made exempt from
price control.4 Price control had thus entered a temporary transition period. On December 12, 1946, the President issued an Executive Order "for the purpose of further
effectuating the transition from war to peace and in the
interest of the internal management of the Government."
That order consolidated the Office of Price Administration
and three other agencies into the Office of Temporary Controls '-an agency in the Office for Emergency Management of the Executive Office of the President. The latter
had previously been established pursuant to the Reorgani'60 Stat. 664. Section 1 (b) now provides:
"The provisions of this Act, and all regulations, orders, price schedules, and requirements thereunder, shall terminate on June 30, 1947,
or upon the date of a proclamation by the President, or upon the date
specified in a concurrent resolution by the two Houses of the Congress, declaring that the further continuance of the authority granted
by this Act is not necessary in the interest of the national defense
and security, whichever date is the earlier; except that as to offenses
committed, or rights or liabilities incurred, prior to such termination
date, the provisions of this Act and such regulations, orders, price
schedules, and requirements shall be treated as still remaining in
force for the purpose of sustaining any proper suit, action, or prosecution with respect to any such right, liability, or offense."
3Express provisions for decontrol were added by the 1946 amendments. See, for example, § la (b)-(h).

zation Act of 1939.6 The Executive Order provided a
Temporary Controls Administrator, appointed by the
President, to head the Office of Temporary Controls and
vested in him, inter alia, the functions of the Price Administrator, including the authority to maintain in his own
name civil proceedings, whether or not then pending, relating to matters theretofore under the jurisdiction of the
Price Administrator. Petitioner is the Temporary Controls Administrator appointed by the President.
It is argued that the President had no authority to transfer the functions of the Price Administrator to another
agency and to vest in an officer appointed by the President
the power which the Emergency Price Control Act, § 201,
had conferred upon an Administrator appointed by the
President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. And it is said that even though such authority existed, it came to an end with the cessation of hostilities.
By § 1 of the First War Powers Act of 1941, 55 Stat. 838,
50 U. S. C. App. Supp. V, § 601, the President is
"authorized to make such redistribution of functions
among executive agencies as he may deem necessary,
including any functions, duties, and powers hitherto
by law conferred upon any executive department,
commission, bureau, agency, governmental corporation, office, or officer, in such manner as in his judgment shall seem best fitted to carry out the purposes
of this title, and to this end is authorized to make such
regulations and to issue such orders as he may deem
necessary . . .
That power may be exercised "only in matters relating to
the conduct of the present war," § 1, and expires six
months after "the termination of the war." § 401.

OCTOBER TERM, 1946.
Opinion of the Court.

331 U. S.

On December 31, 1946, after the creation of the Office
of Temporary Controls, the President, while recognizing
that "a state of war still exists," by proclamation declared
The cessation of hosthat hostilities had terminated
tilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was
stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries& W. Co., 251
U. S. 146, 161, that the war power includes the power "to
remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress" and continues during that emergency. Stewart v.
Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507. Whatever may be the reach of
that power, it is plainly adequate to deal with problems of
law enforcement which arise during the period of hostilities
but do not cease with them. No more is involved here.
Section 1 of the First War Powers Act does not explicitly
provide for creation of a new agency which consolidates
the functions and powers previously exercised by one or
more other agencies. But the Act has been repeatedly
construed by the President to confer such authority.8
Such construction by the Chief Executive, being both
contemporaneous and consistent, is entitled to great
weight. See United States v. Jackson, 280 U. S. 183, 193;
Billings v. Truesdell, 321 U. S. 542, 552-553. And the
appropriation by Congress of funds for the use of such
agencies stands as confirmation and ratification of the
action of the Chief Executive. Brooks v. Dewar, 313 U. S.
354, 361.
2714, 12 Fed. Reg. 1.

or to perform new functions: National Housing Agency, Exec. Order

FLEMING v. MOHAWK CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Nor do we think there is merit in the contention that the
First War Powers Act gave the President authority to
transfer functions only from agencies in existence when
that Act became law. It is true that § 1 authorizes the
President "to make such redistribution of functions among
executive agencies as he may deem necessary, including
any functions, duties, and powers hitherto by law conferred upon" any agency. But the latter clause is only
an illustration of the authority granted, not a limitation on
it. It makes clear that the authority extends to existing
agencies as well as to others. That construction is supported by § 5 of the Act which states that upon its termination all executive and administrative agencies "shall exercise the same functions, duties, and powers as heretofore
or as hereafter by law may be provided, any authorization
of the President under this title to the contrary notwithstanding." As stated by the Emergency Court of Appeals,
unless § 1 authorizes the President to redistribute functions of agencies created after the passage of the Act, the
reference in § 5 to functions "hereafter" provided by law
is "wholly meaningless." CaliforniaLima Bean Growers
Assn. v. Bowles, 150 F. 2d 964, 967. Nor is that result
affected by the subsequent enactment of the Emergency
Price Control Act which in § 201 (b) authorized the President to transfer any of the powers and functions of the Office of Price Administration "with respect to a particular
commodity or commodities" to any government agency
having other functions relating to such commodities.
Whatever effect that provision may have, it does not
purport to deal with general enforcement functions
and so restricts in no way the authority of the President
under the First War Powers Act to transfer them. Yet
enforcement functions are all that are involved in the
present cases.

OCTOBER TERM, 1946.
Opinion of the Court.

331 U. S.

We need not decide whether under the First War Powers
Act the President had authority to transfer functions of
an officer who need be confirmed by the Senate to one
appointed by the President without Senate confirmation.
For § 2 of that Act provides:
"That in carrying out the purposes of this title
the President is authorized to utilize, coordinate, or
consolidate any executive or administrative commissions, bureaus, agencies, governmental corporations,
offices, or officers now existing by law, to transfer any
duties or powers from one existing department, commission, bureau, agency, governmental corporation,
office, or officer to another, to transfer the personnel
thereof or any part of it either by detail or assignment, together with the whole or any part of the
records and public property belonging thereto."
The authority to "utilize . . . offices, or officers now existing by law" is sufficient to sustain the transfer of functions under the Executive Order from Porter, resigned,
to Fleming. For prior to the Act Fleming had been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate as
Federal Works Administrator.' He thus was the incumbent of an office "existing by law" at the time of the passage of the Act and by virtue of § 2 could be the lawful
recipient through transfer by the President of the functions of other agencies as well. To hold that an officer,
previously confirmed by the Senate, must be once more
confirmed in order to exercise the powers transferred to
him by the President would be quite inconsistent with the
broad grant of power given the President by the First War
Powers Act. Any doubts on this score would, moreover,
be removed by the recognition by Congress in a recent
appropriation of the status of the Temporary Controls Ad9 December 4, 1941.

ministrator. ° That recognition was an acceptance or
ratification by Congress of the President's action in Executive Order No. 9809. Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United
States, 300 U. S. 297, 301-302; Brooks v. Dewar, supra.
For these reasons Fleming is a successor in office of
Porter and may be substituted as a party under Rule 25,
Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule requires a showing of "substantial need" for continuing and maintaining the action. Though most of the controls have
been lifted, the Act is still in effect. Liabilities incurred
prior to the lifting of controls are not thereby washed out.
United States v. Hark, 320 U. S. 531, 536; Utah Junk Co.
v. Porter, 328 U. S. 39, 44; Collins v. Porter, 328 U. S.
46, 49. And Congress has explicitly provided that accrued rights and liabilities under the Emergency Price
Control Act are preserved whether or not suit is started
prior to the termination date of the Act. 1 If investigation were foreclosed at this stage, such rights as may exist
would be defeated, contrary to the policy of the Act.
Second. We come then to the merits. The Administrator, by order, delegated the function of signing and issuing
1061 Stat. 14, 16, under the heading "Executive

Office of the

President, Office for Emergency Management," the following:
"Office of Temporary Controls
"Salaries and expenses: For an additional amount, fiscal year 1947,
for the Office of Price Administration transferred by Executive Order
9809 of December 12, 1946, to the Office of Temporary Controls,
$7,051,752, to be available for the payment of terminal leave only:
Provided, That it is the intent of the Congress that the funds heretofore and herein appropriated shall include all expenses incident to the
closing and liquidation of the Office of Price Administration and the
Office of Temporary Controls by June 30, 1947."
" See § 1 (b) supra, note 2. And for the general statute preventing the extinguishment of liability under a repealed statute, unless
the repealing act expressly provides for it, see Rev. Stat. § 13, as
amended, 58 Stat. 118, 1 U. S. C. Supp. V, § 29.

subpoenas to regional administrators and district directors."2 Section 201 (a) of the Emergency Price Control
Act provides in part:
"The Administrator may, subject to the civil-service
laws, appoint such employees as he deems necessary in order to carry out his functions and duties
under this Act, and shall fix their compensation
in accordance with the Classification Act of 1923, as
amended."
Section 201 (b) of the Act provides:
"The principal office of the Administrator shall be
in the District of Columbia, but he or any duly authorized representative may exercise any or all of his
powers in any place."
Practically identical provisions were included in § 4 (b)
and (c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060,
1061-1062, 29 U. S. C. § 204. The Court held in Cudahy
Packing Co. v. Holland, 315 U. S.357, that the latter provisions did not authorize the Administrator under that
Act, to delegate his power to sign and issue subpoenas.
Accordingly the main controversy here is whether the
Cudahy decision controls this case. We do not think it
does.
The legislative history of the Act involved in the
Cudahy case showed that a provision granting authority
to delegate the subpoena power had been eliminated when
the bill was in Conference. On the other hand, the Senate
Committee in reporting the bill that became the Emergency Price Control Act described § 201 (a) as authorizing the Administrator to "perform his duties through such
employees or agencies by delegating to them any of the
powers given to him by the bill." And it said that § 201
(b) authorized him or "any representative or other agency

to whom he may delegate any or all of his powers, to exercise such powers in any place." S. Rep. No. 931, 77th
Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 20-21. In the Cudahy case the Act
made expressly delegable the power to gather data and
make investigations, thus lending support to the view that
when Congress desired to give authority to delegate, it
said so explicitly. In the present Act, there is no provision which specifically authorizes delegation as to a particular function. In the Cudahy case, the Act made
applicable to the powers and duties of the Administrator
the subpoena provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, §§ 9 and 10, 38 Stat. 722, 723, 15 U. S. C. §§ 49
and 50, which only authorized either the Commission or
its individual members to sign subpoenas. The subpoena
power under the present Act is found in § 202 (b) 3 and
is not dependent on the provisions of another Act having
a history of its own. The Act involved in the Cudahy
case granted no broad rule-making power. Section 201
(d) of the present Act, however, provides:
"The Administrator may, from time to time, issue
such regulations and orders as he may deem necessary
or proper in order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act."
Such a rule-making power may itself be an adequate
source of authority to delegate a particular function, unless by express provision of the Act or by implication it has
been withheld. See Plapao Laboratories v. Farley, 67
App. D. C. 304, 92 F. 2d 228. There is no provision in
the present Act negativing the existence of such authority,
so far as the subpoena power is concerned. Nor can the
13Section

202 (b) provides in part:
"The Administrator may administer oaths and affirmations and may,
whenever necessary, by subpena require any such person to appear
and testify or to appear and produce documents, or both, at any
designated place."

331 U. S.

absence of such authority be fairly inferred from the history and content of the Act. Thus the presence of the
rule-making power, together with the other factors differentiating this case from the Cudahy case, indicates that
the authority granted by § 201 (a) and (b) should not be
read restrictively.
As stated by the court in Porter v. Murray, 156 F. 2d
781, 786-787, the overwhelming nature of the price control program entrusted to the Administrator suggests that
the Act should be construed so as to give it the administrative flexibility necessary for prompt and expeditious action
on a multitude of fronts. The program of price control
inaugurated probably the most comprehensive legal controls over the economy ever attempted. We would hesitate to conclude that all the various functions granted the
Administrator need be performed personally by him or
under his personal direction. Certainly, so far as the investigative functions were concerned, he could hardly be
expected, in view of the magnitude of the task,i" to exercise

his personal discretion in determining whether a particular
investigation should be launched. Delay might do injury
beyond repair. The pyramiding in Washington of all decisions on law enforcement would be apt to end in paralysis. To tempt the Administrator to solve the problem by
supplying all his offices with subpoenas signed in blank
would not further the development of orderly and responsible administration. These considerations reinforce the
construction of the Act which allows the Administrator authority to delegate his subpoena power.
The other objections to the subpoenas are without
merit.
We reverse the judgment in Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking & Lumber Co., and affirm the judgment in Raley v.
Fleming.
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON,

concurring.

I concur in the opinion and result. But the issue here is
so related to other problems that I desire to state my
grounds.
I would be reluctant to adopt a construction of an Act,
such as the Emergency Price Control Act, which would
certainly impede its administration unless it were necessary to carry out the intent of Congress or to protect
fundamental individual rights.
If the Administrator may not delegate his power to sign
subpoenas but must personally sign all subpoenas issued
in the process of enforcement throughout the United
States, one of two practices would be certain to result. He
might sign large batches of blank subpoenas and turn them
over to subordinates to be filled in over his signature. Or
he might sign batches of subpoenas already made out by
subordinates, probably without reading them and certainly without examining the causes for their issuance or

331 U. S.

the scope of the information required. The personal signature of the Administrator on the subpoena under those
circumstances is no protection to individual rights.
Of all the subpoenas issued by administrative authority, a very small percentage are contested. The important thing for protection of the individual is that when
he does have reasons for resisting obedience he can obtain
a hearing. I am in doubt as to whether under this Act
and the regulations for its administration a person who has
reasons for resisting the subpoena has any administrative
review or remedy. But in any event he cannot be punished for contempt until a court order for its enforcement
has issued and has been disobeyed.
Enforcement of such subpoenas by the courts is not and
should not be automatic. So long as they are subject to
full inquiry at this point it does not seem to me important
to the individual or inconsistent with the policy of Congress that the subpoena issue by a subordinate of the Administrator. If the courts were to be shorn of their power
of independent inquiry before enforcement, and I have
thought we were tending that way, cf. dissent in Penfield
Co. v. S. E. C., 330 U. S. 585, 1 should expect Congress to
intend greater responsibility at the point of original issue.
I concur only because I think adequate judicial safeguards
exist.
