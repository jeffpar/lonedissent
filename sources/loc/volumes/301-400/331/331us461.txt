CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT.*

Argued April 28, 1947.-Decided June 2, 1947.
1. Within the meaning of the Ohio "borrowing statute," the "cause of
action" in a suit brought in Ohio against residents of that State to
enforce their statutory double liability on shares of an insolvent
Kentucky national bank "arose" in Kentucky, and the applicable
statute of limitations was the five-year statute of Kentucky. Pp.
464-468.
2. Within the meaning of the Pennsylvania "borrowing statute," the
"cause of action" in a suit brought in Pennsylvania against a resident of that State to enforce a statutory double liability on shares
of an insolvent Kentucky national bank "arose" in Kentucky, and
the applicable statute of limitations was the five-year statute of
Kentucky. P. 468.
3. The national bank having been authorized to do its banking business in a Kentucky city and not having done business elsewhere,
the fact that its shares were held in the portfolio of a Delaware corporation did not make its business any the less local. P. 467.
4. No federal statute having fixed any period of limitations in respect
of suits to enforce the statutory double liability of shareholders of
insolvent national banks, the statute of limitations of the State in
which the suit is brought applies. P. 463.
5. Where the concurrent jurisdiction of equity to enforce a legal
obligation derives only from the scope of the relief sought and the
multitude of the parties sued, equity will withhold relief if the
applicable statute of limitations would bar the concurrent legal
remedy. Pp. 463-464.

certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

6. Although the period in which a suit to enforce the statutory double
liability of a shareholder of an insolvent national bank must be
brought is governed by state statutes of limitation, the question of
when the period begins to run depends upon when, under federal
law, the Comptroller of the Currency, or his authorized agent, is
empowered by federal law to bring suit. P. 464.
7. In the instant cases, the suits could not be brought by the Comptroller or his agent until the date fixed by the Comptroller for payment, so the period of limitations did not begin to run until that
date. P. 464.
156 F. 2d 972, reversed.
156 F. 2d 47, affirmed.

No. 593. A suit brought against petitioner to enforce
a statutory double liability on shares in an insolvent national bank was dismissed by the District Court as barred
by limitations. 62 F. Supp. 705. The Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed. 156 F. 2d 972. This Court granted
certiorari. 329 U. S. 707. Reversed, p. 468.
No. 656. In a suit against respondents to enforce a
statutory double liability on shares of an insolvent national bank, a motion to dismiss on the ground, inter alia,
that the suit was barred by limitations was overruled by
the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 156 F. 2d 47. This Court granted certiorari.
329 U. S. 707. Affirmed, p. 468.
Harold Evans argued the cause for petitioner in No. 593.
With him on the brief was John Wintersteen.
Robert S. Marx argued the cause for petitioner in No.

No. 656. With him on the brief were Robert P. Goldman
and Joseph A. Segal.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK

delivered the opinion of the Court.

In Anderson v. Abbott, 321 U. S. 349, we held that the
shareholders of BancoKentucky Company, a bank-stockholding company, were liable under 12 U. S. C. §§ 63, 64,
for an assessment on shares of an insolvent national bank
held in the portfolio of the holding company. That suit
was brought in a Kentucky District Court against Banco
stockholders residing in that District. These suits in
equity were brought in Federal District Courts in Ohio
and Pennsylvania to enforce assessments against Ohio and
Pennsylvania stockholders of Banco. In No. 656 the District Court in Ohio overruled a motion to dismiss made on
the ground, among others, that the bill showed on its face
that the action was barred by an Ohio statute of limitations.1 The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.
156 F. 2d 47. In No. 593 the Third Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court in
Pennsylvania which had held the action there barred
by the Pennsylvania statute of limitations. 156 F. 2d
972. We granted certiorari to consider both cases. 329
U. S. 707.
There is no federal statute of limitations fixing the
period within which suits must be brought to enforce the
statutory double liability of shareholders of insolvent national banks. For this reason we look to Ohio and Pennsylvania law to determine the period in which these suits
may be brought. McDonald v. Thompson, 184 U. S. 71;
McClaine v. Rankin, 197 U. S. 154, 158; Rawlings v. Ray,
312 U. S. 96, 97. Even though these suits are in equity,
the states' statutes of limitations apply. For it is only the

IFor convenience, the motion was made by only four defendants
who are respondents here. The case was continued as to the others
pending final disposition of the question concerning the statute of
limitations, the only ground of the motion to dismiss upon which the
District Court passed.

scope of the relief sought and the multitude of parties sued
which give equity concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the
legal obligation here asserted. And equity will withhold
its relief in such a case where the applicable statute of
limitations would bar the concurrent legal remedy. Russell v. Todd, 309 U. S.280, 289 and cases cited. See also
Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99; Holtnberg v.
Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 395-396.
But even though the period in which suit must be
brought is governed by state limitations statutes, we have
previously decided that the question of when the applicable state statute of limitations begins to run depends
upon when, under federal law, the Comptroller of the
Currency, or his authorized agent, is empowered by
federal law to bring suit. And the Comptroller's agent,
the Receiver here, could not bring these actions until the
date for payment fixed by the Comptroller. Rawlings v.
Ray, supra, 98, 99; Fisher v. Whiton, 317 U. S.217, 220,
221. The date for payment fixed by the Comptroller in
this instance was April 1, 1931. These actions were instituted more than five but less than six years after the
payments became due under the Comptroller's assessment
order.
With regard to No. 656, the Ohio proceeding, the Ohio
statute of limitations provides that suit "upon a liability
created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty, shall
be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued." Ohio Gen. Code (Page, 1938) § 11222. This
statute describes the liability sued on here, and if applicable does not bar this suit. But the scope of this general
provision is narrowed by another known as the "borrowing
statute" which reads:
"If the laws of any state or country where the cause
of action arose limits the time for the commencement
of the action to a less number of years than do the

COPE v. ANDERSON.
461

Opinion of the Court.

statutes of this state in like causes of action then
said cause of action shall be barred in this state at
the expiration of said lesser number of years." Ohio
Gen. Code (Page, 1938) § 11234.
If the cause of action arose in Kentucky, the "borrowing
statute" applies Kentucky's statute of limitations, and
this suit is barred. For Kentucky's law requires that an
"action upon a liability created by statute . . . shall be
commenced within five years after the cause of action
accrued." Ky. Rev. Stat. (Baldwin, 1943) § 413.120.
The Receiver contends that the Ohio borrowing statute's language "the laws of any state or country where
the cause of action arose" has reference to "a system of
jurisprudence other than Ohio's," and does not refer "necessarily to territorial limits" within which events occurred
giving rise to an enforceable obligation. The place where
the events giving rise to a cause of action occur is said
to be "important only insofar as the laws of that place
are controlling." Under this argument, the cause of action here could not have "arisen" in any state since the
statutory obligation of shareholders was not imposed or
controlled by state law. Hence, the argument runs, the
Ohio law did not contemplate borrowing any state statute
of limitations in a case where liability is governed by
federal law. And no federal statute of limitations could
be borrowed in this case for none existed. Therefore, it
is argued, only Ohio's general six-year statute of limitations applies.
The consequence of* accepting this contention would
be that the Ohio borrowing statute would have no effect
at all as to suits brought in Ohio state courts to enforce
actions authorized by federal law. For, of course, Ohio
courts could never borrow a non-existent federal statute of
limitations. And if there were a federal statute of limitations governing a federally created right, that statute

would control of its own force. Herget v. Central National Bank & Trust Co., 324 U. S. 4. We have been cited
to no decision by any Ohio court which would lead us to
believe that its borrowing statute should be given such
a sterilizing interpretation. Cf. Townsend v. Eichelberger, 51 Ohio St. 213, 216, 38 N. E. 207, 208.
We find it unnecessary to our decision to discuss the
contentions made here concerning differences between a
"cause of action" and a "liability." The Ohio Supreme Court has itself said that a "cause of action is the
fact or combination of facts which gives rise to a
right of action, the existence of which affords a party a
right to judicial interference in his behalf." Baltimore &
0. R. Co. v. Larwill, 83 Ohio St. 108, 115-116, 93
N. E. 619, 621. We have been referred to nothing in Ohio
statutes or decisions which indicates that it used "cause
of action" in any different sense in its borrowing statute.
The purpose of the state's borrowing statute,' as those
of other states,3 was apparently to require its courts to
bar suits against an Ohio resident if the right to sue him
had already expired in another state where the combination of circumstances giving rise to the right to sue had
taken place. Moreover, limitations on federally created
rights to sue have similarly been considered to be governed by the limitations law of the state where the crucial
combination of events transpired. Seaboard Terminals
Corp. v. Standard Oil Co., 24 F. Supp. 1018, 104 F. 2d 659;
Bluefields S. S. Co. v. United Fruit Co., 243 F. 1, 19-20.
See Campbell v. Haverhill, 155 U. S. 610; Chattanooga

Opinion of the Court.

leading to this suit, persuade us that the cause of action
''arose" in Kentucky within the meaning of the Ohio
borrowing statute. The bank was authorized to do its
banking business in Louisville and did business in no other
place. See 12 U. S. C. § 81. Nor was this bank's business
any the less local because its shares were held in the portfolio of a Delaware corporation. Many provisions of
federal law make national banks, in important aspects,
peculiarly local institutions. See 12 U. S. C. §§ 30, 33,
34 (a), 36, 51, 62, 72. For jurisdictional purposes, a national bank is a "citizen" of the state in which it is established or located, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (16), and in that district
alone can it be sued. 12 U. S. C. § 94. True, when insolvency occurs, there is a shift in bank management, but
the bank's activities are still necessarily rooted in its local
habitat. In this case the Receiver's office was located in
Louisville, the home of the bank; payment of assessments,
like other obligations due the bank, could have been made
there, and, in fact, shareholders were notified by the Receiver to pay at his office in Louisville.4 Liquidation of a
local bank, like its daily operations, must from necessity
and in the interest of good business be carried on, in the
main, in the community where the bank did business with
its depositors and other customers. Practically everything that preceded the final fixing of liability of shareholders derived from Kentucky transactions. We have
been referred to no Ohio decisions, and have been unable
to find any, which contradict our conclusion that events
which culminated in this suit justify our holding that this
"cause of action" "arose" in Kentucky within the meaning
of the Ohio statute. See Hunter v. NiagaraFire Ins. Co.,
73 Ohio St. 110, 76 N. E. 563; Alropa Corp. v. Kirchwehm,
Whether notice by the Receiver to pay at a particular place could
alter the conclusive situation as to where a cause of action might be
considered to "arise" under other circumstances is a question we need
not decide.

138 Ohio St. 30, 33 N. E. 2d 655; Payne v. Kirchwehm, 141
Ohio St. 384, 48 N. E. 2d 224; Bowers v. Holabird,51 Ohio
App. 413, 1 N. E. 2d 326; National Bondholders Corp. v.
Stoddard, 22 Ohio 0. 145, 8 Ohio Supp. 19. See also
Hilliard v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 73 F. 2d 473, 475-476;
Note, 15 U. of Cin. L. Rev. 337 (1941); Note, 21 Ohio 0.
107 (1941). Therefore the judgment in No. 656 is
affirmed.
In No. 593, the Pennsylvania action, the same considerations are controlling. The general statute of limitations of that state which would be applicable to this
action had it arisen in Pennsylvania, like Ohio's general
statute, provides a six-year period in which this suit could
be brought. 12 Pa. Stat. § 31 (Purdon, 1931). But
Pennsylvania also has a "borrowing statute" which provides: "When a cause of action has been fully barred by
the laws of the state or country in which it arose, such bar
shall be a complete defense to an action thereon brought
in any of the courts of this commonwealth." 12 Pa. Stat.
§ 39 (Purdon, 1931). Our review of Pennsylvania decisions construing this statute persuades us that the borrowing statute is applicable to this case, that under that statute this cause of action "arose" in Kentucky, and that the
five-year statute of Kentucky bars this action. See Mister
v. Burkholder, 56 Pa. Super. 517; Fletcher's Estate, 45
Pa. D. & C. 673, 674; Bell v. Brady, 346 Pa. 666, 31 A. 2d
547; Shaffer's Estate, 228 Pa. 36, 40, 76 A. 716, 717.
Cf. Rosenzweig v. Heller, 302 Pa. 279, 153 A. 346. See
also Notes, 88 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 878 (1940), 4 U. of Pitt. L.
Rev. 215 (1938). The judgment of the Circuit Court of
Appeals in No. 593 is therefore reversed.
So ordered.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration
or decision of these cases.
