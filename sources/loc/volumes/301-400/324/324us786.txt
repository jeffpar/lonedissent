RICE v. OLSON, WARDEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA.

No. 391. Argued February 1, 1945.-Decided April 23, 1945.
Petitioner, an Indian under a state court sentence of imprisonment
for one to seven years upon his plea of guilty to a charge of
burglary, petitioned a state court for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he had been deprived of due process of law in that the
trial court failed to advise him of his constitutional rights to counsel
and to call witnesses; that he had not waived those rights by word
or action; and that the conviction was void because the alleged
crime was committed on an Indian Reservation which was within
exclusive federal jurisdiction. Held:
1. The allegations of the petition showed a prima facie violatioD
of petitioner's right to counsel, and he was entitled to a hearing
upon them. Pp. 788, 791.
2. By his plea of guilty, petitioner had not waived his constitutional right to counsel. P. 788.
3. The state court having placed its judgment of dismissal
squarely on the absence of merit in the petition, this Court can not
conclude that the petition failed to satisfy procedural requirements. P. 792.

guilty to a charge of burglary in the District Court of
Thurston County, Nebraska, and was sentenced to from

one to seven years. He petitioned another state District
Court for a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from the
penitentiary on the grounds, among others,' that he had
been deprived of his constitutional right of counsel, and
that the state court lacked jurisdiction. He alleged that
he was ignorant of the law, and that in preparing his petition he had no one to help him except a fellow inmate.
Petitioner did not challenge the facts stated in the judgment entry, i. e., that, in the burglary proceedings, he was
arraigned and pleaded guilty, that the burglary statute was
read to him, and that he then reiterated his plea. He
challenged the validity of the judgment, however, on the
ground that, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,
he had been deprived of due process of law in that the
trial court failed to advise him of his constitutional rights
to counsel and to call witnesses. Petitioner further alleged that he had not waived those rights by word or
action. Finally, the petition alleged that the conviction
was void because the alleged crime was committed on an
Indian Reservation which was exclusively within federal
jurisdiction.
The petition was dismissed by the state District Court,
for lack of merit, without an answer, and without a hearing. Petitioner then moved to set aside the dismissal,
repeating his allegations, and requesting the appointment
of counsel to assist him. The motion was denied, and
petitioner, again acting in his own behalf, appealed to the
Supreme Court of Nebraska. That court, without requiring an answer, affirmed the District Court. 144 Neb.

rights are involved, we granted certiorari and appointed
counsel to represent petitioner. 323 U. S. 696.
In affirming, the Nebraska Supreme Court stated that
"'It is not necessary that there be a formal waiver; and a
waiver will ordinarily be implied where accused appears
without counsel and fails to request that counsel be assigned to him, particularly where accused voluntarily
pleads guilty.'" It is apparent that the court's affirmance did not rest on its statement that a plea of guilty
"ordinarily implied" a waiver of the right to counsel, but
upon a holding that such a plea "absolutely" and finally
waives that right.2 This is inconsistent with our interpretation of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Whatever inference of waiver could be drawn from the
petitioner's plea of guilty is adequately answered by the
uncontroverted statement in his petition that he did not
waive the right either by word or action. This denial of
waiver squarely raised a question of fact. The state
Supreme Court resolved this disputed fact by drawing a
conclusive implication from the petitioner's plea of guilty.
This is the equivalent of a holding that one who voluntarily pleads guilty without the benefit of counsel has
thereby competently waived his constitutional right to
counsel, even though he may have sorely needed and been
unable to obtain legal aid. A defendant who pleads guilty
is entitled to the benefit of counsel, and a request for
counsel is not necessary. It is enough that a defendant
2 In discussing allegations of the petition other than the one relating to appointment of counsel, the state Supreme Court also quoted
with approval a statement that "A plea of guilty admits all facts

sufficiently pleaded, . . . operates as a waiver of any defense, and

.. . with it, of course, the constitutional guarantees with respect
to the conduct of criminal prosecutions." The court therefore said
that since the record affirmatively showed "that the defendant had
pleaded guilty, this absolutely waived this and all other preliminary
steps in connection therewith ..

charged with an offense of this character is incapable
adequately of making his defense, that he is unable to get
counsel, and that he does not intelligently and understandingly waive counsel.' Whether all these conditions exist
is a matter which must be determined by evidence where
the facts are in dispute.
The petitioner's need for legal counsel in this case is
strikingly emphasized by the allegation in his habeas
corpus petition that the offense for which the state court
convicted him was committed on a government Indian
Reservation "without and beyond the jurisdiction of the
Court." This raises an involved question of federal jurisdiction, posing a problem that is obviously beyond the

capacity of even an intelligent and educated layman, and
which clearly demands the counsel of experience and
skill.
The policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in the Nation's history.
See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515; 1 Stat. 469; 4 Stat.
729. In the light of this historical background Congress
in 1885 passed a comprehensive Act, 23 Stat. 362, 385, in
order to fulfill "treaty stipulations with various Indian
Tribes," specifically including the Winnebagoes, of which
tribe the petitioner alleges he is a member. The last section of that Act subjects Indians who commit certain
crimes, including burglary, to trial and punishment. The
language there used to accomplish this purpose is that
"all such Indians committing any of the above crimes
against the person or property of another Indian or other
person within the boundaries of any State of the United
States, and within the limits of any Indian reservation,
shall be subject to the same laws, tried in the same courts
and in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties

as are all other persons committing any of the above crimes
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States."
23 Stat. 385. This section now appears as § 548 in Title
18 of the United States Code, and the state Supreme Court
has ruled that it gives Nebraska authority to try the petitioner. This construction of the section is not in accord
with that heretofore given it by the Courts of Nebraska
and other courts.' In argument before us, Nebraska does
not rely on the state Supreme Court's construction of 18
U. S. C. 548. Instead it argues that petitioner's allegation
that the crime was committed on an Indian Reservation
is false, and that the state Supreme Court was required
to take judicial knowledge of its falsity. It admits, however, that Thurston County, where the burglary was allegedly committed, is included within the original statutory boundaries of a federally created Indian Reservation,
14 Stat. 667, 14 Stat. 671, and that the village of Winnebago, where the alleged offense was committed, is located
within the boundaries of the Winnebago Reservation. The
village of Winnebago, it insists, has ceased to be a part of
the Reservation because all the Indians have been given
the full benefits of citizenship by Nebraska and because
Winnebago is incorporated under the laws of Nebraska and
is located entirely upon land which has been patented in
fee. The facts upon which this contention rests are said
to be those of which Nebraska courts can take judicial
knowledge. With these facts thus established, it is said
that jurisdiction of Nebraska over this offense is conferred
by § 6 of the General Allotment Act passed in 1887, 24
Stat. 390, as amended, 34 Stat. 182. Assuming that all the
facts urged by the State are correct, and that these Indian

lands have been disposed of .under this latter statute, the
State finds support for its contention in this Court's interpretation of that Act in Matter of He0f, 197 U. S. 488.
But later cases have cast considerable doubt on what was,
said in the Heff decision. United States v. Celestine, 215
U. S. 278, 290-291 ; Hallowell v. United States, 221 U. S.
317, 323; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286,
314; Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S. 243, 269-272;
United States v. Chavez, 290 U. S. 357; United States v.
McGowan, 302 U. S. 535, 539.
All of these questions concerning the power of the state
courts to try this Indian petitioner for burglary indicate
the complexities of the problem he would have found had
he attempted to defend himself on this ground. And a
decision by the state court that it had jurisdiction might
or might not have finally determined the issue. Cf. Toy
Toy v. Hopkins, 212 U. S. 542, 549, and Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19.
We conclude that the petitioner is entitled to a hearing
on his allegations that he did not, in the burglary proceedings, waive his constitutional right to have the benefit of
counsel.
It has been suggested that even if the court below erred
in holding that a plea of guilty is a conclusive waiver of
the right to counsel, its judgment might be sustained on
the ground that habeas corpus was not the proper remedy,
or because the allegations of the petition lack sufficient
definiteness. The very fact that the court considered the
petition on its merits gives rise to a strong, if not conclusive, inference that the petition satisfied the state's
procedural requirements in all respects. By treating this
clumsily drawn petition with liberality, instead of dismissing it because of a failure to comply with the precise
niceties of technical procedure, the state Supreme Court
acted in accordance with its traditional solicitude for the

writ.' And this treatment is in line with federal practice.
"A petition for habeas corpus ought not to be scrutinized
with technical nicety. Even if it is insufficient in substance it may be amended in the interest of justice." Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U. S. 342, 350 351.1
Since the state court placed its judgment precisely on
the absence of merit in the petition, we could not, except
by speculation, conclude that the petition failed to measure up to its procedural requirements. 7 For the reasons
given, we hold that the allegations of the petition showed
a prima facie violation of the petitioner's right to

the Attorney General of Nebraska, the meager allegations
of this petition for habeas corpus should preclude our attributing to the Supreme Court of Nebraska a disregard,
in affirming a denial of the petition, of rights under the

THE SECOND CIRCUIT.*
Argued January 10, 1945.-Decided April 23, 1945.
1. The National Labor Relations Board was warranted in these cases
in finding unfair labor practices, violative of § 8 of the National
Labor Relations Act, in the employer's (1) enforcement of a "nosolicitation" rule against the solicitation of union membership by
employees on company property during lunch hour; (2) discharge
of employees for wearing union "shop steward" buttons in the
plant though at a time when a majority of the employees had not
designated any collective bargaining representative; and (3) enforcement of a general "no-distribution" rule against distribution
of union literature or circulars by employees on their own time
though on parking lots owned by the company and adjacent to the
plant. Pp. 795, 803.
2. As an administrative agency with power after hearings to determine on the evidence in adversary proceedings whether violations
of statutory commands have occurred, the Labor Board, within the
limits of its inquiry, may infer from proven facts such conclusions
as reasonably may be based on the facts proven. P. 800.
