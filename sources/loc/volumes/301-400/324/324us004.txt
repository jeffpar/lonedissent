Section 11 (e) of the Bankruptcy Act bars after two years from the

two years from the date of adjudication in bankruptcy
an action brought by the trustee in bankruptcy to set
aside and recover a preferential transfer.
On April 11, 1938, N. L. Rogers & Company, Inc., filed
a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and was duly adjudged
a bankrupt on the same day. On March 3, 1943, the
petitioner trustee filed a complaint under § 60 of the
Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 96, against the respondent
bank to set aside and recover payments totalling over
$300,000 alleged to have been given illegally by the bankrupt to the respondent within four months prior to the
filing of the bankruptcy petition. The District Court
dismissed the complaint on the ground that the suit had
been instituted more than two years subsequent to the
date of adjudication in bankruptcy and hence was barred
by § lie. It thus overruled the trustee's contention that
Illinois law allowed him five years in which to bring this
action and that this five-year limitation was controlling
since it fell within the provision of § lie allowing suits
"within such further time as the federal or state law may
permit." 53 F. Supp. 265. The court below affirmed this
judgment. 141 F. 2d 150. In our view, such a result is
plainly right.
Two-year limitations on suits by and against trustees
have long been integral parts of federal bankruptcy statutes. Section 8 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, 5 Stat.
440, 446, 447, applied a two-year limitation on any "suit
at law or in equity" by or against any assignee of the bankrupt. Courts held that this related only to suits involving
claims held by the bankrupt before assignment, rather
than to suits on claims arising after the bankruptcy proceedings began,' but its applicability as to rights accruing
to the assignee on the date of the assignment by virtue

of the Bankruptcy Act apparently was not raised or
determined.
Section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 517,
518, which was reenacted in substantially the same form
in Revised Statutes § 5057, placed a similar limitation on
any "suit at law or in equity . . . by or against such assignee . . . touching the property and rights of property" of the bankrupt. Here again the limitation was
held to apply only to suits growing out of disputes and
transactions prior to assignment.2 Dushane v. Beall, 161
U. S. 513. But in Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 346, this
Court stated that this limitation "applies to all judicial
contests between the assignee and other persons touching
the property or rights of property of the bankrupt transferable to or vested in the assignee." See also Gifford v.
Helms, 98 U. S. 248, 252; Jenkins v. InternationalBank,
106 U. S. 571, 575. The inference seems clear from this
that suits to set aside preferential transfers made prior to
the assignment would have been held to fall within the
reach of the two-year limitation.
Section lid of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat.
544, 549, provided that "Suits shall not be brought by or
against a trustee of a bankrupt estate subsequent to two
years after the estate has been closed." State and lower
federal courts explicitly and uniformly held that this twoyear limitation controlled the trustee's right to set aside
and recover preferential transfers under § 60 of the Act.'
But courts differed as to whether § lid or state statutes of
limitation applied to causes of action inherited by the
4
trustee from the bankrupt or the bankrupt's creditors.

Opinion of the Court.

It was this conflict under § lid of the 1898 Act that was
primarily responsible for the framing of the new § lie in
1938. This latter provision, which is controlling in this
case, settles the problem by stating in part that "A receiver or trustee may, within two years subsequent to the
date of adjudication or within such further period of time
as the federal or state law may permit, institute proceedings in behalf of the estate upon any claim against which
the period of limitation fixed by federal or state law had
not expired at the time of the filing of the petition in
bankruptcy."
In light of the judicial construction and application of
analogous provisions in earlier bankruptcy acts, it is
significant that Congress in § lie failed to enlarge the
time for bringing suits arising under the Bankruptcy Act
by making state statutes of limitation of longer duration
applicable to such federal causes of action. None of the
prior provisions had been construed so as to apply state
statutes of limitations to actions by trustees based on
claims arising under the bankruptcy statutes. And the
courts had frankly and unmistakably imposed the twoyear limitation of §lld of the 1898 Act, which is the immediate predecessor of § lle, to suits by trustees to set
aside and recover preferential transfers. The legislative
background and history, as well as the language of § lie,
are barren of any basis for concluding that Congress intended to make suits of this nature subject to longer
limitations imposed by state laws.5 Congress could have
Callaghan v. Bailey, 293 N. Y. 396, 57 N. E. 2d 729. Cases holding that

the state statutes of limitation applied include Davis v. Willey, 273
F. 397, and Silverman v. Christian,123 N. J. Eq. 506, 198 A. 832. See
also Charlesworth v. Hipsh, Inc., 84 F. 2d 834; Nairn v. McCarthy,
120 F. 2d 910.
5H. Rep. No. 1409 (75th Cong., 1st Sess.) p. 20, stated that "A new
provision in subdivision e permits receivers and trustees within 2 years
after the adjudication to institute suits on claims against which the
period of limitation fixed by federal or state law had not expired at

expressly restricted the field within which the two-year
limitation was to be operative had it so wished. Its failure
to do so cannot be ignored.
The actual language used in § lie is clearly appropriate
to an action under § 60. Section 11e is not limited by its
words to actions inherited by the trustee; nor does it discriminate against actions by the trustee accruing to him
under the Act. It provides simply that the trustee must
bring action on any claim in behalf of the estate within two
years subsequent to the date of adjudication or within such
further time as the federal or state law permits, provided
that such law did not bar the action on the date when the
petition was filed.
Here the only applicable law is §60 of the Bankruptcy
Act, which generates the cause of action and which contains no time limitations as to actions brought pursuant
thereto. And since the trustee's right to set aside and recover preferential transfers relates to transactions occurring prior to the filing of the petition and since this
right did not accrue before the date on which the petition
was filed, such an action obviously cannot be excluded
from the limitation on the ground that it was barred by
federal or state law at the time the petition was filed.
Hence the trustee was bound to "institute proceedings in
the time of the bankruptcy or within such further time as the federal
or state law may permit."
S. Rep. No. 1916"(75th Cong., 3d Sess.) p. 13, stated: "The provisions of the existing law in regard to suits by or against trustees have
been revised and modified, and receivers are included. The period of
limitations in respect to such suits has been restricted in the bill to
2 years after the date of adjudication instead of 2 years after the
date of the closing of the estate."

behalf of the estate" to set aside and recover any preferential transfers "within two years subsequent to the date
of adjudication." More than two years having elapsed between the date of adjudication and the commencement of
the suit in this instance, the courts below properly held
that the action was barred under § lie.
Inasmuch as the federal Bankruptcy Act has created the
liability and has also fixed the limitation of time for commencing actions to enforce it, we have no occasion to consider the trustee's arguments concerning the applicability
and construction of the Illinois statutes of limitation.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 86.

Argued December 8, 1944.-Decided January 29, 1945.

1. A cease and desist order of the National Labor Relations Board
and an order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for its enforcement
may validly provide that the order shall apply to the employer's "successors and assigns." P. 16.
2. An order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the enforcement
of a cease and desist order of the Board, though applying in terms
to "successors and assigns," would have a scope no broader than
that prescribed by -Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for
the District Courts-"Every order granting an injunction and
every restraining order . . . is binding only upon the parties to
the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal
service or otherwise." P. 14.
