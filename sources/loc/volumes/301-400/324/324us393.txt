Syllabus.

loughby Bay, the government was likewise authorized to
deposit in Mason Creek for the same purpose. There is
power to block navigation at one place to foster it at another.'2 Whether this blocking be done by altering the
stream's course, by lighthouses, jetties, piers, or a dam
made of dredged material, the government's power is the
same and in the instant case is derived from the same
source-its authority to regulate commerce. Since the
judgment awarded rested entirely upon the conclusion
that respondent's property had been taken by "filling and
closing Mason Creek," and since all of respondent's "riparian rights" were subordinate to the government's power
to close the stream, the judgment is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the

opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 143 F. 2d 721.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 534. Argued February 2, 1945.-Decided March 26, 1945.
1. Whether at the date of the death of a taxpayer a dividend has
"accrued," within the meaning of § 42 of the Revenue Act of 1938,
so as to be includible in computing income of the taxpayer, is a

CERTIORARI, 323 U. S. 702, to review the reversal of two
orders of the Board of Tax Appeals (45 B. T. A. 517) involving the income tax liability of a taxpayer and of his
estate.

T. Swaine, Roswell Magill and George G. Tyler were on

the brief, for petitioner.
Miss Helen R. Carloss, with whom Solicitor General

Messrs. Sewall Key, Robert N. Anderson, Walter J. Cummings, Jr. and Miss Helen Goodner were on the brief, for

respondent.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case brings here for review a judgment which applies Section 42, Revenue Act of 1938,1 so as to "accrue"
corporate dividends on the date of their declaration rather
than the later record or payment dates. The result is that

the dividends are taxable as income to a decedent taxpayer
instead of to his estate.
Certiorari was granted

52 Stat. 447, 473, § 42:
"The amount of all items of gross income shall be included in the
gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer,
unless, under methods of accounting permitted under section 41,
any such amounts are to be properly accounted for as of a different
period. In the case of the death of a taxpayer there shall be included
in computing net income for the taxable period in which falls the
date of his death, amounts accrued up to the date of his death if not
otherwise properly includible in respect of such period or a prior
period."

sion between Tar Products Corp. v. Commissioner, 130 F.
2d 866, and this case as to the date of accrual of corporate
dividends. The resolution of this conflict is complicated
by further conflicts between the decision below and those
in other circuits as to whether the governing rule is to be
drawn from federal or state law. Helvering v. McGlue's
Estate, 119 F. 2d 167, 171; Commissionerv. Cohen, 121 F.
2d 348, 349.
The decedent, Henry W. Putnam, died on March 30,
1938. Prior to his death several corporations in which he
owned stock declared dividends which by the resolutions
were payable and were paid to stockholders of record on
dates which were subsequent to his death. Each of these
dividends, aggregating in all $24,051.75, was held by the
Commissioner to constitute income to the decedent under
the provisions of § 42. The Board of Tax Appeals decided
that the time of accrual depends upon the varying state
decisions as to when a corporate debt arises upon a declaration of dividend with a provision for its payment to
stockholders of record on some future date. 45 B. T. A.
517. This resulted in an agreement in part with the
Commissioner's determination.
The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the view that federal law controlled the disposition of the controversy and
that the dividend accrued on its declaration. Commissioner v. Guaranty Trust Co., 144 F. 2d 756.
We think the federal law controls. A federal revenue
act applicable throughout the nation fixes liability on the
decedent taxpayer under § 42 if the dividend is "accrued."
The meaning of that word in this section should be uniform unless Congress has shown an intention to permit its
meaning to be varied by state law. Burnet v. Harmel, 287
U. S. 103, 110; Palmer v. Bender, 287 U. S. 551, 555;
United States v. Pelzer, 312 U. S. 399, 402-3. Section 42
lays down the test of accrual for the taxation of a decedent's income and the definition of the meaning and extent

of that test is a federal responsibility. The present problem is closely akin to that resolved in Lyeth v. Hoey, 305
U. S. 188, 193. In that case an heir received a sum in
settlement of litigation over a will. Its taxability as income under the federal statute depended upon the meaning of the statutory exemption "acquired by inheritance."
The law of the testator's domicile held sums paid as will
compromises were not inheritances. Acting on the principle that, in the interest of uniformity, exemptions under
federal statutes should be determined by federal courts,
we reached a contrary federal rule. The same principle
leads to our conclusion in this case.We recently examined the Congressional purpose in
the enactment of § 42. Helvering v. Enright, 312 U. S.
636. That purpose was to cover into income the "accruals" theretofore unreported as income of a decedent
8 The Government calls attention to the conflict in state decisions as
to the event which vests title according to state law to a corporate
dividend. Some specify the declaration and some compliance with
the requirement of being a stockholder of record on a subsequent date.

142 N. E. 67.
Accrual under § 42, however, is not dependent upon these varying
concepts of when dividends vest. Despite possible difference between
state and federal income taxation of dividend items, the presumed
Congressional purpose to have the national revenue acts uniformly
administered leads to a federal interpretation of accruals under § 42.
Such inconsistency would not occur if the federal accrual date under
§ 42 is held eventually to be the same for taxpayers on the accrued and
cash basis. Cf. Avery v. Commissioner, 292 U. S. 210; Tar Products
Corp. v. Commissioner,130 F. 2d 866.

taxpayer who reported on a cash basis. By "accrual" the
income so accrued became subject to income tax as decedent's income. These "accruals" had theretofore escaped
taxation as the income of decedent, because no cash was
received during decedent's life. Moreover, such payments
were held not to be the income of decedent's estate on the
theory that the "accrual" was a part of the corpus of the
estate at death and therefore the estate's subsequent
receipt of the "accruals" as cash was not income to the
estate. Helvering v. Enright, supra, p. 639. In the instant case there is no avoidance of income taxes such as
§ 42 was designed to prevent. If the dividend does not
"accrue" to decedent on the date of declaration so as to
be taxable as income to him, it will appear as an item of
income in the income tax return of the estate or of the
stockholder who owns the stock on the record date.4 Tax4Respondent argues for the judgment below on the ground that
the dividends could not properly be treated as income of the estate
when received, since the receipt of the dividends in cash by the estate
was merely a conversion into money of one of the assets of the estate,
citing Vanderbilt v. Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 291; Nichols v. United
States, 64 Ct. Cls. 241; 80 Treas. Reg., Art. 13. The truth or error
of this position depends upon whether those dividends are income,
by virtue of the accrual provision of § 42, to the decedent. If they
are income to the decedent, they cannot be income also to the estate.
If they are not income to the decedent, they are income to the estate.
The Vanderbilt and Nichols cases were apparently decided on the
theory that the items in controversy constituted income to the
decedent and assets of the estate for estate tax purposes and therefore could not later be income to the estate. The regulation does not
purport to direct the :return as corpus of the estate of dividends declared but with a record date subsequent to the stockholder's death.
Neither do the present regulations. 105 Treas. Reg., § 81.13; of.
United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 171.
Congress'has modified § 42 by an amendment which is inapplicable
to this case. -Revenue Act of 1942, § 134, 56 Stat. 798, 830; H. Rep.

wise, it may be important upon whom the tax falls as the
sum assessed may vary according to the tax bracket of
the taxpayer. This result, however, is apart from the
purpose of Congress in enacting § 42 and is not significant
in the interpretation of the section.'
We assume that decedent was a taxpayer on the cash
receipts basis. Compare 144 F. 2d 756, 757.1 Our inquiry leads us only to a decision as to whether a dividend
accrues as income on its declaration with a subsequent
record date, not to whether it accrues on its record date
or its payment date. A declaration of a dividend to stockholders of record on the date of the resolution but payable
in the future is not involved. This Court has suggested
5 A reference to dividends appears in the legislative history but casts
no light on the problem of the event which accrues a corporate dividend. See H. R. 7835, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., printed with Senate
amendments, March 28 (Calendar day, April 13), 1934; I. R. B., C. B.
1939-1 (Part 2), p. 629, Amendment 27; § 43, Revenue Act of 1934,
48 Stat. 694; § 43, Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 473.
6 Therefore the construction of accrued according to the taxpayer's
method of accounting, which is directed in § 48 (c), 52 Stat. 476, is
not of use. Helvering v. Enright, 312 U. S. 636, 644. Avery v. Commissioner, 292 U. S. 210, holds that dividends of a living taxpayer on
the cash basis would not become his income on mere declaration but
only when "received," that is, unqualifiedly made subject to the stockholder's demand as by check. "Received" in the section there under
consideration was the word designating taxability as income of sums
actually or constructively collected, including dividends, as it is in
the section of the statute here involved. This rule has been continuously
applied.
See Mason v. Routzahn, 275 U. S. 175, 178; 65 Treas. Reg., Art.
1541; 101 Treas. Reg., Art.. 42-3; 111 Treas. Reg., § 29.42-3; 53
Harv. L. Rev. 853; 2 Mertens, Federal Income Taxation, 17.
See Tar Products Corp. v. Commissioner, 130 F. 2d 866, for an instance of the application of this rule to a taxpayer on the accrual basis.
Compare 94 Treas. Reg., Art. 115-1 and 22 (a) (1) for appraisal of
position of those regulations as to date when dividends are received
by a taxpayer. American Light & Traction Co. v. Commissioner,

Opinion of the Court.

that a tax be deemed to accrue as a charge against a taxpayer when events "occur which fix the amount of the tax
and determine the liability of the taxpayer to pay it."
United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S.422, 441. It has said
also that accrual imports "that it is the right to receive and
not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of the
amount in gross income." Spring City Co. v. Commissioner, 292 U. S. 182, 184. The declaration of the dividends here in question fixes their amount but does not
determine the distributee. He cannot be known with certainty until the record date. Nor does the stockholder
have the right to receive payment upon the declaration.
The words of the corporate resolution which arranges for
the payment from the stock record of a certain day determine the earliest time for possible receipt.
Under the income tax acts no stockholder has a separate
and divisible taxable interest in the assets of a corporation
even though those assets have been increased by earnings.
Earnings, before declaration of dividends, while increasing
the value of his stock, have never been treated as an event
to mark taxable income to the stockholder. Mere declaration of a dividend does not alter the stockholder's interest
in the corporate assets. If no other factors were involved
in value except earnings and dividends, the value of the
stock would advance pari passu with earnings and the
declaration of a dividend with a subsequent record date
for payment would not affect the stock's value. United
States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156, 171. See Schabacker,
Stock Market, 353. The stockholder can acquire no interest in a dividend, amounting to an accrual under § 42,
before the amount of the dividend and the distributee is
determined.
In applying to the present dividends our description of
accruals under § 42 as "assets of decedents, earned during
their life and unreported as income, which on a cash re-

turn, would appear in the estate returns,"" the Court of
Appeals may have treated the words "earned during" the
decedent's life as though they included, prior to a declaration of dividends, the proportionate part of corporate
earnings attributable to decedent's stock. If so, it is a
more extended meaning than was intended, since stock
does not earn an identifiable separate taxable share of
corporate profits for its owner before the corporation
makes those profits available to the stockholder. It is
not the earnings of a corporation but the separation of
those earnings by a completed dividend which assigns a
part of those earnings to a stockholder. The price a stockholder would receive on a stock sale after declaration and
before the record date would reflect corporate earnings
but would not reflect the declaration or non-declaration
of a dividend. As the same value would be in the stock
with or without the declaration, the price would be the
same. Only an ex-dividend sale would affect price.
For the earnings of a corporation to pass into the earnings of its stockholder, so as to be subject to accrual to
the stockholder under § 42, something more than a
declaration of dividends with a subsequent record date to
identify the distributee is required. Such a declaration
leaves the identity of the recipient at large. Such uncertainty destroys any conception of accrued as involving a
right to receive or an obligation to pay; elements which
we think are essential for accruals under our decisions.8

on this question in Estate of McGlue, 41 B. T. A. 1186, 1193. After
