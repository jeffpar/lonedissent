this case and could not use it as a vehicle for assuming

unjustified jurisdiction over the facilities of all the local
distributing companies in the nation. It has given proper
respect to the dictates of Congress relative to state regulation. We should therefore affirm its action in this case
without burdening it with requirements of artistic refinement and of negations of the applicability of irrelevant
statutory provisions.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 354. Argued February 2, 1945.-Decided March 26, 1945.
Article 115-3 of Treasury Regulations 101, promulgated under the
Revenue Act of 1938, requires that, for computing under § 112 (b)
(7) (E) the amount of "earnings and profits" distributed by a corporation as liquidating dividends, with respect to securities which
the corporation had acquired by tax-free exchanges for its own stock
and had later sold, the basis be the transferor's cost rather than the
value of the securities at the time of their acquisition by the corporation. Held:
1. The regulation was reasonable and a valid exercise of the rulemaking power. P. 546.
2. Though the Tax Court relied on § 501 of the Second Revenue
Act of 1940, it is unnecessary here to determine the constitutionality
of applying that section retroactively. P. 547.
143 F. 2d 162, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 323 U. S. 694, to review the reversal of a
decision of the Tax Court, 1 T. C. 640, which sustained the
Commissioner's determination of deficiencies in income

tax.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Bernard Chertcoff, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0. Clark, Jr.,
Messrs. Sewall Key, J. Louis Monarchand Walter J. Cummings, Jr. were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Win. Dwight Whitney, with whom Messrs. Roswell
Magill and George G. Tyler were on the brief, for the
respondents.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has
held Section 501 (a) of the Second Revenue Act of 1940 to
be unconstitutional.1 This of course called for grant of
2
certiorari.
Since our problem is not computation of a tax, the facts
relevant to the issues in the five cases, consolidated on
appeal, may be shortly stated. In 1925, John H. Wheeler
and his wife, Frances, organized under the laws of California the John H. Wheeler Company. Then and thereafter they transferred an assortment of securities to it in
exchange for shares of its common stock. The securities
had cost them $304,684.49 and at transfer had a fair market value of $491,800. In exchange the Wheelers received
4,918 shares with a par value of $100 each. No gain by
them was recognized for income-tax purposes by reason
of the exchange. Cf. Int. Rev. Code § 112 (b) (5).
For purposes of determining its income-tax liability on
subsequent disposition of the securities, the corporation
was obliged to and did use as a cost base the cost of the
securities to the transferors, $304,684.49. Cf. Int. Rev.
Code § 113 (a) (8). But for its corporate accounting the
corporation set up a cost of $491,800, market value at the

time of acquisition in exchange for common stock of equal
par value. The whole question in this case is which of
these bases is to be used to compute, pursuant to § 112 (b)
(7) (E) of the Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 447, 488, the
amount of "earnings and profits" distributed as liquidating dividends. The Act of 1938, to induce corporate
liquidations, permitted a qualified stockholder to elect
postponement of a portion of the gain realized on a December 1938 liquidation and to be taxed, as for a dividend, on
"so much of the gain as is not in excess of his ratable share
of the earnings and profits of the corporation . . ." If
the market-value basis is used for the securities acquired
from the Wheelers and later sold, the operations of the
Company showed a deficit on November 30, 1938, when
the books were closed. If the cost-to-transferors basis is
used, "earnings and profits" were distributed to respondents, the stockholders, in the amount of $132,813.48, as
computed by the Commissioner.'
After considering the applicability of § 112 (b) (7), the
stockholders duly dissolved the corporation and distributed its assets during December 1938. They elected to be
taxed on the gains on their shares pursuant to § 112 (b)
(7), and they reported, of course, according to the higher
or market-value basis for the securities acquired and disposed of by the Company. The Commissioner asserted
a deficiency based on the lower cost to the transferors.
In explaining his determination he relied on § 501 (a) of
the Second Revenue Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 974, 1004, which
provides that earnings and profits on the sale or other disposition of property shall be determined by using the
adjusted basis for determining gains and by recognizing
such gains to the extent that they are recognized for computing net income, and on § 501 (c), which makes the
provisions of § 501 (a) applicable to prior years.

This was slightly modified by the Tax Court in an aspect not
material here.

COMMISSIONER v. WHEELER.
542

Opinion of the Court.

The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner.4 It held
§ 501 (a) of the Act of 1940 a "complete answer" to taxpayers' contention, and it overruled their claim that if the
section was applicable to increase their 1938 liability it
was retroactive in contravention of the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution. The Circuit Court of Appeals agreed
that the section was applicable, but held that such retroactivity rendered it unconstitutional.
Although the term "earnings and profits" has long
been in the revenue acts, in connection with the definition
of dividends, it has never been defined by the statutesI
(except in so far as § 501 (a) of the Second Act of 1940
has now done so). But under the Revenue Act of 1934
and succeeding acts, the Commissioner dealt by regulation with that portion of the problem of definition relevant here. Article 115-3 of Treasury Regulations 101, promulgated under the 1938 Act, provided in part as follows:
"Gains and losses within the purview of section 112 or
corresponding provisions of prior Acts are brought into
the earnings and profits at the time and to the extent such
gains and losses are recognized under that section." 6 This
regulation, if valid, disposes of the controversy, for when
the corporation sold its securities acquired from the
Wheelers it realized gain, based on transferor's cost, which
was fully recognized under § 112.
The only reason to doubt the validity of the regulation
is found in certain decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals
and lower courts, mentioned in the Tax Court's opinion.
Despite these adverse decisions, however, the Commis' 1 T. C. 640.

sioner persisted in applying the regulation. The question
was never reviewed here. Before it was finally judicially
considered, Congress enacted § 501 of the Second Revenue
Act of 1940, as the committee reports show,' to "clarify
the law" by enacting the substance of the regulation. But
if the regulation itself was valid and effective, the clarifying amendment of 1940 added nothing to the liability of
these taxpayers, and even though the Tax Court relied
on it rather than on the regulation, no question of retroactivity is presented.
We think the regulation is reasonable and a valid exercise of the rule-making power. The taxpayers are insisting
on using as a base for tax purposes a figure that in itself
had no relation to taxation. It was no doubt permissible and perhaps the correct accounting, for determining
earned surplus for dividends and such corporate purposes,
for the corporation to set up its books on the market value
of its property at the time of acquisition, which determined the value of the stock it issued. But "earnings and
profits" in the tax sense, although it does not correspond
exactly to taxable income, does not necessarily follow corporate accounting concepts either.' Congress has determined that in certain types of transaction the economic
changes are not definitive enough to be given tax consequences, and has clearly provided that gains and losses on
such transactions shall not be recognized for income-tax
liability but shall be taken account of later. §§ 112, 113.
It is sensible to carry through the theory in determining
the tax effect of such transactions on earnings and profits.

Sen. Rep. No. 2156, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 19; H. R.

itself (§ 111 (c) of the 1938 Act), which declares: "In the
case of a sale or exchange, the extent to which the gain or
loss determined under this section shall be recognized for
the purposes of this title, shall be determined under the
provisions of section 112." 1 In this case, to be sure, there
was no question of recognition of gain or loss to the corporation at the time of the exchange with the Wheelers, because it was issuing its own stock and so realized no gain
or loss. But to recognize the increment in value as affecting earnings and profits would no more harmonize with
the taxless character of the transaction than to treat a
realized gain as doing so. The same policy which carries
over the transferor's basis for purposes of the corporation's
income tax (§ 113 (a) (8)) requires carrying it over for
determining the taxability of its distributions, as the Commissioner's regulation directs: gains and losses are to be
brought into earnings and profits at the time and "to the
extent" that they are recognized under § 112. Finally, no
doubt of the reasonableness of the rule can linger in the
presence of § 501 (a), by which Congress has indicated
its express approval of the principle that the basis for
determining earnings and profits shall be the basis for
determining gain.
We therefore think that on principles often reiterated 'o
the regulation is valid and decisive of this issue. There is
no necessity to predicate the determination of deficiency
on the 1940 amendment. The 1940 amendment conse1 (Italics supplied.) See Paul, Selected Studies in Federal Taxation

MARKET STREET RAILWAY CO. v. RAILROAD
COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA ET AL.
APPEALS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

Nos. 510 and 511. Argued February 26, 1945.-Decided March 26,
1945.
1. For the purpose of appeal to this Court, the judgment of the
Supreme Court of California here involved became final upon that
court's denial of a petition for rehearing; and an appeal was not premature though taken before expiration of the 30-day period in which,
under the state law and practice, the state court could have modified
the judgment. P. 551.
2. An order of the state commission requiring the appellant street railway company to reduce its base cash fare from seven to six cents,
held, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution,
not a deprivation of property without due process of law. Pp.
553, 569.
(a) There is no foundation in the record for the company's contention that in the proceedings before the Commission it was given
no adequate notice that its rates were under attack and therefore
no opportunity for a hearing on the reasonableness of its rates.
P. 558.
'(b) The order was not unsupported by evidence and was not
rendered invalid by the fact that the Commission evaluated the company's experience for itself without the aid of expert testimony.
P. 559.
(c) The order was not invalid as based on matters outside the
record. The Commission's incidental reference to the company's
