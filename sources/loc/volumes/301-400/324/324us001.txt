OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
In 1936 Choate and Hogan, a partnership of which the
petitioner was a member, acquired an oil and. gas lease.
They drilled six producing wells on the leased land and
operated the property until August 1938. At that time
they sold to Sylva Oil Co. for a cash consideration of $110,000 all their right, title and interest in the lease "together
with all wells and the equipment thereof, including pumps,
casing, piping, tanks, lease house, and all other personal
property on or used in connection" with the premises.
But they expressly reserved to themselves "1/8 of the
8/8ths of all oil and gas and casinghead gas which may be
produced and saved" from the land. Thereafter Sylva
Oil Co. drilled additional wells and operated the lease.
Choate and Hogan in their partnership return for 1938
reported the transaction as a sale. Respondent in his deficiency notice ruled that the transaction constituted a
sublease. The Tax Court took the same view, holding
that the partners must look to depletion for the return of
their capital. It held that the principle of recovery by
depletion was applicable where a royalty interest was retained and that a cash bonus was to be regarded as in the
nature of an advance royalty. It held, however, that there.
had been an absolute sale of the equipment, that its cost
was not recoverable by depletion, and that the partners
were entitled to an allowance for the unrecovered cost of
the equipment transferred. The Commissioner challenged
the latter ruling-in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit as respects Choate, in the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as respects Hogan. The
Commissioner won in the Tenth Circuit (141 F. 2d 641)
and lost in the Fifth. Hogan v. Commissioner, 141 F. 2d
92. It was to resolve that conflict that we granted
the petition in the present case limited to that single
question.

CHOATE v. COMMISSIONER.
1

Opinion of the Court.

The Commissioner makes an elaborate argument based
on the assumption that there was no sale of the equipment. The assumption is that after the partnership transferred its interest in the lease its investment was no longer
in the leasehold and equipment as such but was an economic interest in an oil producing enterprise-an interest
which is depletable since it is measured by the production
of oil. But there are two difficulties with that argument.
In the first place, we find nothing in the Revenue Act of
1938, 52 Stat. 447, or in the Treasury Regulations which
provides for depletion of equipment used in the operation
of oil and gas wells. A deduction is allowed for depreciation by § 23 (1) which permits a "reasonable allowance for
the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the
trade or business." And see Treasury Regulations 101,
Art. 23 (m)-18. Sec. 23 (in) provides that in the case
of "mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and
timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case" may be taken as a deduction. And
see Treasury Regulations 101, Art. 23 (m)-10. Depletion
is applicable to wasting assets-to the exhaustion of natural resources, not of property used in a business. See
4 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (1942)
§ 24.02. That distinction between depletion and depreciation runs through the basis provisions of the Act. See
§ 111 (a), § 113 (a) and (b), § 114 (a) and (b). And the
history of the depletion provisions indeed makes clear that
only intangible drilling and development costs, not costs
represented by physical property, are returnable by way
of depletion. See United States v. Dakota-MontanaOil
Co., 288 U. S. 459; 4 Mertens, op. cit., § 24.48; Treasury
Regulations 101, Art. 23 (m)-16 (a). In the second place,
the Tax Court found that the parties intended a cash sale
of the equipment. That question is argued here as if it
were open for redetermination by us. It is not. It is the

kind of issue reserved for the Tax Court under Dobson v.
Commissioner, 320 U. S. 489, and Wilmington Trust Co.
v. Helvering, 316 U. S. 164, 167-168. Once a sale of the
equipment is conceded, it is not denied that petitioner is
entitled to an allowance for the unrecovered cost of the
equipment transferred. § 111 (a), § 113 (a) and (b).
No question is presented concerning the allocation of a
portion of the purchase price to the equipment.
Reversed.
