delivery to respondent of an option of no present value, but
included the compensation obtainable by the exercise of
the option given for that purpose. It of course does not
follow that in other circumstances not here present the
option itself, rather than the proceeds of its exercise, could
not be found to be the only intended compensation.
The Tax Court thus found that the option was given to
respondent as compensation for services, and implicitly
that the compensation referred to was the excess in value
of the shares of stock over the option price whenever the
option was exercised. From these facts it concluded that
the compensation was taxable as such by the provisions
of the applicable Revenue Acts and regulations. We find
no basis for disturbing its findings, and we conclude it correctly applied the law to the facts found. Its decision is
affirmed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals below,
reversing it, is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS is of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, 142 F. 2d 818.

CHARLESTON FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION ET AL. V. ALDERSON, STATE TAX
COMMISSIONER.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST
VIRGINIA.

No. 400. Argued February 7, 1945.-Decided February 26, 1945.
1. The validity of a state statute under the Federal Constitution does
not appear to have been drawn in question in this suit in the state
courts challenging tax assessments, and an appeal under § 237 (a)
of the Judicial Code as amended is unauthorized; but under § 237 (c)
certiorari is granted, since appellants properly raised the question
of the validity of the assessments under the equal protection clause
of the Federal Constitution. Pp. 184, 187.

Opinion of the Court.

2. Even where the federal question has been properly raised and decided in the state courts, an appeal under § 237 (a) may be dismissed
where appellants fail to attack a statute explicitly in their assignments of error here. P. 187.
3. Since the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
does not operate to bar taxation which does not in fact bear unequally on persons or property of the same class, mere differences in
modes of assessment not shown to produce such inequality are not
forbidden. P. 190.
4. Nor does the equal protection clause prohibit inequality in taxation
which results from mere mistake or error in judgment of tax officials,
or which is not shown to be the result of intentional or systematic
undervaluation of some but not all of the taxed property in a single
class. P. 190.
5. The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of assessments
for taxation is upon the protestant. P. 191.
6. Appellant loan associations failed to sustain the burden of showing
that state tax officials, who assessed appellants' property for state
taxation at its full value, denied to appellants the equal protection
of the laws, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, by their
mode of valuation, for taxation, of property of the same class
belonging to other taxpayers. P. 192.

APPEAL from

Mr. J. Campbell Palmer,III, with whom Mr. W. Elliott
Nefflen was on the brief, for appellants.
Mr. Kenneth E. Hines, Assistant Attorney General of
West Virginia, with whom Mr. Ira J. Partlow, Attorney
General, was on the brief, for appellee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The question is whether the tax officials of West Vir-

ginia, who have assessed appellants' property for state
taxation at its full value, have denied to appellants the
equal protection of the laws, guaranteed by the Four-

teenth Amendment, by their mode of valuation, for taxation, of property of the same class belonging to other
taxpayers.
Appellants are three Federal Savings and Loan Associations, organized under federal laws, and one Building
and Loan Association, organized under state laws. They
filed petitions with the county court of Kanawha County,
West Virginia, seeking a review and reduction of the 1941
assessment of their property for taxation by the county
assessor. They alleged that their property was assessed
at a proportionately higher assessment valuation than
the property of other taxpayers and that such assessment
was unequal and discriminatory, in contravention of the
state constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the
federal Constitution.
The county court, sitting as a Board of Review, reduced
the assessments after a hearing. On appeal the Circuit
Court for Kanawha County reversed the determination
of the county court, and reestablished the assessments.
The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, the highest court of the state, affirmed, 126 W. Va. 506, 30 S. E.
2d 513, holding that appellants had failed to make such
a clear showing of the unequal effect of the tax as to justify
their complaint.
The case comes here on appeal from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, purporting
to have been taken under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code
as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 344 (a), which authorizes an
appeal from the "final judgment or decree in any suit in
the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit
could be had, . . . where is drawn in question the validity
of a statute of any State, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, . . . and the decision is in
favor of its validity." In their protests against the assessments, filed with the county court, appellants did not
draw in question the validity of any statute. They alleged

Opinion of the Court.

only that the assessments were not uniform and equal with
the assessments of other property owners and that they
violated the Fourteenth Amendment. And in their petition for appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West
Virginia appellants contended only that the assessments
denied to them equal protection of the laws in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is essential to our jurisdiction on appeal under § 237
(a) that there be an explicit and timely insistence in the
state courts that a state statute, as applied, is repugnant
to the federal Constitution, treaties or laws. Loeber v.
Schroeder, 149 U. S. 580, 585; Erie R. Co. v. Purdy, 185
U. S. 148, 153-4; Fullerton v. Texas, 196 U. S. 192, 193;

Mississippi, 323 U. S. 668; Carter v. General American
Life Ins. Co., 323 U. S. 676; Putzier v. Richardson, 323
U. S. 677. And it has long been settled that an attack
upon a tax assessment or levy, such as appellants here
made, on the ground that it infringes a taxpayer's federal
rights, privileges, or immunities, will not sustain an appeal
under § 237 (a). Jett Bros. Co. v. City of Carrollton,252

U. S. 267, 272; cf. Reeves v. Williamson, 317 U. S. 593.
Where it appears from the opinion of the state court of
last resort that a state statute was drawn in question, as
repugnant to the Constitution, and that the decision of the
court was in favor of its validity, we have jurisdiction
on appeal. For we need not inquire how and when the

question of the validity of the statute was raised when
such question appears to have been actually considered
and decided by that court. Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v.
Cohen, 234 U. S. 123, 134; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v.
Perry, 259 U. S. 548, 551; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276
U. S. 260, 267; Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, 407;
Nickey v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 393, 394; Whitfield v.
Ohio, 297 U. S. 431, 435-6. But it does not appear from
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Appeals that the federal question was presented to or considered by that court.
While the opinion intimates that appellants' objection was
made to the administration of the statute, it nowhere indicates that they contended that, as applied, the statute
was invalid as repugnant to the federal Constitution.'
' The President of the Supreme Court of Appeals, in allowing the
appeal to this Court, wrote a memorandum opinion to the effect that
the question of the validity of the statute under the Constitution was
raised and decided there. Appellants urge that this indicates that
the appeal is proper. While a certificate of the state court, made
part of the record, to the effect that the federal question in issue
was decided there is generally sufficient to sustain our jurisdiction,
when it is consistent with the record, Capital City Dairy v. Ohio, 183
U. S. 238, 244; Marvin v. Trout, 199 U. S. 212, 222-4; Cincinnati
Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U. S. 179, 182; Consolidated Turnpike v.
Norfolk & 0. V. R. Co., 228 U. S. 596, 599; Whitney v. California,
274 U. S. 357, 360-2; Honeyman v. Hanan, 300 U. S. 14, 22, a certificate to the same effect by the presiding justice of the state appellate
court does not suffice, although it may serve to interpret indefinite
or ambiguous evidence in the record, relied upon to show that the
federal question was raised. Felix v. Scharnweber, 125 U. S. 54, 59,
60; Henkel v. Cincinnati,177 U. S. 170; Gulf & Ship Island R. Co. v.

545; Honeyman v. Hanan, supra, 18, and cases cited; Lisenba v.
California, 314 U. S. 219. The memorandum of the President
of the West Virginia court was not oufficient of itself to establish that

CHARLESTON ASSN. v. ALDERSON.
182

Opinion of the Court.

Appellants in their assignment of errors in this Court
have failed to attack the state statute as repugnant to
the Constitution, stating only that the finding and judgment below sustaining the assessment violate the equal
protection clause. Even where the federal question has
been properly raised below, an appeal under § 237 (a)
may be dismissed where appellants fail to attack a statute
explicitly in their assignments of error here. Cady v.
Georgia, 323 U. S. 676; cf. Herbringv. Lee, 280 U. S. 111,
117; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Watson, 287 U. S. 86,
91; Flournoy v. Wiener, 321 U. S. 253.
For these reasons we grant appellee's motion to dismiss
the appeal. Treating the papers on which the appeal was
allowed as a petition for writ of certiorari, as required by
§ 237 (c) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U. S. C.
§ 344 (c), certiorari is granted, since appellants have
properly attacked the validity of the assessments under
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and we proceed to consider the merits.
Section 14 (a) of Chapter 11, Article III of the West
Virginia Code of 1941, provides that "the capital of every
building and loan association and federal savings and loan
association, as represented or evidenced by the investment shares and investment accounts in such association,
shall be assessed at its true and actual value. . . The
real and actual value of such capital, represented by the
market value of such investment shares and investment
accounts as aforesaid, shall be ascertained according to
the best information which the assessor may be able to
obtain . . ."
Section 1 of the same chapter and article provides: "All
property shall be assessed annually as of the first day of
appellants attacked a statute below, nor does the record contain any
evidence which could be relied upon to show that the validity of a
statute was drawn in question.

January at its true and actual value; . .
And Article
10, § 1 of the Constitution of West Virginia provides:
"... taxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the
State, and all property, both real and personal, shall be
taxed in proportion to its value to be ascertained as directed by law. No one species of property from which a
tax may be collected shall be taxed higher than any other
species of property of equal value." This section of the
constitution also provides for the division of all taxable
property into four classes, with a prescribed limitation on
the amount of tax which may be levied upon each class.
Class I consists of "personal property employed exclusively in agriculture, . . . products of agriculture . ..,
including livestock, while owned by the producer" and
includes "money, notes, bonds, bills and accounts receivable, stocks and other similar intangible personal property," which is the class of property for which appellants
are taxed.
Notwithstanding these provisions of the constitution
and statutes of the state, it appears from the evidence,
and the state Court of Appeals found, that in 1941, and
since, the assessor of Kanawha County, following the instructions of the state tax commissioner, employed a
different method in the valuation and assessment of the
property of building and loan associations and federal
savings and loan associations, including appellants, from
that employed in assessing Class I property of other taxpayers. It is this difference in the mode of assessing the
property of different taxpayers which petitioners contend
has resulted in taxing the property of appellants at its
full value and like property of other taxpayers at less
than its full valuation, in violation of the equal protection
clause.
It appears from the record that the assessor in 1941 for
the first time followed the uniform practice of assessing
the capital of building and loan associations and federal

CHARLESTON ASSN. v. ALDERSON.
182

Opinion of the Court.

loan associations as evidenced by their investment shares
and investment accounts, constituting their Class I intangibles, at their full value. But it also appears that in
assessing other taxpayers on their Class I property, the
assessor varied his method of assessment as to different
types of property included in the class. As to them he
valued money at 100%, bonds, notes and accounts receivable, except installment accounts, at about 70o of their
face value and installment accounts at 65% of their face
value. Livestock and agricultural products were valued
at approximately 50% of their "purchase value." The
accounts receivable and notes of small loan companies
were assessed at about 85% of their face value. It does
not appear how commercial banks and trust companies
were assessed, but for purposes of decision the state court
assumed that their Class I intangibles were assessed at
their full face value.
The Court of Appeals found that small loan companies
and other taxpayers whose Class I intangibles were taxed
at less than their face value are engaged in a business different from and involving a greater risk than that in which
building and loan associations and federal savings and loan
associations are engaged. It found that there was a basis
for the discount from face value employed in assessing
notes and accounts of small loan associations, which was
lacking in the assessment of the higher grade securities,
held by building and loan associations and federal savings
and loan associations, whose investments are generally
more carefully made and better secured than those of other
classes of taxpayers.
The court concluded that the method of assessment and
valuation employed was not adopted with the purpose
of taxing some but not all Class I property at less than
its true value, but as a means of arriving at its true value.
It said: "We do not have a case where the true and actual
value was ascertained and a discount allowed from that

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

324 U. S.

value; but rather a case where the discount was allowed,
particularly as to intangibles, in an effort to reach the
true value." While the court thought that this method
of assessment might in some instances be an erroneous
performance of the duties of the assessor, it held that a

mere error of judgment as to the mode of assessment
adopted was not sufficient to establish an unlawful discrimination "where the plan, though imperfect, is adopted
in a good faith effort to secure fair and equitable assessment, and equality and uniformity in taxation."
Appellants argue that denial to them of the equal protection of the laws is established by the proof of the assessor's discrimination in his mode of assessment of the
same kind of Class I property belonging to different taxpayers, and that this discrimination is shown to be "intentional and systematic." But this argument overlooks
the well established rule that the constitutional prohibition applies only to taxation which in fact bears unequally
on persons or property of the same class and that mere
differences in modes of assessment do not deny equal protection unless they are shown to produce such inequality.

County, supra, 447; Southern R. Co. v. Watts, supra;
Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 9.
In all these respects appellants have the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the assessments
which they assail, Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield,
supra, 353, and cases cited; Southern R. Co. v. Watts,
supra, 526; Chicago G. W. R. Co. v. Kendall, 266 U. S.

Great Northern R. Co. v. Weeks, supra, 139; Snowden v.
Hughes, supra, 9; and they have failed to sustain that
burden.
It is plain that the Fourteenth Amendment does not
preclude a state from placing notes and receivables in a
different class from personal property used in agriculture
and the products of agriculture, including livestock, and
taxing the two classes differently, even though the state
places them in a single class for other purposes of taxation.

the purpose of arriving at the true value of the property
assessed. In view of that conclusion and in the absence of
any finding or persuasive evidence to the contrary, we cannot say that the allowance of the discounts has in fact
resulted in the actual assessment of the intangibles of
taxpayers, other than appellants, at less than their true
value. Nor can we say that the discounts which were
denied to appellants on their Class I intangibles for the
first time in 1941 were intended to produce inequality in
taxation, or were part of a systematic effort to accomplish
that end, or in fact were more than errors in judgment, if
that, in the administration of the tax laws.
We find no persuasive evidence in the record and are
pointed to none from which it could be inferred that the
value of Class I intangibles of small loan companies and
other taxpayers in West Virginia, not subject to the same
supervision as appellants, is not generally less than face
value, or that the discount allowed by the assessor on the
intangibles of any given taxpayer or class of taxpayers
has in fact resulted in an assessment at less than their true
value. It follows that appellants have failed to sustain
the burden of showing that the assessments are unconstitutionally discriminatory, and the judgment must be

raises no substantial federal question and therefore concurs in its dismissal. For the same reason he thinks certiorari should be denied.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS.

I am of opinion the judgment should be reversed. I
think the evidence is not only without contradiction but
is persuasive that persons and corporations whose circumstances are precisely similar to those of the complaining taxpayers, and persons competing in the investment
