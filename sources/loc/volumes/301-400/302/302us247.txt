opposed to such procedure.
If the Court of Appeals had accepted the theory, it
would have been open to the taxpayer to urge, in view
of the new issue presented, that he should have the opportunity to establish before the Board additional facts
whicl would affect the result.' As we accept the new
theory, leave is granted Gowran to apply to the lower
court for that purpose.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

Messrs. John C. Altman and A. L. Nash argued the
cause for respondent. With Mr. Altman on the brief
was Mr. Roger S. Baldwin.
By leave of Court, Messrs. J. Harry Covington, John
Thomas Smith and Paul E. Shorb filed a brief as amici
curiae, in support of the respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case presents questions of income taxation applicable to stock dividends.
In 1931, Annie M. Pfeiffer, a holder of common stock
in William R. Warner Corporation, received as a dividend
thereon 6,29114 shares of its preferred stock. She also
received from the corporation in that year $200,000 cash
in exchange for 2,000 shares of its preferred stock which
she had received as a dividend in 1928. In her income
tax return for 1931, she did not include as taxable income either the preferred stock or the $200,000 cash. She
did not include the preferred stock received in that year,
because she deemed it exempt from taxation under § 115
(f) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 822.
She did not include the $200,000 cash as taxable income,
because she considered it the proceeds from the sale of
a capital asset. But she did include $180,100 thereof
as taxable capital gain on the sale, computing the gain
in accordance with the then effective Treasury Regulations. And she paid a tax of $22,512.50 on such capital
gain.
. The Commissioner assessed a deficiency on each item.
He determined that the 6,29114 shares of preferred stock
valued at $629,125, were taxable income of 1931, because
not exempt under § 115 (f); and that the $200,000 cash
were the proceeds of a redemption under § 115 (g), and
hence taxable income. He eliminated the taxable capi-

tal gain reported and assessed a deficiency on each of the
items.
The taxpayer sought a review by the Board of Tax
Appeals. It affirmed the Commissioner's determination
that the preferred stock received in 1931 was taxable income; but reversed his determination as to the proceeds
of the 2,000 shares, and said:
"The Commissioner held that the redemption of the
2,000 shares in 1931 was at such time and in such manner
as to be substantially equivalent to a taxable dividend
in 1931, within the meaning of section 115 (g) of the
Revenue Act of 1928. He erred in this since the distribution was subject to tax as a dividend in 1928 (see cases
above cited). Thereafter the shares had a basis for gain
or loss to the petitioner of $100 each, and they were redeemed without gain or loss to the petitioner at $100 each
in 1931."
The Commissioner acquiesced in the Board's decision.
The taxpayer sought a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It reversed the Board's decision as to the 1931
stock dividend, on the ground that § 115 (f) exempted
that dividend from taxation; and it affirmed the Board's
decision that the $200,000 cash was not taxable income
of 1931, saying, 88 F. (2d) 3, 5:
"The appellee argues that the proceeds from the redemption in 1931 of 2,000 shares of preferred stock distributed as a stock dividend in 1928 should be considered
either (a) subject to a tax as a capital gain or (b) subject
to taxation as the equivalent of the distribution of a taxable dividend pursuant to section 115 (g) of the Revenue
Act. The question of taxability as capital gain of the
$200,000 or any part thereof was not in issue before or
decided by the Board of Tax Appeals. The contention
that we have authority to sustain the deficiency pro
tanto even though the issue was not raised before th6
Board nor decided by it nor assigned as error in the

petition to this court for a review of the Board's decision
is untenable. General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, 296 U. S. 200, . .. ; Helvering v. Salvage, 297
U. S. 106, ....
The Board held that this stock dividend redeemed in 1931 at $100 per share was taxable in
the year 1928 when received and was therefore not taxable under section 115 (g); that it had a basis for gain
or loss of $100 per share; and that therefore there was
no taxable income from the redemption. The Commissioner did not file a cross-appeal. By the provisions of
section 115 (g) the proceeds of the redemption of the
stock can be taxed only if it occurs at such time and in
such manner as to make the redemption essentially
equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend.
Since the Board did not so find, we cannot support this
contention."
The Commissioner's petition for certiorari was granted
in connection with that in Helvering v. Gowran, ante,
p. 238, decided this day.
First. As to the 1931 dividend in preferred stock, the
Commissioner contends that the immunity from taxation
conferred by § 115 (f) did not extend to it. We hold, for
the reasons stated in Paragraph First of Helvering v.
Gowran, supra, that it was exempt from taxation.
Second. As to the $200,000 received in 1931, the Commissioner contends that the Circuit Court of Appeals
erred in failing to hold it taxable income, since under the
rule declared in Helvering v. Gowran, supra, the cost was
zero.
We are not at liberty to entertain that contention.
The Board of Tax Appeals decided that the $200,000 was
not taxable income of 1931. As the Commissioner did
not seek a review of that decision, which was adverse to
him, the Circuit Court of Appeals properly refused to
consider the contention. General Utilities & Operating

below may be sustained, without a cross-appeal, although
it was rested upon a wrong ground, see Helvering v. Gowran, supra, an appellee cannot without a cross-appeal attack a judgment entered below. Compare United States
v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435;
Morley Construction Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300
U. S. 185.' The same rule applies to a decision of the
Board of Tax Appeals.
Third. The Commissioner requests that, if we hold that
the Board erred in declaring that the 2,000 shares received in 1928 were then taxable and refuse to review its
decision that the proceeds received in 1931 were not taxable, we should remand the case to the Board to determine
whether redemption of the 2,000 shares was made at
such time and in such manner as to be essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend under-§ 115
(g). The Commissioner acquiesced in the decision of
the Board. No good reason is shown for disturbing it.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE and MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO think the
judgment should be reversed.
The issue before the Board of Tax Appeals was the
existence of a deficiency in respondent's income tax for
a single year, 1931. The deficiency fixed by the commissioner represented her net tax liability for that year
and drew in question every item which entered into computation of the tax. Lewis v. Reynolds, 284 U. S. 281,
283. Her appeal to the board drew in question her net
tax liability on a reexamination of every item of income in that year which she had challenged in her peti1 See also The Stephan .Morgan, 94 U. S. 599; Mount Pleasant v.

tion. The commissioner had treated as taxable income of
respondent two items, both received in that year, and
assessed a deficiency accordingly. They were a dividend
paid to the taxpayer in preferred stock, and cash received
by her in that year upon the redemption of preferred
stock received as a dividend in an earlier year. The Board
of Tax Appeals thought respondent was taxable in 1931
on the first but not on the second item, and reduced the
deficiency accordingly. It "Ordered and decided, that
there is a deficiency for the year 1931 in the amount of
$89,841.75."
This Court, upon consideration of the facts stipulated
by the parties and found by the board, holds that respondent was taxable upon the full amount of the item
of cash received but not upon the stock dividend. But,
because the commissioner took no appeal from the order of
the board, the Court declines to give any effect to its
ruling that the cash is taxable income in 1931. If the
commissioner had sought only to increase the deficiency
found by the board, it may be conceded that the point
would be well taken, but such is not his purpose. On
the contrary, he accepts the order and relies upon it as
establishing a deficiency of which he asks the benefit
only so far as it is sustained by the application, to the
facts found, of the rule of law announced by this Court.
The circumstance that the board, by the erroneous application of a rule of law to the facts before it arrived at
a deficiency which is sustained by a correct application
of a different rule, is not ground for setting aside its order.
Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531, 538-539; Anderson v. Atherton, post, p. 643; compare Morley Construction Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185. In
denying to the commissioner any benefit of the order
because he did not appeal, the opinion of the Court gives
no hint of any ground upon which the commissioner
should or could have appealed so far as the order fixes
a deficiency which the record shows is lawfully due or

Syllabus.
why the respondent is not free to maintain that the board
reached the right result even though the reason it gave
was wrong.
The cause should be remanded to the Board of Tax
Appeals to recompute the deficiency in conformity with
the rule of tax liability laid down in the opinion of this
Court, but in an amount not exceeding that which the
board has found.
General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering, 296
U. S. 200, does not require any different result. There it
was held that it was error for the circuit court of appeals,
on an appeal by the commissioner, to reverse an order
of the board and remand the cause for new findings to
support a theory of tax liability which first emerged from
the case on appeal. Here there is no new issue to be
tried by the board. The only issue is one of law which
this Court has resolved and which has been implicit in
the case from the beginning.
