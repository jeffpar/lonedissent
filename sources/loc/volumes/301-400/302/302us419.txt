v. INDIANAPOLIS WATER CO.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 90.

Argued December 15, 1937.-Decided January 3, 1938.

1. A suit for a permanent injunction of state-made rates alleged
to be confiscatory, no interlocutory injunction being prayed, is
properly'heard in the District Court by one judge. P. 420.
2. In a suit praying a permanent, but not a temporary, injunction
against state-made rates already in effect, upon the ground of
confiscation, it was erroneous to value the plaintiff's property
as of the date of decree upon proofs taken and concluded thirtytwo months previously and to dismiss the bill on that valuation,
without regard to known economic changes, and the actual results
of the plaintiff's business, in the interval. P. 422.
89 F. (2d) 522, affirmed with modification.
CERTIORARI, post, p. 665, to review the reversal of a decree, 13 F. Supp. 110, which dismissed a bill to enjoin the
enforcement of water rates fixed by the Public Service
Commission of Indiana.

Mr. Urban C. Stover, with whom Messrs Floyd J.
Mattice, Edward H. Knight and James E. Deery were on
the brief, for petitioners.
Messrs. William L. Ransom, Joseph J. Daniels and G. R.
Redding were on the brief for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

This sut was originally brought by the Indianapolis
Water Company to restrain the enforcement of an order
of the Public Service Commission of Indiana fixing a
temporary schedule of rates pending the Commission's
investigation. The District Court of three judges (28
U. S. C. 380) denied an interlocutory injunction and the
temporary rates became effective. The Commission on

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

December 30, 1932, adopted a different and permanent
schedule of rates to be effective January 1, 1933. The
Company then filed an amended and supplemental bill
assailing those rates as confiscatory and invoking the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States. An interlocutory injunction was not
sought and the case was properly heard in the District
Court by a single judge. indianapolis Water Co. v.
McCart, 13 F. Supp. 107; Smith v. Wilson, 273 U. S.
388; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., 282
U. S; 10; Healy v. Ratta, 289 U. S. 701. Pursuant to
the Commission's final order, the Company filed the
schedule of rates as prescribed, and these rates went into
effect on January 1, 1933, and under that order have
since been in effect without limitation of time.
The Commission found that the fair value of the Company's property as of November 1, 1932, was not less than
$22,500,000 and that the income under the new rates
would be "approximately $1,400,000, or a return slightly
in excess of six per cent" on that amount. The District
Court appointed a Special Master,. who received evidence
between May 1, 1933, and August 10, 1933, and held a
further and reopened session on October 18, 1933, when
the hearing of evidence was closed. On April 18, 1934,
the Master offered to receive evidence as to the actual
operations of the Company for 1933 but the respective
parties informed the Master that they did not desire to
offer any such testimony. The Master filed his report on
May 18, 1934. The appraisals before the Master were
made as of April 1, 1933. He found the fair value of
the Company's property to be $20,282,143 as of that date
and also as of the time of filing his report. He estimated
and found that the income applicable to return for the
year 1933 and for a reasonable time thereafter would be
$1,294,566.51. He concluded that the rates were not
confiscatory.

McCART v. INDIANAPOLIS WATER CO. 421

Opinion of the Court.

After a hearing upon exceptions to the Master's report, the District Court entered a final decree on November 29, 1935, dismissing the amended and supplemental
bill of complaint. 13 F. Supp. 110. The court found
that the value of the Company's property was $21,392,821 as of April 1, 1933, and although the evidence of
value had been addressed to that date, the court went
further and found in its decree that this amount "was
the fair and reasonable value thereof as of the time of
filing the report of the Special Master herein and as
of the date of these findings and that such value will
continue to be a fair and reasonable value of the plaintiff's used and useful property for a reasonable time in
the future." The court adopted the finding of the
Master that the income would be not less than $1,294,566.51 for the year 1933 and for a reasonable time thereafter.
Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, reviewing
the evidence upon disputed points, found that there
should be certain increases, amounting to $975,437, in
the rate base, making it $22,368,258. The court observed that from April 1, 1933, the valuation date, to the
date of the decree of the District Court, November 29,
1935, thirty-two months had intervened; that this period
was no longer one for prophecy but had passed ".from the
field of speculation to one of expevience"; and that experience had shown that .in that period there had been
"a constant and definite trend upward in commodity
values." 89 F. (2d) 522, 525, 526. With respect to income, the court said that the amount found by the
Master for 1933 ($1,294,566.51) was about $57,000 higher
than that indicated by the testimony of any witness, but
the finding was not overruled in view of the failure of the
Company to take advantage of its opportunity to show
the actual receipts and disbursements for that calendar
year. Id., pp. 527, 528. Holding that the District Court

had erred inl determining in its decree that the valuations as of April 1, 1933, were applicable to the date of
the decree in November, 1935, without taking appropriate
account of changed conditions in the interval, the court
reversed the decree and rema~hded the cause for further
proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in
its opinion. Id., p. 528.
Petitioners urge that the Court of Appeals has virtually
required the District Court to find confiscation. We do
not think that this is the necessary import of the opinion.
The appellate court took judicial notice of an upward
trend in prices but did not attempt to make a specific
application of that trend. The reversal of the- decree
requires a hearing anew in the District Court, and upon
that hearing all questions pertinent to the issue of confiscation should be open. The economic changes to
which the Court of Appeals has referred may affect income as well as values.
In the instant case, we do not have a situation in which
rates as fixed by a Commission have been enjoined.
Here the rates prescribed by the Commission's order have
been- in effect all through this litigation, and are now in
effect. A decree for injunction could operate only as: to
the future. Another special circumstance is that the decree of the District Court expressly -provided that the
value it found was the value as of the date of the decree,
November 29, 1935, although the evidence before the court
related to April 1, 1933. A decree speaking as of the
later date and operating thereafter should have a basis
in evidence. On the hearing required by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, the District Court will be able to ascertain what have been the actual results of the Company's
business during the intervening years and thus to base its
decree upon known conditions as to those years which
may show clearly, in the light of the economic changes
which have occurred, whether the prescribed rates are or

are not of a confiscatory character .and whether an injunction restraining the enforcement of the rates should
be granted or denied.
To leave no question as to the authority of the District
Court thus fully to rehear and determine the cause the
decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is modified so as
to provide that the cause is remanded to the District
Court for further proceedings in conformity with the
views expressed in this opinion. As thus modified, the
decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.
Modified and affirmed.

dissenting.
I cannot agree that this cause brought here by the
Public Service Commission and the Attorney General of
the State of Indiana should be sent back to the District
Court for a new trial. After an examination of the record,
I am persuaded that the action of the Court of Appeals
was wrong and that its judgment should not be affirmed
either as rendered or in any modified form. The importance of the questions here involved leads me to set
out some of my reasons for this belief.
Six years ago (1931) the City of Indianapolis filed a
petition with the Public Service Commission of Indiana
against the Indianapolis Water Company, seeking a reduction of water rates for small consumers. The commission
fixed the rates in December, 1932. A master appointed by
the District Court reported that there was no confiscation
May 18, 1934. The District Court held there was no
confiscation November, 1935. The Court of Appeals
found there was confiscation March, 1937. Now, January,
1938, this Court sends the case back to the District Court
for trial "anew." The cause goes back to the District
Court with the admonition from the Court of Appeals
MR. JUSTICE BLACK,

424

302 U. S.

that a "general and persistent rise in prices should have
been given effect in fixing a fair valuation." Affirmance
of the Court of Appeals' decree necessarily approves this
statement and this statement requires an increased valuation of the Company's property. Experience demonstrates that rate bases continue to come to this Court
until final decisions are reached. If the second trial follows the course of the first, the case should return to this
Court by 1943. However, it will now be the duty of the
District Court, in trying the case anew, to make a forecast as to probable commodity values covering this future
period up to 1943.1 If its forecast should be wrong, the
present case will be a precedent for reversing the cause in
1943 for still another trial. Sending the case back indicates that the Court of Appeals was right in reversing the
District Court.
I believe the Court of Appeals was in error, that the
evidence did not show confiscation, and I cannot agree
to the action of the majority. This Court has announced
the doctrine that the States have full and complete rights
to regulate the rates of local intrastate utilities and that
the federal courts cannot and will not interfere with this
regulation unless the rates are confiscatory. Furthermore, "upon that question .(of confiscation) the complainant has the burden of proof and the Court may not
interfere with the exercise of the State's authority unless
confiscation is clearly established." ' 2 The judicial function does not extend beyond the decision of the constitutional question. Unless, therefore, the water company
satisfactorily overcame the presumption that the rate set
by the commission is not confiscatory, this Court should
not invade the constitutional sphere of state rate
regulation.'

J., dissenting.

I cannot say that the evidence in the District Court
"compelled a conviction that the rate would prove inadequate"; or that the rates were "palpably and grossly
unreasonable"; ' nor was the evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that the rates, as fixed by the
commission and reinforced by the judgment of the master
and the District Court, were not confiscatory.'
The master reported the value of the Company's property to be $20,282,143.00 as of April 1, 1933. December,
1935, the District Court after a review of the evidence
and the report of the master, refused to enjoin the enforcement of the rates fixed by the commission. That
court excluded from consideration for rate making purposes a group of farms owned by the Company and estimated by the master to have a value of $264,050.00, but
increased the master's estimate of the value of "water
rights" to $500,000.00. Evidence having been given of
the "reproduction value" of the Company's property,
the District Court increased by $1,333,333.00 the master's
"estimate" of the "estimated cost" of labor necessary to
"reproduce" the Company's property; it raised the master's total "estimate" of this wholly imaginary reproduction from $20,282,143.00 to $21,392,821.00.
March 23, 1937, six years after the City of Indianapolis
had originally initiated its efforts to obtain a reduction in
water rates, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded
this cause. In doing so, it ordered that the Company's
Indiana farms be included in the total valuation upon
which the people of Indianapolis must pay the Company an income; added $361,308.00 to the "estimate" of
the master and District Court for "undistributed construction costs"; and raised "going value" $250,079.00.

The principal reason given for the reversal, however,
was that general price levels had risen, during the thirtytwo months intervening between the date at which valuations were fixed (April 1, 1933) to the date of the District
Court's decree (November 29, 1935). Looking at price
index figures, the Court of Appeals decided that prices
had ascended about twenty-five per cent. during that
period, and that if the District Court had given proper
consideration to this increase in determining the value
of the Company's property, that court would have
found that the rate fixed by the commission was "clearly
confiscatory."
One month and three days, however, after the price
index method had been used by the Court of Appeals
in finding the Indianapolis water rates confiscatory, this
Court, in the case of Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public
Utilities Comm'n, 301 U. S. 292, struck down a reduced
telephone rate fixed by the Ohio Public Service Commission. The people of Ohio were deprived of the benefit of a reduced telephone rate because the decision of the
Public Service Commission rested upon price indices.
Yet, if the District Court follows the opinion of the
Court of Appeals which is here affirmed, the people of
Indianapolis will be deprived of a reduced water rate
because a price index, not introduced in evidence, indicated to the Court of Appeals that the valuation fixed by
the District Court was wrong. This opinion of the
Court of Appeals as to value is not repudiated by the
affirmance. The majority does not reverse the Court of
Appeals' finding of confiscation.
I cannot agree that the District Court should be reversed for failure to prophesy the exact future course of
commodity prices. The legal knowledge of few judges is
such that they can accurately foresee and forecast all
price fluctuations. In the delays incident to rate litigation it is probably true that prices will fluctuate many

times between the beginning of a litigation and the time
when the cause is won, lost or abandoned.
It has now been more than five years since the commission fixed a valuation for this water works property and it
has been more than four years since the master reached
his conclusion. If it requires four more years for this case
to return to the Court of Appeals, there can be no doubt
but that some price index can be found to show other
changes in prices. Such a result will add still further to
the confusion and chaos of judicial rate making. I believe
it forecasts a day when the present long delays in rate
regulation will be endless.
The City .of Indianapolis should not be subjected to
another trial unless this Court believes the rates to be
confiscatory. When the District Court tries the case anew
it will be constrained to follow the decision of the Court
of Appeals that a "general and persistent rise in prices
should have been given effect in fixing a fair valuation."
In the meantime, can a judge be found who can accurately
divine all future prices of commodities to be used for
imaginary reproductions of this Company's property?
I believe this cause should be brought to a conclusion
at this time." My belief that the Court of Appeals should
be reversed is strengthened by a study of the record in the
case of McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U. S.
400, of which record we take judicial notice."
For the first hundred years of this Nation's history, federal courts did not interfere with state legislation fixing
maximum rates for public services performed within the
respective states. The state legislatures, according to a
custom which this Court declared had existed "from time
immemorial" ' decided what those maximum rates should

be. This Court also said that "for protection against
abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls,
not to the courts." 0 Itwas not until 1890 that a divided
court finally repudiated its earlier constitutional interpretation and declared that due process of law requires
judicial invalidation of legislative rates which the courts
believe confiscatory." The dissenting Justices adhered
to the long existing principle that regulation of public
utilities was a "legislative prerogative and not a judicial
one." 12

From this decision in 1890, supra, has come the doctrine that the federal courts have jurisdiction to determine whether a rate fixed by a state for a purely local
utility is confiscatory. This doctrine does not purport to
give to federal courts more than the limited jurisdiction to determine whether a given state rate is so low as to
be confiscatory.
The determination by the Court of Appeals that the
rates in the present case are confiscatory can only be
supported, if at all, by giving undeserved weight to evidence given to support the "reproduction cost" theory.

The experience of the people of Indianapolis in their efforts to obtain fair and reasonable water rates from this
company which has long had a monopoly in their community, discloses what appears to me to be the complete
unreliability of the "reproduction cost" theory. Whereever the question of utility valuation arises today, it is
exceedingly difficult to discern the truth through the maze
of formulas and the jungle of metaphysical concepts sometimes conceived, and often fostered, by the ingenuity
of those who seek inflated valuations to support excessive rates. Even the testimony of engineers, with wide

experience in developing this theory and expounding it to
courts, is not in agreement as to the meaning of the vague
and uncertain terms created to add invisible and intangible values to actual physical property. Completely lost
in the confusion of language-too frequently invented for
the purpose of confusing-commissions and courts passing upon rates for public utilities are driven to listen to
conjectures, speculations, estimates and guesses, all under
the name of "reproduction costs." In the testimony of
professional witnesses*iemployed by the litigants, courts
listen to guesses about "going value"; "undistributed construction costs"; "water rights." 13 This Court has even
said, "Reproduction value, however, is not a matter of
outlay, but of estimate, and .. .proof of actual expenditures originally made, while it would be helpful, is not
indispensable." '" [Italics added.] Courts have gone
further arid further away from considering cost in determining the value of utility property. The cost of this
Company's property apparently was given little weight

in previous litigation which came to this Court."5 This
Company's property was valued by this Court at $19,000,000.00 in the prior litigation although the commission's
valuation was $16,495,000.00. It is interesting to note
what this property, valued at $19,000,000.00 actually
cost.
The record in the McCardle case, supra, showed: that
the property was bought at a judicial sale in 1881 by the
present Company at a cost of not more than $535,000.00,
the purchase being financed by a sale of bonds; that apparently no cash was paid for the $500,000.00 face value
of stock issued at that time; that the maximum book
value of the Company's assets on December 31, 1923,
was $9,195,908.00 but a witness called by the commission
testified that the Company's records disclosed the actual
book value of the property used for the public convenience
to be only $7,967,649.00; that from 1881 to December
31, 1923, stockholders' average annual net profits were
$189,255.00; that practically all of the added book value
was the result of additional investments financed by borrowing and not by investment by stockholders; that no
other investment was made by the stockholders in the
Company since 1881, but, in 1909 a write-up of $5,556,071.85 was made on the books by virtue of which a common stock dividend of $4,500,000.00 was declared in 1910,
making the total common stock $5,000,000.00; that the
$5,000,000.00 stock was thereafter carried on the books of
the Company; that the stockholders not only paid no additional money for stock, but that the profits made by the
Company between 1881 and 1932 were not reinvested in
the Company but were substantially all drawn out in
dividends."6
See McCardle v,. Indianapolis Water Co., supra.
16 The books of the company indicate that the company spent for
additions between 1881 and December 31, 1923, $8,112,399.00 but

This Court found in the McCardle case that the Company was entitled to a rate based on a $19,000,000.00
valuation as of December 31, 1923, although the record
indicates: that the total actual investment made by the
Company up to that time was less than $9,000,000.00
and was not stockholders' investment but was substantially all borrowed money; that the stockholders apparently had made no investment unless (which is very
doubtful from the record) they paid for the $500,000.00
stock in 1881; and that the stockholders had received the
following percentage of return on common stock on a
$500,000.00 valuation for the five years preceding this

While it is difficult to find in the present record what
additional investments have been made since the $19,000,000.00 appraisal, it does appear that the commission found
debtedness Qf the company on which it paid interest was $8,231,000.00.
During the same period, from 1881 to December 31, 1923, the books
showed available for dividends $8,337,232.74. Dividends paid out
were as follows:

During the same period the record shows that interest was paid by
the company on the bods issued to the stockholders as dividends
and that interest amounted to $3,076,250.00.
It thus appears from the books that the stockholders received an
average of practically 38% profit on $500,000.00 from 1881 to December 31, 1923.

that the books of the Company showed an additional investment of $6,661,292.00. If this is added to the 1923
book value, it would appear that there is a possibility
that when the appraisal in this cause was made, there
may have been between $13,000,000.00 and $16,000,000.00
invested through the Company's borrowing activities.
But the indebtedness kept pace with the investments and
was $13,746,900.00 at this time. The District Court is
now reversed, however, because the Court of Appeals
found that rates based on an obviously inflated value of
$21,392,821.00 fixed by the District Court would confiscate the property of the Company's stockholders.
There is a marked disparity between the actual cost
of this Company's property and its imaginary "reproduction value." I shall comment upon a few of many reasons for this disparity.
First, the so-called "water rights"-The Company takes
the position that water rights should have been valued at
about $2,000,000.00. Expert witnesses for the city valued
these rights from nothing to $75,000.00, and expert
witnesses for the Company at $1,000,000.00 or more.
This illustration is typical of the wide variations in expert evidence on -"reproduction cost"; it is a typical
"estimate." The Company claims that the element of
greatest value in the water rights is the "diversion right."
This "diversion right" is based, in part, on the theory
that for a long number of years the Company has diverted
water from the White River. According to one theory,
it is claimed water which would otherwise flow down
stream is diverted by the Company; that the Tom Taggart Park in Indianapolis might possibly be injured by
this diversion (but the city has not complained); that
the stream offers possibilities of scenic beauty if there
were adequate water and if it should be made suitable
for navigation by small pleasure craft. It does not appear that this formula evolved as a result of anyone's

McCART v. INDIANAPOLIS WATER CO. 433

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

expressed or frustrated desire to sail this stream. From
the possibility, however, that the stream could be used
for this purpose if imaginary people should so desire, an
imaginary damage to these imaginary sailors is discovered.
Based upon this potential menace to these imaginary
people and their imaginary desire to use this stream, an
imaginary value of $200,000.00 is suggested as the cost
which the Company might incur in discharging its
imaginary duty to improve the stream for these imaginary
sailors.
It is difficult to believe that such concepts of property
can establish clear proof that the Constitution of the
United States has been violated. Nor do I believe that,
even if the people of Indianapolis and the surrounding
community have permitted the Water Company to use
this stream for a public service, there has been a grant
of a prescriptive property right which can be capitalized
by the Company, in 6rder to exact higher water rates
from the very people who granted the privilege.
If the Company had made actual investments in its
property between 1933 and 1935, resort to illusory property concepts would not be necessary. Clearly, it would
be entitled to a reasonable return upon such actual investment. Such is not the case. The order for a new
trial is not based on a claim that the Company has invested even one additional dollar. It is not claimed that
the Company bought additional land; added an inch
to any of its dams; extended its distribution pipes; improved its filtration system; or purchased one additional
piece of property.
This Court has frequently declared that in reaching
a conclusion as to a reasonable rate, the public must be
considered as well as the stockholders' and bondholders. 17
The doctrine against confiscatory rates is based upon

the theory of protecting the right of bondholders to their
interest and that of stockholders to a fair return upon
the value of their actual investments. While this matter
has been confused by the "reproduction cost" theory, the
fact remains that, as applied to corporations, it is the
interest of the stockholders and bondholders which the
due process clause protects.
The evidence in this case clearly establishes that the
bondholders have never been; and are not now, in any
jeopardy as to their interest payments. In the margin
appears the record of stockholders' dividends since the
$19,000,000.00 valuation. 8 In view of these dividends
on this stock of uncertain cost, these stockholders were in
no imminent peril because of the District Court's valuation of more than $21,000,000.00.

legislature fixing the maximum passenger rates for railroad 6ompanies to be unconstitutional, on the ground that its enforcement

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

This case is an illustration of the almost insuperable
obstacles to rate regulation today. It involves a single
Company supplying water to a single community. It
does not present the difficulties of a far-flung utility system covering much territory with many separate corporate creatures. Nevertheless, this particular case has
already consumed more than six years and is apparently
destined to remain suspended for six more years. 9 More
than 2000 pages of records and exhibits appear in this
Court in the appeal.
This case was first heard by the Public Service Commission. Evidence and arguments were there introduced
and the questions of value, rates, etc., were fully explored. Thereafter the Commission which had been specially created by the State of Indiana to investigate
such cases rendered its decree.
Next, the case was investigated by a master in the District Court. This Court has admonished the lower court

that a master should be appointed for such purposes.
Extensive hearings before the master produced voluminous
testimony at tremendous expense to the litigants. While
this expense may appear on the books of the Company it
will ultimately be borne by the consumers.
After the master heard the evidence, it went to the District Court for a third review. Thereafter it appeared in
the Court of Appeals where it was again reviewed. Since
it has come to this Court, I believe that the ends of justice
require that it be concluded. History indicates that if it
is not concluded, this is not likely to be the last journey
made by the cause from Indianapolis to Washington.
Litigation costs in rate regulation today constitute a
heavy burden.
In the main, the dispute in this case, as in most rate
cases, revolves around "intangibles" and "reproduction
costs."
"Intangibles," as expounded by hired experts in rate
litigations, might well be defined as "properties" that can
neither be seen nor touched and which can rarely be
understood. They can have little meaning when applied
to property. which is not for sale but for use. These
property concepts are so uncertain, tenuous and elusive
that no two witnesses give them the same value except
on occasions when several witnesses have been employed
by the same litigant.2
Witnesses in the present case varied as to "organization" costs from $81,000.00 to $325,000.00. Experts
differed as to "going value" between $1,000,000.00 and
$2,700,000.00, and on water rights from nothing to
$2,000,000.00.

Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Tompkins, 176 U. S. 167.
For example, in the McCardle case, supra, the highest estimate
was three times as great as the lowest. See Brandeis, J., dissenting,

BLAcK, J., dissenting.

Such differences are not exceptional. They occur in
most cases that have reached this Court which involve
expert appraisal of such phantom concepts of property.
The estimates made by witnesses of "reproduction
costs" of pipes for this water-works system strikingly
illustrate this method of valuation. A Company expert
estimated that the reproduction cost of the Company's
"main" pipes, as of 1923, was $7,024,289.00. In this
guess it was assumed that the pipe had a life of 125
years and that "as a matter of fact, it does not wear out in
use." If these pipes last 125 years, the reproduction cost
theory will subject the water consumers of Indianapolis
to innumerable increases in the price of water during
the next century. Experts can undoubtedly be found
who will testify from time to time during the coming century, that the hypothetical digging up of old pipes and
the hypothetical laying of hypothetical new pipes, will
constantly increase the hypothetical reproduction value
of pipes. In fact the actual pipes will not be dug up.
They will continue to lie untouched and at rest-under
the soil.
Under this reproduction cost theory, the constitutional
water rate in Indianapolis must fluctuate during the next
century with the price of cast iron pipes. One of the
principal elements of the so-called "reproduction value"
in this case is this very pipe. I do not believe that the
constitutionality of action by a sovereign State of this
Union is dependent upon the market fluctuations of
cast iron pipe.
Testimony was given in this case as to the "reproduction cost" of a canal used by the water company. The
State of Indiana constructed this canal for navigation
purposes a hundred years ago. Some years after its completion, it was obtained by the Water Works Company
of Indianapolis and, while the record is not clear, the
price might have been as great as $35,000.00. When the

reorganization of the company occurred in 1881, this
canal was placed upon the books of the present company
at $50,000.00. It remained on the books at this figure
until the write-up in 1909 which preceded the $4,500,000.00 stock dividend. At that time, it was hoisted to
$1,773,874.00. By 191.1, this same canal apparently was
carried at $2,746,538.00. In the rate valuation case in
1923, experts of the Company valued it at more than
$3,000,000.00. Extensive testimony has been given in this
and the McCardle case, supra, concerning the "reproduction value" of this canal. The expert who was "reproducing" the canal in 1923 "assumed a similar set of conditions to those existing at the time the canal was originally constructed." In other words, the witness took himself and his staff back a hundred years to the conditions
that existed in Indiana at the time and place of the construction of this State navigation canal. Thus projecting himself back into history, he found that the water
consumers of Indianapolis should pay to the present
owners of the canal 6% income on more than $3,000,000.00. I cannot subscribe to the belief that it would
violate the C6ristitution of the United States for the State
of Indiana to deny the Company 6% income on a still
higher valuation of a canal that never, at the outside, cost
the Company more than $50,000.00. The question in the
federal courts in connection with rates is not what would
be a reasonable rate to be charged by such a company,
but it is limited wholly and exclusively to a decision as
to whether or not a rate will confiscate the property of the
company. The evidence in this case is not so "compelling" as to justify a reversal of the District Court's valuation, which valuation, itself, necessarily contains a
finding of value far in excess of what this canal cost or
what it is reasonably worth. In a dissenting opinion by
certain commissioners of the Public Service Commission
of Indiana in the McCardle case, they said:

McCART v. INDIANAPOLIS WATER CO. 439
419

BLACK,

J., dissenting.

"Would any reasonable man entertain the proposition
of duplicating the canal, if a new water works system were
to be constructed in Indianapolis? Certainly not.
"In the estimated reconstruction new cost there is the
highly fancied estimate of the cost of duplicating the
canal as it was constructed ninety years ago. It would
be just as germane to the ascertainment of the actual
value of the petitioner's property used and useful in the
present water service of Indianapolis to indulge in a
magnified imagination of the expense of repopulating
the canal banks with the Indians."
The State of Indiana did not appeal from the judgment
of the District Court. We, therefore, are not called upon
to decide whether the rates now in force are so extortionate
as to confiscate the property of the consumers. The Company appealed from the District Court seeking a higher
valuation. The Court of Appeals decided that the Company was entitled to a higher valuation.
As a reason for reversing and remanding this cause,
the majority opinion points to the fact that no interlocutory injunction has been issued. I'believe that the
fact that no injunction was issued after the Public Service Commission of Indiana, the master in the federal
court, and the District Court had all found that the rates
were not confiscatory, is but an added reason why this
Court should not agree to overturn that finding and
should reverse the cause. It will be wholly impossible
in my judgment for any trial court to.try this cause again
free from the plain implication, in the action of this
Court, that the value of the Company's property should
be found to be approximately twenty-five per cent. greater
than $22,000,000.00. How can any trial court ignore
the fact that the Court of Appeals has indicated a strong
belief that the value should be raised twenty-five per
cent.0 How can any trial court escape the conclusion
that an injunction should now be issued to prevent the
enforcement of the rates that have been in effect?

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
BLACxk, J., dissenting.

302 U. S.

There is nothing strange or unusual about the decree of
the District Court fixing a value as of November 23, 1935,
as well as of April 1, 1933. Any other action by the court
would have gone directly in the teeth of the plain mandates of this Court in other cases. Not only was the District Court compelled to attempt to find the value as of
1933 and as of 1935, but under the opinions of this Court
it was necessary that it attempt to lift the veil of the
future, peer into its mysteries, and determine the value
of the Company's property for a reasonable time after
1935. Its action was dictated by the command of this
Court that "an honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values made upon a view of all relevant
circumstances, is essential." Missouri ex rel. S. W. Bell
Tel. Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 262 U. S. 276, 288.
If this language was not sufficient as an imperative admonition for the judge to become a prophet, there was the
statement made by this Court in connection with the
appraisal of this particular Company's property in
McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U. S. 400, 408,
409, that: "It must be determined whether the rates complained of are yielding and will yield . . . a reasonable
ratz of return on the value of the property at the time of
the investigation and for a reasonable time in the immediate future." [Italics added.] Surely it is not a ground
for reversing the cause now that the District Court has
followed these instructions. Is the majority overruling
these cases? Must the District Court, when the case is
tried "anew," obey the former mandates "to prophesy"
or does the opinion of the majority mean it should not
prophesy? If the trial court does prophesy, and human
fallibility brings error into the prophecy, will this Court
again six years hence, reverse and remand for another
trial "anew"? I believe this affirmance adds additional
uncertainty to the existing chaos of rules and formulas
created by judicial pronouncement in the field of rate

litigation. I further believe it to be wrong to send this
case back for another trial, because I believe the record
affirmatively shows that the consumers of water in
Indianapolis are already compelled to pay an unjustifiable
price for their water on account of previous judicial overvaluation of this property.
I believe the State of Indiana has the right to regulate
the price of water in Indianapolis free from interference
by federal courts. The courts did not deny this right to
the states for the first hundred years after the adoption
of the Constitution.22 But even under the comparatively
recent doctrine purporting to give federal courts jurisdiction to invalidate rates fixed by a state, I am of the
opinion that the fe~ieral courts have no jurisdiction to
proceed in this cause. I base this belief on the record
which does not show clearly that the stockholders of the
Indianapolis Water Company have ever made any substantial investment which could be confiscated. I further believe that the evidence does not clearly establish
that the rates fixed by the commission will fail to provide
an income amply adequate to pay all interest on the
Company's funded debt and provide far more than a 6%
profit on any actual value in excess of the borrowed capital
remaining unpaid. I, therefore, believe that this Court
should order this cause dismissed for want of jurisdiction
or. that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals
should be reversed and the opinion of the District Court
dismissing the Company's bill should be affirmed.
