frauds. It is cheating the Government at which the statute aims and Congress was entitled to protect the Government against those who would swindle it regardless of
questions of constitutional authority as to the operations
that the Government is conducting. Such questions cannot be raised by those who make false claims against the
Government. See Langer v. United States, 76 F. (2d)

The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 202.

Argued November 15, 1937.-Decided December 6, 1937.

1. Registration of stills for the production of distilled spirits should
be with the District Supervisor of the Alcohol Tax Unit in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. P. 219.
A count charging conspiracy to commit the offense of possessing
such stills "without haying the same registered with the Collector
of Internal Revenue, as required by law," is therefore bad. (Cf.
Rev. Stats. ยง 3258; 26 U. S. C. ยง 1162.)
2. When the first of several counts upon which consecutive sentences are based is defective the sentences should be corrected so
as to fix a .definite date for their commencement. P. 220.'

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Isadore G. Stone, Alfred A. May, and Arthur
H. Ratner were on the brief and submitted the case for
the petitioners.
Mr. Bates Booth, with whom Solicitor General Reed,
Assistant Attorney General McMahon, and Messrs. Mahlon D. Kiefer and W. Marvin Smith were on the brief,
for the United States.
PER CURIAM.

Judgments of conviction on four counts of an indictment charging conspiracies to violate provisions of the
internal revenue laws were affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals. 91 F. (2d) 404. Certiorari was granted, limited to the question whether the first count of the indictment states an offense under federal law.
The first count alleged that defendants from October 1,
1934, to the date of the indictment, October 30, 1935, unlawfully conspired to possess, and cause to be possessed,
stills and apparatus for the production of distilled spirits
without having the same registered with the Collector of
Internal Revenue as required by law. The Government
concedes that under the applicable law the charge should
have been that there was failure to register the stills with
the District Supervisor of the Alcohol Tax Unit in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. The first count failed to
state an offense. Act of March 3, 1927, c. 348, 44 Stat.

of May 27, 1930, c. 342, 46 Stat. 427; Regulations No. 3,

posed on count one." Each of the sentences on the remaining counts runs from the expiration of the term of
imprisonment imposed on the preceding count. In view
of the invalidity of the. sentence on count one, the sentences on the remaining counts should be amended so as
to fix a definite date for their commencement.
The judgments on count one are severally reversed and
the causes are remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.
FORTE v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 459.

Argued November 15, 1937.--Decided December 6, 1937.

1. A bill nf exceptions agreed to by counsel and filed with the clerk
of the District Court within the time allowed for settlement by
No. IX of the Criminal Appeals Rules, but not settled and signed
by the judge until afterwards, is not settled in time. P. 223.
If the trial judge is absent from the district, the rule permits
settlement by any other judge assigned to hold, or holding, the
court in which the case was tried.
2. Where the Court of Appeals decides a criminal appeal for the
appellant upon the assumption that the bill of exceptions is
properly before it, and the objection that the bill was not settled in time is first made by the Government's petition for rehearing, that court, exercising its broad authority under Rule No.
IV, may, in the interest of justice, refuse to strike the bill of exceptions and may approve the settlement and filing theretofore
had. P. 223.

Mr. Henry A. Schweinhaut, with whom Solicitor General Reed, Assistant Attorney General McMahon and
Messrs. William W. Barron and W. Marvin Smith were
on the brief, for the United States.
No brief filed on behalf of Forte.
