1. An Act merely fixing the terms or the tenures of public employees
is presumptively not intended to create a vested right in the incumbent, but merely to declare a policy to be pursued until the
legislature shall ordain otherwise. P. 78.

a case has the burden of overcoming the presumption. P. 79.

brief, for appellants.
Mr. Frank S. Righeimer, with whom Messrs. Richard
S. Folsom, Barnet Hodes, Ralph W. Condee, and Frank
R. Schneberger were on the brief, for appellees.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The appellants challenge an Act of Illinois which they
assert impairs the obligation of contracts in contravention of Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the
United States and deprives them of a vested right without due process contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.
The statute decreased the amounts of annuity payments
to retired teachers in the public schools of Chicago.'
Since 1895 the State has had legislation creating a
teachers' pension and retirement fund, originally the fruit
of teachers' contributions and gifts or legacies, but later
augmented by allotments from interest received and from
taxes. With this fund and the benefit payments thereunder we are not concerned.
Prior to 1917 teachers in the Chicago schools were
employed for such terms as the Board of Education
might fix.' In that year an Act was passed providing
for a probationary period of three years and prohibiting
removal thereafter except for cause.'
I The Act embraces teachers, principals, district superintendents,
and assistant superintendents, and retired members of those classes
are among the appellants. For the sake of brevity all will be
denominated teachers.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Coilrt.

302 U. S.

In 1926 an Act known as the "Miller Law,"' became
effective. This provided for compulsory retirement and
for the payment of annuities to retired teachers. By
§ 1 the Board of Education was directed to retire teachers from active service on February 1 and August 1 of
each year according to the following program: In 1926
those seventy-five years of age or over, in 1927 those
seventy-four years of age or over, in 1928 those seventythree years of age or over, in 1929 those seventy-two
years of age or over, and in 1930, and in each year thereafter, those seventy years of age or over. Section 2
provided:
"Each person so retired from active service who served
in the public schools of such city for twenty or more
years prior to such retirement, shall be paid the sum of
fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) annually and for life
from the date of such retirement from the money derived from the general tax levy for educational purposes .
There were two provisos, the one requiring that the
annuitant should be subject to call by the superintendent of schools for consultation and advisory service, and
the other declaring that the annuity granted by the Act
was not to be in lieu of, but in addition to; the retirement allowance payable under existing legislation.
In 1927 a third section was added 5 permitting teachers
who had served for twenty-five years or more, and were
sixty-five years of age or over, who had not reached the
age of compulsory retirement, to be retired upon request
and to be paid from One thousand dollars to Fifteen
hundred dollars per annum depending upon age at
retirement.

DODGE v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.
74

Opinion of the Court.

The appellants fall into three classes: those who were
compulsorily retired under the Miller Law; those who
voluntarily retired under the law as amended; and those
eligible for voluntary retirement who had signified their
election to retire prior to July 1935.
July 12, 1935, a further amendment of the Miller Law
was adopted' requiring the Board presently to retire
teachers then in service who were sixty-five years of age
or over and in the future to retire teachers as they attained that age. Each person so retired was to be paid
Five hundred dollars annually for life from the date of
retirement. The provisions that such teachers should
hold themselves available for advisory service and consultation and that the annuity payments should be in
addition to those made to retired teachers pursuant to
other legislation were retained. Section 3 of the Miller
Law, permitting voluntary retirement between the ages
of sixty-five and seventy, was repealed. As construed by
the State Supreme Court, the new law reduced to $500
the annuities of teachers theretofore retired, or eligible
for retirement under the Miller Law, as well as those to
be retired subsequent to its enactment.
Some of the appellants filed a class bill, in which the
others intervened as co-plaintiffs, alleging that their
rights to annuities were vested rights of which they could
not be deprived; that the Miller Law constituted an offer
which each of them had accepted by remaining in service
until compulsory retirement or by retiring; that the obligation of the contract had thus been perfected and its
attempted impairment by the later enactment was ineffective; and praying that the Board be commanded to
rescind action taken pursuant to the Act of 1935 and enjoined from complying with its provisions. The appellee

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

Board of Education filed an answer in which it denied
the existence of a contract and asserted that the payments to be made to appellants were pensions, subject
to revocation or alteration at the will of the legislature.
The appellee City of Chicago filed a motion to dismiss
for want of equity. After a hearing, at which testimony
was taken on behalf of the appellants, the trial court
dismissed the bill.
The Supreme Court of the State affirmed, holding that,
notwithstanding the payments under the Miller Law are
denominated annuities, they cannot be differentiated
from similar payments directed by law to be made to
other retired civil servants of the State and her municipalities, and are in. fact pensions or gratuities involving
no agreement of the parties and subject to modification
or abolition at the pleasure of the legislature."
The parties agree that a state may enter into contracts
with citizens, the obligation of which the legislature can
not impair by subsequent enactment. They agree that
legislation which merely declares a state policy, and directs a subord'I:nate body to carry it into effect, is subject
to revision or repeal in the discretion of the legislature.
The point of controversy is as to the category into which
the Miller Law falls.
In determining whether a law tenders a contract to a
citizen it is of first importance to examine the language
of the statute. If it provides for the execution of a written contract on behalf of the state the case for an obligation binding upon the state is clear.8 Equally clear
is the case where a statute confirms a settlement of disputed rights and defines its terms.9 On the other hand,
an act merely fixing salaries of officers creates no contract in their favor and the compensation named may

be altered at the will of the legislature." This is true
also of an act fixing the term or tenure of a public officer
or an employe of a state agency." The presumption is
that such a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested -rights but merely declares a policy
to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise. He who asserts the creation of a contract with
the state in such a case has the burden of overcoming
the presumption." If, upon a construction of the statute, it is found that the payments are gratuities, involving no agreement of the parties, the grant of them creates
no vested right.'
The Supreme Court of Illinois concluded that neither
the language of the Miller Law, nor the circumstances of
its adoption, evinced an intent on the part of the legislature to create a binding contract with the teachers of
the State. While we are required to reach an independent judgment as to the existence and nature of the alleged
contract, we give great Weight to the views14of the highest
court of the State touching these matters.
The Miller Law is entitled "An Act to provide for compulsory and voluntary retirement of teachers, . . . and
the payment of retirement annuities." The relevant
words of § 1 are: "In every city in this state . . . the
board of education of such city shall retire from active

Sec-

tion 2 provides: "Each person so retired . . .shall be
paid the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) annually
and for life from the date of such retirement . ...
Section 3 provides that persons sixty-five years of age or
over "shall upon their own request, be retired . . . and
thereafter be paid annuities for life . . . ." Appellants
admit that this is not the normal language of a contract
but rely on the circumstance that they, as teachers, especially those who voluntarily retired when otherwise
they would not have been required so to do, rightly understood the State was pledging its faith that it would
not recede from the offer beld out to them by the statute
as an inducement to become teachers, and to retire and
that the use of the term "annuities" rather than "pensions" was intended as a further assurance of a vested
contractual right. The Supreme Court answered this
contention by referring to the fact that for years prior to
the adoption of the Miller Law, and by a uniform course
of decision, it had held that acts indistinguishable from
the Miller Law, establishing similar benefit systems, did
not create contracts or vested rights and that the State
was free to -alter, amend, and repeal such laws even
though the effect of its action was to deprive the pensioner or annuitant, for the future, of benefits then enjoyed. The cases to which the court refers so decide.1"

Porter v. Loehr, 332 Ill. 353; 163 N. E. 689; and DeWolf v. Bowley,
355 Ill. 530, but these cases did not deal with the question presented
in the instant case, and what was said with respect to the nature
of pensions was in connection with provisions of the State Constitution.

DODGE v. BOARD OF EDUCATION.
74

Opinion of the Court.

The court further held that the legislature presumably
had the doctrine of these cases in mind when it adopted
the act now under review and that the appellants should
have known that no distinction was intended between the
rights conferred on them and those adjudicated under
like laws with respect to other retired civil servants. We
cannot say that this was error.
The appellants urge that the Miller Law, contrary to
most of the acts that preceded it, omitted to use the word
"pension" and instead used the word "annuity," a choice
of terminology based on contract rather than on gift, and
implying a consideration received as well as offered' The
State Supreme Court answered the contention by saying:
"We are unable to see the distinction. The plan of payment is the same, the purposes are evidently the same,
and the use of the term 'annuity' instead of 'pension'which is but an annuity--does not seem to us to result
in the distinction for which counsel for appellants
contend."
We are of the same 6pinion, particularly as an examination of the Illinois statutes indicates that, in acts dealing with the subject, the legislature has apparently used
the terms "pensions," "benefits," and "annuities" interchangeably as having the same connotation.16
The judgment is
Affirmed.
16

In acts creating funds through enforced contributions of state
and municipal employes, or. out of taxes, or both, the titles and the
substantive provisions for benefits to retired employes disclose the
use of the terms "pensions" and "annuities" interchangeably to describe the payments to be made from the fund. Act of May 24,
