WARDEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 25. Argued October 21, 22, 1937.-Decided November 8, 1937.
1. The law has long recognized a relation between punishment for
breach of prison and the offense for which the prisoner is held,
and it has more severely punished prison-breaking by one undergoing imprisonment for grievous crime than if done by one held
for a lesser offense. P. 53.
2. A law of Pennsylvania classifying punishments to be imposed on
convicts breaking out of the penitentiary by authorizing the
court to imprison each for a period not exceeding his original
sentence, held consistent with the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 52.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

302 U. S.

Messrs. William J. Hughes, Jr. and Bernard T. Foley,
with whom Mr. William E. Leahy was on the brief, for
petitioner.
Messrs. Adrian Bonnelly and Burton R. Laub, with
whom Mr. Charles J. Margiotti, Attorney General of
Pennsylvania, and Messrs. Mortimer E. Graham, William
F. Illig, and Samuel Roberts were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether, consistently with the equal protection clause, a State may
classify punishments to be imposed on convicts breaking
out of the penitentiary by authorizing the court to imprison each 'for a period not exceeding his original
sentence.
September 21, 1936, petitioner, asserting that he was
illegally committed to the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania to serve a sentence for the crime of breaking
out of that prison, applied to the highest court of the
State for a writ of habeas corpus. The court granted
a rule to show cause and, after hearing counsel for the
parties, held petitioner lawfully sentenced and discharged
the rule. 325 Pa. St. 305; 188 Atl. 841. The petition
f6r writ of certiorari ksserts that this decision conflicts
with State v. Lewin, 53 Kan. 679; 37 P. 168; In re Mallon, 16 Idaho 737; 102 P. 374; and State v. Johnsey,
46 Okla. Cr. App. 233; 287 P. 729. The statutes condemned in the Kansas and Idaho cases differ essentially
from the Pennsylvania statute upheld in this case. Finding conflict between the decision below and that in the
Oklahoma 6ase, we granted the writ. Judicial Code,
§ 237 (b); 28 U. S. C., § 344 (b).
The challenged provision, found in the Act of March
31, 1860, P. L. 382, declares (§ 3) that "if any prisoner

imprisoned in any penitentiary . . . upon a conviction
for a criminal offense . . . shall break such penitentiary
• . . such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction of said offense, shall be sentenced to
undergo an imprisonment, to commence from the expiration of his original sentence, of the like nature, and
for a period of time not exceeding the original sentence,
by virtue of which he was imprisoned, when he so broke
prison and escaped. .. ."
In 1929, petitioner pleaded guilty of the crimes of
burglary and larceny and was sentenced to the Western
Penitentiary for a term of from three to six years. In
December, 1931, he broke out, and, after capture and
conviction, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of
the same length as, and to commence at the expiration of,
the original sentence.
To illustrate the inequalities between sentences permissible under the challenged provision, petitioner emphasizes the fact that, if two or more convicts escape
together under the same circumstances, they may be sentenced for different terms. In fact, the record shows
that petitioner escaped simultaneously with one McCann
and that upon conviction for the same crime the latter
was sentenced to serve a term equal to his original sentence, from one to two years.
But the fact that terms of imprisonment may differ as
do original sentences does not warrant condemnation of
the statute. The law has long recognized a relation between punishment for breach of prison and the offense
for which the prisoner is held, and it has more severely
punished prison breaking by one undergoing imprisonment. for grievous crime than if done by one held for a
lesser offense. Prior to the statute de frangentibus prisonam of 1 Edw. 11 (1307) every prison breaking by the
offender himself, whatever the crime for which he was
committed, was a felony, punishable by "judgment of life

or member." This severity was mitigated by the statute.
It forbade that judgment unless the breaking was by one
committed for a capital offense.' Breach and escape by
one held for felony continued to be dealt with as felony;
but, if committed by' one confined for an inferior offense,
was punishable as a high misdemeanor by fine and imprisonment.2 In harmony with that idea a number of
States deal with that offense more severely when committed by one imprisoned for a heinous offense or a long
term.8 Indeed, this Court has sustained classification
for punishment of rimes by convicts upon the basis of
the sentences being served at the time. In Finley v.
California,222 U. S. 28, it held that a statute prescribing
the death penalty for the commission by life prisoners
of assaults with intent to kill, lesser punishments being
laid upon other -convicts, was not repugnant to the equal
protection clause.
The principle is similar to that under which punishment of like crimes may be made more severe if committed by ex-convicts. Persistence in crime and failure
"'That none from henceforth that breaketh prison shall have
judgment of life or member for breaking of prison only, except the
cause for which he was taken and imprisoned did require such judgment, if he had been convict thereupon according to the law and
custom of the realm, albeit in times past it hath been used otherwise."

of earlier discipline effectively to deter or reform justify
more drastic treatment. Graham v. West Virginia, 224

Commonwealth, 2 Metc. 413, 415. People v. Sickles, 156
N. Y. 541, 547; 51 N. E. 288. Save as limited by constitutional provisions safeguarding individual rights, a
State may choose means to protect itself and its people
against criminal violation of its laws. The comparative
gravity of criminal offenses and whether their consequences are more or less injurious are matters for its determination. Collins v. Johnston, 237 U. S. 502, 510.
Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126, 135-136.. It may
inflict a deserved penalty merely to vindicate the law or
to deter or to reform the offender or for all of these purposes. For the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular
acts by which the crime was committed and that there
be taken into account the circumstances of the offense
together with the character and propensities of the offender. His past may be taken to indicate his present
purposes and tendencies and significantly to suggest the
period of restraint and the kind of discipline that ought
to be imposed upon him.
Presumably, the sentence being served at the time of
prison breaking was determined upon due consideration
of the pertinent facts. The judgment then pronounced
is good evidence of the convict's natural or acquired bent
of mind, and his attitude toward the law and rights of
others. The fact that he would- and did break. prison
shows him still disposed to evil and determined to remain hostile to society. And that is sufficient to sustain
the classification made by the Pennsylvania statute for
punishment of prison breakers on the basis of their original sentences.

Affirmed.
