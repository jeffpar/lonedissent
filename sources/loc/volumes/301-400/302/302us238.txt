HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. GOWRAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 27.

Argued October 22, 1937.-Decided December 6, 1937.

1. Dividends of preferred stock to common stockholders whereby
they acquire an interest in the corporation essentially different
from that represented by their common stock are income within
the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. P. 241.
2. Although Congress has power to tax such dividends, they are
exempted by § 115 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1928, which declares
that "A stock dividend shall not be subject to tax." P. 241.
3. A common stockholder received a dividend of preferred stock
worth $100 per share and several months later disposed of it to
the corporation for cash at that valuation. Held:
(1) That the whole of the proceeds of the sale were taxable as
income. P. 243.
The computation is under §§ 111 and 113, Revenue Act of 1928,
which provide that the gain from conversion of property into money
shall be computed at the excess of the amount realized over the
"cost" of the property, which in this case was zero.
(2) The stock dividend was not to be likened to gifts and
legacies, as to which there are special provisions of the Act excluding them from gross income and prescribing the basis for computing
gain from later disposition of the property-§§ 113 (a) (2); 22 (b)
(3). P. 243.
(3) Section 115 (f) cannot, in view of its history, be taken as a
declaration of Congressional intent that the value of all stock
dividends shall be immune from tax not only when received but
also when converted into money or other property. P. 244.
(4) The rates applicable were those prescribed for ordinary
income, not the rate for "capital gains" from "property held by
the taxpayer for more than two years." § 101 (c) (8). Id.
If it be assumed that the common stock was held by the taxpayer for more than two years, the fact is immaterial, since the
dividend stock had been held for only three months, and was
income substantially equivalent for income tax purposes to cash
or property, and under § 115 (b) was presumed to have been

made "out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof, and from
the most recently accumulated earnings or profits."
4. The Circuit Court of Appeals may affirm a decision of the Board
of Tax Appeals upon a theory not presented to or considered by
the Board; but acceptance of the new theory may involve granting
the taxpayer an opportunity to establish additional facts. P. 245.

CiRTIORARI, 301 U. S. 676, to review a judgment which
reversed a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 32 B. T.
A. 820, sustaining an income tax assessment.
Assistant Attorney General Jackson argued the cause,
and Solicitor General Reed, Assistant Attorney General
Morris,and Messrs. Sewall Key and Morton K. Rothschild
were on the brief, for petitioner.
Messrs. John C. Altman and A. L. Nash for respondent.
By leave of Court, Mr. Roger S. Baldwin filed a brief as
amicus curiae, in opposition to the petition for a writ of
certiorari.
MR. JuSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The questions for decision concern the taxation as income of a dividend in preferred stock and the proceeds
received on its sale.
On June 29, 1929, the Hamilton Manufacturing Company, a Wisconsin corporation, had outstanding preferred
stock of the par value of $100 a share and common stock
without par value. On that day the directors declared
from the surplus earnings a dividend of $14 a share on
the common stock, payable on July 1, 1929, in preferred
stock at its par value. Gowran, as owner of common
stock, received as his dividend 533 and a fraction shares
of the preferred. On or about October 1, 1929, the company acquired his preferred stock and paid him therefor,

at $100 a share, $53,371.50. In his income tax return
for the year Gowran did not treat this sum as taxable
income, but included $27,262.72 as capital net gain on the
shares received and sold, computing the gain under Articles 58 and 600 of Regulations 74, then in force. The
Commissioner rejected that treatment of the matter;
determined that the $53,371.50 received was income taxable under the Revenue Act of 1928, § 115 (g), 45 Stat.
791, 822, as a stock dividend redeemed;- and assessed a
deficiency of $5,831.67.
The taxpayer sought a redetermination by the Board
of Tax Appeals. A division of the Board concluded, upon
testimony and stipulated facts, that there had been no
cancellation or redemption of the preferred stock so as
to make it a taxable dividend under § 115 (g); that the
transaction by which the company acquired it constituted
a sale. The Commissioner secured a reconsideration of
the case. He then contended that, under the rule declared in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Tillotson
Mfg. Co., 76 F. (2d) 189, the stock dividend was taxable,
because it had resulted in a change of Gowran's proportionate interest in the company. That contention was
sustained by the Board; and, on that ground, it affirmed
the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency. 32
B. T. A. 820.
The taxpayer sought a review by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. The Commissioner again urged that the stock
dividend was taxable; and then, for the first time, contended that, even if it was not taxable, the determination
of the deficiency should be affirmed, because within the
tax year the stock had been sold at its par value and, as
its cost had been zero, the entire proceeds constituted income. The Court of Appeals recognized that, since the
dividends in preferred stock gave to Gowran an interest
different in character from that which his common stock
represented, it was constitutionally taxable under Kosh-

land v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441; but it held that the
dividend could not be taxed as income, since by § 115 (f)
Congress had provided: "A stock dividend shall not be
subject to tax." And it held further that no part of the
proceeds could be taxed as income, since there was no
profit on the sale, it being agreed that the fair market
value of the stock, both at the date of receipt and at the
date of the sale, was $100 a share. 87 F. (2d) 125.
Because of the importance of the questions presented
in the administration of the revenue laws, certiorari was
granted.
First. The Government contends that § 115 (f) should
be read as prohibiting taxation only of those stock dividends which the Constitution does not permit to be taxed;
and that, since by the dividend Gowran acquired an interest in the corporation essentially different from that
theretofore represented by his common stock, the dividend
was taxable. In support of that construction of § 115
(f), it is urged that Congress has in income tax legislation
manifested generally its intention to use, to the full extent, its constitutional power, Helvering v. Stockholms
Bank, 293 U. S. 84, 89; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S.
1, 9; that this Court holds grants of immunity from taxation should always be strictly construed, Pacific Co. v.
Johnson, 285 U. S. 480, 491; and that the only reason
for exempting stock dividends was to comply with the
Constitution.
This preferred stock had substantially the same attributes as that involved in the Koshland case. There the
dividend was of common stock to a preferred stockholder,
it is true; but we are of opinion that under the rule there
declared Congress could have taxed this stock dividend.
Nevertheless, by § 115 (f) it enacted in 1928, as it did
in earlier and later Revenue Acts, that "a siock dividend
shall not be subject to tax." The prohibition is comprehensive. It is so clearly expressed as to leave no room

for construction. It extends to all stock dividends. Such
was the construction consistently given to it by the Treasury Department.' The purpose of Congress when enacting § 115 (f) may have been merely to comply with the
requirement of the Constitution as interpreted in Eisner
v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189; and the comprehensive
language in § 115 (f) may have been adopted in the erroneous belief that under the rule declared in that case no
stock dividend could be taxed. But such facts would not
justify the Court in departing from the unmistakable comI Eisner v. Macomber was decided March 8, 1920. Soon thereafter,
the Treasury Department declared, in a series of Decisions and
Regulations, that no stock dividend was taxable. Treas. Dec. 3052,
3 C. B. 38 (August 4, 1920); Treas. Dec. 3059, 3 C. B. 38 (August
16, 1920); Office Dec. 732, 3 C. B. 39 (October 28, 1920). Office
Dec. 801, 4 C. B. 24 (January 5, 1921) provided: "A stock dividend
paid in true preferred stock is exempt from tax the same as though
the dividend were paid in common stock." Then followed legislation
in the precise form embodied in § 115 (f) of the Revenue Act of
1928. See § 201 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 228;
§ 201 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 255; § 201 (f)
of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 11; § 115 (f) of the Revenue
Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 204; § 115 (f) of the Revenue Act of
1934, 48 Stat. 680, 712. Article 628 of the Regulations in force in
1928 provided: "Stock dividends.-The issuance of its own stock by
a corporation as a dividend to its shareholders does not result in
taxable income to such shareholders, but gain may be derived or loss
sustained by the shareholders from the sale of such stock, The
amount of gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of such stock,
or from the sale of the stock in respect of which it is issued, shall
be determined as provided in Articles 561 and 600."
Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441, was decided May 18, 1936.
On June 22, 1936, Congress, in enacting the Revenue Act of 1936,
provided in § 115 (f): "1. General Rule-A distribution made by a
corporation to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire
its stock shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it
does not constitute income to the shareholder within the meaning of
the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution." 49 Stat. 1648, 1688.
See also § 115 (h).

mand embodied in the statute. Congress declared that
the preferred stock should not be taxed as a-dividend.
Second. The Government contends that, even if § 115
(f) be construed as prohibiting taxation of the preferred
stock dividend, the decision of the Board of Tax App.als
affirming the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency should be sustained, because the gain from sale of
the stock within the year was taxable income and the
entire proceeds must be deemed income, since the stock
had cost Gowran nothing. The Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected that contention. It held that there was no income, because, as stipulated, there was no difference between the value of the stock when received and its value
when sold. The court likened a non-taxable stock dividend to a tax-free gift or legacy and said: "One who receives a tax-free gift and later sells it, in the absence of
statute providing otherwise, is taxed upon the profit arising from the difference in its value at the time he receives
it and the sale price. Similarly one who receives a taxfree bequest, when selling it, is taxed upon the profit arising from any excess of the sale price over its fair market
value at the time of receipt." [p. 128] Compare Taft
v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470.
The cases are not analogous. Unlike earlier legislation,
§ 113 (a) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1928 prescribes specifically the basis for determining the gain on tax-free
gifts and legacies. It provides that: "If the property was
acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, the basis shall
be the same as it would be in the hands of the donor or
the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired
by gift." And the basis foi the computation on property
transmitted at death is provided for in paragraph (5).
But the method of computing the income from the sale
of stock dividends constitutionally taxable is not specifically provided -for. Furthermore, unlike § 22 (b) (3),
excluding from gross income the value of gifts and lega-

cies, § 115 (f) cannot, in view of its history, be taken
as a declaration of Congressional intent that the value of
all stock dividends shall be immune from tax not only
when received but also when converted into money or
other property. Gain on them is, therefore, to be computed as provided in §§ 111 and 113, by the "excess of
the amount realized" over "the cost of such property"
to the taxpayer. As the' cost of the preferred stock to
Gowran was zero, the whole of the proceeds is taxable.
Gowran asserts that if this "basis of zero" theory is
accepted, the proceeds are taxable not as determined by
the Commissioner but as a capital gain at a different rate
and under different regulations. This depends upon
whether the preferred stock received as a dividend was
a "capital asset," defined by § 101 (c) (8) as "property
held by the taxpayer for more than two years." The
record is silent as to when Gowran acquired the common
stock upon which the preferred was issued as a dividend,
but it may be assumed that'he had held it for more than
two years. For that fact is immaterial since the dividend
stock had been held for -only three months. Whether
taxed by Congress or not, it was income, substantially
equivalent for income tax purposes to cash or property,
and under § 115 (b) was presumed to have been made
"out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof, and from
the most, recently accumulated earnings or profits." In
no sense, therefore, can it be said to have been "held" by
Gowran prior to its declaration.2 Since the proceeds
2Article 501 of Regulations 74 states that "if the taxpayer has

held for more than two years stock upon which a stock dividend
has been declared, both the original and dividend shares are considered to be capital assets." But this was based upon the erroneous
premise that stock dividends could not be income, and was part of
an administrative scheme to apportion some of the cost of the original
shares to the stock received by way of dividend. This arrangement
we declared in Koshland v. Helvering, 298 U. S. 441, to be without
statutory authority, and the same must be said of the Regulation
involved here.

HELVERING v. GOWRAN.

were therefore not "capital gains," they were taxable at
the normal and surtax rates applicable to ordinary
income.'
Third. Gowran contends here that the Government
should not have been permitted by the Court of Appeals
to argue. its "basis of zero" theory, because that theory
raised an issue not pleaded, tried, argued or otherwise referred to in the proceedings before the Board. It is true
that the theory was first presented by the Commissioner
in the Court of Appeals. But it does not appear by the
record that objection to the consideration of this theory
was made below. The only objection made there, as disclosed by the opinion, was "that the Board was without
jurisdiction to decide the case upon a point not urged by
the Commissioner.." As to that objection, the court,
after stating that the only questions submitted are those
of law, said: "The Board approved the Commissioner's
assessment, but did so upon a legal theory different from
his. We are of opinion that the Board acted within its
powers. . . . It is immaterial whether the Commissioner
proceeded upon the wrong theory. The burden is upon
the petitioner to show that the assessment is wrong, upon
any prppertheory; otherwise he must fail." [p. 127].
In the review of judicial proceedings the rule is settled
that if the decision below is correct, it must be affirmed,
although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or
gave a wrong reason. Frey & Son v. Cudahy Packing
Co., 256 U. S. 208; United States v. American Ry. Express Co., 265 U. S. 425; United States v. Holt State
Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 56; Lagnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531;

applies also to the review of decisions of the Board of
Tax Appeals. Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U. S. 123, 132133; cf. ,General Utilities & Operating Co. v. Helvering,
296 U. S. 200, 206." The taxpayer sought review of the
Board's decision by the Court of Appeals. The ultimate
question before that court was whether, upon the facts
stipulated, the Board had erred in affirming the Commissioner's determination that the additional taxes were due.
If the Commissioner was right in his determination, the
Board properly affirmed it, even if the reasons which he
had assigned were wrong.' And, likewise, if the Commissioner's determination was right, the Board's affirmance
of it should have been sustained by the Court of Appeals, even if the Board gave a wrong reason for its
action. By this rule the Government was entitled to urge
in the Court of Appeals that on the undisputed facts the
Board's decision was correct because of the "basis of zero"
theory. And since that court rejected the theory, the
Government was entitled to assert its contention here.

opposed to such procedure.
If the Court of Appeals had accepted the theory, it
would have been open to the taxpayer to urge, in view
of the new issue presented, that he should have the opportunity to establish before the Board additional facts
whicl would affect the result.' As we accept the new
theory, leave is granted Gowran to apply to the lower
