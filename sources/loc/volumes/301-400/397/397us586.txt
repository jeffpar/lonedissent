PER CURIAM.

The judgments are affirmed by an equally divided
Court.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

joins, dissenting.
In this case respondents sued petitioner for payments
alleged to be due under a paterit-licensing agreement.
At trial and on appeal petitioner defended primarily on
the ground that its product did not involve any use of
the respondent's patent. Petitioner did not at any time
attack the validity of the patent itself, and apparently
conceded that controlling law prevented it from doing so.
The District Court found that the product did utilize the
patented invention and awarded damages. The Court

of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in an opinion
delivered May 27, 1969, 411 F. 2d 1218.
On June 16, 1969, this Court decided in Lear, Inc. v.
Adkins, 395 U. S. 653, that a patent licensee could attack
the validity of a patent. That case specifically overruled
the patent-licensee estoppel doctrine applied in Automatic Radio Mfg. Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339
U. S. 827 (1950), a doctrine that was the controlling

law at all times in the proceedings below. Petitioner
now seeks to attack the validity of the patent, but respondents argue that since the issue was never raised
below, it cannot now be litigated.
The failure to assert invalidity below cannot, in these
circumstances, be deemed a waiver of that defense. The
Court has recognized that to be effective a waiver must
be "an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of
a known right or privilege," Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S.
458, 464 (1938), and we have frequently allowed-parties
to raise issues for the first time on appeal when there
has been a significant change in the law since the trial.
This principle has most often been applied in proceedings relating to criminal prosecutions,' but it has also
been invoked in purely civil cases.2 The principle has
not been limited to constitutional issues, and the Court
has permitted consideration on appeal of statutory arguments not presented below.' In deciding whether such

new arguments can be considered, we have primarily
considered three factors:' first, whether there has been
a material change in the law; second, whether assertion
of the issue earlier would have been futile; and third,
whether an important public interest is served by allowing consideration of the issue. It is clear to me that
all these criteria are met in this case.
Undoubtedly our decision in Lear was a major change
in the field of patent law. The Court implicitly recognized. this fact by overruling the estoppel holding in
Automatic Radio. It is also clear that the trial court
was satisfied that applicable law precluded the assertion
of invalidity by patent licensees' and thus earlier argument on the point would have been futile. Finally, and
most importantly, an overriding public interest would
be served by allowing petitioner to challenge the validity
of this patent. Last Term. we unanimously held that
"the public's interest in the elimination of specious patents would be significantly prejudiced if the retroactive
effect of [Lear] were limited in any way." Lear, 8upra,
at 674 n. 19. I do not understand how today's decision
can be reconciled with that statement. Although analytically this case may present a question of waiver and
not retroactivity, the public interest that the Court felt
required full retroactivity in Lear is an equally compelling
reason for allowing petitioner's attack now in spite of
the concessions below. I would vacate the judgments
below and remand the case to the District Court for a
determination of the validity of the patent in issue.

of 1934 although his argument before the Board of Tax Appeals
had rested solely on §§ 166 and 167. We did so because of the

intervening decision in Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331 (1940).
