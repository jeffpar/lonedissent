CRAYCROFT v. FERRALL

ET AL.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 718, Misc.

Decided March 30, 1970

Certiorari granted; 408 F. 2d 587, vacated and remanded.

John Caughlan for petitioner.
Solicitor General Griswold for respondents.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted.
Upon consideration of the suggestion of the Solicitor
General and upon an examination of the entire record,
the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded to
that court.
The Solicitor General concedes that the administrative
remedies that the Court of Appeals held should first
be exhausted by the petitioner, have either been exhausted or are nonexistent. The sole remaining question
therefore seems to be whether petitioner's failure to seek
relief in the Court of Military Appeals precludes consideration of petitioner's claims by the federal courts.

While the Solicitor General concedes that resort to that
judicial remedy does not preclude consideration of petitioner's claim by the federal courts, there is a conflict
among the circuits. It is for consideration of that question, or alternatively the merits, that the case is

remanded.
