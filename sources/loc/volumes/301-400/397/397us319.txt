Redrup v. New York, 386

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,

dissenting.

In my view we should not inflexibly deny to each of
the States the power to adopt and enforce its own standards as to obscenity and pornographic materials; States
ought to be free to deal with varying conditions and
problems in this area. I am unwilling to say that Kentucky is without power to bar public showing of this
film; therefore, I would affirm the judgment from which
the appeal is taken.
dissenting.
If this case involved obscenity regulation by the Federal Government, I would unhesitatingly reverse the
conviction, for the reasons stated in my separate opinion
in Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 496 (1957).
Even in light of the much greater flexibility that I have
always thought should be accorded to the States in this
field, see, e. g., my dissenting opinion in Jacobellis v.
Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 203 (1964), suppression of this

particular film presents a borderline question. However,
laying aside my own personal estimate of the film, I
cannot say that Kentucky has exceeded the constitutional speed limit in banning public showing of the
film within its borders, and accordingly I vote to affirm
the judgment below.
