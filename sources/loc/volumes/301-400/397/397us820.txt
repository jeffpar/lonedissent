ROCKEFELLER, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK,
ET AL. v. CATHOLIC MEDICAL CENTER OF
BROOKLYN & QUEENS, INC., DIVISION OF
ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

No. 1379. Decided May 4, 1970
305 F. Supp. 1268, vacated and remanded.

Louis J. Lefkowitz, Attorney General of New York,
Samuel A. Hirshowitz, First Assistant Attorney General,

and George D. Zuckerman and Lloyd G. Milliken, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellants.

James M. Hartman and Richard L. Epstein for
apellees.
PER CURIAM.

The judgment appealed from does not include an
order granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent
injunction and is therefore not appealable to this Court
under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1253. See Goldstein v. Cox, 396

U. S.471.

The judgment of the District Court is vacated

and the case is remanded to that court so that it may
enter a fresh decree from which timely appeal may be
taken to the Court of Appeals. See Stamler v. Willis,
393 U. S.407.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs in

the result.
