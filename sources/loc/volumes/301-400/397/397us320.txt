OCTOBER TERM, 1969
March 23, 1970

397 U.S.

particular film presents a borderline question. However,
laying aside my own personal estimate of the film, I
cannot say that Kentucky has exceeded the constitutional speed limit in banning public showing of the
film within its borders, and accordingly I vote to affirm
the judgment below.
