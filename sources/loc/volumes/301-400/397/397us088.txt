ARKANSAS v. TENNESSEE
ON BILL OF COMPLAINT

No. 33, Orig.

Argued January 19, 1970-

Decided February 25, 1970
The Special Master's Report, recommending that a disputediarea
between Arkansas and Tennessee along the Mississippi River be
declared part of Tennessee, is adopted, and the Master is appointed as Commissioner to have the boundary line surveyed and
submitted to the Court for approval.

Don Langston, Assistant Attorney General of Arkansas,
argued the cause for plaintiff on exceptions to the Report
of the Special Master. With him on the brief was Joe E.
Purcell, Attorney General.
Heard H. Sutton argued the cause for defendant in
support of the Report of the Special Master. With him
on the brief were David Pack, Attorney General of Tennessee, C. Hayes Cooney, Assistant Attorney General,
Harry W. Laughlin, James L. Garthright, Jr., and
J. Martin Regan.
PER CURIAM.

This original action was commenced on October 13,
1967, by the State of Arkansas to settle a boundary dispute with the State of Tennessee. The disputed area
extends six miles laterally along the west (Arkansas
side) bank of the Mississippi River and encompasses
some five thousand acres. This Court's jurisdiction
arises under Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution of the
United States. On January 15, 1968, we appointed, 389
U. S. 1026, Hon. Gunnar H. Nordbye, Senior United
States Judge of the District of Minnesota, as Special
Master to determine the state line in the disputed area

ARKANSAS v. TENNESSEE

Per Curiam

known as Cow Island Bend in the Mississippi River
located between Crittenden County, Arkansas, and
Shelby County, Tennessee. After conducting an evidentiary hearing and viewing the area, the Master filed
his Report with this Court recommending that all of
the disputed area be declared part of the State of Tennessee. We affirm the Master's Report.
The parties agree that the state line is the thalweg,
that is, the steamboat channel of the Mississippi River
as it flows west and southward between these States.
The Master heard evidence and was presented exhibits
and maps which showed that the migration of the Mississippi River northward and west continued until about
1912. At this time an avulsion occurred leaving Tennessee lands on the west or Arkansas side of the new
or avulsive river channel. The Master found that
thereafter, because of the avulsion, the water in the
thalweg became stagnant and erosion and accretion no
longer occurred. At this time the boundary between
Arkansas and Tennessee became fixed in the middle of
the old abandoned channel.
This is a classic example of the situation referred to
in an earlier case between these States, Arkansas v.
Tennessee, 246 U. S. 158, 173, where we said,
"It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute
that where running streams are the boundaries
between States, the same rule applies as between
private proprietors, namely, that when the bed and
channel are changed by the natural and gradual
processes known as erosion and accretion, the
boundary follows the varying course of the stream;
while if the stream from any cause, natural or artificial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new
one, by the process known as an avulsion, the

resulting change of channel works no change of
boundary, which remains in the middle of the old
channel, although no water may be flowing in it,
and irrespective of subsequent changes in the new
channel."
And, again, id., at 175,
"An avulsion has this effect, whether it results
in the drying up of the old channel or not. So
long as that channel remains a running stream, the
boundary marked by it is still subject to be changed
by erosion and accretion; but when the water becomes stagnant, the effect of these processes is at
an end; the boundary then becomes fixed in the
middle of the channel as we have defined it, and
the gradual filling ;up of the bed that ensues is not
to be treated as an accretion to the shores but as
an ultimate effect of the avulsion."
The exceptions of the State of Arkansas are overruled and the Report of the Special Master is adopted.
It is ordered that the Hon. Gunnar H. Nordbye be,
and he is hereby, appointed as Commissioner in this
case with power to engage and supervise a competent
surveyor, or surveyors, to survey the boundary line as
recommended in the Master's Report. The boundary
line determined by such survey shall be submitted to the
Court by the Commissioner and, if approved, shall be
the boundary line between the two States.
The costs of this proceeding shall be .divided equally
between the parties.

No. 33, Orig. Decided February 25, 1970Decree entered February 25, 1970
Opinion reported: Ante, p. 88.

DECREE
1. It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the
boundary line between the States of Arkansas and
Tennessee in the area in controversy shall be fixed in
the middle of the old abandoned Cow Island Bendway
Channel as partially reflected in the 1953 survey of one
R. L. Cooper (Defendant's Exhibit 42, attached to the
decree in Brown v. Brakensiek, in the Chancery Court of
Shelby County, Tennessee), said abandoned channel extending from its upper or up-river end to the lower or
down-river end of Ike Chute as far as that survey goes,
thence downstream in a southerly direction passing down
the middle of a water drain or creek now running between the lower end of Ike Chute and the upper end of
96 Chute, thence continuing downstream in a southerly
direction down the middle of 96 Chute and coming out
of 96 Chute on a continuing straight line to the point
where it joins the present navigation channel of the
Mississippi River, all as indicated by a broken line
marked "State Line" on the annexed reduced copy of
the 1965 aerial photograph of the area in controversy,
Joint Exhibit A, marked Appendix A-I, and also as
reflected' by a broken line marked "State Line" on a
reduced copy of Defendant's Exhibit 39, the 1937 map
of the United States Engineers and hereto annexed as
Appendix A-II.
2. It is ordered that the Hon. Gunnar H. Nordbye
be, and he is hereby, appointed Commissioner in this
case with power to engage and supervise a com-

petent surveyor, or surveyors, to survey the boundary
line as provided in this decree. The boundary line
determined by such survey shall be submitted to the
Court by the Commissioner and, if approved, shall be
the boundary line between the two States.
3. The costs of this proceeding shall be divided equally
between the parties.
