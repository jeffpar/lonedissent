DEFENSE,

ET AL.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 1391, Misc. Decided March 16, 1970
Certiorari granted; 415 F. 2d 760, vacated and remanded.

Solicitor General Griswold for respondents.
PER CURIAM.
The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted.
Upon consideration of the suggestion of the Solicitor
General and upon an examination of the entire record,
the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded to
.that court in order that it may consider whether it
wishes to adhere to its decision in light of the contrary
position now adopted by respondents. If it decides not
to adhere to its former ruling, the Court of Appeals may
then determine whether it would be appropriate to
remand the case to the District Court.
