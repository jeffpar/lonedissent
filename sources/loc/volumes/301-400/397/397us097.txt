YOUNG v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 579, Misc.

Decided February 27, 1970

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.

Solicitor General Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Wilson, Beatrice Rosenberg, and Roger A. Pauley
for the United States.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit with directions to appoint counsel for the petitioner.
If thereafter counsel is unable to present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal, the Court of Appeals would
then be free to dismiss the appeal as legally insubstantial.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE

is of the opinion that the petition

for a writ of certiorari should be denied.
