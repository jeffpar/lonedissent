WILLIAMS ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MARYLAND

No. 131.

Argued December 9, 1969-Decided April 6, 1970

Appellees, Ilarge-family recipients of benefits under the Aid to
Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, brought
this suit to enjoin the application of Maryland's maximum grant
regulation as contravening the Social Security Act of 1935 and
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Under the program, which is jointly financed by the Federal
and State Governments, a State computes the "standard of need"
of eligible family units. Under the Maryland regulation, though
most families are provided aid in accordance with the standard
of need, a ceiling of about $250 per month is imposed on an
AFDC grant regardless of the size of*the family and its actual
need. The District Court held the regulation "invalid on its
face for overreaching" and thus violative of the Equal Protection
Clause. Held:
1. The Maryland regulation is not prohibited by the Social
Security Act. Pp. 476-483.
(a) A State has great latitude in dispensing its available
funds, King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 318-319, and given Maryland's
finite resources available for public welfare demands, it is not
prevented by the Act from sustaining as many families as it can
and providing the largest families with somewhat less than their
ascertained per capita standard of need. Pp. 478-480.
(b) The statutory standard in § 402 (a) (10) of the Act
that aid "shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all
eligible individuals," is not violated by the regulation, which does
not deprive children of the largest, families of aid but reduces
the family grant as a whole, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has approved the Maryland scheme. Pp.
480-482.
(c) In its Social Security Amendments of 1967, Congress
fully recognized that maximum grant regulations are permissible.

Pp. 482-483.

2. The regulation does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Pp. 483-487.
S(a) The concept of overbreadth, though relevant where
First Amendment considerations are involved, is not pertinent
-to state regulation in the social and economic field. Pp. 484-485.
(b) The regulation is rationally supportable and free from
invidious discrimination since it furthers the State's legitimate
interest in encouraging employment and in maintaining an equitable balance between welfare families and the families of the
working poor. Pp. 486-487.

George W. Liebmann, Assistant Attorney General of
Maryland, argued the cause for appellants. With him
on the briefs were Francis B. Burch, Attorney General,
Robert F. Sweeney, Deputy Attorney General, and
J. Michael Mc Williams, Assistant Attorney General.
Joseph A. Matera argued the cause and filed a brief
for appellees.
Thomas C. ,Lynch, Attorney General, and Elizabeth
Palmer, Deputy Attorney General, filed a brief for the
State of California as imicus curiae urging reversal.

Thomas L. Fike for the Legal Aid Society of Alameda
County, and by Carl Rachlin, Anthony B. Ching, Peter
E. Sitkin, and Steven J. Antler for the Center on Social
Welfare Policy and Law et al.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case involves the validity of a method used by
Maryland, in the administration of an aspect of its
public welfare program, to reconcile the demands of its
needy citizens with the finite resources available to meet
those demands. Like every other State in the Union,
Maryland particip.,tes in the Federal Aid to Families

Opinion of the Court

With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, 42 U. S. C.
§ 601 et seq. (1964 ed. and Supp. IV), which originated
with the Social Security Act of 1935.1 Under this
jointly financed program, a State computes the so-called
"standard of need" of each eligible family unit within
its borders. See generally Rosado v. Wyman, ante,
p. 397. Some States provide that every family shall
receive grants sufficient to meet fully the determined
standard of need. Other States piovide that each family
unit shall receive a percentage of the determined need.
Still others provide grants to most families in full accord
with the ascertained standard of need, but impose an
upper limit on the total amount of money any one
family unit may receive. Maryland, through administrative adoption of a "maximum grant regulation," has
followed this last course. This suit was brought by
several AFDC recipients to enjoin the application of
the Maryland maximum grant regulation on the ground
that it is in conflict with the Social Security Act of 1935
and with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. A three-judge District Court convened
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2281, held that the Maryland
regulation violates the Equal Protection Clause. 297
F. Supp. 450. This direct appeal followed, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253, and we noted probable jurisdiction, 396 U. S. 811.
The operation of the Maryland welfare system is not
complex. By statute 2 the State participates in the
AFDC program. It computes the standard of need for
each eligible family based on the number of children in
the family and the circumstances under which the family
lives. In general, the standard of need increases with
each additional person in the household, but the incre149 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §§ 301-1394 (1964 ed.

The regulation now provides:
"B. Amount-The amount of the grant is the resulting amount of
need when resources are deducted from requirements as set forth
in this Rule, subject to a maximum on each grant from each
category:
"1. $250-for local departments under any 'Plan A' of Shelter
Schedule
"2. $240-for local departments under any 'Plan B' of Shelter
Schedule
"Except that:
"a. If the requirements of a child over 18 are included to enable
him to complete high school or training for employment (III-C-3),
the grant may exceed the maximum by the amount of such child's
needs.
"b. If the resource of support is paid as a refund (VI-B-6), the
grant may exceed the maximum by an amount of such refund. This
makes consistent the principle that the amount from public assistance
funds does not exceed the maximum.
"c. The maximum may be exceeded by the amount of an emergency grant for items not included in a regular monthly grant. (VIII)
"d. The maximum may be exceeded up to the amount of a grant
to a person in one of the nursing homes specified in Schedule D,
Section a.
"3. A grant is subject to any limitation established because of
insufficient funds."

In addition, AFDC recipients in Maryland may be eligible for
certain assistance i3 kind, including food stamps, public housing,
and medical aid. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. § 1396 et seq. (1964 ed.,

state and federal law also permit recipients to keep part of their

have large families, so that their standards of need as
computed by the State substantially exceed the maximum
grants that they actually receive under the regulation.
The appellees urged in the District Court that the maximum grant limitation operates to discriminate against
them merely because of the size of their families, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. They claimed further that the regulation
is incompatible with the purpose of the Social Security
Act of 1935, as well as in conflict with its explicit
provisions.
In its original opinion the District Court held that
the Maryland regulation does conflict with the federal
statute, and also concluded that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. After
reconsideration on motion, the court issued a new opinion
resting its determination of the regulation's invalidity
entirely on the constitutional ground.' Both the statutory and constitutional issues have been fully briefed
and argued here, and the judgment of the District Court
must, of course, be affirmed if the Maryland regulation
is in conflict with either the federal statute or the Constitution.' We consider the statutory question first, beearnings from outside jobs. 42 U. S. C. §§ 630-644 (1964 ed.,
Supp. IV); Md. Manual of Dept. of Social Services, Rule 200,
§ VI, B (8) (c) (2)*. Both federal and state law require that recipients seek work and take it if it is available. 42 U. S. C.
§602 (a)(19)(F) (1964 ed., Supp. IV); Md. Manual of Dept. of
Social Services, Rule 200, § III (D) (1) (d).
Both opinions appear at 297 F. Supp. 450.
The prevailing party may, of course, assert in a reviewing court
any ground in support of his judgment, whether or not that ground
was relied upon or even considered by the trial court. Compare

there is no occasion to reach the constitutional issues.

I
The appellees contend that the maximum grant system
is contrary to § 402 (a) (10) of the Social Security Act,
as amended,' which requires that a state plan shall
"provide . . . that all individuals wishing to make
application for aid to families with dependent
children shall have opportunity to do so, and
that aid to families with dependent children shall
be furnished with reasonable promptness to all
eligible individuals."
The argument is that the state regulation denies benefits

to the younger children in a large family. Thus, the
appellees say, the regulation is in patent violation of the
Act, since those younger children are just as "dependent"
taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack
upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter
overlooked or ignored by it. By the claims now in question, the
American does not attack, in any respect, the decree entered below.
It merely asserts additional grounds why the decree should be
affirmed." When attention has been focused on other issues, or
when the court from which a case comes has expressed no views
on a controlling question, it may be appropriate to remand the
case rather than deal with the merits of that question in this Court.
See Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Flowers, 330 U. S. 464, 468; United
States v. Ballard, 322 U. S.78, 88. That is not the situation here,
however. The issue having been fully argued both here and in the
District Court, consideration of the statutory claim is appropriate.

Opinion of the Court

as their older siblings under the definition of "dependent
child" fixed by federal law.' See King v. Smith, 392
U. S. 309. Moreover, it is argued that the regulation, in
limiting the amount of money any single household may
receive, contravenes a basic purpose of the federal law
by encouraging the parents of large families to "farm
out" their children to relatives whose grants are not yet
subject to the maximum limitation.
It cannot be gainsaid that the effect of the Maryland'
maximum grant provision is to reduce the per capita

benefits to the children in the largest families.

Although

the appellees argue that the younger and more recently

arrived children in such families are totally deprived of
aid, a more realistic view is that the lot of the entire

family is diminished because of the presence of additional
Cf. King v.
Smith, supra, at 335 n. 4 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring). It
is no more accurate to say that the last child's grant is
wholly taken away than to say that the grant of the first
child is totally rescinded. In fact,, it is the family grant

-children without any increase in payments.

8 42 U. S. C. § 606 (a) (1964 ed., Supp. IV) provides:
"The term 'dependent child' means a needy child (1) who has been
deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a
parent, and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather,
grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother,
stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece, in a place of
residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or
their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age. of eighteen, or
(B) under the age of twenty-one and (as determined by the State
in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) a student
regularly attending a school, college, or university, or regularly
attending a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit
him for gainful employment."
The Act also covers children who have been placed in foster homes
pursuant to judicial order or because they are state charges. 42
U. S. C. § 608 (1964 ed., Supp: IV).

OCTOBER TERM. 1969

that is affected. Whether this per capita diminution is
compatible with the statute is the question here. For
the reasons that follow, we have concluded that the
Maryland regulation is permissible under the federal law.
In King v. Smith, supra, we stressed the States' "undisputed power," under these provisions of the Social
Security Act, "to set the level of benefits and the standard of need." Id., at 334. We described the AFDC
enterprise as "a scheme of cooperative federalism," id., at
316, and noted carefully that "[t]here is no question
that States have considerable latitude in allocating their
AFDC resources, since each State is free to set its own
standard of need and to determine the level of benefits
by the amount of funds it devotes to the program." Id.,
at 318-319.
Congress was itself cognizant of the limitations on
state resources from the very outset of the federal welfare
program. The first section of the Act, 42 U. S. C. § 601
(1964 ed., Supp. IV), provides that the Act is
"For the purpose of encouraging the care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes
of relatives by enabling each State to furnish
financial assistance and rehabilitation and other
services, as far as practicable under the conditions
in such State, to needy dependent children and the
parents or relatives with whom they are living to
help maintain and strengthen family life and to help
such parents or relatives to attain or retain capability for the maximum self-support and personal independence consistent with the maintenance of
"
continuing parental care and protection ...
(Emphasis added.)
Thus the starting point of the statutory analysis must
be a recognition that the federal law gives each State
great latitude in dispensing its available funds.

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS
471

Opinion of the Court

The very title of the program, the repeated references
to families added in 1962, Pub. L. 87-543, § 104 (a)(3),
76 Stat. 185, and the words of the preamble quoted dbove,
show that Congress wished to help children through the
family structure. The operation of the statute itself has
this effect. From its inception the Act has defined "dependent child" in part by reference to the relatives with
whom the child lives.' When a "dependent child" is
living with relatives, then "aid" also includes payments
and medical care to those relatives, including the spouse
of the child's parent. 42 U. S. C. § 606 (b) (1964 ed.,
Supp. IV). Thus, as the District Court noted, the
amount of aid "is . . . computed by treating the relative, parent or spouse*of parent, as the case may be, of
the 'dependent child' as a part of the family unit." 297
F. Supp., at 455. Congress has been so desirous of keeping dependent children within a family that in the Social
Security Amendments of 1967 it provided that aid could
go to children whose need arose merely from their
parents' unemployment, under federally determined
standards, although the parent was not incapacitated.
42 U. S. C. § 607 (1964 ed., Supp. IV).
The States must respond to this federal statutory concern for preserving children in a family environment.
Given Maryland's finite resources, its choice is either to
suppo'rt some families adequately and others less adequately, or not to give sufficient support to any family.
We see nothing in the federal statute that forbids a
State to balance the stresses that uniform insufficiency
of payments would impose on all families against the
greater ability of large families-because of the inherent
942 U. S. C. § 606 (a) (1964 ed., Supp. IV), supra, n. 8, formerly

economies of scale-to accommodate their needs to
diminished, per capita payments. The strong policy
of the statute in favor of preserving family units does
not prevent a State from sustaining as many families
as it can, and providing the largest families somewhat
less than their ascertained per capita standard of need."°
Nor does the maximum grant system necessitate the
dissolution of family bonds. For even if a parent should
be inclined to increase his per capita family income by
sending a child away, the federal law requires that the
child, to be eligible for AFDC payments, must live with
one of several enumerated relatives.1 The kinship tie
may be attenuated but it cannot be destroyed.
The appellees rely most heavily upon the statutory
requirement that aid "shall be furnished with reasonable
promptness to all eligible individuals." 42' U. S. C.
§ 602 (a)(10) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). But since the statute
leaves the level of benefits within the judgment of the
State, this language cannot mean that the "aid" furnished
must equal the total of each individual's standard of need
in every family group. Indeed the appellees do not deny
that a scheme of proportional reductions for all families
could be used that would result in no individual's receiving aid equal to his standard of need. As we have
'0 The Maryland Dept. of Social Services, Monthly Financial and
Statistical Report, Table 7 (Nov. 1969), indicates that 32,504 families receive AFDC assistance. In the Maryland Dept. of Social
Services, 1970 Fiscal Year Budget, the department estimated that
2,537 families would be affected by the removal of the maximum
grant limitation. It thus appears that only one-thirteenth of the
AFDC families in Maryland receive less than their determined need
because of the operation of the maximum grant regulation. Of
course, if the same funds were allocated subject to a percentage
limitation, no AFDC family would receive funds sufficient to meet
its determined need.

Opinion of the Court

noted, the practical effect of the Maryland regulation is
that all children, even in very large families, do receive
some aid. We find nothing in 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(10)
(1964 ed., Supp. IV) that requires more than this.12 So
long as some aid is provided to all eligible families and
all eligible children, the statute itself is not violated.
This is the view that has been taken by the Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), who is
charged with the administration of the Social Security
Act and the approval of state welfare plans. The parties
have stipulated that the Secretary has, on numerous
occasions, approved the Maryland welfare scheme, including its provision of maximum payments to any one
family, a provision that has been in force in various
forms since 1947. Moreover, a majority of the States
pay less than their determined standard of need, and 20
of these States impose maximums on family grants of
the kind here in issue.1 The Secretary has not disapproved any state plan because of its maximum grant

grants; rather than all the family members whom the applicants
may represent, and that the statutory provision was designed only
to prevent the use of waiting lists.. There is considerable support

in the legislative history for this view. See H. R. Rep. No. 1300,
81st Cong., 1st Sess., 48, 148 (1949); 95 Cong. Rec. 13934 (1949)
(remarks of Rep. Forand). And it is certainly true that the
statute contemplates that actual payments will be made to responsible adults. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. § 605. For the reasons given
above, however, we do not find it necessary to consider this
argument.
12 See HEW Report on Money Payments to Recipients of Special
Types of Public Assistance, Oct. 1967, Table 4 (NCSS Report
D-4). See also Hearings on H. R. 5710 before the House Coinmittee on Ways and Means, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 118

provision. On the contrary, the Secretary has explicitly
recognized state maximum grant systems.'
Finally, Congress itself has acknowledged a full awareness of state maximum grant limitations. In the Amendments of 1967 Congress added to § 402 (a) a subsection,
23:
"[The State shall] provide that by July 1, 1969, the
amounts used by the State to determine the needs
of individuals will have been adjusted to reflect fully
changes in living costs since such amounts were
established, and any maximums that the State imposes on the amount of aid paid to families will
have been proportionately adjusted." 81 Stat. 898,
42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(23) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).
(Emphasis added.)
This specific congressional recognition of the state maximum grant provisions is not, of course, an approval of
any specific maximum. The structure of specific maximums Congress left to the States, and the validity of any
such structure must meet constitutional tests. However, the above amendment does make clear that Con14 HEW, State Maximums and Other Methods of Limiting Money
Payments to Recipients of Special Types of Public Assistance,
Oct. 1962, p. 3:
"When States are unable to meet need as determined under their
standards they reduce payments on a percentage or flat reduction

basis .

. ...

These types of limitations may be used in the absence

of, or in conjunction with, legal or administrative maximums. A
maximum limits the amount of assistance that may be paid to
persons whose determined, need exceeds that maximum, whereas
percentage or flat reductions usually have the effect of loweripg
payments to most or all recipients to a level below that of determined need."

gress fully recognized that the Act permits maximum
grant regulations."5
For all of these reasons, we conclude that the Maryland
regulation is not prohibited by the Social Security Act.
II
Although a State may adopt a maximum grant system
in allocating its funds available for AFDC payments
without violating the Act, it may not, of course, impose
a regime of invidious discrimination in violation of the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Maryland says that its maximum grant regulation is
wholly free of any invidiously discriminatory purpose
or effect, and .that the regulation is rationally supportable on at least four entirely valid grounds. The regulation can be clearly justified, Maryland argues, in terms
of legitimate state interests in encouraging gainful employment, in maintaining an equitable balance in economic status as between welfare families and those sup15

- The provisions of 42 U. S. C. § 1396b (f) (1964 ed., Supp.
IV), also added by the Amendments of 1967, 81 Stat. 898, are
consistent with this view. That section provides that no medical
assistahce shall be given to any family that has a certain level of
income. The section, however, makes an exception, 42 U. S. C.
§ 1396b (f) (1) (B) (ii) (1964 ed., Supp. IV):
"If the Secretary finds that the operation of a uniform maximum
limits payments to families of more than one size, he may adjust
the amount otherwise determined under clause (i) to take account
of families of different sizes."
These provisions have particular significance in light of the.Administration's initial effort to secure a law forcing each State to pay
itsfull standard of need. See Rosado v. Wyman, supra.
This recognition of the existence of state maximums is not new
with the Amendments of 1967. In reporting on amendments to
the Social Security Act in 1962, 76 Stat. 185, the Senate committee
referred to "States in which, there is a maximum limiting the
amount of assistance an individual may receive." S. Rep. No. 1589,

ported by a wage-earner, in providing incentives for
family. planning, and in allocating available public funds
in such a way as fully to meet the needs of the largest
possible number of families. The District Court, while
apparently recognizing the validity of at least some of
these state concerns, nonetheless held that the regulation "is invalid on its face for overreaching," 297 F. Supp.,
at 468-that it violates the Equal Protection Clause
"[b]ecause it cuts too broad a swath on an indiscriminate
basis as applied to the entire group of AFDC eligibles
to which it purports to apply ....
" 297 F. Supp., at
469.
If this were a case involving government action claimed
to violate the First Amendment guarantee of free speech,
a finding of "overreaching" would be significant and
might be crucial. For, when otherwise valid governmental regulation sweeps so broadly as to impinge upon
activity protected by the First Amendment, its very
overbreadth may make it unconstitutional. See, e. g.,
Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479. But the concept of
"overreaching" has no place in this case. For here we
deal with state regulation in the social and economic field,
not affecting freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights,
and claimed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment only
because the regulation results in some disparity in grants
of welfare payments to the largest AFDC families.16 For
this Court to approve the invalidation of .state economic
or social regulation as "overreaching" would be far too
reminiscent of an era when the Court thought the Fourteenth Amendment gave it power to strike down state
laws "because they may be unwise, improvident, or out
of harmony with a particular school of thought." Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488. That

In the area of economics and social welfare, a State
does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely
because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.

in practice it results in some inequality." Lindsley v.

To be sure, the cases cited, and many others enunciating this fundamental standard under the Equal Protection Clause, have in the main involved state regulation
of business or industry. The administration of public
welfare assistance, by contrast, involves the most basic
economic needs of impoverished human beings. We recognize the dramatically real factual difference between
the cited cases and this one, but we can find no basis for
applying a different constitutional standard. 17 See Snell
v. Wyman, 281 F. Supp. 853, aff'd, 393 U. S. 323. It is
a standard that has consistently been applied to state
legislation restricting the availability of employment

economic or social policy."
Under this long-established meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, it is clear that the Maryland maximum
grant regulation is constitutionally valid. We need not
explore all the reasons that the State advances in juqtification of the regulation. It is enough that a solid foundation for the regulation can be found in the State's
legitimate interest in encouraging empl6yment and in
avoiding discrimination between welfare families and the
families of the working poor. By combining a limit on
the recipient's grant with permission to retain money
earned, without reduction in the amount of the grant,
Maryland provides an incentive to seek gainful employment. And by keying the maximum family AFDC
grants to the minimum wage a steadily employed head
of a household receives, the State maintains some semblance of an equitable balance between families on welfare and those supported by an employed breadwinner."'
It is true that in some AFDC families there may be
no person who is employable. 0 It is also true that with
respect to AFDC families whose determined standard
of need is below the regulatory maximum, and who therefore receive grants equal to the determined standard,
the employment incentive is absent. But the Equal
Protection Clause does not require that a State must

We do not decide today that the Maryland regulation
is wise, that it best fulfills the relevant social and economic objectives that Maryland might ideally espouse,
or that a more just and humane system could not be
devised. Conflicting claims of morality and intelligence
are raised by opponents and proponents of almost every
measure, certainly including the one before us. But the

THE CHIEF JUSTICE

joins, concurring.
Assuming, as the Court apparently does, that individual welfare recipients can bring an action against state
welfare authorities challenging an aspect of the State's
welfare plan as inconsistent with the, provisions of the
Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. §§ 601-610 (1964 ed. and
Supp. IV), even though the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has determined as he has here that
the federal and- state provisions are consistent, cf. Rosado
v. Wyman, ante, p. 430 (BLACK, J., dissenting), I join
in the opinion of the Court in this case.
MR. JUSTICE HIALN, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion, with one reservation which
I deem called for by certain implications that might be
drawn from the opinion.
As I stated in dissent in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U. S. 618, 658-663 (1969), I find no solid basis for the
doctrine there expounded that certain statutory classifications will be held to deny equal protection unless
justified by a "compelling" governmental interest,
while others will pass muster if they meet traditional
equal protection standards. See also my dissenting
opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641,
660-661 (1966). Except with respect to racial classifications, to which unique historical considerations
apply, see Shapiro, at 659, I believe the constitutional
provisions assuring equal protection of the laws impose
a standard of rationality of classification, long applied
in the decisions of this Court, that does not depend upon
the nature of the classification or interest involved.

It is on this basis, and not because this case involves

holding.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.

Appellees, recipients of benefits under the Aid to
Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program,
brought this suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 to have declared invalid and permanently enjoined the enforcement
of the Maryland maximum grant regulation, which places
a ceiling on the amount of benefits payable to a family
under AFDC. They alleged that the regulation was inconsistent with the Social Security Act and that it denied
equa 1 .:-*--tion of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. I do not find it necessary to reach
the constitutional argument in this case, for in my view
the Maryland regulation is inconsistent with the terms
and purposes of the Social Security Act.
The Maryland regulation under attack, Rule 200, § X,
B, of the Maryland Department of Social Services, places
an absolute limit of $250 per month on the amount of
a grant under AFDC, regardless of the size of the family
and its actual need., The effect of this regulation is to
deny benefits to additional children born into a family
of six, thus making it impossible for families of seven
persons or more to receive an amount commensurate with
their actual need in accordance with standards formufated by the Maryland Department of Social Services,
whereas families of six or less can receive the full amount
of their need as so determined. Appellee Williams, according to the computed need for herself and her eight
I In certain counties the applicable maximum grant is $240 per
month. All of the appellees in this case are residents of Baltimore
City, where the $250-per-month maximum grant applies.

children, should receive $296.15 per month. Appellees
Gary should receive $331.50 for themselves and their
eight children.. Instead, these appellees received the $250
maximum grant.
In King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 318-319, this Court
stated: "There is no question that States have considerable latitude in allocating their AFDC resources, since
each State is free to set its own standard of need and to
determine the level of benefits by the amount of funds it
devotes to the program." That dictum, made in the context of a case that dealt with Alabama's "substitute
father" regulation, does little to clarify the limits of state
authority. The holding in King was that the Alabama
regulation, which denied AFDC benefits to the children
of a mother who "cohabited" in or outside her home with
an able-bodied man, was invalid because it defined
"parent" in a manner inconsistent with § 406 (a) of the
Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. § 606 (a) (1964 ed., Supp.
IV). The Court rejected the State's contention that its
regulation was "a legitimate way of allocating its limited
resources available for AFDC assistance." 392 U. S., at
318. Thus, whatever else may be said of the "latitude"
extended to States in determining the benefits payable
under AFDC, the holding in King makes clear that it
does not include restrictions on the payment of benefits
that are incompatible with the Social Security Act.
The methods by which a State can limit AFDC payments below the level of need are numerous. The
method used in King was to deny totally benefits to a
specifically defined class of otherwise eligible recipients.
Another. method, which was disapproved by Congress in
§402 (a) (10) of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C.
. 602 (a)(10) (1964 ed., Supp. IV), was to refuse to take
additional applications pending a decrease in the number
of recipients on the assistance rolls or an increase in
available funds. The two methods most commonly em-

OCTOBER TERM, 1969

ployed by the States at present, however, are percentage
reductions and grant maximums. See Department of
Health., Education, and Welfare (HEW), State Maximums and Other Methods of Limiting Money Payments
to Recipients of the Special Types of Public Assistance,
Oct. 1968, Tables 2, 3 (NCSS Report D-3). Grant maximums, in which payments are made according to need
but subject to a stated dollar maximum, are of two types:
individual maximums and family maximums. Only the
latter type is at issue in the present case. Percentage
reductions involve payments of a fixed percentage of
actual need as determined by the State's need standard.
The authority given the States to set the level of
benefits payable under their AFDC plans stems from
§ 401 of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. § 601 (1964
ed., Supp. IV), which states the purpose of the federal
AFDC appropriations as "enabling each State'to furnish
financial assistance and rehabilitation and other services,
as far as practicable under the conditions in such
State . . . ." (Emphasis added.) It is significant in this
respect that the Court in King referred only to a State's
determination of the level of benefits "by the amount of
funds it devotes to the [AFDC] program." 392 U. S.,
at 318-319 (emphasis added). The language of § 401
and the language of the Court in King both reflect a concern that the Federal Government not require a state
legislature to appropriate more money for welfare purposes than it is willing and able to appropriate. The
use of the matching formula in § 403 of the Act, 42
U. S. C. § 603 (1964 ed., Supp. IV), supports this deference to the fiscal decisions of state legislatures. The
question of a State's authority to pay less than its
standard of need, however, has never been expressly
decided.
Assuming, arguendo, that a State need not appropriate
sufficient funds to pay all eligible AFDC recipients the

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS
471

DOUGLAS,

493

J., dissenting

full amount of their need, it does not follow that it can
distribute such funds as it deems appropriate in a manner
inconsistent with the Social Security Act. The question
involved here is not one of ends; it is one of means.
Thus the United States Government, in its Memorandum
as Amicus Curiae in Rosado v. Wyman, decided this day,
ante, p. 397, stated, at 6-7:
"Maximums, whether so many dollars per individual or a total number of dollars per family,-have
an arbitrary aspect lacking from ratable reductions,
since their application means that one family or
individual will receive a smaller proportion of the
amounts he is determined to need under the state's
test than another family or individual. Where percentage reductions are used, the payment of every
family is reduced proportionately . . . . [T]his
aspect explains why Congress might wish to distinguish between maximums and ratable reductions
as a means of reducing a state's financial obligation
and, at least inferentially, to disfavor the former."
The District Court, in its initial ruling that the
Maryland regulation was inconsistent with the Social
Security Act, relied primarily on § 402 (a) (10) of the
Act, which provides that "all individuals wishing to
make application for aid to families with dependent
children shall have opportunity to do so, and that aid
to [families with] dependent children shall be furnished
with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals."
42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(10) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). (Emphasis added.) This provision was added by the Social
Security Act Amendments of 1950, 64 Stat. 549. The
House Committee on Ways and Means, where the provision originated, explained its purpose as follows:
"Shortage of funds in aid to dependent children
has sometimes, as in old-age assistance, resulted in

.

[T]his difference

in treatment accorded to eligible people results in
undue hardship on needy persons and is inappropriate in a program financed from Federal funds."
H. R. Rep. No. 1300, 8.1st Cong., 1st Sess., 48 (1949).
In the court below, the appellants relied upon this
legislative history to argue that the "eligible individuals" to whom aid must be furnished are the applicants
for aid referred to in the beginning of -the provision, and
not the individual members of a family unit. I find
nothing in the Act or in the legislative history of § 402
(a) (10) which supports that argument.
The purpose of the AFDC program, as stated in the
Act, is to encourage "the care of dependent children in
their own homes or in the homes of relatives by enabling
each State to furnish financial assistance and rehabilitation and other services, as far as practicable under the
conditions in such State, to needy dependent children
and the parents or relatives with whom they are living
to help maintain and strengthen family life . .. .

Social Security Act § 401, 42 U. S. C. § 601 (1964 ed.,
Supp. IV) (emphasis added). The terms "dependent
child" and "relative with whom any dependent child is
living" are defined in . 406 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. § 606
(1964 ed., Supp. IV).
The aid provided through the AFDC program has
always been intended for the individual dependent children, not for those who apply for the aid on their behalf.
The Senate Committee on Finance, in its report on the
Social Security Bill of 1935, stated this purpose in the
following terms:
"The heart of any program for social security
must be the child. All parts of the Social Security

Act are in a very real sense measures for the security
of children ...
"In addition, however, there is great need for
special safeguards for many underprivileged children. Children are in many respects the worst
victims of the depression ...
"Many of the children included in relief families
present no other problem than that of providing
work for the breadwinner of the family. These
children-will be benefited through the work relief
program and still more through the revival of private industry. But there are large numbers of
children in relief families which will not be benefited through work programs or the revival of
industry.
"These are the children in families which have
been deprived of a father's support and in which
there is no other adult than one who is needed for
the care of the children ...
"With no income coming.in, and with young children for whom provision must be made for a number of years, families without a father's support

with adequate means or are aided by friends and
relatives. .

.

. Through cash grants adjusted to the

needs of the family it is possible to keep the young
children with their mother in their own home, thus
preventing the necessity of placing the children in
institutions. This is recognized by everyone to be
the least expensive and altogether the most desirable method for meeting the needs of these families
that has yet been devised." S. Rep. No. 628, 74th
Cong., 1st Sess., 16-17 (1935) (emphasis. added).
Prior to 1950, no specific provision was made for the
need of the parent or other relative with whom the
dependent child was living. Although this underscores

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

397 U. S.

the fact that the payments were intended to benefit the
children and not the applicants who received those payments, the exclusion from the federal scheme of
provision for the need of the caring relative operated
effectively to dilute the ability of the AFDC payments
to meet the need of the child. To correct this latter
deficiency, the 1950 Amendments allowed provision for
the needs of this caring relative. The Report of the
House Committee on Ways and Means stated:
"Particularly in families with small children, it
is necessary for the mother or another adult to be
in the home full time to provide proper care and
supervision. Since the person caring for the child
must have food, clothing, and other essentials,
amounts allotted to the children must be used in
part for this purpose if no other provision is made
to meet her needs ...
"To correct the present anomalous situation
wherein no provision is made for the adult relative
and to enable States to make payments that are
more nearly adequate, the' bill would include the
relative with whom the dependent child is living
as a recipient for Federal matching purposes. . "
H. R. Rep. No. 1300, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 46 (1949).
This amendment emphasizes the congressional concern
with fully meeting the needs of the dependent children
in a given family; and it would seem to negative the
necessity of those children sharing their individual allocations with other essential members of the family unit.
There is other evidence that Congress intended each
eligible recipient to receive his fair share, of benefits
under the AFDC program. The Public Welfare Amendments of .1962 provided that a state AFDC plan must
"provide for the development and application of a pro-

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

gram for [services to maintain and strengthen family
life] for each child who receives aid to families with
dependent children . . . ." 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(13).
The Social Security Amendments of 1967, which extended
this progran of "family services" to relatives receiving
AFDC payments and "essential persons" living in the
same home as the child and relative, retained the em.phasis on providing these services to "each appropriate
individual." Social Security Act, §§ 402 (a)(14), (15),
42 U. S. C. §§ 602 (a)(14), (15) (1964 ed., Supp. IV),
The Senate Finance Committee Report on the 1W67
Amendments stated:
"Under the Social Security Act Amendments of
1962, an amendment was added to title IV requiring
the State welfare agency to make a program for
each child, identifying the services needed, and then
to provide the necessary services. This has proven
a useful amendment, for it has required the States
to give attention to the children and to provide
services necessary to carry' out the plans for the
individual child. . . . [T]he committee believes
that it is essential to broaden the requirement for
the program of services for each child to include
the entire family. The committee bill would require, therefore, that the States establish a social
services program for each AFDC family. Thus
there will be a broadened emphasis to include a
recognition of the needs of all members of the family,
including 'essential persons.'"
S. Rep. No. 744,
90th Cong., 1st Sess., 155 (1967).
These "family services" provisions are helpful in interpreting the words "all eligible individuals'! in § 402
(a)(10) of the Act for they reveal, Congress' overriding
concern with meeting the needs of each eligible recipient
of aid under the AFDC program. The resources com-

498

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
DOUGLAS,

397 U. S.

manded to meet those needs, as well as the definition
of those individuals eligible to receive this aid, have expanded over the years. At first, only financial assistance was available. Now "family services" programs
have been added." In each case, however, the concern
has been with meeting the needs of each eligible recipient.
2The benefits distributed under the AFDC program include
"finaficial assistance and rehabilitation and other services." Social
Security Act § 401. The term "aid to families with dependent.
children" is itself defined in § 406 (b) of the Act, as "money pay-

ments with respect to, or .

.

. medical care in behalf of or any type

of remedial care recognized under State law" in behalf of dependent children, the relatives with whom they live, and other "essential
persons" residing with the relative and child.
The services provided by the Act for AFDC recipients include
"family services" and "child-welfare services." "Family services"
are defined by § 406 (d) of the Act, as "services to a family or any
member thereof for the purpose .of preserving, rehabilitating,
reuniting, or strengthening the family, and such other services as
will assist members of a family to attain or retain capability for
the maximum self-support and personal independence.'" "Childwelfare programs" are defined by § 425 of the Act., 42 U. S. C.
§ 625 (1964 ed., Supp. IV), as "public social services which.suppleinent, or substitute for, parental care and supervision for the purpose of (1) preventing or remedying, or assisting in the solution of
problems which may result in, the neglect, abuse, exploitation, or delinquency of children, (2) protecting and caring for homeless,
dependent, or neglected children, (3) protecting and promoting the
welfare of children of working mothers, and (4) otherwise protecting and promoting the welfare of children, including the strengthening of their own homes where possible or, where needed, the provision of adequate care of children away from their homes in foster
family homes or day-care or other child-care facilities." In addition, § 402 (a) (15) of the Act requires the State AFDC plan
to provide for the development of a program for each appropriate relative and dependent child receiving aid under the plan,
and other "essential persons" living with a relative and child
receiving such aid, "with the objective of-(i) assuring, to the
maximum extent possible, that such relative, child, and individual
will enter the labor force and accept employment so that they
will become self-sufficient, and (ii) preventing or reducing the

DouGLAs, J., dissenting

A further indication that the phrase "all eligible individuals" as used in § 402 (a) (10) refers to the individual beneficiaries of aid, and not those who apply
for and receive the payments, lies in the provisions of
the Act that concern the computation of federal payments to the States. Social Security Act § 403. These
payments are presently computed in relation to the
State's contribution to individual recipients, with federal
payment of five-sixths of the first $18 a month per
recipient of state expenditure, and further payment up
to a maximum of $32 a month per recipient. There is
no limitation on federal payments based on family size
in the present provisions, nor has there ever been such
a limitation in previous versions of the Act.
Section 403 (d) (1) of the Act imposes a limitation
on federal payments to States as respects children whose
eligibility is based upon the absence from the home
of a parent. Under this section, the number of AFDC
children under the age of 18 for whom federal sharing
is available cannot exceed the 'ratio of AFDC children
eligible because of an "absent parent" to the total child
incidence of births out of wedlock and otherwise strengthening
family life .....

Section 432 of the Act. 42 U. S. C. § 632 (1964 ed., Supp. IV),
provides for the establishment of work-incentive programs for
AFDC recipients which include the placement of recipients over the
age of 16 in employment, "institutional and work experience training
for those individuals for whom such training is likely to lead to
regular employment.," and "special work projects for individuals
for whom a job in the regular economy cannot be found." See
also Social Security Act § 402 (a) (19).
The State must also provide foster care in accordance with § 408
of the Act. See Social Security Act § 402 (a) (20). And whenever
the State feels that AFDC payments may not be used in the best
interests of the child, it may provide for counseling or guidance with
respect to the use of such payments and the management of other
funds. Social Security Act § 405, 42 U. S. C. § 605.

population of a State as of January 1, 1968. Appellants have argued that this limitation somehow indicates congressional approval of the maximum grant
concept. The District Court below properly rejected
that contention. The Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means indicates that the purpose of
the limitation is to keep federal financial participation
"within reasonable bounds" and to "give the States an.
incentive to make effective use of the constructive
programs which the bill would establish." H. R. Rep.
No. 544, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 110. Keeping federal participation "within reasonable bounds" was tied to the
fact that the "absent parent" category of AFDC recipients was the one that was growing most rapidly.
Ibid. This provision, however, relates only to federal
contributions to a State's AFDC program, and does not
authorize the State's termination of aid to any of the
children who would otherwise be eligible for aid because
of an absent parent. Representative Mills explained
the purpose of this limitation to the House in the following terms:
"Finally, Mr. Chairman, the bill would add a provision to present law which would limit Federal
financing for the largest AFDC category-where the
parent is absent from the home-to the proportion
of each State's total child population that is now
receiving AFDC in this category. This provision,
we believe, would give the States an additional incentive to make effective use of the constructive
programs which the bill would establish. Moreover,
this limitation on Federal matching will not prevent
any deserving family from receiving aid payments.
The States would not be free to keep any family
off the rolls to keep within this limitation because

23055.
In sum, the provisions of the Act that compute
the amount of federal contribution to state AFDC programs are related to state payments to individual recipients and have consistently excluded any limitation
based upon family size. The limitation contained in
§403 (d) (1) of the Act -affects only the amount of
federal matching funds in one category of aid, and in
no way indicates congressional approval of maximum
grants.
The purpose of the AFDC provisions of the Social
Security Act is not only to provide for the needs of
dependent children but also "to keep the young children
with their mother in their own home, thus preventing
the necessity of placing the children in institutions."
S. Rep. No. 628, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 17 (1935).
Also see Social Security Act §401. As the District
Court noted, however, "the maximum grant regulation
provides a powerful economic incentive to break up
large families by placing 'dependent children' in excess
of those whose subsistence needs, when added. to the
subsistence needs of other members of the family, exceed
the maximum grant, in the homes of persons included
in the class of eligible 'relatives." 297 F. Supp., at 456.
By this device, payments for the "excess" children can
be obtained.
"If Mrs. Williams were to place two of her children of twelve years or over with relatives, each
child so placed would be eligible for assistance in
the amount of $79.00 per month, and she and her
six remaining children would still be eligible to receive the maximum grant of $250.00. If Mr. and

Mrs. Gary were to place two of their children between the ages of six and twelve with relatives, each
child so placed would be eligible for assistance in
the amount of $65.00 per month, and they and their
six remaining children would still be eligible to
receive the maximum grant of $250.00." Id., at
453-454.
The District Court correctly states that this incentive
to break up family units created by the maximum grant
regulation is in conflict with a fundamental purpose of
the Act.
The history of the Social Security Act thus indicates
that Congress intended the financial benefits, as well
as the other benefits, of the AFDC program to reach
each individual recipient eligible under the federal criteria. It was to this purpose that Congress had reference when it commanded in § 402 (a)(10) of the Act
that aid to families with dependent children shall be
furnished to "all eligible individuals."
The Court attempts to avoid the effect of this command by stating that "it is the family grant that is
affected." Ante, at 477-478. The implication isthat, regardless of how the AFDC payments are computed or
to whom they apply, the payments will be used by the
parents for the benefit of all the members of the family
unit. This is no doubt true. But the fact that parents
may take portions of the payments intended for certain
children to give to other children who are not given
payments under the State's AFDC plan, does not alter
the fact that aid is not being given by the State to the
latter children. And it is payments by the State, not
by the parents, to which the command of § 402 (a) (10)
is directed. The Court's argument would equate family

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS
471

DouciAs, J., dissenting

grant maximums with percentage reductions, but the
two are, in fact, quite distinct devices for limiting welfare payments. If Congress wished to design a scheme
under which each family received equal payments, irrespective of the size of the family, I. see nothing that
would prevent it from doing so. But that is not the
scheme of Congress under the present Act.
Against the legislative history and the command of
§ 402 (a) (10), the appellants cite three provisions of the
Social Security Act as recognizing the validity of state
maximum grant regulations.
The first of these provisions is § 402 (a) (23) of the
Act, 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(23) (1964 ed., Supp. IV),
which provides:
"[A State plan for aid and services to needy families
with children must] provide that by July 1, 1969,
the amounts used by the State to determine the
needs of individuals will have been adjusted to reflect fully changes in living costs since such amounts
were established, and any maximums that the State
imposes on the amount of aid paid to families will
have been proportionately adjusted."
This section had its genesis in an Administration proposal to require States -to pay fully the amounts required
by their standard of need, and also to make cost-ofliving adjustments to that standard of need by July 1,
1968, and annually thereafter. Hearings on H. R. 5710
before the House Committee -on Ways and Means, 90th
Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 59 (1967); House Committee
on Ways and Means, Section-by-Section Analysis and
Explanation of Provisions of H. R. 5710, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., 36 (Comm. Print) (1967). The bill that emerged
from the House as H. R. 12080, however, did not include
any provision relating to an increase in benefit levels or

adjustments to standards of need.

397 U. S.

See Hearings on

H. R. 12080 before the Senate Committee on Finance,
90th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 109-144 (1967). A provision requiring a cost-of-living adjustment in the standard of need by July 1, 1969, and annually thereafter was
added to the House bill by the Senate Finance Committee, and this provision also required that "any maximums . . . on the amount of aid" be proportionately

adjusted. S. Rep. No. 744, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 293
(1967). An amendment of the bill was proposed in the
Senate that would have required a positive increase in
AFDC payments, but that amendment was rejected.
113 Cong. Rec. 33560. The Senate-House Conference
Committee adopted the Senate AFDC cost-of-living provision, omitting only the requirement for annual updating of need standards after July 1, 1969. H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 1030, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 63 (1967).
Nowhere in any of the hearings, committee reports,
or floor debates, is there shown a congressional intent to
validate state maximum grant regulations by the provisions of § 402 (a) (23). Rather, the legislative history
shows that Congress was exclusively concerned with increasing the income of AFDC recipients. If Congress
had not required cost-of-living adjustments in state-imposed grant maximums, the States could easily nullify
the effect of the cost-of-living adjustments for many
AFDC families by retaining the grant ceilings in force
before the adjustment was made. Congress was, to be
sure, acknowledging the existence of max'mum grant
regulations. But every congressional reference to an
existing practice does not automatically imply approval
of that practice. The task of statutory construction
requires more. It requires courts to look to the context
of that reference, and to the history of relevant legislation.* In the present context, the reference to maximum

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS
471

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

grants was necessary to preserve the integrity of the
cost-of-living adjustment required by the bill. No further significance can legitimately be read into that
reference.
Appellants also rely on § 108 (a) of Pub. L. 87-543, 76
Stat. 189, a provision of the Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 that amended § 406 of the Act. This
amendment, which has sincebeen superseded, authorized
"protective payments" to an individual other than the
relative with whom the dependent child is living. The
problem which this amendment was designed -to cure
was that some payees were unable to manage their
funds so that the dependent children received the full
benefit of the AFDC payments. Hearings on H. R.
10606 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 87th
Cong., 2d Sess., 137 (1962). The House bill required
"a meeting of all need as determined by the State" as
a condition to including "protective payments" within
the definition of "aid to families with dependent children." The Senate Finance Committee changed that
requirement, however, by an amendment which authorized federal funding of "protective payments" if
the state-determined need of individuals with respect to
whom such payments were made was fully met by their
assistance payment and other income or resources. The
Senate Committee explained this provision as follows:
"The effect of this provision is to make it possible
for protective payments to be made in behalf of
certain ADC recipients in States in which there is a
maximum limiting the amount of assistance an
individual may receive. These are the cases in
which the statutory maximum does not prevent
need from being met in full according to the State's
standards." S. Rep. No. 1589, 87th Cong., 2d Sess.,
14 (1962).

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

397 U. S.

This reference to a state-imposed maximum can hardly
be interpreted as a congressional approval of a family
maximum grant. If anything, it implicitly disapproves
the concept by withholding federal payments with respect to individuals receiving "protective payments"
when a maximum grant operates to prevent these individuals from receiving the full amount of their statedetermined need.
The final statutory provision relied upon by appellants
is § 220 (a) of Pub. L. 90-248, 81 Stat. 898, which added
to the Medical Assistance Title of the Act a new § 1903
(f), 42 U. S. C. § 1396b (f) (1964 ed., Supp. IV). This
section limits federal financial participation in medical
assistance benefits to those whose incomes do not exceed
1331/3% of the highest amount of AFDC assistance paid
to a family of the same size without any income or resources. This section, however, also provides: "If the
Secretary [of HEW] finds that the operation of a uniform maximum limits paymehts to families of more than
one size, he may adjust the amount otherwise determined . . . to take account of families of different sizes."
The purpose of this provision was to allow qualification
as medically indigent of those individuals who would
have qualified but for the operation of an AFDC-grant
maximum, and thus prevent the extension of the operation of grant maximums into the Medical Assistance
Title. Congressional rejection of grant maximums in
the Medical Assistance Title does not infer their approval in the context of the AFDC provisions. Quite
the contrary would seem to be the case.
In all of the legislative provisions relied upon by the
appellants, the congressional reference to maximum
grants has been made in the context of attempting to
alleviate the harsh results of their application, not in a
context of approving and supporting their operation.
The three statutory references cited by appellants and

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

J., dissenting

discussed above are clearly inadequate to overcome the
long history of concern manifested in the AFDC provisions of the Social Security Act for meeting the needs
of each eligible recipient, and the command of § 402 (a)
(10) of the Act to that effect.
Appellants tender one further argument as to the
compliance of the Maryland maximum grant regulation
with the Social Security Act. That argument is that
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has
not disapproved of any of the Maryland plans that
have included maximum grant provisions, and that this
lack of disapproval by HEW is a binding administrative
determination as to the conformity of the regulation
with the Social Security Act. That argument was
thoroughly explored by the District Court below in its
supplemental opinion. The District Court accepted the
claim that HEW considers the Maryland maximum grant
regulation not to be violative of the Act, but held:
"In view of the fact, however, that there is no indication from administrative decision, promulgated
regulation, or departmental statement that the question of the conformity of maximum grants to the
Act has been given considered treatment, we believe
that the various actions and inactions on the part
of HEW are not entitled to substantial, much less
to decisive, weight in our consideration of the instant
case." 297 F. Supp., at 460.
HEW seldom has formally challenged the compliance of
a state'welfare plan with the terms of the Social Security Act. See Note, Federal Judicial Review of State
Welfare Practices, 67 Col. L. Rev. 84, 91 (1967). The
mere absence of such a formal challenge, whatever may
be said for its constituting an affirmative determination
of the compliance of a state plan with the Social Security Act, is not such a determination as is entitled to

decisive weight in the judicial determination of this
question.
On the basis of the inconsistency of the Maryland
maximum grant regulation with the Social Security Act,
I would affirm the judgment below.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN

joins, dissenting.

For the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE

to
which I add some comments of my own, I believe that
the Court has erroneously concluded that Maryland's
maximum grant regulation is consistent with the federal
statute. In my view, that regulation is fundamentally
in conflict with the basic structure and purposes of the
Social Security Act.
More important in the long run than this misreading
of a federal statute, however, is the Court's emasculation of the Equal Protection Clause as a constitutional principle applicable to the area of social welfare
administration. The Court holds today that regardless
of the arbitrariness of a classification it must be sustained if any state goal can be imagined that is arguably furthered by its effects. This is so even though
the classification's underinclusiveness or overinclusiveness clearly demonstrates that its actual basis is something other than that asserted by the State, and even
though the relationship between the classification and the
state interests which it purports to serve is so tenuous
that it could not seriously be maintained that the classification tends to accomplish the ascribed goals.
The Court recognizes, as it must, that this case involves "the most basic economic needs of impoverished
human beings," and that there is therefore a "dramatically real factual difference" between the instant case
and those decisions upon which the Court relies. The
acknowledgment that these dramatic differences exist is
DOUGLAS,

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

a candid recognition that the Court's decision today is
wholly without precedent. I cannot subscribe to the
Court's sweeping refusal to accord the Equal Protection
Clause any role in this entire area of the law, and I therefore dissent from both parts of the :Court's decision.
I
At the outset, it should be emphasized exactly what
is involved in determining whether this maximum grant
regulation is consistent with and valid under the federal
law. In administering, its AFDC program, Maryland
has established its own standards of need, and they are
not under challenge in this litigation. Indeed, the District Court specifically refused to require additional appropriations on the part of the State or to permit
appellees to recover a monetary judgment against the
State. At the same time, however, there is no contention, nor could there be any, that the maximum grant
regulation is in any manner related to calculation of
need.' Rather, it arbitrarily cuts across state-defined
standards of need to deny any additional assistance with
2
respect to the fifth or any succeeding child in a family.
In short, the regulation represents no less than the
refusal of the State to give any aid whatsoever for the
support of certain dependent children who meet the
standards of need that the State itself has established.
IThe Court is thus wrong in speaking of "the greater ability of
large families--because of the inherent economies of scale-to accommodate their needs to diminished per capita, payments."
Those
economies have already been taken into account once in calculating
the standard of need. Indeed, it borders on the ludicrous to suggest
that a large family is more capable of living on perhaps 50% of
its standard of need than a small family is on 95%.
2 Because of minor variations in the calculation of the subsistence
needs of particular families, and because the maximum grant varies
between $240 and $250 per month, depending upon the county in
which a particular family resides, the cutoff point between families
that receive the full subsistence allowance" and those that do not

397 U. S.

Since its inception in the Social Security Act of 1935,
the focus of the federal AFDC program has been to
provide benefits for the support of dependent children
of needy families with a view toward maintaining and
strengthening family life within the family unit. As
succinctly stated by the Senate Committee on Finance,
"[t]he objective of the aid to dependent children program is to provide cash assistance for needy children
in their own homes." I In meeting these objectives,
moreover, Congress has provided the outlines that the
AFDC plan is to follow if a State should choose to participate in the federal program. The maximum grant
regulation, however, does not fall within these outlines
or accord with the purposes of the Act. And the Court
by approving it allows for a complete departure from the
congressional intent.
The phrase "aid to families with dependent children,"
from which the AFDC program derives its name, appears in § 402 (a)(10) of the Act, 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(10)
(1964 ed., Supp. IV), and is defined in 42 U. S. C. § 606 (b)
(1964 ed., Supp. IV) as, inter alia, "money payments
with respect to . . . dependent children." (Emphasis
added.) Moreover, the term "dependent child" is also
extensively defined in the Act. See 42 U. S. C. § 606 (a)
(1964 ed., Supp. IV). Nowhere in the Act is there
any sanction or authority for the State to alter those
definitions-that is, to select arbitrarily from among the
is not precisely families of more than six members. In practice, it
appears that the subsistence needs of a family of six members are
fully met. The needs of the seventh member (i. e., the fifth or sixth
child, depending upon whether one or both parents are within the
assistance unit), as defined by the State are met, if at all, only
to a very small extent. In the usual situation, no payments whatever would be made with respect to any additional eligible dependent
children.

class of needy dependent children those whom it will aid.
Yet. the clear effect of the maximum grant regulation
is to do just that, for the regulation creates in effect
a class of otherwise eligible dependent children with
respect to whom no assistance is granted.
It was to disapprove just such an arbitrary device to
limit AFDC payments that Congress amended § 402
(a) (10) in 1950 to provide that aid "shall be furnished
with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals."
(Emphasis added.)
Surely, as my Brother DOUGLAS
demonstrates, this statutory language means at least that
the State must take into account the needs of, and provide aid with respect to, all needy dependent children.
Indeed, that was our assessment of the congressional
design embodied in the AFDC program in King v. Smith,
392 U. S. 309, 329-330, 333 (1968).
The opinion of the Court attempts to avoid this reading of the statutory mandate by the conclusion that
parents will see that all the children in a large family
share in whatever resources are available so that all children "do receive some aid." And "[s]o long as some aid
is provided to all eligible families and all eligible children, the statute itself is not violated." The Court also
views sympathetically the State's contention that the
"all eligible individuals" clause was designed solely to
prevent discrimination against new applicants for AFDC
benefits. I am unpersuaded, however, by the view
that Congress simultaneously prohibited discrimination
against one class of dependent children-those in families not presently receiving benefits-and at the same
time sanctioned discrimination against another classthose children in large families. Furthermore, the
Court's interpretation would permit a State to impose
a drastically reduced maximum grant limitation-or,
indeed, a uniform payment of, say, $25 per family per
month-as long as all families were subject to the rule.

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
MARSHALL,

Thus, merely by purporting to compute standards of
need and granting some benefits to all eligible families,
the State would comply with the federal law-in spite
of the fact that the needs of no or very few dependent
children would thereby be taken into account in the
actual assistance granted. I cannot agree that Congress
intended that a State should be entitled to participate
in the federally funded AFDC program under such
circumstances.
Moreover, the practical consequences of the maximum
grant regulation in question here confirm my view that it
is invalid. Under the complicated formula for determining the extent of federal support for the AFDC program
in the various States, the federal subsidy is based upon
"the total number of recipients of aid to families with
dependent children." 42 U. S. C. § 603 (a) (1964 ed.,
Supp. IV). "Recipients" is defined in the same provision to include both dependent children and the eligible
relative or relatives with whom they live. There is,
however, no limitation upon the number of recipients per
family unit for whom the federal subsidy-is paid to the
States. Thus, when a maximum family grant regulation
is in effect, the State continues to receive a federal subsidy for each and every dependent child even though the
State passes none of this subsidy on to the large families
for the use of the additional dependent children.
Specifically, in Maryland, the record in this case indicates that the State spends an average of almost $40
per recipient per month. Under the federal matching
formula, federal funds provide $22 of the first $32 per
recipient, with anything above $32 being supplied by the
State. However, the Federal Government provides a
4 More technically, the Federal Government
supplies five-sixths
of the overall amount spent per recipient up to $18, plus one-half
of tile amount from $18 to $32, to a tot., of $22. See 42 U. S. C.
§ 603 (1964 ed., Supp. IV).

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

maximum of $22 for every dependent child, although..
none of that amount is received by the needy family
in the case of the fifth or sixth and succeeding children.
The effect is to shift a greater proportion of the support
of large families from the State to the Federal Government as the family size increases. Indeed, if the size
of the family should exceed 11, the State would
succeed in transferring the entire support burden for
the family to the Federal Government, and even make a
"profit" in the sense that it would receive more from the
Federal Government with respect to the family than the
$250 maximum that is actually paid to that family.
It is impossible to conclude that Congress intended so
incongruous a result. On the contrary, when Congress
undertook to subsidize payments on behalf of each
recipient-includingeach dependent child-it seems clear
that Congress intended each needy dependent child, to
receive the use and benefit of at least the incremental
amount of the federal subsidy paid on his account.
A second effect of the maximum family grant regulation further demonstrates its inconsistency with the
federal program. As administered in Maryland, the
regulation serves to provide a strong economic incentive
to the disintegration of large families. This is so because a family subject to the maximum regulation can,
merely by placing the ineligible children in the homes of
other relatives, receive additional monthly payments for
the support of these additional dependent children. 5
When families are receiving support that is concededly
far below their bare minimum subsistence needs, the
economic incentive that the maximum grant regulation
provides to divide up large families can hardly be viewed
as speculative or negligible. The opinion of this Court
5 For example, in the case of the appellee Mrs. Williams, if she
were to place two of her children over 12 years of age with relatives,

does not even dispute this effect.' The Court answers
by saying that the family relationship "may be attenuated but. it cannot be destroyed." Yet it was just this
kind of attenuation that, as the legislative history conclusively demonstrates, 7 Congress was concerned with
eliminating in establishing the AFDC program. The
Court's rationale takes a long step backwards toward the
time when persons were dependent upon the charity of
their relatives-:--the very situation meant to be remedied
by AFDC;
child.

Thus, a total of $408 per month, or $158 above the maxi-

murn, would be available for the support of Mrs. Williams and her
eight children.

Similarly, if appellees Mr. and Mrs. Gary were to

place with relatives two of their children who are between the ages
of 6 and 12 years, each child would be eligible to receive $65.
Hence Mr. and Mrs. Gary and their eight children would receive
support in the amount of $380 per month, or some $130 above the
family maximum.
The State has, contended that the economic incentive to the
disintegration of large families that the maximum grant regulation
provides is merely speculative. However, serious doubt is cast upon
this view by the stipulation of facts entered in the District Court.
whibh states in part that, despite the strong desire to keep their
families together, appellees in this case ,were having great difficulty
in doing so because of the limitations on their grants.
In S. Rep. No. 628, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., i7 (1935), the original
goals of the AFDC program are stated as follows: "With no income
coming in, and with young children for whom provision must be
made for a number of years, families without a father's support
require public assistance, unless they have been left, with adequate
means or are aided by friends and -relatives....

Through cash

grants 'adjusted to the needs of the family it is possible to keep
the young children with their mother in their own home, thus preventing the necessity of placing the children in institutions. This is
recognized by everyone to be the least expensive and altogether the
most desirable method for meeting the needs of these families that
has yet been devised." (Emphasis added.) See also H. R. Rep.
No. 615, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1935).
These goals remain the same today. See 42 U. S. C. § 601 (1964
ed., Supp. IV). See generally Note, Welfare's "Condition X," 76

Despite its denial of the principle that payments
should be made with regard to all eligible individuals
and its conflict with the basic purposes of the Act, the
Maryland regulation is nevertheless found by the Court
to be consistent with the federal law because the existence of such regulations has been recognized by Congress.
To bolster this view, the Court argues that the same
conclusion has been reached by the department charged
with administering the Act. On neither score is the
Court convincing.
With regard to the position of the Secretary of HEW,
about all that can be said with confidence is that we
do not know his views on the validity of family maximum regulations within the federal structure., The
reason is simple-he has not been asked. Thus, contrary to our admonition given today to the district
courts in considering cases in this area, that whenever
possible they "should obtain the views of HEW in those
cases where it has not set forth its views," Rosado v.
Wyman, ante, at 407, the Government was not invited
to file a brief in this case. Perhaps the reason is that
this Court is fully versed in the complexities of the
Fede'al AFDC program. I am dubious, however, when
8

In various briefs submitted both to this Court and to other

courts in analogous litigation, the Secretary of HEW and the
Solieitor.General have taken the occasion to label family maximum
grant regulations as "arbitrary," oppressive of large families, as
-resulting in "patently different treatment of individuals," and having
received, at least inferentially, the disfavor of Congress. See, e. g.,
Memorandum for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Rosado v.
Wyman, ante, p. 397; Brief of Robert H. Finch, Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare as Amicus Curiae, Lampton v.
Bonin, 299 F. Supp. 336, 304 F. Supp. 1384 (D. C. E. D. La. 1969);
Brief of Robert H. Finch, Jefferson v. Hackney, 304 F. Supp.
1332 (D. C. N. D. Tex. 1969). Hence the views of HEW on the
precise issue presented in the instant case are, at the very best,
ambiguous and quile possibl'y the opposite of what the Court
ascribes to it.

the Court explicitly relies on the failure of the Secretary
to disapprove the Maryland welfare scheme. For if
anything at all is completely clear in this area of the
law it is that the failure of HEW to cut off funds from
a state program has no meaning at all. See Rosado v.

Finally, the Court tells us that Congress has said
that the. Act permits maximum grant regulations. If
it had, this part of the case would be obvious; but, of
course, it has not. There is no indication Congress has
focused on the family maximum as opposed to individual
or other maximums or combinations of such limiting devices.' And, to the extent that it could be said to have
done so, as my Brother DOUGLAS fully demonstrates, it
was in the context of disapproving all maximums and
ameliorating the harshness of their effects. See also
Rosado v. Wyman, supra, at 413-414. These slender
threads of legislative comment simply cannot be woven
into a conclusion of legislative sanction. Cf. Shapiro v.

amount, as a percentage of the individual's budgetary deficit (i. e.,
the difference between need and other income), or in both ways.
A system of individual maximums may, or may not, be combined
with a family maximum, or, alternatively, a family maximum
may be imposed in the absence of individual maximums. See

there are differing methods by which family maximums may be
related to other resources available to the family. Some States,
including Maryland, subtract available resources from the statecalculated need; in other jurisdictions, available resources are
subtracted from the family maximum. See, e. g., Dews v. Henry,

children" and did not intend "arbitrarily to leave one
class of destitute children entirely without meaningful protection." 392 U. S., at 330. (Emphasis in original.) That reasoning is likewise applicable to the instant case, in which the maximum grant regulation
excludes consideration of the needs of a certain class
of dependent children in large families. It is apparent,
therefore, that Maryland's maximum grant regulation is
not consistent with the Social Security Act, and hence

reaches the wrong result and lays down an insupportable
test for determining whether a State has denied-its citizens the equal protection of the laws.
The Maryland AFDC program in its basic structure
operates uniformly with regard to all needy children
by taking into account the basic subsistence needs of
all eligible individuals in the formulation of the standards of need for families of various sizes. However,
superimposed upon this uniform system is the maximum
grant regulation, the operative effect of which is to
create two classes of needy children and two classes of
eligible families: those small families and their members
who receive payments to cover their subsistence needs
and those large families who do not."
This classification process effected by the maximum
grant regulation produces a basic denial of equal treatment. Persons who are ,concededly similarly situated
(dependent children and their families), are not afforded equal, or even approximately equal, treatment
under the maximum grant regulation. Subsistence benefits are paid with respect to some needy dependent
children; nothing is paid with respect to others. Some
needy families receive full subsistence assistance as calculated by the State; the assistance paid to other families is grossly below their similarly calculated needs.
"In theory, no payments are made with respect to needy dependent children in excess of four or five as the case may be. In practice, of course, the excess children share in the benefits that are
paid with respect to the other members of the family. The result
is that support for the entire family is reduced below minimum
subsistence levels. However, for purposes of equal protection analysis, it makes no difference whether 'the class against, which the
maximum grant regulation discriminates is defined as eligible dependent children in excess of the fourth or fifth, or, alternatively,
as individuals in large families generally, that is, -those with more
than six members.

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

Yet, as a general principle, individuals should not be
afforded different treatment by the State unless there
is a relevant distinction between them, and "a statutory
discrimination must be based on differences that are
reasonably related to the purposes of the Act in which
it is found." Morey v. Doud, 354 U. S.457, 465 (1957).
See Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S.
150, 155 (1897). Consequently, the State may not, in
the provision of important services or the distribution
of governmental payments, supply benefits to some individuals while deifying them to others who are similarly situated. See, e. g., Griffin v. County School Board
of Prince Edward County, 377 U. S. 218 (1964).
In the instant case, the only distinction between those
children with respect to whom assistance is granted and
those children who are denied such assistance is the size
of the family into which the child permits himself to
be born. The class of individuals with respect to whom
payments are actually made (the first four or five eligible
dependent children in a family), is grossly underinclusive
in terms of the class that the AFDC program was designed to assist, namely, all needy dependent children.
Such underinclusiveness manifests "a prima facie violation of the equal protection requirement of reasonable
classification," 12 compelling the State to come forward
with a persuasive justification for the classification.
The Court never undertakes to inquife for such a
justification; rather it avoids the task by focusing upon
the abstract dichotomy between two different approaches
to equal protection problems that have been utilized
by this Court.
Under the so-called "traditional test," a classification
is said to be permissible under the Equal Protection
Clause unless it is "without any reasonable basis."

a "fundamental right," then the state interest in perpetuating the classification must be "compelling" in order

to the regulation of business interests. The extremes
to which the Court has gone in dreaming up rational
bases for state regulation in that area may ih many
instances be ascribed to a healthy revulsion from the
Court's earlier excesses in using the Constitution to
protect interests that have more than enough power
to protect themselves in the legislative halls. This case,
involving the literally vital interests of a powerless
minority--poor families without breadwinners-is far

removed from the area of business regulation, as the
Court concedes. Why then is the standard used in those
cases imposed here? We are told no more than that this
case falls in "the area of economics and social welfare,"
with the implication that from there the answer is
obvious.

not appreciably advanced by the' a priori definition of
a "right," fundamental or otherwise. 4 Rather, con13 See generally Developments in the Law-Equal Protection, 82

centration must be placed upon the character of the
classification in question, the relative importance to individuals in the class discriminated against of the governmental benefits that they do not receive, and the
asserted state interests in support of the classification.
As we said only recently, "In determining whether or
not a state law violates the Equal Protection Clause,
we must consider the facts and circumstances behind
the law,- the interests which the State claims to be
protecting, and the-interests of those who are disadvantaged by the classification." Kramer v. Union School

by the maximum grant regulation. They cite, for example,
Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535 (1942), for the proposition that
the "right of procreation" is fundamental. This statement is no
doubt accurate as far as it goes, but the effect of the maximum
grant regulation upon the right of procreation is marginal and
indirect at. best., totally unlike the compulsory sterilization law that
was at issue in Skinner.
At the same time the Court's insistence that equal protection

analysis turns on the basis of a closed category of "fundamental
rights" involves a curious value judgment. It is certainly difficult
to believe that a person whose very survival is at stake would be
comforted by the knowledge that his "fundamental" rights are preserved intact.

It is the individual interests here at stake that, as
the Court concedes, most clearly distinguish this case
from the "business regulation" equal protection cases.
AFDC support to needy dependent children provides
the stuff that sustains those children's lives: food,
clothing, shelter." And this Court has already recognized several times that when a benefit, even a "gra-

Nor is the distinction upon which the deprivation is
here based-the distinction between large and small
families-one that readily commends itself as a basis
for determining which children are to have support
approximating subsistence and which are not. Indeed,
governmental discrimination between children on the
basis of a factor over which they have no control-the
number of their brothers and sisters-bears some resemblance to the classification between legitimate and
illegitimate children which we condemned as a Violation
of the Equal Protection Clause in Levy v. Louisiana,
391 U. S. 68 (1968).
The asserted state interests in the maintenance of the
maximum grant regulation, on the other hand, are
hardly clear. In the early stages of this litigation, the
State attempted to rationalize the maximum grant regulation on the theory that it was merely a device to conserve state funds, in the language of the motion to dismiss, "a legitimate way of allocating the State's limited
resources available for AFDC assistance." Indeed, the
initial opinion of the District Court concluded that the
sole reason for the regulation, as revealed by the record,
was "to fit the total needs of the State's dependent
children, as measured by the State's standards of their
subsistence requirements, into an inadequate State appropriation." 297 F. Supp., at 458. The District Court
quite properly rejected this asserted justification, for
preservation of life and health of persons unable to live without
public assistance, and their dependent children."
These cases and those cited in n. 17, supra, suggest that whether
or not there is a constitutional "right" to subsistence (as to which
see n. 14, supra), deprivations of benefits necessary for subsistence
will receive closer constitutional scrutiny, under both the Due
Process and Equal Protection Clauses, than will deprivations of less
essential forms of governmental entitlements.

"[t]he saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification." Shapiro v. Thompson,
supra, at 633. See Goldberg v. Kelly, ante, at 266.
In post-trial proceedings in the District Court, and in
briefs to this court, the State apparently abandoned
reliance on the fiscal justification. In its place, there
have now appeared several different rationales for the
maximum grant regulation, prominent among them being
those relied upon by the majority-the notions that
imposition of the maximum serves as an incentive to
welfare recipients to find and maintain employment
and provides a semblance of equality with persons earning a minimum wage.
With regard to the latter, Maryland has urged that
the maximum grant regulation serves to maintain a
rough equality between wage earning families and AFDC
families, thereby increasing the political support foror perhaps reducing the opposition to-the AFDC program. It is questionable whether the Court really relies
on this ground, especially when in many States the prescribed family maximum bears no such relation to the
minimum wage. 9 But the Court does not indicate that
a different result might obtain in other cases. Indeed,
whether elimination of the maximum would produce
welfare incomes out of line with other incomes in
Maryland is itself open to question on this record."0
19See HEW Report on Money Payments to Recipients of Special
Types of Public Assistance, Oct. 1967, Table 4 (NCSS Report D-4).
"°The State of Maryland has long spoken with at least two
voices on the issue of the maximum graiit regulation. The Department of Public Welfare has taken the position, over a number of

years, that the regulation should be abolished and has made several
proposals to that effect. In so doing, the Department has taken
the position that its proposals would not set welfare benefits out
of line with household incomes throughout the State. See, e. g.,
Minutes of State Board of Public Welfare Meeting, September 26,
1958, App. 130-132.

DANDRIDGE v. WILLIAMS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

It is true that government in the United States, unlike
certain other countries, has not chosen to make public
aid available to assist families generally in raising their
children. Rather, in this case Maryland, with the encouragement and assistance of the Federal Government,
has elected to provide assistance at a subsistence level
for those in particular need-the aged, the blind, the
infirm, and the unemployed and unemployable, and their
children. The only question presented here is whether,
having once undertaken such a program, the State may
arbitrarily select from among the concededly eligible
those to whom it will provide benefits. And it is too
late to argue that political expediency will sustain discrimination not otherwise supportable. Cf. Cooper v.
Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958).
Vital to the employment-incentive basis found by the
Court to sustain the regulation is, of course, the sup,position that an appreciable number of AFDC recipients
are in fact employable. For it is perfectly obvious that
limitations upon assistance cannot reasonably operate
as a work incentive with regard to those who cannot
work or who cannot be expected to work. In this connection, Maryland candidly notes that "only a very small
percentage of the total universe of welfare recipients are
employable." The State, however, urges us to ignore
the "total universe" and to concentrate attention instead
upon the heads of AFDC families. Yet the very purpose of the AFDC program since its inception has been
to provide assistance for dependent children. The
State's position is thus that the State may deprive certain needy children of assistance to which they would
otherwise be entitled in order to provide an arguable
work incentive for their parents. But the State may
not wield its economic whip in this fashion when the
effect is to cause a deprivation to needy dependen t children in order to correct an arguable fault of their parents.

396 U.. S. 488 (1970).
Even if the invitation of the State to focus upon the
heads of AFDC families is accepted, the minimum rationality of the maximum grant regulation is hard to
discern. The District Court found that of Maryland's
more than 32,000 AFDC families, only about 116 could
be classified as having employable members, and, of
these, the number to which the maximum grant regulation was applicable is not disclosed by the record. The
State objects that this figure includes only families in
which the father is unemployed and fails to take account
of families in which an employable mother is the head
of the household. At the same time, however, the State
itself has recognized that the vast proportion of these
mothers are in fact unemployable because they are mentally or physically incapacitated, because they have no
marketable skills, or, most prominently, because the best
interests of the children dictate that the mother remain
in the home." Thus, it is clear, although the record
does not disclose precise figures, that the total number
of "employable" mothers is but a fraction of the total
number of AFDC mothers. Furthermore, the record is
silent as to what proportion of large families subject to
the maximum have "employable" mothers. Indeed, one
21Indeed, Rule 200, § IX A (2) (b)(5) of the Manual of the
Md. Dept. of Social Services prohibits the referral for employment
of AFDC mothers who are needed in the home. And the unsuitability of many AFDC mothers has been well chronicled in Md. Dept.
of Social Services, Profile of Caseloads, Research Report No. 5, p. 6
(1969). See also Carter, The Employment Potential of AFDC
Mothers, 6 Welfare in Review, No. 4, pp. 1, 4 (1968).

MARSHALL,

must assume that the presence of the mother in the home
can be less easily dispensed with in the case of large
families, particularly where small children are involved
and alternative provisions for their care are accordingly
more difficult to arrange. In short, not only has the State
failed to establish that there is a substantial or even a
significant proportion of AFDC heads of households as to
whom the maximum grant regulation arguably serves
as a viable and logical work incentive, but it is also indisputable that the regulation at best is drastically overinclusive since it applies with equal vigor to a very
substantial number of persons who like appellees are
completely disabled from working.
Finally, it should be noted that, to the extent there
is a legitimate state interest in encouraging heads of
AFDC households to find employment, application of the
maximum grant regulation is also grossly underinclusive
because it singles out and affects only large families.
No reason is suggested why this particular group should
be carved out for the purpose of having unusually harsh
"work incentives" imposed upon them. Not only has
the State, selected for special treatment a small group
from among similarly situated families, but it has done
so on a basis-family size-that bears no relation to
the evil that the State claims the regulation was designed
to correct. There is simply no indication whatever that
heads of large families, as opposed to heads of small
families, are particularly prone to refuse to seek or
to maintain employment.
The State has presented other arguments to support
the regulation. However, they are not dealt with
specifically by the Court, and the reason is .not difficult to discern. The Court has picked the strongest
available; the others suffer from similar and greater

defects. 2

Moreover, it is relevant to note that both
Congress and the State have adopted other measures
that deal specifically with exactly those interests the
State contends are advanced by the maximum grant
regulation. Thus, for example, employable AFDC recipients are required to seek employment through the
congressionally established Work Incentive Program
which provides an elaborate system of counseling, training, and incentive payments for heads of AFDC families.
See generally 42 U. S. C.. §§ 630-644 (1964 ed., Supp.
IV).23 The existence of these alternatives does not, of
course, conclusively establish the invalidity of the maximum grant regulation. It is certainly relevant, however, in appraising the overall interest of the State in the
maintenance of the regulation.
In the final analysis, Maryland has set up an AFDC
program structured to calculate and pay the minimum
standard of need to dependent children. Having set up
that program, however, the State denies some of those
22 Thus, the State cannot single out a minuscule proportion of
the total number of families in the State as in need of birth control
incentives. Not only is the classification effected by the regulation
totally underinclusive if this is its rationale, but it also arbitrarily
punishes children for factors beyond their control, and overinclusively applies to families like appellees' that were already large
before it became necessary to seek assistance. For similar reasons,
the argument that the regulation serves as a disincentive to desertion
does not stand scrutiny.
23 Likewise, the State, with the encouragement of Congress, see
42 U. S. C. §§,602 (a) (21), 610 (1964 ed., Supp. IV), has developed
extensive statutory provisions to deal specifically with the problem
of parental desertion. See generally Md. Ann. Code, Art.. 27,
§§ 88-96 (1967 Repl. Vol.). And Congress has mandated, with
respect to family planning, that the States provide services to AFDC
recipients with the objective of "preventing or reducing the incidence of births out of wedlock and otherwise strengthening family
life." 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a) (15) (1964 ed., Supp. IV).

needy children the minimum subsistence standard of
living, and it does so on the wholly arbitrary basis that
they happen to be members of large families. One need
not speculate too far on the actual reason for the regulation, for in the early stages of this litigation the State
virtually conceded that it set out to limit the total cost
of the program along the path of least resistance. Now,
however, we are told that other rationales can be manufactured to support the regulation and to sustain it
against a fundamental constitutional challenge.
However, these asserted state interests, which are not
insignificant in themselves, are advanced either not at all
or by complete accident by the maximum grant regula-tion. Clearly they could be served by measures far less
destructive of the individual interests at stake. Moreover, the device assertedly chosen to further them is at
one arid the same time both grossly underinclusivebecause it does not apply at all to a much larger class
in an equal position-and grossly overinclusive-because
it applies so strongly against a substantial class as to
which it can rationally serve no end. Were this a case
of pure business regulation, these defects would place it
beyond what has heretofore seemed a borderline case,
see, e. g., Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336
U. S. 106 (1949), and I do not believe that the regulation can be sustained even under the Court's "reasonableness" test.
In any event, it cannot suffice merely to invoke the
spectre of the past and to recite from Lindsley v.. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. and Williamson v. Lee. OpticalCo. to decide the case. Appellees are not a gas company
or an optical dispenser; they are needy dependent children and families who are discriminated against by the
State. The basis of that discrimination-the classification of individuals into large and small families-is too

arbitrary and too unconnected to the asserted rationale,
the impact on those discriminated against-the denial of
even a subsistence existence-too great, and the supposed
interests served too contrived and attenuated to meet the
requirements of the Constitution. In my view Maryland's maximum grant regulation is invalid under the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.
