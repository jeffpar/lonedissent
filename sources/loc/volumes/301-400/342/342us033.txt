CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 79.

Argued October 16, 1951.-Continued November 5, 1951.

This cause is continued for such period as will enable counsel for
petitioner to secure a determination from the Supreme Court of
California as to whether its judgment herein was intended to rest

the federal claim was necessary to the judgment rendered. Pp.
33-34.

Franklin C. Stark, acting under appointment by the
Court, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.
Clarence A. Linn, Assistant Attorney General of California, argued the cause for respondent. With him on
the brief were Edmund G. Brown, Attorney General, and
Howard S. Goldin, Assistant Attorney General.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted in the California Superior
Court in 1949 of making and possessing counterfeiting
dies or plates in violation of Cal. Penal Code, 1949, ยง 480.
He did not appeal, but sought to challenge the validity
of his conviction by filing successive petitions for a writ
of habeas corpus in the California Superior Court and
California District Court of Appeal.
Following denial of these petitions, he instituted this
case by filing an original petition for a writ of habeas
corpus in the Supreme Court of California. The Supreme Court of California denied the petition without
opinion, two justices thereof voting for issuance of the
writ. We granted certiorari, 341 U. S. 938, because of
a serious claim that petitioner had been deprived of his
rights under the Federal Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1951.
Opinion of the Court.

342 U. S.

At the bar of this Court, the Attorney General of the
State of California argued that habeas corpus was not
a proper state remedy for determination of petitioner's
federal claim. It is the position of the Attorney General
that petitioner's failure to appeal in this case barred him
from seeking post-conviction relief by way of a collateral
habeas corpus proceeding. He admits that habeas corpus
is available in California in cases involving certain exceptional circumstances, but contends that this is not
such a case. If the Attorney General is correct, the judgment may rest on a non-federal ground, thus calling for
dismissal of our writ of certiorari. In this state of uncertainty, we follow our precedents in Herb v. Pitcairn,324
U. S. 117 (1945), and Loftus v. Illinois, 334 U. S. 804
(1948).
Accordingly, the cause is ordered continued for such
period as will enable counsel for petitioner to secure a
determination from the Supreme Court of California as
to whether the judgment herein was intended to rest
on an adequate independent state ground or 'whether
decision of the federal claim was necessary to the judgment rendered.
Cause continued.
