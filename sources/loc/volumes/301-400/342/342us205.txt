UNITED STATES v. HAYMAN.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 23.

Argued October 15, 1951.-Decided January. 7, 1952.

Under 28 U. S. C. § 2255, which provides that a federal prisoner may
move the sentencing court to vacate, set aside or correct any sentence subject to collateral attack, respondent, confined in a federal
penitentiary in the State -of Washington, filed in the Federal District Court in California a motion to vacate his sentence and grant
a new trial. - He alleged that at his trial he did not have the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment,
because his counsel was also counsel for another person, who was
the principal witness against respondent and was defendant in a
related case. The District Court, without notice to respondent
and without ordering the presence of respondent, found that the
counsel's dual representation was with respondent's knowledge and
consent, and denied respondent's motion. Held: The District
Court erred in determining the factual issues raised by respondent's motion under § 2255 without notice to respondent and without his presence. Pp. 206-224.
1. A review of the history of § 2255 shows that it was passed
at the instance of the Judicial Conference to meet practical problems that had. arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts. Pp. 210-219.
2. Section 2255 was not intended to impinge upon prisoners'
rights of collateral attack upon their convictions; its sole purpose
was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient
forum. Pp. 214-219.
3. In making findings on controverted issues of fact relating to.
respondent's own knowledge without notice to respondent and
without his being present, the District Court did not proceed in
conformity with § 2255. Pp. 219-223.
. (a) The crucial issue of fact presented by respondent's mo-.
tion under § 2255 was whether his counsel represented the other
person with respondent's knowledge and consent, and respondent's presence at a hearing on this issue is necessary if the pro-

cedure under § 2255 is to be adequate and effective in this case,
Pp. 219-220.
(b) Issuance of an order to produce the prisoner is auxiliary
to the jurisdiction of the trial court over respondent granted in
§ 2255 itself and invoked by respondent's filing of a motion under
that section. Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, distinguished. Pp.
220-222.
(c) Where, as here, there are substantial issues of fact as to
events in which the prisoner participated, the trial court should
require his production for a hearing. Pp. 222-223.
4. The procedure prescribed by § 2255 will be adequate and
effective if respondent is present for a hearing in the District
Court on remand of this case; and, in the circumstances, this Court
does not reach the constitutional questions presented. P. 223.
5. The Court of Appeals correctly reversed the order of the District Court, but should have remanded the case for a hearing under § 2255 instead of ordering that respondent's motion be dismissed. Pp. 223-224.

Opinion of the Court.

342 U. S.

Respondent, confined at the McNeil Island penitentiary in the Western District of Washington,' invoked
this new procedure by filing a motion to vacate his sentence and grant a new trial in the District Court for the
Southern District of California. That court had imposed
a sentence of twenty years' imprisonment in 1947 for
forging Government checks and related violations of
federal law.'
In his motion, respondent alleged that he did not enjoy
the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed defendants
in federal courts by the Sixth Amendment. Specifically,
he alleged that one Juanita Jackson, a principal witness
against respondent at his trial and a defendant in a related case, was represented by the same lawyer as respondent. Respondent claims that he was not told of
the dual representation and that he had no way of discovering the conflict until after the trial was over. It
appeared from court records that Juanita Jackson testified against respondent after entering a plea of guilty but
before sentence. Since a conflict in the interests of his
attorney might have prejudiced respondent under these
circumstances, the sentencing court and the court below,
one judge dissenting, found that the allegations of respondent's motion warranted a hearing. Respondent's
motion requested the issuance of an order to secure his
presence at such a hearing.
For three days, the District Court received testimony
in connection with the issues of fact raised by the motion.
This proceeding was conducted without notice to respondent and without ordering the presence of respondent.
On the basis of this ex parte investigation, the District
Court found as a fact that respondent's counsel had also

represented Juanita Jackson but that he "did so only
with the knowledge and consent, and at the instance
and request of [respondent]." Pursuant to this finding,
the District Court entered an order denying respondent's
motion to vacate his sentence and to grant a new trial.
On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,' the majority, acting sua sponte, raised questions
as to the adequacy and constitutionality of Section 2255.
The court addressed itself to the provision that an application for a writ of habeas corpus "shall not be entertained" where the sentencing court has denied relief
"unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention." Considering that the proceedings in the District
Court were proper under the terms of Section 2255, the
court below held, one judge dissenting, that the Section
.2255 procedure could not be adequate or effective in this
case and, in the alternative, that the Section, in precluding resort tohabeas corpus, amounted to an unconstitutional "suspension" of the writ of habeas corpus as
to resoondent,.5
On rehearing below, and again in this Court, the Gov'
ernment conceded that respondent's motion raised factual
issues which required respondent's presence at a hearing.
The Court of Appeals, however, refused, either to affirm
the denial of respondent's motion or to accept the Government's concession' and remand the case for a hearing
-with respondent present. Instead, it treated Section
2255 as a nullity and ordered respondent's motion dis,'The appeal

was timely.

under Section 2255 are governed by the civil rules applicable to

missed so that respondent might proceed by habeas corpus
in the district of his-confinement. 187 F. 2d 456.
We granted certiorari in this case, 341 U. S. 930 (1951),
to review- the decision that Section 2255 must be considered a nullity, a holding that stands in conflict with
cases decided in other circuits.' We do not reconsider
the concurrent findings of both courts below that respondent's motion states grounds to support a collateral attack
on his sentence and raises substantial issues of fact calling
for an inquiry into their verity.
First. The need for Section 2255 is best revealed by
a review of the practical problems that had arisen in the
administration of the, federal courts' habeas corpus
jurisdiction.
Power to issue the writ of habeas corpus, "the most
celebrated writ in the English law,"' was granted to the
federal courts in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73,
81-82. Since Congress had not defined the term "habeas
corpus," resort to the common law was necessary.8 Al6 Martin v. Hiatt, 174 F. 2d 350 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1949), and Barrett

v. Hunter, 180 F. 2d 510 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1950), have held expressly
that Section 2255 is constitutional. Habeas corpus was also denied
on the basis of Section 2255 in the following cases in other circuits
without any suggestion that the Section was invalid: Smith v. Reid,
89 U. S. App. D. C. -,
191 F. 2d 491 (C. A. D. C. Cir. 1951);
Meyers v. Welch, 179 F. 2d 707 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1950); Weber v.
Steele, 185 F. 2d 799 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1950). And in the following
cases, other circuits remanded Section 2255 proceedings for hearing
without suggesting that the Section was unconstitutional or inadequate: United States v. Paglia, 190 F. 2d 445 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1951);
Howard v. United States, 186 F. 2d 778 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1951); United

Opinion of the Court.

though the objective of the Great Writ long has been
the liberation of those unlawfully imprisoned, at common
law a judgment of conviction rendered by a court of general criminal jurisdiction was conclusive proof that confinement was legal. Such a judgment prevented issuance
of the writ without more.'
In 1867, Congress changed the common-law rule by
extending the writ of habeas corpus to " l cases where
any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the
United States," and providing for inquiry into the facts
of detention. 14 Stat. 385. In commenting on the 1867
Act this Court has said:
"The effect is to substitute for the bare legal review
that seems to have been the limit of judicial authority under the common-law practice, and under the
act of 31 Car. II, c. 2, a more searching investigation,
.in. which the applicant is put upon his oath to set
forth the truth of the matter respecting the causes
of his detention, and the court, upon determining
the actual facts, is to 'dispose of the party as law
and justice require.'
a prisoner in custody pursuant to the final
judgment of a . . . court of criminal jurisdiction
may have a judicial inquiry in a court of the United
States into the very truth and substance of the causes
of his detention, although it may become necessary
to lookbehind and beyond the record of his conviction to a sufficient extent to test the jurisdiction of
the . . . court to proceed to judgment against
him ...

Opinion of the Court.

342 U. S.

Under the 1867 Act," United States District Courts
have jurisdiction to determine whether a prisoner has
been deprived of liberty in violation of constitutional
rights, although the proceedings resulting in incarceration
may be unassailable on the face of the record. Under
that Act, a variety of allegations have-been held to permit
challenge of convictions on facts dehors the record. 2
One aftermath of these developments in the law has
been a great increase in the number of applications for
habeas corpus filed in the federal courts by state and federal prisoners. The annual volume of applications had
nearly tripled in the years preceding enactment of Section 2255."3 In addition to the problems raised by a large
volume of applications for habeas corpus that are repetitious 14 and patently frivolous, serious administrative
problems developed in the consideration of applications
which appear meritorious on their face. Often, such apNow incorporated in 28 U. S. C. (Supp. IV) § 2241 et seq.

(1945) (denial of right to consult with counsel)..
'" During 1936 and 1937, an annual average of 310 applications
for habeas corpus were filed in the District Courts and an annual
average of 22 prisoners were released. By 1943, 1944 and 1945,
however, the annual average of filings reached 845, although an
average of only 26 prisoners were released per year. Figures from
tables submitted to the Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary
Committees. See pp. 215-216, infra.
These figures do not include the District Court for the District
of Columbia where a similar increase in the volume of applications
for habeas corpus had been reported. See Dorsey v. Gill, 80 U. S.

plications are found to be wholly lacking in merit when
compared with the records of the sentencing court. But,
since a habeas corpus action must be brought in the district of confinement, 5 those records are not readily available to the habeas corpus court.
Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275 (1941), illustrates
a further practical problem presented when an application for habeas corpus alleges a meritorious claim not controverted by the records of the trial court. In the Northern District of California, Walker alleged that he had
been denied counsel and coerced into pleading guilty by
the United States Attorney, his assistant and a deputy
marshal in the Northern District of Texas. The District
Court for the Northern District of California refused to
grant the writ after receiving ex parte affidavits from the
federal officers denying the allegations. This Court reversed, finding that Walker's application raised material
issues of fact and holding that the District Court must
determine such issues by the taking of evidence, not by ex
parte affidavits.' Granting the need for such a hearing to
resolve the factual issues, the required hearing hadc to be
.held in the habeas corpus court in California although the
federal officers involved were stationed in Texas and the
facts occurred in Texas."
These practical problems have been greatly aggravated
by the fact that the few District Courts in whose territorial jurisdiction major federal penal institutions are lorepeater petitions. Speck, Statistics on Federal Habeas Corpus,
10 Ohio St. L. J. 337, 352 (1949). See also Pricezv. Johnston, 334

cated were required to handle an inordinate number of
habeas corpus actions far from the scene of the facts, the
homes of the witnesses and the records of the sentencing
court solely because of the fortuitous concentration of
federal prisoners within the district.18
Second. The Judicial Conference of the.United States, 9
addressing itself to the problems raised by the increased
habeas corpus business in 1942, created a committee of
federal judges "to study the entire subject of procedure
on applications for habeas corpus in the federal courts." 20

Habeas Corpus Procedure submitted its report. After
extensive consideration, the Judicial Conference recomconstitutional right might be made at any time after judgment.

18 Of all habeas corpus applications filed by federal prisoners, 63%
were filed in but five of the eighty-four District Courts. And, although habeas corpus trials average only 3% of all trials in all
districts, the proportion of habeas corpus trials in those five districts
has run from 20% to as high as 65% of all trials conducted in the
district.
The basic data, compiled by Speck, note 14, 'supra, covers the
six years immediately preceding enactment of Section 2255 in 1948.
Again, the figures do not include the District Court for the District
of Columbia. The five districts are: Northern California (Alcatraz);
Northern Georgia (Atlanta) ; Kansas (Leavenworth) ; Western Washington (IcNeil Is.); and Western Missouri (Springfield Medical
Center).

mended adoption of two proposed bills, a "procedural
bill" containing provisions designed to prevent abuse of
the habeas corpus writ and a "jurisdictional bill," Section
2 of which established a procedure whereby a federal
prisoner might collaterally attack his conviction in the
sentencing court.21 The Judicial Conference repeatedly
reaffirmed its approval of this forerunner of Section 2255.2
In 1944, the two bills approved by the Judicial Conference were submitted to the Congress on behalf of the
Conference. In the letter of transmittal and accompanying memorandum, Section 2 of the "jurisdictional bill"
was described as requiring prisoners convicted in federal
courts to apply by motion in the sentencing court "instead
of making application for habeas corpus in the district in
which they are confined." 23 At the request of the Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, a
"Statement" describing the necessity and purposes of the
bills was submitted to Congress on behalf of the Judicial
Report of the Judicial Conference (1943) 22-24.
22-Report of the Judicial Conference (1944) 22; id. (1945) 18.
23 Letter of transmittal, dated
March 2, 1944. The complete
21

description of Section 2 of the jurisdictional bill in the memorandum
is as follows:
"Section two of the jurisdictional bill refers to prisoners who have
been convicted in a federal court, and requires them, instead of making application for habeas corpus in the district in which they are
confined, to apply by motion to the trial court to vacate or set aside
the judgment. That court is then required to grant a prompt hearing and render its decision on the motion, from which an appeal lies
to the circuit court of appeals. If it appears that it is not practicable
for the prisoner to have his motion determined in the trial court
because of his inability to be present at the hearing, 'or for other
reasons,' then he has the right to make application to the court in
the district where he is confined. Such an instance might occur where
a dangerous prisoner, who lbad been convicted in the Southern District
of New York, was confined in Alcatraz Penitentiary. The bill expressly provides that no circuit or district judge of the United States
shall entertain an application 'for a writ in behalf of any prisoner

Conference Committee on Habeas Corpus Procedure. In
this Statement, Congress was furnished statistics showing
in detail the increased volume of applications for habeas
corpus." The Statement, stressing the practical difficulties encountered in hearings held in the district of confinement rather than the district of sentence, described
Section 2 of the "jurisdictional bill" as follows:
"This section applies only to Federal .sentences. It
creates a statutory remedy consisting of a motion
before the court where the movant has been convicted. The remedy is in the nature of, but much
unless it appears that his right to discharge cannot be determined by
motion made in the trial court."
As submitted to Congress, Section 2 of the jurisdictional bill
provided:
"No circuit or district judge'of the United States shall entertain an
application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of any prisoner who is
authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to the provisions
of this section, unless it appears that it has not been or will not be
practicable to determine his rights to discharge from custody on
such a motion because of his inability to be present at the hearing
on such motion, or for other reasons. Where the prisoner has sought
relief on such a motion, if the circuit or district judge concludes that
it has not been practicable to determine the prisoner's rights on such
motion, the findings, order, or judgment on the motion shall not be
asserted as a defense to the prisoner's application for relief on habeas
corpus."

broader than, coram nobis. The motion remedy
broadly covers all situations where the sentence is
'open to collateral attack.' As a remedy, it is intended to be as broad as habeas corpus." "
25 The Statement, prepared by Circuit Judge Stone and al)proved
by Chief Justice Stone, described the practical considerations as
follows:
"Most habeas corpus cases raise fact issues involving the trial
occurrences or tile alleged actions of judges, United States attorneys,
marshals or other court officials. Obviously, it involves interruption
of judicial duties if the trial judge, the United States attorney, the
court clerk or the marshal (one or all of them) are required to attend
the habeas corpus hearing as witnesses. Such attendance is sometimes
necessary to refute particular testimony which the prisoner may give
and, obviously, such attendance is the safest course. This is so
because experience has demonstrated that often petitioner will testify
to anything he may think useful, however false; and, without the
witnesses present to refute such, he is encouraged to do so and may
make out a case for discharge from merited punishment. Some
realization of the possible extent of this burden on Court officials
may be gained from the bare statement that, while convictions occur
in all of the Districts throughout the country, federal prisoners are
confined in a very small number of penal institutions; and habeas
corpus must now be brought in the District where the petitioner is
confined. Even if the testimony of these officials is taken by deposition, the interference and interruption is merely lessened in degree
and the above danger is risked.
"The main disadvantages of the motion remedy are as follows:
The risk during or the expense of transporting the prisoner to the
District where lie was convicted; and the incentive to file baseless
motions in order to have a 'joy ride' away from the prison at Government expense.
"Balancing these, as well as less important, considerations, the Conference is of opinion that the advantages outweigh and that the
motion renedy is preferable. As to the risk (escape or delivery)
while transporting the prisoner to the District of conviction, the
difference is only one of degree-of distance and, therefore, of opportunity. As to the expense, it is highly probable that it would be
more expensive for the Government witnesses to go from the District where sentence was imposed and return than for the prisoner

342 U. S.

While the bills proposed by the Judicial Conference
were pending, the Committee on Revision of the Laws of
the House of Representatives had drafted a bill revising
the entire Judicial Code. Portions of this bill dealing
with habeas corpus were drafted to conform with the bills
approved by the Judicial Conference, 6 including Section
2255, modeled after Section 2 of the "jurisdictional bill"
approved by the Judicial Conference. According to the
Reviser's Note on Section 2255:
"This section restates, clarifies and simplifies the
procedure in the nature of the ancient writ of error
coram nobis. It provides an expeditious remedy for
correcting erroneous sentences without resort to habeas corpus. It has the approval of the Judicial
Conference of the United States. Its principal provisions are incorporated in H. R. 4233, Seventy-ninth
Congress [the so-called jurisdictional bill]." 27
After the House of Representatives had passed the bill
revising the Judicial Code, the Judicial Conference reconsidered the two bills drafted by its Committee on Habeas
Corpus Procedure. The Conference noted the importance of securing legislation along the lines of its proposals, approved the habeas corpus chapter of the Judicial Code revision bill with two amendments not affecting
Section 2255 and directed that Congress be informed of
to be brought to such District and returned. As to the incentive
to file petitions, the difference is between a longer and a shorter trip
to the Court. It is thought that the provision in Section 2 providing

for habeas corpus (in the District of confinement) where it is not
'practicable to determine his rights

. . .

on such a motion' will

furnish a sufficient discretion in the judge or court before whom
habeas corpus is filed to evaluate and defeat the above 'disadvantages' to a loTge degree." P. 8.

Opinion of the Court.

the interest of the Conference in the enactment of the
habeas corpus provisions of the revised Judicial Code. 8
This review of the history of Section 2255 shows that
it was passed at the instance of the Judicial Conference
to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts.
Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any
purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral
attack upon their convictions. On the contrary, the sole
purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in
habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in
2
another and more convenient forum. Y
Third. The crucial issue of fact presented by respondent's motion under Section 2255 was whether his attorney appeared as counsel for Juanita Jackson "with the
knowledge and consent" of respondent. The Court of
Appeals found, and the Government now agrees, that respondent's presence at a hearing on this issue is required
if the Section 2255 procedure is to be adequate and effective in this case. In holding that Section 2255 should
be treated as a nullity in this case, the court below found
that the Section contemplated and permitted the ex parte
investigation conducted by the District Court without
notice to respondent and without respondent's presence.
We do not find in Section 2255 the disturbing inadequacies found by the court below. The issues raised by
respondent's motion were not determined by the "files
and records" in the trial court. In such circumstances,
Section 2255 requires that the trial court act on the motion as follows: ".

thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact
and conclusions of law with respect thereto." (Emphasis
supplied.) -In requiring a "hearing," the Section "has
obvious reference to the tradition of judicial proceedings." I Respondent, denied an opportunity to be heard,
"has lost something indispensable, however convincing
the ex parte showing." "' We conclude that the District
Court did not proceed in conformity with Section 2255
when it made findings on controverted issues of fact relating to respondent's own knowledge without notice to
respondent and without his being present.
The court below also held that the sentencing court
could not hola the required hearing because it was without power to order the presence of a prisoner confined in
another district. This want of power was thought to
follow from our decision in .Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188
(1948), where we held that the phrase "within their respective jurisdictions" in the habeas corpus statute 2 required the presence of the prisoner within, the territorial
jurisdiction of the District Court as a prerequisite to his
filing an application for habeas corpus. This is not a
habeas corpus proceeding. The sentencing court in the
Southern District of California would not be issuing an
original writ of habeas corpus to secure respondent's presence from another district. Issuance of an order to produce the prisoner is auxiliary to the jurisdiction of the
trial court over respondent granted in Section 2255 itself
and invoked by xespondent's filing of &motion under that
Section.
The very purpose of Section 2255 is to hold any required hearing in the sentencing court because of the inc6nvenience of transporting court officials and other nec30

secure respondent's presence in the sentencing court to
testify or otherwise prosecute his motion is "necessary or
appropriate" I to the exercise of its jurisdiction under
Section 2255 and finds ample precedent in the common
law."s The express language of Section 2255 that a "court
may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing" negatives any purpose to leave the sentencing court powerless
to require production of the prisoner in an appropriate
case.36 Other federal courts conducting Section 2255

34 See Adams v. United States ex rt. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 272273 (1942).
35 In determining what auxiliary writs are. "agreeable to the usages
and principles of law," we look first to the common law. See Price
v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 281 (1948). In addition to "the great
and efficacious writ," habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, other varieties
of the'writ were known to the common law. Blackstone described
the writs of habeas corpus "ad prosequendum, testificandum, deliborandum, etc.; which issue when it is necessary to remove a prisoner,
in order to prosecute or bear testimony in any court, or to be tried
in the proper jurisdiction wherein the fact was committed." 3 Black-'
stone's Commentaries 129-130. See Ex parte Boilman, 4 Cranch 75,
97-98 (1807).
It is argued that the relerence to the common law writ of error

usual sense. Congress did not adopt the coram nobis.procedure
as it existed at common law, the Reviser's Note :merely tating that
the Section 2255 motion was "in the nature of" the coram nobii writ
in the sense that a Section 2255 proceeding,, like. coram nobis, is an
independent action brought in the court that entered judgment: Note

proceedings have not encountered difficulties in securing
the presence of prisoners confined outside the district.
The existence of power to produce the prisoner does
not, of course, mean that he should be automatically produced in every Section 2255 proceeding. This is in accord with procedure in habeas corpus actions.38 Unlike
the criminal trial where the guilt of the defendant is in
issue and his presence is required by the Sixth Amendment, a proceedig under Section 2255 is an independent
and collateral inquiry into the validity of the conviction.

could be determined in a coram nobis proceeding without the presence of the prisoner, the New York Court of Appeals recently holding that his presence was required under the common law. People

UNITED STATES v. HAYMAN.
205

Opinion of the Court.

Whether the prisoner should be produced depends upon
the issues raised by the particular case. Where, as here,
there are substantial issues of fact as to events in which
the prisoner participated, the trial court should require
his production for a hearing? 9
Fourth. Nothing has been shown to warrant our holding at this stage of the proceeding that the Section 2255
procedure will be "inadequate or ineffective" if respondent is present for a hearing in the District Court on remand of this case. In a case where the Section 2255
procedure is shown to be "inadequate or ineffective," the
Section provides that the habeas corpus remedy shall remain open to afford the necessary hearing." Under such
circumstances, we do not reach constitutional questions-.
This Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of an
act of Congress where the question is properly presented
unless such adjudication is unavoidable 41 much less anticipate constitutional questions.42
We conclude that the District Court erred in determining the factual issues raised by respondent's motion under
Section 2255 without notice to respondent and without
his presence. We hold that the required hearing can be
afforded respondent under the procedure established in
Section 2255. The Court of Appeals correctly reversed

Barrett v. Hunter, 180 F. 2d 510, 514 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1950).
If Section 2255 had not expressly required that the extraordinary
remedy of habeas corpus be withheld pending resort to established
procedures providing the same relief, the same result would have
followed under our decisions. Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1951) ;
