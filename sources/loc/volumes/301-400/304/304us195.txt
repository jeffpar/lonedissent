OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

304 U. S.

shares of the stock of "No. 1100 Park Avenue," and disclosed tax of $2,084.20, which was paid. The taxable income was less than the profit in question. It resulted
from the sale by him, April 11, 1929, for a net price of
$240,000 of stock bought in 1928 for $46,000. The buyer
agreed to pay $25,000 cash and the balance in installments
of $1,875 a month. For 1930, respondent and his wife
filed a return showing no taxable income. For 1931 and
1932, respondent filed no returns. In 1932 he filed a claim
for refund of the entire 1929 income tax. The ground
for the claim was that he was entitled to report the sale
on the installment basis. The findings indicate that the
deferred payments were worth less than face value; after
respondent and his wife (to whom he assigned the contract) had received $55,000, they agreed to accept $75,000
more as full payment. The commissioner rejected the
claim and this suit followed. The Court of Claims gave
respondent judgment. 18 F. Supp. 965. This Court
granted a writ of certiorari because of conflict between
the decision and that of the circuit court of appeals for
the ninth circuit in Pacific National Co. v. Welch, 91
F. (2d) 590, this day affirmed, ante, p. 191. The question here presented is the same as the one decided in that
case. The judgment of the court below must be
Reversed.
