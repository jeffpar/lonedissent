HEINER, FORMER COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL

REVENUE, v. MELLON

ET AL.,

EXECUTORS.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

Nos. 144 and 145.

Argued March 8, 1938.-Decided May 16, 1938.

The stock and business of two corporations were taken over lby two
partnerships, formed by the three stockholders, for the purpose
of liquidation. One of the partners died in 1919, but the liquidation was carried on by the survivors as theretofore. Held:
1. That net profits made in 1920 in disposing of partnership
assets were taxable, under Revenue Act, 1918, § 218 (a), to the
survix.ng partners to the extent of their distributive shares.
P. 274.
The income tax system is based on annual accounting. The
fact that it could not be known until a later year, when the
liquidation was complete, whether the enterprise had been -profitable, isof no legal significance.
2. The fact that the, partnership had been dissolved by the
death did iiot affect' this tax liability of the surviving partners.
P. 277.
Under the Pennsylvania Uniform Partnership Act, which was
,applicable, on dissolution the partnership is not terminated, but
continues until the winding up of the partnership affairs is
*completed.
3. Art. 1570, T. R. 45, does not 'provide that dissolution capitalizes all interest of the partner in future partnership profits;
it deals only with the determination of a partner's gain or loss
on his investment when he completely severs his connection

with" the partnership and its assets. P. 277.
4. The dissolution did not make 'the surviving partners trustees
taxable only as fiduciaries under Revenue Act,, 1918) § 219.
P. 278.
. The fact that they may be so denominated by the Jaw of
Pennsylvania is not conclusive. In the interpretation of the
words used.in a federal revenue act, local law is not controlling.
5. In § 218 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 the term "distributive hare" does not mean the share currently distributable under

CERTIORARI, 302 U. S. 672, to review the affirmance
of recoveries in two actions against a former Collector
of Internal Revenue by taxpayers who had paid deficiency income tax assessments under protest.
Assistant Solicitor General Bell, with whom Solicitor
General Reed, Assistant Attorney General Morris, Mr.
J. Louis Monarch, Helen R. Carloss, and Mr. George H.
Zeutzius were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. John G. Frazer,with whom Messrs. William Wallace Booth and Donald D. Shepard were on the brief,
for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEis delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These cases, tried below in the federal court for western'
Pennsylvania and argued together here, arise from the
same facts and present the same questions of law. Each
action was brought against D. B. Heiner, as former Collector of ]ternal Revenue and individually, to recover
an amount paid under protest by the taxpayer in 1927,
upon a deficiency assessment of his 1920 income tax. 1he'
,amounts taxed as additional income were the distributive
shares of certain profits alleged to have been earned by
each in 1920 as a partner in two firms, Due demand for
a refund was made. In No. 144 the taxpayer was A. W.
Mellon; in No. 145, R. B. Mellon. Both having died,
the suits are by their executors. In No. 144, the District
Court entered judgment for $202,502.22 with interest
(14 F. Supp. 424); in No. 145 for $187,787.17 with interest. These judgments were affirmed by the Court of
Appeals. 89 F. 2d 141. Certiorari was granted because

of alleged conflict as to applicable rules of law important
in the administration of the revenue laws.
There is no dispute as to the relevant facts. Prior to
December 12,1918, A. W. Mellon, R. B. Mellon and H. C.
Frick each owned one-third of the entire capital stock of
two distilling corporations-A. Overholt & Company and
West Overton Distilling Company. On that date those
three individuals formed two partnerships in which each
partner was to have a one-third interest. In January 1919
they caused to be transferred to the partnership called
A. Overholt & Company all the assets of the corporation
of that name; and to the partnership called West Overton
Distilling Company, all the assets of that corporation.
These assets included large whiskey inventories in bonded
warehouses. Neither corporation had distilled any whiskey after 1916. Liquidation of the businesses of each
had been started 'by the two corporations in 1918; and
the partneiships had been organized for the purpose of
liquidating them. The business of each partnership in
1920, had, like its business in 1919, consisted in the sale of
whiskey certificates and the storage, bottling, casing and
sale of the .stock of whiskey. It was not until 1925 that
the assets of the partnerships then remaining were sold in
bulk, and the proceeds distributed among those entitled
thereto.
Frick died December 2, 1919; but throughout 1920 the
businesses of A. Overholt & Company and of West Overton Distilling Company were conducted, and their books
were kept, in the same manner as the businesses had been
conducted and books had been kept by the partnerships
in 1919, and by the corporations in 1918. For 1920 the
partnership returns of the two concerns disclosed facts
from which it appeared that substantial gains had been
made from the sale of whiskey. But the amounts were
not-reported as income of the partnerships; and neither
A. W. Mellon nor R. B. Mellon included in their income

tax returns for 1920 any amount on account of them.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that
these sums were distributive profits; that the returns of
taxable income of A. W. Mellon and of R. B. Mellon for
the year 1920 should have included one-third of the profits
in that year of each firm from the sale of whiskey; and
made a deficiency assessment on A. W. Mellon of $190,419.70 and on R. B. Mellon of $175,259.70.
The Revenue Act of 1918' governs taxation of 1920
income. Section 218 (a) of the Act prdvides that individuals carrying on business in partnership shall be liable
in their individual capacities for the income tax on profits
earned therein, an& that in computing the net income of
each partner there shall be included -hisdistributive share,
whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for the taxable year. Section 224 provides that,
the partnership shall file an informational return setting
forth the items of its gross income, the deductions allowed
and the distributive share of net income to which each
partner is entitled.
The two Mellons filed their individual returns for 1920,
and also the informational partnership returns for that
year. While the Melons claimed that they were not taxable on their shares of the profits from whiskey sold in
1920, they recognized that they were taxable for their
shares of these other profits of the concerns earned in
1920. The partnership returns in the case of each concern showed a gain arising from storage, bottling and casing operations, sales of barrels, interest and rentals. Onethird of each of these profits was entered by each of the
Mellons in his individual return as his distributive share
of the profits of the two partnerships.
First. The primary question for decision is whether the
net profits made by the two partnerships in 1920 from the
'Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057.

HEINER v. MELLON.

Opinion of the Court.

sales of whiskey were in their nature taxable income.
Throughout 1920, A. Overholt & Company and the West
Overton Distilling Company were engaged in business.
The mere fact that the purpose of the partnerships was to
liquidate the assets taken over from the corporations is
not of legal significance. Profits made in the business
of liquidation are taxable in the same way and to the same
extent as if made in an expanding business. Nor is it
of legal significance that the liquidation was not completeci 1 itil 1925 and that until completion of the liquidation it, uld not be known whether the business venture,
taken as a whole, had been profitable. The federal income tax system is based on an annual accounting.! Under that law the question whether taxable profits have
been made is determined annually by the result of the
operations of the year.
Purchasing real estate, subdividing and selling it in
parcels is, in essence, a liquidating business. The claim
has been repeatedly made that no income was realized
until the investment was recouped; but the Board of Tax
Appeals has uniformly held in accord with Article 43 of
Regulations 45 (and later regulations) that the cost of the
real estate must be apportioned among all the lots, and
income returned upon the sales in each year, regardless of
the number of lots remaining undisposed of at the close
of the tax year. 8 A like rule has been applied where the

was engaged in selling it in parcels. The claim that there
was no taxable income until the capital had been returned
was rejected.

The fact that it might prove that when the business
was fully liquidated the profits of 1920 were offset by
heavy loss of later years is immaterial. Losses suffered
by a taxpayer in a later year may be deducted from profits,
if any, earned by him in that later year; but the tax on a
year's income may not be withheld because losses may
thereafter occur. If A. Overholt & Company and West
Overton Distilling Company had remained corporations
they would have been obliged to make each year return
of the profits made therein and pay taxes annually
throughout the period of liquidation although it might
ultimately prove that the losses of the later years exceeded
the profits of the earlier ones.' Likewise, if the concerns
had each been owned by a single individual, the fact that
his sole business was liquidating the concern would not
have relieved him from paying annually taxes on the

Opinion of the Court.

net profits. No good reason is suggested why a different
rule should apply to partnerships,
We conclude that gains from the sale of whiskey in 1920
were income of that year. The amount of the income was
determinable from the partnership books. Section 212 (b)
of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that the net income
shall be computed "in accordance with the method of
accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of"
the taxpayer, and it is not shown that the method employed clearly failed to reflect net income.
Second. The fact that the partnerships had been dissolved by Frick's death before 1921) does not affect the
liability of the Mellons as surviving partners for income
taxes on their distributive shares of the net profits made in
that year. Compare Rossmoore v. An'derson, 1 F. Supp. 35
(S. D. N. Y.), affirmed, 67 F. 2d 1009 (C. C. A. 2); Rossmoore v. Commissioner, 76 F. 2d 520 (C. C. A. 2). The
business of A. Overholt & Company did not terminate on
Frick's death. Although dissolved, the partnerships and
the business continued, since, as stated in the Pennsylvania Uniform Partnership Act: "On dissolution the partnership is not terminated, but continues until the winding
up of the partnership affairs is completed." ' Throughout
the year 1920, the business of selling stock on hand and
deriving income therefrom was carried on precisely as it
had been theretofore, and for the same purpose. Article
424 of Regulations 45 recognizes that even in the hands
of a receiver a partnership must file a return.
T'ird. The Mellons contend, and the court below held,
thac the partners' interests in the partnerships were capitalzed upon dissolution, so that until the liquidation returned to them the cost of their interests, no taxable income was received; that Article 1570 of Regulations 45

so provides; and that this did not take place before 1925.
But, as already pointed out, technical dissolution does not
affect the liability of a partner under § 218 for taxes on
his distributive share of the partnership's income; and
Article 1570 does not establish any rule that dissolution
capitalizes the interest of a partner in future partnership
profits. The article provides:
"When a partner retires from a partnership, or it is dissolved, he realizes a gain or loss measured by the difference
between the price received for his interest and the cost to
him or (if acquired prior thereto) the fair market value as
of March 1, 1913, of his interest in the partnership, including in such cost or value the amount of his share in
any undistributed partnership net income earned since
February 28, 1913, on which income tax has been
paid.
This article is in no way inconsistent with the taxation
of a partner on his share of the income of the partnership
earned in a single year after dissndution but before completion of liquidation and distribution. It deals only
with the determination, of a partner's gain or loss on his
investment when he completely severs his connection with
the partnership and its assets. The gain or loss is determined substantially like that on any other business venture of the individual, treated as a whole. On the other
hand, the profits from the sale of whiskey in 1920 were
current income of the partnership for that year, not different in their nature from the profits from storage, bottling,
casing, and similar operations which the Mellons returned
as income. Article 1570 does not deal with this situation.
Fourth.The Mellons contend that because the partnerships were dissolved by the death of Frick in 1919, A.
W. Mellon and R. B. Mellon, being surviving partners,
became by operation of law liqu;dating trustees; that any
income earned in 1920 from operations of the dissolved
partnerships was income to the Mellons only in their

fiduciary capacity as such trustees; that under § 219
of the Revenue Act of 1918 the trust estate .was a separate taxable entity; that if any income tax was due, it
was therefore due from the trust, and that its assessment
is now barred by the statute of limitations.
We do not find it necessary to determine whether assessment of the tax on this theory is now outlawed, or
whether, as the Collector urges, recovery is precluded in
any event under the doctrine of Stone v. Whte, 301 U. S.
532; for we are of the opinion that the Mellons are not
trustees within the meaning of . § 219. The fact that
they may be so denominated by the law of Pennsylvania
is not conclusive. It is well settled that in the interpretation of the words used in a federal revenue act, local
law is not controlling unless the federal -statute "by ex,,
press language or necessary implication, makes its ownr
operation dependent upon state law." "The state law
creates legal interests, but the federal statute determines
when and how they shall be taxed." Burnet v. Harmel,
287 U. S. 103, 110.' We think it is clear that under the
circumstances set forth, the incom- earned in 1920 was
income of a partnership "carrying on business" within
the meaning of § 218 rather than of a trust under
§ 219.

law, taxes on the profits made in 1920 from sales of

whiskey is in no way affected by their fiduciary obligation
under the law of the State to account to the Frick estate
for its interest in the two partnerships being liquidated.
The surviving partners continued during 1920 to conduct
the business from which they earned profits. On such
income the federal law required that taxes be paid. It
did not require that the payments be made from the
partnership assets. How the asset§ shall be disposed of,
and what shall be done with the proceeds when realized,
are matters which may be determined by the law of the
State or by agreement of the partners. But however the
assets are required by the law of the State to be disposed
of, or the proceeds applied, the federal law requires that
taxes be paid if, in disposing of them within the year the
business is conducted and profits are made.
Fifth: The Mellons conend that under the law of
Pennsylvania no distribution of profits could lawfully
have been made by the surviving partners as liquidating
trustees until all debts and liabilities, contingent or otherwise, had been paid or satisfied, and the partners' capital
returned; and that although the business of the partnerships had been carried on after dissolution precisely as
before, and the partnership accounts for the year 1920
showed large profits earned, their respective shares of
them were not distributable and could not be deemed
taxable income of the partners.
Section 218 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides
that "There shall be included in computing the net income of each partner his distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for
the taxable year. . . ." If "distributive" meant eurrently distributable under state law," the contentions
made by the Mellons might have some force. But it does
not. Article 322 of Regulations 45 (and corresponding
articles of subsequent Regulations) defines "distributive"
as meaning "proportionate." Compare Earle v. Commis-

HEINER v. MELLON.

Opinion of the Court.

sioner, 38 F. 2d 965, 967-68 (C. C. A. 1). And § 220
of the Revenue Act of 1918, taxing to the shareholders
the income of a corporation improperly accumulating its
gains and profits for the purpose of avoiding surtax, assumes that the two words are synonymous. The tax is
thus imposed upon the partner's proportionate share of
the net income of the partnership, and the fact that it
may not be currently distributable, whether by agreement of the parties or by operation of law, is not material.' No claim is made that the proportionate interests of the surviving partners was improperly determined
by the Commissioner.
Sixth. Finally, the Mellons contend that in 1928 and
1929 the Commissioner determined that no profit was
realized until final liquidation of the partnerships in 1925,
and that income taxes for that year have been collected
on this theory and not yet refunded. The' Commissioner's alleged change of position is not here important.
It is not shown that refund of these taxes is now barred
Nor is it necessary for us to consider the cost to the
Mellons of their interest in these partnerships, or whether
the Mellons' 1925 income taxeg were erroneously assessed
and collected, or whether the Commissioner correctly
settled the tax liability of the Frick estate. None of
these questions has any bearing upon the determination
of the case before us.
