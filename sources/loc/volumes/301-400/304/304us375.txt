FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION v. METROPOLITAN EDISON CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 915.

Argued May 2, 1938.-Decided May 23, 1938.

1. An order of the Federal Power Commission is not reviewable in
the' Circuit Court of Appeals under § 313 of the Federal Power
Act, as amended, unless there has. been an application to the
Commission for a rehearing. Review does not extend to an order
granting a rehearing. P. 381.
2. Section 313 (a) (b) of the Federal Power Act does not empower
the Circuit Court of Appeals to review orders of the Power Commission which are preliminary or procedural, but relates to orders of a definitive character dealing with the merits of a 'proceeding before the Commission and resulting from a hearing upon
evidence and supported by findings appropriate to the case. P. 383.
3. Where the only orders made by the Federal Power Commission
were, first, an order fixing a hearing and requiring the respondent
corporations to appear and produce certain information and documents, and, second, an order purporting to" grant a rehearing of
the first, the Circuit Court of Appeals had n6 appellate jurisdiction to restrain proceedings under the original order until the
questions raised by the petition for rehearing were deternined or
to define the scope of the rehearing and of evidence to be there
considered. Pp. 385, 387.
4. Judicial Code § 262, which provides that the federal courts shall

jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law,"
held inapplicable. Pp. 383, 387.
5. T'e Federal Power Act confers no authority upon the. Commission to enforce its directions to appear, testify or produce books
and papers save by application to a federal court under § 307 (c),
and punishment for contempt is confined to failure to obey the
order of the court. P. 386.
6. Upon such application by the Commission, respondents have full
opportunity to contest the validity of the order sought to be
enforced. Id.
7. One who refuses to attend and testify, or produce books and
papers, in obedience to a subpoena of the Commission is not punishable under § 307 (c) of the Act, if the refusal is not wilful but
made in good faith and upon grounds which entitle him to the
judgment of the court before obedience is compelled. P. 387.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHEs delivered the

opinion of

the Court.

On January 6, 1936, the Federal Power Commission
instituted an investigation to determine the "conditions,
practices, and matters regarding the ownership, operation,

management, and control" of the respondent corpora-

Opinion of the Court.

tions. The order directed respondents to file with the
Commission copies of contracts and statements of working arrangements between respondents and persons controlling them, and statements of charges on respondents'
books for 1934 and 1935 representing payments made and
obligations incurred to such persons. Respondents were
also directed to make their books, records, etc., available
for examination by the Commission's representatives.
The investigation was instituted on representations of
the Governor and Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania.
Respondents challenged the jurisdiction of the Commission to make the order, and, reserving their right to
question its legality, they furnished various data and in-.
formation. Following an examination of the books and
records of respondents, the Commission's examiners submitted a report on December 10, 1936.
Thereupon the Commission, on January 26, 1937, made
an order providing that a hearing should be held on
March 3, 1937. The order recited that the respondents
had reported charges appearing upon their books which
represented payments made and obligations incurred
to named persons as (a) "conceded affiliates" and (b)
"not conceded affiliates," respectively; that the examination of the books and records of respondents and of admitted affiliates disclosed transactions between respondents and additional named persons, and that the
accounting representatives of the Commission had submitted a report indicating that certain named persons
"control respondents, or are controlled by the same persons which control respondents." The order then directed respondents to appear at the hearing, as stated,
and to present information bearing upon the question
of ,control and specifically showing (1) their form of
organization, respectively, (2) their articles of incorporation, partnership agreements or other documents of organi-

zation, (3) the names and addresses of partners, directors,
officers, trustees and agents, (4) the ownership held by
such persons "inor over any other person named above,"
as well as the manner by which such ownership was maintained, and (5) such other data as might from time to
time be required by the Commission. The order further
directed that a copy of the report prepared by the
accounting representatives of the Commission should be
served on each person named, ard the Commission gave
notice that the hearing would be had by the Commission sitting jointly with the Public Service Commission
of Pennsylvania. See Federal Power Act, § 209(b), 49
Stat. 853.
Respondents then filed with the Commission a petition
for rehearing as to the order of January 26, 1937, asking
for the vacating of that order and the termination of
the proceeding initiated by the order of January 6, 1936.
Respondents contended that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to conduct an investigation concerning the propriety of contracts and working arrangements between
respondents and third persons, and, in particular, (1)
that the Commission was without power to investigate
for the purpose of supplying information to a state commission for use in local proceedings for violations of local
law, and, (2) that as to three of the respondents the Commission was without jurisdiction of their persons because
they were not "public utilities' as defined in the Federal
Power Act.
The Commission thereupon adjourned without day the
hearing directed by the order of January 26, 1937. Later,
the Commission granted the petition for rehearing and assigned "the matters involved" for hearing on April 14,
1937. Respondents then appeared and introduced evidence tending to support their objections to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission's counsel then in-

troduced evidence on its behalf. Respondents objected
to its admissibility upon the ground that it was immaterial to the issues presented by the petition for rehearing. Their objection was overruled and respondents then
asked the examiner to certify, to the Commission the request to define the issues to be determined on the petition
for rehearing and to instruct its representatives that no
evidence in furtherance of the orders of January 6, 1936,
and January 26, 1937, be introduced. The examiner re,
fused and respondents then presented a like request to
the Commission, which was denied on April ,20, 1937, for
the reason that its rules of practice did not provide for
that method "of interim review of the examiner's rulings."
Upon remand to the examiner, he again ruled against
respondents, stating that their rights could "be amply
protected by the usual method of exceptions" and argunent thereon.
Respondents then presented, on April 21, 1937, to the
Circuit Court of Appeals a petition asking for a rule to
show cause why the Commission should not be restrained
from taking any steps in furtherance of the inquiry under
the orders of January 6, 1936, or of January 26, 1937,
until the petition for rehearing had been di- posed of, and
from introducing any evidence except that which was
relevant to the questions raised by the petition for rehearing. The Circuit Court of Appeals, on July 6, 1937,
issued the rule to show cause, as prayed, returnable on
October 4, 1937, and on September 7, 1937, granted a
temporary stay. The Commission made its return to the
rule and asked for a dismissal of the petition. The Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision on January
27, 1938. Its decree remanded the case to the Commission "for determination in accordance with the opinion"
of the court, and restrained the Commission "from proceeding with its proposed inquiry and investigation in
-

304 U. S.

accordance with its two orders of January 6,. 1936, and
January 26. 1937, until the questions raised in the petition for rehearing are determined by it."
In its opinion the court stated that the only issues of
fact raised by the petition for rehearing and the evidence
of the respondents were that three of the respondents
were not "public utilities" as defined by the Federal
Power Act and that the purpose of the investigation was
to supply information to the. Pennsylvania Commission
for use in local proceedings designed to impose penalties
under the state law. 94 F. 2d 943, 945. The court said
(id., p. 946):
"Coming to the merits of the case, when the petition
was filed and granted it was the plain duty of the Federal
Commission to determine the issues raised in the petition.
We are going to remand the case for such determination.
In doing so the evidence admitted should be strictly confined to the two issues raised in the petition and not extended to the scope of the investigation proposed in the
orders of January 6, 1936, and January 26, 197. The
relation- of the evidence to the two questions involved
should be apparent and logicaf and not far-fetched and
remotely inferential. Some of the evidence admitted
when the case was before the Federal Commission on
rehearing was not relevant and material. If both sides
will seek to produce only such evidence as is clearly admissible, we venture to hope that the determination of
the issues will be speedy, final and satisfactory.
"In remanding -the case we express no opinion on the
merits of the questions to be decided. The determination of them is for the Federal Commission under rele-.
vant and competent.eyidence. The act has provided a
review by this court of the orders of the Federal Commission and no order on the merits is now before us. These
proceedings were taken so that the questions would not
be moot if ond when they come here;"

FED. POWER COMM'N v. EDISON CO.

381

Opinion of- the Court.

This Court granted certiorari and the cause has been
argued. We are of the opinion that the Circuit Court of
Appeals had no jurisdiction to enter the decree.
First. There. was no order of the Commission before
the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. Apart from the
question whether the order of January 6, 1936, or that
of January 26, 1937, can be regarded as reviewable, no
application for such a review had been made.
The provision conferring appellate jurisdiction on the
Circuit Court of Appeals in relation to orders of the
Federal Power Commission is found in § 313 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by the Act of August 26,
1935, c, 687, 49 Stat. 860, 861.1 Section 313 (a) provides
"Sec. 313. (a) Any person, State, municipality, or State commission aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in a proceeding under this Act to which such- person, State, municipality, or
State commission is a party may apply for a rehearing within thirty
days after the issuance of such order. The application for rehearing shall set forth specifically the ground or grounds upon which such
application is based. Upon such application the Commission shall
have power to grant or deny rehearing or to abrogate or modify its
order without further hearing. Unless the Commission acts upon
the application for rehearing within thirty days after it is filed, such
application may be deemed to have been denied. No proceeding to
review any order of the Commission shall be brought by any person
unless such person shall have made application to the Commission
.for a rehearing thereon.
"(b) Any party to a proceeding under this Act aggrieved by an
order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a
review of such order in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United
States for any circuit wherein the licensee or public utility to which
the order relates is located or has its principal place of business, or in
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by
filing in such court, within sixty days after the order of the Commission upon the application for rehearing, a written petition praying
that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole
or in part. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be served upon
any member of the Commission and thereupon the Commission shall
certify and file with the court a transcript of the record upon which

that any person aggrieved by an order of the Commission
may apply for a rehearing within thirty days after its issuanee and that no proceeding to review any order of the
Commission shall be brought unless there has been an application for a rehearing thereon.
Rdspondents say that under this provision .they could
not ask review *of the order of January 26, 1937, until
they had sought a rehearing. They did seek a rehearing
and it, was granted. No appeal from the order granting
it would lie and none was attempted. Respondents do
not contend that there was any appeal from an order, or
any application for a review of an order, pending before
the Circuit.Court of Appeals. On the contrary, respondents say that the Commission "has never passed upon
the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of such transcript such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify,
or set aside such order in whole or in part. -No objection to the
order of the Commission shall be considered by the court unless such
objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing unless there is reascnable ground for failure so
to do. The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported
by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply
to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show
to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is mate,
rial and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such
evidence in the proceedings before the Commission, the court may
order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commission
and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such
terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Commission may modify its findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file with the court such modified
or new findings which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be
conclusive, and its recommendation, if any, for the modification or
setting aside of the original order. The judgment and decree of the
*ourt, affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any
such order of the Commission, shall be final, subject to revicw by the
Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification
as provided in sections 239 and 240 of the Judicial Code, as amended
(U. S.C., title 28, secs. 346 and 347)."

FED. POWER COMM'N v. EDISON CO.

Opinion of the Court.

the objections raised in respondents' petition for rehearing with respect to the order of January 26, 1937"; that
"concededly, the minute of the Commission granting a
rehearing did not purport to decide the objections raised
in the petition for rehearing"; and that "until the Commission has made an order determining those objections,
respondents will not be in a position to perfect an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals should the Commission's determination make that necessary."
Second. Respondents seek to sustain the action of the
Circuit Court of Appeals by virtue of the authority conferred by § 262 of the Judicial Code which provides that
the federal courts shall have power "to issue all writs
not specifically provided for by statute, which may be
necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions,
and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." The
argument is that the Circuit Court of Appeals could
intervene to protect its prospective appellate jurisdiction. We are of the opinion that this contention is unsound and that the Circuit Court of Appeals in the
circumstances disclosed had no appellate jurisdicvion to
protect.
The argument proceeds on the view that the order of
January 26, 1937, despite its preliminary character, was a
reviewable order subject only to the requirement that
an application for rehearing should first be made. Reliance is placed on § 313 (b) of the Federal Power Act
that "Any party to a proceeding under this Act aggrieved
by an order issued by the Commission in such prooeeding
may obtain a review of such order in the Circuit Court
of Appeals." But neither this language, nor that of
§ 313 a), should be construed as authorizing a review
of every order that the Commission may make, albeit.
of a merely procedural character. Such a constiuction,
affording opportunity for constant delays in. the course
of the administrative proceeding for the purpose of re-

304 U. S.

viewing mere procedural requirements or interlocutory
directions, would do violence to the manifest purpose of
the provision..
The context in § 313 (b) indicates the nature of the
orders which are subject to review. Upon service of the
petition for review, the Commission is to certify and file
with the appellate court "a transcript of the record upon
which the order complained of was entered." The statute contemplates a case in which the Commission has
taken evidence and made findings. Its findings, if supported by evidence, are to be conclusive. The appellate
court may order additional evidence to be taken by the
Commission and the Commission may thereupon make
modified or new findings. The provision for review thus
relates to orders of a definitive character dealing with the
merits of a proceeding before the Commission and resulting from a hearing upon evidence and supported by findings appropriate to the case.
There are persuasive analogies in the construction of
provisions for the review of the orders of other administrative bodies. The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October
22, 1913,2 provides for cases brought to enjoin, set aside,
or suspend "any order" of the Interstate Commerce Commission. But this Court has held that "there are many
orders of the Commission which are not judicially reviewable under this provision." See United States v.
Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., 273 U. S. 299, 309, and
cases cited. In United States v. Illinois Central R. Co.,
244 U. S. 82, the Interstate Commerce Commission had
made an order for a hearing upon an issue of reparation.
The Railroad Company contended that the Commission
had no jurisdiction to award damages in the case presented. A decree of the District Court, enjoining the
Commission from proceeding with the hearing was re228 U. S. C. 47.

versed by this Court with directions to dismiss the petition. The "order" was not of the sort which brought it
within the purview of the statute. It was a mere step
in procedure. See, also, New York, 0. & W. Ry. Co. v.
United States, 14 F. 2d 850, affirmed 273 U. S. 652. Nega-_
iive orders of the Commission are not reviewable.

Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 412,

§ 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act, though called
an order, is not reviewable. United States v. Los
Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., supra. Compare United
States v. Atlanta, B. & C. R. Co., 282 U. S. 522, 527;

181, 182; United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226; Shannahan v. United States, 303 U. S. 596. With respect to
other regulatory bodies, it has been held that mere preliminary or procedural .orders are not within the statutes
providing for review by the Circuit Court of Appeals.

order was nothing more than a notice. United States v.
Illinois Central R. Co., supra, p. 89. The statute confers no authority upon the Commission to enforce its directions to appear, testify or produce books and papers
save by application to a federal court under § 307 (c).1
Upon such an application, the court may require attendance, testimony and the production of books and papers
touching the matter under investigation and failure to
obey such an order of the court may be punished by it
as a contempt. We think that this provision embraces
all cases of alleged "contumacy" on the part of any person who is required to attend, give testimony, or produce
documents. Upon such an application by the Commission for the enforcement of its order, respondents would
have full opportunity to contest its validity. See Jones
v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, supra. In the in'Subdivision (c) of § 307 of the Federal Power Act is as follows:
"(c) In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued
to, any person, the Commission may invoke the aid of any court of
the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation
or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries
on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda,
contracts, agreements, and other records. Such court may issue an
order requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer designated by the Commission, there to produce records,
if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the
court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All
process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof
such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found or may-be
doing business. Any person who willfully shall fail or refuse to
attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to produce
books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements,
or other records, if in his or its power so to do, in obedience to the
subpena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and,
upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000
or to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both."

stant case no such application by the Commission has
been made. Section 307 (c) also provides that any person who willfully fails or refuses to attend and testify,
or produce books and papers, in obedience to the subpoena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to fine and imprisonment. The
qualification that the refusal must be "willful" fully protects one whose refusal is made in good faith and upon
grounds which entitle him to the judgment of the court
before obedience is compelled.
The Commission's order of January 26, 1937, lay outside any appellate jurisdiction conferred by the statute
upon the Circuit Court of Appeals. In that view, § 262
of the Judicial Code gives no support to the decree under
review and its injunction and instructions to the Commission must be regarded as unauthorized.,
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed
and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the
respondents' petition.
