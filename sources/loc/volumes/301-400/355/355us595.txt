UNITED STATES v. MASSEI.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 98. Argued January 9, 1958.-Decided March 3, 1958.
In a tax-evasion prosecution based on the net-worth method of
proof sustained in Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, proof
of a likely source of the defendant's net-worth increases is not
essential if all possible sources of nontaxable income are negatived
by the evidence.
241 F. 2d 895, affirmed on another ground.

Roger Fisher argued the cause for the United States.
With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin,
Assistant Attorney General Rice and Joseph F. Goetten.
Richard Maguire argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The Court of Appeals has based its remand in part on
the absence of "proof of. likely source," which it regards
as an "indispensable" element of the net worth method,
citing Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, in support of its conclusion. In Holland we held that proof
of a likely source was "sufficient" to convict in a net
worth case where the Government did not negative all
the possible nontaxable sources of the alleged net worth
increase. This was not intended to imply that proof of
a likely source was necessary in every case. On the contrary, should all possible sources of nontaxable income
be negatived, there would be no necessity for proof of
a likely source. The. above explanation must be taken
