PER CURIAM.

Appellant is the owner of a 99-year perpetually renew
able lease of which the University of Miami, in Ohio, is
lessor, and which has been subjected to assessment of
county taxes pursuant to ยง 5330 of the Ohio General Code.
Appellant contends that this statute as applied violates an
exemption from taxation granted by ยง 13 of an Ohio
statute of February 17, 1809 (7 Ohio Laws, p. 188), which
allegedly became a part of her contract through execution
of the lease, and impairs the obligation of her contract
contrary to Article I, ยง 10 of the Constitution. The record,
however, does not set forth appellant's lease, and the incomplete summary of it contained in her pleading is not
adequate to enable us to determine what her rights may
be. Accordingly, we must dismiss the appeal.
Dismissed.
