OCTOBER TERM, 1942.
Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

HOLLEY v. LAWRENCE, WARDEN.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 600.

Decided January 18, 1943.

The decision of the state, court that failure to offer the testimony
of a wife at the trial, of her husband barred a later claim of the
unconstitutionality of a state statute making such testimony incompetent, held a non-federal ground adequate to support the
judgment.
Appeal dismissed.

Mr. Benjamin E. Pierce for appellant.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted. The Court has examined all the federal questions
raised by appellant. In so far as the appeal challenges
the validity of' Georgia Code ยง 38-1604, which makes incompetent the testimony of a wife at the trial of her husband, the judgment of the court below rests upon a nonfederal ground adequate to support it, namely, that the
failure to tender such testimony at the trial bairred any
later claim of the alleged constitutional right (Atlantic
Coast Line R. Co. v. Mims, 242 U. S. 532, 535). The Court
finds that no other federal question presented by the appeal
warrants review by this Court. The appeal is accordingly
dismissed.
Dismissed.
