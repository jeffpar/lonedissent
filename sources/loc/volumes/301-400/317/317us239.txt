Syllabus.

Kentucky Court of Appeals. After the petition for certiorari was filed here, the Kentucky Court of Appeals
affirmed the state court's order denying habeas corpus.
Sharpe v. Commonwealth, 292 Ky. 86, 165 S. W. 2d 993.
It thus appears that this obstacle to a consideration of the
merits of petitioner's application, which the Circuit Court
of Appeals encountered, has now been removed. The
judgment is therefore vacated, without costs, and the
cause remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for such
further proceedings as it may deem appropriate.
So ordered.

GARRETT v. MOORE-McCORMACK CO., INC. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

No. 67. Argued November 12, 1942.-Decided December 14, 1942.
1.In a suit by a seaman in a*state court for damages under § 33 of
the Merchant Marine Act and for maintenance and cure, the rights
of the parties are measured by the federal statute and admiralty
principles. P. 243.
2. The question whether a state court, in an action for damages under
§ 33 of the Merchant Marine Act and for maintenance and cure, protected all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law is a federal question reviewable under § 237 (b) of the
Judicial Code. P. 245.
3. A shipowner, who, in defense of an action by a seaman for personal
injuries, sets up the seaman's release, is under the burden of proving that it was executed freely, without deception or coercion, and
that it was made by the seaman with full understanding of his rights.
The adequacy of the consideration and the nature of the medical
and legal advice available to the seaman at the time of signing the
release are relevant to an appraisal of this understandirg. P. 246.
4. This general admiralty rule applies not, only to actions for maintenance and cure but also to actions for damages under § 33 of the
Merchant Marine Act. P. 248.
5. Section 33,of the Merchant Marine Act is to be liberally construed
for the seaman's protection; it is an integral part of the maritime
law, and rights fashioned by it are to be implemented by admiralty
rules not inconsistent with the Act. P. 248.

CERTIORARI,

316 U. S. 656, to review the .affirmance of a

judgment non obstante veredicto rendered against the
present petitioner in a suit for damages and for maintenance and cure.
Mr. Abraham E. Freedman, with whom Mr. Milton M.
Borowsky was on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Rowland C. Evans, Jr. for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE

BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner was injured while working as a seaman
for respondent on a vessel traveling between the United
States and European ports, and spent a number of months

in hospitals in Gdynia, Poland, and in the United States.
He brought this suit in a Pennsylvania state court for
damages pursuant to § 33 of the Merchant Marine (Jones)
Act,' and for maintenance and cure.2 The Pennsylvania

courts, as this litigation evidences, are apparently quite
willing to make themselves available for the enforcement

of these rights.
Petitioner attributed his condition to a blow by a hatch
cover which allegedly fell on him through respondent's
146 U. S. C. 688..
2

The right of a seaman to recover damages for negligent injury

arises under the Jones Act, and the right to maintenance and cure,
irrespective of negligence, arises under the law of admiralty.' These
rights are independent and cumulative. Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson,
278 U. S. 130, 138. For a general discussion of maintenance and cure,
see The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287

negligence. Respondent joined issue generally, contested the extent of any injuries received, and further
contended that if serioui injuries did exist they were
caused by a fight in Copenhagen or by accidents prior
to the voyage. As an additional defense the respondent
also alleged that for a consideration of $100 petitioner had
executed a full release. Denying that he had any knowledge of having signed such an instrument, the petitioner
asserted that, if his name appeared on it, his signature
was obtained through fraud and misrepresentation, and
without "legal, binding and valid consideration."
The petitioner did execute a release for $100 several
days after his return to this country. His testimony was
that his discussion with respondent's claim agent took
place while he was under the influence of drugs taken to
allay the pain of his injury, that he was threatened with
imprisonment if he did not sign as directed, and that he
considered the $100 a payment of wages. ' - The respondent's evidence Was that the $100 was paid not for wages
but to settle all claims growing out of the petitioner's
injuries, that the petitioner had not appeared to be under
the influence of drugs, and that no threats of any kind were
made.
Upon this and much other evidence relating to the cause
and extent of the injuries, the jury rendered a verdict for
the petitioner for $3000 under the Jones Act, and $1000
for maintenance and cure.
Respondent made a motion for a new trial and judgment
non obstante veredicto which under the Pennsylvania
There were two elements of the wage dispute: (a) whether wages
should be computed at $50.00 or $72.50 a month; (b) whether, since
petitioner was left in a hospital in Poland and could not return with
his ship, he should have been paid wages until be actually arrived in his
home port. He was paid only up to the time he left the vessel. There
is clear authority to support a claim for wages to the end of the voyage
for which petitioner had beer,signed. The Osceola, supra, 175.

practice was submitted to the trial court en banc. That
court gave judgment to the defendant non obstante veredicto, not upon an appraisal of disputed questions of fact
concerning the accident, but because of a conclusion that
petitioner had failed to sustain the burdtn of proof required under Pennsylvania law to invalidate the release.
It conceded that, "in admiralty cases, the responsibility is
on the defendant to sustain a release rather than on a
plaintiff to overcome it," but concluded that since petitioner had chosen to bring his action in a state, rather
than in an admiralty, court, his case must be governed
by local, rather than admiralty principles. Under the
Pennsylvania rule, one who attacks the validity of a written release has the burden of sustaining his allegation by
"clear, precise, and indubitable" evidence,'meaning evidence "that is not only found to be credible but of such
weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged
beyond a reasonable doubt." Witnesses who testify
*against the release must not only be credible, but "distinctly remember the facts to which they testify and narrate the details exactly." The court held that, since the
petitioner had not sustained this burden of proof, the trial
judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania took a somewhat
different view. It held that in an action of this sort
the Pennsylvania court was obligated "to apply the federal law creating the right of action in the same sense
in which it would have been applied in the federal courts."
However, it affirmed the judgment in the belief that the
rule as to burden of proof on releases does not affect the
substantive rights of the parties, but is merely procedural,
and is therefore controlled by state law.

'In Pennsylvania the trial judge does not pass upon such motions
alone; instead,'Afhey are heard and decided by three judges of the
court sitting en banc. Purdon, Penn. Stat. Ann., Vol. 12, Par. 680.

Opinion of the Court.

I. Respondent's argument that the Pennsylvania court
should have applied state rather than admiralty law in
measuring the rights of the parties cannot be sustained.
We do not have in this case an effort of the state court
to enforce rights claimed to be rooted in state law.
The petitioher's suit rested on asserted rights granted
by federal law and the state courts so treated it. Jurisdiction of the state court to try this case rests solely
upon § 33 of the Jones Act and upon statutes traceable
to the Judiciary Act of 1789 which "in all civil causes of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" saves to suitors
"the right of a common-law remedy where the common
law is competent to give it." 6 These statutes authorize
Pennsylvania courts to try cases coming within the defined
category. ' Whether Pennsylvania was required by the
Acts to make its courts available for those federal remedies, or whether it could create its own remedy as to
maintenance and cure based on local law, we need not
decide; 7 for, having voluntarily opened its courts to petitioner, the questions are whether Pennsylvania was thereupon required to give to petitioner the full benefit of
federal law and, if so, whether it failed to afford that,
benefit.
There is no dearth of example of the obligation oft law
courts which attempt to enforce substantive rights arising
from admiralty law to do so in a manner conforming to
admiralty practice. Contributory negligence is not a barrier to a proceeding in admiralty or under the Jones Act,
and the state courts are required to apply this rule in Jones
528 U. S.C. § 371.

state courts may not apply their doctrines of assumption
of risk in actions arising under the Act. The Arizona v.
Anelich, 298 U. S.110; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, 305
U. S. 424. State courts, whether or not applying the Jones
Act to actions arising from maritime torts, have usually
attempted, although not always with complete success, to
apply admiralty principles.' The federal courts, when
treating maritime torts.in actions at law rather than in
suits in admiralty, have also sought to preserve admiralty
principles whenever consonant with the necessities of common law procedure."
This Court has specifically held that the Jones Act is
to have a uniform application throughout the country,
unaffected by "local views of common law rules." Patiama

Opinion of the Court.

Chase, 150 U. S. 674, an 1893 decision which respondent
relies upon as establishing a contrary rule, has never been
thus considered in any of the later cases cited.
It must be remembered that the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts to try actions
either under the Merchant Marine Act or in personam
such as maintenance and cure. The source of the governing law applied is in the national, not the state, government.1 If by its practice the state court were permitted substantially to alter the rights of either litigant,
as those rights were established in federal law, the remedy
afforded by the State would not enforce, but would actually
deny, federal rights which Congress, by providing alternative remedies, intended to make not less but more secure.
The constant objective of legislation and jurisprudence is
to assure litigants full protection for all substantive rights
intended to be afforded them by the jurisdiction in which
the right itself originates. Not so long ago we sought to
achieve this result with respect to enforcement in the federal courts of rights created or governed by state law."
And admiralty courts, when invoked to protect rights
rooted in state law, endeavor to determine the issues in
accordance with the substantive law of the State." So
here, in trying this case the state court was bound to proceed in such manner that all the substantial rights of the
parties under controlling federal law would be protected.
Whether it did so raises a federal question reviewable
S. S. Co., 216 F. 566. Disagreement over the Constitutional issues of
the cases in the Jensen line has not extended to this principle. Cf.

here under § 237 (b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C.
§344 (b)."
II. A seaman in admiralty who attacks a release has no
such burden imposed upon him as that to which the Pennsylvania rule subjects him. Our historic national policy,
both legislative and judicial, points the other way. Congress has generally sought to safeguard seamen's rights.
The first Congress, on July 20, 1790, passed a protective
act for seamen in the merchant marine service, safeguarding *age contracts, providing summary remedies for their
-breach, and requiring shipowners to keep on board fresh
medicines in condition for use. 1 Stat. 131. The fifth
Congress, July 16, 1798, 1 Stat. 605, originated our present
system of marine hospitals for disabled seamen. The
language of Justice Story, sitting on Circuit in 1823,
described the solicitude with which admiralty has traditionally viewed seamen's contracts:
"They are emphatically the wards of the admiralty;
and though not technically incapable of entering into a
valid contract, they are treated in the same manner as
courts of equity are accustomed to treat young heirs,
dealing with their expectancies, wards with their guardians, and cestuis que. trustent with their trustees. . . . If
there is any undue inequality in the terms, any disproportion in the bargain, any sacrifice of rights on one side,
which are not compensated by extraordinary benefits on
the other, the judicial "interpretation of the transaction
is that the bargain is unjust and unreasonable, that advantage has been taken of the situation of the weaker
party, and that pro tanto the bargain ought to be set aside
as inequitable

...

And on every occasion the court

expects to be satisfied, that the compensation for every
material alteration is entirely adequate to the diminutior

of right or privilege on the part of the seamen." Harden
v. Gordon, Fed. Cas. No. 6047, at pp. 480, 485.
In keeping with this policy, Congress has itself acted
concerning seamen's releases in respect to wages by providing that a release for wages must be signed by a seaman in the presence of a shipping commissioner, and that,
even then, "any court having jurisdiction may on good
cause shown set aside such release and take such action
as justice shallrequire." 1 General Congressional policy
is ' further shown in the Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U. S. C. §§ 915, 916, in'
which all releases not made under the express terms of the
Act are declared invalid.
The analogy suggested by Justice Story, in the paragraph quoted above, between seamen's contracts and those
of fiduciaries and beneficiaries remains, under the prevailing rule treating seamen as wards of admiralty, a close
one. Whether the transaction under consideration is a
contract, sale, or gift between guardian and ward or
between trustee and cestui, the burden of proving its
validity is on the fiduciary. He must affirmatively show
that no advantage has been taken; and his burden is
particularly heavy where there has been inadequacy of
consideration.16
The wardship theory has, as was recognized by the
courts below, marked consequence on the treatment

266; ibid., 264 F. 938.

423, 443; Klamath Indians v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254; and
United States v. Dunn, 268 U. S. 121, 131. The .admiralty rule is well
within the bounds put on these other relationships, since many trusteecestui oi guardian and ward contracts are voidable on the election of
the beneficiary. See Wade v. Pulsifer, 54 Vt. 45, 62; Hatch v. Hatch,
9 Ves. 291 (1804); and cf. Madden, Domestic Relations, Ch. 12, and 3

given seamen's releases. Such releases are subject to
careful scrutiny. "One who claims that a seaman has
signed away his rights to what in law is due him must be
prepared to .take the burden of sustaining the release as
fairly made with and fully comprehended by the seaman."
Harmon v. United States, 59 F. 2d 372, 373. We hold,
therefore, that the burden is upon one who sets up a seaman's release to show that it was executed freely, without
deception or coercion, and that it was made by the seaman
with full understanding of his rights. The adequacy of
the consideration and the nature of the medical and legal
advice available to the seaman at the time of signing
the release are relevant to an appraisal of this understanding. 7
This general admiralty rule applies not only to actions
for maintenance and cure but also to actions under § 33
of the Merchant Marihe Act. That law is to be liberally
construed to carry out its full purpose, which was to
enlarge admiralty's protection to its wards. Warner v.
Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 156, 162; The Arizona v. Anelich,
298 U.S. 110, 123. Being an integral part of the maritime
law, rights fashioned by it are to be implemented by admiralty rules not inconsistent with the -Act. SoconyVacuum Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S. 424, 430.
III. The Pennsylvania, Supreme Court has concluded
that in solving problems of procedural, as distinguished
from substantive, law, the law court may apply its own
doctrine; and that the locus of burden of proof presents
a procedural rather than a substantive question.
'I See the Harmon case, supra, and The Standard, 103 F. 2d 437;
Sitchon v. American Export Lines, 113 F. 2d 830; Hume v. MooreMcCormack Lines, 121 F. 2d 336. For somewhat comparable cases

Syllabus.

Much of what we have said above concerning the necessity of preserving all of the substantial admiralty rights
in an action at law is incompatible with the conclusion of
the court below. The right of the petitioner to be free
from the burden of proof imposed by the Pennsylvania
local rule inhered in his cause of action. Deeply rooted
in admiralty as that right is, it was a part of the very
substance of his claim and cannot be considered a mere
incident of a form of procedure. Central Vermont Ry.

Dunlap, 308 U. S. 208, 212; and cf. The Ira M. Hedges,
218 U. S. 264, 270. Pennsylvania having opened its
courts to petitioner to enforce federally created rights,
the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the full scope
of these rights. The cause is reversed for action not
inconsistent with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
WASHINGTON.

No. 86. Argued November 18, 1942.-Decided December 14, 1942.
An employee of a construction company, which was a contributor to
the workmen's compensation fund of the State, was employed in or
about the dismantling of an abandoned bridge over a navigable
s tream, which involved cutting steel from the bridge, lowering it to
a barge and towing or hauling the barge, when loaded, to a storage
place. He had helped to cut some steel from the bridge and, at the
time of the accident, was working on the barge, examining steel after
it had been lowered and cutting the pieces to proper lengths, -as
necessary. While so employed he fell, or was knocked, into the
stream, in which his body was found. Held:
