Opinion of the Court.

317 U. S.

Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 203, had been dismissed,
petitioner applied to reopen the proceeding or, in the
alternative, to be permitted to institute a new proceeding
under § 75. The questions for our decision are whether
the courts below erred in denying her application and
whether, at the time of her application, her right as mortgagor to redeem Alabama real estate after its sale on
foreclosure of the mortgage was such that it can be administered by the court in a § 75 proceeding.
In 1937, after respondent mortgagee had obtained a
decree of foreclosure, but before foreclosure sale, petitioner
filed a petition under § 75 seeking a composition or extension of her debts. The bankruptcy court referred the proceeding to a conciliation commissioner; petitioner filed
proposed terms of composition or extension to which respondent filed objections; the conciliation commissioner
then recommended that the offer be not approved, on the
ground that it did not contain an equitable and feasible
method of liquidating respondent's claim and of securing
petitioner's financial rehabilitation.
The court confirmed the report of the conciliation commissioner, holding that petitioner was not entitled to
amend her petition so as to proceed under § 75 (s), and
directed that the proceeding be dismissed as of January
19, 1938. Petitioner's motion for leave to appeal to. the
Circuit Court of Appeals in forma pauperis and her petition for certiorari to this Court were denied. 95 F. 2d
252; 305 U. S. 596. After the farmer-debtor proceeding
was dismissed respondent purchased the mortgaged property at a foreclosure sale, which was confirmed in April,
1938. Nearly a year later, respondent contracted to sell
the property to a third party, the contract stipulating that,
it was "subject to the statutory right of redemption following foreclosure if any exists."
Alabama law allows to the mortgagor a two-year redemption period after foreclosure sale. . Title 7, § 727,

Opinion of tile Court.

Code of Alabama, 1940. On March 11, 1940, oa day before the expiration of this period,1 petitioner filed her
application in the bankruptcy court. It referred to her
prior § 75 proceeding, alleging that her property had not
been fully administered in that proceeding and that she
was entitled to further relief, especially in the light of the
changed conditions and interpretation of the Act (obviously a reference to the decision in John Hancock Ins. Co.
v. Bartels, 308 U. S. 180, decided December 4, 1939). She
accordingly prayed that the case be reopened and reinstated. In the alternative she asked that, if she were
entitled only to file a new petition, then her former schedules should be deemed a part of her petition, and she
offered to pay such filing fees as the statute requires.
The district court thought that even though the dismissal of the original proceeding was erroneous under the
rule subsequently announced in the Bartels case, there
were no circumstances sufficient to persuade the court, in
the exercise of its discretion, that the proceeding should
be reopened upon an application filed more than two
years after it had been dismissed. The court accordingly
denied the application. 34 F. Supp. 374. The Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 125 F. 2d
1003. We granted certiorari, post, p. 608, the questions
raised being of importance in the administration of the
Bankruptcy Act.
We do not differ with the conclusion of both courts
below that it was within the sound discretion of the
bankruptcy court to deeline to reopen the original order
of dismissal. A motion to reopen a proceeding may not
properly be substituted for an appeal from its decision.
See Wayne Gas Co. v. Owens Co., 300 U. S. 131, 135;
Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., ante, pp. 153'Petitioner contends that on March 11, 1940, nearly six weeks of
the period of redemption remained. We find it unnecessary to determine the correctness of this contention.

154. But the dismissal of the original proceeding and
denial of the application to reopen it were not bars to a
new proceeding under § 75 to secure whatever relief the
Act would afford with respect to petitioner's remaining
interest in the mortgaged property. We find no intimation in the language and purposes of the Act that an unsuccessful earlier proceeding would preclude a new petition
so long as the farmer retains an interest which could be
administered in a proceeding under § 75.
.Respondent argues that under Alabama statutes and
decisions 'the statutory right of redemption after foreclosure is defined as a "personal privilege" rather than as
"property or property rights" (Title 7, § 743), and hence
is not within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court in
a farmer-debtor proceeding. But § 75 prescribes its own
criteria for determining what property interests may be
brought within the jurisdiction of the court. In the interpretation and application of the Bankruptcy Act as in the
case of other federal statutes, federal not local law applies.
Prudence Corp. v. Geist, 316 U. S. 89, 95 and cases cited.
It is for the bankruptcy court to determine, by reference
to the provisions of the bankruptcy statute, what rights
created by state law-regardless of the characterization
which may be applied to them by state statutes and decisions-are within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy
court. United States v. Pelzer, 312 U. S. 399, 402-03.
. Under § 168 of Title 47 of the Alabama Code of 1940,
the purchaser at foreclosure sale is entitled to a deed immediately upon making the purchase and the deed conveys
to him full legal title subject only to the right of redemption. By §§ 727 and 743 of Title 7, the mortgagor retains
:a right of redemption, which is "not subject to alienation,"
save as it may be transferred or assigned to an assignee
who may redeem. Estes v. Johnson, 234 Ala. 191, 174 So.
632; Crawford v. Horton; 234 Ala. 439, 444, 175 So. 310.

over the debtor's "right or the equity of redemption where
the period of redemption has not or had not expired."
Wright v. Logan, 315 U. S. 139, 142; and see State Bank
of Hardinsburgv. Brown, ante, pp. 138-140. Looking at
the scope and purpose of § 75, we think petitioner's interest in the mortgaged property, whether it be denominated
a property right or a privilege of redemption, is an interest
intended to be subject to the court's jurisdiction and is
capable of administration in a farmer-debtor proceeding.
See Mangus v. Miller, ante, p. 178.
It follows that petitioner's right of redemption was within the jurisdiction of the court; that she was entitled to
initiate a new proceeding for the administration of the
property in farmer-debtor proceedings, and to ask that her
petition and schedules be allowed to stand as the petition
and schedules in such a proceeding.
