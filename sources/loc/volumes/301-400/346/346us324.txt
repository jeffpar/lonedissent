PER CURIAM.

The motion for reconsideration of the question of the

Court's power to vacate MR.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS'

stay order

and hear oral argument is denied.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK

dissents.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER

desires that it be noted that

he too would deny the motion to reconsider the power of
this Court to review MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS' order to stay
the execution, but not because he thinks the matter is
free from doubt. See his dissenting opinion in Ex parte
Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 590, in connection with Lambert v.
Barrett, 157 U. S. 697, and Carper v. Fitzgerald, 121
U. S. 87.
