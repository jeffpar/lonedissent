No. 1, Misc., June 15 Special Term, 1953.

Decided June 15, 1953.

The Rosenbergs had been sentenced to death for conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act of 1917, and the time of execution had
been fixed for the week of June 15, 1953. As the Court was about

writ of habeas corpus and stay of execution. Later that afternoon,
the Court met in Special Term pursuant to a call by THE CHIEF
JUSTICE having the approval of all the Associate Justices. All
Members of the Court were present. Held: Leave to file petition
for an original writ of habeas corpus denied.

John F. Finerty submitted the motion for petitioners.
With him on the motion was Emanuel H. Bloch.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to file petition for an original writ
of habeas corpus is denied.

Statement of

FRANKFURTER,

directly that Congress has given the Court authority to
transfer such an application to an appropriate district
court. 28 U. S. C. § 2241. I do not favor such a disposition of this application because the substance of the
allegations now made has already been considered by the
District Court for the Southern District of New York and
on review by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Neither can I join the Court in denying the application
without more. I would set the application down for
hearing before the full Court tomorrow forenoon. Oral
argument frequently has a force beyond what the written
word conveys.
