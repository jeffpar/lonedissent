APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 534. Argued March 27, 1939.-Decided April 17, 1939.
1. The Court raises sua sponte the question whether jurisdictional
amounts were in controversy in the District Court. P. 588.
2. When several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in a
single suit, the amounts involved can not be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements; jurisdiction as to each separate
controversy depends upon the amount involved in that controversy.
P. 589.
3. When several plaintiffs assert separate and distinct demands in one
suit, a general allegation in the bill that the amount involved in the
litigation is in excess of $3,000 and a finding of the District Court
that the amount involved in the suit exceeds the jurisdictional
amount, give no indication that the amount in controversy with
respect to the claim of any single plaintiff exceeds the jurisdictional
amount, and are insufficient to show that the District Court had
jurisdiction of the cause. P. 589.
4. The amount in controversy in a suit to restrain illegal imposition
of fees or taxes is the amount of the fees and" taxes which would
normally be collected during the period of the litigation. P. 589.
5. The question whether the jurisdictional amount was involved in
the District Court is determined by the record of that court, which
can not be supplemented by affidavits filed in this Court. P. 590.
6. A suit by several plaintiffs, each bound to establish the jurisdictional
amount with respect to his own claim, should,be dismissed as to
those who fail to do so. P. 590.
7. The States have constitutional authority to exact reasonable fees
for the use of their highways by vehicles moving interstate; and
for that purpose they may classify the vehicles according to the
character of the traffic and the burden it imposes on the State by

584

306 U. S.

that use, and charge for the use a fee not shown to be unreasonable
or excessive. P. 593.
8. Such classification is a legislative act and is presumed to be supported by facts known to the legislature, unless facts judicially
known or proved preclude that possibility. P. 594.
9. In passing upon the validity of such a classification, the function
of the court is to determine whether it is possible to say that the
legislative decision is without rational basis. This is equally the
case where the classification, which is one which the legislature was
competent to make, is applied to vehicles using the state highways
in interstate commerce. P. 594.
10. The Califorina "Caravan" Act of 1937 defining "caravaning" as
the transportation of any vehicle operated on its own wheels, or
in tow of q motor vehicle, for the purpose of sale, exacts two license
fees, each of $7.50, for a six month's permit to "caravan" a vehicle
on the state highways. One of the fees is declared to be to reimburse the State for expense incurred in administering police regulations pertaining to the operation of vehicles moved pursuant to
such permits, and pertaining to public safety upon the highways as
affected by such operation; the other is declared to be compensation for the privilege of using the public highways. Vehicles moving
wholly within either of two zones, which are approximately the
northern and southern halves of the State, are excepted from the
operation of thd statute. Held:
(1) That the tax is not an unconstitutional burden on interstate
commerce, nor an infraction of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to one engaged in the distinct business of bringing motor care into the State
for sale, in extensive caravans or convoys composed largely of cars
coupled in twos, each pair in control of a single driver. Cf. Morf
v. Bingaman, 298 U. S. 407. Pp. 594-595.
The evidence shows that coupled cars, under control of a single
driver, subject the highways to increased wear and tear because
of their tendency to skid and sway on curves" and in passing other
traffic, and that the lengh of the caravans and the inefficiency and
irresponsibility of the drivers, casually employed, increase traffic
congestion and the inconveniences and hazards of autom9bile traffic.
These circumstances have caused the State to make increased provision for the policing of the traffic.
(2) One engaged in this class of highway traffic has no ground
or status to complain of the discrimination involved in exacting the
fees where cars are transported into the State for sale singly and

CLARK v. PAUL GRAY, INC.
583

Opinion of the Court.

not where they move singly intrazone or enter the State not for
purposes of sale. P. 595.
(3) No unconstitutional discrimination results from failure to
apply the statute to cars that move for sale intrazone in caravans,
it appearing that cars in that class are driven relatively short distances, over highways of more than two lanes, as distinguished from
caravans coming from without the State, which move for long distances over two-lane highways in mountain districts; that such
intrazone caravans or convoys as there are consist of two to four
ears; that coupling is negligible; that each car is in charge of a
regularly licensed driver; and that such intrazone movement is subject to other licensing and taxing provisions, the differences between
which and the exactions here in question may bear a fair relation
to the differences in thp burden of the traffic for which the State
must provide. P. 596.
(4) The legislature having made its classification by the establishment of zones, in the light of special conditions in the State, courts
are not free to set aside its determination unless they can say that
it is without any substantial basis. P. 596.
(5) The complainant has not sustained the burden of proving,
and the evidence does not show, that the fees exacted by the
statute are excessive, for the purposes indicated. P. 600.
23 F. Supp. 946, reversed.

infringes the due process or equal protection clauses of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
This is an appeal under §§ 238 (3), 266 of the Judicial
Code; 28 U. S. C. §§ 345 (3), 380, from a final decree of
the district court for southern California, three judges
sitting, enjoining appellants, officers of the State of California, from enforcing the license and fee provisions of
Chapter 788, p. 2253, California Statutes of 1937. Gray
v. 1[n4els, 23 F. Supp. 946.1
The statute, known as the Caravan Act, was enacted
as a substitute for the Caravan Act of 1935, c. 402, Cal.
Stat. 1935, held invalid in Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290, as
an infringement of the commerce clause. "Caravaning"
.is defined in § 1 of the present Act as the "transportation
of any vehicle . . . operated on its own wheels, or in tow
of a motor vehicle, for the purpose of selling or offering
the same for sale . . . within or without this State."
Sections 4, 5 and 6 exact in lieu of all other fees two license fees, each of $7.50, for a six-months permit for
caravaning a vehicle on the state highways. One of these
is "to reimburse the State for expense incurred in administering police regulations pertaining to the operation of
vehicles moved pursuant to such permits and to public
safety upon the highways as affected by such operation";
the other is declared to be "compensation .for the privilege
of using the public highways." Section 8 excepts from the

of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or
collection of any tax imposed by or pursuant to the laws of any State
where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in
equity in the courts of such State." Section 2 of the Act excludes

enactment.

operation of the statute vehicles moving wholly within
either of two zones which are approximately the northern
and southern halves of the state. Other sections of the
Act make provision for the issuance of licenses and the
collection of fees. Section 12 provides for the collection
of fees by seizure and sale of vehicles transported in violation of the Act, and § 13 prescribes criminal penalties
for violation.
Appellees, numerous individuals, copartnerships and
corporations, joined in bringing the present suit against
appellants, state officers charged with the duty of enforcing the Act, alleging, that each appellee had driven and
would in the course of business drive automobiles into
California for the purpose of sale. They prayed an injunction restraining appellants from collecting the fees
and enforcing the provisions of the statute in aid of their
collection. The district court's findings state that the
amount involved in the action is in excess of the sum of
$3,000; that each of appellees, in the course of business
of selling motor cars, purchases cars previously registered
in other states and "caravans" them into the State of
California; that cars for sale are often moved between
points in a state zone; that the operation of cars in
caravans does not create an additional hazard or a traffic
problem necessitating special policing of the caravans
and that the caravaning of cars does not create undue
wear and tear on the highways of the state; that the fees
charged are excessive and bear no relation to the added
expense to the motor vehicle department of policing the
highways of the State of California; and that they are
disproportionate to other taxes or license fees charged by
the state for the use of the highways. The court concluded that the statute discriminated against interstate
commerce, deprived appellees of their property without
due process, and denied to them equal protection of the
laws, in that it applies only to those using the highways

for the transportation of motor vehicles for the purposes
of sale and does not apply to other persons using the
highways under comparable circumstances.
Appellants assail here the findings of fact of the court
below on which it predicated its conclusion of unconstitutionality, and insist that upon the evidence there is no
basis for the conclusion that the fees exacted are excessive
or that there is discrimination against interstate commerce or a denial of equal protection or due process.
JURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT COURT.

A motion of appellants in the court below to dismiss
the bill of complaint for want of the jurisdictional amount
was withdrawn, and the jurisdiction of the district court
is not challenged here. But on the argument, it appearing doubtful whether the "matter in controversy" exceeded "the sum or value of" $3,000, § 24(1) of the Judicial Code; 28 U. S. C. § 41 (1), we raised the question
whether the jurisdictional amount was involved, as was
our duty. Mansfield, C. & L. M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111
U. S. 379, 382; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co.,
282 U. S. 10, 13; St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red
Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283, 287, note 10. The bill of complaint alleges generally that "the amount involved in this
litigatiQn is in excess of Three Thousand Dollars
($3,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs." But it is
plain that this allegation is insufficient to satisfy jurisdictional requirements where there are numerous plaintiffs having no joint or common interest or title in the
subject matter of the suit. As the bill of complaint shows
on its face, and as the findings establish, each appellee
maintains his own separate and independent business,
which is said to be affected by the challenged fees. No
joint or common interest of appellees in the subject
matter of the suit is shown. Cf. Gibbs v. Buck, 307
U. S, 66.

CLARK v. PAUL GRAY, INC.
583

Opinion of the Court.

It is a familiar rule that when several plaintiffs assert
separate and distinct demands in a single suit, the amount
involved in each separate controversy must be of the
requisite amount to be within the jurisdiction of the district court, and that those amounts cannot be added together to satisfy jurisdictional requirements. Wheless v.
St. Louis, 180 U. S. 379; Rogers v. Hennepi County, 239
U. S. 621; Pinel v. Pinel, 240 U. S. 594; Scott v. Frazier,
253 U. S. 243. The general allegation in the bill of complaint that "the amount involved in this litigation is in
excess of" $3,000 and the finding of the court that "the
amount involved in the within action" exceeds the jurisdictional amount, give no indication that the amount in
controversy with respect to the claim of any single plaintiff exceeds the jurisdictional amount and are insufficient
to show that the district court had jurisdiction of the
cause. Pinel v. Pinel, supra.
Examination of the record shows that only in the case
of a single appellee, Paul Gray, Inc., is there any allegation or proof tending to show the amount in controversy.
As to it the bill of complaint alleges that "it causes to be
caravaned into the said state . . . approximately
one hundred fifty (150) automobiles each year." This
allegation is supported by evidence that this appellee is
regularly engaged in the business and tending to show
that its volume exceeded that amount when the act went
into effect July 2, 1937. Since the amount in controversy
in a suit to restrain illegal imposition of fees or taxes is
the amount of the fees or taxes which would normally be
collected during the period of the litigation, Healy v.
Ratta, 292 U. S. 263, we cannot say, upon this state of
the record, that jurisdiction was not established as to
appellee Paul Gray, Inc.
We ignore affidavits filed here for the purpose of supplementing the record by showing the amount in controversy as to another appellee. While it has been the prac-

tice of this Court to receive affidavits for the purpose of
establishing its own appellate jurisdiction under statutes
prescribing that a specified amount in controversy is prerequisite to the appeal, Williamson v. Kincaid, 4 Dall. 20;
Rush v. Parker, 5 Cranch 287; Roura v. Philippine
Islands, 218 U. S. 386; see Red River Cattle Co. v. Needham, 137 U. S. 632, that procedure is inapplicable here.
Our review of the action of the district court in assuming
jurisdiction is confined to the record before the district
court. Henneford v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 303
U. S. 17.
Proper practice requires that where each of several
plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdictional amount
with respect to his own claim, the suit should be dismissed
as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is
involved.2 Otherwise an appellate court could be called
on to sustain a decree in favor of a plaintiff who had not
shown that his claim involved the jurisdictional amount,
even though the suit were dismissed on the merits as to
the other plaintiffs who had established the jurisdictional
amount for themselves. Although it appears that such a
result could not follow here, we think it better practice to
dismiss the suit for want of the jurisdictional amount as
to all appellees except Paul Gray, Inc. See Rih v. Lambert, 12 How. 347; Ex parte Baltimore & Ohio Railroad
Co., 106 U. S. 5; Hassall v. Wilcox, 115 U. S. 598. Cf.
Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233.

DISCRIMINATION.

Apart from appellees' insistence that the fees are an
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce because
excessive, the substance of their contention is that the
statute discriminates between automobiles transported
into the state singly and those similarly transported intrazone, for which no fee is charged, and also that the
statute discriminates between those cars driven by appellees in caravans and those similarly driven wholly within
either of the state zones, for which no fee is charged.
In Morf v. Bingaman, 298 U. S. 407, we had occasion
to consider the validity of a fee or tax exacted by New
Mexico for the transportation into the state of any motor
vehicle for the purpose of sale within or without the
state. It there appeared that the plaintiff, with others,
was engaged in transporting motor cars on their own
wheels in caravans across the State of New Mexico for
the purpose of sale, and that their transportation for that
purpose had resulted in the creation of a distinct class of
motor vehicle traffic of considerable magnitude. In the
course of this business second-hand cars purchased at
points in the east are assembled in caravans, which are
driven as such to the point of sale in California. Large
numbers of the cars are coupled in twos, each two in
charge of a single driver who operates the forward car
and controls the movement of both by the use of the
mechanism and brakes of one. The drivers of caravans,
except two or three regularly engaged, are casually employed and serve without pay or for small compensation
in order to secure transportation to the point of destination. We said, page 411-412:
"The legislature may readily have concluded, as did the
trial court, that the drivers have little interest in the
business or the vehicles they drive and less regard than

Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

drivers of state licensed cars for the safety and convenience of others using the highways. The evidence supports the inference that cars thus coupled and controlled

frequently skid, especially on curves, causing more than
the usual wear and tear on the road; that this and other
increased difficulties inthe operation of the coupled cars,
and the length of the caravans, increase the inconvenience
and hazard to passing traffic. . . There is ample support for a legislative determination that the peculiar
character of this traffic involves a special type of use of
the highways, with enhanced wear and tear on the roads
and augmented hazards to other traffic, which imposes
on the state a heavier financial burden for highway maintenance and policing than do other types of motor car
traffic. We cannot say that these circumstances do not
afford an adequate basis for special licensing and taxing
provisions, whose only effect, even when applied to interstate traffic, is to enable the state to police it, and to
impose upon it a reasonable charge, to defray the burden
of this state expense, and for the privilege of using the
state highways."
The State of California has found it expedient to adopt
licensing provisions for this class of traffic and to exact
the fees specified in the statute for the use of its highways
and the expense of policing. That this peculiar type of
traffic occurs in large volume between eastern points and
points in California, and that there is basis for the legislative judgment that the traffic imposes special burdens
on the use of the state highways for which a special
charge may be made, are abundantly supported by the
record. The parties have stipulated that fifteen thousand
automobiles are brought into the state for sale annually.
Of these, from 80 to 90 per cent. come in caravans or
convoys, and of the cars so moving one-half are coupled
together in twos. It further appears by stipulation that
the caravans or convoys are made up of from nineteen to
twenty-five cars.

CLARK v. PAUL GRAY, INC.
583

Opinion of the Court.

There is much evidence in the record indicating that
it is the long haul traffic in cars for sale in California
which tends to produce the movement in large caravans
or convoys in order to save expense of transportation,
and which in turn tends to impose special burdens on the
state in connection with the use of its highways, calling
for the imposition of regulations and fees different from
those applied to other types of motor car movement.
Without repeating what was said more at length of like
traffic in Morf v. Bingaman, supra, the evidence in the
present case shows that coupled cars, under control of a
single driver, subject the highways to increased wear and
tear because of their tendency to skid and sway on curves
and in passing other traffic, and that the length of the
caravans and the inefficiency and irresponsibility of the
drivers, casually employed, increase traffic congestion and
the inconveniences and hazards of automobile traffic.
These circumstances have caused the state to make increased provision for the policing of the traffic. It is true
that the district court found that the practice of caravaning creates no additional traffic hazard, nor any undue
wear and tear on the highways. But in this we think
that its determination was not only contrary to the evidence, but went beyond the judicial province.
'It is no longer open to question that the states have
constitutional authority to exact reasonable fees for the
use of their highways by vehicles moving interstate,

p. 72, and that for that purpose they may classify the
vehicles according to the character of the traffic and the

Revenue Comm'n, supra.
The classification of the traffic for the purposes of regulation and fixing fees is a legislative, not a judicial, function. Its merits are not to be weighed in the judicial
balance and the classification rejected merely because the
weight of the evidence in court appears to favor a different standard. Cf. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley,
302 U. S. 292, 299. The determination of the legislature
is presumed to be supported by facts known to it, unless
facts judicially known or proved preclude that possibility.

v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S. 177, 191-192; United States
v. CaroleneProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153-154. Hence,
in passing on the validity of the present classification,
it is not the province of a court to hear and examine evidence for the purpose of deciding again a question which
the legislature has already decided. Its function is only
to determine whether it is possible to say that the legislative decision is without rational basis. This is equally
the case where the classification, which is one which the
legislature was competent to make, is applied to vehicles
using the state highways in interstate commerce. South
Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra, 187
et seq. The legislature must be assumed to have acted
on information available to courts, and where, as here,
the evidence, like that discussed in Morf v. Bingaman,
supra, shows that it is at least a debatable question
whether the traffic in caravans involves special wear and
tear of the highways and increased traffic hazards requiring special police control, decision is for the legislature and not the courts. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville,

supra; South CarolinaHighway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros.,
supra.
Appellee Paul Gray, Inc., so far as appears, caravans
its cars for sale in California from Detroit, Michigan, and
St. Joseph, Missouri. Its cars, like those of the other
appellees, move in caravans of from nineteen to twentyfive cars. It does not appear, nor is it contended, that
this appellee transports any cars singly. From what has
been said it is evident, as was decided in Morf v. Bingaman, supra, that cars moving in caravans of the type described constitute a special class of traffic which may be
taxed or charged for differently from other classes without
infringing the equal protection clause.
The argument that the statute denies equal protection
to appellees because it exacts fees for cars transported
into the state for sale singly but none for cars which move
similarly intrazone or for those which enter the state not
for the purposes of sale, ignores the actual circumstances
in which the statute is applied to appellees, as shown by
the record, and seeks to take advantage of an alleged
discrimination which, if it exists, does appellees no harm.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not require classification for fees, more than for taxation, to follow any particular form of words. If that adopted results in the
application of the exaction to a class which may be separately charged without a denial of equal protection, those
within the class cannot complain that it might have
been more aptly defined or that the statute may tax
others who are not within the class. See Patsonev. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138, 144; Silver v. Silver, 280 U. S.
117, 123; Morf v. Bingaman, supra, 413.
It is the practice of transporting automobiles for long
distances over the highway for purpose of sale which has
given rise to the practice of moving them in caravans.
The use of automobiles for other purposes, or for pleasure,
does not have that result. The classification of the stat-

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.

306 U. S.

ute, in its practical application, embraces and is constitutionally applicable to cars moving in caravans, the
class of traffic in which appellee Paul Gray, Inc., engages
and on which it is alone taxed. One form of discrimination of which it complains is that fees are exacted for cars
driven into the state singly for sale but not for those
driven singly to market intrazone or singly from without
the state for other purposes. Appellee does not show
that it belongs to either class, and so far as the traffic in
which it participates is properly taxed, it cannot complain
of the imposition of the charge on a business which it does
not do.
So far as appellees complain that no fee is exacted for
cars which move for sale intrazone in caravans, different
considerations apply. As we have said, it is the long haul
of cars for sale which has produced motor vehicle caravans and has made them a special class for the purposes
of regulation and imposition of fees. It was for the legislature to consider and decide whether the actual conditions which prevail in the state, affecting movement of
cars for sale, eliminate or so reduce the burden of the
caravan traffic on the highways as to call for a different
classification of the short haul traffic for the purposes of
regulation and fees. The legislature having made its
classification by the establishment of zones, in the light
of special conditions in the state, courts are not free to set
aside its determination unless they can say that it is without any substantial basis. Carley & Hamilton v. Snook,
281 U. S. 66, 73; Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring,
supra;Sproles v. Binford, 286 U. S. 374; Hicklin v. Coney,
sup. a; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Public Service
Comm'n, 295 U. S. 285.
The trial court found that cars are often moved in convoys in Zone 1, which includes the metropolitan area of
Los Angeles, and it thought this sufficient to establish an
unlawful discrimination without consideration of the

CLARK v. PAUL GRAY, INC.
583

Opinion of the Court.

other conditions affecting the intrazone traffic. The evidence establishes, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the
movement intrazone of cars for sale in convoys similar
to that of appellees is negligible and that the principal
sources of cars for sale moving intrazone are the assembly
plants of automobile manufacturers located in or near the
metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Being new cars, the bulk of them, shipped interstate or
to distant points intrastate, move by rail, water, or truck.
Most of those which move on their own wheels are driven
relatively short distances, seventy-five miles or less, in
the metropolitan area over highways of more than two
lanes, as distinguished from caravans coming from without the state, which move for long distances over twolane highways in mountain districts. The proportion
driven singly does not appear. Such convoys or caravans
as there are usually consist of two or three cars. The evidence discloses no case of more than four. Coupling is
negligible. Each car is in charge of a regularly employed
and licensed driver. The intrazone movement is subject
to other licensing and taxing provisions of the state law,
and no showing is made that the differences in fees or
taxes exacted from the two classes of traffic do not bear
a fair relationship to the differences in the burden of the
traffic for which the state must provide.
The legislature could reasonably have concluded that
the wear and tear and injury to the highways from driving coupled cars intrazone was negligible, and that the
relatively short distances which cars are driven in twos
or threes, the character of the highways used, and the
difference in the class of drivers, taken together, eliminate
from the intrazone traffic or so substantially reduce the
burden imposed by traffic like that of appellees moving
interstate or interzone as to require, in fairness, a different classification for the purpose of fees charged for the
use of the highways. We cannot say that that conclusion

Opinion of the 'Court.

306 U. S.

is without support or infringes the principles which we
have repeatedly recognized as defining the power of the
states, in the absence of Congressional action, to classify
vehicles or traffic for the purposes of regulating use of
the highways by vehicles moving interstate. If the classification with respect to a matter remaining within state
control, despite the commerce clause, is otherwise valid,
it is not any the less so because it affects interstate commerce. See South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell
Bros., supra, 191-192, and cases cited. As the state has
authority to charge a reasonable fee for the use of its
highways, and as the classification of the traffic which the
state has made for the purpose of fixing the fees is valid,
the only remaining question is whether the fees which it
has fixed must be deemed excessive.
REASONABLENESS OF THE FEES.

In Ingels v. Morf, supra, the $15 fee charged under the
California Act of 1935 for driving a car into the state for
purpose of sale was contested as excessive. There the
statute declared that the fee was "intended to reimburse
the State treasury for the added expense which the State
may incur in the administration and enforcement of this
Act, and the added expense of policing the highways over
which such caravaning may be conducted, . . ." and
the automobile owner assumed and by proof sustained
the burden of showing that the charge made for the precise purposes defined by the statute was excessive. We
accepted the evidence as establishing that the cost of issuing caravan permits was about $5 per car and as supporting the finding of the trial court that the cost of policing
did not exceed $5 a car. And we concluded that the total
cost of administration and policing was substantially less
than the $15 fee charged.
Here a fee of $7.50 is collected for administration and
enforcement of the Act and a fee of like amount is charged

for the use of the highways. Appellees have offered no
proof that either of the fees is too large, although the
burden rested upon them to show that the fees were excessive for the declared purposes. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra, 624; InterstateBusses Corp. v. Blodgett, 276
U. S. 245, 251; Morf. v. Bingaman, supra, 410; Ingels v.
Morf, supra, 296. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Washington, 300 U. S. 154, is not to the contrary.
Appellants, without abandoning their position that the
burden of proof rests on appellees, offered evidence to
show that the costs of administration and policing proved
in Ingels v. Mor!, supra, were incomplete. Due to the
nature of the case much of the proof is inexact and speculative. But there is evidence that thirty-nine officers devoted part or all of their time to enforcing the 1937 Act.
The expense of operating their automobiles and motorcycles is considerable; an increased burden is imposed
upon the personnel of the border police stations; and
some increase in clerical force and in expenditures for
stationery and miscellaneous items has been required.
Investigations of attempted evasions increase the unit
cost above that of other types of traffic. The total of
these added expenses, as computed by appellants at about
$133,000 annually, .certainly approximates the amount of
tfie revenue derived from the fees. The aggregate of the
fees collected during eleven months for 14,000 cars at
$7.50 each is $105,000. Appellees do nothing to challenge
this evidence, and they point to no specific errors in the
estimates or computation upon which appellants calculate the costs.
The state is not required to compute with mathematical precision the cost to it of the services necessitated by
the caravan traffic. If the fees charged do not appear to
be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered,
we cannot say from our own knowledge or experience that
they are excessive. Kane v. New Jersey, supra, 168;

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

InterstateBusses Corp. v. Blodgett, supra, 251, 252; Morf
v. Bingaman, supra; Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. State
Revenue Comm'n, supra; see Patapsco Guano Co. v.
North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 354; McLean & Co. v.
Denver & Rio Grande R. Co., 203 U. S. 38, 55; Interstate
Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S. 183, 186. Appellees
have failed to sustain the burden of proof that either of
the fees is excessive for the purpose for which it is
collected.
The trial court seems to have thought as appellees
argue, that unreasonableness of the fees was established
by proof that the same fees are not imposed on other
classes of traffic. But since,, as we have seen, there is
basis for the classification of the traffic, there is basis for
a difference in -fees charged the different classes. Hendrick v. Maryland, supra; Interstate Busses Corp. v.
Blodgett, supra. Appellees have laid no foundation for
any contention that there are not compensating differences in the traffic comparable to the difference in fees, or
for impeaching the legislative judgment that those specified are fairly related to the traffic to which they are
applied.
The cause will be reversed with instructions to the district court to dismiss the case as to appellee Paul Gray,
Inc., on the merits, and to dismiss as to the other appellees
for want of jurisdiction.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLAcK is of the opinion that the case
should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction as to all the
appellees.
