KEIFER & KEIFER v. RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORP. AND REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL CREDIT CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 364.

Argued January 31, 1939, February 1, 1939.-Decided
February 27, 1939.

1. A Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, chartered by the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation by authority of ยง 201 (e) of
the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, and which
under that statute is government-financed and managed and empowered to make loans to farmers and stockmen for agricultural
purposes or for raising and marketing livestock-held subject to
suit. Pp. 392, et seq.
Neither the statute nor the charter -explicitly rendered the Credit
Corporation amenable to suit; but among the corporate powers
granted the Finance Corporation by the Act creating it was authority "to sue and be sued, to complain and to defend, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, state or federal."
2. Whether a governmental corporation is endowed with the Government's immunity from suit depends upon the congressional pprpose in creating it. P. 388.
Immunity is not necessarily to be inferred from the fact that the
corporation is doing the Government's work or from the omission of
the conventional sue-and-be-sued clause from its charter.
3. Liability to suit of Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations,
chartered through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, is to
be inferred from the numerous instances in which Congress, when
creating other corporations for purposes not relevantly different
from those of the Credit Corporations, has expressly included
authority to sue and be sued, This uniform practice reveals a

definite policy which should be given hospitable scope. Failure to
include express authority to sue and be sued in the exceptional case
of the Credit Corporations is explained by an assumption on the
part of Congress that that authority would pass to them from the
Reconstruction Corporation already endowed with it. P. 390.
4. Recovery against a Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation for
damages resulting from its negligence in failing to provide proper
care for livestock delivered to it under a contract of bailment, may
be had in contract. P. 394.
5. In the light of recent congressional legislation, liability of a government corporation empowered generally "to sue and be sued" is
not confined to suits sounding only in contract. P. 396.
97 F. 2d 812, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 305 U. S. 588, to review the affirmance of a
judgment of the District Court (22 F. Supp. 918) dis-

missing on demurrer an action for damages against the
two federal corporations above named. The question
brought up by the certiorari concerns only the claim
advanced for the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation that it is immune from suit.
Mr. Ernest B. Perry, with whom Mr. Robert Van Pelt

was on the brief, for petitioner.
Congressional intent that the "Regional" be subject to
suit is expressed by selection of a corporation itself spbject
to suit to form the "Regional." Casper v. Regional
Agricultural Credit Corp., 202 Minn. 433.
Such intent is also manifested by the direction that the

"Regional" be formed as a corporation.

Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554; The Lake
Monroe, 250 U. S. 246, 249; cf. The Western Maid, 257
U. S. 419, 433. There is no distinction between suits
against he Government and suits against the property of
the U, Al States. Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U. S. 508,
512; Carr v. United States, 98 U. S. 433; Eastern Tranp.
Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686; United States

U. S. 656, 659; Price v. United States, 174 U. S. 373, 375376.
Congress has not expressly subjected regionals to suit
either in the statute, its history, or in the charter.
Immunity can not be destroyed by the mere inference
from the suability of R. F. C. Moreover, the fact that
Congress authorized creation of regionals by R. F. C. instead of by the Farm Credit Administration or some other
government agency not subject to suit does not support
such an inference, because there is no particular or special
relation between the power of R. F. C. to create regionals
and its power to sue and be sued. There is no more reason to infer that Congress intended that this attribute of
suability should pass from R. F. C. to regionals than to
infer that any of the other powers of R. F. C., such as its
power to create regionals, passed to regionals.
The general rule that a grant of corporate existence implies liability to suit has no application to corporate
instrumentalities of the Federal Government which are
immune from suit unless this sovereign immunity is
abandoned by statute clearly and expressly and not by
implication. The presumption of immunity from suit
(Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675, 686)
and the sovereign character of this immunity forbid the
view that the mere corporate form of the government
instrumentality implies that Congress intended to subject
it to suit.

KEIFER & KEIFER v. R. F. C.
381

Argument for Respondents.

In cases relied on by petitioner the corporations were
incorporated under statutes containing express provisions
for suability (Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Fleet Corp., 258
U. S. 549) or the Government was merely an incorporator
or stockholder in a corporation formed under general laws
giving the corporation power to sue and be sued. United
States Bank v. PlantersBank, 9 Wheat. 904.
Nothing in the business which regionals were directed
to transact and nothing in the present transaction indicates that Congress intended that regionals, engaged in a
public and governmental activity, should be subject to suit.
The petitioner's argument that, even in the absence of
an expressed intent, the sovereign's intent to waive immunity from suit may be inferred from the type of activity involved, whether governmental or proprietary, may
be applicable to instrumentalities of a state government,
but has no application to instrumentalities of the Federal
Government which engage only in governmental activities
and activities incidental thereto. Helvering v. Gerhardt,
304 U. S. 405, 411; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves,
299 U. S. 401, 408; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., 255
U. S. 180, 211; Osborn v. United States Bank, 9 Wheat.
738. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, 295 U. S. 229,
distinguished.
Congress has not subjected Regional to suit in tort.
A judgment against Regional would compel it to pay
out a sum of money from the public funds in the Treasury
of the United States. Such a judgment would have bhe
same effect as if it were rendered directly against the
United States for the amount specified. The jurisdiction
of a court over such an action is governed by the same
rule which determines the court's jurisdiction over a suit
against the Government itself. Smith v. Reeves, 178
U. S. 436, 439.
The present case is an action for tort, and does not rest
upon a contract, express or implied. An action will not

lie against the United States for the misfeasance or nonfeasance of its officers or agents. Gibbons v. United
States, 8 Wall. 269, 274; Langford v. United States, 101
U. S. 341, 345; Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163,

v. United States, 198 U. S. 229, 234; Peabody v. United
States, 231 U. S. 530, 539.
The statutory liability to suit must be regarded as confined to matters within the scope of the corporate powers
of the government agency-not unauthorized wrongs
upon individuals. Lyle v. National Home, 170 F. 842;
Overholserv. National Home, 68 Ohio St. 236. The rule
of the National Home cases has recently been applied to
actions in tort against the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, in Henson v. Eichorn, 24 F. Supp. 842; Prato v.
Home Owners' Loan Corp., 24 F. Supp. 844; contra, Herman v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., 120 N. J. L. 437;
Pennel v. Home Owners' Loan Corp., 21 F. Supp. 497;
and see Posey v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 93 F. 2d 726.
In England it is settled law that corporations established by the Government for governmental purposes,
deriving their funds entirely from the Government, are
"servants of the Crown," and "that the presence or absence of incorporation made no difference to the proposition that the heads of government departments are not
responsible for the [tortious] acts of subordinates."
Roper v. Commissioners, [1915], 1 K. B. 45, 52.
The legislature does not consent to actions in tort
against a state governmental corporation, merely by conferring upon the corporation the power to sue and be sued.

381

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Court took this case for review because an important question of federal law called for settlement, particularly in view of a conflict between the court below and
the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Casper v. Regional
Agricultural Credit Corp., 202 Minn. 433; 278 N. W.
896. The question is whether a Regional Agricultural
Credit Corporation, in the circumstances presently to be
stated, is immune from suit.
On July 21, 1932, Congress enlarged the powers of the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation (hereafter called
"Reconstruction") established early that year, Act of
January 22, 1932, c. 8, 47 Stat. 5, by authorizing it, among
other things, to create regional agricultural credit corporations "in any of the twelve Federal land-bank districts."
Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, ยง 201
(e), c. 520, 47 Stat. 709, 713. Each corporation was to
have a paid-up capital of not less than $3,000,000 to be
subscribed for by Reconstruction, was to be managed by
appointees of Reconstruction, and was empowered to
make loans to farmers and stockmen for agricultural purposes or for raising and marketing livestock. Accordingly, on September 10, 1932, Reconstruction chartered
the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation of Sioux
City, Iowa (hereafter called "Regional"). Regional, in
due exercise of its powers, entered into so-called cattlefeeding contracts, whereby it undertook to provide sufficient feed and water for livestock with appropriate security for rendering these services. Failure through negligence to provide proper care for cattle delivered under
this arrangement, with resulting damage to the livestock,
is the basis of this suit brought by petitioner, plaintiff
below, against Reconstruction and Regional. Both de-

fendants demurred on several grounds, of which challenge
to the jurisdiction of the court is alone pertinent here.
The District Court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the suit. 22 F. Supp. 918. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding for Reconstruction because its
control of Regional had been transferred by Executive
Order (No. 6084, dated March 27, 1933, effective May
27, 1933) to the Farm Credit Administration prior to the
alleged cause of action, and for Regional because it was
found immune from suit. 97 F. 2d 812. Certiorari was
granted, directed solely to the latter issue. 305 U. S.
588.
The starting point of inquiry is the immunity from
unconsented suit of the government itself. As to the
states, legal irresponsibility was written into the Eleventh
Amendment; as to the United States, it is derived by
implication. Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 321.
For present purposes it is academic to consider whether
this exceptional freedom from legal responsibility rests
on the theory that the United States is deemed the institutional descendant of the Crown, enjoying its immunity but not its historic prerogatives, cf. Langford v.
United States, 101 U. S. 341, 343, or on a metaphysical
doctrine "that there can be no legal right as against the
authority that makes the law on which the right depends." Kawananako v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353.
But. because the doctrine gives the government a privileged position, it has been appropriately confined.1
Therefore, the government does not become the conduit of its immunity in suits against its agents or instrumentalities merely because they do its work. United
States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 213, 221; Sloan Shipyards
'See Professor Borchard's bibliography in (1934) 20 A. B. A. J.
747, 748, and the collection of authorities in Judge Mack's opinion in
The Pesaro, 277 F. 473, rev'd, 271 U. S. 562.

Opinion of the Court.

v. U. S. Fleet Corp., 258 U.' S. 549, 567. For more than
a hundred years corporations have been used as agencies
for doing work of the government. Congress may create them "as appropriate means of executing the powers
of government, as, for instance, . . . a railroad corporation for the purpose of promoting commerce among the
States." Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U. S.
525, 529. But this would not confer on such corporations legal immunity even if the conventional to-sueand-be-sued clause were omitted. In the context of
modem thought and practice regarding the use of corporate facilities, such a clause is not a ritualistic formula
which alone can engender liability like unto indispensable
words of early common law, such as "warrantizo" or "to
A and his heirs," for which there were no substitutes and
without which desired legal consequences could not be
wrought. Littleton, Tenures (Wambaugh ed.) ยงยง 1, 733.
Congress may, of course, endow a governmental corporation with the government's immunity. But always
the question is: has it done so? Federal Land Bank v.
Priddy, 295 U. S. 229, 231. Cf. Helvering v. Gerhardt,
304 U. S. 405, 411-412n. This is our present problem.
Has Congress endowed Regional with immunity in the
circumstances which enveloped, its creation? It is not
a textual problem; for Congress has not expressed its
will in words. Congress may not even have had any consciousness of intention. The Congressional will must
be divined, and by a process of interpretation which, in
effect, is the ascertainment of policy immanent not
merely in the single statute from which flow the rights
and responsibilities of Regional, but in a series of statutes utilizing corporations for governmental purposes
and drawing significance from dominant contemporaneous opinion regarding the immunity of governmental
agencies from suit.

OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

Because of the advantages enjoyed by the corporate
device compared with conventional executive agencies,
the exigencies of war and the enlarged scope of government in economic affairs have greatly extended the use
of independent corporate facilities for governmental
ends.2 In spawning these corporations during the past
two decades, Congress has uniformly included amenability to law. Congress has provided for not less than
forty of such corporations discharging governmental
functions, and without exception the authority to-sueand-be-sued was included.' Such a firm practice is partly

an indication of the present climate of opinion which has
brought governmental immunity from suit into disfavor,
partly it reveals a definite attitude on the part of Congress which should be given hospitable scope.4 It is
noteworthy that the oldest surviving government corporation-the Smithsonian Institution-has several
times been in the law courts, even in the absence of explicit authority and although the general feeling regard457, 458; Federal Housing Administrator, 49 Stat. 684, 722; Veterans

This list does not include, of course, the government corporations
chartered under general state or District of Columbia incorporation
laws. Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Fleet Corp., supra.
Mr. Justice Holmes, on Circuit, gave pioneer expression to inferences to be drawn from legislative policy. "A statute," he wrote in
Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32 (C. C. A. 1st), "may indicate
or require as its justification a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely
to occur to the mind. The Legislature has the power to decide what
the policy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its will, however indirectly, that will'should be recognized and obeyed. The
major premise of the conclusion expressed in a statute, the change of
policy that induces the enactment, may not be set out in terms, but
it is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see
what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we
shall go on as before." See also, Taft, C. J., in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344, 385-389; Sutherlafid, J., in

ing governmental immunity was very different in 1846
from what it has become in our own day. 9 Stat. 102.
Smithsonian Institute v. Meech, 169 U. S. 398; SmithsonianInstitute v. St. John, 214 U. S. 19.

Only two instances have been brought to the Court's
attention in which Congress has nof explicitly rendered
its recent corporate creations amenable to suit. These
are the Regionals and the Federal Savings and Loan
Associations. 49 Stat. 128, 132-134. It is significant
that neither of these classes of corporations was the direct emanation of Congress or the offspring of a general
incorporation law under Congressional authority. Sloan
Shipyards v. U. S. Fleet Corp., supra. Each was to come

into being through an organ that had theretofore been
created by Congress.. We'put the Federal Savings and
Loan Associations to one side, because they are not now
before the Court.' But the circumstances attending the
origination of Regional make it manifest that it was
within the considerations that have uniformly led Congress to make its immediate corporate creatures subject
to suit. The genesis, functions, and affiliations of Regional all negative the assumption that in its operations
it was to be without the law.
Reconstruction is the parent of Regional. When creating it, Congress gave Reconstruction various general
corporate powers including authority "to sue and be
sued, to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal." 47 Stat. 5, 6. When
later Congress authorized Reconstruction to create these
Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations, it did so by
5 It is to be noted that the progenitor of thesg Associations-the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board-is not itself a corporation. But
see Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Fleet Corp., supra, in which the Fleet
Corporation was found subject to suit although Congress authorized
its creation through the President.

Opinion of the Court.

outlining in a single, section of a comprehensive statute
the broad scope of this added power for Reconstruction.
47 Stat. 709, 713.0 Congress naturally assumed that the
general corporate powers to which it had given particularity in the original statute establishing Reconstruction
would flow automatically to the Regionals from the
source of their being. Such, certainly, has been the practical construction of the Regional Agricultural Credit
Corporations in the instinctive pursuit of their enterprise.
See, e. g., Hallenbeck v. Regional Agricultural Credit
Corp., 47 Ariz. 477; 56 P. 2d 1041; Regional Agricultural
Credit Corp. v. Elston, Prince & McDade, 183 So. 91
(La.). Cf. Leuris v. Regional Agricultural Credit Corp.,
92 F. 2d 1008 (C. C. A. 10th). To imply for Regionals
a unique legal position compared with those corporations
to whose purposes Regional is so closely allied,7 is to infer
Congressional idiosyncrasy. There is a much more sensible explanation for the failure of Congress to bring Regional by express terms within its emphatic practice not
to confer sovereign immunity upon these government
corporations.' Congress had a right to assume that the
characteristic energies for corporate enterprise with which
'Section 201 (e) of the statute, providing for Regional Agricultural
Credit Corporations, covers less than half a page of a fifteen-page
statute.
'See, e. g., Federal Land Banks, 39 Stat. 360, 363; Joint Stock
Land Banks, 39 Stat. 360, 374; Federal Intermediate Credit Banks,

48 Stat. 344, 345; National Mortgage Associations, 48 Stat. 1246,
1253. Congress itself recognized the identity of purpose in these
various corporations. 48 Stat. 267, 268. Note, too, that Production

a few months previously it had endowed Reconstruction
would now radiate through Reconstruction to Regional.
To give Regional an immunity denied to more than
two score corporations, each designed for a purpose of
government not relevantly different from that which occasioned the creation of Regional, is to impute to Congress a desire for incoherence in a body of affiliated enactments and for drastic legal differentiation where policy
justifies none. A fair judgment of the statute in its entire setting relieves us from making such an imputation
of caprice.
The legal position of Regional is, therefore, the same
as though Congress had expressly empowered it "to sue
and be sued." The scope of this liability remains to be
explored.
Regional claims immunity in any event because Congress has not subjected it to suit "in tort." It is assumed that the present action is not one upon a contract, express or implied, and, therefore, outside the purview of "to sue and be sued." The premise is not valid,
nor does the conclusion follow.
The transaction which gave rise to the controversy was
a bailment of livestock for hire, and the cause of action
lack of reasonable diligence by the bailee. Ever since
the fifteenth century, according to Maitland, there were
"actions against bailees for negligence in the custody of
goods entrusted to them, and here also it was necessary
to allege an assumpsit"-the having undertaken to do
something. Maitland, Equity, Lecture VI, pp. 362, 363;
Maitland, The Forms of Action at Common Law, Lecture VI, pp. 68, 69. That Regional's failure properly to
feed and water the livestock entrusted to it by the cattle-feeding contract was not a wrong disassociated from
carrying out the very transaction which brought it into
existence, is evident from the recognized liability of the
United States itself as lessee and bailee even under the

KEIFER & KEIFER v. R. F. C.

Opinion of the Court.

explicit restrictions of the Court of Claims Acts.8 Both
this Court and the Court of Claims have sustained actions not dissimilar from the present They have recognized that the breach of implied duty of a lessee "not
to commit waste, or suffer it to be committed," United
States v. Bostwick, 94 U. S. 53, 68, and of a bailee not to
neglect "to exercise ordinary care and skill," Gulf Transit
Co. v. United States, 43 Ct. Cl. 183, 199, are duties that
have their source in contract even though the guilty
agents may be merely tort-feasors. To be sure, the common law fiction of waiving the tort and suing in assumpsit cannot be used as an evasion of the limited liability
created by the Court of Claims Acts. Bigby v. United
States, 188 U. S. 400; United States v. Minnesota Investment Co., 271 U. S. 212, 217. But where the wrong
really derives from an undertaking, to stand on the undertaking and to disregard the tort is not to invoke a
fictive agreement. It merely recognizes a choice of procedural vindications open to the injured party.
To assume that Congress in subjecting these recently
created governmental corporations to suit meant to enmesh them in these procedural entanglements, would do
violence to Congressional purpose. When it chose to do
so, Congress knew well enough how to restrict its consent
to suits sounding only in contract, even with all the controversies in recondite procedural learning that this
might entail. It did so with increasing particularity in
the successive Court of Claims Acts. 10 Stat. 612; 24
Stat. 505; 28 U. S. C. ยงยง 41 (20), 250 (1). In the light
of these statutes it ought not to be assumed that when
'The Act of February 24, 1855 (10 Stat. 612), establishing the
Court of Claims allowed suit for claims "upon any contract, express
or implied . . ." The Act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. 505) allowed
suits for claims "upon any contract, express or implied . . . or for
damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort.
." See 28 U. S. C. ยงยง 41 (20), 250 (1).

Opinion of the Court.

306 U. S.

Congress consented "to suit" without qualification, the
effect is the same as though it had written "in suits on
contract, express or implied, in cases not sounding in
tort." No such distinction was made by Congress, and
no such interpolation into statutes has been made in cases
affecting government corporations incorporated under
state law or that of the District of Columbia.' There is
equally no warrant for importing such a distinction here.
To do so would make application of a steadily growing
policy of governmental liability contingent upon irreleyant procedural factors. These, in our law, are still
deeply rooted in historical accidents to which the expanding conceptions of public morality regarding governmental responsibility should not be subordinated.
Congress has embarked upon a generous policy of consent for suits against the government sounding in tort
even where there is no element of contract. It has sanctioned suits for patent infringement, 36 Stat. 851, provided for compensation for the disability or death of a
government employee "while in the performance of his
duty," 39 Stat. 742,' authorized payment for damage to
property by the Army Air Service. 41 Stat. 109. These
and .other public statutes and many private bills were
founded on considerations thus generalized in a Report
of the Senate Committee on Claims:
"In other words, it may be said that Congress has recognized the general liability of the Government within
maximum amounts for the negligence of officers and employees of the United States, but the machinery for determining that liability is defective and results in overburdening the Claims Committee of Congress and Congress itself with the consideration of tort liability claims
and with injuries to the claimants.
9 The cases are collected in Thurston, Government Proprietary
Corporations (1935) 21 Va. L. Rev. 351, 378, et seq.

KEIFER & KEIFER v. R. F. C.

Opinion of the Court.

"This proposed legislation is designed to relieve the situation by utilizing the machinery of the Accounting Office
and judicial branches of the Government in the assistance of Congress." Senate Report No. 1699, 70th Cong.,
2d Sess., p. 4. See also Senate Report No. 658, 72d Cong.,
1st Sess., p. 3.
Acting on these views, Congress passed a general court
of claims bill, which, however, at the close of the session
failed of enactment by President Coolidge's pocket-veto.
H. R. 9285, 70th Cong., 2d Sess.; 70 Cong. Rec. 4836.10
Congress has thus clearly manifested an attitude which
serves as a guide to the scope of liability implicit in the
general authority it has conferred on governmental corporations to sue and be sued. We should be denying the
recent trend of Congressional policy to relieve Regional
from liability. This compels us to reverse the judgment
of the court below.
Reversed.
That objections to the administrative features of the bill were
the probable reasons for the veto is indicated by a memorandum of
Attorney7General Sargent, for which see McGuire, Tort Claims
against the United States (1931) 19 GEo. L. J. 133, 134, 135.
