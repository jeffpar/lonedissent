In its final opinion in the Quanah case it said: "... . we
have again carefully reviewed the opinion in the Wichita
Royalty Co. et al. v. City National Bank of Wichita Falls
case, . . . dccided by this court on the same day the
case at bar was originally decided. . . . We are satisfied
with our opinion in the Wichita Royalty Company case
as explained by our opinion on rehearing in that case."
127 Tex. 407, 421, 422. As there is no contention that
the opinion of the Texas court in this case has in any
other respect been modified by the Quanah or any other
case in the Texas Supreme Court, we do not discuss other
parts of the opinion below which it is argued fail to follow
the opinion of the state court.
We think that the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Texas in the present case has not been modified by the
Quanah case and must be accepted as stating the law of
Texas; and that it affords the appropriate guide for the
District Court so far as it may be applicable to the facts
which have been developed on the trial there. As the
court below properly directed the remand for a stateinent of findings and conclusions of law under the equity
rule, the decree will be affirmed but the proceedings in
the District Court will be in conformity to this opinion.
Affirmed.

REVENUE, v. R. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO.
CERTIORARI

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 329. Argued January 6, 1939.-Decided January 30, 1939.
1. Section 22 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, defining gross income,
was so general in its terms that an interpretative administrative
regulation letermining whether it included gain from the resale
by a corporition of its own stock was appropriate. P. 114.

of the income tax no gain or loss is realized by a corporation from
the purchase or sale of its own stock. This administrative construction of sections of the revenue acts defining gross income had
been uniform since at least 1920. May 2, 1934, before the 1929
tax of the corporate taxpayer herein had been finally determined,
the Treasury adopted an amendment to Article 66 subjecting to
tax any gain derived by a corporation from the sale of its own
shares where it "deals in its own shares as it might in the shares
of another corporation." Hold:
(1) The ascertainment of Lain by the corporation for the taxable
year 1929 is to be determined in conformity to the regulation then
in force and not by the amendment. P. 115.
(2) The regulation in force in the taxable year 1929 must be
taken to have been approved and to have been given the force
of law by Congress. P. 115.
(3) Section 605 of the 1928 Act did not authorize the Treasury
to repeal the rule of law that existed during the period for which
the tax was imposed. P. 116.
(4) The reenactment of § 22 (a) in the Revenue Acts of 1936
and 1938, without more, may not be taken as sanction by Congress
of a retroactive application of the amended regulation. P. 117.

sale of its own shares constitutes gross income within the
meaning of § 22 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1928.1
The respondent, a New Jersey corporation, on occasion
between 1921 and 1929, purchased its own Class B common stock for reasons of policy, such as the elimination
of a very large single holding, the broadening of the ownership of the stock, and the support of the market to protect the investments of employe shareholders. This
stock was resold from time to time. While held it was
treated as treasury stock and the cost of it was entered
in the accounts as "Investments in Non-competitive
Companies." The books showed no increase or reduction
of capital stock on account of purchases or sales. During 1929 the company sold shares acquired in that and
prior years for a sum which exceeded cost by $286,581.21,
which amount was entered in the books as a cash item
and added to surplus. In its income tax return for 1929
the company listed this gain under the caption "Other
Items of Non-Taxable Income," as "Profit R. J. R.
Stock."
The Conmissioner determined a deficiency in the tax
paid for 1929 involving items not here in controversy
and the company appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals
where those items were adjusted. Before the case was
closed the Commissioner by amended answer alleged that
the taxpayer's net income should be increased by the
amount of the "net profit realized ... through trafficking
in Class B common stock of the . . . Company," and
claimed a resulting deficiency. He based his claim upon
Treasury Regulation 74, Article 66, as amended by a
Treasury decision of May 2, 1934,- which states "where a
corporation deals in its own shares as it might in the
shares of another corporation, the resulting gain or loss

is to be computed in the same manner as though the
corporation were dealing in the shares of another."
The Board, after finding the facts in detail, sustained
the Commissioner.3 The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's ruling.4 Because of asserted conflict
we granted the writ of certiorari. 5
Section 22 (a) is: "General definition.-'Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from
salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of
whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or
sales, or dealings in ,property, whether real or personal,
growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in
such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain
or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any
source whatever." Section 62 directs the Commissioner,
"with the approval of the Secretary" of the Treasury, to
"prescribe and publish all needful rules and regulations
for the enforcement of this title." Article 66 of Treasury
Regulations 74, promulgated under the Act of 1928, so
far as material, is: "If . . . the corporation purchases
any of its stock and holds it as treasury stock, the sale of
such stock will be considered a capital transaction and
the proceeds of such sale will be treated as capital and
will not constitute income of the corporation. A corporation realizes no gain or loss from the purchase or sale
of its own stock."
Petitioner contends that, as Congress must be taken
to have exercised its constitutional power to the fullest
extent in laying the tax, § 22 (a) should be held to include the gain realized from sales of a corporation's own

stock, and the quoted regulation cannot restrict the scope
of the statutory definition. The respondent replies that
such gain is capital gain and not income, as is demonstrated by the theory and practice of accounting 6 and by
court decisions. 7 The court below found it unnecessary
to decide this issue, holding that whether the increment
is income is at least a debatable question and the regulation was, therefore, proper as an interpretation of the
meaning of the section. We agree that § 22 (a) is so
general in its terms as to render an interpretative regulation appropriate.8
The administrative construction embodied in the regulation has, since at least 1920, been uniform with respect
to each of the revenue acts from that of 1913 to that of
1932, as evidenced by Treasury rulings and regulations,
and decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals.' In the

meantime successive revenue acts have reenacted, without alteration, the definition of gross income as it stood
in the Acts of 1913, 1916, and 1918.10 Under the established rule Congress must be taken to have approved the
administrative construction and thereby to have given it
the force of law.
The petitioner concedes that if nothing further appeared he would be bound to apply the statute in conformity to the regulation. He asserts, however, that the
amendment adopted by the Treasury May 2, 1934, while
this cause was pending before the Board, is controlling.
By the amendment Article 66 is made to read: "Whether
the acquisition or disposition by a corporation of shares
of its own capital stock gives rise to taxable gain or deductible loss depends upon the real nature of the transaction, which is to be ascertained from all its facts and
circumstances ...
"But where a corporation deals in its own shares as it
might in the shares of another corporation, the resulting
gain or loss is to be computed in the same manner as
though the corporation were dealing in the shares of
another. .

.

. Any gain derived from such transactions is

subject to tax, and any loss sustained is allowable as a
deduction where permitted by the provisions of applicable statutes."
Petitioner urges that the amendment operates retroactively and governs the ascertainment of gross income
for taxable periods prior to the date of its promulgation,
and, further, since Congress has reenacted § 22 (a) in the
Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, it has approved the regu10See R. A. 1913, § II, B, 38 Stat. 167; R. A. 1916, § 2 (a), 39

lation as amended. We hold that the respondent's tax
liability for the year 1929 is to be determined in conformity to the regulation then in force.
Section 605 of the Revenue Act of 1928 provides that
"In case a regulation or Treasury decision relating to the
internal-revenue laws is amended by a subsequent regulation or Treasury decision made by the Secretary or by
the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary,
such subsequent regulation or Treasury decision may,
with the approval of the Secretary, be applied without
retroactive effect." " It is clear from this provision that
Congress intended to give to the Treasury power to correct misinterpretations, inaccuracies, or omissions in the
regulations and thereby to affect cases in which the taxpayer's liability had not been finally determined, unless,
in the judgment of the Treasury, some good reason required that such alterations operate only prospectively.
The question is whether the granted power may be exercised in an instance where, by repeated reenactment of

the statute, Congress has given its sanction to the existing
regulation.
Since the legislative approval of existing regulations by
reenactment of the statutory provision to which they appertain gives such regulations the force of law, we think
that Congress did not intend to authorize the Treasury to
repeal the rule of law that existed during the period for
which the tax is imposed. We need not now determine
whether, as has been suggested,12 the alteration of the
existing rule, even for the future, requires a legislative
declaration or may be shown by reenactment of the
statutory provision unaltered after a change in the ap1 45 Stat. 874.

Somewhat similar provisions were contained in

earlier acts. See Revenue Act of 1921, § 1314, 42 Stat. 314; Revenue
Act of 1926, § 1108 (a), 44 Stat. 114.

plicable regulation. As the petitioner points out, Congress has, in the Revenue Acts of 1936 and 1938, retained
§ 22 (a) of the 1928 Act in haec verba. From this it is
argued that Congress has approved the amended regulation. It may be that by the passage of the Revenue
Act of 1936 the Treasury was authorized thereafter to
apply the regulation in its amended form. But we have
no occasion to decide this question since we are of opinion
that the reenactment of the section, without more, does
not amount to sanction of retroactive enforcement of the
amendment, in the teeth of the former regulation which
received Congressional approval, by the passage of successive Revenue Acts including that of 1928.
The judgment is
