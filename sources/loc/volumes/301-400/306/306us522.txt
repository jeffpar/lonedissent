for the obligations of the transferor. £. 528.
2. A transfer by one Pennsylvania corporation to another of its assets
and francbises, in accordance with the above-cited Act of Pennsylvania, held tantamount to a merger, and that the transferee, in

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Edwin M. Sturtevant, with whom Mr. Clyde T.
Warren was on the brief, for respondent in No. 487.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases present the question whether, under the
Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928,1 a Pennsylvania corporation may deduct unamortized bond discount and expense
in connection with redemption of the bonds of a subsidiary, all of whose assets it had previously acquired pursuant to local law. The court below answered this question in the affirmative. 2 By reason of a direct conflict of
decision we granted the writ of certiorari."
The respondent in No. 486 is a Pennsylvania corporation supplying electric light and power in that state and
also operating, through subsidiaries, a system which serves
communities in Pennsylvania and Maryland. It filed
consolidated returns for itself and its subsidiaries for 1927
and 1928. During 1928 the company retired certain
bonds of Pennsylvania corporations which were formerly
subsidiaries whose obligations the taxpayer had assumed
when it. took over their assets by transfers effected pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of April 29,
1874, as amended and supplemented.' When these obligations were redeemed there existed, with respect to them,
unambrtized discount and expense aggregating $752,481.26, which the company in its return deducted from
gross income. The Commissioner ruled against the deduc'Revenue Act of 1926, §§ 200 (d), 212 (b), 232 and 234 (a) (1)
(2) and (4), 44 Stat. 9, 10, 23, 41-42; Revenuq Act of 1928, §§ 23
(a) (b) and (f), 41, 42, 43, 48, 45 Stat. 791, 799-800, 805, 807.

tion and determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax
The Circuit
Appeals sustained the Commissioner.'
Court of Appeals reversed the Board, holding that the
transactions whereby the taxpayer acquired the assets
and assumed the liabilities of its former subsidiaries, pursuant to the statute, constituted a merger, as a consequence of which the subsidiaries ceased to exist by operation of law whereas the taxpayer continued to exist and
became liable for the subsidiaries' debts both under contract and by operation of law. The court, therefore, held
that the unamortized discount and expense was deductible
in respect of the subsidiary's bonds.
In 1923 the respondent in No. 486 desired to erect a
generating plant for electric energy. Wishing to finance
it by a separate bond issue the respondent organized
Metropolitan Power Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary. The taxpayer purchased, guaranteed, and sold, at the same price it had
purchased, $3,250,000 of bonds of the subsidiary; purchased all of its stock and loaned it on open account
approximately $3,000,000. The Power Company held no
public franchises and, under a cntract with the taxpayer,
sold all of its electricity to the latter at a price sufficient
to enable it merely to earn the costs of operation and
other charges, including depreciation, taxes, and interest.
In 1927, pursuant to State authority, the Power Company
sold all its assets subject to its liabilities to the taxpayer,
a deficit from operations being charged against the taxpayer's surplus. At the time of the transfer the taxpayer
surrendered the stock of the Power Company for cancellation and the latter became inactive and was dissolved
in 1928. The taxpayer assumed liability for the outstanding bonds of the Power Company payment of which it

had originally guaranteed and, during 1927, called them
for redemption and redeemed, them. At the time of the
redemption there remained unamortized discount and
expense incurred in issuing the bonds aggregating $308,097.90 which the taxpayer deducted from its gross income.
The Commissioner ruled against the deduction and the
Board of Tax Appeals sustained him.' The Court of
Appeals reversed the Board, holding that, while the transaction was not consummated under the state statute it
nevertheless was under state law a de facto merger, and
the taxpayer was accordingly entitled to the deduction.
The respondent inNo. 487 is a Pennsylvania corporation operating a hydroelectric plant at Holtwood, Pennsylvania. In 1924 it desired to provide its customers with
a more adequate supply by an auxiliary steam power
plant. As its corporate powers did not permit steam generation of electricity it caused the incorporation of a
Pennsylvania company, known as Holtwood Power Company, all of whose shares were purchased and owned by
the respondent. With the proceeds of the sale of the
Power Company's stock and those of a bond issue the
steam plant was erected. This plant sold all its output
to the taxpayer which agreed, in return, topay the Power
Company's costs and expenses and an allowance for depreciation, and to pay a sum to provide for amortization
of debt, discount, and security issue expense, and the expenses attending the issue, registration and transfer of
the capital stock and bonds, all interest on bonds and
other indebtedness, and a sum sufficient to provide a net
return of eight per cent. on the Power Company's stock.
The steam plant was managed by the taxpayer's officers
and employes without compensation and was operated.

surrendered certain corporate powers so as to be in a position to effect a merger or consolidation with its subsidiary
under the Pennsylvania statutes.' Thereupon the Power
Company conveyed all of its assets and franchises to the
taxpayer pursuant to the Pennsylvania Act of 1874 as
amended, the sole consideration being the delivery to the
subsidiary of all its capital stock held by the taxpayer and
the assumption by the taxpayer of the subsidiary's indebtedness. The subsidiary ceased to exist. In 1928 the
taxpayer retired the bonds of its former subsidiary and
charged off unamortized discount and expense in respect
of them in the sum of $145,159.52 and, in its income tax
return for that year, claimed a small deduction for amortization for a portion of the year prior to the retirement,
and a deduction of the balance of the sum above mentioned as of the date when the retirement took place. The
Commissioner disallowed the deduction and determined
a. deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the
ruling.' The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
Board.
The petitioner concedes that if there has been a true
merger or consolidation whereby the identity of the corporation issuing the bonds continues in the successor and
the latter becomes liable for the debts of the former by
operation of law, the successor may deduct amortization
of discount and expense in respect of bonds issued by its
predecessor as well as unamortized discount and expense
on any of such bonds retired prior to maturity.' The

rule is not applicable upon a mere sale by one corporation of all its assets to another which assumes the lia-

bilities of the former.' °
The contention of the petitioner is that the transactions
in issue fall within the latter category. The respondents,
on the other hand, insist that, in the light of the applicable statute of Pennsylvania and the decisions of her
courts, the transactions constituted mergers in the proper
acceptation of that term. The question, then, is solely
one respecting the law of Pennsylvania.
Until the complete revision of the corporation laws of
the Commonwealth in 1933 there were but two statutes
available to corporations seeking to merge or consolidate.
The Act of April 29, 1874, § 23, supra,,so far as material,
provides that any corporation, with the consent of its
stockholders, may "sell, assign, dispose of and convey to
any corporation created under or accepting the provisions
of this act, its franchises, and all its property, real, personal and mixed, and thereafter* such corporation shall
cease to exist, and the said property and franchises not
inconsistent with this act, shall thereafter be vested in
the corporation so purchasing as aforesaid. . . ." The
Act of May 3, 1909,11 permits what it terms a merger but
what is in truth a consolidation to be effected by a joint
agreement of two or more corporations approved by the
stockholders setting forth the terms and conditions of
the merger and consolidation and providing for the organization of a new corporation to which the franchises
and property of the consolidating corporations are to be
transferred. This act contemplates the issue of letters
patent to the consolidated corporation, and the issue of
new stock by it, in lieu of that of the old. The procedure

under the Act of 1874 has repeatedly been referred to in
the decisions of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth
as the "short form" and that under the Act of 1909 as the
"long form" of merger."
Inasmuch as the transfer of the franchises and assets
is authorized by statute, it seems reasonably clear that
the transferee is, as matter of law, liable for the obligation
of. the transferor. The cases indicate that this is so. 3
The petitioner argues and the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit has held to the contrary, in reliance
on kierwine v. Mt. Pocono Light & Imp. Co., 304 Pa.
517; 156 Atl. 150. That court thought the case indicated
that the liability, if any, of the transferee was not under
the statute but was only that of a fraudulent transferee
under 13 Eliz., chap. 5. Action for a tort had been
brought against the transferor prior to a transfer under
the Act of 1874. After the conveyance the defendant filed
a suggestion that the property had been conveyed in proceedings under the Act, that the defendant had ceased
to exist, and that the action should be abated. The
plaintiff sought to substitute the transferee as defendant.
The trial court denied substitution and abated the action.
The Supreme Court held that the termination of corporate existence of the defendant under the Act of 1874
did not abate the action, but that if the plaintiff recovered
a judgment she could "levy wherever defendant's assets
liable for the judgment may be found," which seems to

us to mean no more than that the assets after the conveyance remained subject to the transferor's liabilities.
A transfer fully authorized by statute cannot be a fraudulent conveyance within the 13 Eliz.
We are of opinion that a transfer without valuable consideration, with the intent that the transferor shall, as
the statute provides, cease to exist, made in accordance
with the statute, has all the elements of a merger and
comes within the principle that the corporate personality
of the transferor is drowned in that of the transferee. It
results that the continuing corporation may deduct unamortized bond discQunt and expense in respect of the
obligations of the transferring affiliate.
A somewhat different question arises with respect to
the transfer of assets of Metropolitan Power Company.
It is admitted that this transfer was not made in accordance with the terms of the Act of 1874. No franchises
were transferred because the Metropolitan Power Company held no public franchises of any kind. The transfer
was merely of assets with the assumption of all the liabilities by the transferee. It is important to note, however, that amongst the liabilities assumed were bonds on
which the parent company vas already liable as guarantor. The court below has held, and we concur, that, under
the law of Pennsylvania, the transfer in question constituted a de facto merger, even though the transfer did
not comply with all the provisions of the Act of 1874,"
and that, as matter of law, the taxpayer would be liable
for the debts of the transferor.
Judgments affirmed.
