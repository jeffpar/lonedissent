OCTOBER TERM, 1938.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE

BLACK

306 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Respondent sued the Treasurer of Puerto Rico in a
local district court for recovery of 1927 income taxes paid
under the laws of the Island. By construction of the local
Puerto Rican statutes permitting suits for refunds, the
local district court found that no right had been granted
to sue at law for taxes voluntarily paid. The bill of
complaint was then dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,
because it disclosed that the tax in question had been paid
voluntarily and without protest. The Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico affirmed, but was reversed by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals.1
As conceded by respondent, this suit cannot be maintained unless authorized by a Puerto Rican law, because
Puerto Rico cannot be sued without its consent.! It
is also conceded that the Puerto Rican legislature is not
obligated to provide a judicial remedy for tax refunds.3
Respondent's contentions here are that the governing
statutes of the Island do authorize the present suit "either
by express language or by necessary implication," and that
the Puerto Rican courts erroneously construed the local
statutes.
Section 75 of the controlling Income Tax Act of Puerto
Rico, approved August 6, 1925,' authorizes the Treasurer
"to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, . . . and all taxes that appear to be unjustly assessed or excessive in amount, or in
'98 F. 2d 398. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico,
and its opinion on rehearing, have as yet been reported only in
Spanish. 50 D. P. R. 962, 51 D. P. R. 135.

Opinion of the Court.

any manner wrongfully collected," and requires him to

"report to The Legislature of Porto Rico at the beginning of each regular session . . . all transactions under
this section."
The courts of Puerto Rico construed § 75 to mean that
the Treasurer's refusal to refund taxes not paid under
protest is final; that the local statutes grant the courts
no jurisdiction to review this refusal; and that after the
Treasurer's report to the legislature, a voluntary taxpayer's complaint must be addressed to the legislature.
Disagreeing with this construction given the statute by
the courts of Puerto Rico, the Circuit Court of Appeals
(one Judge dissenting) found that the 1925 Act plainly
provided a resort to the courts, even in suits to recover
taxes voluntarily paid without protest.
It is necessary that we examine some of the considerations which led to the Puerto Rican courts' construction
of § 75 of the 1925 Act. For illustration, § 66 of the
Puerto Rican Income Tax Law of 19191 imposed upon
the Treasurer the duty of making tax refunds (as in § 75
of the 1925 Act), but § 66 contained an express provision
for "appeal to the courts" if a taxpayer's claim were
denied by the Treasurer.' The omission of this express
provision from § 75 and all other sections of the 1925
'Laws, 1919, p. 612, 666.

Section 66: "That the Treasurer be, and he is hereby, authorized

to remit, reimburse or make restitution for any tax or duty erroneously or unlawfully imposed or collected, as well as of the amount of
any fine collected by error or without legal authority therefor.
"That when proper claim has been made to the Treasurer of
Porto Rico for the return, reimbursement or remittal of any duties
or taxes erroneously or illegally levied or collected, as well as for the
amount of any fines collected by error or without legal authority, if
he refuses without reason to grant such a claim, the aggrieved party
may appeal to the courts of justice, following therefor the procedure
authorized and the proceedings established by Section 63 of this
Act."

Act was logically considered by the Puerto Rican courts
to be of significance in the construction of that
Act. The right of appeal to the courts contained in
§ 66 of the 1919 Law was first omitted from the 1921
Puerto Rican Law, and this led the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico to declare in the present case that "since
1921, . . . the right to bring suits for the recovery of
taxes other than those paid under protest has been
abrogated."'
Furthermore, four different sections of the 1925 Act
(57, 60, 62 and 76 (a)) constitute a statutory plan under
which a taxpayer who pays under protest is granted the
right to sue in the courts for refund. Such a taxpayer can
sue at law under these sections only if he has been denied
relief by both the Treasurer and the Board of Review and
Equalization of the Island. But these sections nowhere
expressly authorize appeal from the Treasurer to the
Board by one who paid taxes without protest. And § 76
(b), which the Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted as
authorizing suit by a taxpayer who paid without protest,
expressly prohibits suit in court "until a claim for, refund
or credit has been duly filed with . . . the Board of Review and Equalization on appeal, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations established
in pursuance thereof." (Italics supplied.) Since a voluntary taxpayer is given no express right of appeal from
the Treasurer to the Board by the "provisions of law
in . . . regard" to such appeals, he is not expressly authorized to comply with the condition precedent to right
of suit under § 76 (b). Rights denied by the statutes
could not be granted by regulations.

In addition, § 76 (b) of the 1925 Act is practically
identical in language with § 3226 of United States Revised
Statutes governing suits for refunds of United States
taxes.' But the legislature of Puerto Rico-while apparently using § 3226 as a model-omitted from 76 (b)
the clause of § 3226 reading "suit or proceeding [for tax
refund] may be maintained, whether or not such tax . . .
has been paid under protest or duress." This substantial
adoption of § 3226, omitting the clause authorizing suit
without protest, (as well as the similar omission from
the 1921 Act), could hardly represent accidental oversight,
but instead indicates a deliberate legislative purpose. °
Congress first granted local authority to the government of Puerto Rico in 1900 " and comprehensively revised the original plan in 1917.12 Both enactments manifest a congressional purpose to preserve-consistently
with our system of government-the then existing governmental practices. Laws and ordinances then in effect
and not contrary to our laws or Constitution were continued in full force, subject to alteration by the Puerto
Rican legislature or Congress. Original and appellate
local courts, their jurisdiction and procedure, were preserved by Congress, and local officials were left in office.'
And this Court has declared its unwillingness to overrule Puerto Rican tribunals upon matters of purely local
concern 14 or to decide against the local understanding
of a local matter, not believed by this Court to be clearly
wrong; 15 and a disposition to accept the construction

placed by a local court upon a local statute." and to
sustain such a construction in the absence of clear or
manifest error. 7
Taxing acts of Puerto Rico are purely local and the
traditional reluctance of this Court to overturn constructions of such local statutes by local courts is particularly
applicable to interpretations of Puerto Rican statutes by
Puerto Rican* tribunals."8 Orderly development of the
government of Puerto Rico as an integral part of our
governmental system is well served by a careful and consistent adherence to the legislative and judicial policy of
deferring to the local procedure and tribunals of the
Island.
The judgments of the Puerto Rican courts in this case
are not unsupported by logic or reason. They embody a
recognition of our constitutional division of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government.
Believing the legislature had declined to give the right
to sue to a taxpayer who computed his own tax from his
own records and voluntarily paid it without protest, the
Puerto Rican courts properly declined to read implications into a statute which they could not fairly find there.
In passing upon a previous construction of a Puerto
Rican statute by the Supreme Court of Puerto Ric6, this
Court said, "The construction adopted in Porto Rico
at least does no violence to the words of the statute; it
concerns local affairs under a system with which the court
of the Island is called on constantly to deal, and we are
not prepared, as against the weight properly attributed
to the local decision, to say that it is wrong." "9 So

In failing to uphold their construction of the local statutes, the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and

STATE TAX COMMISSION ET AL. v. VAN COTT.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF UTAH.

No. 491.

Argued March 6, 7, 1939.-Decided March 27, 1939.

1. Salaries of employees or officials of federal instrumentalities are
not immune under the Federal Constitution from taxation by the
States. Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, ante, p. 466. P. 515.
2. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah holding the salaries
of an attorney for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and
the Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, both federal
agencies, exempt from state taxation, does not rest squarely upon
the exemption in the Utah income tax law of salaries received
from the United States "for services rendered in connection with
the exercise of an essential governmental function," but appears
also to have been actuated by the doctrine that state taxation of
such salaries is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. P. 513.
3. In view of the overruling of that doctrine by Graves v. O'Keefe,
this Court vacates the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah
and remands the case to that court, in order that it may determine
whether the salaries in question are exempted by the state statute,
purely as a question of local law. P. 515.
