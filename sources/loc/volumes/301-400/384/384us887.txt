APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 81. Decided June 20, 1966.
238 F. Supp. 916, vacated as moot.

PER CURIAM.

In WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 382 U. S. 4, we affirmed
a judgment of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York insofar as there appealed
by WMCA, Inc., et al., the appellees in the present case.
Appellants in this case, Lomenzo et al., challenge other
aspects of the same judgment, and all parties now agree
that, as to those aspects, the judgment of the District
Court has been rendered moot by the actions. of the
Court of Appeals of New York in In the Matter of
Orans, 17 N. Y. 2d 107, 216 N. E. 2d 311 (1966), and
In the Matter of Orans, 15 N. Y. 2d 339,206 N. E. 2d 854,
appeal dismissed 382 U. S. 10 (1965). Accordingly,
the judgment of the District Court is vacated as moot
insofar as it concerns the issues here appealed, namely,
whether N. Y. Laws 1964, cc. 977-978, 979, 981, are violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, and ,whether the District Court was entitled, 3 rely on provisions of the New
York Constitution possibly affected by the -action of this
Court in WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U. S. 633.
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS took no part in the consideration

or doeision of this case.
