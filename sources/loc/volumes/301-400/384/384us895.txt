WHISMAN v. GEORGIA.
APPEAL FROM THE *SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 1381, Misc. Decided June 20, 1966.

221 Ga. 460, 145 S. E. 2d 499, appeal dismissed and certiorari
denied.
Reuben A. Garlandand Beryl H. Weiner for appellant.
Arthur K. Bolton, Attorney General of Georgia, and
Alfred' L. Evans, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, for
appellee.
PER CURIAM.

The motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is
dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers
whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for a writ
of certiorari, certiorari is denied.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS is of te opinion that certiorari
should be granted and the judgment reversed. He would
remand the case for a new trial, it being clear from the
record that the Principles announced in Miranda v.
Arizona, ante, p. 436, were not aPplied. He sees no
reason for discriminating against this petitioner, the
case having . come here on diiet review and being of
the same vintage as Mirandev. Arizona. See dissenting
opinion in Johnson vi New Jersey, ante, at 736.
