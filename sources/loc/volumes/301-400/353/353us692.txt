Opinion of the Court.

353 U. S.

MULCAHEY, DISTRICT DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE,
v. CATALANOTTE.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 435.

Argued March 27, 1957.-Decided June 3, 1957.

An alien who entered the United States in 1920 for permanent residence was convicted in 1925 of a federal offense relating to illicit
traffic in narcotics. At that time, there was no statute making
that offense a ground for deportation. After enactment of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, he was ordered deported
under §§ 241 (a) (11) and (d) thereof, which provide for the deportation of any alien who "at any time" has been convicted of violating any law relating to illicit traffic in narcotics. He challenged
the validity of this order in a habeas corpus proceeding. Held:
the order of deportation is sustained. Lehmann v. United States
ex rel. Carson, ante, p. 685. Pp. 692-694.
236 F. 2d 955, reversed.

Roger D. Fisher argued the cause for petitioner.

On

the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.

Louis M. Hopping argued the cause and filed a brief
for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a companion case to Lehmann v. United States
ex rel. Carson, ante, p. 685, and presents similar questions.

Respondent, an alien who entered the United States in
1920 for permanent residence, was convicted in 1925 of a
federal offense relating to illicit traffic in narcotic drugs.'
'The sale of a quantity of cocaine hydrochloride and possession and
purchase of 385 grains thereof.

MULCAHEY v. CATALANOTTE.
692

Opinion of the Court.

At that time there was no statute making that offense a
ground for deportation. He was taken into custody in
May, 1953, and, after administrative proceedings, was
ordered deported under § 241 (a)(11) and (d) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,2 which provides, inter alia, for the deportation of any alien "...
who at any time has been convicted of a violation of any
law or regulation relating to the illicit traffic in narcotic
drugs .... I
Respondent petitioned the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for a writ of habeas corpus. The
District Court, after hearing, denied the petition. The
Court of Appeals reversed, 236 F. 2d 955, holding-principally on the basis of its earlier decision in United States
v. Kershner, 228 F. 2d 142, this day reversed by us,
sub nom. Lehmann v. United States ex rel. Carson, ante,
p. 685--that inasmuch as respondent's conviction in 1925
of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs was not a ground for
deportation prior to the Immigration and Nationality Act
of 1952, respondent had a "status" of nondeportability
2 66

Stat. 204, 8 U. S. C. § 1251.
8 Section 241 (a) (11) and (d) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1952 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
"(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported
who"(11) is, or hereafter at any time after entry has been, a narcotic
drug addict, or who at any time has been convicted of a violation of
any law or regulation relating to the illicit traffic in narcotic
drugs ....
"(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the
provisions of this section shall be applicable to all aliens belonging to
any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), notwithstanding . . . (2) that the facts, by reason of which any such alien belongs
to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), occurred prior
to the date of enactment of this Act."

353 U. S.

which was preserved to him by the savings clause in
§ 405 (a) of that Act.' We granted certiorari, 352 U. S.
915.
As we have said in Lehmann v. United States ex rel.
Carson, ante, p. 685, § 405 (a) by its own terms does not
apply to situations "otherwise specifically provided" for
in the Act. Section 241 (a) (11) and § 241 (d) specifically provide for the deportation of an alien notwithstanding that the offense for which he is being deported
occurred prior to the 1952 Act. Section 241 (a) (11)
makes an alien deportable if he has "at any time"
been convicted of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. And
§ 241 (d) makes § 241 (a)(11) applicable to all aliens
covered thereby "notwithstanding ... that the facts...
occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act."
It seems to us indisputable, therefore, that Congress was
legislating retrospectively, as it may do,' to cover offenses
of the kind here involved. The case is, therefore, "otherwise specifically provided" for within the meaning of
§ 405 (a). The Court of Appeals was in error in holding
to the contrary, and its judgment is
Reversed.
