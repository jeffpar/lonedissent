HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. HUTCHINGS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No 419.

Argued January 8, 1941.-Pecided March 3, 1941.

1. In the computation of the tax laid upon "net gifts" made during
the calendar year, § 504 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1932 provides
that "In the case of gifts (other than of future interests in property)
made to any person by the donor during the calendar year the
first $5,000 of such gifts . . shall not
be included in the
total amount of gifts made during such year." Held that where
the donor conveyed property in trust for the benefit of numerous
beneficiaries he was -entitled to separate exemptions or exclusions
of $5,000 for each beneficiary. P. 395.
The question whether the gifts to the beneficiaries were "future
interests" within the meaning of the section is not decided, not
having been presented by the petition for certiorari, but is left
open for consideration by the Board of Tax Appeals.
2. In common understanding and usage a gift is made to him upon
whom the donor bestows the benefit of his donation. P. 396.
111 F. 2d 229, affirmed.

Stat. 169, 247, the donor of property in trust for the benefit of numerous beneficiaries is entitled to a single gift tax
exemption or exclusion to the extent of the first $5,000 or
to separate exemptions of $5,000 for each beneficiary.
Sections 501 (a), 502 (1) impose for each calendar
year a tax on the net amount of the transfers "by any
individual . . . of property by gift."

By § 501 (b) the

tax applies "whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise"
and "whether the gift is direct or indirect." In the
computation of the tax laid upon "net gifts" made during
the calendar year, § 504 (b) provides "In the case of
gifts (other than of future interests in property) made
to any person by the donor during the calendar year, the
first $5,000 of such gifts . . . shall not . . . be included

in the total amount of gifts made during such year."
And § 1111, defining generally terms used throughout
the Revenue Act, provides: "(a) When used in this Act(1) The term 'person' means an individual, a trust or
estate, a partnership, or a corporation."
On December 30, 1935, the taxpayer executed a trust
indenture by which she transferred, in trust, property
of a value of approximately $145,000 for a term ending
in 1957, unless sooner terminated by the trustees, for the
benefit of her seven children, with gifts over of the share
of each child in event of the death of that child before
the expiration of the trust. The taxpayer in her gift
tax return for 1935 excluded from the taxable amount
of her gifts the sum of $5,000 for each child or a total
of $35,000. The Commissioner allowed only a single deduction of $5,000 in lieu of the seven $5,000 deductions
claimed by the taxpayer and assessed a deficiency accordingly. The Board of Tax Appeals, treating the trust
as the donee rather than -the individual beneficiaries,
sustained the Commissioner's assessment. The Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 111 F. 2d 229.
We granted certiorari, 311 U. S. 638, to resolve a conflict

of the decision below and of like decisions in other circuits, Welch v. Davidson, 102 F. 2d 100 (first circuit),;
Rheinstrom v. Commissioner, 105 F. 2d 642 (eighth circuit); McBrier v. Commissioner, 108 F. 2d 967 (third
circuit), and in the Court of Claims, Pelzer v. United
States, 90 Ct. Cls. 614; 31 F. Supp. 770, with that of
the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Ryerson, 114 F.
2d 150.
It is not doubted that separate gifts, other than of
future interests, made directly to the donees without the
intervention of a trustee entitle the donor under § 504
(b), to one $5,000 exclusion for each gift. But the Government argues that here the trustee or the trust is the
donee and as there was only a single trust there can be
only a single statutory deduction from the total amount
of the gifts. As the statute allows one deduction of the
first $5,000 for each gift "made to any person" by the
donor, the question for decision is whether in this case of
a gift in trust for the benefit of the designated beneficiaries the single trust, or each beneficiary, is the "person"
to whom the gift was made and for which the deduction,
is allowed.
The statutory definition of."person" in § 1111(a) (1) is
of little aid in answering this question. The definition
is made generally applicable to all of the sections of the
revenue act and was carried forward from earlier acts
which contained no gift tax provisions. See § 2(a) (1) of
the 1926 Revenue Act, 44 Stat. 9; § 701(a) (1) of the 1928
Revenue Act, 45 Stat. 878. The section means no more
than-that the word "person" in any section of the act in
which it occurs may be taken as meaning "trust" rather
than "individual" as the context may require. But § 504
(b), allowing the deduction in the case of each gift to
any persof when applied to gifts in trust for designated
beneficiaries, may be read as referring either to a gift to
the trust or a gift to each individual beneficiary. Hence
we must read the section in its setting of the gift-tax pro-

visions and in the light of its legislative history, to determine whether, within its meaning, the trust or each
individual beneficiary is the donee to whom-the gift is
made..
The gift tax provisions are not concerned with mere
transfers of legal title to the trustee without surrender by
the donor of the economic benefits of ownership and his
control over them. A gift to a trustee reserving to the
donor the economic benefit of the trust or "the power of
its disposition, involves no taxable gift. It is only upon
the surrender by the donor of the benefit or power reserved to himself that a taxable gift occurs, Estate of
Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U. S. 39; Rasquin v. Humphreys, 308 U. S. 54, and it would seem to follow that the
beneficiary of the trust to whose benefit the surrender
inures, whether made at the time the trust is created or
later, is the "person" or "individual" to whom the gift
is made.
But for present purposes it is of more importance that
in common understanding and in the common use of language a gift is made to him upon whom the'donor bestows
the benefit of his donation. One does not speak of making a gift to a trust rather than to his children who are its
beneficiaries. The reports of the committees of Congress
used words in their natural sense and in the sense in
which we must take it they were intended to be used in
§ 504 (b) when, in discussing § 501, they spoke of the
beneficiary of a gift upon trust as the person to whom the
gift is made. Similarly they spoke of gifts effected by
transfer of money or property to another as consideration
for the payment of money or other property to i third
person as a gift to the third person. H. Rept. No. 708,
72d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 27-28; S. Rept. No. 665, 72d
Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 39-40. It is of some significance also
that the denial by § 504(b) of the exemption in the case
of gifts of "future interests" has little scope for practical
operation unless the gifts to which the exemption applies

HELVERING v. HUTCHINGS.

include those gifts made to beneficiaries of a trust, since
it is by resort to the conveyance in trust that most future
interests are created.
Moreover, the very purpose of allowing a gift tax exemption measured by the number of donees, would be
defeated if a distinction were to be taken between gifts
made directly to numerous donees and a gift made for
their benefit by way of a single trust, and we are unable
to discern in the statute or its legislative, history any purpose to make such a distinction. While one object of
the exerption was to permit small tax free gifts, and at
the same time "to fix the amount sufficiently large to
cover in most cases wedding and Christmas gifts" without
the necessity of keeping accounts and reporting the gifts,
H. Rept. supra, 29; S. Rept. supra, 41, nevertheless the
statute extended the exemption in the specified amount
to all gifts, whether large or small, "made to any person."
In the face of an exemption thus made broadly applicable to all gifts to all donees and in the absence of some
indication of an intention to discriminate between gifts
made directly to the donees and those made indirectly
to the beneficiaries of a trust, we can hardly' assume a
purpose to favor one class of donees over the other or
find such a purpose in the words of the statutory definition of "person" which may indicate either the trust or
each individual beneficiary of the trust as the person to
whom the gift is made. Further, such an assumption
would open the way to avoid the $5,000 limitation upon
the allowed exemption, by resort to the simple expedient
of the-creation by a single donor of any number of trusts
of $5,000 each for the benefit of a single beneficiary.' A
'It was this construction of the statute by the Board of Tax
Appeals and by "several of the federal courts" which lead to the
amendment of § 504 (b) so as to withdraw the exemption in the case
of every gift in trust. See § 505 of the 1938 Act, 52 Stat. 447. S.
Rept. No. 1567, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess., p. 41.

construction so dependent upon an artificial meaning of
the words of the statute and so out of harmony with the
statutory scheme and purpose is not to be favored.
Article 11 of 79 Treasury Regulations (1933 edition),
issued under the 1932 Act, treats each gift to the beneficiary of a trust as entitled to the benefit of the $5,000
deduction unless the gift is of a "future interest" which
§ 504 (b) excepts from the exemption otherwise allowed.
Such we think is the correct construction of the statute.
It is unnecessary to consider here the question whether
a gift upon trust for impersonal, public or charitable
purposes where there are no designated or ascertainable
first beneficiaries is a gift to the trust entitled to a
single $5,000 deduction. See Hutchings v. Commissioner,
111 F. 2d 229, 231. Nor do we consider whether the gifts
to the beneficiaries here are of future interests which are
excepted from the benefit of the $5,000 deduction allowed
by § 504 (b). That question is not presented by the
petition for certiorari. But our judgment will be without
prejudice, to consideration of that question by the Board
of Tax Appeals upon the remand to it if, under the rules
and procedure governing proceedings before the Board,
the Commissioner is free to present the question there.
Affirmed.
