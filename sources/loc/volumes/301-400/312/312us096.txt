Opinion of the Court.

96

CERTIORARI, 311 U. S. 627, to review the affirmance of
a judgment sustaining a plea of the statute of limitations
in a suit by the receiver of a national bank to collect
an assessment from a stockholder.
Mr. George P. Barse, with whom Mr. Lee Roy Stover
and Miss Harriet BuCikingham were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. Earl King submitted for respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
Petitioner is the receiver of the Lee County National
Bank of Marianna, Arkansas, which in 1933 was declared
by the Comptroller of the Currency to be insolvent. On
November 6, 1935, the Comptroller assessed its shareholders fifty per centum of the par value of their shares.
The assessment was required to be paid on or before
December 13, 1935, and the receiver gave notice accordingly. As respondent failed to pay, the receiver brought
suit on December 7, 1938, in the District Court of. the
United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas to
recover the amount assessed. Respondent pleaded the
Arkansas statute of limitations which provides that such
an action must be commenced "within three years after
the cause of action shall accrue." Pope's Digest of Statutes of Arkansas (1937), ยง 8928. The District Court
sustained the plea and its judgment was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 111 F. 2d 695. Because of
a conflict of decisions we granted certiorari. See Strasburger v. Schram, Ct. App. D. C., 93 F. 2d 246; Reich v.
Van Dyke, C. C. A. 3d, 107 F. 2d 682; Haight v. First
Trust & Deposit Co., C. C. A. 2d, 112 F. 2d 572; MacPhersonv. Schram, C. C. A. 5th, 112 F. 2d 674.
The state statute of limitations is applicable. McDonald v. Thompson, 184 U. S. 71, 72; McClaine v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

Rankin, 197 U. S. 154, 158. The question is whether the
statute began to run on the date of the assessment, as
held by the court below, or on the date fixed for payment. The words "after the cause of action shall accrue"
in the Arkansas statute have their usual meaning and,
refer to "a complete and present cause of action." Holloway v. Morris, 182 Ark. 1096, 1099; 34 S. W. 2d 750,
752.
The question as to the time when there was a complete
and present cause -of action so that the receiver could
enforce by suit the liability imposed by the Comptroller's assessment is a federal question and turns upon the
construction of the assessment and the authority of the
Comptroller to make it under the applicable federal legislation.
While the assessment was made on November 6, 1935,
it was expressly made payable on or before December 13,
1935. Respondent was allowed until that date to pay
and prior thereto suit could not be maintained against
him. Hence the statute of limitations did not begin to
run until December 13, 1935, and the suit was in time.
The case of Pufahl v. Estate of Parks, 299 U. S. 217
(upon which the court below relied) is not to the contrary. The question now presented was not there involved. In that case, after the death of a stockholder
of a national bank, and after the expiration of one year
fh om the date of letters testamentary, the Comptroller
of the Currency made an assessment upon the 5ecedent's
estate. The state court, applying a state statute, had
disallowed the receiver's claim upon the assessment as
against undistributed assets in the hands of the executors, which had been inventoried within a year from the
date of letters testamentary, because the claim did not
accrue and was not presented to the probate court within
that period, but allowed the claim as to assets not inventoried within the year. We affirmed the judgment. We
said that where an assessment had been made in the de-

Opinion of the Court.

cedent's lifetime an accrued and provable debt existed
against his estate, and that if the assessment were made
after his death a claim against the funds and assets of
the estate accrued as of the date of the assessment.
Further, that the claim of the receiver, although based
upon a federal statute, could be enforced only in conformity with the law of the forum governing the recovery
of debts of like nature (Id., pp. 224, 225) and that the
non-discriminatory legislation of Illinois where the suit
was brought was controlling. We observed that the contingent obligation of a stockholder to pay an assessment
was rendered absolute by the Comptroller's action in
ordering one and that from the moment of the order of
assessment the receiver had a claim which would support
an action at common law against a living stockholder or
the executor of a deceased stockholder; that if the assessment were made after the estate had been distributed,
the receiver could recover from the distributees or heirs
if and up to the extent they were liable under the applicable local law. Id., pp. 222, 223.
In all this we were not considering or deciding the
question of the application of a statute of limitations
to a suit against a stockholder upon an assessment made
by the Comptroller where payment was not required before a specified date, prior to which no suit could be
maintained.
We find no ground for questioning the authority of
the Comptroller in making an assessment to fix a later
date for its payment. The federal legislation does not
impose or suggest any such limitation upon the exercise
of his power. 12 U. S. C. 63, 64, 191, 192. What was
done in the instant case appears to be in accord with a
practice of long standing.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court
for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.
