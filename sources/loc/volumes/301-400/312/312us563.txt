METROPOLITAN CASUALTY INSURANCE CO. v.

STEVENS

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 425. Argued February 13, 1941.-Decided March 17, 1941.
One against whom a state court issued a writ or garnishment, requiring him to make disclosure concerning his liability to judgment
debtors, applied to the state court for removal of the proceeding
to the federal court. The application was denied, whereupon the
garnishee applied to the federal court for removal, and filed in
that court a disclosure denying liability to the judgment debtor.
While the garnistlee's application was pending in the federal
court, the state court entered a default judgment against the
garnishee for failure to appear. Subsequently, the federal court
remanded the cause to the state court, which thereupon reentered
a default judgment against the garnishee. Upon review here of
that judgment, held:
1. The order of the federal court remandipg the cause to
the state- court was not reviewable directly or indirectly. P. 565.
2. Proceedings in the state court subsequent to the petition for
removal were valid if the suit was not in fact removable. P. 566.
3. The federal court's order of remand being not reviewable,
it must be assumed for the purposes of this case that the proceeding was not removable. P. 569.
4. The state court had jurisdiction to enter the default judgment, and it was for that court to determine the effect of the
disclosure filed in the federal court. P. 569.
5. In cases such as this, it is better practice for the state court,
if it be assured that the federal court will decide promptly the
question of removability, to await that decision; but its failure
so to do denies no federal right if the cause be not removable.
P. 569.
293 Mich. 31; 291 N. W. 211, affirmed.

a judgment against the petitioner. Applications to the

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the

Court.
We are asked in effect to hold invalid a default judgment eitered by a state court in a garnishment proceeding aft,r it had denied a petition for removal to a federal
distric court. The principal questions are whether we
may re3view an order of the federal district court remanding the suit to the court from which it was removed, and
whether the latter court was free to disregard a disclosure
filed in the federal court before the default judgment was
entered. From the record the following appears:
On March 8, 1939, respondent obtained a writ of garnishment from a Michigan state court requiring petitioner to appear on or before March 31 and disclose
whether it was liable to individuals against whom respondent had recovered a judgment. On March 28,
petitioner filed an application and bond in the state court
for removal of the proceeding to the proper- federal district court. On April 4, the state court denied the application. On April 10, petitioner filed in the federal district court copies of all papers on record in the state
court and its disclosure denying any liability to respondent or to the judgment debtors. The next day, respond-;
ent entered petitioner's default in the state court for
failure to appear, and notified petitioner that respondent
would move for judgment on April 17.
On April 15, petitioner notified respondent of its attempt to remove the suit notwithstanding the ruling
of the state Court. Respondent promptly moved to have
the proceeding remanded, and on the same day the dis-

trict judge granted the motion. The remand order was
filed in the state court on Apr il 17. Respondent thereupon entered petitioner's default a second time, introduced evidence, and obtained a default judgment. On
April 18, petitioner unsuccessfully moved to vacate the
judgment. Appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court followed and the judgment was affirmed. 293 Mich. 31;
291 N. W. 211. Because it involved important questions
concerning the removal statute (28 U. S. C. ยง 71), we
brought the case here. 311 U. S. 637.
Petitioner contends that the garnishment proceeding
was removable as a "separable controversy and that the
state court therefore was without jurisdiction to enter
the default judgment. Further, petitioner contends in
substance that the petition for removal when filed in the
state court deprived that court of power to proceed with
the cause, at least until the federal court had passed
upon the question of removability, and that in all events
the refusal of the state court to accord any legal effect to
the disclosure filed in the federal district court while the
petition for removal was pending there was a denial of a
federal right given by the removal statute, supra. We
cannot agree.
The case is ruled by Yankaus v. Feltenstein, 244 U. S.
127.' There we held that an order of a federal district
court remanding the cause to the state court was not
reviewable directly or indirectly, and affirmed the judg'Feltenstein and another brought suit in a state court against Yankaus on October 11, 1915. On October 16, Yankaus filed a petition
for removal in the state ";ourt,and on October 20 filed copies of all
papers on record in the state court and an answer in the federal
court. On the latter date the state court denied his petition for removal, and on October 26 entered judgment against him. On November 15, the federal court remanded the cause, and two weeks later
the state court denied a motion to vacate the judgment. The state
appellate court subsequently dismissed an appeal.

ment of the state court even though it had been secured
by default.' While the opinion does not expressly consider the effect of a petition for removal on subsequent
proceedings in the state court, the clear import of the
decision is that the proceedings are valid if the case was
not in fact removable. See Souther:n Pacific Co. v.
Waite, 279 F. 171; Commodores Point Terminal Co. v.
Hudnall, 279 F. 606, 607; First National Bank v. King
Bridge Co., 9 Fed. Cas. 882

The rule that the remand order is not reviewable
stems from ยง 28 of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. ยง 71)
and from many decisions adjusting the relationship of
state and federal courts and the scope of authority of
each in cases sought to be removed from the former to
the latter. The rule that proceedings in the state court
subsequent to the petition for removal are valid if the
suit was not in fact removable is the logical corollary of
the proposition that such proceedings are void if the
cause was removable. Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Bacon,
236 U. S. 305; Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard
Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239; Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S.

Home Life Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 19 Wall. 214; Gordon v.
Longest, 16 Pet. 97.4
When a petition for removal to a federal court is
denied by the state court, the petitioner may do one
of three things. He may object to the ruling, save an
exception, and litigate the cause in the state courts.
Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Bacon, supra; Stone v. South
Carolina, 117 U. S. 430; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v.
Koontz, 104 U. S.5; Removal Cases, 100 U. S.457; Gordon v. Longest, supra. He may remove the suit to the
federal court despite the ruling of the state court. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Koontz, supra; Kern v. Huidekoper,.103 U. S.485; Home Life Ins. Co. v. Dunn, supra.
He may proceed in both courts at the same time. Kern
v. Huidekoper, supra; Removal Cases, supra.
If the petitioner litigates the cause in the state court
and preserves an exception, he may have the order of
the state court denying his petition for removal reviewed
in the state appellate court. In proper cases he may
come here asserting a denial of his right of removal.
Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Bacon, supra; Stone v. South
Carolina, supra; Removal Cases, supra. If he removes
the cause to the federal district court despite the state
court ruling and the federal court assumes jurisdiction
over the objection of his adversary, the latter, after final
judgment, may contest this assumption of jurisdiction in
the circuit court of appeals, and in this court in proper
cases. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 169 U. S.
92; Cates v. Allen, 149 U. S.451; Graves v. Corbin, 132

Opinion of the Court.

312 U. S.

U. S. 571. If petitioner proceeds simultaneously in state
an! federal courts and both render final judgments, he
and his adversary may obtain review of the question
of removability by following respectively the courses just
outlined. Kern v. Huidekoper, supra; Removal Cases,
supra.
Petitioner is protected whichever course he elects., If
he makes timely application for removal and properly
objects to its denial by the state court, participation in
subsequent proceedings in the state court is not a waiver

of his claim that the cause should have been litigated in
the federal court. Powers v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry.
Co., supra; Removal Cases, supra; Home Life Ins. Co.
v. Dunn, supra. Compare Miller v. Buyer, 82 Colo. 474;
261 P. 659; State v. American Surety Co., 26 Idaho 652;
145 P. 1097; Ashland v. Whitcomb, 120 Wis. 549; 98 N. W.
531. If he removes the cause notwithstanding the state
court ruling, he may nevertheless resist further action
by his opponent in the state court. Kern v. Huidekoper,
supra;Removal Cases, supra.
However, the issue of removability is closed if the
federal district court refuses to assume jurisdiction and
remands the cause. Section 28 of the Judicial Code,
supra, precludes review of the remand order directly
(Kloeb v. Armour & Co., 311 U. S. 199; Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U. S. 374; City of Waco v.
U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U. S. 140; In re
Pennsylvania Company, 137 U. S. 451), or indirectly
after final judgment in the highest court of the state in
which decision could be had. McLaughlin Brothers v.
Hallowell, 228 U. S. 278; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v.
Fitzgerald, 160 U. S. 556; compare Pacific Live Stock
Co. v. Lewis, 241 U. S. 440.
Here, petitioner attempted to remove the cause, as it
had a right to do, even though the state court had denied
its petition for removal. The federal court held it was

not removable as a separable controversy and remanded it
to the state court. For the reasons already stated, we
are not at liberty to review the remand order. Consequently, we must assume, so far as this case is concerned,
that the suit was not removable. .Having made this assumption, we must conclude that the state court had jurisdiction to enter the default judgment (Yankaus v. Felterstein,244 U. S. 127; Southern Pacific Co. v. Waite, 279
F. 171), and it was for that court to determine the effect
of the disclosure filed in the federal court. Ayres v. Wis-.
wall, 112 U. S. 187; Broadway Ins. Co. v. Chicago G. W.
Ry. Co., 101 F. 507; compare Tracy Loan & Trust Co. v.
Mutual Life Ins. Co., 79 Utah 33; 7 P. 2d 279. If, in
cases like the present one, the state court is assured that"
the federal court will decide promptly the question of
removability, it is better practice to await that decision
(Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. McCabe, 213 U. S. 207;
Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Koontz, supra), but we cannot say that failure to do so is a denial of a federal right
if the cause wasnot removable.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Michigan Supreme
Court is
Affirmed.

No. 502.

Argued March 7, 1941.-Decided March 31, 1941.

1. Civil liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution, imply the
existence of an organized society maintaining public order with-.
out which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses. P. 574.
2. The authority of a municipality to impose regulations in order
to assure the safety and convenience of the people in the use of
public highways has never been regarded as inconsistent with
civil liberties but rather as one of -the means of safeguarding the
good order upon which they ultimately depend. P. 574.
