mails to defraud by the sale of securities. His argument
is that, in so far as the later act prohibits the fraudulent
sale of securities by mail, it repeals by implication the
provisions of the old mail fraud statute in so far as they
cover securities. We see no basis for a conclusion that
Congress intended to repeal the earlier statute. The two
can exist and be useful, side by side."

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 384.

Argued January 17, 1941.-Decided March 3, 1941.

1. The remedy of an employee of an interstate railway for personal
injuries suffered while he was engaged about intrastate transportation and caused by a breach of the Federal Safety Appliance
Acts, is the remedy afforded by the common or statutory law of
the State. P. 486.
2. The Federal Safety Appliance Acts create the right; the remedy is
within the State's discretion. P. 486.
3. A fixed interpretatioD of a state statute by the supreme court
of the State should be accepted by the federal courts when it
does not obviously depend altogether on a misconception of
federal law. P. 488.
4. In construing the state Workmen's Compensation Act as inapplicable to causes of action arising under the Federal Safety
Appliance Acts and in ruling that the remedy in such cases is
by action at law, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania does not

appear to have been actuated entirely by a misunderstanding of
the federal Acts. P. 489.
Confirmatory of this conclusion is the Pennsylvania statute
providing "That when a court of last resort has construed the
language used in a law, the Legislature in subsequent laws on the
same subject matter intend the same construction to be placed
upon such language," and the fact that the state court's constructions of the Compensation Act and of jurisdiction over claims
arising under the Safety Appliance Acts remain undisturbed by
the subsequent amendments of the Compensation Act. P. 491.

judgment for personal 'injuries resulting from violations
of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts.

on the brief, for petitioner.

Aubrey was on the brief, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This certiorari brings here the question as to whether
the law of Pennsylvania limits recovery under the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts to the
procedure and awards of that state's Workmen's Compensation Act in accidents where the railway employee is
engaged in an intrastate activity at the time of injury.
The suit was brought at common law in the Federal
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The employee,
petitioner here, was a citizen of Pennsylvania and the defendant was a corporation created under the laws of New
Jersey, handling transportation moving between states.
The basis of the action was respondent's violation of the
Safety Appliance Acts by failure to furnish efficient hand

brakes for a car.' This failure resulted in an injury to
petitioner in Pennsylvania. No interstate commerce was
involved. He recovered in the trial court but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on its
determination that the remedy of the petitioner lay solely
in the Compensation Act and was not cognizable at law.
We granted certiorari because of an alleged conflict on a
question of local law between the judgment below and
Miller v. Reading Company.*
No issues arise except the one upon procedure. It is
clear
that an employee injured in intrastate transportation by defective equipment of an interstate railroad
comes under the Safety Appliance Acts.' Nor is there
any longer a question as to the power of the state to
provide whatsoever remedy it may choose for breaches
of the Safety Appliance Acts.' The federal statutes
create the right; the remedy is within the -state's discretion. In this case we are to find what rentedy the State
of Pennsylvania has provided.
This Court had occasion to consider the matter of
what remedies for breach of the Federal Safety Appliance
Acts had been provided by a state in Tipton v. Atchison,
T. & S. F. Ry. Co.' The circumstances there were quite
similar to the present case. Tipton was an employee of
a railroad which was a highway of interstate commerce
and suffered injury through violation of the safety acts
while engaged within California in intrastate transpor'Act of April 14, 1910, § 2, 36 Stat. 298.

tation. ' He sought damages at common law and, after
removal to the federal court, was cast in the litigation on
the ground that his only redress lay through the California Workmen's Compensation Act. In affirming this
conclusion here, two cases of the district courts of appeal
of California were exained-Ballard v. Sacramento
Northern Railway Co.' and Walton v. Southern Pacific
Co.8 Petition for review of the two cases had been refused by the Supreme Court of California.' The Ballard case treated § 6 of the Act of April 22, 1908,10 the
jurisdictional section of the Federal Employers Liability
Act, as applicable to the cause of action under consideration, although that cause was bottomed upon the Safety
Appliance Acts. From that-premise the California court
went ahead to conclude that its Workmen's Compensation Act did not apply by virtue of § 69 (c) of the Compensation Act." That section omitted employments
governed by the acts of Congress. The Compensation
Act is the exclusive state remedy for injuries within its
scope. The Federal Employers Liability Act does give
a right of action and fix the tribunals where it may be

enforced. 2 Thus through assimilating the rights and
remedies under the Safety Appliance Acts to those under
the Federal Employers Liability Act, the California
Workmen's Compensation Act was found inapplicable.
Walton's was a similar case and it too, page 305, following Ballard, permitted the maintenance of the suit in
the state court.
This Court was of the view that the California courts
excluded these railroad employees from the benefits of
the Compensation Act "because they [the courts]
thought the Safety Appliance Acts required the State
to afford 'a remedy in the nature of an action for damages" and for that reason refused to follow their interpretation of the Compensation Act. Although the
Tipton case decided the only available California remedy
was the compensation scheme, it was indicated that "a
definite and authoritative decision" to the contrary by
the California courts would, of course, be followed."3
Tipton lost through the determination here that California had declared by its statute he must seek relief
through compensation.
In the present case, Breisch sued at common law. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment in his
favor on the ground that the Pennsylvania Workmen's
Compensation Act supplied the exclusive remedy for his
injury. To reach this conclusion, the court determined
that in Miller v; Reading Company " the Supreme Court
of Pennsylvania decided that "the Compensation Act did
not apply to Miller's case, not as a matter of statutory
construction of that Act but because it thought that the
" Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 291 U. S. 205, 215, 216,
and § 1 and § 6, 45 U. S. C. 51 and 56.
" A later decision of the Supreme Court of California is in accord
with this Court's ruling in the Tipton case. Scott v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 9 Cal. 2d 315, 323; 70 P. 2d 940.

Opinion of the Court.

proper construction of the Federal Safety Appliance Acts
required the ruling that Miller had a cause of action
under the Safety Appliance Acts, cognizable in a court
of law but not within the purview of the Compensation
Law." Reliance was placed upon the Tipton case and
Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co. 5 which support the
principle that interpretation of state statutes by state
courts under compulsion of federal law erroneously
understood does not bind federal courts.
It is not apparent to us, however, that the Miller opinion depends upon the compulsion of a misunderstanding
of. the Safety Appliance Acts. In McMahan v. Montour
Railroad Co., 8 it is true, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held the Compensation Act was the exclusive remedy for injuries to employees of interstate railroad highways, when the employees at the time of the injury were
engaged in an intrastate movement. But that case was
predicated upon an erroneous conception of the relation
of the employee to interstate commerce. It was thought
that only employees who were engaged in that commerce
at the time of the accident were covered by the Safety
Appliance Acts. 7 Nothing was said as to the tribunal
which might award relief in employments covered by the
Safety Appliance Acts. This Court's citations on reversal dealt only with the scope of the federal acts, not
with remedies under them. 8 When the question next
arose, in the Miller case, the Pennsylvania court undertook an interpretation of the scope of the coverage of
the Workmen's Compensation Act. That act provides
in § 302:
"(a) In every contract of hiring made after December
thirty-first, one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, and

in every contract of hiring renewed or extended by mutual consent, expressed or implied, after said date, it
shall be conclusively presumed that the parties have accepted the provisions of article three of this act, and
have agreed to be bound thereby, unless there be . . ."
(Article three is the compensation schedule.) There are
no exceptions to this except the customary exemptions
of domestic service or agriculture. 9 In the Miller case,
compensation coverage was refused employees of interstate roads engaged in intrastate activities in these
words:
"Our Workmen's Compensation Act gave to a board
exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings to adjudicate claims
of employees, which, by consent, express or implied, it
was agreed should be so disposed of, and, as to such cases,
jurisdiction of the courts to try and determine is ousted.
But as to demands, not arising from the ordinary relation
of employer and employee, such as the enforcement of
rights fixed by federal statute, their powers remain as if
no such state legislation was in force." 20
Though there undoubtedly were other statements in
the course of the opinion which reflect a misconception
of the state's authority over procedure for recovery under the Safety Appliance Acts, we conclude that such
misconception is not enough to call for a refusal to follow the Supreme Court's definite ruling that the state
courts were open for redress for accidents covered by the
Safety Appliance Acts.
State Tax Commission v. Van Cott," relied upon to
support the conclusion reached below, is not controlling.
In that case a direct review of the question decided by
the state court was sought here on the ground that the
state's conclusion on a matter of construction of a state

income tax statute was controlled by the decisions of this
Court on the taxability by states of salaries of federal
employees. It was not clear to us whether the state
decision was controlled by the state court's view of our
decisions or not. And, as our decisions at the time of
review here permitted a decision by the state court on the
state statute, free from federal constraint, we returned
the case for state action. In the Van Cott case we were
reviewing an application of federal law by a state court
to a solution of a state's problems. Here we have a federal court's interpretation of a long-standing state decision. Uncompleted state action, probably influenced by
decisions of this Court subsequently overruled, calls for
an opportunity for the state to adjudicate the question
for itself, while a fixed interpretation of a state statute
should be accepted by the federal courts when it does not
obviously depend altogether on a misconception of federal law.
There are other factors which forbid the conclusion
below. A Pennsylvania statute, derived from the state's
common law," provides "That when -a court of last resort
has construed the language used in a law, the Legislature
in subsequent laws on the same subject matter intend
the same construction to be placed upon such language." " Since the Miller case the compensation act
has been amended several times, 4 but the Legislature
has never attempted to override the limitations read into
it by the Miller opinion. There were comprehensive
amendments in the 1937 reenactment,2 ' more than a year

after this Court's decision in the Tipton case established
that the compensation remedy could be made exclusive,
but still the Legislature took no action. Under these
circumstances we are of the opinion that the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania of its own
Workmen's Compensation Act and of the jurisdiction
of its courts over claims arising under the Safety Appliance Act is binding upon the federal courts and should
be followed.
