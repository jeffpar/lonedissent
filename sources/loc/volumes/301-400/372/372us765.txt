ON PETITION FOR REHEARING.

No. 133.

Decided April 22, 1963.

Rehearing granted; order dismissing writ of certiorari vacated;
judgment of Court of Appeals vacated; and case remanded to
District Court for further proceedings.
Reported below: 111 U. S.?App. D. C. 294, 296 F. 2d 416.

David I. Shapiro and Sidney Dickstein for petitioner.
Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General
Douglas, Stephen J. Pollak, Alan S. Rosenthal and David

PER CURIAM.

In view of the factual contentions advanced in the petition for rehearing filed by the petitioner and in the respondents' reply thereto, the petition for rehearing is
granted and the order heretofore entered, 371 U. S.531,
dismissing the writ of certiorari is vacated. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is
remanded to the District Court with instructions to hold
a hearing and determine whether the petitioner, desiring
the presence of witnesses at his hearing, either discharged
his initial burden under the applicable regulations-by making timely and sufficient attempt to obtain their presence
or, under the circumstances and without fault of his own,
was justified in failing to make such attempt, and, if so,
whether proper and timely demand was made upon the
Air Force so that it was required to produce such witnesses
for cross-examination. Upon making such determination,
the District Court shall-thereupon enter such further order
or judgment as may be appropriate.
