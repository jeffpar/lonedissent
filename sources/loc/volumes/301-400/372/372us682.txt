v. CENTRAL

AIRLINES, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 61.

Argued February 19-20, 1963.-Decided April 15, 1963.

A suit in a Federal District Court to enforce an award of an airline
system board of adjustment, created by a contract between an
airline and a labor union pursuant to § 204 of the Railway Labor

Act and whose decisions are final and binding upon the parties,
arises out of the Railway Labor Act and is governed by federal law.

Therefore, it is (1) a suit arising under a law of the United States
of which the District Court has jurisdictjon under 28 U. S. C. § 1331,

if the jurisdictional amount is involved, and (2) a suit arising under
a law regulating commerce of which the District Court has jurisdiction under 28 U. S: C. § 1337, irrespective of the amount involved.

tiated grievances over these discharges, which were not
settled between the parties and which were presented to
the system board of adjustment, established by agreement between the union and the airline according to the
Railway Labor Act, 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U. S. C.
§§ 151-188. The four-man board of adjustment deadlocked, a neutral referee was appointed by the National
Mediation Board, and an award was then rendered ordering the individual petitioners reinstated without loss of
seniority and with back pay. Central refused to comply
and petitioners filed this suit in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Texas for enforcement
of the award.
The complaint recited the certification of the union as
the collective bargaining agent by the National Mediation
Board pursuant to an election held under the Railway
Labor Act, disclosed the execution of a collective bargaining contract with the company, and attached as an exhibit
a copy of another contract with Central establishing a
system board of adjustment. This contract stated, "In
compliance with Section 204, Title II of the Railway
Labor Act, as amended, there is hereby established a
system board of adjustment for the purpose of adjusting
and deciding disputes . . . ." Under the express terms
of the contract, "decisions of the Board in all cases properly referable to it shall be final and binding upon the
parties" and, when a neutral referee is sitting with the
board, "a majority vote of the Board shall be final, binding,
and conclusive between the Company and the Association
and anyone they may represent having an interest in the
dispute." The complaint set out in some detail the
action and decision of the system board and a copy of its
award was attached. Alleging that Central had refused
to comply with the terms of the award and that the suit

under the Railway Labor Act as set out more particularly hereinabove," petitioners requested the "enforcement of the aforesaid System Board Award .

.

. and that

judgment be entered ordering defendant to comply with
said award .

...

"

Although the gist of the complaint was that Central
was obliged to comply with the award by reason of the
Railway Labor Act, the District Court granted Central's
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that
there was no diversity of citizenship (which was not disputed) and that the case did not arise under the laws of
the United States as required by 28 U. S. C. § 1331.1 The
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed on the
authority of its previous decision in Metcalf v. National
Airlines, 271 F. 2d 817, ruling that the complaint did not
disclose "affirmatively a federally-created cause of action"
and that "this suit is nothing more than a state-created
action to construe a contract." 295 F. 2d 209. Certiorari was granted to consider the important question of
whether a suit to enforce an award of an airline system
board of adjnstment is a suit arising under the- laws of
the United States under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 or a suit arising under a law regulating commerce under 28 U. S. C.
'28 U. S. C. § 1331:
"(a) 'UJe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil
actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of
$10,000 exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.
"(b) Except when express provision therefor is otherwise made
in a statute of the United States, where the plaintiff is finally adjudged to be entitled to recover less than the sum or value of $10,000,
computed without regard to any setoff or counterclaim to which the
defendant may be adjudged to be entitled, and exclusive of interests
and costs, the district court may deny costs to the plaintiff and, in
addition, may impose costs on the plaintiff."

§ 1337.2 369 U. S. 802. We have concluded that this
question must be answered in the affirmative and that the
District Court has jurisdiction to proceed with the suit.
I.
In 1936, Congress extended the Railway Labor Act to
cover the then small-but-growing air transportation
industry. 49 Stat. 1189, 45 U. S. C. §§ 181-188. Its
general aim was to extend to air carriers and their employees the same benefits and obligations available and
applicable in the railroad industry.' But there was to
be a significant variation. The 1936 amendments made
applicable to the airlines all of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, excepting § 3, 45 U. S. C. § 153, dealing
with the National Railroad Adjustment Board; but including § 1, 45 U. S. C. § 151, containing definitions; § 2,
45 U. S. C. § 151a, the Act's statement of purposes; §§ 4
and 5, 45 U. S. C. §§ 154-155, relative to the National
Mediation Board and its functions; and §§ 7, 8 and 9,
45 U. S. C. §§ 157-159, relating to voluntary arbitration
and emergency boards. § 202, 45 U. S. C. § 182. In the
place of § 3, Congress provided in § 205, 45 U. S. C. § 185,
that the creation of a National Air Transport Board would
28 U. S. C. § 1337:
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil
action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating
commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and
monopolies."
Petitioners' complaint mentioned only § 1331, but reliance has
subsequently been placed on § 1337 as vell, since there is a dispute
concerning the existence of the jurisdictional amount required by
§ 1331. This is permissible. American Federationof Labor v. Watson, 327 U. S. 582, 589-591.

be postponed until "in the judgment of the National
Mediation Board, it shall be necessary to have a permanent national board of adjustment . . . ." Until the
establishment of the national board for the airlines industry, § 204, 45 U. S. C. § 184, required the formation of
system, group, or regional boards of adjustment:
"It shall be the duty of every carrier and of its
employees, acting through their representatives,
selected in accordance with the provisions of sections 181-188 of this title, to establish a board of
adjustment of jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may be lawfully exercised by system,
group, or regional boards of adjustment, under the
authority of section 153 of this title."
The duty imposed upon the parties to create adjustment boards to settle grievances was more than a casual
suggestion to the air industry. The original version of
S. 2496, which, as amended, became law, provided for
voluntary boards of adjustment as in the case of the railroads and extended the jurisdiction of the National
Mediation Board to minor as well as major disputes.'
But upon the suggestion of the National Mediation Board,
its jurisdiction was not expanded, and the law as finally
passed made compulsory the establishment of the adjustment boards.' Until and unless the National Mediation
Board determined to create a national board, the parties
were placed under the statutory duty of establishing and
utilizing system, group, or regional boards of adjustment
for the purpose of adjusting and deciding disputes arising
under existing contracts.
The obligation which § 204 fastened upon the carriers
and their employees cannot be read in isolation. Its true
significance must be drawn from its context as part of the

history.' See Romero v. International Term. Co., 358
U. S.354, 360.
Congress has long concerned itself 7 with mininizing
interruptions in the Nation's transportation services by
strikes and labor disputes and has made successive
attempts to establish effective machinery to resolve disputes not only as to wages, hours, and working conditions,
the so-called major disputes connected with a negotiation
of contracts or alterations in them, but also as to the interpretation and application of existing contracts, the minor
disputes of the type involved in this case. In 1920,8 the
latter category was dealt with by providing that the
parties "may"create boards of adjustment to handle these
grievances which, however, if unresolved by these boards
were to be referred to the Railway Labor Board whose
decisions were not legally enforceable. 9 The results were
highly unsatisfactory, ° and in 1926 Congress required
that "boards of adjustment shall be created by agreement." " The boards were to be composed of an equal
number of employee and employer representatives and

their decisions were to "be final and binding on both
parties to the dispute; and it shall be the duty of both
to abide by such decisions."

12

In spite of the mandate of the 1926 Act, creation of
adjustment boards did not automatically follow. Furthermore, there was no provision in the Act for breaking
deadlocks of the board, which were frequent and which
resulted in a myriad of minor disputes going unresolved.
As a result, see Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S.
711, 725-726, in 1934 the Act was amended to create the
National Railroad Adjustment Board, the divisions of
which were to hear disputes referred by either party and
"growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation
or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,
rules, or working conditions." § 3, 45 U. S. C. . § 153
First (i). In the event of deadlocks in a division, the
National Mediation Board was required to name a neutral
referee to sit with the appropriate division of the Board
to determine the case. § 3 First (1). It was provided
in § 3 First (m) that "the awards of the several divisions
of the Adjustment Board shall be stated in writing . . .
and the awards shall be final and binding upon both
parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award. . .

."

Section 3 First (p) provided

for a suit in the United States District Courts to enforce
certain awards.
While thus establishing a National Adjustment Board
with power to make final awards with the help of neutral
persons where necessary, Congress also provided in
§ 3 Second for voluntary -system boards:
"Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any individual carrier, system, or group of carriers and any class or classes of its or their employees,

all acting through their representatives, selected in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, from
mutually agreeing to the establishment of system,
group, or regional boards of adjustment for the purpose of adjusting and deciding disputes of the character specified in this section. In the event that
either party to such a system, group, or regional
board of adjustment is dissatisfied with such arrangement, it may upon ninety days' notice to the other
party elect to come under the jurisdiction of the
Adjustment Board." 45 U. S. C. § 153 Second.
This machinery was designed to serve the stated purposes of the Act-which were, among others: "To avoid
any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any
carrier engaged therein" and "to provide for the prompt
and orderly settlement of all disputes growing out of
grievances or out of the interpretation or application of
agreements covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions." § 2, 45 U. S. C. § 151a. Implementing such goals,
§ 2 First, 45 U. S. C. § 152 First, made it "the duty of all
carriers, their officers, agents, and employees to exert
every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements . . . and to settle all disputes, whether arising out
of the application of such agreements or otherwise, in order
to avoid any interruption to commerce." The statute
directed that minor disputes be handled on the property
in the usual manner, but failing adjustment either party
could take the matter to the adjustment board, which was
to hear and decide it. This provision is applicable both
to rail (§ 3 Second) and air (§ 204) carriers.
II.
In view of the clearly stated purposes of the Act and of
its history, reflecting as it does a steady congressional

372 U. S.

intent to move toward a reliable and effective system for
the settlement of grievances, we believe Congress intended
no hiatus in the statutory scheme when it postponed the
establishment of a National Air Transport Adjustment
Board and instead provided for compulsory system, group,
or regional boards. Although the system boards were
expected to be temporary arrangements, we cannot believe
that Congress intended an interim period of confusion and
chaos or meant to leave the establishment of the Boards
to the whim of the parties. Instead, it intended the statutory command to be legally enforceable in the courts and
the boards to be organized and operated consistent with
the purposes of the Act.
We have held other duties imposed upon the carriers
and their employees by the Railway Labor Act binding
and their breach redressable in the federal courts, such
as the duty to bargain, Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation,300 U. S. 515, 545, and the duty of a certified barkaining representative to represent all members of the
craft without discrimination, Steele v. Louisville & N. R.
Co., 323 U. S. 192.1' We take a similar view of the duty
to establish adjustment boards under § 204; and as the
Court said in Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive
Enginemen, 323 U. S. 210, 213, quoting from Deitrick v.
Greaney, 309 U. S. 190, 200-201, "the extent and nature
of the legal consequences" of this duty "though left by
the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless to

Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Enginemen, 323 U. S. 210,
213; Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U. S. 184, 189-190. These cases, and the
one at bar, are unlike such cases as Switchmen's Union v. National
Mediation Board, 320 U. S.297, and General Committee v.. M.-K.-T.
R. Co., 320 U. S. 323, where Congress intended no judicial review and
its denial impaired no federal rights.

be derived from it and the federal policy which it has
adopted.""
It is therefore the statute and the federal law which
must determine whether the contractual arrangements
made by the parties are sufficient to discharge the mandate of § 204 and are consistent with the Act and its purposes. It is federal law which would determine whether
a § 204 contract is valid and enforceable according to its
terms. If these contracts are to serve this function under
§ 204, their validity, interpretation, and enforceability
cannot be left to the laws of the many States, for it would
be fatal to the goals of the Act if a contractual provision
contrary to the federal command were nevertheless enforced under state law or if a contract were struck dpwn

even though in furtherance of the federal scheme."5

15 As the dissenting judge below remarked, 295 F. 2d, at 221-222:
.. Congress in 1936 could not . . . have thought that stability
and continuity to interstate air commerce would come from the undulating policies . . . of the legislatures and courts (or both) of 48
states in the enforcement of anything thought so essential to industrial
peace as this system of governmentally compelled arbitration." The
dissenting opinion also points out the difficult conflict of laws problems which applying state law would raise, 295 F. 2d, at 223:
"Not the least of the absurdities is that an airplane flies from state
to state. What state is to be the forum? What state was the
parent of this creature-the consensual contract containing the agreement to arbitrate? May any or all of the states beneath the route
or routes traveled by the airline be resorted to? Is the continuity
of essential air traffic to be at the plaintiff 's choice of forum? What
is to happen when several plaintiffs bring several suits in several

needs of the subject matter manifestly call for uniformity.1" Compare Teamsters Union v. Lucas Flour Co.,
369 U. S. 95, 103-104.
The contracts and the adjustment boards for which
they provide are creations of federal law and bound to
the statute and its policy. If any provision contained in
a § 204 contract is enforceable, it is because of congressional sanction: "[T]he federal statute is the source of
the power and authority ....
The enactment of the federal statute ...

is the governmental action ...

though it

takes a private agreement to invoke the federal sanction. . . . A union agreement made pursuant to the
Railway Labor Act has, therefore, the imprimatur of the
federal law upon it . . . ." ' Railway Dept. v. Hanson,351
U. S. 225, 232. That is, the § 204 contract, like the
Labor Management Relations Act § 301 contract, is a
federal contract and is therefore governed and enforceable
by federal law, in the federal courts. The situation presented here is analogous to that in American Surety Co.
v. Shulz, 237 U. S. 159, a suit on a supersedeas bond in an
appeal from a District Court to the Court of Appeals.
When the judgment against the appellant was affirmed
and he failed to pay it, the appellee sued the surety in the
District Court. This Court held that there was "arising
under" jurisdiction, since the bond had been given pursuant to the federal statute requiring one when appeals
states? Is effective federal control of an operational activity deemed
so essential to national welfare to be precariously dependent upon
the accident of diversity of citizenship ?"
26 To be sure, different airlines may use different contracts, and
any one may have different agreements for different crafts, but such
lack of uniformity represents a minimal burden on comr-rce. The
lack of uniformity created by dividing everything by 50 (or however
many States the system spans) would multiply the burden by a
substantial factor and aggravate the problem to an intolerable degree.

were taken; the construction of the bond and the extent
of the surety company's liability under it were said to be
federal questions which the federal courts had jurisdiction
to determine."'
17 The Shulz case followed a line of authority involving suits on
bonds given by federal officers to ensure their faithful performance
of their federal duties, in which the Court had held that there was
federal jurisdiction for suits by an aggrieved party seeking to collect
from the surety. Bock v. Perkins, 139 U. S. 628 (suit for tort of U. S.
marshal committed in performance of duty); Sonnentheil v. Moerlein
Co., 172 U. S.401 (same); see Feibelman v. Packard, 109 U. S. 421
(same, removal case); Howard v. United States, 184 U. S. 676 (suit
against surety of clerk-of court brought ex rel. United States to
recover for clerk's appropriation of money paid into federal court).
The same rule that federal law applies to federal contracts has been
applied, in a choice of substantive law rather than jurisdictional context, in cases involving rights and obligations arising on commercial
paper issued by the United States. See, e. g., Metropolitan Bank v.
United States, 323 U. S.454; Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States,
318 U. S.363, 366. See also Royal Indem. Co. v. United States, 313
U. S. 289, 296 (general law rather than local law governs whether
Government may collect interest on surety bond given to secure
collection of taxes); American Pipe & Steel Corp. v. Firestone Co.,
292 F. 2d 640, 643-644 (C. A. 9th Cir.) (construction of subcontract
governed by federal law in suit between prime and sub on government
contract); Girard-Trust Co. v. United States, 149 F. 2d 872 (C. A.
3d Cir.) (federal law governs rights of parties in lease where Government is lessee, Tucker Act suit); Woodward v. United States, 167
F. 2d 774 (C. A. 8th Cir.) (federal law governs interpretation of
National Service Life Insurance policy, suit against Government on
policy). Although these decisions did not involve federal jurisdiction as such, since jurisdiction was conferred by specific statutes and
recourse to the "arising under" statute was unnecessary, they are
suggestive since they hold- federal law determinative of the merits of
the claim. Also highly suggestive, for the same reason, is this Court's
language in Sola Elec. Co. v. Jefferson Elec. Co., 317 U. S. 173, 176,
a case involving both federal patent-antitrust policies and conflicting
state contract law policies of estoppel:

More specifically, the provisions of a § 204 contract,
such as those governing the composition of the adjustment board, the procedures to be employed as to notice
and hearing or for-breaking deadlocks, or the finality to be
accorded board awards, are to be judged against the Act
and its purposes and enforced or invalidated in a fashion
consistent with the statutory scheme.18 There may be,
for example, any number of provisions with regard to the
finality of an award that would satisfy the requirements of
§ 204 but we are quite sure that some such provision is requisite to a § 204 contract and that the federal law would
look with favor upon contractual provisions affording
some degree of finality to system board awards. Congress has long since abandoned the approach of the completely unenforceable award which was used in the 1920
Act. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, supra. Adjustment
board decisions were expressly made final and binding in
nated by the sweep of federal statutes that legal relations which they
affect must be deemed governed by federal law having its source
in those statutes, rather than by local law."
18Thus in cases involving adjustment board procedures or awards,
the federal courts have applied federal substantive law to the determination of the validity of the award and the procedures for securing
it, irrespective of whether the case was brought into the f-deral
court system on the basis of diversity. See International Assn. of
Machinists v. Northwest Airlines, 304 F. 2d 206 (C. A. 8th Cir.);

Opinion of the Court.

the 1926 Act, the National Railroad Adjustment Board
awards were made enforceable iithe federal courts by the
1934 amendments, and the awards under voluntary arbitration agreements were likewise made expressly enforceable by the statute. There is no reason to believe that in
1936 Congress discarded for an entire industry an element
essential to a reliable system of settling disputes under
existing contracts or that it contemplated awards by adjustment boards the enforceability of which depended
.entirely upon the desires of the parties or upon state
statutes or court decisions. Quite the contrary, the Act,
its history, and its purposes lead us to conclude that when
Congress ordered the establishment of system boards to
hear and decide airline contract disputes, it "intended the
Board to be and to act as a public agency, not as a private go-between; its awards to have legal effect, not
merely that of private advice." Bower v. EasternAirlines,

III.
The contract of the parties here was executed under
§ 204 and declares a system board award to be final, binding, and conclusive. The claim stated in the complaint
is based upon the award and .demands that it be enforced.
Whether Central must comply with the award or whether,
instead, it is impeachable, are questions controlled by
federal law and are to be answered with due regard for
the statutory scheme and purpose. To the extent that
the contract imposes a duty consistent with the Act to
comply with the awards, that duty is a federal requirement. If Central must comply, it is because federal law
requires its compliance.
In the circumstances we have here, we are not dealing
with a suit involving an aspect of federal law which is
only collateral or remote or a case where state and federal

See Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S.
180; Gully v. First Nat. Bank, 299 U. S. 109; Skelly Oil
Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667; Romero v.
InternationalTerm. Co., 358 U. S. 354, 393, n. 4 (dissenting and concurring opinion). In our view the complaint
in this case, for jurisdictional purposes, presented a substantial claim having its source in and arising under the
Railway Labor Act and the District Court therefore has
jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 if the jurisdictional
amount is satisfied and in any case under § 1337. Romero
v. International Term. Co., 358 U. S. 354; MontanaDakota Co. v. Northwestern P. S. Co., 341 U. S. 246, 249;
American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241
U. S. 257, 260.9
Reversed and remanded.
