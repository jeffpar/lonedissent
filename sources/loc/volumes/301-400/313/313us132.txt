it cannot be said as a matter of law that an executor
comes into this category merely because he conserves
the estate by marshalling and gathering the assets as a
mere conduit for ultimate distribution. And determination of what constitutes "carrying on . . . business"
under the Revenue Act does not depend upon the size
of the estate or the number of people whose services are
required in order properly to conserve it.
The judgment of the Court or Claims is vacated and
the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings in
accordance with the views herein expressed.

ARKANSAS CORPORATION COMMISSION ET AL. V.
THOMPSON, TRUSTEE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 715.

Argued April 4, 1941.-Decided April 28, 1941.

1. Assumed, without deciding, that § 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act
is applicable in railroad reorganization proceedings under § 77.
P. 138.
2. Section 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act giving priority to
"taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to . . . any State,"
and providing "That, in case any question arises as to the amount
or legality of any taxes, such question shall be heard and determined
by the [bankruptcy] court," does not empower that court to revise the valuation of a railroad which has been finally fixed, pursuant to the state law, as the basis for a state tax. P. 142.
So held where the valuation was by a state commission having
broad authority in the regulation of railroads and other public
utilities and over valuations for tax purposes, in quasi-judicial
proceedings in which the reorganization trustee had been fully heard
and from the result of which he took no appeal to the state
courts, as permitted by state law. New Jersey v. Anderson, 203
U. S. 483, distinguished.
116 F. 2d 179, reversed.

Argument for Petitioners.
CERTIORARI,

312 U. S. 673, to review the affirmance of an

order in a railroad reorganization proceeding which overruled a motion by the present petitioners for the dismissal of a petition filed by Thompson, Trustee. His petition alleged that certain state taxes laid on the railroad
were excessive and unlawful and sought to have their
validity determined by the bankruptcy court.

Argument for Respondent.

The provision of § 64 of the Bankruptcy Act "that in
case any question arises as to the amount or legality of
any taxes, such question shall be heard and determined
by the Court" is not inconsistent with § 77, and is of governing force in proceedings under § 77. Michigan v.
Michigan Trust Co., 296 U. S. 334; In re Denver & Rio
Grande Western R. Co., 23 F. Supp. 298; St. Francis
Levee Dist. v. Kurn, 91 F. 2d 118; St. Francis Levee
District v. Kurn, 98 F. 2d 394.
The jurisdiction to hear and determine any question
as to taxes, under the provisions of § 64 (a) of the Act,
extends to taxes accruing during the Trustee's possession
of the property. Henderson County v. Wilkins, 43 F.
2d 670; Dickinson v. Riley, 96 F. 2d 385; In re Denver
& Rio Grande Western R. Co., 23 F. Supp. 298; St.
Francis Levee Dist. v. Kurn, 91 F. 2d 118; St. Francis
Levee Dist. v. Kurn, 98 F. 2d 394.
The order of April 11, 1940, was not an injunction and
was not in violation of Jud. Code § 24. Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610; Henderson County v. Wilkins, 43 F.
2d 670; St. Francis Levee Dist. v. Kurn, 91 F. 2d 118;
St. FrancisLevee Dist. v. Kurn, 98 F. 2d 394.
Even though the Arkansas statutes may provide for a
judicial review in the state's courts of the assessments
made by the Corporation Commission, this does not deprive the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to hear and
determine the amount or legality of any tax involved.

Messrs. Jack Holt, Attorney General of Arkansas,
Charles T. Coleman and Walter G. Riddick filed a brief
on behalf of the State of Arkansas.
The validity and amount of tax claims must be determined in accordance with the laws of the taxing sovereignty.
The Arkansas Corporation Commission is a quasijudicial tribunal. Its decisions can not be overturned
by the courts for mere mistakes of fact or errors of
judgment.
The trustee did not exhaust the administrative remedy
provided by the Arkansas statute. The principle that the
administrative remedy for relief against an alleged illegal
tax must be exhausted before resort may be had to the
courts for that purpose, is applicable to trustees in bankruptcy. In re Gustav Schaefer Co., 103 F. 2d 237; City
of Springfield v. Hotel Charles, 84 F. 2d 589; In re Perlmutter, 256 F. 861; In re 168 Adams Building Corp., 105
F. 2d 704; In re A. V. Manning's Sons, 16 F. Supp. 632;
In re Schach, 17 F. Supp. 437.
The bankruptcy court has no power, under § 77, to reassess the taxes due by the Trustee. Section 77 authorizes the formulation of a railroad reorganization plan,
subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of the court,othat will be fair and just to the
creditors and stockholders, and which will guarantee the
continued operation of the railroad. The word "taxes"
does not appear in § 77, and there is nothing in the section indicating an intention to confer on bankruptcy
courts the extraordinary power to assess or re-assess taxes.

Opinion of the Court.

If a tax is valid when measured by the laws of the
taxing sovereign the bankruptcy court should allow it.
If a tax is invalid when measured by those laws, it is the
duty of the bankruptcy court to disallow it. The allowance or disallowance of a tax claim exhausts the entire
judicial power of the court.
The assessment of taxes is referable to the legislative
power, and it is no part of the judicial function. Central
Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, 290
U. S. 264. See also: West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 294 U. S. 63; Rowley v. Chicago & N. W.
Ry. Co., 293 U. S. 102; GreatNorthern Ry. Co. v. Weeks,

U. S. 362; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 295
U. S. 662; CentralR. Co. v. Martin,115 F. 2d 968.
This principle has been held to be applicable to tax
claims filed in bankruptcy proceedings. City of Detroit
v. Detroit & Canada Tunnel Co., 92 F. 2d 833; Cross v.
GeorgiaIron & Coal Co., 250 F. 438; In re Gould Manufacturing Co., 11 F. Supp. 644; In re Schach, 17 F. Supp.
437; In re 168 Adams Building Corp., 27 F. Supp. 247.
The trustee's petition is a collateral attack on the
assessment made by the Commission. The assessment is
prima facie valid and it must be judged on the record
before the Commission. The judicial function is exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the
conclusions approved by the administrative body.
Messrs. David T. Wilentz, Attorney General of New
Jersey, and Duane E. Minard filed a brief on behalf of
the State of New Jersey, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.

determine for state tax purposes the property value of
a railroad (Missouri Pacific) in reorganization under
9 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, the state (Arkansas) having
already determined such value through its own taxing
officials and in accordance with the procedure prescribed
by valid state legislation.
Over the objections of Arkansas officials, the District
Court sitting in bankruptcy held that it did have such
power. 33 F. Supp. 728. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed. 116 F. 2d 179. In so holding, both oourts relied on § 64 (a) of the general bankruptcy act, 11 U. S. C.
§ 104 (a) (Supp. 1939), as the source of this power. That
section, so far as pertinent here, provides "The debts to
have priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to
creditors, and to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates
. . . shall be . . . (4) taxes legally due and owing by
the bankrupt to the United States or any State . . . :
Provided, . . . That, in case any question arises as to the
amount or legality of any taxes, such question shall
be heard and determined by the [bankruptcy]
court . . ."
Petitioners contend that § 64 (a) is in its entirety
inconsistent I with the aims and purposes of § 77, 11 U. S. C.
§ 205 (Supp. 1939), and that it therefore has no application here. That question we need not decide. For
we are of opinion that the Congressional language giving

'Section 77 (1) provides: "In proceedings under this section and
consistent with the provisions thereof, the jurisdiction and powers
of the court ....
and the rights and liabilities of creditors, ...

shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had
been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the
day when the debtor's petition was filed." (Italics supplied.)
Among the federal court decisions cited in briefs supporting the
petition as bearing on the issue of inconsistency between § § 64 (a)
and 77, either directly or indirectly, are the following: Lowden v.

to the bankruptcy court power to determine the "amount
or legality" of taxes does not mean that the court is
given power to redetermine and revise the property value
finally fixed by a state under the circumstances revealed
by the trustee's petition, even though that value is the
basis used in computing the amount of taxes "legally
due and owing."
An explanation of the power, functions, and action of
the Arkansas Corporation Commission is essential to a
clear understanding of this case. That Commission is a
state agency created pursuant to state constitutional requirements.2 It is vested with broad authority in the
regulation of railroads, canals, turnpikes, public utilities,
motor vehicles, sleeping cars, telephone and telegraph
companies, and companies transmitting and distributing
gas, oil and electricity.8 Also, in the administration of
the state tax laws the Corporation Commission has general and complete supervision and control over the valuation, assessment and equalization of all property. Before entering upon his duties in the assessment of property, each member of the Commission must subscribe to
an oath that he will well and truly value and assess all
property required to be assessed.' The Commission has
full power to summon witnesses and hear evidence, but
further, before assessments are finally determined, all
persons interested have the right, on written application,
to appear and be heard.

The Missouri Pacific has been in reorganization under

§ 77, with respondent as trustee, since 1933. In 1939, as
in the preceding years, the railroad's properties were being operated by the trustee. The Commission, after a
hearing in which the trustee participated, fixed the value
of the railroad's Arkansas property, and levied an assessment for 1939. The trustee's motion for rehearing was
heard, considered, and overruled by the Commission.
The trustee concedes here that the hearing granted by the
Commission was in "full compliance with all the administrative steps required by the Arkansas statute." Under
controlling Arkansas law, it is provided that "Within
thirty days after the entry on the record of the said Arkansas Corporation Commission of any order made by it,
any party aggrieved may file a written motion with any
member of such commission or with the secretary thereof
praying for appeal from such order to the circuit court
of Pulaski County; and thereupon said appeal shall be
automatically deemed as granted as a matter of right
without any further order." ' Any party aggrieved by
the Circuit Court's decision may then obtain as a matter of
right an appeal to the Supreme Court of the state.' It is
provided by statute that preferential standing on the
docket be given to appeals from the Commission to the
Circuit Court, and from the Circuit Court to the Supreme
Court.
The Commission's final order fixing the value of the
railroad's property for tax assessment was entered on December 4, 1939. The trustee did not appeal to the Circuit
Court of Pulaski County within thirty days as authorized
by Arkansas law, and the assessment of the Corporation
Commission thereupon became final. Thus tested by
Arkansas taxation legislation, the assessed taxes were, in
Id., § 2019.

Opinion of the Court.

the language of § 64 (a), "legally due and owing" to the
state in the "amount" fixed by the Commission, and were
not subject to further judicial review, unless the special
circumstance that a taxpayer is in bankruptcy or reorganization places it in a separate tax classification different from that of all other Arkansas taxpayers.
But three months after the expiration of the time allowed by the state for the trustee to appeal from the Commission's order-specifically, on April 11, 1940-the trustee petitioned the bankruptcy court, sitting in Missouri,
to determine the "amount or legality" of the Arkansas
tax by revising the property value found by the Corporation Commission and upon which the amount was based.
The basis of the trustee's petition was that the Commission had made an overassessment, in that after a hearing
it had determined the property to be worth far more than
its actual value. This argument rested upon a contention
that the Commission had overvalued the property by giving "predominant weight . . . to original cost and to cost
of reproduction, and wholly inadequate consideration
. . . to the market value of the railroad's stocks and bonds
and to an enormous reduction in earnings occasioned by
general business considerations and to rapid increase of
competition from buses, trucks, water and air." The
bankruptcy court was asked to find the Commission's tax
assessment illegal upon three grounds: (1) The value determined by the Board was greatly in excess of the fair
market value of the railroad's property and therefore there
was a violation of that section of Arkansas law which provides that the assessment shall be "upon the consideration
of what a clear fee simple title thereto would sell for
under conditions under which that character of property is
usually sold."'
(2) The assessment was in violation of
§ 5 of Article 16 of the Constitution of Arkansas which
+Id., § 2044.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

provides that all property shall be taxed according to its
value and that no one species of property from which a tax
may be collected shall be taxed higher than another species
of property of equal value, and that all values shall be
ascertained so as to make the same equal and uniform
throughout the state. (3) The alleged excessive valuation
fixed by the Commission was in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
It is thus obvious that the trustee's petition, which the
bankruptcy court refused to dismiss, rested entirely upon
the assumption that § 64 (a) (4) gave the bankruptcy
court power to hold a completely new hearing in order to
set its own value on the property, regardless of the value
fixed by the state through its expert and specially
constituted quasi-judicial agency."
But we do not so interpret § 64 (a) (4). What § 64
(a) (4) relates to is "taxes legally due and owing by
the bankrupt." And what that section further provides
is that "in case any question arises as to the amount or
legality of any taxes, such question shall be heard and
determined by the court; . . ." Nothing in this language indicates that taxpayers in bankruptcy or reorganization are intended to have the extraordinary
privilege of two separate trials, one state and one federal, on an identical issue of controverted fact--the value
of the property taxed. Manifestly, whether or not taxes
are "legally due and owing" to a state depends upon the
valid laws of that state. Ad valorem taxes depend upon
a determination of value. The governmental function
of fixing the value for tax purposes has rarely, if ever,
'Among the lower federal court decisions discussing the power
of bankruptcy courts under § 64 (a) (4) are: In re Gould Mfg. Co.,
11 F. Supp. 644; In re 168 Adams Building Corp., 27 F. Supp.
247, affirmed, 105 F. 2d 704; In re Sehach, 17 F. Supp. 437, 439;

been a judicial function. The "legality" of the action
of Arkansas in entrusting the determination of value to
its Corporation Commission is not challenged here, as
of course it could not be. If the Commission properly
found the value of the property, the "amount" of the
taxes is not in question. For it is not asserted that the
Commission made an improper arithmetical computation in applying the legal tax rate to the determined
property value. It is in this respect, as well as with
regard to the dissimilar duties and functions of the state
administrative agencies involved, that this case differs
from that of New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483,
upon whiph the trustee here strongly relies. In that
case, as here, the relevant provision of § 64 (a) was relied
on as authorizing the bankruptcy court to determine the
"amount or legality" of taxes. New Jersey had imposed
a franchise tax upon the outstanding-not the authorized-capital stock of corporations, varying in proportion to the number of shares. A state agency, without
a hearing, imposed a tax on the $40,000,000 authorized
stock of the company involved, when in fact the company had only $10,000,000 of such stock outstanding.
This Court said: "It may well be doubted whether the
board had power to tax any other stock [except that
outstanding]. But be that as it may, section 64a specifically provides that in case any question arises as to
the amount or legality of taxes, the same shall be heard
and determined by the court, with a view to ascertaining the amount really due. We do not think it was the
intention of Congress to conclude the bankruptcy courts
by the findings of boards of this character, and that the
claim should have been upon the basis of the capital
stock actually outstanding." But in that case the trustee
argued in his brief before this Court that under controlling New Jersey law "the assessors acted ministerially, not judicially," their "determination was merely

computation," and their actions exceeded their statutory
authority.'
The Arkansas Corporation Commission, however, does
not act ministerially. On the contrary, it is a quasijudicial agency entrusted with wide responsibilities in
connection with the general tax system of the state.
Upon it the state relies for the hearing and determination of matters essential to the maintenance and fair
functioning of a uniform tax system. For reasons deemed
suitable to it, the state has elected to confide this duty
to the same agency which has power to exercise statewide regulatory supervision over public utilities, including railroads. The difficulties in fixing railroad valuations are well known, and have been many times
adverted to by this Court. ° The Corporation Commission has been chosen by Arkansas as the ultimate guardian of the rights of the state and its taxpayers, subject
only to that judicial review provided for by the state.
"The State has confided those rights to its protection and
has trusted to its honor and capacity as it confides the
protection of other social relations to the courts of law."
Chicago,B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Babcock, 204 U. S. 585, 598.
If the trustee had availed himself of his right of appeal
to the courts of Arkansas, with an ultimate right of
appeal to this Court for final determination of federal
questions, it is difficult to believe that it would now
be seriously argued that Congress, by § 64 (a) (4), in' In advancing this argument counsel called attention to the case
of People's Investment Co. v. State Board of Assessors, 66 N. J. L.
175; 48 A. 579, in which the Court had said that it was beyond
the jurisdiction of the tax agent to levy a tax on any but the outstanding capital stock.

tended to impose upon the bankruptcy court the unusual
power and delicate duty of trying out afresh the facts
found by the state with relation to the value of property. And there is no more reason to assume that Congress intended that the bankruptcy court should fail to
give respect to an unappealed determination of value
made by the Arkansas Corporation Commission. Bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings today cover a wide
area in the business field. But there is nothing in the history of bankruptcy or reorganization legislation to support the theory that Congress intended to set the federal
courts up as super-assessment tribunals over state taxing agencies. The express legislative purpose of Arkansas to move towards a more nearly uniform and fairly
distributed tax burden through relying on supervision
by a single agency could be in large part frustrated by
the construction of the Bankruptcy Act for which the
trustee here contends. Section 64 (a), thus construed,
would tend to obstruct, and not to facilitate, the enforcement of state tax laws.'1 Nothing in the language of
the Act requires such a construction. And the policy of
revising and redetermining state tax valuations contended for by the trustee would be a complete reversal
of our historic national policy of federal non-interference with the taxing power of states.
For the reasons given, it is our opinion that the District
Court should have dismissed the trustee's petition.
