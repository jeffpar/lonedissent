ROYAL INDEMNITY CO. v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 817.

Argued May 7, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.

1. Collectors of Internal Revenue are subordinate officers charged
with the ministerial duty of collecting taxes; and in the absence of
any statute granting the authority, they can not release a bond to
the Goverment of the United States securing payment of a tax. Only
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to compromise a tax deficiency
for a sum less than the amount lawfully due. P. 294.
2. The rule against allowing interest as damages for delay in paying
interest alone, is inapplicable to an action to enforce a surety's
agreement to pay a tax with interest found due to the Government
under the revenue laws. P. 295.
3. A suit upon a contractual obligation to pay money at a fixed or
ascertainable time is a suit to recover damage for its breach, including both the principal amount and interest by way of damage for
delay in payment of the principal, after the due date. And, in the
absence of any controlling statutory regulation, the trial court is
as competent to determine the amount of interest for delay as
any other item of damage. P. 295.
4. In the absence of an applicable federal statute, it is for the federal courts to determine, according to their own criteria, the appropriate measure of damage, expressed in terms of interest, for
delayed payment of a contractual obligation of the United States.
P. 296.
5. In an action at law by the United States to recover an amount
due and owing from a taxpayer's surety, equitable rules governing interest recoverable in suits for an accounting or for recovery on quasi-contractual obligations are inapplicable, and
interest upon the principal sum from the date of default, at a
fair rate, is an appropriate measure of damage for the delay in payment. P. 296.
6. In the circumstances of this case, a suitable rate of interest is that
prevailing in New York, the State where the obligation was contracted and to be performed. P. 297.
116 F. 2d 247, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, post, p. 552, to review a judgment affirming with modification a recovery by the United States in
an action against the surety on a taxpayer's bond.

Mr. Harry S. Hall, with whom Mr. Nathaniel E.
Wheeler was on the brief, for petitioner.
The Collector of Internal Revenue was vested with implied power to cancel the surety bond and to discharge
from liability thereon. 26 U. S. C. § 1541 (a); R. S.
3183; 26 U. S. C. § 1549 (b). See UnitedStates v. Wolper,
86 F. 2d 715; UnitedStates v. Royal Indemnity Co., 116 F.
2d 247, 248; UnitedStates v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 80 F.
2d 24, cert. den. 298 U. S. 665.
This implied power derives from his express powers in
the collection of taxes. Heinemann Chemical Co. v.
United States, 92 F. 2d 302, 303, 304; Brewerton v.
United States, 9 F. Supp. 503, 507. Cf., United States
v. Alexander, 110 U. S. 325, 328. The Government's
acquiescence in the practice points persuasively to the
existence of such implied power.
In the collection of taxes, the Collector is not a subordinate official of the Government. 26 U. S. C. § 1541
(a). He has no superior vested with power or authority
to direct and control him in the performance of his
duties. State ex rel. Landis v. Blake, 110 Fla. 178, 181;
People ex rel. Jacobus v. Van Wyck, 157 N. Y. 495, 506;
Kane v. Erie R. Co., 142 F. 682, 685; In re Weaver, 131
N. Y. S. 144, 145.
The Collector is vested with power to colleet taxes
without direction as to how it is to be exercised. He
therefore has discretion in the exercise of the power.

The interest claimed by respondent is that provided
by New York General Business Law, Consol. Laws, c. 20,
§ 370, as damages for breach of contract. This interest
is not provided for in the bond; and is therefore not a
part of the contract and cannot be recovered as such.
If recoverable at all, it is by way of damages for the detention of money after it is due.
Interest is the compensation allowed by law, or fixed
by the parties, for the use or forbearance of money, or as
damages for its detention. Loudon v. Shelby County
Taxing District, 104 U. S. 771, 774; New Orleans Ins.
Assn. v. Piaggio, 16 Wall. 378, 386; Hiatt v. Brown, 15
Wall. 177, 185, 186.
The law allows interest only on the ground of a contract, express or implied, for its payment, or as damages
for the detention of money, or for the breach of some
contract, or the violation of some duty. Morley v.

Where such interest is claimed, laches is a bar to recovery. United States v. Sanborn, 135 U. S. 271, 281,

Mr. Edward J. Ennis, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and
Messrs. Sewall Key and Lee A. Jackson were on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
A collector of internal revenue, who had accepted a
surety bond filed with him by a taxpayer to, accompany
his claim for abatement of income tax, consented to termination of all liability upon the bond and surrendered
it before its obligation was fully satisfied. The questions
for decision are whether the collector had power to release the obligation of the bond and, if not, whether the
United States is entitled to interest on the amount of its
claim against the surety.
Upon the Commissioner's assessment in 1920 of additional income taxes in the sum of $29,128, asserted to
be due from the taxpayer for 1917, the taxpayer filed a
claim for abatement of the assessment, and to secure suspension of collection of the tax, executed a bond to the

ROYAL INDEMNITY CO. v. U. S.
289

Opinion of the Court.

collector in the sum of $38,000 with petitioner as surety,
conditioned upon payment on May 2, 1923, of the tax
with interest. The Commissioner allowed the claim in
abatement in part but rejected it to the extent of
$8,223.38, on which interest had then accrued in the sum
of $4,169.07. On demand of the Commissioner on August 5, 1926, for the principal amount of the tax with
interest to the date of demand, petitioner paid only the
principal amount of the tax to the collector by draft of
December 17, 1926, bearing the notation on its face that
it was in full payment of the tax and of all liability on
the bond. The collector collected the draft and surrendered the bond to petitioner with the statement that
all liability on it had terminated.
In the present suit on the bond the District Court held
that the collector was without authority to release the
bond and gave judgment for the sum of $4,169.07, found
by the Commissioner to be the interest on the unpaid tax
to the date of the rejection of the claim for its abatement, but refused to allow interest accruing subsequent
to that date. On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that, under § 370 of the New York General Business Law, interest at six per cent. should be added to the
unpaid balance found to be due on the bond, and modified the judgment accordingly. 116 F. 2d 247. We
granted certiorari April 7, 1941, because of the importance
of the questions presented, and of a conflict of the decision below with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit in Heinemann Chemical Co. v. United
States, 92 F. 2d 302.
It is not denied that the collector had authority to
accept the bond, that it created a new cause of action
distinct from that on the taxpayer's obligation, and that,
if it has not been released, the United States has authority to sue upon it, see United States v. John Barth Co.,
279 U. S. 370; Gulf States Steel Co. v. United States, 287

U. S. 32; United States v. Wolper, 86 F. 2d 715; United
States v. Oswego Falls Corp., 113 F. 2d 322. And it is
conceded that, as the bond was conditioned on the payment of the taxes with interest, petitioner is indebted to
the Government upon it for the amount of the interest
which had accrued at the time of the rejection of the
claim in abatement. See Botany Worsted Mills v.
United States, 278 U. S. 282; Hughson v. United States,
59 F. 2d 17, 19; United States v. Steinberg, 100 F. 2d
124, 126. Respondent's contentions are that the balance
of interest then due was released by the collector and
that in any case it was not bound to pay interest on that
balance.
- Power to release or otherwise dispose of the rights and
property of the United States is lodged in the Congress
by the Constitution. / Art. IV, § 3, Cl. 2. Subordinate
officers of the United States are without that power, save
only as it has been conferred upon them by Act of Congress or is to be implied from other powers so granted.

v. United States, 95 U. S. 316, 318; Hawkins v. United
States, 96 U. S. 689, 691; Utah Power & Light Co. v.
United States, 243 U. S. 389, 409; Wilber National Bank
v. UnitedStates, 294 U. S. 120, 123-124; cf. United States
v. Shaw, 309 U. S. 495, 501; Ritter v. United States, 28 F.
2d 265; United States v. Globe Indemnity Co., 94 F. 2d
576. Collectors of internal revenue are subordinate officers charged with the ministerial duty of collecting the
taxes. R. S. § 3183, Erskine v. Hohnbach, 14 Wall. 613,
616; Harding v. Woodcock, 137 U. S. 43, 46; Moore Ice
Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 380, 381. There is no
statute in terms authorizing them to remit taxes, to pass
upon the claims for abatement of taxes, or to release any
obligation for their payment. Only the Commissioner,
with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to compromise a tax deficiency for a sum less than

ROYAL INDEMNITY CO. v. U. S.
289

Opinion of the Court.

the amount lawfully due. R. S. § § 3220, 3229, 26 U. S. C.
1661; 45 T, R., Art. 1011 (1918 Act); Botany Worsted
Mills v. United States, supra, 288; Loewy & Son v. Commissioner, 31 F. 2d 652, 654.
There is thus no basis in the statutes of the United
States for implying an authority in a collector to release
a bond for the payment of the tax which the Commissioner alone is permitted to reduce by way of compromise
when the Secretary of the Treasury consents. Heinemann Chemical Co. v. United States, supra, and Brewerton v. United States, 9 F. Supp. 503, to the contrary,
plainly rest upon a misapplication of the ruling in United
States v. Alexander, 110 U. S. 325, which sustained the
release of a bond for taxes by the Secretary of the Treasury which had been specifically authorized by an Act of
Congress.
The District Court rejected the Government's claim
for interest upon the balance found due upon the bond
as a demand for interest on interest, which has generally
been held not to be an appropriate measure of damages
for the delayed payment of interest alone. See Cherokee
Nation v. United States, 270 U. S. 476, 490. In any case,
it thought that the allowance of interest would be inequitable because of the collector's return of the bond to petitioner and the Government's delay in bringing the suit.
But, as the Court of Appeals held, the obligation of petitioner to pay the interest accrued on the principal amount
of'tax under the applicable provisions of the Revenue Act
was not damage assessed against petitioner for its nonpayment of interest. Petitioner's obligation was contractual to pay an amount found to be due from the taxpayer, and the suit against it is for a debt ex contractu,
due and owing in conformity to the terms of the bond.
See United States v. John Barth Co., supra; Gulf States
Steel Co. v. United States, supra.

a fixed or ascertainable time is a suit to recover damage

for its breach, including both the principal amount and
interest by way of damage for delay in payment of the
principal, after the due date. And in the absence of any
controlling statutory regulation the trial court is as competent to determine the amount of interest for delay as
any other item of damage. UnitedStates v. United States
Fidelity Co., 236 U. S. 512, 528; Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall.
562, 565; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 76 F.
2d 626; United States v. Wagner, 93 F. 2d 77; United
States v. Hamilton, 96 F. 2d 878; Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. v. United States, 97 F. 2d 879, 881.
But the rule governing the interest to be recovered as
damages for delayed payment of a contractual obligation
to the United States is not controlled by state statute or
local common law. In the absence of an applicable federal statute, it is for the federal courts to determine, according to their own criteria, the appropriate measure of
damage, expressed in terms of interest, for non-payment
of the amount found to be due. Board of County Commissionersv. UnitedStates, 308 U. S. 343, 350, 352; Young
v. Godbe, supra, 565; cf. Billings v. United States, 232
U. S. 261, 284, et seq.
The present suit is at law for the recovery of an amount
due and owing, which petitioner has contracted to pay.
To such a case, equitable rules relating to interest recoverable in suits for an accounting, or for recovery on
quasi-contractual obligations arising from payment of
money by mistake, are inapplicable. United States v.
United States Fidelity Co., supra, 528; cf. Redfield v.
Ystalyfera Iron Co., 110 U. S. 174, 176; United States v.
Sanborn, 135 U. S. 271, 281; Redfield v. Bartels, 139 U. S.
694, 702. Here, responsibility for delay in payment rests
quite as much upon the debtor, who is chargeable with
knowledge of its own obligation and the breach of it, as
upon the creditor. And in the meantime the debtor has
had the use of the money, of which its default has de-

prived the creditor. Interest upon the principal sum from
the date of default, at a fair rate, is therefore an appropriate measure of damage for the delay in payment.
United States v. United States Fidelity Co., supra, 528;
MassachusettsBonding & Ins. Co. v. United States, supra.
United States v. Wagner, supra;Maryland Casualty Co.
v. United States, supra. While the New York statute
fixing the rate of interest is not controlling, the allowance
of interest does not conflict with any state or federal policy, and we think that, in the circumstances of this case,
a suitable rate is that prevailing in the state where the
obligation was given and to be performed. See Young v.
Godbe, supra, 565; Board of County Commissioners v.
United States, supra, 352.
Affirmed.
MR. JusTIcz BLACK, dissenting:

I agree with the Court's judgment that the Collector
of Internal Revenue did not have power to release a taxpayer from his obligation to pay, but I am unable to
agree with the Court's conclusions on the question of interest. The contract on which the Government's suit
rests contained no provision for interest. The state's interest law, according to the holding of the Court, is not
controlling. Congress has enacted no law requiring payment of interest and fixing an interest rate on contracts
guaranteeing tax payments. Nevertheless, this Court
now requires that interest be paid-a judicial requirement which under similar circumstances has been frankly
described as "judicial law-making." Board of County
Commissioners v. United States, 308 U. S. 343, 350.
Were the question an open one, I would be reluctant
to acquiesce in holding that federal courts, in the absence
of statutes, could or should assume the power to fix interest in such a case. But, granting that we have the
power to take this step, the rate of interest to be charged

BLACK, J., dissenting.

313 U. S.

is from necessity an element of the legislative and policy
power thus exercised, and that rate must therefore be determined by the Court. The rate fixed in this case is 6%.
Resolution as to the amount is rested in part at least on
New York's legislative rate. The inference is that a different rate might apply to contracts guaranteeing tax
payments made in other states. For it is well known
that interest rates fixed by state legislatures are not uniform but vary in amount.
Since in prescribing interest and fixing an interest rate
we are passing upon questions of public policy, not
marked at all by definite legislative boundaries, I find it
difficult to agree to the result here for two reasons: (1)
Unless the rate fixed is to be considered in the nature of a
penalty, 6% seems very high. A smaller rate would appear to come nearer to harmonizing with fair and equitable interest exactions. (2) I am of opinion that since
our "judicial law-making" is and must be national in its
scope, the law which we adopt fixing a rate of interest for
transactions such as that here involved should operate
with uniformity throughout the nation. Federal taxpayers or their sureties should not be required to pay 6%
in one state, 4% in a second, and 10% in a third. Such
varying rates are not subject to criticism by federal courts
if they govern local intrastate transactions subject to
state law. But it seems to me that federal taxpayers and
their sureties should be subject to the same interest rate
without regard to the state rates governing purely local
transactions within a particular area in which federal taxpayers happen to reside. To the extent that the Court's
opinion indicates the possibility of such a variance among
the states, I am compelled to disagree.
