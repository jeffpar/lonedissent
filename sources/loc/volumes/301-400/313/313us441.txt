descent and distribution of the property of decedents.
Accordingly, the time of acquisition of such property is
the death of the decedent, and its basis is the fair market value at the time of the decedent's death, regardless
of the time when the taxpayer comes into possession and
enjoyment of the property." It is upon this regulation
that the Court relies to justify its construction of the
statute.
I think the regulation plainly unjustified, as an attempt on the part of the Treasury to legislate when Congress has failed to do so. The hearings on the Revenue
Act of 1934 show that the Treasury was not satisfied with
the provision the Committee recommended Congress
should adopt and which Congress did adopt. It evi.dently attempted to rewrite the Congressional language
to carry out what it thought Congress should have provided. It needs no citation of authority to demonstrate
that such is not the function of a regulation and that
the attempt should fail.
The CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

CEBTIoRARI, 312 U. S. 675, to review judgments which
affirmed decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining
income tax assessments.
Mr. Roswell L. Gilpatric, with whom Mr. Joseph C.
White was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Thomas I. Emerson, with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs.
Sewall Key and Newton K. Fox were on the brief, for
respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Henry M. Flagler died on May 20, 1913. Petitioners
are legatees under a testamentary trust created under
his will. The trust continued for a period of ten years
from his death and terminated on May 20, 1923. As of
that time, the trustees delivered to petitioners' certain
securities which were sold by them in 1934 and 1936.
The question presented is whether the basis for computing gain or loss on such sales under § 113 (a) (5) of
the Revenue Acts of 1934 (48 Stat. 680) and 1936' (49
Stat. 1648) is the value of the securities when delivered
to the legatees, or their value on the date of death of
the decedent. Petitioners make substantially the same
Some securities had previously been delivered to Harry Harkness
Flagler, petitioner in No. 735, on April 26, 1921. Annie L. Flagler,
whose estate is the petitioner in No. 736, received the securities here
involved as a gift from her husband, Harry Harkness Flagler. The
situation therefore is the same as to both these parties since it is
stipulated that he had received the securities as indicated above.
2
Sec. 113 (a) (5) of the 1936 Act is the same as § 113 (a) (5)
of the 1934 Act. Art. 113 (a) (5)-l of Treasury Regulations 94,
promulgated under the 1936 Act, contains provisions identical with
those of Art. 113 (a) (5)-1 of Regulations 86 under the 1934 Act.
The relevant portions of that section and regulation under the 1934
Act are set forth in Helvering v. Reynolds, ante, p. 428.

argument for application of the former criterion as did
respondent in Helvering v. Reynolds, ante, p. 428. And
they contend that under Florida law they had at the
date of death only contingent interests. But assuming
they are correct in the latter contention, it is of no avail.
For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Reynolds, supra,
the proper basis was the value of the securities at the
death of the decedent. Accordingly, the judgments of
the court below (116 F. 2d 800) must be

UNITED STATES v. A. S. KREIDER CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 853. Argued May 7, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.

1. Section 24 (20) of the Judicial Code, which gives the District
Courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims over
certain suits against the United States, provides that no suit shall
be allowed thereunder unless the same shall have been brought
within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made.
Held, that the six-years period is an outside limit consistent with
the five-years limit on suits for the recovery of internal revenue
taxes set by § 1113 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, amending
R. S. § 3226. P. 446.
2. In response to a claim of tax refund, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue found an overpayment in the amount claimed and sent
the taxpayer a certificate of overassessment in that amount bearing
notation that a stated part of it was barred by limitations and
enclosed a check for the difference, which the taxpayer accepted.
Held, that there was no account stated upon which the taxpayer
could ground an action for the part not repaid and thus avoid the
five-years limitation of § 1113 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 on
suits to recover internal revenue taxes. Bonwi Teller & Co. v.
United States, 283 U. S. 258, distinguished. P. 448.
