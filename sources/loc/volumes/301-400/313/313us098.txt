be unreasonable but that 8 cents would be reasonable and would
produce the better revenue, fixed the fare at 8 cents. Held:
1. The question whether a 10 or an 8 cent fare would produce
more revenue was one of judgment upon evidence. P. 99.

APPEAL

PER CURIAM.

On July 31, 1937, appellant filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission a passenger tariff establishing a
fare of 10 cents for interstate transportation on its downtown line in lieu of the existing fare of 6 cents. The
Commission suspended the tariff and after full hearing
found that the revenue results to appellant would be
more favorable under an 8-cent fare than under a 10-cent
fare and further determined that the proposed 10-cent
fare would be unreasonable under §§ 1 and 15a of the

Opinion of the Court.

Interstate Commerce Act and that an 8-cent fare had
been justified.
The Commission directed the cancellation of the
schedule filed, without prejudice to the establishment
of an 8-cent fare, and accordingly, in July, 1938, appellant canceled its proposed tariff and put into effect a
fare of 8 cents. The Commission refused a rehearing.
In June, 1939, appellant brought this suit to set aside
the Commission's order. The case was heard in the
District Court by three judges upon the record made
before the Commission, and the court rendered its decision in June, 1940, holding that the findings of the
Commission were based upon substantial evidence and
that the order was within the Commission's authority,
was not confiscatory, and did not deprive appellant of
its property without due process of law. 33 F. Supp.
495.
As this Court has observed, "The raising of rates does
not necessarily increase revenue. It may in particular
localities reduce revenue instead of increasing it, by
discouraging patronage." Florida v. United States, 282
U. S. 194, 214. The effect of an increased rate of 10
cents as compared with one of 8 cents, with respect to
resulting revenues, was necessarily one of judgment upon
evidence and the Commission had evidence before it
with respect to traffic conditions in the area in question
and the extent of probable diversion of traffic if the fare
were increased to 10 cents. We conclude that in this
relation there was evidence to support the Commission's
findings and its findings supported its order.
The decree of the District Court is affirmed. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville
