which are otherwise within its lawful power. It is told
that it must get a fair rental value, and various criteria of
fairness are suggested. Thus, the court holds that Congress intended in such a situation to shackle the municipal
arm of a sovereign state, for the indefinite future, and compel it to conduct its business contrary to what the law of
its own state permits. This result cannot be justified in
the guise of preventing an alleged rebate of tariff rates by
a carrier, unconnected with and neither controlled by the
city nor exerting any legal control over the city, whose only
function is that of serving those who use the city's facilities.
I am of opinion that the bill should have been dismissed.

COMPANY v. STENTOR ELECTRIC
MANUFACTURING CO., INC.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 741.

Argued May 1, 2, 1941.-Decided June 2, 1941.

1. In diversity of citizenship cases, the federal courts, when deciding questions of conflict of laws, must follow the rules prevailing
in the States in which they sit. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64. P. 496.
2. In an action in a federal court, in Delaware, for breach of a
New York contract, the applicability of a New York statute
directing that interest be added to the recovery in contract cases
is a question of conflict of laws, which the federal court must
determine by the law of Delaware. P. 496.
3. The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require that a State,
contrary to its own policy, shall give effect in actions brought
locally on contracts made in other States, to laws of those States
relating, not to the validity of such contracts, but to the right
to add interest to the recovery as an incidental item of damages.

Supp. 425. The review in this Court was limited to the
question whether § 480 of the New York Civil Practice
Act is applicable to an action in the federal court in
Delaware.
Mr. John Thomas Smith for petitioner.
Section 480 of the New York Civil Practice Act relates
to procedure and remedy rather than to substantive
right. Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163;
Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 107 F. 2d 402, 418.
This Court's decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64, and the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, make it of paramount importance that the
distinction between substantive law and procedure be
kept clear.
The New York legislature regarded § 480 as a regulation of its own adjective law and not as a grant of
substantive right entitled to enforcement in foreign jurisdictions. See Matter of 1610 P, Inc., 168 Misc. 918; cf.,
Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v. Cortez Cigar Co., 92 F.
2d 882; Kline Bros. v. Royal Ins. Co., 192 F. 378.
There appears to be no Delaware decision as to
whether interest is substantive or procedural. It is
doubtful whether such a decision would be of binding
force on a federal court sitting in Delaware. Cf., Ruhlin
v. New York Life Ins. Co., 304 U. S. 202; E. E. Cheatham,
Sources of Rules for Conflict of Laws (1941), 89 U. of
Pa. L. R. 430, 446-7; Note (1939), 52 Harv. L. R. 1002.
By the preponderance of authority the matter of interest is deemed procedural and governed by the lex fori.

U. S. 343, 349, 350; Standard Oil Co. v. United States,

States, 61 F. 2d 587; Massachusetts Benefit Assn. v.
Miles, 137 U. S. 689.
Inconvenience and delay in the trial of cases involving
conflict of laws will result from a determination that
interest is substantive; controlling considerations of convenience and flexibility in judicial administration require
that interest be classified as procedural. Clark, Procedural Aspects of the New State Independence (1940), 8
Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1230, 1234; "The Tompkins Case and
the Federal Rules" (1941), 24 J. Am. Jurid. Soc. 158, 160.
In every such case in the federal District Court on a
cause of action arising elsewhere than at the forum the
court must determine the lex loci as a step preliminary
to the award or denial of interest as well as the rate
thereof and the period covered thereby. This must be
done even though the locus of the cause of action may be
unimportant for any other purpose in the case.
The conclusion of law as to the controlling locus must
be based on proof of facts frequently difficult to ascertain, e. g., in a contract action, the intention of the parties
as to where performance of the obligation involved
should take place.
It would be intolerable to have the lex loci determined
as it was in the case at bar. Here the place of performance was not considered an issue in the case until after
the verdict was rendered. The District Court considered
that interest was governed by the lex loci contractus. It
remained for the Circuit Court to find that the law of
the place of performance controlled the question. Under
these circumstances, naturally, no evidence was offered
by petitioner ta show that New York was not the in-

tended place of performance. The conclusion of the
courts below that New York was the place of performance of petitioner's obligation to use its best efforts to
exploit the patents rests on no factual support other than
collateral evidence offered on other issues.
The locus will often be a distant State. Its statute
books may be unavailable at the forum, especially if,
as here, the relevant provision is found in a Code of
Procedure. Or there may be no statutory provision
whatever, in which event the court must examine the
state decisions including those of the inferior courts if
the matter has not been settled by the State Supreme
Court. See West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 311 U. S.
223.
Delay will be the concomitant of the research and inquiry thus necessitated. Moreover, as the law of interest
in many States is obscure and confused, frequent appeals
with respect to the denial or award of interest pursuant
to state law must be expected.
A collateral effect of a determination that interest is
"substantive" is to cast doubt upon the validity of certain
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Clark, "The
Tompkins Case and the Federal Rules," 24 J. Am. Jurid.
Soc. 158, 161.
An independent federal rule regarding the allowance
of interest may be promulgated either by Congress, or
by this Court, or by the District Courts.
Pending the adoption of such a rule or as an alternative thereto, the District Courts are guided by the principles as to the allowance of interest which the federal
courts themselves have formulated. See Jones v. Foster,
70 F. 2d 200; Companhia de Navagacao Lloyd Brasileiro
v. C. G. Blake Co., 34 F. 2d 616.

Leahy, Henry Gale, and Abraham Friedmanwere on the

KLAXON CO. v. STENTOR CO.
487

Argument for Respondent.

No matter by what law the question is tested, the
courts below were right to apply the New York statute in adding interest to the amount of the verdict.
Under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, the
Delaware conflicts rule governs. The rule is (Restatement, Conflict of Laws, § 584; accord, 3 Beale, Conflict
of Laws, § 584.2, p. 1601) that "The court at the
forum determines according to its own Conflict of Laws
rule whether a given question is one of substance or
procedure." The doctrine of conflicts, however, is
"purely a question of local common law." Kryger v.
Wilson, 242 U. S. 171, 176; cf., 1 Beale, Conflict of Laws,
X, and § 5.1, p. 51. When this conflict question is presented, the federal court is bound to decide it according to the law of conflicts of the State in which it is
sitting. Sampson v. Channell, 110 F. 2d 754, 760-2,
cert. den., 310 U. S. 650; Waggaman v. General Finance
Co., 36 F. Supp. 85, 87; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws, 2d
Ed., p. 24; Comment, 4 Federal Rules Service Cases 1.3,
Case 1.
The Delaware conflicts rule is that damages for breach
of contract and the measure thereof are governed by the
lex loci-in our case the law of New York. Mackenzie
v. Omar, 4 Harr. (Del.) 435, 457; Ca?wdian Industrial
Alcohol Co. v. Nelson, 8 Harr. (Del.) 26, 58.
Moreover, it has been held in Delaware that the rate
of interest is governed by the lex loci. Barstow v.
Thatcher, 3 Houst. (Del.) 32; Mackenzie v. Omar, 4
Harr. (Del.) 435, 458-9.
It follows that the right to interest as an element of
damages is similarly governed. Cf., Curtis v.. Campbell,
76 F. 2d 84, cert. den., 295 U. S. 737.
The same result would have been reached if the courts
below had gone directly to the New York law, since the
measure of damages and the right to interest are substantive under New York law. Dyke v. Erie R. Co., 45

N. Y. 113, 118; Keifer v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 12 App.
Div. 28; Loucks v. Standard Oil Co., 224 N. Y. 99, 109;
Preston Co. v. Funkhouser,261 N. Y. 140, 145.
The classic distinction is between the nature, the obligation, and the interpretation of a contract, all of which
are the substance (Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co.
v. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 458), and "procedural"
matters-such as, for example, the form of the action,
as to whether it shall be assumpsit, covenant, or debt;
all process, both mesne and final; pleadings; and rules
of evidence. Pritchardv. Norton, 106 U. S. 124, 133-5.
The Delaware conflicts rule, that the measure of damages and interest are substantive and referable to the
lex loci, is supported by the weight of federal and other
authority. Restatement, Conflict of Laws, § 413; 2
Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 412.1, p. 1332; Chesapeake &
Ohio Ry. v. Kelly, 241 U. S. 485; Robertson, Characterization in the Conflict of Laws (Harv. Univ. Press, 1940)
270.
On the right to interest as part of the damages the
following federal decisions hold that the lex loci governs.
Freygang v. Vera Cruz & P. R. Co., 154 F. 640; Wynne
v. McCarthy, 97 F. 2d 964, 970; U. S. v. Garland,271 F.
14; cf., Curtis v. Campbell, 76 F. 2d 84; Bell v. Lamborn,
2 F. 2d 205.
The prevailing rule is that the lex loci governs. Scudder v. Union National Bank of Chicago, 91 U. S. 406;
Pana v. Bowler, 107 U. S. 529, 546; Scotland County v.
Hill, 132 U. S. 107, 117; Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co.

Sound reason and policy support the rule that the
right to interest is governed by the lex loci. Western
Union Tel. Co. v. Brown, 234 U. S. 542, 547; cf., Slater
v. Mexican Nat. Ry., 194 U. S. 120; Curtis v. Campbell,
76 F. 2d 84, 85; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, p. 699.
Since the New York statute is held substantive by
controlling New York decisions, the courts below would,
in any event, have been bound to apply that statute and
add interest to the amount of the verdict, under the
full faith and credit clause of the Constitution.
Bradford Elec. Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145, 155;
John Hancock Ins.' Co. v. Yates, 299 U. S. 178, 183.
Even before the amendment of § 480, N. Y. Civ. Pr.
Act, it had been held that the measure of damages and
the right to interest were of substance. The amendment acted upon a substantive right-the obligation of
the contract; it accomplished its purpose by making mandatory the addition of interest to damages for breach
of contract, whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co. v. Klaxon Co., 30 F.
Supp. 432; Preston Co. v. Funkhouser, 261 N. Y. 140;
Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163.
The construction placed upon § 480 by the New York
courts, and the New York rule that the right to interest
for breach of contract is a substantive right, are part of
the statute, as much so as though they were found in
appropriate words in its text. Georgia Ry. & Elec. Co.
v. Decatur, 295 U. S. 165, 170; West v. American Tel. &
Tel. Co., 311 U. S. 223.
The statute as thus construed is a substantive provision of every New York contract to which it is applicable,
such as the contract in the case at bar. The contractual
rights established thereby are rights of property, enforceable wherever the contract is sued upon. Loucks v.
Standard Oil Co., 224 N. Y. 99; Curtis v. Campbell,
76 F. 2d 84.

To deprive a party of the benefit of such property right
by refusing to give full faith and credit to the statute,
would be a violation of the constitutional rights of such
party. Bradford Elec. Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145;
John Hancock Ins. Co. v. Yates, 299 U. S. 178; Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629; cf. Sampson v. Channell,
110 F. 2d 754, 759.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
The principal question in this case is whether in diversity cases the federal courts must follow conflict of
laws rules prevailing in the states in which they sit. We
left this open in Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co.,
304 U. S. 202, 208, n. 2. The frequent recurrence of the
problem, as well as the conflict of approach to the problem between the Third Circuit's opinion here and that
of the First Circuit in Sampson v. Channell, 110 F. 2d
754, 759-62, led us to grant certiorari.
In 1918, respondent, a New York corporation, transferred its entire business to petitioner, a Delaware corporation. Petitioner contracted to use its best efforts
to further the manufacture and sale of certain patented
devices covered by the agreement, and respondent was to
have a share of petitioner's profits. The agreement was
executed in New York, the assets were transferred there,
and petitioner began performance there although later
it moved its operations to other states. Respondent was
voluntarily dissolved under New York law in 1919. Ten
years later it instituted this action in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that
petitioner had failed to perform its agreement to use its
best efforts. Jurisdiction rested on diversity of citizenship. In 1939 respondent recovered a jury verdict of
$100,000, upon which judgment was entered. Respondent then moved to correct the judgment by adding in-

terest at the rate of six percent from June 1, 1929, the
date the action had been brought. The basis of the motion was the provision in § 480 of the New York Civil
Practice Act directing that in contract actions interest
be added to the principal sum "whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated." 1 The District Court granted
the motion, taking the view that the rights of the parties
were governed by New York law and that under New
York law the addition of such interest was mandatory.
30 F. Supp. 425, 431. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed, 115 F. 2d 268, and we granted certiorari, limited
to the question whether § 480 of the New York Civil
Practice Act is applicable to an action in the federal
court in Delaware. 312 U. S. 674.
The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the view that
under New York law the right to interest before verdict
under § 480 went to the substance of the obligation, and
that proper construction of the contract in suit fixed
New York as the place of performance. It then concluded that § 480 was applicable to the case because "it
is clear by what we think is undoubtedly the better view
of the law that the rules for ascertaining the measure of
damages are not a matter of procedure at all, but are
'Section 480, New York Civil Practice Act:
"Interest to be included in recovery. Where in any action, except
as provided in section four hundred eighty-a, final judgment is rendered for a sum of money awarded by a verdict, report or decision,
interest upon the total amount awarded, from the time when the
verdict was rendered or the report or decision was made to the time
of entering judgment, must be computed by the clerk, added to the
total amount awarded, and included in the amount of the judgment.
In every action wherein any sum of money shall be awarded by
verdict, report or decision upon a cause of action for the enforcement of or based upon breach of performance of a contract, express or implied, interest shall be recovered upon the principal sum
whether theretofore liquidated or unliquidated and shall be added
to and be a part of the total sum awarded."

matters of substance which should be settled by reference
to the law of the appropriate state according to the type
of case being tried in the forum. The measure of damages for breach of a contract is determined by the law of
the place of performance; Restatement, Conflict of Laws
§ 413." The court referred also to § 418'of the Restatement, which makes interest part of the damages to be
determined by the law of the place of performance. Application of the New York statute apparently followed
from the court's independent determination of the "better
view" without regard to Delaware law, for no Delaware
decision or statute was cited or discussed.
We are of opinion that the prohibition declared in Erie
R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, against such independent determinations by the federal courts, extends
to the field of conflict of laws. The conflict of laws rules
to be applied by the federal court in Delaware must conform to those prevailing in Delaware's state courtsOtherwise, the accident of diversity of citizenship would
constantly disturb equal administration of justice in coordinate state and federal courts sitting side by side.
See Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, at 74-77. Any
other ruling would do violence to the principle of uniformity within a state, upon which the Tompkins decision is based. Whatever lack of uniformity this may
produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state,
within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right
to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. It is not for the federal courts to thwart such local
policies by enforcing an independent "general law" of
conflict of laws. Subject only to review by this Court
'An opinion in Sampson v. Channell, 110 F. 2d 754, 759-62, reaches
the same conclusion, as does an opinion of the Third Circuit handed
down subsequent to the case at bar, Waggaman v. General Finance
Co., 116 F. 2d 254. 257. See also Goodrich, Conflict of Laws, § 12.

KLAXON CO. v. STENTOR CO.
487

Opinion of the Court.

on any federal question that may arise, Delaware is free
to determine whether a given matter is to be governed
by the law of the forum or some other law. Cf. Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 272. This
Court's views are not the decisive factor in determining the applicable conflicts rule. Cf. Funkhouserv. J. B.
Preston Co., 290 U. S. 163. And the proper function of
the Delaware federal court is to ascertain what the state
law is, not what it ought to be.
Besides these general considerations, the traditional
treatment of interest in diversity cases brought in the federal courts points to the same conclusion. Section 966
of the Revised Statutes, 28 U. S. C. § 811, relating to interest on judgments, provides that it be calculated from
the date of judgment at such rate as is allowed by law on
judgments recovered in the courts of the state in which
the court is held. In Massachusetts Benefit Association
v. Miles, 137 U. S. 689, this Court held that § 966 did not
exclude the allowance of interest on verdicts as well as
judgments, and the opinion observed that "the courts of
the state and the federal courts sitting within the state
should be in harmony upon this point" (p. 691).
Looking then to the Delaware cases, petitioner relies
on one group to support his contention that the Delaware
state courts would refuse to apply § 480 of the New York
Civil Practice Act, and respondent on another to prove
the contrary. We make no analysis of these Delaware decisions, but leave this for the Circuit Court of Appeals
when the case is remanded.
Respondent makes the further argument that the judgment must be affirmed because, under the full faith and
credit clause of the Constitution, the state courts of Delaware would be obliged to give effect to the New York
statute. The argument rests mainly on the decision of
this Court in JohnHancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Yates,
326252-41-32

313 U. S.

299 U. S. 178, where a New York statute was held such an
integral part of a contract of insurance, that Georgia was
compelled to sustain the contract under the full faith and
credit clause. Here, however, § 480 of the New York Civil
Practice Act is in no way related to the validity of the
contract in suit, but merely to an incidental item of damages, interest, with respect to which courts at the forum
have commonly been free to apply their own or some other
law as they see fit. Nothing in the Constitution ensures
unlimited extraterritorial recognition of all statutes or of
any statute under all circumstances. Pacific Employers
Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U. S.
493; Kryger v. Wilson, 242 U. S. 171. The full faith and
credit clause does not go so far as to compel Delaware to
apply § 480 if such application would interfere with its
local policy.
Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for decision in
conformity with the law of Delaware.
