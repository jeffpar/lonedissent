testimony, himself have -ound the facts and based his
disposition of the cause upon his findings. The petitioner has not been afforded the right of testifying before
the judge, which the statute plainly accords him. In
order that he may have that right we reverse the judgment and remapd the cause to the District Court for
further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. We
express no opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of the
evidence heretofore adduced. The issues of fact will be
for solution by the District Court upon a further

BROOKS v. DEWAR ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEVADA.

No. 718. Argued May 1, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.
1. The judgment being erroneous on the merits, the Court abstains
from inquiring whether this suit to enjoin a subordinate federal
officer from alleged invasion of plaintiff's rights under color of a
federal statute but without authority, is a suit against the United

States, or whether the Secretary of the Interior should have been
joined as a necessary party defendant, or whether the state court
was without power to enjoin a federal officer. P. 359.

2. In administering the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934, the
Secretary of the Interior, relying on the broad powers conferred by

§ 2, issued temporary licenses to stockowners, for the grazing of
their livestock upon the public lands within grazing districts, and
charged a uniform price per head, rather than have the grazing

lands go unregulated pending the lengthy period required for instituting the plan, contemplated by § 3, of renewable term permits at
reasonable fees adjusted to each case, etc. With full knowledge of
this, Congress repeatedly appropriated part of the money thus
brought into the Treasury for expenditure by the Secretary in improvement of the ranges. Held, that the Secretary's construction
of the statute wap thereby confirmed and his action as agent of

CEoRIORAI, 312 U. S. 674, to review the affirmance of
a decree of injunction, entered upon the overruling of a
demurrer to the bill.
Mr. Warner W. Gardner,with whom Solicitor General
Biddle, Assistant Attorney General Littell, and Mr. Vernon L. Wilkinson were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Milton B. Badt, with whom Messrs. William J.
Donovan, R. R. Irvine, and John Howley were on the
brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The respondents brought suit in a Nevada District
Court to enjoin the petitioner from barring, or threatening to bar, them from grazing their livestock within Nevada Grazing District, No. 1 in default of the payment
of certain grazing fees and in default of their holding a
license permitting such use of the public lands by them.
The bill alleged that the respondents were, and for years
had been, in the business of breeding, raising, grazing,
and selling livestock within Nevada and within the district; that it was impossible for them to own or lease all
the land needed for their business and they owned or
leased a small portion of the required land and used
vacant unappropriated and unreserved public lands of
the United States to satisfy the remainder of their grazing requirements; that their financial and business necessities made it impossible to continue to operate if
their ability to graze their livestock on the public range
were seriously impaired or interfered with. They averred
that, until May 31, 1935, they had been impliedly li-

censed by the United States to graze livestock on portions of the public range in Nevada.' They recited the
passage by Congress of an Act of June 28, 1934,2 and
alleged that, on April 8, 1935, the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, established a grazing district known as Nevada Grazing
District No. 1, which included portions of the public
range upon which the respondents had theretofore grazed
their livestock and that, on May 31, 1935, the Director
of Grazing, with the approval of the Secretary, had promulgated rules which required all persons grazing within
the district to obtain temporary licenses so to do, for
which no fees were to be paid; that, pursuant to the
rules, the respondents obtained temporary licenses; that,
on March 2, 1936, after an investigation by the Secretary, the Director of Grazing, with the approval of his
superior, purporting to act under the authority of § 2 of
the Act of June 28, 1934, promulgated rules for the administration of grazing districts, which provided for the
issue of temporary licenses to expire on a date named in
1937 or upon the issue of permits provided for by § 3
of the Act, for which licenses graziers were to pay a fee
of five cents per month for each head of cattle and a fee of
one cent per month for each head of sheep for the privilege of grazing; that the rules further provided that,
after issue of the temporary licenses, no stockman should
graze livestock upon, nor drive them across, the public
range within a grazing district without a license. The
complaint recited that, about May 1, 1936, the respondents were notified by the Register of the District Land
Office that licenses would be granted them upon payment
of the first installment of the grazing fees, and that

shortly thereafter the defendant, Brooks, who was acting as Regional Grazier of the United States, notified the
respondents that unless they paid the installments and
obtained licenses by June 15th they would be considered
in trespass under the terms of the Act of 1934 and would
be punished by fine as provided in the Act. The respondents alleged with particularity the urgent necessity
in the conduct of their business that they be permitted
to graze their cattle on public lands and that, unless they
can do so, they will suffer irreparable and serious damage
due to the destruction of their businesses. The bill
charges that although the Secretary in promulgating the
rules with respect to temporary licenses purported to act
under the authority of § 2 of the Act of 1934, that section confers upon him no power so to do and that grazing
fees specified by the rules were fixed without any attempt
to determine their amounts as required by § 3 of the
Act and in violation of conditions prescribed by § 3.
The petitioner demurred and assigned as reasons that
the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute.
a cause of action against him; that there was a defect of
parties defendant for failure to join the Secretary of the
Interior; that as the United States, an indispensable
party, had not consented to be sued, the court was without jurisdiction; and that the subject matter of the complaint was exclusively within the political power of the
United States and not subject to judicial review. The
court overruled the demurrer, with leave to answer. The
petitioner elected to stand upon his demurrer, and the
court thereupon entered a decree in favor of the respondents, which the Supreme Court of Nevada affirmed.'
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the
questions involved.
By § 1 of the Act of 1934, the Secretary of the Interior
is authorized to establish grazing districts not exceeding

in the aggregate an area of 80,000,000 acres out of certain unappropriated and unreserved public lands of the
United States 4 if the lands, in his opinion, are chiefly
valuable for grazing and raising forage crops. Before
any district is created a hearing is to be held after notice
at which officials and persons interested are to be heard.
Section 2 provides:
"The Secretary of the Interior shall make provision
for the protection, administration, regulation, and improvement of such grazing districts as may be created
under the authority of the foregoing section, and he shall
make such rules and regulations and establish such service, enter into such cooperative agreements, and do any
and all things necessary to accomplish the purposes of
this Act and to insure the objects of such grazing districts, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use, to
preserve the land and its resources from destruction or
unnecessary injury, to provide for the orderly use, improvement, and development of the range; . . . and any

-willful violation of the provisions of this Act or of such
rules and regulations thereunder after actual notice
thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than
$500."
Section 3 authorizes the Secretary to issue permits to
graze livestock in grazing districts "upon the payment
annually of reasonable fees in each case to be fixed or
determined from time to time." It commands that preference be given, in the issue of permits, to certain persons
described in the section and that no permittee who complies with the rules and regulations of the Secretary
shall be denied the renewal of his permit if such denial
will impair the value of the permittee's grazing unit
when such unit is pledged as security for any bona fide
loan. The permits are to be for a period of not more

than ten years, subject to the preferential right of the
permittee to renewal in the discretion of the Secretary.
There are other provisions for adjustment of the amount
of grazing to be permitted under the permits, and a corresponding adjustment of the grazig fees in the case of
the occurrence of range depletion due to natural causes.
By § 10 it is provided that all moneys received under
the authority of the Act are to be deposited in the Treasury of the United States, and twenty-five per cent. of
such moneys received from any district in a fiscal year
is made available, when appropriated by the Congress,
for expenditure by the Secretary for range improvements, and fifty per cent. of such money received from
a district in any fiscal year is to be paid, at the end of
the year, by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the State in
which the grazing district is situated, to be expended by
the State for the benefit of the counties in which the
district lies.'
The petitioner asserts that the judgment below should
be reversed because the suit is one against the United
States; because the Secretary of the Interior is an
indispensable party, and because the state court
was without power to enjoin a federal officer. He admits that earlier cases in this Court are against his contention but relies on others which he says sustain his
view. As this Court remarked nearly sixty years ago
respecting questions of this kind, they "have rarely been
free from difficulty" and it is not "an easy matter to
reconcile all the decisions of the court in this class of
cases." 6 The statement applies with equal force at this
day. We are not disposed to attempt a critique of the
"By § 11 provision is made for disposition of moneys received
from districts located on Indian lands. Twenty-five per cent. is

authorities. Since the jurisdiction and the procedure
of the court below are sustained by decisions of this Court,
we are unwilling to base our judgment upon a resolution
of asserted conflict touching issues of so grave consequence, where, as here, the bill fails to make a case upon
the merits.
The respondents say that, under the Act of 1934, the
Secretary is powerless to grant temporary licenses and
charge fees therefor; that his sole authority is to issue
permanent permits for specified periods not to exceed
ten years, at fees adjusted to the circumstances of individual permittees, and with preferential rights of renewal. If this view be correct, it might well be years
before the Secretary could place the users of lands in any
district under permits. The petitioner asserts that it
was not the intent of Congress that the grazing lands
should go unregulated and without license for any such
extensive period as would be required for the issue of
permits under § 3. He relies on the broad powers conferred by § 2, and points out that the section is a replica of the statute involved in United States v. Grimaud,
220 U. S.506, and there held to authorize similar rules
and regulations.
With knowledge that the Department of the Interior
was issuing temporary licenses instead of term permits
and that uniform fees were being charged and collected
for the issue of temporary licenses, Congress repeatedly
appropriated twenty-five per cent. of the money thus
coming into the Treasury for expenditure by the Secretary
in improvements upon the ranges.' The information in

the possession of Congress was plentiful and from various
sources. It knew from the annual reports of the Secretary
of the Interior that a system of temporary licensing was
in force.8 The same information was furnished the Appropriations Committee at its hearings.' Not only was it
disclosed by the annual report of the Department that
no permits were issued in 1936, 1937, and 1938, and that
permits were issued in only one district in 1939, but it was
also disclosed in the hearings that uniform fees were being
charged and collected for the issue of temporary licenses.
And members from the floor informed the Congress that
the temporary licensing system was in force and that as
much as $1,000,000 had been or would be collected in fees
for such liceises.'0 The repeated appropriations of the
proceeds of the fees thtis covered, and to be covered, into
the Treasury, not only confirms the departmental construction of the statute," but constitutes a ratification of
the action of the Secretary as the agent of Congress in
the administration of the act."2
