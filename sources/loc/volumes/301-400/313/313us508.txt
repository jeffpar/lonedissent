OKLAHOMA Ex EL. PHILLIPS, GOVERNOR, v.
GUY F. ATKINSON CO. ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 832. Argued May 6, 7, 1941.-Decided June 2, 1941.
1. The Denison Dam and Reservoir Project on the Red River in
Oklahoma and Texas, authorized by the Act of June 28, 1938,
is a valid exercise of the commerce power by Congress. P. 516.
This is a multi-purpose project-part of a comprehensive scheme
for controlling floods in the Mississippi River through reservoir
control of its tributaries, of which the Red River is one of the
more important. It aims also to protect and improve navigation of
the Red River itself on its navigable stretches (which lie below
the State of Oklahoma) by averting damaging floods and by regulating stream-flow; and it provides means for creating hydroelectric power, the disposition of which will offset some of the
costs of the flood-control and of the stream-flow regulation.
2. The fact that portions of a navigable stream are no longer used
for commerce does not dilute the power of Congress over them.
P. 523.
3. Congress may control non-navigable parts of a river in order
to preserve and promote commerce on the navigable parts. P. 523.
4. The power of Congress, under the Commerce Clause, to protect
a navigable river from floods extends to the control of waters of
its tributaries. P. 525.
5. The exercise of the granted power to regulate interstate commerce
may be aided by appropriate and needful control of activities and
agencies which, though intrastate, affect that commerce. P. 526.
6. It is for Congress alone to decide whether a particular project,
by itself or as part of a more comprehensive scheme, will have
such a beneficial effect on the arteries of interstate commerce as
to warrant it. P. 527.
It is not for the Court to determine whether the resulting benefits to commerce will outweigh the costs of the project. Nor
may the Court inquire into the considerations or objectives which
moved members of Congress to vote for the project.
7. Inclusion of the water-power feature in the Denison project,
thereby increasing the height of the dam and the area of land to be

taken for the reservoir, did not exceed the authority of Congress.
The project is basically one of flood-control including river-flow,
and those functions are interrelated with the power function. P. 529.
8. Whether the work of flood-control would be better done by a
dam of one design or another, was for Congress to determine.
P. 533.
9. As respects the authority of Congress to adopt a plan for floodcontrol, it is not an objection that it will also serve other ends
which may be relatively more important. P. 534.
10. The Tenth Amendment does not deprive the National Government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a
granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the
permitted end. P. 534.
11. Construction of the Denison Dam and Reservoir does not interfere with the sovereignty of Oklahoma. P. 534.
12. The facts that land included in a federal reservoir project is owned
by a State, or that its taking may impair the tax revenue of the
State, and that the reservoir will obliterate part of the State's
boundary, and that the State's own project for water development
and conservation will be interfered with-constitute no barrier to
condemnation of the land by the United States under its superior
power of eminent domain. P. 534.
37 F. Supp. 93, affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree dismissing on motion a bill
through which the State of Oklahoma sought to enjoin
the construction, pursuant to an Act of Congress, of a

dam and reservoir, upon the ground that the Act and
the project exceeded the power of Congress and were contrary to the sovereign and proprietary rights of the State.

Assistant Attorney General of Oklahoma, with whom
Messrs. Mac Q. Williamson, Attorney General, and
William 0. Coe were on the brief, for appellant.

Gardner and Richard H. Demuth were on the brief, for
respondents.

Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case involves primarily the constitutionality of the
Act of June 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 1215) insofar as it authorizes
the construction of the Denison Reservoir on Red River
in Texas and Oklahoma.1
'The Act provides in part:
"See. 4. That the following works of improvement for the benefit of
navigation and the control of destructive floodwaters and other purposes are hereby adopted and authorized to be prosecuted under the
direction of the Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers in accordance with the plans in the respective reports hereinafter designated: Provided, That penstocks or other similar facilities
adapted to possible future use in the development of hydroelectric
power shall be installed in any dam herein authorized when approved
by the Secretary of War upon the recommendation of the Chief of
Engineers and of the Federal Power Commission.
"The Denison Reservoir on Red River in Texas and Oklahoma for
flood control and other purposes as described in House Document Numbered 541, Seventy-fifth Congress, third session, with such modifications thereof as in the discretion of the Secretary of War and the Chief
of Engineers may be advisable, is adopted and authorized at an estimated cost of $54,000,000 ...
"The Government of the United States acknowledges the right of
the States of Oklahoma and Texas to continue to exercise all existing
proprietary or other rights of supervision of and jurisdiction over the
waters of all tributaries of Red River within their borders above Denison Dam site and above said dam, if and when constructed, in the
same manner and to the same extent as is now or may hereafter be
provided by the laws of said States, respectively, and all of said laws
as they now exist or as same may be hereafter amended or enacted
and all rights thereunder, including the rights to impound or authorize
the retardation or impounding thereof for flood control above the said
Denison Dam and to divert the same for municipal purposes, domestic
uses, and for irrigation, power generation, and other beneficial uses,
shall be and remain unaffected by or as a result hereof. All such rights

OKLAHOMA v. ATKINSON CO.
508

Opinion of the Court.

The bill in equity was filed by the State of Oklahoma
seeking to enjoin the construction of any dam across Red
River within the domain of Oklahoma which would impound the waters of the Red River (or its tributary,
Washita River) so as to inundate and destroy any of the
lands, highways or bridges belonging to or under the jurisdiction and control of the state, or which would obliterate
or interfere with its boundaries. The bill also seeks to restrain the institution or conduct in any court in Oklahoma
of proceedings to condemn lands for the purpose of the
dam or reservoir.2
The bill alleges that Oklahoma will be injured in the following manner by construction of the project: The greater
part of the dam will rest on Oklahoma soil and will form
a reservoir inundating about 150,000 acres of land, of
which 100,000 acres are located in Oklahoma. Of those
acres about 3,800 are owned by the state. The United
States will acquire title to the inundated land. The land
owned by the state is used for school purposes, for a prison
farm, for highways, rights of way, and bridges. The basin
to be inundated is inhabited by about 8,000 Oklahoma
citizens. Much of the land is rich soil in a high state of
are hereby saved and reserved for and to the said States and the people
and the municipalities thereof, and the impounding of any such waters
for any and all beneficial uses by said States or under their authority
may be as freely done after the passage hereof as the same may now be
done."
In October, 1939, the State of Oklahoma filed with this Court a motion for leave to fie a bill of complaint seeking an injunction against the
then Secretary of War from proceeding with the construction of this
project. The motion for leave to file was denied by an equally divided
court. Oklahoma v. Woodring, 309 U. S. 623.
'Appellees are Guy F. Atkinson Co., alleged to be constructing the

dam under a contract with the War Department; and Cleon A. Summers and Curtis P. Harris, who as attorneys for the government are

alleged to have instituted numerous condemnation suits for the purposes of the proposed reservoir.

cultivation. Much of it has large potential oil reserves.
On some of it there are large producing oil wells and on
other parts there are drilling operations and exploration
for oil and gas. At least 15,000 acres will be highly productive oil lands and at least 50,000 acres are underlaid
with oil and gas. There are thirty-nine school districts
and townships in the four counties in which the affected
area is located. Those governmental units are largely
supported by ad valorem taxes. The taking of the 100,000 acres will decrease the taxable property in each of the
counties and take virtually all of the taxable property in
many of the townships and school districts. Each of these
governmental units has a large bonded indebtedness payable from an annual levy of taxes. Inundation of the land
will deprive those units of much of the tax revenue, so that
many will be practically destroyed and the remainder
seriously hampered. Since the state derives much of its
revenue from a gross production tax on oil and gas, it will
suffer great losses in tax revenues from the inundation of
the oil and gas lands. The "annual wealth production"
to the citizens of Oklahoma from the lands in the reservoir
basin is about $1,500,000. Aside from such losses and
losses from oil revenues and personal property taxation,
the net taxable loss to the counties, townships and school
districts will be about $40,000 annually.
It is also alleged that the construction of the dam will
be a "direct invasion and destruction" of the sovereign and
proprietary rights of Oklahoma in that: the boundary of
Oklahoma will be obliterated for approximately 40 miles
(see Oklahoma v. Texas, 260 U. S. 606); there will be a
"forcible reduction of the area of plaintiff as one of the
United States"; lands owned by it will be taken; its highways and bridges will be destroyed causing an interruption in communication between various parts of the state;
the waters to be impounded belong to Oklahoma but will
be taken from it without payment of just compensation;

OKLAHOMA v. ATKINSON CO.
508

Opinion of the Court.

those waters will be diverted from Oklahoma and will be
run through turbines located in Texas for the generation
of power for sale principally in Texas; the removal of citizens from the 100,000 acres of land will create a "serious
social and economic problem," the burden of which will
fall on Oklahoma for which no compensation is afforded.
The bill incorporates H. Doe. No. 541, 75th Cong., 3d
Sess. (hereinafter called the Report), which contains the
War Department's survey and recommendations on the
Denison Reservoir and which served as the broad definition of the project which was authorized by the Act of June
28, 1938. The bill alleges that under the statutory
scheme flood control and power purposes are "inextricably
and inseverably involved." It alleges that, as described
in the Report, the first 110 feet of the dam are to be used
"solely and exclusively for the development of waterpower," while 40 feet "superimposed" on the power reservoir are to be used "solely and exclusively" for flood
control. That is to say, from elevation 510 feet (sea level)
to 590 feet there is to be a dead storage pool for waterpower head, from 595 feet to 620 feet there is to be a water
power reservoir, and from 620 feet to 660 feet there is to be
a flood-control reservoir. It is alleged that those purposes are "functionally separate and neither is the incidental or necessary result of the other"; that the same
part of the reservoir will not and cannot be used for both
flood control and waterpower purposes; and that the
power portion of the dam is created at the expense of its
utilization for flood control. The bill further alleges that
as a result of the modification of the statutory plan set
forth in the Report the dam is being constructed so as to
provide dead storage for water head from 510 feet to 567
feet, a power pool reservoir from 587 feet to 617 feet, and
a flood-control reservoir from 617 feet to 640 feet. It is
alleged that by reason of that modification the reservoir

will inundate 3,080,000 acre feet for power and 2,745,000
acre feet for flood control, as contrasted to 3,400,000 acre
feet for power and 5,900,000 acre feet for flood control under the original plan;' and that, as a result, the statutory
'Inthis connection it is alleged that under the statutory scheme
75% of the height of the dam is for power and 25% for flood control,
and 37% of the acre feet inundated is for water storage for power and
63% for flood control, while under the modified plan 82% of the height
of the dam is for power and 18% for flood control, and 53% of the
acre feet inundated is for water storage for power and 47% for flood
control.
The original plan or statutory scheme as set forth in the Report (H.
Doc. No. 541, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 45) was described therein as
follows:
"The project plan as designed for the combined flood control and
power-development scheme with top of dam at elevation 695 is based
upon the following allocation of reservoir capacity, the volumes being
given in round figures.
"(a) Dead storage.-Stream bed elevation 505 to lower power pool
elevation 595, 1,400,000 acre feet.
"(b) Power pool storage.-Elevation 595 to elevation 620, 2,000,000
acre-feet.
"(c) Flood pool storage.--Elevation 620 to crest of spillway, elevation 660, 5,900,000 acre feet.
"(d) Detention flood storage.--Storage above the spillway crest, elevation 660, to the maximum reservoir surface reached by the impounded
floodwaters, which in the case of the project flood would be 6,400,000
acre-feet for elevation 687."
Under § 4 of the Act of June 28, 1938, the Secretary of War and the
Chief of Engineers were authorized to modify the project as it was
described in the Report. A modification has been made. Definite
Project for Denison Dam & Reservoir, Red River, Corps of Engineers,
U. S. Army (not printed). Those changes were reported to a committee of Congress. Hearings, S. Subcom. on Appropriations, H. R.
6260, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 25-26, 201. Under the Definite Project
(pp. 10-14) the following allocation of reservoir capacity has been
made:
(a) Dead Storage. Stream bed elevation 505 to lower power pool
elevation 587, 1,020,000 acre feet.

Opinion of the Court.

scheme has been changed from one preponderantly for
flood control to one preponderantly for water power. It
is also alleged that no part of the Red River in Oklahoma
is navigable.
The bill alleges that the Act under which appellees are
proceeding is unconstitutional in that it violates the
Tenth Amendment, that it is not within the powers of
Congress conferred by Art. I, § 8 of the Federal Constitution, and that since appellees are acting under a void
and unconstitutional statute they should be enjoined.
By an amendment to its bill, the State of Oklahoma also
challenges the constitutionality of § 4 of the Act of
October 17, 1940, c. 895, 54 Stat. 1198.' The amended
bill alleges that the project "does not in any way protect or improve the navigable portions of the lower
reaches of Red river or of the Mississippi river either by
enriching the lower water flow . . . as the incidental
result of the operation of said flood control and hydroelectric power project, except in the intangible, indirect,
inconsequential and unsubstantial way" set forth in the
Report; and that such inconsequential and intangible
benefits to navigation as may result will flow from the
flood control, not the power feature, of the project.
(b) Power pool storage. Elevation 587 to elevation 617, 2,060,000
acre feet.
(c) Flood pool storage. Elevation 617 to spillway crest, elevation
640, 2,745,000 acre feet.
(d) Detention flood storage. Elevation spillway crest, 640, to crest
of dam, 670. Appellees on the basis of Definite Project, Appendix A,
Plate A-23, place the acre feet at approximately 3,300,000 for elevation
662-the condition which, it is asserted, will exist in case of the
maximum probable flood.
'That section provides: "The project for the Denison Reservoir
on Red River in Texas and Oklahoma, authorized by the Flood Control Act approved June 28, 1938, is hereby declared to be for the
purpose of improving navigation, regulating the flow of the Red
River, controlling floods, and for other beneficial uses."

By motions to dismiss, the appellees asserted, inter
alia, that the Acts of Congress so challenged were con9titutional and valid. The case was heard by a threejudge court (Act of August 24, 1937, c. 754, § 3, 50 Stat.
751, 28 U. S. C. § 38Oa) which sustained the Act authorizing the project. 37 F. Supp. 93. From a judgment
dismissing the complaint and denying the injunction, a
direct appeal was taken to this Court.
We are of the view that the Denison Dam and Reservoir project is a valid exercise of the commerce power
by Congress.
This project is a part of a rather recent chapter in the
long history of flood control on the Mississippi River.5
The Federal Government had concerned itself with the
problems of navigation and flood control on that river
long before 6 the establishment of the Mississippi River
Commission (21 Stat. 37) in 1879. Earlier efforts towards a more comprehensive flood-control program on a
national scale I were accelerated by the disastrous Mis5

sissippi flood in 1927. The agitation and concern over
that disaster I led to the enactment of the Flood Control
Act of May 15, 1928 (45 Stat. 534), § 10 of which provided that the Secretary of War should submit to Congress "at the earliest practicable date projects for flood
control on all tributary streams of the Mississippi River
system subject to destructive floods which projects shall
include: The Red River and tributaries . . ." That section of the Act also required a report on the effect on
flood control of the lower Mississippi to be attained
through the use of a reservoir system, the "benefits that
will accrue to navigation and agriculture" from the prevention of siltage and erosion, the "prospective income
from the disposal of reservoired waters," and "inquiry
as to the return flow of waters placed in the soils from
reservoirs, and as to their stabilizing effect on stream
flow as a means of preventing erosion, siltage, and improving navigation." Pursuant to that authorization
and direction, a report (H. Doc. No. 378, 74th Cong.,
2d Sess.) was submitted on December 2, 1935, dealing at
great length with the problems of the Red River and its
tributaries, and their relationship with the Mississippi.
On June 22, 1936, there was enacted 9 the Flood Control Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 1570). Sec. 1 of that Act set

forth a broad Congressional policy, stating, inter alia,
that "the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their
tributaries, including watersheds-thereof, for flood-control
purposes if th-benefits to whomsoever they may accrue
are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and
social security of people are otherwise adversely affected"
and that "destructive floods upon the rivers of the United
States, upsetting orderly processes and causing loss of life
and property, including the erosion of lands, and impairing and obstructing navigation, highways, railroads,
and other channels of commerce between the States, constitute a menace to national welfare." That Act authorized the construction of various flood-control projects.
By § 7 of that Act the Secretary of War was authorized
and directed to continue the investigation of other projects, including the Denison Reservoir, where "opportunities appear to exist for useful flood-control operations
with economical development of hydroelectric power
whenever sufficient markets to absorb such power become
available."
Following the disastrous Ohio River flood in January,
1937, the House Committee on Flood Control requested 11
the Chief of Engineers to submit "comprehensive plans
for protective works against floods in the Ohio Valley"
and plans "to further insure protection in the Mississippi
Valley." He submitted a report pursuant to that direction, and recommended the construction of 45 flood-control reservoirs on the tributaries of the Ohio and 24 on
other tributaries of the Mississippi, including the Red
River." As to the proposed Denison Reservoir, he stated
that it "would remove the threat of the coincidence of a

large flood from the Red with a flood in the Mississippi,
and would also afford highly desirable protection to the
fertile bottom lands in the lower Red River Valley. Besides its flood-control benefits, it has valuable potentiality for power purposes." 1 And he added: "On the Red
River . . . investigations indicate that a flood far exceeding any of record is distinctly possible. The Denison Reservoir would prevent such a flood from reaching
disastrous proportions in the valley below it." 13
On March 12, 1938, the Acting Secretary of War
transmitted to Congress a report from the Chief of
Engineers, United States Army, pursuant to the direction contained in § 7 of the Flood Control Act of 1936.
That Report, being the one here involved, (H. Doc. No.
541, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.) recommended the construction
of a dam near Denison, Texas, for the combined purpose
of flood control and development of hydroelectric power.
After hearings," Congress passed the Flood Control Act
of 1938, here challenged, which authorized,"' inter alia,
the Denison project on the basis of the Report and at

Act of October 17, 1940, also challenged by appellant,
declaring the Denison Reservoir to be "for the purpose
of improving navigation, regulating the flow of the Red
River, controlling floods, and for other beneficial uses." "
Thus, while the Report spoke of the dam as a "dual
purpose" project, Congress did not so limit it but authorized it for multiple purposes.
-From this history it is plain that this project, which is
part of a comprehensive flood-control plan, is designed to
control the watershed of one of the principal tributaries
of the Mississippi in alleviation of floods in the lower Red
River and Mississippi valleys. The Red River, sixth in
length among rivers in the United States, has one of the
largest watersheds in the country, draining an area about
50 per cent larger than New England-an area of 91,430
square miles, of which 38,291 square miles are above the
dam site. 8 It rises near the east edge of New Mexico, flows
easterly about 850 miles across the Texas Panhandle and
between the States of Oklahoma and Texas to Fulton,
Arkansas. From there it flows south and southeast some
460 miles and enters the Mississippi at Red River Landing.
The site of the Denison dam is 228 miles up the river from
Fulton. 'The contribution which the Red River makes to
disastrous floods in its basin and in the lower Mississippi
has long been recognized. Huge crop damage, the loss of
buildings, bridges and livestock, pollution of fertile fields,
the erosion of rich farm lands, bank cavings, interruption
of navigation, injury of port facilities, the creation of sand
bars in the channels, interruption or stoppage of interstate transportation by rail, truck and motorcar, disease,
pestilence and death, relief of the homeless and destituteall these are now familiar costs of the floods on the Missis"See note 4, supra.

sippi. 9 And the history of the Red River valley shows
that it has long been plagued by such disasters and bur20
dened by their costs.
Floods pay no respect to state lines.21 Their effective
control in the Mississippi valley has become increasingly
a subject of national concern, " in recognition of the fact
'As respects the January, 1937 Ohio River flood, the Chief of Engineers reported in April, 1937: "The river rose to a height of 80 feet
above low water at Cincinnati, being nearly 9 feet above any flood
heretofore of record. The resulting damage was enormous. Practically every community along the entire river suffered heavy loss.
Water, electricity, and gas services were discontinued in many cities.
More than 500,000 persons were driven from their homes and suffered
great discomfort and distress. Highway and railway communications
were severed and business and industrial activities were completely disrupted for several weeks. Relief agencies were taxed to the utmost
to provide for the flood refugees. Although the direct damages have
not yet been fully ascertained, they may conservatively be estimated
at more than $400,000,000. The War Department expended more
than $5,000,000 in relief work and in providing supplies and materials
for the flood areas, and approximately $5,000,000 for emergency work
to protect existing structures. The Works Progress Administration
provided labor and services. The relief activities of the American Red
Cross aggregated more than $7,500,000. The expenditures of the Federal Government and of the Red Cross for rehabilitation will add greatly

The idea of reservoir control on the tributaries of the
Mississippi is not new. The Ellet report ' to the War
Department in 1852 urged the making of surveys for the
installation of reservoirs on the Red River and other
tributaries which would serve the "double purpose" of
"keeping back the floods" and relieving "summer navigation from obstruction, by allowing the surplus so retained, to pass down in the season of low water." 5 The

is present here to a degree. It is true that "no part of
the [Red] river within Oklahoma is navigable." Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 591. Though appellant
alleged that the stream is not now a navigable river of
the United States, it has heretofore been authoritatively
determined that in years past "the usual head of navigation" was Lanesport, Arkansas, near the Oklahoma
boundary. Id., p. 589. At the present time, commerce
on the Red River is limited to the section below Alexandria, Louisiana, 122 miles above its mouth." The fact
that portions of a river are no longer used for commerce
does not dilute the power of Congress over them. Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, 256 U. S.113,
123; United States v. Appalachian Power Co., 311 U. S.
377, 409-410. And it is clear that Congress may exercise its control over the non-navigable stretches of a
river in order to preserve or promote commerce on the
navigable portions. United States v. Rio Grande Dam
& Irrigation Co., 174 U. S. 690, 703, 706, 708; United
States v. Utah, 283 U. S.64, 90. It is obvious that, at
least incidentally, Congress has done precisely that in
this case. Congress was not unmindful of the effect of
this project on the navigable capacity of the river. In
authorizing it, Congress exercised all the power it possessed to control navigable waters. The Acts in question contain a declaration that one of their purposes is
to improve navigation. And the Report clearly shows
that the Denison Reservoir will have at least an incidental effect in protecting or improving the navigability
of portions of the Red River.' The District Engineer
reported that "Inasmuch as any new navigation system
for the Red River would require flow regulation to furnish a dependable navigable improvement, the Denison

view, it would decrease bank caving and silt carriage,
substitute "moderately high stages of long durations for
high-flood stages of short duration," "furnish more dependable navigable stages especially. in the upper portions of the navigation pools," 29 and have a "favorable
effect on open-channel navigation by reducing flood
stages and increasing low-water flows." " The Division
Engineer expressed the view that a "dependable lowwater flow of 2,200 to 3,000 cubic feet per second which
would result from construction and operation of the

to the small commerce now developed upon those reaches
of the lower Red River which are included in approved
navigation projects, and might have a material bearing
upon future studies of the Red River with a view to its
further improvement. fn the present state of knowledge
upon this point, it is necessary to classify these benefits
among the intangibles. But there is no doubt that a
dependable low water supply would simplify, perhaps
materially, such future development of the river as may
be undertaken." "' Thus the effect on the river is tangible, though the value may be uncertain 82 since it de'Report,

is not our concern.
We would, however, be less than frank if we failed to
recognize this project as part of a comprehensive floodcontrot program for the Mississippi itself. But there is
no constitutional reason why Congress or the courts should
be blind to the engineering prospects of protecting the nation's arteries of commerce through control of the water,heds. There is no constitutional reason why Congress
caiihot, under the commerce power, treat the watersheds as
a key to flood control on navigable streams and their
tributaries. Nor is there a constitutional necessity for
viewing each reservoir project in isolation from a comprehensive plan covering the entire basin of a particular
river. We need no survey to know that the Mississippi is
a navigable river. We need no survey to know that the
tributaries are generous contributors to the floods bf the
Mississippi. And it is common knowledge that Mississippi floods have paralyzed commerce " in the affected
areas and have impaired navigation itself. We have recently recognized that "Flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through
utilization of power are . . . parts of commerce control."

United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, p. 426.
And we now add that the power of flood control extends
to the tributaries of navigable streams. For, just as control over the non-navigable parts of a river may be essential or desirable in the interests of the navigable portions,

so may the key to flood control on a navigable stream be
found in whole or in part in flood control on its tributaries.
As repeatedly recognized by this Court from M'Culloch v.
Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, to United States v. Darby, 312
U. S. 100, the exercise of the granted power of'Congress
to regulate interstate commerce may be aided by appropriate and needful control of activities and agencies which,
though intrastate, affect that commerce.
It is, of Course, true that the extent to which this project
will alleviate flood conditions in the lower Mississippi is
somewhat conjectural. The District Engineer estimated
that the Denison project would cause a reduction of 35,000 cubic feet per second in the lower Mississippi in case
the May, 1908, flood were repeated; 8,000 cubic feet per
second, in case of the May, 1935, flood; and 100,000 cubic
feet per second, in case of the estimated maximum probBut the Division Engineer pointed out that
able flood.'
"the magnitude of the effect would depend upon the size
and origin of thelconcurrent flood in Red River, and upon
the basis of reservoir operation." " In his view, a reduction in flow of 35,000 cubic feet per second in case of such
a flood as 1908 "if long enough sustained, would imply a
reduction in stage averaging 1.3 feet between Alexandria
and Moncla, and a reduction of 0.15 foot in the flow lines of
the Atchafalaya Basin and the main river below Old River,
provided they were at peak stage. At lower stages the
effect would be greater, but less necessary." 1O This matter was again reviewed in the Definite Project and the
following observations were made: " "Floods in the Missis"Report, p. 74. Cf. H. Doc. No. 798, 71st Cong., 3d Sess., Vol. 2,

sippi River usually occur in the spring as a result of flood
flows out of the Ohio River. The coincidence of flood
flows out of the Red River with the Mississippi River
spring floods is rare. However, the early summer floods
out of the Missouri River occasionally coincide in the
Mississippi River with the summer floods out of the Red
River. 'Lhe control provided by the proposed Denison
Dam and Reservoir on the Red River summer floods has
been estimated to produce a reduction of approximately
0.6 foot at the mouth of Old River on the Mississippi. This
reduction, while not substantial with respect to Mississippi flood stages, is important when flood crests seriously
tax the Mississippi levee system."
Such matters raise not constitutional issues but questions of policy. They relate to the wisdom, need, and
effectiveness of a particular project. They are therefore
questions for the Congress, not the courts. For us to inquire whether this reservoir will effect a substantial reduction in the lower Mississippi floods would be to exercise a
legislative judgment based on a complexity of engineering data. It is for Congress alone to decide whether a
particular project, by itself or as part of a more comprehensive scheme, will have such a beneficial effect on
the arteries of interstate commerce as to warrant it.
That determination is legislative in character. Cf.
United States v. Appalachian Power Co., supra, p. 424.
The nature of the judgment involved is re~mphasized if
this project is viewed not in isolation but as part of a comprehensive, integrated reservoir system in the Mississippi
River basin. A War Department survey in 1935 reveals
promising engineering prospects in a system of 157 reservoirs 8 throughout the tributaries of the Mississippi.

the Mississippi would be too conjectural would be to
deny the actual or potential aggregate benefits of the integrated system as a whole. That reveals the necessity,
from the constitutional viewpoint, of leaving to Congress
the decisioh as to what watersheds should be controlled
(and what methods should be employed) in order to
protect the various arteries of interstate commerce from
the disasters of floods.
Nor is it for us to determine whether the resulting
benefits to commerce as a result of this particular exercise by Congress of the commerce power outweigh the
costs of the undertaking. Arizona v. California, 283
U. S. 423, 456-457; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U. S. 288, 329-330. Nor may we inquire
into the motives of members of Congress who voted for
this project, in an endeavor to ascertain whether their
concern over the great national loss from soil erosion,
the enormous crop damages, the destruction of homes,
the loss of life and other like ravages of floods, overshadowed in their minds the desirability of protecting the
Mississippi and other arteries of commerce. Arizona v.
California,supra, p. 455, and cases cited. It is sufficient
for us that Congress has exercised its commerce power,
though other purposes will also be served. Id., p. 456.

a maximum height of 165 feet, while a reservoir for flood
control and power development would require a maximum height of 185 feet. It therefore earnestly contends
that the additional 20 feet in height of the dam requires
a very much greater acreage of appellant's domain than
would a project for flood control only. And it insists that
Congress is without authority to authorize a taking of
Oklahoma's domain for the construction of the water
power feature of the project.
There are several answers to these contentions. We
are not concerned here with the question as to the authority of the federal government to establish on a nonnavigable stream a power project which has no relation
to, or is not a part of, a flood-control project. While this
reservoir is a multiple-purpose project, it is basically one
for flood control. There is no indication that but for
flood control it would have been projected. It originated as part of a comprehensive program for flood control. And the recommendation in the Report that a
dual purpose dam be constructed was based "on the assumption that the flood-control project is to be built
in any event." "' See United States v. Chandler-Dunbar
Co., 229 U. S. 53, 73. Furthermore, it is plain from the
Report that the construction of the project so as to accommodate power will increase or augment some of the
flood-control benefits, including river flow, which would
accrue were the dam to be erected for flood control only.
Thus, the District Engineer stated: "If it were conat elevation 675, while the multiple-purpose dam would be at elevation 695. Report, p. 42. The Division Engineer, however, stated
that a restudy indicated "that in the case of the flood-control-only

project greater economy would result from narrowing the spillway to
1500 feet and raising the crest of the dam to elevation 681 feet."

structed solely for flood control it would have beneficial
effects in reducing floods, decreasing bank caving and silt
carriage, and in substituting moderately high stages of
long durations for high-flood stages of short duration.
If the Denison Reservoir were constructed for the dual
purposes of flood control and power development, these
beneficent effects would be augmented by those resulting
from the regulated power discharge which would increase
low-water flows and furnish more dependable navigable
stages especially in the upper portions of the navigation
pools." 42

It is true that the power phase of this project in purpose and effect will carry some of the costs of flood control.
The Division Engineer estimated that the annual deficit of
$287,000 from flood control would be offset by an annual
profit of $404,310 from power, leaving an annual net profit
of $117,000."' But the fact that Congress has introduced

"As stated in Report of the Mississippi Valley Committee of the Publie Works Administration (1934), p. 23:
"Navigation is particularly benefited by reduction of flood crests,
and all of the possibilities of water use are improved by increases in flow
at extreme low stages. Under certain favorable circumstances it
may be possible to release water from flood-control reservoirs to satisfy
requirements for hydroelectric power development at the dam, or to
regulate the flow down stream to the advantage of a variety of water
uses. In such cases equitable distribution of costs among the several
purposes served may even sufficiently reduce the costs chargeable to
flood protection to warrant the construction of flood-control reservoirs
which could not be justified for flood protection alone."

does not derogate from the authority of Congress to construct the dam for flood control, including river flow. The
power project is not unrelated to those purposes. 5 The
allocations of cost " and storage between power and flood
control, however significant for some purposes, cannot
conceal the flood-control realities of this total project.
Cost of the power project, roughly speaking, was determined by the cost of the multiple-purpose dam less the
cost of a dam for flood control only." On that basis the
Report points out that the cost of storage for flood control
only (5,800,000 acre-feet) is about $6.60 per acre-foot,
while the cost of the 3,500,000 acre-feet in the so-called
power pool is around $2 per acre-foot, exclusive of the cost
of the powerhouse and appurtenant construction. " In
this connection, the Definite Project states that the
"amount of storage which can be economically allocated
to the production of power depends on the ability of the
power market to absorb the power during the useful life of
the project." " But the Division Engineer observed that

"In actual operation of the dual-purpose project this cheap
storage would be dedicated to flood control, whereas in
the financial set-up it is credited to power.""' It is clear
from the Report " and the Definite Project, that the bottom pool of dead storage is designed to take care of the
deposit of silt "which would otherwise reduce the efficiency
and economic worth of the flood control storage." 52 At
the same time, it will effectively provide waterpower head.
And so far as the power storage is concerned, the Definite
Project makes plain that it is functionally related to the
broad objectives of flood control. The operation of the
reservoir will involve a consideration of its multiple purposes. 3 Its operation in periods of drought so as to

increase of the outflow, in case of impending floods from

Although this reservoir would approach economic justification if constructed exclusively for flood control, the income from power developed in conjunction with flood control would in part absorb this
deficiency since the value of the available power would be somewhat in
excess of its cost. It is apparent that the relative amounts of annual
return, flood benefits, or power revenues, from each of the two functions of a dual-purpose development are quantitively dependent upon
the manner in which storage potentialities of the site are apportioned
between these two functions. It is believed, however, that an increased
allocation of such storage to flood control at the expense of power

would not materially alter the above conclusion except perhaps to
show economic deficiencies for both phases of the development."

flood reaches the reservoir, thereby reducing the peak outflow of the reservoir to a minimum" 5-these are ample
evidence that the power features and the flood-control features of the dam, including river flow, are not unrelated.
They demonstrate that, in operation of the dam, the
several functions will be interdependent, and that the conflicts between the respective requirements of flood control
and power development are here more apparent than
real.'
They show that this is nonetheless a flood-control
project which will "fully control the maximum flood of
record," " though power, it is hoped, will pay the way.

"It was noted in Nat. Res. Com., Energy Resources & National
Policy (1939), p. 276, that:
"The most obvious and most discussed conflict of purpose in use of
water resources relates to flood control and power. Since flood control
is of great,urgency in so many basins, one may appear to demolish all
concept of wisdom in production of water power by the pat observation
that an empty reservoir will not run turbines and a full reservoir will
not catch floods. With respect to a particular reservoir, the observation is in point, but it is not thereby conclusive. That one reservoir
might be reserved for flood control and another on the same stream used
for power probably stumps no one. Neither should it stump anyone
that part of a single reservoir be reserved for flood and part be used
for power. Indeed, it would often cost less to provide flood-control
space in the same reservoir with power space than to build a separate
reservoir. And it should not be forgotten that storage to prevent the
ordinarily low flow of dry seasons is itself flood prevention in that
better sustained ordinary flow tends to maintain clear channels. If the
conflict really were irreconcilable, we should be forced to abolish private
water-power plants on every stream system requiring flood control.
If private power and public flood control may harmonize, one may
believe the same of public power and public flood control."
