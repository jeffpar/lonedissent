overhauled or inserted for the first time. Among the
latter was § 1 (17). See H. Rep. No. 1409, supra, p. 6.
But § 75 (r) also was left in the Act, and, as already indicated, its existence was not unknown to the revisors.
Its very presence in the statute after the revision is persuasive evidence that § 1 (17) was not intended to govern
proceedings under § 75.
We conclude that petitioner's activities must be tested
by the definition in § 75 (r) rather than by the one in
§ 1 (17). The judgment is reversed and the cause is
remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of other questions in light of our decision.

UNITED STATES v. ALABAMA.
No. 12, original. Argued April 28, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.
1. The law of Alabama fixes October 1st of each year as the tax day
as of which real property shall be assessed for the taxes of the
succeeding tax year, and provides a statutory process whereby, in
due course, valuations of properties and amounts of tax are determined. Taxes are made liens on the properties taxed, relating
back to the tax day and continuing until the taxes have been paid.
The lien is effective not only against the owner on the tax day but
also against subsequent purchasers. Held:
(1) That'the tax lien is not objectionable under the Federal Colstitution as applied to a purchaser who bought on or after the tax
day and before the amount of the tax had been fixed by levy and
assessment. P. 279.
(2) The fact that the purchaser, in such circumstances, was the
United States did not invalidate the lien. P. 281.
(3) Such a lien can not be enforced against the United States
without its consent. P. 281.
2. A proceeding against property in which the United States has an
interest is a suit against the United States. P. 282.

UNITED STATES v. ALABAMA.

Argument for the United States.

THIs was a suit brought in this Court by the United
States against the State of Alabama in which the plaintiff
sought to have removed, as clouds on its title, tax liens
imposed under the law of the State upon lands purchased
by the plaintiff. -The Court decrees that tax sales and certificates of purchase, resulting from proceedings in an Alabama county

court for enforcement of the liens, shall be set aside, but
in other respects the bill is dismissed.
Assistant Attorney General Littell, with whom Attorney General Jackson and Solicitor General Biddle were
on the brief, for the United States.
The lands were acquired before the time when, by
completion of levy and assessment, the amounts of state
taxes had been ascertained. They are therefore not subject to liens for the taxes.
Two things are requisite for the ascertainment of an
ad valorem tax: The tax rate must be fixed and the property must be valued. On October 1, 1936, only the state
tax rate was fixed. The lands had not been valued and
the county and school tax rates had not been fixed. And
when the three tracts were acquired by the United States,
the taxes were still unascertained. If the assessments
had not been thereafter determined and the additional
levies made, the taxes would never have been imposed.
See Bannon v. Burnes, 39 F. 892, 898; Portland v.
Multnomah County, 135 Ore. 469, 473.
The ascertainment of the taxes after acquisition of the
lands by the United States, could not impose any liability upon the lands. The State could still levy and
assess for the purpose of imposing a personal liability
on the former owners. But the property of the United
States is not subject to state taxation. Van Brocklin v.

United States, 290 U. S. S9, 94-95.
The Alabama lien statute did not per se make the lands
liable for taxes. It neither fixes rates of taxation nor
enumerates subjects of taxation. It does not impose
taxes but secures their p4yment. Unless taxes are imposed, § 372 accomplishes nothing. Cf., Heine v. Levee
Commissioners, 19 Wall. 655, 659. In re Opinions of the
Justices, 234 Ala. 358. The declaration that the lien
attaches as of October 1, when the procedure of imposing
the tax commences, does not do away with the necessity
of completing that procedure. Nor will it cure any defect of procedure. See Gaston v. ReconstructionFinance
Corporation,237 Ala. 111, 112; Lewis v. Burch, 215 Ala.
20, 21; Laney "v. Proctor,236 Ala. 318, 320.
The statutory declaration of a lien for taxes imposes
no liability upon property conveyed to the United States
before, by completion of levy and assessment, the taxes
have been ascertained. Bannon v. Burnes, 39 F. 892,
897, 898; United States v. Pierce County, 193 F. 529, 532533; Territory v. Perrin, 9 Ariz. 316, 320; see, also,

Nor does a declaration of lien like that of the Alabama
statute impose liability upon property when, before ascertainment of taxes, the power to tax is lost by reason
of acquisition of the property by a State or one of its
political subdivisions, State v. Snohomish County, 71

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The United States brought this suit to quiet its title
to land in Macon County, Alabama. The complaint alleges that the State of Alabama is asserting liens as attaching to the land on October 1, 1936, for state and
county taxes for the tax year 1937; and further that the
State claims an interest in the land by reason of tax
sales and the issue to the State of certificates of purchase. The Government asks a decree declaring the
liens, tax sales and certificates of purchase to be invalid
and enjoining the State from asserting its claims. The
case was heard on bill and answer.
There are three tracts involved, which were conveyed
by the owners to the United States on October 1, 1936,
December 10, 1936, and March 10, 1937, respectively.
The applicable statute of Alabama' provides that
"From and after the first day of October of each year,
1 Section

372, Act No. 194, General Acts Alabama, 1935, p. 566, is

as follows:
"From and after the first day of October of each year, when property becomes assessable the State shall have a lien upon each and

when property becomes assessable the State shall have
a lien upon each. and every piece or parcel of property
owned by any taxpayer for the payment of all taxes
which may be assessed against him . . . which lien shall
continue until such taxes are paid." The county is to
have a like lien for taxes assessed by it. These liens
are made superior to all other liens and may be enforced
by sale as provided in the Act.
Under the statute, the process of assessment for the tax
year 1937 began on October 1, 1936. The grantors in the
above mentioned conveyances, as the respective owners
on that date, made their returns and in due course the
tax assessor listed and valued the several tracts.' His
every piece or parcel of property owned by any taxpayer for the
payment of all taxes which may be assessed against him and upon
each piece and parcel of property real or personal assessed to owner
unknown which lien shall continue until such taxes are paid, and
the county shall have a like lien thereon for the payment of the
taxes which may be assessed by it; and if such property is within
the limits of a municipal corporation such municipal corporation
shall have a like lien thereon for the payment of the taxes which
may be assessea by it These liens shall be superior to all other
liens and shall exist in the order named and each of such liens may be
enforced and foreclosed by sale for taxes as provided in this Act,
or as other liens upon property are enforced."
The State also cites § 8874 of Article 6, Chapter 314, of the Code
of Alabama, 1923, which provides:
"From and after the first day of October of each year, the state
shall have a prior lien upon each and every piece or parcel of property, real or personal, for the payment of any and all taxes which
may be assessed against the owner, or upon such property, during that
year, for the use of the state; and the county shall have a like lien
thereon for the payment of the taxes which may be assessed against
such owner, or upon such property, during that year, for the use'
of the county; and these liens shall exist as to all iands bid in by
the state at tax sales for the annual taxes thereafter assessed on
the value of the property so purchased, in the event of the tax title
failing."

Opinion of the Court.

valuations were certified as provided by the statute to
the county board of review, which by virtue of its authority to fix valuations, made the definitive assessments.'
It appears that the board of review met on March 8,
1937, and adjourned on March 20, 1937. It also appears
thaf the rate for state taxes had been fixed by the statute,' and the rate for county taxes was set on February
8, 1937, under the authority given to the court of county
commissioners.5 The school district tax was approved
by the electors of the school district at an election held
on June 14, 1937. The taxes for the year 1937 became
payable on October 1, 1937, and became delinquent on
January 1, 1938.' Proceedings were then instituted in
the county court for the sale of the lands, and under its
decrees the sales took place on June 12, 1939. The
lands were sold to the State and certificates of purchase
were issued accordingly.
First. The Government, invoking the. principle that
lands owned by the United States cannot be taxed by a
State (Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U. S. 151), contends
that the asserted liens are without validity because at
the time the tracts were acquired by the United States
the amount of the taxes had not been ascertained, as the
values had not then been assessed and the rates of taxation had not been fixed. Therefore it is said that the taxes
had not then been imposed. The argument is that the
Alabama tax statute does not "impose taxes" but "secures
their payment" and that unless taxes are imposed the
statute has no effect. The lien, it is urged, becomes
"fixed and final" only when the taxes have been ascertained "by completion of levy and assessment."
There is no question however, as the Government concedes, that the state statute purports to impose a lien as

of October 1, 1936, for the taxes which by the process of
assessment were to become payable for the tax year 1937.
October first is fixed as the tax day, and as of that day
owners are to make their returns, values are to be fixed
and the taxes laid. There is no question that the State
thus undertakes to create an inchoate lien upon the lands
as of the tax day, a lien which is to be effective for the
amount of the taxes for the ensuing year as these are
fixed by the defined statutory method. This lien by the
state law is made effective not only as against the owners
on the tax day but also as against subsequent mortgagees
and purchasers. "It follows the land in the hands of
the vendee, all persons being chargeable with a knowledge
of its existence." Driggersv. Cassaday, 71 Ala. 529, 534.
See, also, Swann v. State, 77 Ala. 545; State v. Alabama
Educational Foundation, 231 Ala. 11, 16; 163 So. 527.
We find nothing in the Federal Constitution which invalidates such a statutory scheme. Subsequent lienors and
purchasers have due notice of the tax liability imposed as
of the tax day and of the process of assessment, and that
liability, when its amount is definitely ascertained, relates
back to the day specified. We recognized the validity
of such a provision in New York v. Maclay, 288 U. S. 290,
292, where we observed that a tax lien created in a similar
manner under a statute of New York "is effective for
many purposes though its amount is undetermined. It
is notice to mortgagees or purchasers, who are held to
loan or purchase at their own risk if they take their mortgages or deeds before the tax has been assessed or paid."
The precise decision in that case allowing priority to
the United States under R. S. 3466 for debts due by an
insolvent corporation over claims of the State for franchise taxes due but not assessed or liquidated until after
a receivership, in no way detracted from the recognition
of the effectiveness of the state law creating a lien as
against mortgagees and purchasers. As the court said,

UNITED STATES v. ALABAMA.
274

Opinion of the Court.

"Against mortgagees and purchasers a lien perfected afterwards may take effect by relation as of the date of
the inchoate lien through which mortgagees and pur-

chasers become chargeable with notice." Id., p. 293. See
also, Osterberg v. Union Trust Co., 93 U. S. 424, 425, 428;
People v. Commissioners, 104 U. S. 466, 468. Compare
Shotwell v. Moore, 129 U. S. 590, 598. The lien in such
a case, though inchoate on the day specified, and maturing
when the extent of liability is ascertained by the statutory process, is similar in that respect, as the court said
in the Maclay case, to the lien of a transfer tax or duty
upon the estate of a decedent which is effective although
the amount is ascertained after death.
Our present inquiry is whether, assuming the validity
of the state statute creating a lien as of October 1, 1936,
as against other subsequent purchasers, it should be
deemed invalid as against the United States. The question is not whether such a lien could be enforced against
the United States. The fact that the United States had
taken title and that proceedings could not be taken
against the United States without its consent would protect it against such enforcement. But that immunity
would not be predicated upon the invalidity of the lien.
If in this instance title had been taken by the United
States in the summer of 1937 after the amount of the
taxes had been ascertained and the respective liens were
concededly valid, still proceedings against the United
States could not be prosecuted without its consent.
The Government is not content with that measure of
protection. The Government brings this suit in the view
that it is entitled to have a marketable title and it seeks
to remove the liens in question as clouds upon that title
which would interfere with the disposition of the lands
in the future. From that standpoint the Government
asks a decree declaring the invalidity of the liens and
enjoining the State from asserting any claim in the lands

either adverse to the United States or to its successors in
title. We think that the United States is not entitled
Vo that relief. The United States took the conveyances
with knowledge of the state law fixing the lien as of October 1st. That law in dreating such liens for the taxes
subsequently assessed in due course and making them
effective as against subsequent purchasers did not contravene the Constitution of the United States and we perceive no reason why the United States, albeit protected
with respect to proceedings against it without its consent,
should stand, so far as the existence of the liens is concerned, in any different position from that of other purchasers of lands in Alabama who take conveyances on and
after the specified tax dateJ It is familiar practice for
grantees who take title in such circumstances to see that
provision is made for the payment of taxes and the Government could easily have protected itself in like manner.
Finding no constitutional infirmity in the state legislation, we think that the liens should be held valid.
We make no exception of the tract conveyed to the
United States on the tax day, October 1, 1936, as we think
the state statute, as contended by the State, is to be
deemed effective from the moment the tax day began.
See Beck v. Johnson, 235 Ala. 323, 324; 179 So. 225.
Second. With respect to the tax sales the case has a
different aspect. The proceedings in the county court
for the sale of the lands were taken and the decrees were
rendered after the United States had become the owner
of the tracts. A proceeding against property in which
the United States has ani interest is a suit against the
United States. The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 154. The United
States was an indispensable party to proceedings for the
sale of the lands, and in the absence of its consent to the
prosecution of such proceedings, the county court was
without jurisdiction and its decrees, the tax sales and the
certificates of purchase issued to the State were void.

pleading to the contrary in its answer, the invalidity
of the tax sales is now conceded by the State.
The United States is entitled to a decree setting aside
the tax sales and the certificates of purchase, and in other

respects the complaint is dismissed.
It is so ordered.

CITY OF NEW YORK v. FEIRING, TRUSTEE IN
BANKRUPTCY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 863. Argued May 7, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.
1. The question whether an obligation to a State is a tax entitled to
priority under § 64 of the Bankruptcy Act is a federal question.

P. 285.
2. The Bankruptcy Act is of nationwide application and § 64' thereof
is not to be construed or varied by the particular characterization by
local law of the state's demand. P. 285.
Provisions of the state law creating the obligation and decisions
of the state courts interpreting them are resorted to not to learn
whether they have denominated the obligation a "tax" but to ascertain whether its incidents are such as to constitute a tax within
the meaning of § 64.
3. The tax imposed by the New York City Sales Tax Law is a tax
on the seller within the meaning of § 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, as
well as on the buyer, since both are made liable for payment in
invitum and subject to distraint of their property for its collection.
P. 287.
It is not any the less a tax laid on the seller because the statute
places a like burden in the alternative on the purchaser or because
it affords to the seller facilities of which he did not avail himself to
pass the tax on to the buyer.
