SAMPSELL 'v. IMPERIAL PAPER CORP. 215
Opinion of the Court.

SAMPSELL, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY, v. IMPERIAL PAPER & COLOR CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 601.

Argued March 31, 1941.-Decided April 28, 1941.

1. A court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction, by summary proceedings,
to cover into the estate of the bankrupt, property of a corporation, the only stockholders and officers of which were the bankrupt, his wife and son, and to which the bankrupt had made a
transfer, not in good faith, of his property; and an order to that
effect, entered after notice to the corporation and its stockholders,
is binding on the corporation, and may not be collaterally attacked
in proceedings wherein a creditor of the corporation sought priority against its assets. P. 218.
2. In such case, an unsecured creditor of the corporation, who had
some knowledge of the fraudulent character of the transfer by
the bankrupt to the corporation, held entitled only to pari passu
participation with individual creditors of the bankrupt. P. 219.
114 F. 2d 49, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 312 U. S. 669, to review a judgment reversing an order denying priority to a claim in bankruptcy.

Mr. Thomas S. Tobin for petitioner.
Mr. Hiram E. Casey for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
One Downey was adjudged a voluntary bankrupt in
November, 1938. Prior to June, 1936, Downey had been
engaged in business, unincorporated, and had incurred a
debt to the predecessor of Standard Coated Products
Corporation of approximately $104,000. In that month
he formed a corporation, Downey Wallpaper & Paint
Co., under the laws of California. Downey, his wife and
his son were the sole stockholders, directors and officers.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

Downey's stock of goods was transferred to the corporation' on credit, which was extended from time to time.
He leased space in the store building occupied by him to
the corporation, which continued business at the old
stand. Except for qualifying shares,2 neither he nor the
other members of his family paid cash for the stock
which was issued to them' but received most of those
shares a few months prior to bankruptcy in satisfaction
of the balance of the obligation owed to him by the corporation.' Respondent extended credit to the corporation. At the time of Downey's bankruptcy respondent's
claim amounted to about $5,400 and was unsecured.
On petition of the trustee in bankruptcy, the referee
issued an order to show cause directed to the corporation, Downey, his wife and son why the assets of the
corporation should not be marshalled for the benefit of
the creditors of the bankrupt estate and administered by
the trustee.' Downey answered. There was a hearing.
The referee found, inter alia, that the transfer of the
property to the corporation was not in good faith but
was made for the purpose of placing the property beyond
the reach of Downey's creditors and of retaining for
"A notice of the intended sale was recorded under the California
Bulk Sales Law. Civil Code, § 3440.
The shares had a par value of $100. Downey apparently paid
$500 in cash for the qualifying shares.
SThere were 99 shares issued. On July 1, 1938, Downey caused
49 shares to be transferred to his wife and 25 shares to his son.
Those transfers, according to the referee, were "entirely without
consideration" to Downey.
'There is some dispute as to the amount of this obligation. Petitioner insists, and the findings of the referee lend some support to
his view, that the stock of goods was transferred to the corporation
at the inventory price-about $14,000. The court below said that
it was transferred at $7,500. The corporation apparently had paid
$5,000 on that obligation.
Shortly after the adjudication the receiver, pursuant to a stipulation, took possession of the property of the corporation.

SAMPSELL v. IMPERIAL PAPER CORP. 217
215

Opinion of the Court.

Downey and his family all of the beneficial interest
therein; that the stock was issued in satisfaction of
Downey's claim against the corporation, when Downey
was hopelessly insolvent, to prevent Downey's creditors
from reaching the assets so transferred; that the corporation was "nothing but a sham and a cloak" devised by
Downey "for the purpose of preserving and conserving
his assets" for the benefit of himself and his family; and
that the corporation was formed for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding his creditors. The referee accordingly ordered that the property of the corporation was property of the bankrupt estate and that
it be adminstered for the benefit of the creditors of the
estate. That order was entered on April 7, 1939. No
appeal from that order was taken.
Respondent, who was not a party to that proceeding,
later filed its claim stating that as a creditor of the corporation it had a prior right to distribution of the funds
in the hands of the trustee received from the liquidation
of the assets of the corporation. It secured an order to
show cause why the trustee should not so apply such
funds. The trustee, objected to the allowance of the
claim as a prior claim and contended that it should be
allowed only as a general unsecured claim. There was a
hearing. The referee found that respondent, with knowledge of Downey's indebtedness, was instrumental in getting him to form the corporation and had full knowledge
of its fraudulent character. He disallowed respondent's
claim as a prior claim but allowed it as a general unsecured claim. That order was confirmed. On appeal, the
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's claim should be accorded priority against the funds
realized from the liquidation of the corporation's property. 114 F. 2d 49. We granted the petition for certiorari because of the importance in administration of
the Bankruptcy Act of the questions raised.

OCTOBER TERM, 1940.
Opinion of the Court.

313 U. S.

We think the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error.
1. The order entered in the summary proceedings
against Downey, his wife, his son and his family corporation was a final order binding as between the parties.
There can be no question but that the jurisdiction of
the bankruptcy court was properly exercised by summary proceedings. The circumstances are many and
varied where an affiliated corporation does not have, as
against the trustee of the dominant stockholder, the
status of a substantial adverse claimant within the rule
of Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox, 264 U. S. 426.
The legal existence of the affiliated corporation does not
per se give it standing to insist on a plenary suit. In re
Muncie Pulp Co., 139 F. 546; W. A. Liller Bldg. Co. v.
Reynolds, 247 F. 90; In re Rieger, Kapner & Altmark,
157 F. 609; In re Eilers Music House, 270 F. 915; Central
Republic Bank & Trust Co. v. Caldwell, 58 F. 2d 721;
Commerce Trust Co. v. Woodbury, 77 F. 2d 478; Fish v.
East, 114 F. 2d 177. Mere legal paraphernalia will not
suffice to transform into a substantial adverse claimant
a corporation whose affairs are so closely assimilated to
the affairs of the dominant stockholder that in substance
it is little more than his corporate pocket. Whatever
the full reach of that rule may be, it is clear that a
family corporation's adverse claim is merely colorable
where, as in this case, the corporation is formed in order
to continue the bankrupt's business, where the bankrupt
remains in control, and where the effect of the transfer
is to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors. In re Schoenberg, 70 F. 2d 321; In re Berkowitz, 173 F. 1013. And
see Glenn, Liquidation, § § 30-32. Cf. Shapiro v.
Wilgus, 287 U. S. 348. Hence, Downey's corporation
was in no position to assert against Downey's trustee
that it was so separate and insulated from Downey's
other business affairs as to stand in an independent and
adverse position. Furthermore, there was ,no appeal

Opinion of the Court.

from the order entered in the summary proceedings. It
therefore could not be collaterally attacked in the proceedings by which respondent sought priority for its
claim.
2. That conclusion, of course, does not mean that the
order consolidating the estates did, or in the absence of
the respondent as a party could, determine what priority,
if any, it had to the corporate assets. In re Foley, 4 F.
2d 154. All questions of fraudulent conveyance aside,
creditors of the corporation normally would be entitled
to satisfy their claims out of corporate assets prior to
any participation by the creditors of the stockholder.
In re Smith, 36 F. 2d 697. Such priority, however, would
be denied if the corporation's creditors were parties to
a fraudulent transfer of the stockholder's assets to, the
corporation. Furthermore, where the transfer was
fraudulent or where the relationship between the stockholder and the corporation was such as to justify the
use of summary proceedings to absorb the corporate
assets into the bankruptcy estate of the stockholder, the
corporation's unsecured creditors would have the burden
of showing that their equity was paramount in order to
obtain priority as respects the corporate assets. Cf. New
York Trust Co. v. Island Oil & Transport Corp., 56 F.
2d 580. The power of the bankruptcy court to subordinate claims or to adjudicate equities arising out of the
relationship between the several creditors is complete.
Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., 306 U. S. 307;
Pepper v. Litton, 308 U. S. 295; Bird & Sons Sales Corp.
v. Tobin, 78 F. 2d 371. But the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is equality of distribution. § 65-a; Moore v.
Bay, 284 U. S. 4. To bring himself outside of that
rule an unsecured creditor carries a burden of showing
by clear and convincing evidence that its application to
his case so as to deny him priority would work an injustice. Such burden has been sustained by creditors
of the affiliated corporation and their paramount equity

has been established where there was no fraud in the
transfer, where the transferor remained solvent, and
where the creditors had extended credit to the transferee.
Commerce Trust Co. v. Woodbury, supra.
But in this case there was a fraudulent transfer. The
saving clause in 13 Eliz. which protected innocent purchasers for value 6 was not broad enough to protect mere
unsecured creditors of the fraudulent transferee. Clark's
Administratorv. Rucker, 7 B. Mon. (Ky.) 583; Mullanphy
Savings Bank v. Lyle, 75 Tenn. 431; Powell v. Ivey, 88
N. C. 256; Lockren v. Rustan, 9 N. D. 43, 45; 81 N. W. 60.
To be sure, creditors of a fraudulent transferee have at
times been accorded priority over the creditors of the transferor where they have "taken the property into their own
custody." 1 Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences (1940) § 238.

Cf. O'Gasapian v. Danielson, 284

Mass. 27; 187 N. E. 107. The same result obtains in case
of bona fide lien creditors of the fraudulent transferee.
W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Groseclose, 174 Okl. 193; 49 P. 2d
1085; Plauche v. StreaterInvestment Corp., 189 La. 785;
180 So. 637. Cf. Haskell v. Phelps, 191 Wash. 567; 71 P.
2d 550. And estoppel or other equitable considerations
might well result in the award of priority even to unsecured creditors of the transferee, the conveyance being
good between the parties.7 Cf. Kennedy v. GeorgiaState
'See Clements v. Moore, 6 Wall. 299; Harrell v. Beall, 17 Wall.
590. That the same result follows in absence of the saving clause,
see Astor v. Wells, 4 Wheat. 466, interpreting L. Ohio, 1809-10, ch.
LVII, § 2. And see 1 Glenn, Fraudulent Conveyances and Preferences (1940) § 237.
'All question of the rights of creditors of the grantor aside,
creditors of the transferee have at times been allowed to reach the
property after its reconveyance to the grantor. Chapin v. Pease,
10 Conn. 69; Budd v. Atkinson, 30 N. J. Eq. 530; Hegstad v.
Wysiecki, 178 App. Div. 733; 165 N. Y. S. 898. But see Farmers'
Bank v. Gould, 48 W. Va. 99; 35 S. E. 878; Westervelt v. Hagge,
61 Neb. 647; 85 N. W. 852; Bicocchi v. Casey-Swasey Co., 91 Tex.

Syllabus.

Bank, 8 How. 586, 613. Yet none of these considerations
is applicable here. The facts do not justify the invocation of estoppel against Downey's individual creditors.
Respondent is neither a lien creditor nor an innocent
grantee for value. At best it is in no more favorable
position than a judgment creditor who has not levied
execution. Furthermore, respondent had at least some
knowledge as to the fraudulent character of Downey's
corporation. Cf. Goodwin v. Hammond, .13 Cal. 168;
Bull v. Ford, 66 Cal. 176; 4 P. 1175. And title to the
property fraudulently conveyed has vested in the bankruptcy trustee of the grantor. We have not been referred
to any state law or any equitable considerations which
under these circumstances would accord respondent the
priority which it seeks. It therefore is entitled only to
pari passu participation with Downey's individual creditors. Buffum v. Barceloux Co., 289 U. S. 227.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.
Reversed.

OF NEW YORK.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK.

No. 740. Argued April 3, 4, 1941.-Decided April 28, 1941.

1. A state statute (N. Y. Laws, 1938, c. 510, amending § 1083 Civil
Prac. Act), directing that the amount of a deficiency judgment
after foreclosure sale of mortgaged property shall be ascertained
by deducting from the amount of the debt the fair and reasonable market value of the property (to be determined by the court
upon affidavits or otherwise) or the sale price of the property,
whichever is higher, is not invalid under the Contract Clause of
the Federal Constitution as applied to the case of a mortgagee who
bought in the property at the foreclosure sale for much less than
the debt, and who, under the law as it existed when the mortgage
was made, would have been entitled to a deficiency judgment for
