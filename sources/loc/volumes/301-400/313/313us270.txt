CARLOTA BENITEZ SAMPAYO v. BANK OF NOVA
SCOTIA.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST
CIRCUIT.

No. 90.

Submitted April 10, 1941.-Decided May 12, 1941.

The status of "farmer" for the purposes of proceedings under § 75 of
the Bankruptcy Act, is determined by the definition of that term
in § 75 (r); not by the definition in § 1 (17), which relates to other
sections. Pp. 271, 274.
This results not only from the language of § 75 (r) but also from
the legislative history.
109 F. 2d 743, 750, reversed.
CERTIORARI,

311 U. S. 623, to review the affirmance of an

order of the District Court which dismissed a proceeding
under § 75 of the Bankruptcy Act on the ground that the
petitioner was not a "farmer."
Messrs. Fernando B. Fornarisand Elmer McClain submitted for petitioner.
Messrs. Walter L. Newsom, Jr.and J. HenriBrown submitted for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE MURPHY

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
To arrange a composition or an extension as a fhrmerdebtor, petitioner filed a petition in October, 1938, under
§ 75 of the Bankruptcy Act (47 Stat. 1467, 1470; as
amended 48 Stat. 925; Id., 1289; 49 Stat. 246; Id., 942).
Failing to secure the assents required by § 75 (g), petitioner amended her petition in November, 1938, to proceed under § 75 (s). Respondent then moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioner was not
a "farmer" and therefore was not entitled to the relief

afforded by § 75 (s). After a hearing, the District Court
sustained the motion.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that
the formula for determining whether petitioner was a
farmer was to be found in § 1 (17) of the Chandler Act
of 1938 (52 Stat. 840, 841), and that petitioner could not
be regarded as a farmer within its terms. 109 F. 2d 743,
on rehearing, 109 F. 2d 750. Because the decision was
substantially inconsistent with Order 50 (9) of the General Orders in Bankruptcy (305 U. S. 677, 710), we granted
certiorari.' 311 U. S.623.
The ultimate question, of course, is whether petitioner
may proceed under § 75 (s) as a farmer-debtor, but for
present purposes the problem is to select the definition of
"farmer" which is applicable to persons petitioning for
relief under §75.
The Bankruptcy Act contains two definitions of the
term "farmer." Section 1 (17) of the Chandler revision provides: "'Farmer' shall mean an individual personally engaged in farming or tillage of the soil, and shall
include an individual personally engaged in dairy farming or in the productions of poultry, livestock, or poultry or livestock products in their unmanufactured state,
if the principal part of his income is derived from any
one or more of such operations."
Section 75 (r), as amended in 1935 (49 Stat. 246)
provides: "For the purposes of this section, section 4 (b),
and section 74, the term 'farmer' includes not only an
individual who is primarily bona fide personally engaged
in producing products of the soil, but also any individual
who is primarily bona fide personally engaged in dairy
farming, the production of poultry or livestock, or the
'Insofar as material here, Order 50 (9) reads: ". . The petition
shall show to the satisfaction of the district court that the decedent
at the time of his death was a farmer within the meaning of subdivision (r) of section 75 ... "

production of poultry products or livestock products in
their unmanufactured state, or the principal part of
whose income is derived from any one or more of the
foregoing operations, and includes the personal representative of a deceased farmer. .. "
Starting with the premise that only one of the definitions can stand, respondent contends that § 1 (17) is an
implicit repeal of § 75 (r). To support the contention,
respondent points to the obsolete reference in § 75 (r)
to § 74, and to a statement in a committee report which
is said to indicate that Congress intended the definition
in § 1 (17) to measure the applicability of § 4 (b) to
persons who claim to be farmers.'
The argument ignores the plain import of § 75 (r).
The meaning of the phrase "for the purposes of this section" is hardly open to question. Obviously, it is neither
impossible nor necessarily inconsistent to prescribe one
definition for a particular section or sections and another
for the balance of the Act. Nor is the applicability of
§ 75 (r) to proceedings under § 75 seriously placed in
doubt because the former section refers to a section which
no longer exists under that number and to a section
which now may be governed by § 1 (17). The only question here is whether § 75 (r) or § 1 (17) is applicable
to § 75.
Section 75, with immaterial differences, first appeared
in the distressed-debtor legislation of 1933. 47 Stat.
'The latter argument, upon which we express no opinion, is
grounded on the statement in H. Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st
Sess., p. 6, which runs: "The amendment of May 5 (sic), 1935
... extends the meaning of the term 'farmer.' . . . Correspondingly, section 4 of the act is amended by substituting the phrase
'a farmer' for the language 'a person engaged chiefly in farming or
the tillage of the soil.' Pursuant to this purpose of Congress to
expand the meaning of the term, it would seem advisable to formulate a new definition and to include it in section 1 as clause (17)."

Opinion of the Court.

1467, 1470-1473. Designed for a particular purpose, the
relief of hard-pressed farmers, it was regarded as a special and temporary enactment. See § 75 (c); compare
S. Rep. No. 1215, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3; H. Rep.
No. 1898, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2. In 1938 its time limit
was extended to 1940. 52 Stat. 84, 85. At that time a
special committee held extensive hearings on a proposal
to make § 75 a permanent part of theBankruptcy Act,
and finally concluded that the section should be continued
only as temporary legislation. Hearings before Special
Subcommittee on Bankruptcy of the Committee on the
Judiciary, 75th Congress, 2d and 3d Sessions; see also H.
Rep. No. 1833, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2; S. Rep. No.
899, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. Rep. No. 1658, 76th Cong.,
3d Sess., p. 2. Naturally enough, legislation drafted for
such a purpose carried its own test for determining the
persons to whom it should apply.
When the proposed revision of 1938 was before a Senate Committee, Representative Chandler, the proponent
of the bill, stated: "We did not touch [§ 75] and it is not
affected by this Act." Discussing the alterations in existing statutes worked by the new act, the House Report
laconically observed that there was "no change" in § 75.
H. Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 144. Somewhat less briefly, the Senate Report stated: "Section 75
relates to agricultural compositions and extensions.
These expire by limitation and are, therefore, not covered by the bill." S. Rep. No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.,
p. 18.
The Chandler Act, a careful and comprehensive revision of bankruptcy legislation, was the product of several years of thoughtful study. See 81 Cong. Rec. 86468649. One of its avowed purposes was to clarify or remove inconsistent and overlapping provisions. See H.
Rep. No. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-3. As a part
of this comprehensive revision, numerous definitions were

overhauled or inserted for the first time. Among the
latter was § 1 (17). See H. Rep. No. 1409, supra, p. 6.
But § 75 (r) also was left in the Act, and, as already indicated, its existence was not unknown to the revisors.
Its very presence in the statute after the revision is persuasive evidence that § 1 (17) was not intended to govern
proceedings under § 75.
We conclude that petitioner's activities must be tested
by the definition in § 75 (r) rather than by the one in
§ 1 (17). The judgment is reversed and the cause is
remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration of other questions in light of our decision.
Reversed.

UNITED STATES v. ALABAMA.
No. 12, original. Argued April 28, 1941.-Decided May 26, 1941.
1. The law of Alabama fixes October 1st of each year as the tax day
as of which real property shall be assessed for the taxes of the
succeeding tax year, and provides a statutory process whereby, in
due course, valuations of properties and amounts of tax are determined. Taxes are made liens on the properties taxed, relating
back to the tax day and continuing until the taxes have been paid.
The lien is effective not only against the owner on the tax day but
also against subsequent purchasers. Held:
(1) That'the tax lien is not objectionable under the Federal Colstitution as applied to a purchaser who bought on or after the tax
day and before the amount of the tax had been fixed by levy and
assessment. P. 279.
(2) The fact that the purchaser, in such circumstances, was the
United States did not invalidate the lien. P. 281.
(3) Such a lien can not be enforced against the United States
without its consent. P. 281.
2. A proceeding against property in which the United States has an
interest is a suit against the United States. P. 282.
