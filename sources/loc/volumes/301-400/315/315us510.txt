rehearing before the Supreme Court of California relied on
that part of the stipulation in urging that the cause be remanded for a further hearing since that Court concluded
that "appellant has not furnished any explanation of why
its California business differs so from the average that the
formula produced an erroneous result." The petition for
rehearing was denied. Appellant now asserts that it has
been denied procedural due process under the rule of
Saunders v. Shaw, 244 U. S. 317. We do not agree. The
Supreme Court of California created no innovation and
sprung no surprise when it placed on appellant the burden
of establishing that the formula taxed extraterritorial
values. As we have noted, that is settldd doctrine. Appellant had a full opportunity to be heard on the issues which
it tendered.

employer is required to collect the tax laid on the wage incomes of
his employees, but is liable for its payment whether or not he collects
it. P. 515.
2. This liability of the employer is a tax, and a claim thereon is entitled to priority as for a tax under § 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy
Act. P. 515.
3. A tax for the purposes of § 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act includes any pecuniary burden upon individuals or property for the

Opinion of the Court.

4. The provision of § 902 of Title IX of the Social Security Act allowing the employer to credit against his tax, under § 901, the
amount of his contributions to state unemployment funds up to
90% of the tax, does not make the tax to that extent a penalty,
within the meaning of § 57 (j) of the Bankruptcy Act, as applied
to an employer who has failed to make such contributions. P. 516.
5. In determining the amounts distributable to the United States on its
tax claim and to the State for its unemployment fund, under §§ 901
and 902 of Title IX of the Social Security Act, from a bankrupt
estate whose assets were insufficient to satisfy these and other claims
of priority, held that the allowance to be made for the state fund
should be credited against the total tax claim of the United States
under § 901, rather than against the amount actually available for
such claim. P. 520.

This amount was insufficient even to meet those claims
of the federal and state governments which were assertedly
entitled to priority as taxes under § 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act.1 The federal claims of this character were
for amounts due under § § 801 and 802 of Title VIII and
under § 901 of Title IX of the Social Security Act,2 and for
certain taxes as to which no question is raised in this case.
The state claims were for payments due its unemployment insurance fund, and for taxes not in issue here.
The state's appeal from the District Court's first order
of distribution was discontinued by agreement of the
'"Section 64. Debts which have priority.-a. The debts to have
priority, in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and to
be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment,

parties because the Social Security Act had been extensively amended while the appeal was pending.8 A second
order was thereupon entered by the District Court. The
State again appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. It
contended that the share of the assets granted to the federal government was excessive for three reasons: (1) the
claim based on § 801 of Title VIII of the Social Security
Act was a claim for a debt rather than for taxes and thus
was not entitled to priority under § 64 (a) (4) of the
Bankruptcy Act; (2) no more than 10% of the claim
based on § 901 of Title IX of the Social Security Act was
entitled to allowance because the balance constituted a
claim for a penalty rather than a tax and thus fell within
the prohibition of § 57 (j) of the Bankruptcy Act;' and
(3) the credit against the Title IX claim provided for
in § 902 was incorrectly calculated. The Circuit Court
of Appeals sustained the state's contention with respect
to the Title VIII claim and reversed to that extent the
order of the District Court, but rejected the state's arguments with respect to the claim under Title IX.
First. The claim based on Title VIII. Section 801
bears the heading "Income tax on employees" and provides for a tax "upon the income of every individual"
equal to 1 per centum of the wages received by him with
respect to employment during 1937. Section 802 (a)
provides that this tax "shall be collected by the employer
of the taxpayer, by deducting the amount of the tax from
the wages as and when paid." The employer is made

liable for the payment of the tax. By regulation, pursuant to Title VIII,6 the Treasury Department has explicitly ruled that the tax may be assessed against the
employer, regardless of whether he has in fact deducted
it from the employee's wages. The Circuit Court of
Appeals held that the employer was liable "only as an
agent bound to pay whether its duty to collect was performed or not" and that his liability was for a debt rather
than for taxes. 118 F. 2d 537.
As authority for this view, it relied upon its decision of
the same date in City of New York v. Feiring, 118F. 2d
329. The city sales tax involved in that case was laid
upon receipts from sales of personal property. The vendor was required to collect the amount of the tax from the
vendee separately from the sales price. He was obliged
to report periodically concerning his receipts from sales
and to turn over to the City Comptroller the taxes due,
whether or not he had actually collected them from the
purchasers. If the vendor failed to collect the tax, the
vendee Was required to report the transaction and to pay
the tax directly. Thus, the procedure contemplated was
that the purchaser should bear the burden of the tax,
but that the seller should collect and transmit it to the
Comptroller. If the seller did not obtain it from the
purchaser, however, the Comptroller was authorized to
proceed to collect it from either of them. The Circuit
Court of Appeals held that the claim of the City against
a bankrupt vendor for the amount of the sales tax outstanding was a claim for a debt and not for taxes, within
the meaning of § 64 (a) (4). We reverged this decision
and held that the burden imposed upon the seller by the
city taxing act had "all the characteristics of a tax entitled to priority" under § 64 (a) (4). 313 U. S. 283.

UNITED STATES v. NEW YORK.

Opinion of the Court.

We think that our decision in the Feiring case is controlling here. The New York City sales tax involved in
that case and the obligation imposed by §§ 801 and 802
of Title VIII of the Social Security Act cannot be distinguished in any material respect. It was observed in
the Feiring case that, while the sales tax was intended to
rest upon the purchaser "in its normal operation," "both
the vendor and the vendee are made liable for payment
of the tax in invitum . . . and the tax may be summarily
collected by distraint of the property of either the seller
or the buyer." 313 U. S. 283, at 287. The burden of
the tax provided for by §§ 801 and 802 likewise will normally rest upon the employee, but the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue may proceed to collect it from the employer whether or not he has deducted it from the wages
of the employee.
Two distinctions between the cases are urged by the
State. One is that § 802 (a) of Title VIII provides that
the tax "shall be collected by the employer of the taxpayer" and thus reveals a Congressional intent that only
a claim against the employee should be treated as one for
a tax. The other asserted distinction is that Title VIII
in its entirety is designed to impose two distinct taxes;
§ 801 imposes an "income tax" upon the employee, while
§ 804 imposes an "excise tax" upon' the employer.7 But a
tax for purposes of § 64 (a) (4) includes any "pecuniary
burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose
of supporting the Government," by whatever name it may

to employment (as defined in § 811) after such date: (1) With respect
to employment during the calendar years 1937, 1938, and 1939, the
rate shall be 1 per centum." U. S. C., Title 42, § 1004,

be called. New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483, 492.
Although he may not be referred to in §§ 801 and 802 as
the taxpayer, and although he may also be subject to the
"excise tax" prescribed by § 804, the plain fact is that the
employer is liable for the § 801 tax whether or not be has
collected it from his employees. We therefore hold that
the Title VIII claim of the United States against the estate
of this bankrupt employer is entitled to the priority
afforded by § 64 (a) (4).
Second. The claim under Title IX. Section 901 imposes upon this employer, in addition to the obligations
discussed above, an "excise tax" equal to 2 per centum
of the total wages payableby him during 1937. Section
902, however; permits him to credit "against the tax imposed by § 901" the amount of his 1937 contributions to
the state unemployment fund, but provides that the total
credit "shall not exceed 90 per centum of the tax against
which it is credited."
(a) The State contends that § 902 (a) in effect exacts a
penalty, equal to 90% of the amount of the tax levied
by § 901, from an employer who fails to make the payments to the state unemployment fund required by state
law. Since § 57 (j) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that
claims by the United States for penalties are not allowable,8 it argues, only 10% of the tax imposed by § 901 is
actually a tax for purposes of § 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act. There is no merit to this contention. While
the issue here is cast in somewhat different terms, it is
similar in outline to that raised by the constitutional objection to the Act which was set to rest in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548. There it was argued
that the 90% credit provisions amounted to coercion of
the States which was repugnant to the Tenth Amendment
and to the federal system. The Court recognized that
the effect of the scheme was to encourage the States to

Opinion of the Court.

establish and maintain unemployment insurance funds
and thus to coSperate with the federal government in
meeting a common problem. It observed that "every
rebate from a tax when conditioned upon conduct is in
some measure a temptation" but it concluded that "to
hold that motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion
is to plunge the law in endless difficulties," and to accept
"a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes
impossible." 301 U. S. at 589-590. These considerations are equally pertinent to the suggestion that the 90%
rebate arrangement constitutes the imposition of a "penalty" within the meaning of § 57 (j) upon an employer
who fails or refuses to contribute to a state fund. The
amount of the tax assessable under § 901 is definite and
fixed, once the single variable, the total of the wages paid
during the year, is determined. Although the employer
is free to obtain a credit.against it by contributing to his
state fund, it cannot be said that it is any the less a tax
because the employer has failed, either through choice or
lack of resources, to make such a contribution. Either
the state or the federal government must provide the
money to meet the requirements of relief to the unemployed. By his contributions to the State, an employer
has diminished the demand upon the financial resources
of the federal government. But by his failure to contribute, the employer has increased this demand and sharpened the necessity for obtaining the revenues required,
to satisfy it. The effort by the United States to obtain
the revenue by denying the credit must be regarded as
the levying of a tax and not as the exaction of a
penalty.9
In 1939 Congress undertook to put an end to any doubts on this
question by providing in § 902 (i) of the amendments to the Social
Security Act that no part of the tax imposed by Title IX should be
deemed a penalty or forfeiture within the meaning of § 57 (j) of the
Bankruptcy Act. C.666, 53 Stat. 1360, 1400.

Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

(b) Finally the State contends that the District Court
applied an incorrect formula in determining the amount
of the credit deductible under § 902. Section 902 provides: "The taxpayer may credit against the tax imposed
by § 901 of this chapter the amount of contributions, with
respect to employment during the taxable year, paid by
him (before the date of filing his return for the taxable
year) 10 into an unemployment fund under a state law.
The total credit allowed to a taxpayer under this section
for all contributions paid into unemployment funds with
respect to employment during such taxable year shall not
exceed 90 per centum of the tax against which it is credited
."

In the case of a bankrupt who has not made any

contribution to the state unemployment fund at the time
of adjudication and whose assets are insufficient to meet
the total of the claims of equal priority, the calculation of
the credit is beset with some difficulty. The amount
available for the state's claim for its unemployment insurance fund is contingent upon the sums allowed on the
other claims, including that of the federal government
under § 901. The amount to be allowed on the claim of
the United States is in turn dependent upon the credit
deductible from it under the terms of § 902. And this
credit under § 902 is determined by the sum granted on
the state's unemployment insurance fund claim.
Because of this mutual dependence, the courts below
have accepted and approved an algebraic solution of the
'This condition had not been complied with in the present case.
However, the 1939 amendments to the Social Security Act, which
resulted in the dismissal of the first appeal by stipulation, provided
that the credit should be allowed on payments to the state fund
"without regard to the date of payment, if the assets of the taxpayer
are, at any time during the fifty-nine-day period following such date
of enactment, in the custody or control of a receiver, trustee, or other
fiduciary appointed by, or under the control of, a court of competent
jurisdiction." § 901 (a) (3). C. 666, 53 Stat. 1360, 1399. This
bankrupt @ate qualified under this provision.

Opinion of the Court.

problem. Under this solution, the claim for the tax
assessed under § 901 is diminished by subtracting from it
an amount equal to the sum allowed to the State for its
unemployment fund. The formula by which this is accomplished is reducible to a quadratic equation capable
of solution by the recognized method.
As against this algebraic solution, the State urges an
arithmetical calculation which would afford it a larger
share of the assets. In brief, the state's theory is as follows: The amount of each of the several claims of the
State and of the United States should be divided by the
total of such claims. The percentage of the assets due on
each claim is thus determined. The total of the assets
available is then multiplied in turn by these percentages,
and the actual sum to be allowed on each claim is found.
However, the amount allowed on the federal government's
claim under § 901 is then multiplied by 10%. The sum
equal to this 10% is thereupon conclusively granted to
the United States. But the remaining amount, equal
to 90%, is returnedto the estate as a second fund to be
divided among all the claims in the same manner. The
share of this second fund which by this computation
would go to the United States on its § 901 claim is again
multiplied by 10%, with the balance of 90% returning to
form a third fund. The process is repeated until the still
undistributed assets reach a vanishing point.
It will be observed that while the one solution is algebraic and the other arithmetic, there is little to choose
between them in terms of complexity. The obvious fact
is that neither the Bankruptcy Act nor the Social
Security Act affords the courts any meaningful assistance
in solving the problem raised by this case. And their
legislative history is equally barren.
The State objects to the formula applied below because its effect is to accord the United States a larger
sum in dollars and cents on its § 901 claim than it would

receive if the available assets were sufficient to discharge
in full all of the priority claims. This is true because,
under § 902, the United States would be entitled to no

more than 10% of its §901 claim if the unemployment
fund claim of the State was paid in full. We agree that
this result is somewhat incongruous. However, the
method of computation urged by the State embodies so
basic an error that we cannot accept it. Section 902 permits the credit "against the tax imposed by §901."
Under the state's formula the credit is reckoned in terms
of a sum determined by that formula to be actually
available to the United States on its § 901 claim rather
than in terms of the whole amount actually due under
that section. We think that the words "the tax imposed" must mean "the tax demanded" or "assessed" or
"due." It can hardly be thought to mean "the tax paid"
or "the amount available for payment of the tax." The
formula adopted by the District Court avoids this error
by crediting the undetermined sum available to the
state unemployment fund against the total tax assessed
or claimed under § 901. We therefore hold that the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals did not err
in adopting and using that formula.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed with respect to the claim under Title VIII, but is
otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to permit the
reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.
