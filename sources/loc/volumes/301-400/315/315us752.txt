JACOB v. NEW YORK CITY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 589. Argued March 6, 1942.-Decided March 30, 1942.
1. Contributory negligence and assumption of risk are not available
as defenses to suits under the Jones Act; the admiralty doctrine
of comparative negligence applies. P. 755.
2. Upon the evidence, the plaintiff in this action under the Jones Act
for personal injuries suffered in a fall caused by his use of a defective
wrench, which he had asked his superior to replace, was entitled
to have the case submitted to the jury on the issue whether his injuries resulted from defect or insufficiency, due -to the employer's
negligence, in its appliances; and the dismissal of his complaint was
a denial of his statutory right of jury trial. P. 756.
3. Under the Jones Act, it is a duty of the employer to furnish reasonably safe and suitable simple tools when he is aware that those in
use are defective; the employee need not furnish his own simple
tools when he finds those of the employer defective. P. 758.
4. The trial court's exclusion of opinion evidence as to the best type
of tool for the work, was not error warranting reversal. P. 758.
119 F. 2d 800, reversed.
CERTIORARI,

314 U. S. 595, to review the affirmance of a

judgment dismissing the complaint in an action for personal injuries under the Jones Act.

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The right of jury trial in civil cases at common law is
a basic and fundamental feature of our system of federal
jurisprudence which is protected by the Seventh Amendment. A right so fundamental and sacred to the citizen,

whether guaranteed by the Constitution or provided by
statute, should be jealously guarded by the courts. The
present case is a suit by petitioner under the Jones Act'
for personal injuries sustained when he fell because the
wrench he was using to tighten a nut slipped under the
torque applied to it. We are called upon to determine
whether on the eVidence adduced by petitioner, and in
contravention of accepted juridical standards, petitioner
was wrongfully deprived of his statutory right to jury
trial by the action of the trial court in dismissing his
complaint,' thereby refusing to submit the case to a jury
which had been duly empanelled to try it. In holding
that petitioner had failed to prove facts sufficient to warrant submitting the issue of respondent's negligence to
the jury, the trial court relied on the so-called simple tool
doctrine. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 119
F. 2d 800. โข The novel questions thus presented in the
administration of the Jones Act prompted us to grant
certiorari. 314 U. S. 595.
Petitioner's testimony I is the complete answer to the
question whether the case should have been taken from
'41 Stat. 988, 1007, 46 U. S. C. ยง 688.
'The complaint set forth two causes of action-the first for personal injuries, and the second for maintenance and cure. Respondent moved to dismiss only the first cause of action. At the same
time, in settlement of the second cause of action, respondent offered
to consent to judgment for loss of wages from the time of the accident until petitioner returned to work. This offer was refused by
petitioner's counsel and the second cause was thereupon dismissed.
The Circuit Court of Appeals, sua sponte, directed that judgment
be entered on the second cause of action for petitioner, in the amount
admitted to be due from respondent. That judgment is not in issue
here. Only the first cause of .Action, that, for personal injuries, survives for our consideration.

'Petitioner was the sole witness in his own behalf. The trial court
did not allow an opinion witness, called for the purpose of establishing the best type of wrench for the work petitioner was doing at the
time of the accident, to testify.

the jury. The gist of that testimony is as follows: For
three weeks prior to the accident, petitioner, an employee with twenty years' experience, had been serving
as water-tender in charge of the fire-room on the "Dongan Hills," a ferryboat operated by respondent between
Staten and Manhattan Islands in New York harbor.
One of his duties was to change oil strainers. This was
done about three times a week, and required the removal and replacement of a manifold head, housing the
strainers, which was held in place by six studs and nuts.
When the manifold was replaced, the nuts had to be very
tight. The best tool to remove and to tighten the nuts
was a straight end wrench fitting a 11/4" nut. Petitioner
used an S-shaped end wrench of the proper size which
was "well worn," "had seen a lot of service," was "a
loose fit," and "had a lot of play on it." There was about
one-sixteenth of an inch "play in the jaws; it was worn."
The
wrench was about eighteen inches long and the
4play"
at the end was "about an inch." Petitioner
asked the chief engineer for a new wrench three times,
the first request being when petitioner first had occasion to use the worn wrench to change an oil strainer,
and the last, two or three days before the accident. In
answer to this last request, the chief engineer "said for
me [petitioner] to look in the tool closet and see if there
was one in there; and I went up there and couldn't find
any and I believe he said he sent an order out for one."
The regular way of requisitioning needed tools was by a
report to the chief engineer. All petitioner was supposed
to do was order; he did not know what respondent kept
in its storeroom. The "Dongan Hills" docked at Manhattan Island on the average of six or seven times each
day. On the day of the accident, petitioner did not renew his request, but he did look in the chief engineer's
tool set. He found no end wrench of the proper size, did
not know if a Stillson wrench was there, but believed

JACOB v. NEW YORK.

Opinion of the Court.

that a monkey wrench was. A monkey wrench could
"probably" be used on any nut. At the time of the accident, petitioner was using the worn, S-shaped, end
wrench to tighten the nuts after changing the oil
strainer. There was about five-eighths of an inch of
thread on the studs, and petitioner had changed the
wrench on one nut 'four times. As he started the fifth
tightening, the wrench slipped, causing him to fall from
the eighteen inch square platform on which he was
standing to the catwalk eighteen inches below. In the
course of the fall, petitioner sustained an injury to his
right side, which struck an angle iron alongside the
catwalk.
The Jones Act, in addition to giving injured seamen the
right to trial by jury in actions arising under the Act, also
incorporates "all statutes of the United States modifying
or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of
personal injury to railway employees." Among such
statutes is 45 U. S. C. ยง 51, which provides in part that a
carrier is liable for "injury or death ... by reason of any
defect or insufficiency, due to its [the carrier's] negligence,
in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed,
works, boats, wharves, or other equipment."
Although proof of negligence is an essential to recovery
under the Jones Act, Kunschman v. United States, 54 F.
2d 987; cf. Beadle v. Spencer, 298 U. S.124, 128, contributory negligence and assumption of risk are not available
defenses. The admiralty doctrine of comparative negligence applies. Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S.
424. The salient points of petitioner's testimony, summarized above, made a sufficient showing to allow the
jury to consider the issue of respondent's negligence.
The wrench petitioner was using had become defective
for the purpose for .which it was designed. After discovering that defect, petitioner made three requests to the
proper person, the chief engineer, for a new wrench. The

first of those requests was about three weeks prior to the
accident, the last but two or three days before it occurred.
At that time, the chief engineer said he sent out an order
for one, but it was not forthcoming in the two or three
days intervening before the accident, despite the fact that
the "Dongan Hills" docked at Manhattan Island six or
seven times a day. While the best tool for doing the work
was a straight end wrench of the proper size, petitioner
had access to a monkey wrench which "probably" could
be used on any nut. We think these facts entitled petitioner to have the jury consider whether his injury was
caused by any "defect or insufficiency, due to its [respondent's] negligence, in its appliances." That is to say, it
was for the jury to decide whether a monkey wrench was a
reasonably safe and suitable tool for petitioner's work,
whether respondent's failure, although it had at least
two days' and possibly three weeks' notice of the defect,
to supply petitioner with a new wrench amounted to
negligence on its part, and whether respondent, after it
had knowledge of the defect, might not have reasonably
foreseen the possibility of resulting harm if it allowed the
worn wrench to remain in use. Cf. Socony-Vacuum Co.
v. Smith, supra. Without doubt the case is close and a
jury might find either way. But that is no reason for a
court to usurp the function of the jury. We are satisfied
that a due respect for the statutory guaranty of the right
of jury trial, with its resulting benefits, requires the submission of this case to the jury.
The simple tool doctrine, used by the courts below to
bolster their belief that the evidence was insufficient, does
not affect our conclusion. In the first place, the contrariety of opinion as to the reasons for and the scope of the
simple tool doctrine, and the uncertainty of its application,' suggest that it should not apply to cases arising' under
See 3 Labatt, Master and Servant (2d ed.), pp. 2476-2484.

Opinion of the Court.

legislation, such as the Jones Act, designed to enlarge in
some measure the rights and remedies of injured employees.' But even assuming its applicability, the
doctrine does not justify withdrawing this case from the
jury. For the only possible basis for the doctrine which is
compatible with the provisions and policy of the Jones Act
is that the master is not negligent in the case of defective
simple tools because the possibility of injury from such
tools is so slight as to impose no duty on him to see that
they are free from defects in the first instance or to inspect
them thereafter,6 Newbern v. Great Atlantic & Pacific
Tea Co., 68 F. 2d 523; cf. Hedicke v. HighlandSprings Co.,
185 Minn. 79, 239 N. W. 896-or to put it another way,
the master is relieved of the duty to inspect simple tools
for defects because the servant's opportunity for ascertaining such defects is equal to or greater than the
master's. O'Hara v. Brown Hoisting Mach. Co., 171 F.'
394; Miller v. Erie R. Co., 21 App. Div. (N. Y.) 45, 47
N. Y. S. 285; 2 Agency A. L. I. ยง 503 (d). Petitioner inspected the wrench, found it defective and then asked
three times for a new one. This satisfied the burden of
inspection placed on his shoulders by the doctrine, and it
was then for the jury to say whether respondent's failure
to comply with those repeated requests was negligence on
' Compare McCarthyv. Palmer,113 F. 2d 721, with Spain v. Powell,
90 F. 2d 580.

' If the doctrine is but a phase of assumption of risk or contributory
negligence, as has been suggested (see Labatt, op. cit., pp. 2479, 2480,

2484), it is manifestly not applicable to actions under the Jones Act,
for those common-law affirmative defenses are not available in such
actions. Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S. 424.

And, if the scope of the doctrine is that a master is under no duty
to furnish reasonably safe and suitable simple tools (see Allen Gravel
Co. v. Yarbrough, 133 Miss. 652, 98 So. 117; Middleton v. National

Box Co., 38 F. 2d 89), the doctrine is hardly compatible with the
scheme of the.Jones Act fixing liability on a master for injuries caused
by defects and insufficiencies in his appliances due to his negligence.

its part. To deny petitioner the right to have the jury
pass on that issue because of the simple tool doctrine is to
say that doctrine relieves the master of any duty to furnish
reasonably safe and suitable simple tools in spite of the
fact that he knows they are defective, and requires the
servant not only to inspect simple tools for defects, but
also to supply his own simple tools when he finds those
of the master defective.. This is so obvious a perversion
of the Jones Act as to require no comment.7
Since there must be a new trial, we deem it appropriate
to state that, in our opinion, no reversible error was committed when the trial court refused to allow opinion
testimony as to the best type of tool for the work.' Respondent's duty was not to supply the best tools, but only
tools which were reasonably safe and suitable. Cf. The
Tawmie, 80 F. 2d 792; The Cricket,71 F. 2d 61.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the
District Court for further proceedings in conformity with
this opinion.
