WHITE ET AL., FORMER COLLECTORS OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. WINCHESTER COUNTRY CLUB.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 63. Argued December 12, 1941.-Decided January 12, 1942.
1. In the case of a club to which amounts paid as "dues or membership fees" are taxable under § 501 of the Revenue Act of 1926,
as amended by § 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928, payments made
to it for the right to repeated and general use of a common club
facility for an appreciable period of time, and not fixed by each
occasion of actual use, are subject to the tax. So held of charges
for certain golf and family privileges. P. 41.
2. A lone District Court decision construifig an-Act of Congress is
not to be regarded as a well settled interpretation; and subsequent
reenactments of the provision so construed are not necessarily to
be taken as a legislative approval of such construction. P. 40.
117 F. 2d 146, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 313 U. S. 555, to review the affirmance,
upon a consolidated appeal of judgments for the Club
in three suits against three former Collectors of Internal Revenue to recover taxes alleged to have been wrongfully exacted. The Club sued as agent for the members
who paid the taxes. The cases were tried to the District
Court upon waivers of a jury. Opinion of District Court,
30 F. Supp. 192.

Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and
Messrs. Edward First and Richard S. Salant were on the
brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Charles W. Mulcahy, with whom Mr. John P. Carr
was on the brief, for respondent.
"Dues or membership fees" include only those payments which are requisite to membership in the club.

WHITE v. WINCHESTER CLUB.

Opinion of the Court.

The payments for golf privileges were not required by
virtue of membership. On the contrary, these privileges
were acquired by members entirely at their option. They
could be informally obtained and surrendered at will
without affecting one's status as a member. In no way
were they fixed and definite charges applicable to all
members of a particular class of membership, nor did they
represent a recurring obligation extending over an indefinite period of time. See Foran v. McLaughlin, 59 F. 2d

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
We must decide whether members' payments to the
Winchester Country Club for certain "privileges" constituted "dues or membership fees" subject to the tax
imposed by § 501 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9,
92, as amended by § 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45
Stat. 791, 864, on amounts paid "as dues or membership
fees to any social, athletic, or sporting club or organization, if the dues or fees of an active resident annual member are in excess of $25 per year."
Since 1929 and during the period here in question the
Club's by-laws provided for "Annual Dues" of $50, which
entitled a member to all the privileges of the Club except
golf. By paying $35 more, for "Limited Privileges," a
member became entitled to play golf during the year, except on specified days; by paying $50, for "Full Privileges,"
he got the privilege of playing at any time during the

315 U. S.

year. All but a small portion of the members acquired
golf privileges of one sort or the other.
Various forms of "Family Privileges," entitling one or
more of a member's family to use the clubhouse and to
play tennis and golf, could be had by a member upon
payment of specified additional sums, which were less if
he had golf privileges than if he did not.
The club year began January first and, according to the
by-laws, "dues and fees" were payable on March first.
The practice was to bill members during March for "dues"
and "privileges" for the year. Privileges were acquired
informally, the practice being to let the Club's officers
know either orally or in writing what privileges were desired. A member was billed for the privileges he had
previously held if he had not indicated that he no longer
desired them, but if he later gave notice that he did not
desire a given privilege, no attempt was made to collect
the amount billed for it. If a member requested priviliges prior to August first, he was billed for the full year;
for privileges thereafter requested he was billed for only
half a year. Suitable adjustment was aljso made if privileges were dropped in the middle of the year.
During the period from November 27, 1931, to January 9, 1935, taxes in the amount of $9,211.25 were exacted
on account of payments to the Club for the various "privileges" mentioned above. On November 16, 1935, the
Club duly filed claims for refund on behalf of its members,
and, after the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had
rejected them, it instituted suits in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts against
the three Collectors of Internal Revenue to whom the
taxes had been paid. The District Court entered judgments for the Club, and the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit affirmed them upon consolidated
appeal. 117 F. 2d 146. Certiorari was granted in this

case and in Merion Cricket Club v. United States, decided
by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 119 F. 2d
578, because of an asserted conflict between the two decisions. 313 U. S.555; 314 U. S. 589.
The generality of "dues or membership fees," the words
by which the governing statute designates the payments
upon which the tax is laid, necessitates consideration of
their legislative background. Earlier Revenue Actsthose of 1917, 1918, 1921, and 1924-had laid a tax in the
same terms upon payments to clubs such as the
respondent.'
The Treasury construed these words on several occasions not long after they were first employed in these
Revenue Acts. Treasury Regulations 43 (Part 2), Art. 12,
issued under the Revenue Act of 1918, and approved
March 28, 1919, gave as examples of their applicability
the following: "(5) A certain golf club's dues are $15
per year. Of this amount $10 is expended in the purchase
for the member of a season ticket to a municipal golf
course. The whole $15 is, nevertheless, taxable as dues.
(6) A certain golf club charges a 'green' fee of $1 for
each guest that uses the course. Such a fee is not paid
'as dues or membership fees,' and is, therefore, not taxable
as such. (7) The members of a certain curling club pay
annual dues of $20. By the payment of $10 extra per year
the privilege of skating on the club's rink can be secured
for the member's family. A payment of this extra $10
is taxable as a membership fee." The same examples are
given in this Article as revised on December 3, 1920, with
the addition of the following example: "(13) A certain
golf club, the dues and fees of which are taxable, issues to

wives of members cards entitling them to the use of the
tcourse for one year, making a charge of $10 therefor. The
amounts paid for such cards are taxable."
These examples were retained in three subsequent editions of the Regulations, issued under the Revenue Acts
of 1921 and 1924, which also added the generalized statements that subject to the tax "are extra charges which are
imposed upon members for the privilege of using certain
additional facilities for a period of time, as, for example,
an additional charge of $60 per annum imposed upon
members of a country club fpr the privilege of using the
golf links. A 'greens fee' charged to a guest s not taxable,
unless the right or privilege granted in return is for a
period of time, such as a season." '
Further, albeit slight, evidence of the Treasury's view is
found in S. T. 357, Cum. Bul. I-1, p. 434, as follows:
"Where a payment for the use of golf links or similar privilege afforded by a club . . . covers a period of time, such
as a season, it is subject to the tax on dues . . . This
applies alike to payments made by members and nonmembers."
On December 30, 1925, the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts held, however, that a
charge to a member for the use of a club's golf course for
a period of six months was not included within the words
"dues or membership fees," on the ground that they "were
meant to cover only fixed and definite charges applicable
to all members of each particular class of membership."

No appeal from this decision was perfected, a bill of
exceptions being withdrawn by the Government on March
23, 1926. The Revenue Act of 1926 which, like its prede3Treasury

of the Regulations was promulgated which omitted all

The Revenue Act of 1928, containing an express definition
of "dues and membership fees" in a respect not here material,' was enacted while the Regulation was in the same

the Weld case. Subsequent editions of the Treasury Regulations, issued after the enactment of the Revenue Act of
1928 and before any further statutory treatment Of the
subject, retained example (6), but substituted for example
(5) the following: "A certain golf club has two classes of
members. Class A members pay $40 per year dues and
are entitled to the full privileges of the club, including
the use of the golf course. Class B members pay $25
per year dues and are entitled to the privileges of the clubhouse, but do not enjoy the privilege of the golf course.
The total dues of $40 paid by class A members are subject
to tax, and, since the dues of such members are in excess
of $25 per year, the dues of $25 paid by class B members
are also subject to the tax." '

Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

During a period after the decision of the Weld case, the
Treasury apparently sought to determine taxability under
the doctrine of that case, rather than according to its own
prior views. In 1930, and before the beginning of the
period involved in this case, there issued, however, a General Counsel's Memorandum 7 which, while paying lip
service to the doctrine of the Weld case, construed and
applied it in such manner as to require the imposition of a
tax on facts apparently substantially similar to those before us here. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has
consistently followed this decision since its promulgation. Efforts were made in cases subsequently litigated
in the courts to obtain decisions fixing the meaning of
"definite and fixed charge" and "particular class of membership" as used in the statement of the Weld doctrine,
resulting in holdings of taxability in three instances,' and
of nontaxability in three besides the present.9 Foranv.
McLaughlin, 59 F. 2d 158, certiorari denied, 287 U. S. 637,
the first court decision rendered after the decision of the
Weld case itself, held that the payments in question did
constitute dues or membership fees. Since the decision of
this case, the Commissioner has allowed no claims for refunds on the basis of the Weld case, as he had done in
some previous instances.
Section 543 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1941, c. 412,
55 Stat. 687, 711, the first statutory treatment of the subject since the Revenue Act of 1928, explicitly defined
"dues," and thereby clearly included the types of pay' G. C. M. 7505, Cum. Bul. IX-2, p. 414.

ments here in question. 10 The legislative history of this
redefinition is inconclusive in respect of the earlier intention of Congress. 1 The action of Congress in thus explicitly defining the existing statutory term is at least as
consistent with dissatisfaction on its part with the course
of judicial decision as to its meaning as with the existenc:
of an intention to change the law. If any inference is
to be drawn from this spelling out of the meaning of
"dues," it is one supporting the validity of the construction set forth and adhered to by the Treasury before the
Weld case, which was substantially adopted by the newly
enacted definition. Compare Mason v. Routzahn, 275
U. S. 175, 178.
Nor do we find the renactments of the words "fees or
membership dues," while the Weld case was on the books,
to be controlling, or even significant, as expressions of Congressional intent. Passage of the Revenue Act of 1926 so
soon after the decision of the Weld case, and while the
Treasury Regulation dealing in terms with the same problem was still in force on the books, of course avails the
respondent nothing.,
So far as we have been able to ascertain, the Treasury's
revision of the Regulation was made in the belief that it
was bound to follow the Weld case; we cannot assume that
the Treasury did more than bow to the District Court.
The revision of the Regulation is of ambiguous import,
but in any event it signifies no voluntary change in the
opinion of the Treasury as to the meaning of the statute.
Even if we could assume that the Treasury made a complete and voluntary about face after the decision of the
"The term 'dues' includes any assessment, irrespective of the
purpose for which made, and any charges for social privileges or

facilities, or for golf, tennis, polo, swimming, or other athletic or
sporting privileges or facilities, for any period of more than six
days . .."

Weld case and before the enactment of the 1928 Act, and
that the new doctrine came within the scope of the cases
applying the "rebnactment rule," 12 this would be bootless
to the petitioner, whose claim covers a period commencing
after the 1930 decision of the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, supra, which favors the imposition of the tax here. If this decision marked a departure from doctrine espoused by the Treasury after the
Weld case, it was a departure which was within the power
of the Treasury to make for the period iii question. 3
Nor was the Weld case itself in any sense adopted by
the enactment of the 1928 Act. It stood alone when that
Act was passed, and "one decision construing an act does
not approach' the dignity of a well settled interpretation." "' It was patently incomplete as an exposition of
doctrine, and as a District Court decision it had quite
restricted direct applicability.
Having tested respondent's proffered constructional
qrutches and found them unsound, we must decide the
meaning of the statute without their aid. We reject the
doctrine of the Weld case as being intrinsically unsound,
and as having been demonstrated by subsequent cases to
be unworkable in practice. We also reject as an aid to
decision the inquiry made in several cases as to whether
the payment in question was in consequence of a "recurring contractual obligation," " since whether such is the
case depends ;.erely upon the mechanics of the particular
club's financcs-a properly immaterial factor.

Opinion of the Court.

Consideration of the nature of club activity is a necessary preliminary to the formulation of a test of what constitutes a "due or membership fee." So far as finances go,
the fundamental notion of club activity is that operating
expenses are shared without insistence upon equivalence
between the proportion of an individual's contributions
and the proportion of the benefits he receives.'
Thus, on
the one hand, payment of the price of an individual dinner
at the club dining room or of a single round of golf lacks
the element of making common cause inherent in the idea
of club activity. But, on the other hand, payment for
the right to repeated and general use of a common club
facility for an appreciable period of time has that element
and amounts to a "due or membership fee" if the payment
is not fixed by each occasion of actual use. Such wa the
case here, and we therefore hold that the payments in
question were subject to the tax.
These are, in substance, the views expressed by the
Treasury shortly after "dues or membership fees" was
first employed in the Revenue Acts, and consistently
pressed by the Treasury, except as it thought judicial
authority dictated otherwise. Its substantially contemporaneous expressions of opinion are highly relevant and
material evidence of the probable general understanding
of the times and of the opinions of men who probably
were active in the drafting of the statute: As such, they
are entitled to serious consideration, independently alike
of reenactments of the statute while it was in force on
the books and of any temporary abandonment in consequence of disregard by judicial decision. 7
