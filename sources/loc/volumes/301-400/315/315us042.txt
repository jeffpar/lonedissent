CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 83. Argued December 12, 1941.-Decided January 12, 1942.
Payments to a club by members for golf privileges, held taxable as
"dues or membership fees" under ยง 501 of the Revenue Act of
1926, as amended by ยง 413 of the Revenue Act of 1928. White v.

Winchester Country Club, ante, p. 32. P. 43.
119 F. 2d 578, affirmed.
CERTIORARI,

314 U. S. 589, to review the affirmance of a

judgment for the United States in a suit for a refund of
taxes.
Mr. John Lewis Evans for petitioner.
Mr. J. Louis Monarch, with whom Solicitor General
Fahy and Messrs. Michael H. Cardozo, IV, and Richard
S. Salant were on the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question in this case-whether amounts paid by
members of the Merion Cricket Club during the period
from July 1, 1931, to June 30, 1935, for golf privileges,
constituted payments as "dues or membership fees" subject to the tax imposed by ยง 501 of the Revenue Act of
1926, 44 Stat. 9, 92, as amended by ยง 413 of the Revenue
Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 864-does not differ in substance
from that decided this day in White v. Winchester Country
Club, ante, p. 32.
With- certain exceptions, a member of the Merion
Cricket Club could obtain annual golf privileges only by
payment of a fee, which varied in amount according to
his age and status. The fee was payable in two equal
installments, one on the first of January, and the other on

Opinion of the Court.

the first of July. A member admitted to golf privileges
after the latter date was entitled to remission of one-half
of the annual fees, but if one stopped using the golf
facilities during the year there was no proportionate refund. If a member elected to play golf he continued to
be liable for the succeeding year unless he gave notice of
withdrawal before the end of the year. Members who
paid the annual golf fees were entitled to use the golf facilities as often as they desired without further charge, and
could on occasion obtain golf privileges for their wives
and guests.
. After a claim for refund of the amounts alleged to have
been paid as taxes on the annual golf fees had been duly
filed and rejected, the Club on its own behalf and on behalf of its members sued the United States in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover them. The District Court entered a
judgment for the United States which was affirmed on
appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 119 F. 2d 578. Certiorari was granted in this case
and in White v. Winchester Country Club, ante, p. 32,
because of an asserted conflict between the decisions below. 313 U. S. 555; 314 U. S. 589.
In this case, as in White v. Winchester Country Club,
supra, we hold that amounts paid were paid as "dues or
membership fees," since they were for rights to the repeated and general use of a common club facility for an
appreciable period of time, and were not fixed by each
occasion of actual use.
The decision below is therefore
Affirmed.
MR. JusTicE ROBERTS took no part in the decision of this
case.
