CLOVERLEAF BUTTER CO. v. PATTERSON, COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIES OF ALABAMA, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 28. Argued December 9, 10, 1941.-Decided February 2, 1942.
1. Acting under authority of a state statute, state officials inspected and seized packing stock butter acquired by a manufacturer for use in the manufacture of renovated butter for interstate.
commerce. Ield that such state action was inconsistent with
and excluded by the federal laws and regulations relating to the
manufacture of renovated butter. Internal Revenue Code, §§
2320-2327. P. 167.
2. By the regulatory provisions of Internal Revenue Code, § 2325,
the entire process of manufacture of renovated butter is subject
to federal supervision. P. 154.
3. The federal legislation involved here is not solely a revenue
measure; it is authorized by the Commerce Clause. P. 162.
4. Section 1 of the Act of May 9, 1902, providing that importations
of 'renovated butter shall be subject to the laws of the State as
though produced therein,, is inapplicable 'to the present case.
P. 161.
5. The effect of § 4,of the Act of May 9, 1902, is that state action
in respect of renovated butter is not foreclosed merely by federal
taxation in this field. Such state action may, however, as here,
be superseded by the exercise of other federal power. P. 162.
6. Where Congress exercises its power over interstate commerce by
legislation with which a regulation by the State conflicts, either
expressly or impliedly, such state regulation becomes inoperative
and the federal legislation exclusive in its application. Pp. 155156.

Argument for Respondents.

Messrs. Charles L. Rowe and William H. Loeb, Assistant 'Attorney General of Alabama, argued the cause, and
Mr. Thomas S. Lawson, Attorney General, and Mr. Loeb
were on the brief, for respondents.
The protection of the health of its citizens is an inherent power of the State. So long as the exercise of this
power does not conflict with the federal laws, the State
may act without limitation. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230
U. S. 352, 398-412; South Carolina Highway Dept. v.
Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S. 177, 184, 188-191; Eichholz v.
Public Service Comm'n, 306 U. S. 268, 274.
The State may prohibit within its borders the manufacture of adulterated food, where part of that food will
be sold to its citizens. Such action does not violate the
Commerce Clause even though its effect is to impose a
burden on interstate commerce. Clason v. Indiana, 306
U. S. 439; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U. S.
407, 505; Carey v. South Dakota, 250 U. S. 118; Corn
Products Rfg. Co. v. Eddy, 249 U. S. 427; Weigle v. Curtice Bros. Co., 238 U. S. 285; Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S.
52; Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501; Crossmanv. Lurman,
192 U. S. 189; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U. S. 461;
Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678. See also: Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69; California v. Thompson,
313 U. S.109.
Congress has not exclusively occupied the field by the
Renovated Butter Act; nor has it, by such Act, regulated
interstate commerce so completely as to prohibit state
action. The Act is not intended as a regulation of commerce. It is but an extension of the Oleomargarine Act,
which was a taxing Act. In re Kollock, 165 U. S. 526,
537.
The incorporation of R. S. § 3243 into the Renovated
Butter Act is a specific indication of the Congressional
intention to leave the State unrestricted in the exercise

150

Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

of its police power. Section 1 of the Act further indicates the will of Congress that, with respect to the regulation. of renovated butter, interstate commerce might be
subjected to restrictions by the States.
The purpose of § 1 was to permit the State to protect
the health of its citizens with respect to unclean butter,
even though such butter, renovated or packing stock,
might still remain in the original packages in which it
had been introduced into the State. See In re Rahrer,
140 U. S. 545; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland
Ry., 242 U. S. 311.
. State officers enforcing by seizure police regulations
with regard to foods will not be enjoined merely because
there exist similar federal laws and regulations in respect
to the same subject matter and there has been no federal
seizure.
The decision is controlled by Mintz v. Baldwin, 289
U. S. 346; Pacific States Co. v. White, 296 U. S. 176;
Kelly v. Washington, 302 U. S. 1; South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U. S. 177; Townsend v.
Yeomans, 301 U. S. 441; and Currin v. Wallace, 306

MR. JusTIcE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner, Cloverleaf Butter Company, is engaged
at Birmingham, Alabama, in the manufacture of process
or renovated butter from packing stock butter. It obtains
25% of its supplies of packing stock butter from the farmers and country merchants of Alabama and 75% from
those bf other states, and it ships interstate 90% of its
finished product. The production of renovated butter is
taxed And regulated by the United States. Internal Revenue Code, c. 16, §§ 2320 to 2327 inc. It is also regulated
by Alabama. Ala. Code 1940, Tit. 2, c. 1.
The respondents, Alabama officials charged with the
duty of enforcing the Alabama laws in regard to renovated

butter, entered petitioner's factory and, in a little more
than a year, seized on sixteen separate occasions a total of
over twenty thousand pounds of packing stock butter, the
material from which the finished product is made. Defendants also seized some butter moving to the factory in
interstate commerce. There is no allegation that condemnation proceedings have been completed.
Alleging repeated seizures and danger of their continuance, to the demoralization and financial impairment of
its business, petitioner brought an action, Judicial Code
§ 24 (1), in the District Court to enjoin the defendants
from acting under the Alabama statute, either to determine the wholesomeness of renovated butter made from
the raw material in petitioner's hands, to inspect its raw
material and plant, or to seize and to detain petitioner's
packing stock butter. The theory of the bill is that the
federal legislation and regulations concerning the manufacture of process or renovated butter exclude such state
action. Cf. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, 248 U. S. 297; Corn Products Rfg. Co. v. Eddy, 249 U. S. 427. There was a motion
to dismiss on the ground that the complaint did not state
a cause of action. A stipulation entitled as one of "facts"
was entered into. The District Court dismissed the bill,
the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 116 F. 2d 227, and
we granted certiorari because of the important question
of federal law involved in petitioner's contention that
these federal statutes providing for regulation of production of a commodity excluded state action. 313
I.S. 551.
The so-called stipulation of facts just mentioned is
really a limitation of issues. One paragraph of the stipulation will crystallize the essential elements of the dispute.
It reads: "The parties to this cause stipulate and agree
that the legal questions in dispute between the parties are:
: . . 2. Does the inspection of packing stock butter, in
interstate commerce, used by the plaintiff in the manufac-

ture of process or renovated butter as alleged in the bill of
complaint, made or directed to be made by the Secretary
of Agriculture of the United States, pursuant to the Federal laws and regulations relating to renovated or process
butter, have the effect in connection with said Federal laws
of excluding the State of Alabama, its officers and agents,
from inspecting or seizing or suspending the packing stock
butter, in interstate commerce out of which renovated
butter to be sold in interstate commerce as alleged in the
complaint is manufactured by the plaintiff as alleged in the
complaint?" As other paragraphs state variations of this
controversy, or conclusions of law not controlling on the
courts, Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U. S. 39,
51, we need not consider them -further. The central question presented in the petition for certiorari accords with
the excerpt from the stipulation.
Apparently there is no specific allegation or admission
that the packing stock butter which Alabama inspected
and seized was the property of the petitioning manufacturer at the time. It has, however, been so treated by the
courts and parties, and properly so, we conclude, from the
allegations of the bill.' The reach of this decision is therefore limited to Alabama's inspection and seizure of packing stock butter, actually owned by petitioner and held in
its own hands or those of its bailees, whether in factory,
IPetitioner, paragraph 19 of its bill of complaint, avers that packing
stock-butter is delivered to it for processing which is produced in Alabama and other states; that the Alabama officials, paragraph 20, claim
the right to enter the premises where it receives the butter acquired by
it in interstate commerce and to "seize, suspend or otherwise -deprive
plaintiff of the right to use such raw material or packing stock butter,
and to stop and search trucks moving in interstate commerce hauling

said raw material from places without the State of Alabama to plaimtiff's place of business in Birmingham, Alabama, and to seize, suspend
or otherwise deprive plaintiff the right to use the said raw material or
packing stock butter being so transported in interstate commerce and
to [stop and search] trucks transporting the aforesaid raw material

warehouse, or course of carriage, for manufacture into
process or renovated butter for interstate or foreign
commerce.
The test to be applied to the action of the state in seizing material intended solely for incorporation into a product prepared for interstate commerce is the effect of that
action upon the national regulatory policy declared by the
federal statute. Cf. Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central
Illinois Public Service Co., 314 U. S. 498, 505. Not only
from points in Alabama to plaintiff's plant in Birmingham, Alabama,
to be used in the manufacture of process or renovated butter as aforesaid."
Petitioner further avers, as to seizures at its plant, "Between, towit, the 17th day of April, 1939, and the 22nd day of June, 1940, defendants on 16 separate occasions, seized in Birmingham, Alabama, a
total of 20924 pounds of plaintiff's raw material or packing stock butter which originated in whole or in part, in states of the United States
outside of the State of Alabama and which had been so delivered to
the plaintiff's plant in Birmingham, Alabama, as raw material and which
was not being sold, offered or exposed for sale, or attempted for sale in
its then condition but was being held by the plaintiff solely and exclusively for the purpose of using the same as raw material out of which
to manufacture process or renovated butter in the usual course of
plaintiff's business.

. .

. Plaintiff avers on, to-wit, the 21st day of

June, 1940, in making the last seizure, above referred to, the defendants stopped a truck moving in interstate commerce from the State of
Georgia to the State of Alabama transporting said raw material known
as packing stock butter from the State of Georgia to the plaintiff in
Birmingham, Alabama. Plaintiff avers that as a result of the seizure of
said raw materials by defendants, it has been denied the use thereof;
the seizure and detention of said raw material has caused great financial loss to the plaintiff in that plaintiff is required to pay the storage
on the same and is denied the use of such raw materials that plaintiff
sorely needs in the conduct of its business, and has caused plaintiff's
plant to remain idle from time to time for the lack of sufficient raw
material to keep the same operating; that said action of the defendants
demoralizes plaintiff's employees who are employed, to operate said
plant, and is calculated to and does interfere with the sale of its finished
product in interstate commerce."

does Congressional power over interstate 6ommerce extend, the "Laws of. any State to the Contrary notwithstane;ig," 2 to interstate transactions and transportation,
but it reaches back to the steps prior to transportation and has force to regulate production "with the
purpose of so transporting" the product. United States
v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 117. It extends to the intrastate activities which so affect commerce as to make
regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment
of a legitimate end, regulation of interstate commerce.
Id., 118 et seq., and cases cited. By the regulatory provisions of I. R. C. § 2325, note 10, infra, the entire
process of manufacture is subject to federal supervision. Thus, so far as any situation here involved is concerned,. the scope of Congressional power is such that it
may override the exercise of state power and render impossible its application to petitioner's manufacturing
processes.
This power of Congress to exercise exclusive control
over operations in interstate commerce is not in dispute
here.' Nor is this power limited to' situations where
national uniformity is so essential that, lacking CongresConstitution, Article VI.
'Cases which sustain state enactments as permissible, where federal legislation generally applicable to the field exists, recegnize that
federal action might forbid or exclude the staLe statutes approved
in those instances. Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 529: "The question remains whether the statute of Indiana is in conflict with the
act of Congress known as the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906
( 4 Stat. 768, c. 3915). For the former, so far as it affects 'interstate commerce even indirectly and incidentally, can have no validity if repugnant to the Federal regulation." Corn Products Rig.

sional permission, all state action is inadmissible notwithstanding a complete absence of federal legislation.4
Exclusive federal regulation may arise, also, from the
exercise of the power of Congress over interstate commerce where, in the absence of Congressional action, the
states may themselves legislate. It has long been recognized that, in those fields of commerce where national
uniformity is not essential, either the state or federal
government may act. Willson v. Black-bird Creek
Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245; California v. Thompson, 313
U. S. 109, 114. Where this power to legislate exists, it
often happens that there is only a partial exercise of that
power by the federal government. In such cases the
state may legislate freely upon those phases of the commerce which are left unregulated by the nation.' But

where the United States exercises its power of legislation
so as to conflict with a regulation of the state, either
specifically' or by implication," the state legislation becomes inoperative and the federal legislation exclusive
in its application.
When the prohib'tion of state action is not specific but
inferable from the scope and purpose of the federal legislation, it must be clear that the federal provisions are
inconsistent with those of the state to justify the thwarting of state regulation.'
Apparently there are no cases of this Court dealing
specifically with state interference with federally regulated
manufactuting. It is evident, we think, that the same
principles 'govern state action in this field as in the instances cited under note 7 to show the exclusive power of
federal enactments in transportation, employers liabilshire, 306 U. S. 79 (maximum hours of employees regulated by state

Maurer v. Hamilton, 309 U. S. 598, 606 (state regulation of size and

ity, quarantine and aliens. The rule is clear that state
action may be excluded by clear implication or inconsistency. Its application to individual cases creates diffiCulties. The differentiation between cases where the
assumption of federal power is exclusive and where it
admits state action is narrow. For example, in OregonWashington R. Co. v. Washington, 270 U. S. 87, Section
8 of the Plant Quarantine Act, 37 Stat. 315, as amended 39
Stat. 1165, 7 U. S. C. § 161, was held to exclude a state
quarantine against plant infestation. Yet, a little later,
in Mintz v. Baldwin, 289 U. S. 346, a very similar statute,
the Cattle Contagious Diseases Act, was held to permit a
state quarantine, because this latter act differed from the
former, in that its provisions, page 352, "by specification
of the cases in which action under it shall be exclusive, disclose the intention of Congress that, subject to the limitations defined, state measures may be enforced. This
difference is essential and controlling." Cf. 21 U. S. C.
§ 126.
It is urged that the later Welch, Eichholz and Maurer
cases, cited above, which allow state action when the federal statute does not cover the particular point regulated,
show a trend away from the doctrine of the Oregon-Washington Co. -decision. Other similar instances may be
found in notes 3 and 5, supra. In all of these, however,
it was the ruling of this Court that the federal enactment
was consistent with the narrow regulation sought to be
enforced by the state, so that the state enactment did not
stand "as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress."
Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67. As the principle
upon which the cases referred to in this paragraph are
decided is clear, a single comparison will sufficiently illustrate the reasons which lead to a denial of state power.

for sale in Indiana while in interstate commerce. The
Pure Food and Drugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, prohibited, so far
as here pertinent, interstate shipments if misbranded by
bearing "any statement, design, or device . . .false or
misleading." This Court said, p. 532:
"Congress has thus limited the scope of its prohibitions.
It has not included that at which the Indiana statute aims.
Can it be said that Congress, nevertheless, has denied to
the State, with respect to the feeding stuffs coming from
another State and sold in the original packages, the power
the State otherwise would have to prevent imposition upon
the public by making a reasonable and nondiscriminatory provision for the disclosure of ingredients, and for
inspection and analysis?"
The Indiana Act was upheld. On the other hand, McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115, makes plain the basis
for prohibiting interferences with federal power. In this
latter case a Wisconsin law required glucose mixtures offered for retail sale to be labeled "Glucose flavored with"
the flavoring material. Any other "designation or brand"
on the package was prohibited. A glucose mixture was
offered labeled "Karo Corn Syrup" "10% Cane Syrup,
90% Corn Syrup." Pointing out that federal authority,
for the sake of efficiency in protecting the public against
misbranding in interstate trade, extended far enough to
regulate labeling on packages while being offered to consumers, and that the Pure Food and Drugs Act tolerated
the more euphemistic label prohibited by the state, this
Court said, p. 133:
"Conceding to the State the authority to make regulations consistent with the Federal law for the further protection of its citizens against impure and misbranded food
and drugs, we think to permit such regulation as is embodied in this statute is to permit a State to discredit and
burden legitimate Federal regulations of interstate commerce, to destroy rights arising out of the Federal statute

Opinion of the Court.

which have accrued both to the Government and the shipper, and to impair the effect of a Federal law which has
been enacted under the Constitutional power of Congress
over the subject."
In the Savage case, there was no conflict, inconsistency
or interference; in the McDermott case, there was.
McDermott pointed out the distinction, and the inapplicability of the Savage rule to the Wisconsin situation.
228 U. S. 115, 131-32.
Turning to the statutes in question, we find that the
greater part of the legislation relating to process or renovated butter is in § 2320 to § 2327 of the Internal Revenue
Code.' These sections define process or renovated butter,
fix the rate of poundage tax upon it, as well as the amount
of special tax upon its manufacturers, and provide for
their collection. They require manufacturers to file such
notices and inventories, keep such books, render such returns, post such signs, affix such number to his factory, and
furnish such bond as the Treasury Department may require. Wholesale dealers are required to keep books and
render returns to the same department. Penalties are
provided. Specific provisions are made for inspection of
the places of manufacture or storage of the materials and
the renovated butter itself. Power is given to confiscate
the finished product. Sanitary provisions applicable for
slaughtering, meat canning or similar establishments are
extended to cover process and renovated butter factories.
The sections necessary for the discussion are set out in the

it is improper to infer a restriction on confiscation of material when confiscation of product is permitted fails to
give weight to the difference between a confiscation which
interferes with production under federal supervision and
confiscation after production because of a higher standard
demanded by a state for its consumers. The latter type
is permissible under all the authorities.
(b) By § 4 of the same Act, R. S. § 3243 was made "to
extend to and include and apply to" manufacture of processed and renovated butter. That section, now I. R. C.
§ 3276, provides that the payment of the tax laid by the
act under consideration "shall not be held to exempt any
person from any" state penalty "or in any manner to authorize the commencement or continuance of such trade or
business contrary to the laws of such State." It is urged
by respondent that this section makes it "clear that the
power of the States over the subject of the manufacture
and sale of process and renovated butter within their respective limits was to be unrestricted, even though the
effect of such regulation might be the imposition of an indirect burden upon interstate commerce." This section
without doubt manifests the will of Congress that federal
taxation shall not, of itself, incapacitate the state. Austin
v. Tennessee, 179 U. S. 343; Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155
U. S. 461, 466. In our view, however, the section goes no
farther than to make certain that federal taxation shall
not paralyze state action. Other regulations may or may
not supersede state laws. Cf. Merchants Exchange v.
Missouri, 248 U. S. 365, 368; Hartford Indemnity Co. v.
Illinois, 298 U. S. 155, 159.
There are also two other elements of the federal legislation which may be considered from the negative viewpoint. This is not solely a revenue act. Respondent
strongly urges that it must be treated as primarily for the
purpose of increasing federal income, and that therefore
there should be no judicial deduction that the incidental

U. S. 27." While there has long been recognition of the
authority of Congress to obtain incidental social, health or
economic advantages from the exercise of constitutional
powers," it has been said that such collateral results must
be obtained from statutory provisions reasonably adapted
to the constitutional objects of the legislation. Linder v.
United States, 268 U. S. 5, 17. But here the respondent's
contention is inapplicable because the regulatory provisions in controversy are authorized by the Commerce

Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381;
United States v. Darby, supra, 119.
Further, we agree with respondent's contention that
-there is no authority to confiscate or destroy materials under the renovated butter act. It should be noted that
packing stock adulterated under the definitions of § 402
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1046,
when introduced into or while in interstate commerce may
be confiscated under § 304 while in interstate commerce or
at any time thereafter. Cf. United States v. Nine Barrels
of Butter, 241 F. 499. Petitioner argues that the provisions for meat inspection, made applicable to process and
renovated butter factories by I. R. C. § 2327, note 10,

Section 72 does authorize the destruction of unfit carcasses of cattle, hogs and sheep intended for human consumption, and we assume, if applicable, would authorize
a similar destruction of the materials intended for butter

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

315 U. S.

But, as we have seen, the Secretary of Agriculture of the
United States cannot condemn the packing stock butter.
The Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries of Alabama claims authority under the state statute to condemn packing stock butter held for renovation.' Does
the state's claim interfere or conflict with the federal
power?
On the face of the statutes a solution of the conflict
.might be reached on the ground that the state statute
authorizes condemnation only when the packing stock
butter is held for sale "within the state" in its then condition. Such a suggestion does not meet the issue, however.
The bill alleges, and the motion to dismiss and stipulation
admit, the seizure of a kind of raw material none of which,
either that seized or used, had ever been so held or offered
for sale in packing stock condition.
We lay aside also, as inapplicable, the suggestion that
the highest court of Alabama, in State v. Cecil, 216 Ala.
391, 113 So. 254, held that the Agricultural Code of that
state was not intended to cover goods in interstate commerce, and that, therefore, since these materials are in
interstate commerce, they are beyond the scope of the
Alabama Code. The opinion in the Cecil case dealt with
a different section, one relating to licensing farm product
commission merchants. The defendant was engaged in
interstate business only. For that section the decision of
the Alabama court is final. It did not consider the section
here under examination, and in our view, which, of course,
is not controlling on Alabama courts, § 495 in the absence
of conflict or interference with a specific federal act would
be effective to condemn goods held in Alabama under the
terms of the section, even though the goods were commingled with a mass, some of which would be ultimately

exported from the state. State power over food supplies
held within its borders would extend at least so far. Sligh
v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S. 52. On the other hand, federal
control over interstate commerce would, if it is exercised,
extend over that portion of the material which would
ultimately be sold in Alabama as renovated butter. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 399; Currin v. Wallace,
306 U. S. 1, 11; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., 307
U. S. 533, 568; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 122.
But, of course, if any of the finished product is offered for
sale in Alabama, such product becomes immediately subject to the requirements of the pure food laws of that
state.
Coming finally to the query whether the state's claim
interferes or conflicts with the purpose or provisions of
the federal legislation, we determine that it does. The
manufacture and distribution in interstate and foreign
commerce of process and renovated butter is a substantial
industry which, because of its multi-state activity, cannot
be effectively regulated by isolated competing states. Cf.
Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 TT. S. 548, 588; United
States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 122. Its wholesome and
successful functioning touches farm producers and city
consumers. Science made possible the utilization of
large quantities of packing stock butter which fell below
the standards of public demand 21 and Congress underThe annual report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the
year ending June 30, 1903, shows that, during the first fiscal year

took to regulate the production in order that the resulting
commodity might be free of ingredients deleterious to
health. It left the states free to act on the packing stock
supplies prior to the time of their delivery. into the hands
of the manufacturer and to regulate sales of the finished
product within their borders. But, once the material was
definitely marked for commerce by acquisition of the
manufacturer, it passed into the domain of federal
control.
Inspection of the factory and of the material was provided for explicitly. Confiscation of the finished product
was authorized upon a finding of its unsuitability for food
through Cie use of unhealthful or unwholesome materials,
a finding that might be based upon visual or delicate laboratory tests, or upon observation of the use of such
materials in the process of manufacture. I. R. C. § 2325;

9 C. F. R. § § 301.41-43. By the statutes and regulations,
the Department of Agriculture has authority to watch the
consumer's interest throughout the process of manufacture and distribution. It sees to the sanitation of the
factories in such minutiae as the clean hands of the employees and the elimination of objectionable odors, inspects the materials used, including air for aerating the
oils, and confiscates the finished product when materials
which would be unwholesome if utilized are present after
manufacture." Confiscation by the state of material in
production nullifies federal discretion over ingredients.

Opinion of the Court.*

It is said that the state and the United States have
worked coperatively in protecting consumers from vicious
practices in the handling of processed butter; that any
action by the state aids the policy of both in disposing of
unfit food; and that therefore a -harmonious federal-state
relationship should not be hampered. Our duty to deal
with contradictory functions of state and nation, on any
occasion, and particularly when one or the other is challenged by private interests, calls for the utmost effort to
avoid conclusions which interfere with the governmental
operations of either. Nothing could be more fertile for
discord, however, than a failure to define the boundaries
of authority. Clashes may and should be minimized by
mutual tolerance; but they are much less likely to happen
when each knows the limits of its responsibility. And,
it is only reasonable to assume that the theory of denying
inconsistent powers to a state is based largely upon the
benefits to the regulated industry of freedom from inconsistencies.
Congress hardly intended the intrusion of another authority during the very preparation of a commodity subject to the surveillance and comprehensive specifications of the Department of Agriculture. To uphold the
power of the State of Alabama to condemn the material
in the factory, while it was under federal observation
and while federal enforcement deemed it wholesome,
would not only hamper the administration of the federal
act but would be inconsistent with its requirements.
Whether the sanction used to enforce the regulation is
condemnation of the material or the product is not significant. Since there was federal regulation of the materials and composition of the manufactured article, there
could not be similar state regulation of the same

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE:

I think the judgment should be affirmed.
The decision of the Court appears to me to depart radically from the salutary principle that Congress, in enacting legislation within its constitutiohal authority, will not
be deemed to have intended to strike down a state statute
designed to protect the health and safety of the public
unless the state act, in terms or in its practical administration, conflicts with the act of Congress or plainly and palpably infringes its policy. Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How.

cf. Maurer v. Hamilton, 309 U. S. 598, 614.
We have here no question of an unexercised discretionary power given by Congress to a federal official as the
means of regulating interstate commerce, where the full
exercise of his authority would conflict with an assertion
of the state power. In such circumstances the state's
authority to act turns upon the question, which this Court
has often been called upon to answer, whether the failure
of the federal official to exercise his full power is in effect
a controlling administrative ruling that no further regulation by either federal or state government is needful.

STONn, C. J., dissenting.

Here, concededly the Secretary is exercising all the authority he has. His authority under 32 Stat. 196, 26 U. S.
C. § 2325, to seize and condemn is restricted to the manufactured product, "renovated butter." It does not extend
to "packing stock butter" intended to be used in making
the product. But as construed by the Court the act has
deprived Alabama of the power which it would otherwise
possess to seize spoiled packing stock butter, without conferring that authority on any federal officer. Thus both
the federal and the state governments are left powerless to
condemn an article which is a notorious menace to health,'
a substantial part of which is never shipped out of the
state. A congressional purpose to immunize from regulation, state and national, a substance so obviously requiring
control is not lightly to be inferred, especially where public health or safety is concerned. Mintz v. Baldwin, supra,
350; Kelly v. Washington, supra, 14; Welch Co. v. New
Hampshire,supra, 85.
The Secretary is also given authority by the federal act
to inspect the place, and process of manufacturing renovated butter, the ingredients going into it, and the renovated product itself, which he may confiscate if he finds it
to be deleterious to health. But his authority over packing stock butter before it is used for manufacture is restricted to its inspection. The inspection thus affords a
means of determining whet:=er the manufactured product
in which packing stock is used, and which the Secretary
may seize, contains a deleterious ingredient, the presence
'A report of August 25, 1933, p. 3, by a member of the staff of the

renovated butter: (A) 37 fly maggots, 7 rodent hairs, 1 feather, cinders and sand; (B) 4 fly maggots, 1 fly, 2 ants, 1 cow hair, 1 human hair,
grass and sawdust; (C) 1 fly maggot, 11 brown ants, 1 human hair, 1

of which in the product can often be ascertained, if at all,
only by delicate chemical tests.'
The legislative history of the federal act shows, what is
evident from its words, that its aim is to use the federal
power to prevent, by seizure and condemnation, the interstate distribution of renovated butter when found unfit for
food. 35 Cong. Rec. 3316,4586. The grant of authority to
the Secretary to inspect the ingredients and seize the product gives no indication of a congressional purpose to
hamper state control over the contaminated materials before their manufacture into the finished product. Indeed,
Congress not only confined the Secretary's authority to
make seizures to the renovated product, but in assuming
this control it was at pains to provide by 32 Stat. 193, 21
U. S.C. § 25, that the states should be free to exert their
police power over the renovated material "in the same
manner as though" it "had been produced in such State or
Territory."' The sponsor in the Senate of the bill containing this provision emphasized that it was not intended to
restrict the power of the states, hut rather to expand their
authority to include original packages in interstate commerce. 35 Cong. Rec. 3605. In the face of these disavowals with respect to the finished product which Congress brought under federal authority, one can hardly infer
a congressional purpose to restrict the states' power over
the ingredient which Congress did not seek to control; or
that Congress could have had any object in denying the
states power to seize the offensive ingredient. when it left
them free to seize the product because it contained the
ingredient.
Moreover, not only is there a complete want of conflict
between the two statutes and their administration, but
it seems plain that the Alabama statute, both by its terms
and in its practical administration, aids and supplements

the federal regulation and policy. Consequently there
is no room for any inference that Congress, by its enactment, sought to stay the hands of the state in the exercise
of a power with which the federal act does not conflict.
The basic and identical concern of both governments is
to protect the consuming public from contaminated butter.
If the state seizes unfit packing stock, the federal authorities are relieved of the necessity of detecting it and
of seizing the renovated product which it contaminates."
In exercising the powers conferred on him by the Act, the
Secretary is not concerned with the quality of packing
stock save as it is used in making renovated butter.
Seizure of it by the state at the same time removes all
necessity and duty of federal inspection, since, in any
'The Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Dairy Industry, in a letter to
the Solicitor for the Department, July 22, 1941, which accompanied
a proposed bill to give the department authority to condemn filthy
ingredients going into renovated butter, said:
"It is axiomatic that despite the processes through which butter or
butter oil pass during the course of manufacturing renovated butter,
certain soluble materials unfit for human consumption cannot be
removed and it is difficult if not impossible to detect them in the
finished product. For example, a lot of butter may be infested with
maggots and should be condemned for use in the manufacture of renovated butter. If not, in the melting process fat from these maggots
will be mixed with the butter fat and the animal fat may be detected
in the finished product only by chemical laboratory tests, if at all."
A representative of the Department, appearing at the House Committee Hearings on the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1913, noted another difficulty in locating contaminated renovated butter:
"But if 500 pounds of rotten packing stock is in a factory, maybe
there is 10,000 pounds of other packing stock there; and you can
understand how impossible it is for us to follow through that packing
stock so as to be able to identify it when it comes out of the factory and
is offered for sale."

event, it will never become an ingredient of renovated
butter.
The opinion, while recognizing that the Department has
long taken the view that it has no power to seize packing
stock butter, disregards administrative actualities in assuming that state seizure of it would involve an "intrusion" into the federal domain, which would "hamper the
administration of the federal act." The record of administration is not one of belligerency and jurisdictional jealousy, but of active and sympathetic co6peration between
state and federal agencies in effecting a common purpose,
prevention of the consumption of unfit butter, whether
that objective is accomplished by state seizure of the packing stock or federal condemnation of the renovated product.4 To find in such circumstances an intent to restrict
' The Memorandum of the Chief of The Bureauof Dairy Industry to
the Solicitor of The Department of Agriculture, October 4, " 40, states
in part: "The development and perfection during the past feN, years of
new methods for analyzing and examining butter has resulted in increased regulatory activity and action against farm-made or. 'packing
stock' butter intended for use in the manufacture of process or renovated butter. Certain State regulatory agencies and the Federal Food
and Drug Administration have been particularly active.
"The Bureau of Dairy Industry, which is the administrative agency
designated by the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the process or
renovated butter act, is entirely sympathetic with the activities of
these agencies, although the apparently limiting provisions of Section
5 of the Act of May 9, 1902 (32 Stat. 196), with which this Bureau is
primarily concerned, as construed in opinions of your office, have necessarily governed and guided this Bureau in its administrative policy in
carrying out the provisions of the Act."

Industry, 1940, the Officer in Charge of Dairy Products Inspection
reported, p. 4: "In conducting the inspection of all process or renovated butter factories, this office has maintained close contact with

possible cooperative action for improvement of conditions have been

state power, not required by the words of the statute, is to
condemn a working, harmonious federal-state relationship
for the sake of a sterile and harmful insistence on exclusive
federal power.
The controlling elements in this case seem identical
with those in the application of the Pure Food and Drugs
Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 768, which this Court has held imposes no restriction on state action which supplements
the federal act and does not conflict with its terms or
practical administration. In sustainifig local regulations
requiring the labels placed cn animal foodstuffs to disclose
their ingredients, in addition to the truthful description
of the product demanded by the federal act, this Court
said: "The requirements, the enforcement of which the
bill seeks to enjoin, are not in any way in conflict with the
provisions of the Federal act. They may be sustained
without impairing in the slightest degree its operation
and effect. There is no question here of conflicting
standards or of opposition of state to Federal authority."
Savage v. Jones, supra, 225 U. S. at 539. State regulation
yields only when it is in conflict with the administration
or terms of the Pure Food and Drugs Act. Cf. McDermott
V. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115. The same view has been
taken in other cases where state and federal governments
South has been beneficial in improving the procurement methods used
in getting packing stock butter to the factories. More frequent pickups
have been inaugurated and both Atlanta and Birmingham factories
have expended hundreds of dollars in new specially made cans with
tight fitting covers, and the packing stock received is very much
cleaner." Id., 1938, p. 2: "Much of the credit for improvement in
quality of packing stock butter belongs to State and Federal regulatory
agencies cooperating in campaigns to improve procurement practices."

U. S. 1. Such should be our construction of the Renovated
Butter Act. It seems ironical for us to say that although
state seizures of petitioner's packing stock are not precluded by the judicial and administrative 5 construction
of the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which authorizes federal
confiscation of the filthy ingredient, petitioner has nevertheless discovered an avenue of escape by appeal to the
Renovated Butter Act which does not authorize federal
seizure of the ingredient.
It is one thing for courts in interpreting an Act of Congress regulating matters beyond state control to construe
its language with a view to carrying into effect a general
though unexpressed congressional purpose. It is quite
another to infer a purpose,, which Congress has not expressed, to deprive the states of authority which otherwise
constitutionally belongs to them, over a subject which
Congress has not undertaken to control. Due regard
A report by the officer in charge of the Cereal and Dairy Section,
Food Division, of the Food and Drug Administration, to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, on January 20, 1942, discloses that between
July 1, 1933 and January 1, 1942, thirty-six seizures were made of lots
of packing stock butter consigned to process butter plants. In commenting upon the extent of state cobperation in such seizures, it was
noted that in twenty-one of such cases the packing stock was detained
by the state authorities pending the filing by federal officials of a libel
for condemnation proceedings under the Pure Food and Drugs Act,
21 U. S. C. § 334. These seizures included four lots of packing stock
totaling over 5,000 pounds shipped to petitioner, and detained by the
Alabama authorities until condemnation proceedings were begun in the
federal court.

MR. JUSTICE

FRANKFURTER:

I agree entirely with the opinion of the CHIEF JUSTICE.
I shall add only a few words on the general bearing of the
majority opinion upon the legislative process.
From the very beginning of our government in 1789,
federal legislation like that now under review has usually
not only been sponsored but actually drafted by the appropriate executive agency. This was true of the Act of
August 10, 1912, 37 Stat. 273, amending the Renovated

Butter Act. The Department of Agriculture not only
urged the enactment of the legislation upon Congress, it
drafted its provisions. If the Department wanted Congress to withdraw from the states their power to condemn
unsanitary packing stock and to confide such power in
the federal government, it could easily have made appro.

priate provision in the draft submitted by it to Congress.
However, the Department did not do so. It did ask Congress to make some restrictions upon the authority which

had been exercised by the states in r~gulating the manufac-

ture and sale of butter for the protection of their citizens.
But the restrictions did not include withdrawal from
the states of the power to condemn Unhealthful packing
stock butter. The sponsors of this legislation, the experts
of the Department of Agriculture, could. have submitted
to Congress appropriate language for the accomplishment of that result. They did not do so. The Court
now does it for them even though the Department has
no such desire.
To require the various agencies of the government who
are the effective authors of legislation like that now before
us to express clearly and explicitly their purpose in dislodging constitutional powers of states-if such is their
purpose-makes for care in draftsmanship and for responsibility in legislation. To hold, as do the majority,
that paralysis of state power is somehow to be found in
the vague implications of the federal renovated butter
enactments, is to encourage slipshodness in draftsmanship
and irresponsibility in legislation.
The majority opinion points out that the successive
Solicitors of the Department of Agriculture have uniformly been of the opinion that the Department lacks the
power. to condemn or destroy unwholesome packing stock
butter. If the Department were not content to have the
states continue to exercise that power, it would have gone
to Congress. In these circumstances it is strange to find
in this legislation a denial to the states of powers which the
Department has disclaimed and to the exercise of which
by the states it has never objected.
The result of this decision is to deny Alabama the power
to protect the health of its citizens without replacing such
protection by that of the federal government. The CHIEF
JUSTICE does well to call attention to the fact that such a
construction of the Renovated Butter Act gratuitously
destroys the harmonious co~peration between the nation
and the states in safeguarding the health of our people. If

ever there was an intrusion by this Court into a field that
belongs to Congress, and which it has seen fit not to enter,
this is it. And what is worse, the decision is purely destructive legislation-the Court takes power away from
the states but is, of course, unable to transfer it to the
federal government.
HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. ALABAMA ASPHALTIC LIMESTONE CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 328. Argued January 15, 1942.-Decided February 2, 1942.
1. Pursuant to a plan of its creditors, an insolvent corporation was
adjudged bankrupt; its assets were sold by the bankruptcy trustee,
bid in by the creditors' committee, and acquired by a new corporation in exchange for its stock, all of which was issued to
creditors of the old corporation in satisfaction of their claims, the
old stockholders being eliminated. Non-assenting minority creditors were paid in cash. Operations were not interrupted by the
reorganization and were carried on subsequently by substantially
the same persons as before. Held:
(1) A "reorganization" within the meaning of § 112 (i) (1) of
the Revenue Act of 1928; so that, in computing depreciation and
depletion for the year 1934, the assets of the new corporation, so
acquired, had the same basis that they had when owned by the
old corporation. Pp. 181, 183.
(2) The continuity of interest test was satisfied since the creditors had effective command over the disposition of the property
from the time when they took steps to enforce their demands
against their insolvent debtor by the institution of bankruptcy
proceedings. At that time they stepped into the shoes of the old
stockholders. P. 183.
(3) The transaction here met the statutory standard of a "reorganization" even though at the time of acquisition by the new
corporation the property belonged to the committee and not to the
old corporation, since the acquisition by the committee was an
integrated part of a single reorganization plan. P. 184.
