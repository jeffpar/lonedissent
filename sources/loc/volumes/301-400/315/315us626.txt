SPRECKELS v. COMMISSIONER OF
INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 581 and 582. Argued March 4, 5, 1942.-Decided
March 16, 1942.

Sales commissions paid by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying and selling securities on his own account are not deductible
as ordinary and necessary expenses, under ยง 23 (a) of the Revenue
Act of 1934, but are to be treated as offsets against selling price
relevant only to the determination of capital losses or gains.

P. 627.
In Art. 282 of T. R. 77, under the Revenue Act of 1932, and
Art. 24-2 of T. R. 86, under the Revenue Act of 1934, providing
that commissions paid in selling securities are an offset against
the selling price "when such commissions are not an ordinary and
necessary business expense," the qualifying clause is controlling

only in the case of dealers in securities.

MR. JuSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
During 1934 and 1935, the petitioner bought and sold
stocks, bonds, and commodities. In connection with the
sales, he paid selling commissions to brokers, and in his
books these commissions were deducted from selling price
before net profit or loss was determined. In his income
tax returns for 1934 and 1935, he treated the commissions

similarly, not making deductions for them as ordinary
and necessary business expenses. In 1939, however, in
the course of proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals,'
the petitioner asserted that he was entitled to tax-refunds,
for the reason that his failure to make deductions for the
commissions had resulted in overpayment in both years.
The Board sustained his contention in part, holding that
the selling commissions could properly have been deducted
as ordinary and necessary business expenses, that the refund claimed for 1935 should be allowed, but that the refund claimed for 1934 was barred by the applicable statute
of limitations. 41 B. T. A. 1204. The Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed, holding that the claimed deductions for
selling commissions were not permissible, and finding it
unnecessary therefore to determine whether the refund
claim for 1934 was timely. 119 F. 2d 667. Because of a
conflict in decisions of Circuit Courts of Appeal,2 we
granted certiorari to consider the question: Are sales commissions, paid by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying and selling securities,' deductible as ordinary and
necessary expenses under ยง 23 (a) of the Revenue Act of
1934,' or are they to be treated as offsets against selling

not relevant here.

(C.C.A. 2), and Neubergerv. Commissioner,104 F. 2d 649 (C.C.A. 2).
'Although the petitioner alleges that some of the commissions were
paid on sales of commodities, it does not appear from the record that
the petitioner asked for separate treatment of these commissions before
either the Board of Tax Appeals or the Circuit Court of Appeals. Nor
was such separate treatment requested before this Court.

price, relevant only to the determination of capital losses
or gains?
In Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, we held that a
taxpayer who bought and sold securities could not deduct
the commissions paid on his purchases as a business expense. Although the Winmill case arose under the Revenue Act of 1932, the statutory provisions and regulations
there relevant are identical with those again in controversy here. And the conclusion we reached there-that
a general regulation I designating "commissions" as one
of a long list of deductible business expenses is not controlling in the face of a specific regulation pertaining to
commissions on securities transactions-is equally applicable here.
The specific regulation pertaining to securities transactions provides:
"Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part
of the cost price of such securities. Commissions paid in
selling securities, when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense, are an offset against
the selling -price.

If there is any justification for treating sales commissions
differently from purchase commissions, it must depend
upon the significance of the clause "when such commissions
are - not an ordinary and necessary business expense."
This clause first appeared in Treasury Regulations 77,
accompanying the Revenue Act of 1932. In the income
tax regulations prior to that time, it was consistently prescribed that commissions paid on purchases and sales of
"Among the items included in business expenses are .. .commis-

sions

--Treasury Regulations 77, under the Revenue Act of 1932; Article
23(a)-1 of Treasury Regulations 86, under the Revenue Act of 1934.

1932; Article 24-2 of Regulations 86, under the Revenue Act of 1934.

securities were to be treated as part of the cost or selling
price 'and were not otherwise to be deductible
And in
Helvering v. Union Pacific Co., 293 U. S. 282, 286, this
Court expressly recognized that such commissions have
been "consistently treated . . *. not as items of current
expense, but as additions to the cost of the property or
deductions from the proceeds of sale."
What, then, is the significance of the qualifying clause
first appearing in the Regulations of 1932, and what effect
is to be given to it? Prior to the formal adoption of the
Regulations of 1932, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue permitted one exception to what appears to have been
an otherwise uniform practise of treating gommissions on
the sales of securities as mere offsets agairist selling price.
This exception was made in the case of the dealer in securities, one who "as a merchant buys securities and sells
them to customers with a view to the gains and profits,
that may be derived therefrom." ' It reflects the view that
there are practical considerations of accounting convenience which make it as difficult for such dealers, in many
instances, to set commissions off against the proceeds of
individufal sales as it would be for the merchant of other
wares to treat his selling expenses only as a series of subtractions from the selling price realized on particular
items of his stock.' Incorporation of the clause "when
such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense" was intended to provide formal recognition
for an established business usage, based on the peculiar
'See, e. g., Article 8, par. 10 of Treasury Regulations 33, Revised,

Act of 1934.

necessities of securities dealers, a usage to which the Commissioner had already given informal acquiescence'." For
the casual buyer and seller of securities, or even for the
large scale trader on his own account, as here, the practical
obstacles to treating sales commissions as offsets against
selling price do not exist. In this very case, for example,
the taxpayer apparently found it more convenient to follow this method in keeping his own business records.
We therefore conclude that the clause "when such commissions are not an ordinary and necessary business expense" was intended to be and is controlling only in the
case of securities dealers.11 In the case of a trader on his
own account where there are no compelling practical
grounds for treating sales commissions as such an expense,
we find no persuasive reason for distinguishing, under the
statute and regulations, between sales commissions like
those before us and purchase commissions like those of the
Winmill case. . The judgment of the court below is
accordingly
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration

or decision of this case.

'As the Government points out in its brief, a dealer's tax liability
under the Revenue Acts of 1932 and 1934 would ordinarily have been
the same whether the commiscions he paid on sales were treated as
deductible " isiness expenses or offsets against selling price. For in
general, his gains or losses would not have been capital gains or losses
as defined in those acts. See ยง 101 (c) (8) of the Revenue Act of
1932, 47 Stat. 169, 192; ยง 117 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48
Stat. 680, 714.
