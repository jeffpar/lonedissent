F. H. E. OIL CO. v. HELVERING, COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 26. Argued October 9, 10, 1939.-Decided November 6, 1939.
A reguiation under the Revenue Act of 1932, requiring that development as well as operative expenses be deducted from gross income
from oil wells, in ascertaining "net income from the property"
under § 114 (b) (3), sustained, upon the authority of Helvering
v. Wilshire Oil Co., ante, p. 90.
'102 F. 2d 596, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 307 U. S. 618, to review a judgment of
the court below which reversed a decision of the Board
of Tax Appeals (36 B. T. A. 1327), reducing a deficiency
assessment.

Mr. Harry C. Weeks for petitioner.
Mr. Arnold Raum, with whom Soliitor General Jackson, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and Messrs. Sewall
Key and Ellis N. Slack were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This case presents the same issue as is involved in Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., ante, p. 90, except that it arises
under the Revenue Act of 1932 (47 Stat. 169). In computing its taxable net income under that Act, petitioner
deducted certain development expenditures as it had done
since its organization in 1925. But it refused to take
these same deductions in computing net income for the
purpose of applying the 50 per cent limitation on the
depletion allowance, as provided in §,114 (b) (3) of the

F. H. E. OIL CO. v. HELVERING.

Opinion of the Court.

1932 Act. 1 That section, so far as material here, was
the same as § 114 (b) (3) of the 1928 Act (45 Stat. 791).
And Treasury Regulations 77, Art. 221 (h) promulgated
under the 1932 Act 2 defined "net income . . . from the
property" as used in §.114 (b) (3) so as to require "development costs" of the kind here involved to be deducted
from "gross income from the property." ' The Board of
Tax Appeals held that petitioner need not deduct these
That section provided:

"In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be
271/2 per centum of the gross income from the property during the
taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount. equal to
any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of
the property. Such aflowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the
net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for deple-"
tion) from the property, except that in no case shall the depletion
allowance be less than it would be if computed without reference to
this paragraph."
' Section 23 (1) of the Revenue Act of 1932 provided:
"In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:
"(1) Dcpletion.-In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for'
depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in
each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under
rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the
approval of the Secretary ... "
'Treasury Regulations 77, Art. 221 (h) provided:
"'Net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for
depletion) from the property,' as used in section 114 (b) (2), (3), and
(4) and articles 221 to 248, inclusive, means the 'gross income from
the property' as defined in paragraph "(g) less the allowable deductions
attributable to the mineral property upon which the depletion is
claimed and the allowable deductidns attributable to the processes
listed in paragraph (g) in so far as they relate to the product of such
property, including overhead and operating expenses, development
costs properly charged td expense, depreciation, taxes, losses sustaiied,
etc., but excluding any allowance for depletion. . ."

Syllabus.

308 U. S.

development expenditures in applying the 50 per cent
limitation on depletion allowance (36 B. T. A. 1327) and
the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (102 F. 2d 596).
Since we have this day decided in Helvering v. Wilshire
Oil Co., supra, that comparable regulations under the
1928 Act were lawful, a fortiori those here involved are
valid and binding on petitioner. The judgment of the
court below was therefore right and is
Affirmed.

v. LOS ANGELES LUMBER PRODUCTS
CO., LTD.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 23 *and 24. Argued October 18, 1939.-Decided
November 6, 1939.
1. The question whether a plan -of reorganization is "fair and
equitable" within the meaning of § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act is
a question of law. P. 114.
2. Where a plan of reorganization'is not fair and equitable as a matter
of law, it can not be approved by the court even though the
percentage of the various classes of security holders required by
§ 77B (f) for confirmation of a plan has consented. Id.
3. The fact that a great majority of the security holders have approved the plan is not the test of whether the plan is a fair and
equitable one. Id.
4. Under § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, as in equity reorganizations,
the court must use its own informed and independent judgment in
every important determination in the administration of the
proceedings. 'P.115.
5. Where words are employed in an Act which had at the tim'e a
well known meaning in the law, they are used in that sense unless
the context requires the contrary. Id.
6. It is a fixed principle, governing under § 77B of the Bankruptcy
Act as well as in eauitv reorganizations, that, to the extent of their
