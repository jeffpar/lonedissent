BRUNO v. UNITED STATES.

Statement of the Case.

"an incidental consequence" of the building of the setback levee!' Nor can we conclude that a taking occurred
through the act of the Army officers in dynamiting the
levee during the emergency of the 1937 flood. It was
restored to its previous height. Up until this time, the
plan for a fuse-plug to permit the escape of destructive
flood waters was not in effect. Indeed, the petitioner
disclaims any contention that the crevassing of ti levee
by the Government was a taking. The taking, he urges,
took place before and this use is only evidence of the
control obtained by the prior taking.
Reversed in part and affirmed in part.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 300. Argued November 6, 1939.-Decided December 4, 1939.
1. Under the Act of March 16, 1878, the accused in'a criminal case
in the federal court is entitled, upon request, to have the jury
instructed, in substance, that his failure to avail himself of the
privilege of testifying does not create any presumption against
him and must not be permitted by the jury to weigh against him.
P. 292.
2. Refusal to grant such an instruction is not a "technical error" to
be disregarded upon review or motion for new trial, within the
meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 391. P. 293.
105 F. 2d 921, reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Argument for Petitioner

308 U. S.

Mr. Samuel B. Wasserman, with whom Mr. M. Michael
Edelstein was on the brief, for petitioner.
The requested charge should have been granted by the
trial court.
Such a charge is mandatory under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and 28
U. S. Code § 632.
At common law, a defendant could not be compelled to
give evidence against himself. The Fifth Amendment
incorporated this rule into the Constitution. McKnight
v. United States, 115 F. 972, 981, 982.
Had the statute not specifically provided that no presumption arises from non-exercise of the privilege to testify, the constitutional provision would have implied as
much, so that silent defendants might be protected from
any hostile comment.
If everybody believes that a person failing to take the
stand is actuated by fear, then the privilege of testifying
creates a presumption which extinguishes the constitutional protection of the Fifth.Amendment. Section 632
has been in existence so long that jurors today know that
a defendant may testify, but do not know of the constitutional protection provided by the rule against selfincrimination. Obviously, the only way to make the defendant's rights known to the jury is by a clear, correct
statement of the applicable law. If the eyes of the jury
see the taint of guilt on every defendant who remains
silent, then the necessity of a charge such as that requested, is conclusively established. See, 4 Wigmore on
Evidence, pp. 811, 814, 815; Stout v. United States, 227
F. 799; Michael v. United States, 7 F. 2d 865; Hersh v.

F. Kneip, Fred E. Strine, and W. Marvin Smith were on

The requested instruction was properly refused. Wilson v. United States, 149 U. S. 60; Reagan v. United
States, 157 U. S. 301, 304-305; McKnight v. United
States, 115 F. 972, 981-983; Swenzel v.United States, 22
F. 2d 280; Stout v. United States, 227 F. 799, 803;
Michael v. United States, 7 F. 2d 865.
In several States .the statutes have been construed as
forbidding all reference by the trial judge in his charge to
the silence of the accused. Times v. Commonwealth, 25
Ky. Law Rep. 1233; Hanks v. Commonwealth, 248 Ky.
203; State v. Pearce, 56 Minn. 226; State v. Long, 324 Mo.

State, 88 Tex. Cr. 29; Kinney v. State, 36 Wyo. 466; cf.,
State v. Ford, 109 Conn. 490; Tucker v. State, 29 Ga.
App. 221.
In approximately 42 States there exist statutes prohibiting any inference to be drawn from an accused's
failure to testify. See, Wigmore on Evidence, 2d ed.,
§ 488, Note 2. These statutes provide either (1) that
the failure of the defendant to testify shall not create
any presumption against him, (2) that such failure shall
not be the subject of comment by counsel or by either
court or counsel, or (3) .contain both such provisions.
See, 31 Mich. L. Rev. 40-43; Wigmore on Evidence,
1934 Supp. § 2272, Note 2. In Indiana (Burns Ann.
Stat. 1926, § 2267), Nevada (Rev. Laws 1912, .§7161),
and Washington (Comp. St. 1922, § 2148), the statutes
specifically require the trial judge, upon request, to
instruct the jury in accordance with the statute.
In England, the Criminal Evidence Act of 1898, § 1
(St. 61 & 62, Vict. c. 36), provides that the acecsed's
failure to give evidence "shall not be made tho subject of
any comment by the prosecution." But the judge. is not
Drevented from commenting thereon. R. v. Rhodes, 1 Q.

Argument for thie United States.

B. 77, 83 (1899); cf., The King v. Parker, 1 K. B. 850
(1933).
Several state courts, construing their statutes, have held
that, upon request, it is proper for the court to instruct
the jury as to the defendant's silence, and that the refusal to do so is error, Cox v. State, 173 Ark. 1115; People
v. Greben, 352 Ill. 582; State v. Landry, 85 Me. 95; People
v. Provost, 144 Mich. 17; Funches v. State, 125 Miss. 140;
State v. Walker, 94 W. Va. 691. But the failure to instruct, without request, is not error. Bradley v. State, 35
Ariz. 420; People v. Mitsunaga, 91 Cal. App. 298; State
v. Williams, 90 Conn. 126; State v. Reid, 200 Iowa 892;
State v. Younger, 70 Kan. 226; State v. Lesh, 27 N. D.
165; Bosley v. State, 69 Tex. Cr. 100; State v. Comer,
176 Wash. 257.
The jury will, despite instruction, draw an adverse inference from the accused's failure to testify. See, 31
Mich. L. R. 226, 229; Michael v. United States, supra;
Wigmore on Evidence, 2d Ed., § 2272, p. 901. A fortiori
if they ate reminded by an instruction that he may testify.
Consequently, refusal to instruct does not adversely affect
his substantial rights.
The statute" is primarily intended to prevent the use
of accused's failure to testify as an inference of guilt
by prohibiting both court .and prosecutor from commpenting, in the presence of the jury, on that fact. The
accused is only protected from having the fact of his
silence being used, to his prejudice, as evidence of his
guilt, in violation of his right to be silent until his guilt
is established beyond a reasonable doubt. There is
.nothing in the statute .which - protects him from an unfavorable -inference Which- the jury might naturally draw
from the exercise of his privilege to remain silent.
Nor is there any merit in the petitioner's assertion that
the constitutional privilege of an accused not to be com-

Opinion of the Court.

pelled to be a witness against himself (Fifth Amendment) requires the giving of the instruction requested in
the instant case.
Mere self-incrimination is not prohibited by the Fifth
Amendment. It is only when that incrimination becomes compulsory that the proscription of the Constitution becomes applicable. , Since, under the statute, "it
is a matter of choice whether he [the accused] become a
witness or not," (Reagan v. United States, 157 U. S. 301,
305) his failure to exercise such choice cannot be said to
involve such compulsory self-incrimination as to require
an instruction that no inference shall result because of the
accused's election not to testify.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
In affirming the conviction of Jerry Bruno, who, with
eighty-seven others, was convicted of a conspiracy to
violate the narcotic laws, the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit, dealt with an important question in
the administration of federal criminal justice in such a
way as to lead us to grant certiorari.
Some of Bruno's co-defendants took the witness-stand.
He did not. The trial court gave the following instructions to the jury regarding the attitude to be observed by
them towards the accused as a witness:
"It is the privilege of a defendant to testify as a witness if, and only when, he so elects; and when he does
testify his credibility is to be determined in the light of
his interest, which usually is greater than that of any
other witness, and is therefore a matter which may
seriously affect the credence that shall be given to his
testimony."

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Opinion of the Court.

308 U. S.

Bruno requested this additional instruction:
"The failure of any defendant to take the witness stand
and testify in his own behalf, does not create any presumption against him; the jury is charged that it must
not permit that fact to weigh in 'the slightest degree
against any such defendant, nor shoold this fact enter
into the discussions or deliberations of the jury in any
manner."
The trial judge declined this request, saying "I feel that
I've already covered that." The exception to this denial
having been saved, the Circuit Court of Appeals found
no error in the refusal, although confessing that the guidknce which had been given the jury "was not the equivalent, of what the defendant had requested," Bruno v.
United States, 105 F. 2d 921. By this, we take it, the
court below meant that the topic on which Bruno proffered an instruction had not been charged at all.
Therefore, the narrow question before us is whether
in these circumstances Bruno had the indefeasible right
to have the -jury told in substance what he asked the judge
to tell it. The issue is determined by a proper application of the Act of March 16, 1878, 20 Stat. 30, now 28
U. S. C. § 632."
That Act freed the accused in a federal prosecution
from his common law disability as a witness. But Congress cou pled his privilege to be a witness with the right
to have a failure to exercise the privilege not tell against
him. The accused could "at his own request but not
'Section 632: "In the trial of all indictments, informations, complaints, and other proceedings against persons charged with the commission of crimes, offenses, and misdemeanors, in the United States
courts, Territorial courts, and courts martial, and courts of inquiry, in
any State or Territory, including the District of Columbia, the person
so charged shall, at his own request but not otherwise, be a competent
witness. And his failure to make such request shall not create any

BRUNO v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

otherwise be a competent witness. And his failure to
make such a request shall not create any presumption
against him." Such was the command of the law-makers.
The only way Congress could provide that abstention from
testifying should not tell against an accused was by an
implied direction to judges to exercise their traditional
duty in guiding the jury by indicating the considerations
relevant to the latter's- verdict on the facts. Sparf v.
United States, 156 U. S. 51. By legislating against the
creation of any "presumption" from a failure to testify,
Congress could not have meant to legislate against the
psychological operation of the jury's mind. It laid down
canons of judicial administration for the trial judge to
the extent that his instructions to .the jury, certainly
when appropriately invoked, might affect the behavior
of jurors. Concededly the charge requested by Bruno
was correct. The Act of March 16, 1878, gave him the
right to invoke it.
A subsidiary question remains for determination. It
derives from the Act of February 26, 1919, 40 Stat. 1181,
28 U. S. C. § 391, whereby appellate courts are under
duty in criminal as well as in civil cases to disregard "technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect
the substantial rights of the parties." Is the disregard
of the right which Congress gave to Bruno an error, the
commission of which we may disregard? We hold not.
It would be idle to predetermine the scope of such a remedial provision as § 391 by anticipating the myriad
varieties of rulings made in trials and attempting an
'Section 391: "All United States courts shall have power to grant
new trials, in cases where there has been a trial by jury, for reasons for
which new trials have usually been granted in the courts of law. On
the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, or motion for a new trial, in any
case, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical
errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights

of the parties."

abstract, inclusive definition of "technical errors." Suffice it to indicate, what every student of the history
behind the Act of February 26, 1919, knows, that that
Act was intended to prevent matters concerned with the
mere etiquette of trials and with the formalities and
minutiae of procedure from touching the merits of a verdict. Of a very different order of importance is the right
of an accused to 'insist on a privilege which Congress has
given him.
To the suggestion that it benefits a defendant who fails
to take the stand not to have the attention of the jury
directed to that fact, it suffices to say that, however difficult it may be to exercise enlightened self-interest, the
accused should be allowed to make his own choice when
an Act of Congress authorizes him to choose. And when
it is urged that it is a psychological impossibility not to
have a presumption arise in the minds of jurors against
an accused who fails to testify, the short answer is that
Congress legislated on a contrary assumption and not
'without support in experience. It was for Congress to
decide whether what it deemed legally significant was
psychologically futile. Certainly, despite the vast accumulation of psychological data, we have not yet attained
that certitude about the human mind which would justify
us in disregarding the will of Congress by a dogmatic
assumption that jurors, if properly admonished, neither
could nor would heed the instructions of the trial court
that the failure of an accused to be a witness in his own
cause "shall not create any presumption against him."
We conclude that the substance of the denied request
should have been granted, and the judgment therefore
is
Reversed.
