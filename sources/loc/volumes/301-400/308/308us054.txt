missioner, 296 U. S. 344, 354. Here we have an added,
and we think conclusive reasoft for rejecting the earlier
practice and accepting the later. ,The earlier' because
in sharp conflict with our own decisions, as we have
already indicated, cannot be continued without the perpetuation of inconsistency and confusion comparable to
that of which the Government asks to be relieved by our
decision.
Affirmed.

RASQUIN, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE,
v. HUMPHREYS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 37. Argued October 19, 1939.-Decided November 6, 1939.
1. A gift in trust reserving power in the donor to change the beneficiaries other than himself is incomplete and not subject to be
taxed as a gift under the Revenue Act of 1932. Sanford v. Commissioner, ante, p. 39, followed. P. 55.
2. Article III of Treasury Regulation 79 (1933 ed.), under the Revenue Act of 1932, affords no'basis for modification of the above
construction of the statute; and the amendment of the regulation in
1936 is so plainly in conflict with the statute as to preclude its
application retroactively. Id.
101 F. 2d 1012, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 307 U. S. 619, to review the affirmance of
a judgment recovered from the Collector in an action to

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Sidney W. Davidson, with whom Mr. Allin H.
Pierce was on the brief, for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. Beverley R. Robinson, E. N.
Perkins, and Weston Vernon, Jr., filed a brief, as amici
curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Decision in this case turns on the question, differing
only in form from that this day decided in Sanford V.
Helvering, ante, p. 39, whether, in case of an inter vivos
transfer of property in trust, reserving to the donor
power to designate new beneficiaries other than himself,
the gift becomes complete at the time of the creation of
the trust and subject to the gift tax imposed by the
Revenue Act of 1932.
In December, 1934, respondent created a trust of personal property for his own benefit for life, with remainders over to specified classes of beneficiaries. By the
trust indenture he reserved to himself a power to change
the beneficiaries of the trust and to prescribe the conditions under which the new beneficiaries should take an
interest in the trust, but without any power to increase
his own beneficial interest in the trust property.
Respondent paid the gift tax assessed against him with
respect to the transfer of the remainder interests upon
creation of the trust, and brought the present suit in the
district court to recover the tax as illegally collected.
Judgment in his favor was affirmed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 101 F. 2d 1012, on
the authority of Hesslein v. Hoey, 91 F. 2d 954. We
granted certiorari, 307 U. S. 619, so that this case might
be considered with the Sanford case.
The gift tax, § 319 et seq. of the 1924 Act, so far as now
niaterial, reappeared in § 501 et seq. of the 1932 Act, 47
Stat. 169. Other pertinent provisions of the earlier act

Opinion of the Court.

308 U. S.

were reenacted without change of present moment in
§§ 501, 510, 801. The applicable estate tax provisions are
§ 302 (c) (d) of the 1926 Act, 44 Stat. 40, 71. Section 501
(c) of the 1932 Act added a new provision that transfers
in trust, with power of revocation in the donor, should be
taxed on relinquishment of the power. This was repealed by § 511 of the Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, because
Burnet v. Guggenheim, 288 U. S. 280, had declared that
such was the law without specific legislation. H. R. No.
704, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 40; Sen. Rep. No. 558, 73rd
Cong., 2d Sess., p. 50.
For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Sanford
case we conclude that the reserved power in the donor at
the time of the creation of the trust rendered the gift
incomplete and not subject to the gift tax. As pointed
6ut in our opinion in the Sanford case the Treasury regulation under the 1932 Act, Art. III, Regulation 79 (1933
edition), in force when the trust was created, affords no
basis for modification of our construction of the statute.
Whatever validity the amended regulation of 1936 may
have in its prospective operation, we think it is so plainly
in conflict with the sthtute as to preclude its application
retroactively so as to subject to tax such transfer as was
made by the creation of the trust in 1934. Cf. Helvering
v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 306 U. S. 110.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTIcE BUTLER took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
