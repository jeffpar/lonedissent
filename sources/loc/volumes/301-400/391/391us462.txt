391 U. S.

RABECK v. NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE TERM OF THE SUPREME COURT
OF NEW YORK, FIRST JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.

No. 611. Decided May 27, 1968.
Former ยง 484-i of the New York Penal Law, which prohibited the
sale of "magazines .

.

. which would appeal to the lust of persons

under the age of eighteen years or to their curiosity as to sex or
to the anatomical differences between the sexes," is unconstitutionally vague and it is no answer to say that it was adopted for
the salutary purpose of protecting children.
Reversed.

Stanley Fleishman. Osmond K. Fraenkel, and Sam
Rosenwein for appellant.
Isidore Dollinger and Daniel J. Sullivan for appellee.
PER CURIAM.

Appellant, in seeking reversal of his conviction for
selling "girlie" magazines to a minor under 18 years of
age in violation of former ยง 484-i, New York Penal
Law,* argues among other grounds that the statute is
impermissibly vague. We agree. While we rejected a
like claim as to ยง 484-h in Ginsberg v. New York, 390
U. S. 629, ยง 484-i in part prohibited the sale of "any . . .
magazines... which would appeal to the lust of persons
under the age of eighteen years or to their curiosity as
to sex or to the anatomical differences between the
sexes . . . ." That standard in our view is unconstitutionally vague. "Nor is it, an answer to an argument

not directly proportional to, or a function of, the extent
of the power to regulate or control expression with respect
to children." Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas,
390 U. S. 676, 689.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK

concurs, would reverse for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S.
629, 650.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would affirm the judgment of
the state court on the premises stated in his separate
opinion in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 390
U. S. 676, 704. In addition, he considers it a particularly
fruitless judicial act to strike down on the score of vagueness a state statute which has already been repealed.
