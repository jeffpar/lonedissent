PEYTON, PENITENTIARY SUPERINTENDENT v.
ROWE ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 802. Argued March 27, 1968.-Decided May 20, 1968.
Respondents, who are incarcerated under consecutive 'state prison
sentences, have attacked as unconstitutional sentences which they
have not begun to serve, in petitions for writs of habeas corpus
which they have respectively filed in District Courts under 28
U. S. C. § 2241 (c)(3). That provision specifies that federal
district courts may issue habeas corpus writs on behalf of prisoners
who are "in custody in violation of the Constitution . . . of the
United §tates." The District Courts, relying on McNally v.
Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), denied relief, holding that the petitions
were premature since respondents were not "in custody" within
'the statute's meaning under the sentences which they were challenging and that respondents would not be able to attack those
sentences until they started to serve them, which would not be
until after 1990. The Court- of Appeals reversed, reasoning that
in light of more recent decisions this Court would no longer follow
McNally. Held: A prisoner serving consecutive sentences is "in
custody" under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c) (3)
and may in a federal habeas corpus proceeding thereunder challenge the constitutionality of a sentence scheduled for futur6
service. The decision in McNally v. Hill, supra, which was compelled neither by statute nor history and which constitutes an
indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional claims
in the federal courts, is overruled. Pp. 58-67.
383 F. 2d 709, affirmed.

Reno S. Harp III, Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the
briefs was Robert Y. Button, Attorney General.
John J. Kirby, Jr., argued the cause for respondents,
pro haw vice. With him on the brief was Thomas S.

Currier.

Opinion of the Court.

Thomas C. Lynch, Attorney General, and Edward P.
O'Brien, Derald E. Granberg, and Clifford K. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Attorneys General, filed a brief for the
State of California, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of
the Court.
This case concerns the scope of 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c)(3),
which specifies that the United States District Courts
may issue writs of habeas corpus on behalf of prisoners
who are "in custody in violation of the Constitution...
of the United States." The question presented is
whether a district court may entertain a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner incarcerated under
consecutive sentences who claims that a sentence that he
is scheduled to serve in the future is invalid because of
a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
The Court considered this issue in McNally v. Hill, 293
U. S. 131 (1934), and held that the habeas corpus statute
does not authorize attacks upon future consecutive sentences. We granted certiorari in this case to re-examine
McNally. 389 U. S. 1035 (1968). We conclude that the
decision in that case was compelled neither by statute
nor by history and that today it represents an indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional
claims in the federal courts.
Respondents, Robert Rowe and Clyde Thacker, are serving prison terms in the Virginia State Penitentiary. In
June 1963 Rowe was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment
after a jury found him guilty of rape. Subsequently, he
pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with
felonious abduction with intent to defile arising from the
same events which had led to the rape conviction.' He
Rowe's initial plea of double jeopardy had been overruled by
the trial court.

was sentenced to a 20-year term on this conviction to run
consecutively to the 30-year sentence. After exhausting
state remedies,2 Rowe petitioned for a writ of habeas
corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He did not attack the rape
conviction, but alleged that the conviction for felonious
abduction was constitutionally defective because he had
been subjected to double jeopardy, because his plea of
guilty had been involuntary, because the indictment had
failed to state an offense and because he had been inadequately represented by trial counsel. Without reaching
the merits of Rowe's claims, the District Court denied
relief. Applying McNally, the court found Rowe was
then detained under the 30-year sentence for rape. Since
he did not claim that sentence was invalid, it was held
that he was not then "in custody" under an unconstitutionally imposed sentence within the meaning of § 2241.
The court concluded that it could not entertain Rowe's
challenge to the conviction for felonious abduction -until
he was confined under the sentence imposed for that
conviction. That time would not arrive until 1993.3
Thacker's § 2241 petition in the Eastern District of
Virginia met a similar fate. He is imprisoned under a
number of sentences totaling more than 60 years. He
asserted that three consecutive five-year sentences imposed for housebreaking in 1953 were invalid because of
2

Rowe had filed an application for state habeas corpus relief in
the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. This petition was denied
under Virginia's version of the McNally rule. See Peyton v.
Wi/!iams, 206 Va. 595, 145 S. E. 2d 147 (1965). Subsequent to the

decision below, the Virginia Legislature enacted a statute, effective
June 28, 1968, which will abolish the rule of prematurity in the State.
See n. 17, infra.
8 If Rowe receives full credit for "good time," the 30-year sentence
will expire in 1982. Under the two sentences, he will be eligible for
parole in 1974. If he were relieved of the 20-year term, he would
be eligible for parole in 1970. See Va. Code Ann. § 53-251 (1967).

inadequate representation by counsel at the time he
entered pleas of guilty.4 Finding that Thacker's attack
on these sentences was premature because he had not
begun to serve them, the District Court dismissed the
petition "without prejudice to Thacker's reapplication
at the proper time." Under McNally, the "proper time"
will be in 1994 when Thacker commences service of the
first of the three sentences he challenges.5
The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit consolidated the two cases. After a hearing en banc, it reversed and remanded them to the District Courts. 383
F. 2d 709 (1967). Recognizing that the District Courts
had correctly applied McNally, the Court of Appeals
declined to adhere to that decision. Writing for a
unanimous court, Chief Judge Haynsworth reasoned that
this Court would no longer follow McNally, which in his
view represented a "doctrinaire approach" based on an
"old jurisdictional concept" which had been "thoroughly
rejected by the Supreme Court in recent cases." 6 Id.,
4

These sentences were originally suspended, but the suspension

was revoked in 1956.
5If Thacker does not receive good-time credit, he will commence
service of the three sentences in 2009. He will be eligible for parole
in 1976.
6 The decision of the Court of Appeals in the present ease was
preceded by two cases in which it held that § 2241 (c) (3) permits
attack upon a future consecutive sentence which affects or may
affect a prisoner's current parole eligibility.

Williams v. Peyton,

372 F. 2d 216 (C. -A. 4th Cir. 1967); Martin v. Virginia, 349 F. 2d
781 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1965). In McNally,. the Court rejected the
prisoner's argument that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief
because he would he eligible for parole if the. challenged sentence
were invalidated. 293 U. S., at 134, 140. In Williams and Martin,
the Court of Appeals concluded that this Court's decision in Jones
v..Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963), represented a departure from
this narrow reading of the habeas corpus statute.

at 714. We are in complete agreement with this conclusion and the considerations underlying it.
The writ of habeas corpus is a procedural device forsubjecting executive,' judicial,' or private I restraints on
liberty to judicial scrutiny. Where it is available, it
assures among other things that a prisoner may require
his jailer to justify the detention under the law.'" In
England where it originated and in the United States,
this high purpose has made ,the writ both the symbol and
guardian of individual liberty. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries "131-1383 see Ex parte Bollman; 4 Cranch 75
(1807); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874); Moore v.

U. S. 458 (1938); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953);
Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963).
The habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts is
enumerated in 28 U. S. C. § 2241. Likethe predecessor
statute which controlled in McNally," § 2241 provides for
E. g., Darnel's Case ["Five Knights' Case"] 3 How. St. Tr.

,0 The indignation aroused by the decision in 'Darnel's Case,
supra, n.. 7, led to enactment in 1627 of the Petition of Right,
3 Car. 1, c. 1, which condemned a return reciting that imprisonment
was -by "speciale mandatum Domini Regis" as insufficient under
"the law of the land." See W. Church, A Treatise on the Writ of
Habeas Corpus 8-9 (2d ed. 1893). In th6 United States, the Act
of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, made the writ available to
"any person . . . restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the
constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States."

Opinion of the Court.

the issuance of writs on behalf of persons "in custody."
But the statute does not attempt to define the terms
"habeas corpus" or "custody." Confronted with this
fact, the Court in McNally reasoned that "[t]o ascertain
its meaning and the appropriate use of the writ in the
federal courts, recourse must be had to the common
law . . . and to the decisions of this Court interpreting
and applying the common law principles ....
" McNally
v. Hill, 293 U. S., at 136. We need not look very far to
discover three principal characteristics of the writ as it
had developed in the federal courts even before the decision in McNally. First, though the writ in England had
been utilized largely to secure the admission to bail and
discharge of prisoners,"2 its major office in the federal
courts since the Civil War has been to provide postconviction relief." Second, the partial codifications of
the common-law writ in England and more recent legislation in this country have contained specific and detailed
provisions requiring prompt adjudication of the validity
of the challenged restraint. See and compare Habeas
Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, c. 2; Act of February 5,
1867, .c. 28, 14 Stat. 385; and 28 U. S. C. § 2243. Third,
at least tentatively in Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.309
12The

celebrated Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, c. 2,

was concerned exclusively with providing an efficacious remedy for
pretrial imprisonment. See W Church, A Treatise on the Writ of
Habeas Corpus 21-32, 48-58 (2d ed. 1893).
"I This development is explained in part by this Court's recognition that certain trial or sentencing defects could invalidate the
proceedings in a court which had jurisdiction over the crime and
the defendant, e. g., Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874), by the
Court's decisions holding that some of the safeguards of criminal
procedure embodied in the Bill of Rights are applicable to state
criminal proceedings by virtue of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, and by the requirement-that a state prisoner exhaust state remedies before applying for federal habeas
corpus. Ex parte RoyaU, 117 U. S. 241 (1886); 28 U. S. C.
§ 2254; see Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 415-420 (1963).

Opinion of the Court.

391 U. S.

(1915), and more clearly in Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S.

86 (1923), this Court had recognized that a district court
was authorized to look behind the bare record of a
trial proceeding and conduct a factual hearing to determine the merits of alleged deprivations of constitutional
rights 14-a
procedure that reached full flowering in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938). Thus, by the time
McNally was decided, the federal writ of habeas corpus
was substantially a post-conviction device which could
afford prompt adjudication of factual as well as legal
issues. Keeping these purposes of the writ in mind, we
turn to consideration of the McNally holding and the
reasons which compel us to overrule it.
A federal jury had found McNally guilty of three
counts' of an indictment charging offenses under the
Motor Vehicle Theft Act (now 18 U. S. C. §§ 23122313).11 He had been sentenced to two years on the first
count and four years each on the second and third counts,
the sentences on the first and second counts to run con14

The Court in Frank recognized that the Act of February 5,

1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, substituted "for the bare legal review
that seems to have been the limit of judicial authority under the
common-law practice . . .a more searching investigation, in which

the applicant is put upon his oath to set forth the truth of the
matter respecting the causes of his detention, and the court, upon
determining the actual facts, is to 'dispose of the party as law and
Jpice require.'" 237 U. S., at 330-331. In Moore, the Court
:remanded the case to the District Court for determination of the
truth of allegations that the pervading influence of a mob had denied
the appellants a fair trial in the state court. 261 U. S., at 92.
15 Because McNally was imprisoned by federal authorities, his
application for habeas corpus relief could have rested on the clause
of Rev. Stat. § 753 (1874) which authorized federal courts to entertain petitions from prisoners in the custody of the United States.
However, the Court's interpretation of the custody requirement in
McNally was equally applicable to state prisoners claiming their
incarceration violated the Constitution. E. g., Darr v. Burford,
339 U. S. 200, 203 (1950).

currently and the sentence on the third consecutively.
In his application in a district court for a writ of habeas
corpus, McNally claimed that the indictment failed to
state- an offense as to the third count. He did not attack
the convictions under the first and second counts. When
he filed, his petition he was serving under the second
count. The lower courts denied relief on the merits.
But; this Court affirmed on a jurisdictional ground, hold- ing that because McNally had not begun to serve the
sentence on the third count-and therefore was not "in
custody" under that sentence-his petition for relief was
premature:
"[W]ithout -retraint which is unlawful, the writ
may not be used. A sentence which the prisoner
has not begun to serve cannot be the cause of restraint which the statute makes the subject of
inquiry." 293 U. S., at 138.
The effect of this disposition was ameliorated somewhat
by the Court's suggestion that McNally might seek
relief by another route. Id., at 140. See also Holiday
v. John8ton, 313 U. S.342, 349 (1941). But cf. Ex parte
Hull, 312 U. S.546 (1941). Moreover, McNally's challenge was directed at the face of the indictment. Therefore, postponement of adjudication of his claims probably would not have resulted in the loss of crucial evidence. But the harshness of a rule which may delay determination of federal claims for decades becomes obvious
when applied to the cases of Rowe and Thacker. Their
cases also exemplify the manner in which the decision
in McNally cuts against the prior and subsequent development of the writ in the federal courts.
Both Rowe and Thacker allege, that they were so inadequately repriesented at trial that they were denied the
assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Petitioner concedes that, but for

McNally, respondents' allegations would entitle them to
plenary hearings in the District Courts. Brief for Petitioner 6. Yet, under the current schedules of confinement, it is argued, neither Rowe nor Thacker may
obtain adjudication of his claims-until after 1990. By
that time, dimmed memories or the death of Witnesses
is bound to render it difficult or impossible to secure
crucial testimony on disputed issues of fact. Of course
prejudice to meritorious claims resulting from the kind
of delay which McNally imposes is not limited to situations involving ineffective assistance of counsel. To
name but a few examples, factual determinations are
often dispositive of claims of coerced confession, e. g.,
Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 (1961), Leyra v. Denno, 347
U. S. 556 (1954); lack of competency to stand trial,
e. g., Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375 (1966); and denial
of a fair trial, e. g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333
(1966). Postponement of the adjudication of such
issues for years can harm both the prisoner and the State
and lessens the probability that final disposition of the
case will do substantial justice." As the Court of
Appeals observed:
"Years hence, the prisoner, at least, may be expected
to give testimonial support to the allegations of his
petition, but if they are false in fact, the Commonwealth of Virginia may be unable to refute them
because of the unavailability of records and of the
testimony of responsible officials and participants
in the trial. The greater the lapse of time, the
more unlikely it becomes that the state could reprosecute if retrials are held to be necessary. It
16 Even

where resolution of constitutional claims turns on record
evidence, loss or destruction of a relevant document or failure to
transcribe the record over a period of years, cf. Norvell v. Illinois,
373 U. S. 420 (1963), could mean that a claim relegated to the limbo
of prematurity might never be adequately determined.

is to the great interest of the Commonwealth and
to the prisoner to have these matters determined
as soon as possible when there is the greatest likelihood the truth of the matter may be established." ',
383 F. 2d, at 715.
Clearly, to the extent that the rule of McNally postpones plenary consideration of issues by the district
courts, it undermines the character of the writ of habeas
corpus as the instrument for resolving fact issues not
adequately developed in the original proceedings. To
that extent, it also undermines Moore v. Dempsey, supra,
and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this
Court which have reaffirmed Moore. E. g., Johnson v.
Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S.
443 (1953); Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963).
McNally is also at odds with the purpose of the writ
of habeas corpus in another respect. As .noted above,
a principal aim of the writ is to provide for swift judicial review of alleged unlawful restraints on .liberty.
Calendar congestion, considerations --of federalism, see,
e. g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420; Ex parte Royall,
17 This consideration has led at least two States which previously
followed the prematurity doctrine to reject it in recent years. See
Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, 419 Pa. 1, 213 A. '2d 613
(1965); Ore. Rev. Stat.- § 138.510 (1961). -See also Landreth v.
Gladden, 213 Ore. 205, 324 P. 2d 475 (1958). California does not
follow the McNally rule. In re Chapman, 43 Cal. 2d 385, 273 P.
2d 817 (1954). Finally, while this case was under consideration in
this Court, Virginia repudiated the prematurity doctrine by statute.
See Va. S. No. 44, 1968 Sess., amending Va. Code Ann. § 8-596 (effective June 28, 1968). A committee of the American Bar Association
which- is inquiring into post-conviction remedies has recommended
abandonment of the prematurity doctrine which it calls "one of
the most frustiating elements of present post-conviction practice."

117 U. S. 241 (1886), and the exigencies of appellate
review account for largely unavoidable delays in the processing of criminal cases. But the prematurity rule of
McNally in many instances extends without practical
justification the time a prisoner entitled to release must
remain in confinement. Rowe and Thacker eventually
may establish that the convictions they challenge were
obtained in violation of the Constitution. If they do,
each day they are incarcerated under those convictions
while their cases are in the courts will be time that they
might properly have enjoyed as free men. Common
sense dictates that prisoners seeking habeas corpus relief
after exhausting state remedies should be able to do so
at the earliest practicable time.
The foregoing analysis demonstrates that McNally is
inconsistent with the purposes underlying the federal
writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, in arriving at its
decision, the Court in McNally relied in part upon an
unnecessarily narrow interpretation of the habeas corpus
statute. Standing alone, the limitation of § 2241 (c)
(3)-that "[t]he writ of habeas corpus shall not extend
to a prisoner unless . . . [h]e is in custody in violation
of the Constitution"-is not free of ambiguity. However, in common understanding "custody" comprehends
respondents' status for the entire duration of their
imprisonment. Practically speaking, Rowe is in custody
for 50 years, or for the aggregate of his 30- and 20-year
sentences. For purposes of parole eligibility, under Virginia law he is incarcerated for 50 years. Va. Code Ann.
§ 53-251 (1967); see n. 3, supra. Nothing on the face
of § 2241 militates against an interpretation which views
Rowe and Thacker as being "in custody" under the
aggregate of the consecutive sentences imposed on them.
Under that interpretation, they are "in custody in violation of the Constitution" if any consecutive sentence
they are scheduled to serve was imposed as the result

Opinion of the Court.

of a deprivation of constitutional rights. This approach
to the statute is consistent with the canon of construction that remedial statutes should be liberally construed.
It also eliminates the inconsistencies between purpose
and practice which flow from the McNally holding.
Meaningful factual hearings on alleged constitutional
deprivations can be conducted before memories and records grow stale, and at least one class of prisoners will
have the opportunity to challenge defective convictions
and obtain relief without having to spend unwarranted
months or years in prison.
We find unpersuasive the arguments made in McNally
to support the narrower interpretation of the custody
requirement. No .prior decision of the Court was cited
as clear authority for the prematurity doctrine. 8 To
fill the gap, the Court relied on the history of the writ
in England prior to 1789 and a line of reasoning whose
unexamined premise was doubtful before McNally and
was subsequently rejected. Both the historical and conceptual bases of the opinion are revealed in the Court's
observation that "[d]iligent search of the English authorities and the digests before 1789 has failed to disclose
any case where the writ was sought or used . . .as a
means of securing the judicial decision of any question
which, even if determined in the prisoner's favor, could
18

Of the prior decisions of this Court cited in McNally, only In re

Swan, 150 U. S. 637 (1893), suggested a rule of prematurity. Even
in Swan, the Court held no more than that the prisoner was iaot
entitled to immediate discharge from confinement merely because
the sentencing judge had imposed an allegedly unauthorized fine
in addition to a valid prison term. 150 U. S., at 653. In at least
two cases, Morgan v. Devine, 237 U. S. 632 (1915), and Ex parte
Spencer, 228 U. S. 652 (1913), the Court had reached the merits
of habeas corpus applications by prisoners who had not served the
valid portions of their sentences. Though relief was ultimately
denied in Morgan and Spencer, they. illustrate that the prior
decisions of the Court by no means compelled the McNally result.

not have resulted in his immediate release." McNally
v. Hill, 293 U. S., at 137-138. To the extent that the
Court thought that the absence of eighteenth century
English precedent demonstrated that McNally was not
entitled to habeas corpus relief, the Court's reliance
seems to have been misplaced. In light of the fact that
English judges had no power to impose cumulative punishment in felony cases,'9 and apparently did not assume
such power in misdemeanor cases until 1769,"' it is not
at all surprising that research failed to uncover a pre1789. common-law analogy for McNally's petition for
relief. In any event, the development of the writ of
habeas corpus did not end in 1789. What we said of the
writ in a similar context in Jones v. Cunningham, 371
U. S. 236 (1963), is equally applicable here.
"[The writ] is not now and never has been a static,
narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to
achieve its grand purpose-the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from
wrongful restraints upon their liberty." Id., at 243.
Of course the excursion in McNally into h istory to
determine that the writ of habeas corpus issued only to
adjudicate entitlement to "immediate release": was not
unnecessary. Though McNally held only that. the petitioner did not . meet the custody requirements of the
statute, see Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U. S. 335 (1968),
that holding rested in part on the premise that physical
discharge from custody is the only relief available in a
habeas corpus proceeding. But the statute does not deny
the federal courts power to fashion appropriate relief
other than immediate release. Since 1874, the habeas

corpus statute has directed the courts to determine the
facts and dispose of the case summarily, "as law and
justice require." Rev. Stat. § 761 (1874), superseded by
28 U. S. C. § 2243. Consistently with this command,
this Court has held that a prisoner whose first-sentence
parole was revoked upon a second conviction could challenge the second conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding
though he would not be released if he prevailed, Ex parte
Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941); that a person who was paroled
after he filed his habeas corpus petition could still obtain relief from the restraints imposed by the parole conditions, Jones v. Cunningham, supra; and that a prisoner
could attack the first of two consecutive sentences in a
federal habeas corpus proceeding even though he would
still be confined under the second sentence if he succeeded, Walker v. Wainwright, supra. See also United
States v. Pridgeon; 153 U. S. 48, 63-64 (1894). Thus,
to the extent that .McNally relied on the notion that
immediate physical release was the only remedy under
the federal writ of habeas corpus, it finds no support in

the statute and has been rejected by this Court in subsequent decisions.
We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving
consecutive sentences is "incustody" under any one of
them for purposes of § 2241 (c) (3).21 This interpretation is consistent with the statutory language and with
the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus in the-federal
