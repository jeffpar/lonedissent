ROSS v. BERNHARD
Opinion of the Court

ROSS ET AL., TRUSTEES v. BERNHARD ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 42. Argued November 10, 1969-Decided February 2, 1970
The right to trial by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment
extends to a stockholder's derivative suit with respect to those
issues as to which the corporation, had it been suing in its own

right, would have been entitled to a jury trial.
403 F. 2d 909, reversed.

William E. Haudek argued the cause for petitioners.
With him on the briefs were Richard M. Meyer and
Stanley M. Grossman.
Marvin Schwartz argued the cause for respondents.
With him on the brief were Roger L. Waldman, William
J. Manning, and E. Roger Frisch.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides
that in "[s]uits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved." Whether the Amendment
guarantees the right to a jury trial in stockholders' derivative actions is the issue now before us.
Petitioners brought this derivative suit in federal
court against the directors of their closed-end investment
company, the Lehman Corporation, and the corporation's brokers, Lehman Brothers. They contended that
Lehman Brothers controlled the corporation through an
illegally large representation on the corporation's board
of directors, in violation of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U. S. C. § 80a-1 et seq., and used
this control to extract excessive brokerage fees from the
corporation. The directors of the corporation were accused of converting corporate assets and of "gross abuse

of trust, gross misconduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith,
[and] gross negligence." Both the individual defendants
and Lehman Brothers were accused of breaches of fiduciary duty. It was alleged that the payments to Lehman
Brothers constituted waste and spoliation, and that the
contract between the corporation and Lehman Brothers
had been violated. Petitioners requested that the defendants "account for and pay to the Corporation for
their profits and gains and its losses." Petitioners also
demanded a jury trial on the corporation's claims.
On motion to strike petitioners' jury trial demand, the
District Court held that a shareholder's right to a jury
on his corporation's cause of action was to be judged as
if the corporation were itself the plaintiff. Only the
shareholder's initial claim to speak for the corporation
had to be tried to the judge. 275 F. Supp. 569. Convinced that "there are substantial grounds for difference
of opinion as to this question and . . . an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination
of this litigation," the District Court permitted an interlocutory appeal. 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b). The Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that a derivative action
was entirely equitable in nature, and no jury was available to try any part of it. 403 F. 2d 909. It specifically
disagreed with DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins.
Co., 323 F. 2d 826 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied,
376 U. S. 950 (1964), on which the District Court had
relied. Because of this conflict, we granted certiorari.
394 U. S. 917 (1969).
We reverse the holding of the Court of Appeals that
in no event does the right to a jury trial preserved by
the Seventh Amendment extend to derivative actions
brought by the stockholders of a corporation. We hold
that the right to jury trial attaches to those issues in
derivative actions as to which the corporation, if it had

ROSS v. BERNHARD
531

Opinion of the Court

been suing in its own right, would have been entitled
to a jury.
The Seventh Amendment preserves to litigants the
right to jury trial in suits at common law"not merely suits, which the common law recognized
among its old and settled proceedings, but suits in
which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those where equitable
rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies
were administered ....
In a just sense, the amendment then may well be construed to embrace all
suits which are not of equity and admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which
they may assume to settle legal rights." Parsons v.
Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 447 (1830).
However difficult it may have been to define with
precision the line between actions at law dealing with
legal rights and suits in equity dealing with equitable
matters, Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U. S. 146, 151
(1891), some proceedings were unmistakably actions at
law triable to a jury. The Seventh Amendment, for example, entitled the parties to a jury trial in actions for
damages to a person or property, for libel and slander,
for recovery of land, and for conversion of personal
property.' Just as clearly, a corporation, although an
artificial being, was commonly entitled to sue and be
sued in the usual forms of action, at least in its own
State. See Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168 (1869).
Whether the corporation was viewed as an entity separate
from its stockholders or as a device permitting its stockholders to carry on their business and to sue and be sued,
a corporation's suit to enforce a legal right was an action

at common law carrying the right to jury trial at the time
the Seventh Amendment was adopted. 2
The common law refused, however, to permit stockholders to call corporate managers to account in actions
at law. The possibilities for abuse, thus presented, were
not ignored by corporate officers and directors. Early
in the 19th century, equity provided relief both in
this country and in England. Without detailing these
developments,' it suffices to say that the remedy in this
country, first dealt with by this Court in Dodge v.
Woolsey, 18 How. 331 (1856), provided redress not only
against faithless officers and directors but also against
third parties who had damaged or threatened the corporate properties and whom the corporation through its
managers refused to pursue. The remedy made available
in equity was the derivative suit, viewed in this country
as a suit to enforce a corporate cause of action against
officers, directors, and third parties. As elaborated in the
cases, one precondition for the suit was a valid claim on
which the corporation could have sued; another Was that
the corporation itself had refused to proceed after suitable4
demand, unless excused by extraordinary conditions.
Thus the dual nature of the stockholder's action: first,

the plaintiff's right to sue on behalf of the corporation
and, second, the merits of the corporation's claim itself.'
Derivative suits posed no Seventh Amendment problems where the action against the directors and third
parties would have been by a bill in equity had the corporation brought the suit. Our concern is with cases
based upon a legal claim of the corporation against
directors or third parties. Does the trial of such claims
at the suit of a stockholder and without a jury violate
the Seventh Amendment?
The question arose in this Court in the context of a
derivative suit for treble damages under the antitrust
laws. Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240
U. S. 27 (1916). Noting that the bill in equity set
up a claim of the corporation alone, Mr. Justice Holmes
observed that if the corporation were the plaintiff, "no
one can doubt that its only remedy would be at law,"
and inquired "why the defendants' right to a jury trial
should be taken away because the present plaintiff
cannot persuade the only party having a cause of action
to sue--how the liability which is the principal matter
can be converted into an incident of the plaintiff's domestic difficulties with the company that has been wronged"?
Id., at 28. His answer was that the bill did not state
a good cause of action in equity. Agreeing that there
were "cases in which the nature of the right asserted for
the company, or the failure of the defendants concerned
to insist upon their rights, or a different state system, has
5See Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U. S. 518,
522-523 (1947); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288 (1936). See
also 13 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations
§ 5941.1 (1961 ed.); 2 G. Hornstein, Corporation Law and Practice
§ 716 (1959); 4 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence § 1095, p. 278
(5th ed. 1941). Insofar as the stockholders may have been asserting
their own direct interest, they closely resemble other class action
plaintiffs who could proceed, before merger, only in equity.

led to the whole matter being disposed of in equity," he
concluded that when the penalty of triple damages is
sought, the antitrust statute plainly anticipated a jury
trial and should not be read as "attempting to authorize
liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law." Id., at 28-29.
Although the decision had obvious Seventh Amendment
overtones, its ultimate rationale was grounded in the
antitrust laws.'
Where penal damages were not involved, however,
there was no authoritative parallel to Fleitmann in the
federal system squarely passing on the applicability of
the Seventh Amendment to the trial of a legal claim
presented in a pre-merger derivative suit. What can
be gleaned from this Court's opinions is not inconsistent
6 The dilemma of the stockholder seeking treble damages for the
corporation became real and complete in United Copper Co. v.
Amalgamated Copper Co., 244 U. S. 261 (1917), where the stockholder-plaintiff sought treble damages in an action at law. The
Court rejected the claim by reiterating the traditional view that
a shareholder was without standing to sue at law on a corporate
cause. The treble-damage action was a legal proceeding and only
the corporation could bring it. The Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit has held that the federal rules have resolved the
dilemma and that, derivative actions for treble damages under the
antitrust laws are now proper. Fanchon & Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 202 F. 2d 731 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1953). Cf.
Ramsburg v. American Inv. Co. of Ill., 231 F. 2d 333 (C. A. 7th
Cir. 1956). See generally Comment, Federal Antitrust LawStockholders' Remedies For Corporate Injury Resulting From Antitrust Violations: Derivative Antitrust Suit and Fiduciary Duty
Action, 59 Mich. L. Rev. 904 (1961).
7 For example, in Amalgamated Copper the Court noted that in
Quincy v. Steel, 120 U. S. 241 (1887), a shareholder's bill in equity
that sought to enforce "a purely legal claim of the corporationdamages for breach of contract" was dismissed, "not because the
suit should have been at law, but because the bill failed to show
that complainant had made sufficient effort to induce the directors

with the general understanding, reflected by the state
court decisions and secondary sources, that equity could
properly resolve corporate claims of any kind without a
jury when properly pleaded in derivative suits complying
with the equity rules.'
Such was the prevailing opinion when the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted in 1938. It continued until 1963 when the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, relying on the Federal Rules as construed
and applied in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359
U. S. 500 (1959), and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369
U. S. 469 (1962), required the legal issues in a derivative
suit to be tried to a jury.' DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., 323 F. 2d 826. It was this decision
that the District Court followed in the case before us
and that the Court of Appeals rejected.
Beacon and Dairy Queen presaged DePinto. Under
those cases, where equitable and legal claims are joined
to enter suit." 244 U. S., at 264-265, n. 2. Delaware & Hudson Co.
v. Albany & S. R. Co., supra, n. 4, involved a derivative suit
for money damages due under a lease. The stockholders' right
to sue was sustained; no jury trial issue appears to have been raised.
8 See, e. g., Goetz v. Manufacturers' & Traders' Trust Co., 154
Misc. 733, 277 N. Y. S. 802 (Sup. Ct. 1935); Isaac v. Marcus,
258 N. Y. 257, 179 N. E. 487 (1932); Morton v. Morton Realty
Co., 41 Idaho 729, 241 P. 1014 (1925); Neff v. Barber, 165 Wis.

1923); S.Thompson & J. Thompson, Law of Corporations § 4661
(Supp. 1931); 6 id., § 4653 (3d ed. 1927).
The possibility that the merged federal practice altered the
procedures in derivative suits was early recognized, Fanchon &
Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., supra, n. 6, but until
the action of the District Court below DePinto was alone in holding
that a right to a jury trial existed in derivative actions. Cf. Richland v. Crandall, 259 F. Supp. 274 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1966). See
also Metcalf v. Shamel, 166 Cal. App. 2d 789, 333 P. 2d 857 (1959) ;
Steinway v. Griffith Consol. Theatres, 273 P. 2d 872 (Okla. 1954).

OCTOBER TERM, 1969
Opinion of the Court

396 U. S.

in the same action, there is a right to jury trial on the
legal claims which must not be infringed either by
trying the legal issues as incidental to the equitable
ones or by a court trial of a common issue existing between the claims. The Seventh Amendment question
depends on the nature of the issue to be tried rather than
the character of the overall action. 0 See Simler v.
Conner, 372 U. S. 221 (1963). The principle of these
cases bears heavily on derivative actions.
We have noted that the derivative suit has dual aspects: first, the stockholder's right to sue on behalf of the
corporation, historically an equitable matter; second, the
claim of the corporation against directors or third parties
on which, if the corporation had sued and the claim presented legal issues, the company could demand a jury
trial. As implied by Mr. Justice Holmes in Fleitmann,
legal claims are not magically converted into equitable
issues by their presentation to a court of equity in a
derivative suit. The claim pressed by the stockholder
against directors or third parties "is not his own but the
corporation's." Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,
330 U. S. 518, 522 (1947).
The corporation is a necessary party to the action; without it the case cannot
proceed. Although named a defendant, it is the real
party in interest, the stockholder being at best the nominal plaintiff. The proceeds of the action belong to the
corporation and it is bound by the result of the suit. 1

'oAs our cases indicate, the "legal" nature of an issue is determined by considering, first, the pre-merger custom with reference
to such questions; second, the remedy sought; and, third, the
practical abilities and limitations of juries. Of these factors, the
first, requiring extensive and possibly abstruse historical inquiry, is
obviously the most difficult to apply. See James, Right to a Jury
Trial in Civil Actions, 72 Yale L. J. 655 (1963).
21 See Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U. S. 518 (1947);
Meyer v. Fleming, 327 U. S. 161, 167 (1946); Davenport v. Dows,
18 Wall. 626 (1874).

ROSS v. BERNHARD
531

Opinion of the Court

The heart of the action is the corporate claim. If it
presents a legal issue, one entitling the corporation to a
jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, the right to a
jury is not forfeited merely because the stockholder's
right to sue must first be adjudicated as an equitable
issue triable to the court. Beacon and Dairy Queen
require no less.
If under older procedures, now discarded, a court of
equity could properly try the legal claims of the corporation presented in a derivative suit, it was because irreparable injury was threatened and no remedy at law
existed as long as the stockholder was without standing
to sue and the corporation itself refused to pursue its
own remedies. Indeed, from 1789 until 1938, the judicial
code expressly forbade courts of equity from entertaining
any suit for which there was an adequate remedy at
law." This provision served "to guard the right of trial
by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment and to
that end it should be liberally construed." Schoenthal v.
Irving Trust Co., 287 U. S. 92, 94 (1932). If, before
1938, the law had borrowed from equity, as it borrowed
other things, the idea that stockholders could litigate for
their recalcitrant corporation, the corporate claim, if
legal, would undoubtedly have been tried to a jury.
Of course, this did not occur, but the Federal Rules
had a similar impact. Actions are no longer brought as
actions at law or suits in equity. Under the Rules there
is only one action-a "civil action"-in which all claims
may be joined and all remedies are available. Purely
procedural impediments to the presentation of any issue
by any party, based on the difference between law and

any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had

equity, were destroyed. In a civil action presenting a
stockholder's derivative claim, the court after passing
upon the plaintiff's right to sue on behalf of the corporation is now able to try the corporate claim for damages
with the aid of a jury." Separable claims may be tried
separately, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42 (b), or legal and
equitable issues may be handled in the same trial. Fanchon & Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 202 F.
2d 731 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1953). The historical rule preventing a court of law from entertaining a shareholder's
suit on behalf of the corporation is obsolete; it is no
longer tenable for a district court, administering both
law and equity in the same action, to deny legal remedies
to a corporation, merely because the corporation's spokesmen are its shareholders rather than its directors. Under
the rules, law and equity are procedurally combined;
nothing turns now upon the form of the action or the
procedural devices by which the parties happen to come
before the court. The "expansion of adequate legal
remedies provided by . . . the Federal Rules necessarily

affects the scope of equity." Beacon Theatres, Inc. v.
Westover, 359 U. S., at 509.
Thus, for example, before-merger class actions were
largely a device of equity, and there was no right to a
jury even on issues that might, under other circumstances, have been tried to a jury. 5 J. Moore, Federal
It would appear that the same conclusions could have been
reached under Equity Rule 23 and the Law and Equity Act of
1915, Act of March 3, 1915, 38 Stat. 956. See Southern R. Co.
v. City of Greenwood, 40 F. 2d 679 (D. C. W. D. S. C. 1928);
2 J. Moore, Federal Practice 2.05 (2d ed. 1967). Rule 23 provided:
"If in a suit in equity a matter ordinarily determinable at law
arises, such matter shall be determined in that suit according to the
principles applicable, without sending the case or question to the
law side of the court."

Although at least one post-merger court held that the

settled in the lower federal courts that class action plaintiffs may obtain a jury trial on any legal issues they
present. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Langer, 168 F. 2d

Derivative suits have been described as one kind of

could not speak at law.15 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice

Other equitable devices are used under the rules without depriv-

ing the parties employing them of the right to a jury trial on legal
issues. For example, although the right to intervene may in some

cases be limited, United States for the Use and Benefit of Browne &
Bryan Lumber Co. v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 303 F. 2d
823 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1962); Dickinson v. Burnham, 197 F. 2d 973
(C. A. 2d Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U. S. 875 (1952), when intervention
is permitted generally, the intervenor has a right to a jury trial on
any legal issues he presents. See 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice
24.16 [7] (2d ed. 1969); 5 id., 38.38 [3]. A similar development seems to be taking place in the lower courts in interpleader actions. Before merger interpleader actions lay only in
equity, and there was no right to a jury even on issues that
might, under other circumstances, have been tried to a jury.
Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat. Bank, 260 U. S. 235 (1922).
This view continued for some time after merger, see Bynum

OCTOBER TERM, 1969

396 U. S.

11123.02 [1], 23.1.16 [1] (2d ed. 1969). After adoption
of the rules there is no longer any procedural obstacle to
the assertion of legal rights before juries, however the
party may have acquired standing to assert those rights.
Given the availability in a derivative action of both legal
and equitable remedies, we think the Seventh Amendment preserves to the parties in a stockholder's suit the
same right to a jury trial that historically belonged to
the corporation and to those against whom the corporation pressed its legal claims.
In the instant case we have no doubt that the corporation's claim is, at least in part, a legal one. The
relief sought is money damages. There are allegations
in the complaint of a breach of fiduciary duty, but there
are also allegations of ordinary breach of contract and
gross negligence. The corporation, had it sued on its
own behalf, would have been entitled to a jury's determination, at a minimum, of its damages against its
broker under the brokerage contract and of its rights
against its own directors because of their negligence.
Under these circumstances it is unnecessary to decide
v. Prudential Life Ins. Co., 7 F. R. D. 585 (D. C. E. D. S. C.
1947), but numerous courts and commentators have now come
to the conclusion that the right to a jury should not turn on
how the parties happen to be brought into court. See Pan
American Fire & Cas. Co. v. Revere, 188 F. Supp. 474 (D. C.
E. D. La. 1960); Savannah Bank & Trust Co. v. Block, 175 F. Supp.

JUSTICE HARLAN

In holding as it does that the plaintiff in a shareholder's derivative suit is constitutionally entitled to a
jury trial, the Court today seems to rely upon some sort
of ill-defined combination of the Seventh Amendment
and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Somehow the
Amendment and the Rules magically interact to do what
each separately was expressly intended not to do, namely,
to enlarge the right to a jury trial in civil actions brought
in the courts of the United States.
The Seventh Amendment, by its terms, does not extend,
but merely preserves the right to a jury trial "[iun Suits
at common law." All agree that this means the reach of
the Amendment is limited to those actions that were
tried to the jury in 1791 when the Amendment was
adopted.' Suits in equity, which were historically tried
to the court, were therefore unaffected by it. Similarly,
Rule 38 of the Federal Rules has no bearing on the right
to a jury trial in suits in equity, for it simply preserves
inviolate "[t]he right of trial by jury as declared by the
Seventh Amendment." Thus this Rule, like the Amendment itself, neither restricts nor enlarges the right to jury
I Where a new cause of action is created by Congress, and nothing
is said about how it is to be tried, the jury trial issue is determined
by fitting the cause into its nearest historical analogy. Luria v.

Civil Actions, 72 Yale L. J. 655.

trial.' Indeed nothing in the Federal Rules can rightly
be construed to enlarge the right of jury trial, for in the
legislation authorizing the Rules, Congress expressly provided that they "shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant." 48 Stat. 1064.
See 28 U. S. C. § 2072. I take this plain, simple, and
straightforward language to mean that after the promulgation of the Federal Rules, as before, the constitutional right to a jury trial attaches only to suits at
common law. So, apparently, has every federal court
that has discussed the issue.' Since, as the Court concedes, a shareholder's derivative suit could be brought
only in equity, it would seem to me to follow by the most
elementary logic that in such suits there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury.4 . Today the Court tosses
aside history, logic, and over 100 years of firm precedent
to hold that the plaintiff in a shareholder's derivative

Virtually every state and federal court that has faced this
issue has similarly reasoned to the same conclusion. See, e. g.,
Goetz v. Manufacturers' & Traders' Trust Co., 154 Misc. 733, 277
N. Y. S. 802 (Sup. Ct.); Metcalf v. Shamel, 166 Cal. App. 2d 789,
333 P. 2d 857; Liken v. Shaffer, 64 F. Supp. 432; Miller v. Weiant,
42 F. Supp. 760. The equitable nature of the derivative suit has been
recognized in several decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cohen v.
Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 547-548. It was also
reflected in the adoption of Equity Rule 94 in 1882, and Rule 27 of
the Equity Rules of 1912 which established the preconditions to
bringing shareholders' derivative suits in the federal courts. These
rules are the forerunners of Rule 23 (b) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. of
1938, and of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23.1 (1966), which now controls the
initiation of such suits. See 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice

suit does indeed have a constitutional right to a trial by
jury. This holding has a questionable basis in policy
and no basis whatever in the Constitution.
The Court begins by assuming the "dual nature" of the
shareholder's action. While the plaintiff's right to get
into court at all is conceded to be equitable, once he is
there the Court says his claim is to be viewed as though
it were the claim of the corporation itself. If the corporation would have been entitled to a jury trial on such
a claim, then, it is said, so would the shareholder. This
conceptualization is without any historical basis. For
the fact is that a shareholder's suit was not originally
viewed in this country, or in England, as a suit to enforce
a corporate cause of action. Rather, the shareholder's
suit was initially permitted only against the managers of
the corporation-not third parties-and it was conceived
of as an equitable action to enforce the right of a beneficiary against his trustee.' The shareholder was not,
therefore, in court to enforce indirectly the corporate
right of action, but to enforce directly his own equitable
right of action against an unfaithful fiduciary. Later the
rights of the shareholder were enlarged to encompass suits
against third parties harming the corporation, but "the
postulated 'corporate cause of action' has never been
thought to describe an actual historical class of suit which
5See, e. g., J. Frank, Courts on Trial 110-111 (1949). Certainly
there is no consensus among commentators on the desirability of
jury trials in civil actions generally. Particularly where the issues
in the case are complex-as they are likely to be in a derivative
suit-much can be said for allowing the court discretion to try

the case itself. See discussion in 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice

was recognized by courts of law." 7 Indeed the commentators, including those cited by the Court as postulating
the analytic duality of the shareholder's derivative suit,
recognize that historically the suit has in practice always
been treated as a single cause tried exclusively in equity.
They agree that there is therefore no constitutional right
to a jury trial even where there might have been one
had the corporation itself brought the suit.'
This has been not simply the "general" or "prevailing"
view in the federal courts as the Court says, but the
unanimous view with the single exception of the Ninth
Circuit's 1963 decision in DePinto v. Provident Security
Life Ins. Co., 323 F. 2d 826, a decision that has since
been followed by no court until the present case.
The Court would have us discount all those decisions
rendered before 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure were adopted, because it says that before the
promulgation of the Rules, "[p]urely procedural impediments" somehow blocked the exercise of a constitutional
right. In itself this would seem a rather shaky premise
upon which to build an argument. But the Court's position is still further weakened by the fact that any
"[p]urely procedural impediments" to a jury trial in a
derivative suit were eliminated, not in 1938, but at least
as early as 1912. For Rule 23 of the Equity Rules of
that year provided that if a "matter ordinarily determinable at law" arose in an equity suit it should "be
determined in that suit according to the principles applicable, without sending the case or question to the

law side of the court." 226 U. S. 654. These applicable
principles included the right of jury trial.' Consequently,
when the Court said in United Copper Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co., 244 U. S.261, 264, that "it is clear"
that the remedy of a stockholder seeking to enforce the
rights of a corporation-whatever their nature-is not in
law but in equity, it was not because there were "procedural impediments" to a jury trial on any "legal issues."
Rather, it was because the suit itself was conceived of
as a wholly equitable cause of action.
This was also true in Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street
Lighting Co., 240 U. S. 27, on which the Court so
heavily relies even though it was a pre-Federal-Rules
case. In Fleitmann the plaintiff sued derivatively to enforce a corporate right of action for treble damages under
the antitrust laws. Treble damages were considered
punitive, and the statute was read to imply a right in
the defendant to a jury trial. In his opinion for the
Court, Mr. Justice Holmes recognized the potential for
abuse: derivative rather than corporate actions could be
brought in order to deprive the defendant of his right
to a jury trial. The Court's solution was to dismiss the
bill because the antitrust statute "should not be read as
attempting to authorize liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of
common law." Id., at 29. I do not see how the Court
today can draw sustenance from this decision. Rather,
the Fleitmann case seems to me to stand for a proposition diametrically opposed to that which the Court seeks
to establish, namely, the proposition that because a
derivative action is wholly equitable, there is no right to
a jury trial. The Court in Fleitmann simply held that
since there was a statutory right to a jury in all actions
for treble damages under the antitrust laws, a derivative

suit seeking such damages could not be maintained.
Thus the bill had to be dismissed.""
These pre-1938 cases, then, firmly establish the unitary, equitable basis of shareholders' derivative suits and
in no way support the Court's holding here. But, the
Court says, whatever the situation may have been before 1938, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of that
year, at least as construed in our decisions more than
20 years later in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359
U. S. 500, and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S.
469, in any event require the conclusion reached today.
I can find nothing in either of these cases that leads
to that conclusion.
In Beacon Theatres the plaintiff sought both an injunction preventing the defendant from instituting an
antitrust action and a declaratory judgment that certain
moving picture distribution contracts did not violate the
antitrust laws. The defendant answered and counterclaimed for treble damages under the antitrust laws.
He demanded a jury trial on the factual issues relating
to his counterclaim. The district court held that even
though there were factual issues common to both the
complaint and the counterclaim, it would first hear the
plaintiff's suit for equitable relief before submitting the
counterclaim to a jury. The Court of Appeals affirmed,
and this Court reversed, upon the ground that if the
equitable claim were tried first, there might be an estoppel which would defeat the defendant's right to a full
jury trial on all the factual issues raised in his counterclaim. Similarly in Dairy Queen the Court simply held
10 Moreover, since the suit was brought after the promulgation
of Equity Rulc 23 it seems evident that here, too, it was not merely
"procedural impediments" that prevented the antitrust claim from
being tried to a jury, but presumably the fact that no matter arising
in a derivative suit-whatever its "inherent nature"-was considered
to be one "ordinarily determinable at law."

that a plaintiff could not avoid a jury trial by joining
legal and equitable causes of action in one complaint.
It is true that in Beacon Theatres it was stated that the
1938 Rules did diminish the scope of federal equity jurisdiction in certain particulars. But the Court's effort to
force the facts of this case into the mold of Beacon
Theatres and Dairy Queen simply does not succeed.
Those cases involved a combination of historically separable suits, one in law and one in equity. Their facts
fit the pattern of cases where, before the Rules, the equity
court would have disposed of the equitable claim and
would then have either retained jurisdiction over the
suit, despite the availability of adequate legal remedies,
or enjoined a subsequent legal action between the same
parties involving the same controversy.1 1
But the present case is not one involving traditionally
equitable claims by one party, and traditionally legal
claims by the other. Nor is it a suit in which the
plaintiff is asserting a combination of legal and equitable
claims. For, as we have seen, a derivative suit has
always been conceived of as a single, unitary, equitable
cause of action. It is for this reason, and not because of "procedural impediments," that the courts of
equity did not transfer derivative suits to the law side.
In short, the cause of action is wholly a creature of equity.
And whatever else can be said of Beacon Theatres and
Dairy Queen, they did not cast aside altogether the
historic division between equity and law.
If history is to be so cavalierly dismissed, the derivative
suit can, of course, be artificially broken down into separable elements. But so then can any traditionally
equitable cause of action, and the logic of the Court's
position would lead to the virtual elimination of all equity
jurisdiction. An equitable suit for an injunction, for

instance, often involves issues of fact which, if damages
had been sought, would have been triable to a jury.
Does this mean that in a suit asking only for injunctive
relief these factual issues must be tried to the jury, with
the judge left to decide only whether, given the jury's
findings, an injunction is the appropriate remedy? Certainly the Federal Rules make it possible to try a suit for
an injunction in that way, but even more certainly they
were not intended to have any such effect. Yet the
Court's approach, it seems, would require that if any
"legal issue" procedurally could be tried to a jury, it
constitutionally must be tried to a jury.
The fact is, of course, that there are, for the most
part, no such things as inherently "legal issues" or inherently "equitable issues." There are only factual
issues, and, "like chameleons [they] take their color from
surrounding circumstances." 12 Thus the Court's "nature
of the issue" approach is hardly meaningful.
As a final ground for its conclusion, the Court points
to a supposed analogy to suits involving class actions.
It says that before the Federal Rules such suits were
considered equitable and not triable to a jury, but that
since promulgation of the Rules the federal courts have
found that "plaintiffs may obtain a jury trial on any
legal issues they present." Of course the plaintiff may
obtain such a trial even in a derivative suit. Nothing
in the Constitution or the Rules precludes the judge
from granting a jury trial as a matter of discretion.
As Professor Moore has put it,
12 James, supra, n. 1, at 692.
"Whether issues are legal or equitable may, of course, depend upon
the manner in which they are presented ... ." 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice 38.04 [1], n. 40. And he, along with virtually every
other commentator, concludes that if the issues are presented in a
shareholder's derivative suit they are equitable and the plaintiff has
no constitutional right to have them tried by a jury. 5 J. Moore,

But even if the Court means that some federal courts
have ruled that the class action plaintiff in some situations has a constitutional right to a jury trial, the
analogy to derivative suits is wholly unpersuasive. For
it is clear that the draftsmen of the Federal Rules intended that Rule 23 as it pertained to class actions should
be applicable, like other rules governing joinder of claims
and parties, "to all actions, whether formerly denominated legal or equitable." 1 This does not mean that
a formerly equitable action is triable to a jury simply
because it is brought on behalf of a class, but only that
a historically legal cause of action can be tried to a
jury even if it is brought as a class action. Since a
derivative suit is historically wholly a creation of equity,
the class action "analogy" is in truth no analogy at all.
The Court's decision today can perhaps be explained
as a reflection of an unarticulated but apparently overpowering bias in favor of jury trials in civil actions. It
certainly cannot be explained in terms of either the Federal Rules or the Constitution.

Professor Moore points out, certain class actions could be maintained at law in the federal courts even before the Federal Rules.
