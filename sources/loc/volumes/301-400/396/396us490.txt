FLORIDA v. ALABAMA

396 U. S.
ET AL.

ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE BILL OF COMPLAINT

No. 37, Orig. Decided January 28, 1970
State of Florida's motion for leave to file complaint invoking Court's
original jurisdiction fails to state claim warranting exercise of such
jurisdiction.
Motion denied.

Claude R. Kirk, Jr., Governor of Florida, and Gerald
Mager on the motion.
PER CURIAM.

On January 23, 1970, the plaintiff filed a motion for
leave to file a complaint invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court naming 49 other States and Robert
Finch, as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, as parties defendant.
The alleged emergent nature of the claims for relief
led the Court to give expedited consideration to the
motion and proffered complaint and, having examined

the complaint, we conclude it fails to state a claim against
any of the defendants warranting the exercise of the
original jurisdiction of this Court.
Accordingly, the motion to accelerate the time for
responses to the proffered complaint and the motion for
leave to file the proffered complaint are denied.
