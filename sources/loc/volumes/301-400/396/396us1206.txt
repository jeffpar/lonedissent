SCAGGS v. LARSEN, COMMANDING
GENERAL, 'r AL.
ON MOTION FOR STAY

Decided August 5, 1969
Motion by Army reservist for release from military custody pending
Court of Appeals' review of District Court's denial of petition for
habeas corpus is granted. Reservist's claims that the order requiring him to serve 17 months beyond his enlistment contract
was without notice and opportunity to be heard, and in violation
of the terms of his enlistment contract, are within the scope of
the writ of habeas corpus. There is no statutory provision for
a hearing, and the issue is substantial and should be resolved.
Lloyd E. MeMurray on the motion.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGIAS,

Circuit Justice.

This is a phase of review of the action of respondents
in ordering movant to active duty in the United States
Army Reserve for a period of approximately 17 months
beyond the term of his enlistment contract. His enlistment expires in September 1969. He was directed in
January 1969 to join a unit of the Ready Reserve and
attend regular drills. If his allegations are to be believed, he made a diligent effort to comply but was rejected, since his enlistment period would expire in
September 1969. Up until that time he had met all the
requirements of the Army Ready Reserve. He claims
that the order thereafter entered requiring him to serve
about 17 months beyond the end of his enlistment
contract was punitive and unauthorized.
He therefore filed a petition for habeas corpus with
the District Court, complaining that the crucial step
taken when he was ordered to active duty was taken
without notice and an opportunity to be heard in viola-

tion of procedural due process and also was in violation
of the terms of his enlistment contract. The District
Court denied the petition, and that decision is presently
awaiting review by the Court of Appeals. Scaggs seeks
by this motion release from military custody pending
that review.
He rests on 28 U. S. C. § 2241 1to support his claim that

the District Court has jurisdiction of the habeas corpus
action.
It has been argued in other cases that the word "custody" indicates that § 2241 does not reach cases where

military authority is being contested by civilians at a
pre-induction stage 2 or by servicemen not yet convicted
of an offense who entered the Armed Forces "volun"(a) Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme
Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge
within their respective jurisdictions ...
"(c) The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner
unless-"(1) He is in custody under or by color of the authority of the
United States or is committed for trial before some court thereof; or
"(2) He is in custody for an act done or omitted in pursuance
of an Act of Congress, or an order, process, judgment or decree
of a court or judge of the United States; or
"(3) He is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws
or treaties of the United States ...."
2 With the apparent lone exception of Ez parte Fabiani, 105 F.
Supp. 139, the federal courts have held that habeas corpus is not
available prior to induction. See, e. g., DeRozario v. Commanding
Officer, 390 F. 2d 532; Lynch v. Hershey, 93 U. S. App. D. C. 177,
208 F. 2d 523, cert. denied, 347 U. S. 917; Petersen v. Clark, 285
F. Supp. 700. Pre-induction judicial review is more frequently
sought by way of injunction, mandamus, or declaratory judgment.
See Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., 393 U. S. 233; Wolff v.
Selective Service Bd., 372 F. 2d 817; Townsend v. Zimmerman, 237
F. 2d 376.

tarily." ' I take the opposed view, though the question
has not been authoritatively decided. However that may
be, § 2241 is not a measure of the constitutional scope of
the guarantee in Art. I, § 9, of the Constitution that:
"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not
be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."
The Great Writ was designed to protect every person
from being detained, restrained, or confined by any
branch or agency of government. In these days it serves
no higher function than when the Selective Service
Boards (Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., 393 U. S.
233) or the military act lawlessly. I conclude, in other
words, that in spite of the prejudice that exists against
review by civilian courts of military action, habeas
corpus is in the tradition of Oestereich wherever lawless
or unconstitutional action is alleged.
S It is settled that illegal induction is properly attacked by a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Oestereich v. Selective Service Bd., supra. The remaining debate concerns cases challenging
the legality of continued military service that has been entered
under a contract of enlistment. Cases denying jurisdiction to issue
a writ of habeas corpus where the petitioner enlisted in the military
forces include Fox v. Brown, 402 F. 2d 837; United States ex rel.
McKiever v. Jack, 351 F. 2d 672; MeCord v. Page, 124 F. 2d 68;
In re Green, 156 F. Supp. 174. Others upholding such jurisdiction
are Hammond v. Lenfest, 398 F. 2d 705; Crane v. Hedrick, 284 F.
Supp. 250; cf. Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236, 240; Orloff v.
Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94; Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397. In
United States ex tel. Schonbrun v. Commanding Officer, 403 F. 2d
371, the petitioner, a member of the Army Reserve, sought exemption
from active duty on the basis of personal hardship. Although the
court held that "[a]n inquiry into the legality of this restraint would
be within the traditional function of the writ," id., at 373, it further
held that "[w]hether or not habeas corpus is available, the district
court was free to treat the petition as one for mandamus under
28 U. S. C. § 1361." Id., at 374.

Opinion in Chambers

As stated, the gravamen of the complaint in this case
is that the critical steps forcing petitioner to serve beyond
his enlistment contract were taken without notice and
opportunity on his part to be heard. The statute makes
no provision for a hearing. Neither did the statute in
Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, authorizing
the deportation of aliens. But the Court said that constitutional requirements made a hearing necessary.
Neither deportation nor a military order to active duty
is in form penal. But the requirement that a man serve
beyond his enlistment contract may be as severe in nature
as expulsion from these shores. At least the issue presented is substantial and should be resolved.
It is hereby ordered that petitioner be, and he is
hereby, released on his own recognizance from any and
all custody of the United States Army or the United
States Army Reserve, and from compliance with the
orders heretofore issued, requiring that he report for
active duty at Fort Ord, California, on July 27, 1969.
This order shall remain in effect until a determination
of the cause on the merits by the Court of Appeals.
