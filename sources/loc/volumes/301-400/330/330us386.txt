CERTIORARI TO THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR PROVIDENCE AND
BRISTOL COUNTIES, RHODE ISLAND.

No. 431.

Argued February 14, 1947.-Deeided March 10, 1947.

Section 205 (e) of the Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 34,
as amended, provides that a buyer of goods at above the ceiling
price may sue the seller "in any court of competent jurisdiction"
for three times the amount of the overcharge plus costs and a reasonable attorney's fee; and § 205 (c) provides that the federal
district courts shall have jurisdiction of such suits "concurrently
with" state courts. Having purchased an automobile at above the
ceiling price, the purchaser sued the seller under § 205 (e) and
obtained judgment for damages and costs in a state court having
adequate general jurisdiction to enforce similar claims arising under
state law. On appeal, the State Supreme Court reversed the judgment on the ground that the suit was for a penalty based on a
statute of a foreign sovereign and could not be maintained in the
state courts. Held: Assuming, without deciding, that § 205 (e) is
a penal statute, the state courts were not free under Article VI
of the Constitution to refuse enforcement of the claim. Claflin

purchaser of an automobile at above the ceiling price a
judgment for damages and costs under § 205 (e) of the
Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 34, as amended.

The State Supreme Court reversed and, pursuant to local
practice, remitted the case and record to the Superior

Section 205 (e)l of the Emergency Price Control Act
provides that a buyer of goods at above the prescribed
ceiling price may sue the seller "in any court of competent
jurisdiction" for not more than three times the amount
of the overcharge plus costs and a reasonable attorney's
fee. Section 205 (c) 2 provides that federal district courts
shall have jurisdiction of such suits "concurrently with
State and Territorial courts." Such a suit under § 205 (e)
must be brought "in the district or county in which the
defendant resides or has a place of business .
The respondent was in the automobile business in
Providence, Providence County, Rhode Island. In 1944
he sold an automobile to petitioner Testa, who also resides

in Providence, for $1100, $210 above the ceiling price.
The petitioner later filed this suit against respondent in
the State District Court in Providence. Recovery was
sought under § 205 (e). The court awarded a judgment
of treble damages and costs to petitioner. On appeal to
the State Superior Court, where the trial was de novo, the
petitioner was again awarded judgment, but only for the
amount of the overcharge plus attorney's fees. Pending
appeal from this judgment, the Price Administrator was
allowed to intervene. On appeal, the State Supreme
Court reversed, 71 R. I. 472, 47 A. 2d 312. It interpreted
§ 205 (e) to be "a penal statute in the international sense."
It held that an action for violation of § 205 (e) could not
be maintained in the courts of that State. The State
Supreme Court rested its holding on its earlier decision
in Robinson v. Norato, 71 R. I. 256, 43 A. 2d 467 (1945) in
which it had reasoncAi that: A state.need not enforce the
penal laws of a government which is foreign in the international sense; § 205 (e) is treated by Rhode Island as
penal in that sense; the United States ir "foreign" to the
State in the "private international" as distinguished from
the "public international" sense; hence Rhode Island
courts, though their jurisdiction is adequate to enforce
similar Rhode Island "penal" statutes, need not enforce
§ 205 (e). Whether state courts may decline to enforce
federal laws on these -grounds is a question of great importance. For this reason, and because the Rhodet Island
Supreme Court's holding was alleged to conflict with this
Court's previous holding in Mondou v. New York, N. H. &
H: R. Co., 223 U. S. 1, we granted certiorari. 329 U. S.

8 Pursuant to Rhode Island practice, the State Supreme Court
remitted the case and the record to the Superior Court. That court
then entered judgment in accordance ,with the Supreme Court's

TESTA v. KATT.
386

Opinion of the Court.

For the purposes of this case, we assume, without deciding, that § 205 (e) is a penal statute in the "public international," "private international," or any other sense.
So far as the question of whether the Rhode Island
courts properly declined to try this action, it makes no
difference into which of these categories the Rhode Island
court chose to place the statute which Congress has passed.
For we cannot accept the basic premise on which the
Rhode Island Supreme Court held that it has no more
obligation to enforce a valid penal law of the United
States than it has to enforce a penal law of another state
or a foreign country. Such a broad assumption flies in
the face of the fact that the States of the Union constitute
a nation. It disregards the purpose and effect of Article
VI of the Constitution which provides: "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be
be made in Pursuance thereof;. and all Treaties made, er
which shall be made, under the Authority of. the United
States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the
Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing
in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding."
It cannot be assumed, the. supremacy. clause considered, that the responsibilities of a state to enforce the
laws of a sister state are identical with its responsibilities
to enforce federal laws. Such an assumption represents
an erroneous evaluation of the statutes of Congress and
thd prior decisions of this Court in their historic setting.
Those decisions establish that state courts do not bear the
same relation to the United States that they do to foreign
countries. The first Congress that convened after the
Constitution was adopted conferred jurisdiction upon the
opinion. It is the judgment of the Superior Court which petitioner
asked us to review on certiorari. See Joslin Co. v. Providence, 462
U. S. 668, 673.

state courts to enforce important federal civil laws,' and
succeeding Congresses conferred on the states jurisdiction over federal crimes and actions for penalties and
forfeitures.5
Enforcement of federal laws by state courts did not
go unchallenged. Violent public controversies existed
throughout the first part of the Nineteenth Century until
the 1860's concerning the extent of the constitutional supremacy of the Federal Government. During that period
there were instances in which this Court and state courts
broadly questioned the power and duty of state courts

to exercise their jurisdiction to enforce United States civil
and penal statutes or the power of the Federal Government to require them to do so. 6 But after the fundamental issues over the extent of federal supremacy had
been resolved by war, this Court took occasion in 1876 to
review the phase of the controversy concerning the relationship of state courts. to the Federal Government.
Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130. The opinion of a
unanimous court in that case was strongly buttressed by

historic references and persuasive reasoning.

ated the assumption that federal laws can be considered
by the states as though they were laws emanating from
a foreign sovereign. Its teaching is that the Constitution
and the laws passed pursuant to it are the supreme laws
of the land, binding alike upon states, courts, and the
people, "any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any
State to the Contrary notwithstanding."'
It asserted
that the obligation of states to enforce these federal laws
is not lessened by reason of the form in which they are
cast or the remedy which they provide. And the Court
stated that "If an act of Congress gives a penalty to a
party aggrieved, without specifying a remedy for its enforcement, there is no reason why it should not be enforced, if not provided otherwise by some act of Congress,
by a proper action in a State court." Id. at 137. And
see United States v. Bank of New York, 296 U. S. 463,
479.
The Claflin opinion thus answered most of the arguments theretofore advanced against the power and duty
of state courts to enforce federal penal laws. And since
that decision, the remaining areas of doubt have been
steadily narrowed.8 There have been statements in cases
concerned with the obligation of states to give full faith
and credit to the proceedings of sister states which suggested a theory contrary to that pronounced in the Claflin
opinion.' But when in Mondou v. New York, N. H. &
H. R. Cd., 223 U. S. 1, thia Court was presented with a case

testing the power and duty of states to enforce federal
laws, it found the solution in - the broad principles
announced in the Claflin opinion.
The precise question in the Mondou case was whether
rights arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act,
36 Stat. 291, could "be enforced, as of right, in the courts
of the States when their jurisdiction, as fixed by local laws,
is adequate to the occasion . . ." Id. at 46. The Supreme Court of Connecticut had decided that they could
not. Except for the penalty feature, the factors it considered and its reasoning were strikingly similar to that on
which the Rhode Island Supreme Court declined to enforce the federal law here involved. But this Court held
that the Connecticut court could not decline to entertain
the actioh. The contention that enforcement of the congressionally created right was contrary to Connecticut
policy was answered as follows:
"The suggestion that the act of Congress is not in
harmony with the policy of the State, and therefore
that the courts of the State are free to decline jurisdiction, is quite inadmissible, because it presupposes
what in legal contemplation does not exist. When
Congress, in the exertion of the power confided to it
by the Constitution, adopted that act, it spoke for all
the people and all the States, and thereby established
a policy for all. That policy is as much the policy
of Connecticut as if the act had emanated from its
own legislature, and should be respected accordingly
in the courts of the State." Mondou v. New York,
N. H. & H. R. Co., supraat 57.
So here, the fact that Rhode Island has an established
policy against enforcement by its courts of statutes of
other states and the United States which it deems penal,
cannot be accepted as a "valid excuse." Cf. Douglas v.

TESTA v. KATT.
386

Opinion of the Court.

New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377, 388.10 For the
policy of the federal Act is the prevailing policy in every
state. Thus, in a case which chiefly relied upon the
Claflin and Mondou precedents, this Court stated that a
state court cannot "refuse to enforce the right arising from
the law of the United States because of conceptions of impolicy or want of wisdom on the part of Congress in having
called into play its lawful powers." Minneapolis & St. L.
R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211,222.
The Rhode Island court in its Robinson decision, on
which it relies, cites cases of this Court which have
held that states are not required by the full faith and
credit clause of the Constitution to enforce judgments
of the courts of other states based on claims arising out of
penal statutes." But those holdings have no relevance
here, for this case raises no full faith and credit question.
Nor need we consider in this case prior decisions to the
effect that federal courts are not required to enforce state
penal laws. Compare Wisconsin v. Pelican Ins. Co., 127
U. S. 265, with Massachusettsv. Missouri, 308 U. S. 1, 20.
10It

has been observed that the historic origin of the concept first
expressed in this country by Chief Justice Marshall in The Antelope,
10 Wheat. 66, 123, that "The courts of no country execute the penal
laws of another . . ." lies in an earlier English case, Folliott v. Ogden,

1 H. Bl. 124 (1789), aff'd., Ogden v. Folliott, 3 T. R. 726 (1790), 4
Bro. P. C. 111. In that case the English courts refused to enforce an
American Revolutionary statute confiscating property of loyal British
subjects on the ground that English courts must refuse to enforce such
penal statutes of a foreign enemy. It has been observed of this case
that "of course they. could as well have spoken of local public policy, and have reached the same result as surely." Leflar, Extrastate
Enforcement of Penal and Governmental Claims, 46 Harv. L. Rev.
193, 195 (1932). See Griffin v. McCoach, 313 U.- S. 498; cf. Hines v.
Lowrey, 305 U. S. 85.

OCTOBER TERM, 1946.
Opinion of the Court.

330 U. S.

For whatever consideration they may be entitled to in
the field in which they are relevant, those decisions did not
bring before us our instant problem of the effect of the
supremacy clause on the relation of federal laws to state
courts. Our question concerns only the right of a state
to deny enforcement to claims growing out of a valid
federal law.
It is conceded that this same type of claim arising under
Rhode Island law would be enforced bythat State's courts.
Its courts have enforced claims for double damages growing out of the Fair Labor Standards Act."2 Thus the
Rhode Island courts have jurisdiction adequate and appropriate under established local law to adjudicate this
action."3 Under these circumstances the State courts are
not free to refuse enforcement of petitioners' claim., See
McKnett v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co., 292 U. S. 230; and
compare Herb v. Pitcairn,324 U. S. 117; 325 U. S. 77. The
case is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
