CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH DAKOTA.

No. 417.

Argued February 5, 1947.-Decided March 17, 1947.

1. Under R. S. § 3466, which provides that "whenever the estate
of any deceased debtor . . . is insufficient to pay all the debts due
from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be
first satisfied," a claim asserted in a state probate proceeding by
an official of the Farm Credit Administration for and on behalf

crop loans made pursuant to the Acts of February 23 and June 19,
1934, is entitled to priority. Pp. 541-545.
2. A debt owed the Farm Credit Administration is a debt owed the
United States within the meaning of R. S. § 3466. Pp. 541-542.
3. The priority given by R. S. § 3466 to debts due to the United
States is unaffected by the fact that a claim based upon such a debt
is filed in the name of an agency of the United States or an authorized officer of such an agency. Pp. 542-543.
4. There is no irreconcilable conflict between making emergency
loans to distressed farmers and granting priority to the collection
of such loans pursuant to R. S. § 3466. Pp. 543-545.
5. Only the plainest inconsistency would warrant an implied exception to the priority established by R. S. § 3466. Pp. 544-545.

MURPHY,

an-

We are faced here with the problem of whether, in a
state probate proceeding, a claim asserted by the Farm
Credit Administration through certain of its officials for
and on behalf of the United States is entitled to priority
under § 3466 of the Revised Statutes, 31 U. S. C. § 191.
The Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, pursuant to the Acts of February 23, 1934,1 and June 19, 1934,2
extended emergency feed and crop loans totalling $370.00
to Wilhelm Buttke, a South Dakota farmer. Most of
these loans remained unpaid. On December 26, 1941,
Buttke died intestate, leaving an estate insufficient to
pay all of his debts. Respondent was appointed administrator of the estate. On March 2, 1942, an authorized
agent of the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration
filed in the County Court of Roberts County, South
Dakota, a claim against the estate for $523.80, the amount
of the unpaid indebtedness plus interest. This claim was
made "for and on behalf of the United States of America"
and a priority therefor on behalf of the United States was
asserted under § 3466 of the Revised Statutes.
The County Court denied preference to this claim.
But it did allow the claim in the amount of $79.53, which
represented the pro rata share of a common creditor's
claim. This decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of
the Fifth Judicial Circuit of South Dakota and by the
Supreme Court of South Dakota. 70 S. D. -, 23 N. W.

Opinion of the Court.

2d 281. The latter court felt that the Acts of February
23, 1934, and June 19, 1934, creatnd an exception to § 3466
and that the claimed priority should accordingly be refused
on the authority of United States v. Guaranty Trust Co.,
280 U. S. 478. We granted certiorari because of the
important problems thereby raised.
The relevant portion of § 3466 of the Revised Statutes
provides that ". . . whenever the estate of any deceased,
debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators,
is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first
satisfied ...
"
Initially, it is suggested that § 3466 is inapplicable since
the claim in issue is not a debt due to the United States.
The claim grows out of the seven notes executed by the
deceased to "the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, or order, at Washington, D. C." These notes
stated that they were "given as evidence of a loan made
by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration."
On the premise that the Farm Credit Administration is
an entity separate and distinct from the United States
Government, the argument is made that obligations due
the Farm Credit Administration fall outside the priority
established by § 3466. We cannot agree.
The Farm Credit Administration is plainly one of the
many administrative units of the United States Government, established to carry out the functions delegated
to it by Congress. It bears none of the features of a government corporation with a legal entity separate from
that of the United States, whatever difference that might
make as to the application of § 3466. Cf. Sloan Shipyards
Corp. v. United States Fleet Corp., 258 U. S. 549. It had
its inception in 1933,as an independent agency, assuming
the functions of the Federal Farm Board and the Federal
Farm Loan Board. Executive Order No. 6084. In 1939,

it was transferred to the Department of Agriculture and
placed under the general supervision and direction of the
Secretary of Agriculture. Reorganization Plan No. 1,
§ 401 (a), 53 Stat. 1429, 4 Fed. Reg. 2730. Its functions,
personnel and property were then consolidated in 1942
with those of certain other agencies to form the Food Production Administration of the Department of Agriculture. Executive Order No. 9280, 7 Fed. Reg. 10179. At
no time has the Farm Credit Administration been other
than an unincorporated agency of the United States Government, administering and lending funds appropriated
by Congress out of the United States Treasury and returning the money to the Treasury upon repayment. In
short, it is an integral part of the governmental mechanism. And the use of a name other than that of the
United States cannot change that fact. United States
v. Fontenot, 33 F. Supp. 629; In re Wilson, 23 F. Supp.
236; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallasv. Smylie, (Tex. Civ.
App.) 134 S. W. 2d 838; Helms v. Emergency Crop & Seed
Loan Office, 216 N. C. 581, 5 S. E. 2d 822. See also North
Dakota-MontanaWheat Growers' Assn. v. United States,
66 F. 2d 573.. Hence. any debt owed the Farm Credit Administration is a debt owed the United States within the
meaning of § 3466.
Moreover, the priority given by § 3466 to a debt due
to the United States is unaffected by the fact that a claim
based upon that debt is filed in the name of an agency
of the United States or an authorized officer of such an
agency. It is enough that there is an obligation owed
the United States. Whether the claim is filed in the name
of the United States or in the name of an officer or agency
is immaterial; in the latter instance, the claim is necessarily filed on behalf of the United States and the legal
effect is the same as if it had been filed in that name.
Nothing in the language or policy of § 3466 justifies any
other conclusion. It follows that the method of filing in

this case cannot be questioned. The claim was filed in
the name of the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration "for and on behalf of the United States of America"an explicit recognition of the legal realities involved.
The main contention, however, is that the purpose of
the statutes under which the loans were made is inconsistent with § 3466, thereby rendering it inapplicable.
The Acts of February 23, 1934, and June 19, 1934, authorized feed and crop loans to farmers in drought and stormstricken areas of the nation. It is said that the prime
purpose of these Acts was to restore the credit of the
farmers and that to give effect to § 3466 would impair that
credit. Reliance is placed upon United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., supra. This Court there held that § 3166
was inapplicable to the collection of loans made by the
Government to railroad carriers to rehabilitate and maintain their credit status; it was felt that to give priority
under such circumstances would defeat the purpose of the
legislation by impairing the credit of the railroads. See
also Cook County National Bank v. United States, 107
U. S.445.
But it is manifest that the purpose of the Acts of
February 23, 1934, and June 19, 1934, was to give emergency relief to distressed farmers rather than to restore
their credit status. These were but two of a series of
emergency feed and crop loan statutes' enacted at various
times from 1921 to 1938, a period when farmers were the
victims of repeated crop failures and adverse economic
conditions. Their credit was often impaired, but their
most urgent need was for money to purchase feed and to
plant crops; without- such money, distress and unemploy841 Stat. 1347; 42 Stat. 467; 43 Stat. 110; 44 Stat. 1245, 1251;

ment might have been their lot. It was to meet that
urgent need that Congress passed these statutes.
More specifically, the two Acts under consideration were

designed to make loans available to those farmers who
were unable to secure credit from the Production Credit
Associations, organized pursuant to the Farm Credit Act
of 1933.' It was recognized that many farmers could
not qualify for loans from those Associations. Some
method of lending aid and assistance to those who had no
credit and no money with which to buy feed for their
livestock and seeds for their crops was essential in the
absence of a more direct form of Government relief.
S. Rep. 148, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; H. Rep. 521, 73d Cong.,
2d Sess. As was said by Representative Kerr, "Let it
be remembered that the Government is not seeking to
make an investment; this is simply an endeavor to finance
the farmers of this country who are utterly unable to
finance themselves." 78 Cong. Rec. 1959. See United
States v. Thomas, 107 F. 2d 765, 766; Person v. United
States, 112 F. 2d 1, 2.
We conclude that there is no irreconcilable conflict between giving emergency loans to distressed farmers and
giving priority to the collection of these loans pursuant
to § 3466. Such priority could in no way impair the aid
which the farmers sought through these loans; nor could
it embarrass the farmers in their daily operations. Moreover, these loans called for a first lien on crops growing
or to be grown, or on livestock. The conditions prevailing in 1934 made this type of security uncertain and
there is no indication that Congress meant such a lien
to be the sole security to which the Government could
look for repayment.
We reiterate what :'vas said in United States v. Emory,
314 U. S. 423, 433: "Only the plainest inconsistency
' 48 Stat. 257.

would warrant our finding an implied exception to the
operation of so clear a command as that of § 3466." In
this case, as in that, we think such inconsistency is wholly
wanting. United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., supra,
is therefore inapposite.
Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS would affirm the judgment on
the authority of United States v. Guaranty Trust Co., 280
U. S. 478.

v. GENERAL INDUSTRIES CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 564.

Argued February 10, 11, 1947.-Decided March 31, 1947.

1. In a suit by the Wage-Hour Administrator to enjoin alleged violations of the overtime compensation requirement of § 7 of the Fair
Labor Standards Act, the evidence summarized in the opinion held
adequate to support a finding by the district court that certain
"operating engineers" who had charge of a power plant in the
absence of the chief engineer, supervised the work of firemen and
coal passers, received monthly salaries in excess of $200, and enjoyed privileges usually reserved for supervisory employees, were,
exempted by § 13 (a) as employees employed in an "executive"
capacity. Pp. 547-550.
2. Where findings of fact made by a district court on conflicting
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom are not clearly wrong,
they should not be rejected by a circuit court of appeals. P. 550.
3. Upon review of a judgment of a circuit court of appeals on certiorari, the respondent, without filing a cross-petition for certiorari,
may seek-to sustain the judgment on a ground which the circuit
court of appeals rejected as well as upon that which it accepted.
P. 547, n. 5.
155 F. 2d 711, affirmed.
