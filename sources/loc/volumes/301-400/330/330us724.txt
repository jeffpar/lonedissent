UNITED STATES v. LEM HOY.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.

No. 585. Argued March 14, 1947.-Decided April 7, 1947.
1. Section 5 (g) of the Farm Labor Supply Appropriation Act of
1944 does not except agricultural laborers from the provision of
§ 5 of the Immigration Act of 1917 making it a criminal offense
to induce to migrate to the United States as contract laborers aliens
who are not entitled to enter the United States under the 1917
Act or any other law of the United States. Pp. 730-731.
2. Since dismissal of the information in this case was based on the
construction of the 1917 Act as the Government sought to apply
it in the information, the case was properly brought to this Court
on direct appeal from the district court.. P. 725.
Reversed.

A United States District Court dismissed an information charging a violation of § 5 of the Immigration Act

of 1917, 39 Stat. 874, by inducing aliens to migrate to
the United States as contract laborers--on the ground
that § 5 (g) of the Farm Labor Supply Appropriation Act
of 1944, 58 Stat. 11, excepts agricultural laborers from
the provisions of the 1917 Act. On direct appeal to this
Court, reversed, p. 731.
Peyton Ford argued the cause for the United States.
With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General
Washington, Robert S. Erdahl and Sheldon E. Bernstein.

A United States Attorney filed an information in a
Federal District Court charging that the appellee, Lem
Hoy, "did attempt to induce, assist, encourage, and solicit,

certain alien persons to migrate to the United States as
contract laborers . . . who were not alien contract laborers duly entitled to migrate to the United States under the
Act of February 5, 1917, or to enter or migrate to the
United States under any other law of the United States,
as the defendant then and there well knew." The conduct
charged was made an offense by § 5 of the 1917 Immigration Act referred to in the information. 39 Stat. 874,
879, 8 U. S. C. § 139. Hoy appeared, waived indictment,
asked for a bill of particulars, and moved to dismiss the
information on the ground that § 5 of the 1917 Act had
been repealed by § 5 (g) of the Farm Labor Supply Appropriation Act of 1944. 58 Stat. 11, 15-16, 50 U. S. C.
App., Supp. V, § 1355 (g). The bill of particulars showed
that Hoy had written a letter to certain persons living in
Mexico to induce them to come to the United States to
work for him. In the letter Hoy told them that "it makes
no difference if you pass as contraband (smuggle in), as
wherever the Immigration catches you I will get you out
with a bond." The letter also directed the aliens to see
a man near the border who would "bring" them to Hoy for
$25, and stated that Hoy would "arrange everything."
It was stipulated that Hoy wanted the men to work for
him as agricultural laborers.
Holding that the 1944 Farm Labor Act had made the
1917 Act. inapplicable to such farm laborers, and therefore to those who induced their entry, the District Court
dismissed the information. Since this dismissal was based
on the construction of the 1917 Act as the Government
sought to apply it in the information, the case is properly
here on direct appeal from the District Court. 18 U. S. C.

agricultural laborers from North, South, and Central
America, and islands adjacent thereto. In determining
whether this information was properly dismissed, it is
appropriate for us to consider whether Congress intended
in the 1944 Act to remove all restrictions, enforceable by
sanctions, against immigration into the United States of
such agricultural laborers from the western hemisphere;
and at the same time whether it intended to repeal, not
only the provision which prohibited contract laborers
from entering the country, but also the long-standing
law which made it a criminal offense to induce such persons, barred by law, to enter.1 If the 1944 Act has these
effects, it marks a complete reversal of the congressional
policy which has been followed for more than half a
century.2
In line with this policy, the purpose of the 1917 Act,
according to its title, was "To regulate the immigration
of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the United
States." It provided detailed qualifications for persons
to be admitted to the country. Certain persons were to be
completely barred, such as idiots, epileptics, chronic alcoholics, vagrants, criminals, polygamists, prostitutes, persons afflicted with loathsome or dangerous contagious
diseases, persons who advise, advocate, or teach opposition
to organized government or its overthrow by force, illitCompare 39 Stat. 894, 8 U. S. C. § 163 (crime to aid or assist any
person to enter who believes in violent overthrow of government);
39 Stat. 880, 43 Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. § 145 (crime to bring to the United
States an alien with certain diseases); 45 Stat. 1551, 8 U. S. C. § 180a
(crime for alien to enter at any place other than at an immigration
point, or to elude examination). See also 35 Stat. 1152, 18 U. S. C.
§ 550 which provides that "Whoever directly commits .

erates, and contract laborers, defined as persons induced or encouraged to come to this country by offers
or promises Of employment. The 1917 Act further
provided for deportation of improperly admitted aliens,
and authorized the promulgation of regulations to enforce
the various provisiohs looking to exclusion of all persons
except those qualified to enter the United States under
the prescribed statutory standards. Pursuant to the
broad terms of the 1917 and other supplementary Acts, a
bureau of immigration and naturalization, now a part of
the Department of Justice, has been established to examine the qualifications of those seeking admission and
otherwise to enforce and administer the immigration laws
in the interior and at the borders.'
The 1944 Farm Labor Act does not on its face purport
to relax the standards of the 1917 and other Acts, except in
a very limited way. It does not abolish the screening,
administrative and enforcement function of the immigration authorities. Indeed the sponsor of the bill on the
Senate floor explained that the measure proposed made
certain, by provision for strict control of immigration and
immigrants, that the stay of workers admitted pursuant
to its provisions would be wholly temporary, and that
"we" who sponsored the bill "are not in any way interfering with the firmly established national immigration
policy." 4

Act, is set out below.' It will be noted that this section

this Act, would not be admitted under the former law.
The only exceptions from the long list of non-admissibles
under the 1917 and other Acts are these: illiterates and
those who have been induced to come into the country by
ing to perform agricultural labor in the United States, during continuation of hostilities in the present war, any such resident desiring to enter
the United States for that purpose shall be exempt from the payment
of head tax required by section 2 of the Immigration Act of February
5, 1917, and from other admission charges, and shall be exempt from
those excluding provisions of section 3 of such Act which relate to
contract laborers, the requirements of literacy, and the payment of
passage by corporations, foreign government, or others; and any such
resident shall be admitted to perform agricultural labor in the United
States for such time and under such conditions (but not including the
exaction of bond to insure ultimate departure from the United States)
as may be required by regulations prescribed by the Commissioner
of Immigration and Naturalization with the approval of the Attorney
General; and in the event such regulations require documentary evidence of the country of birth of any such resident which he is unable
to furnish, such requirement may be waived by the admitting officer
of the United States at the point where such resident seeks entry into
the United States if such official has other proof satisfactory to him
that such resident is a native of the country claimed as his birthplace.
Each such resident shall be provided with an identification card (with
his photograph and fingerprints) to be prescribed waider such regulations which shall be in lieu of all other documentary requirements,
including the registration at time of entry or after entry required by
the Alien Registration Act of 1940. Any such resident admitted under
-the foregoing provisions who fails to maintain the status for which he
was admitted or to depart from the United States in accordance with
the terms of his admission shall be taken into custody under a warrant
issued by the Attorney General 'at any time after entry and deported
in accordance with section 20 of the Immigration Act of February 5,
1917. Sections 5 and 6 of such Act shall not apply to the importation
of aliens under this title. No provision of this title shall authorize
the admission into the United States of any enemy alien." § 5 (g)

promises of employment, or whose passage has been paid
by corporat'ons or other persons. By specifically lifting
the immigration barriers in these respects, Congress left
the barriers in effect which barred physical and mental defectives, those with certain diseases, etc. And even the
exceptions granted were not unconditional, for under the
1944 Act agricultural laborers could still be admitted only
"for such time and under such conditions . . . as may be
required by regulations prescribed by the Commissioner
of Immigration and Naturalization with the approval of
the Attorney General . .. .
In pursuance of their authority under this Act, the immigration authorities have promulgated regulations which
provide in detail for the admission of agricultural laborers
who are "in all respects admissible under the provisions of
the immigration laws except" as to the particular limited
provisions of the 1917 Act designated in the 1944 Act. 8
C. F. R. Cum. Supp. § 115.2 (c). And as shown by the
Senate and House reports and hearings on the 1944 Act, a
vast program was to be carried out to permit agricultural
,laborers to enter and to remain in the United States, but
only for a limited time and under such conditions as conform with the immigration laws and regulations, and in
accordance, so far as this case is concerned, with agreements made with the Government of Mexico.' Far from
abolishing the responsibilities of the immigration authorities in examining and approving these persons at the border and supervising their stay, the 1944 Act, the treaty and
the regulations, although changing those responsibilities
in some respects, have actually increased them. Aliens
must still make a lawful entry at the places designated for
their examination, -screening, and registration. Those

who do not meet the statutory standards of the 1917 Act,
with the minor exceptions made in the 1944 Act, must be
turned back. And those who are permitted to enter remain subject to supervision, control, and early deportation
by immigration authorities."
This brings us to the contention that.Hoy cannot be
prosecuted under § 5 of the 1917 Act because the 1944 Act
provides that § 5 "shall not apply to the importation of
aliens under this title." But Hoy was not charged with
inducing or encouraging the Mexican aliens whom he
wrote to come in "under this title." ' He was allegedly inviting them to enter the country in disregard and defiance
of "this title" and all other law. Thus he was specifically
charged with inducing aliens to come into this country who
were not entitled to enter under the 1917 Act or "under
any other law of the United States, as . . . [he] then and

there well knew." If this charge, as clarified by the bill of
particulars, is true, he was urging aliens to come into this
country without passing through the immigration stations, without regard to the length of their stay, or whether
they were barred by reason of disease, physical weakness,
or any of the other disqualifications set out in the 1917 and
other laws or regulations.
The 1944 Act was intended to permit alien agricultural
workers to enter the country for a limited time under Government rules and regulations after proper proofs to
Government officials that the aliens were so qualified. It
7For example, under the treaty with Mexico governing wartime
immigration of these farm laborers our Government has the right to
determine where in the United States workers are needed most and to
send them there. Other provisions of the treaty require that 10% of
each worker's wages be earmarked and returned for deposit in Mexico,
and that their living and working conditions meet specified standards.
These provisions require close supervision of the admitted aliens by
immigration authorities. 56 Stat. 1759-1768; 57 Stat. 1152-1163.

Appropriation Act, 1944," § 5 (1), 58 Stat. 11, 17.

is true that the law was intended to fill the need for agricultural workers by removing the 1917 prohibition against
would-be employers' inviting and inducing foreign workers
to come to the United States. But we are not persuaded
that the law, which provided specific limitations and
requisites to entry under it, can properly be interpreted
to authorize would-be employers to invite, induce and
offer rewards to aliens to circumvent immigration processing and to enter the United States in disregard and defiance
of law. The 1917 prohibition against employers inducing
laborers to enter the country, enforceable by sanctions, removed obstacles which might hinder immigration authorities in the performance of their duties; we do not think
the 1944 Act was intended to license employers to obstruct
their performance.
