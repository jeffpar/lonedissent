Per Curiam.

MEEKS v. GEORGIA SOUTHERN &
FLORIDA RAILWAY CO.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF
APPEALS OF GEORGIA.

No. 981.

Decided June 1, 1964.*

Certiorari granted and judgments reversed.
Reported below: No. 981, 108 Ga. App. 808, 134 S. E. 2d 555.

Thomas J. Lewis and Thomas J. Lewis, Jr. for petitioner in No. 981.
W. Graham Claytor, Jr., Charles J. Bloch, Denmark
Groover, Jr. and William H. Allen for respondent in
No. 981.
George R. Wolf for petitioner in No. 1004.
Robert Broderick for respondent in No. 1004.
PER CURIAM.

The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted and
the judgments are reversed. Rogers v. Missouri Pacific
R. Co., 352 U. S. 500.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART
joins, dissenting in No. 981, and dissenting in part and
concurring in part in No. 1004.

These are two more negligence cases, neither of which
should have been brought here since both involve only
questions of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the
jury verdicts. See, e. g., my dissenting opinion in Dennis
v. Denver & Rio Grande W. R. Co., 375 U. S. 208, 212, and
*Together with No. 1004, Braswell, Administratrix, v. New York,
Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Co., on petition for writ of certiorari
to the Supreme Court of Illinois.

OCTOBER TERM, 1963.
Per Curiam.

those in the cases therein cited; cf. my dissenting opinion
in Eichel v. New York Central R. Co., 375 U. S. 253, 256.
Feeling obliged, however, to reach the merits because
the cases are before us, see my opinion in Rogers v. Missouri P. R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 559-562, I dissent from
the judgment in No. 981 and concur in the judgment in
No. 1004.
