PER CURIAM.

The respondent was a waitress in the grill car of one of
petitioner's trains. She brought this action under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C. ยง 51 et seq.,
for damages for injuries allegedly sustained when an
emergency application of the brakes brought the train to
a sudden stop. A jury which heard the case in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts returned a
verdict for respondent. The trial judge denied the petitioner's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict
and for a new trial. The Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit affirmed, 272 F. 2d 153. We granted certiorari,
362 U. S. 967.
The train was pulling into petitioner's station at Providence, Rhode Island, for a scheduled stop. One Montell,

apparently to commit suicide, stepped on the track from
the station platform as the train approached alongside the
platform. The engineer made'the emergency application
of the brakes in an unsuccessful effort to stop the train
before it reached Montell. We have examined the trial
record and hold that the proofs were insufficient to submit
to the jury the question whether employer negligence
played a part in the emergency application of the brakes
which allegedly produced the respondent's injury. See
Herdman v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 352 U. S. 518.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and
the cause remanded to the District Court with direction to
enter judgment for the petitioner notwithstanding the
verdict.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissent.
They believe there was evidence of negligence sufficient
for the jury, as summarized by Judge Woodbury, speaking for a unanimous Court of Appeals. " 272 F. 2d 153.
They also dissent from the direction to enter judgment
for the petitioner, since they are of the view that if there
is a reversal, there should be a new trial. See Galloway v.
United States, 319 U. S. 372, 396 (dissenting opinion).

For the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v.
Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, MR. JUSTICE
FRANKFURTER is of the view that the writ of certiorari was
improvidently granted.
