OCTOBER TERM, 1957.
Per Curiam.

357 U. S.

ROGERS v. RICHMOND, WARDEN.
ON

PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 755, Misc.

Decided June 16, 1958.

Certiorari denied with statement as to effect of opinion of Court of
Appeals in 252 F. 2d 807.

Louis H. Pollak for petitioner.
Abraham S. Ullman for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. We read
the opinion of the Court of Appeals as holding that while
the District Judge may, inless he finds a vital flaw in the
State Court proceedings, accept the determination in
such proceedings, he need not deem such determination
binding, and may take testimony. See Brown v. Allen,
344 U. S. 443, 506, et seq.
