CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE

No. 492.

TENTH

CIRCUIT.

Argued May 20, 1958.-Decided June 16, 1958.

A taxpayer must pay the full amount of an income tax deficiency
assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue before he may
challenge its correctness by a suit in a federal district court for
refund under 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a) (1). Pp. 63-76.
246 F. 2d 929, affirmed.

Randolph W. Thrower argued the cause for petitioner.
With him on the brief was A. G. McClintock. W. A.
Sutherland and Mac Asbill, Jr. entered an appearance for
petitioner.
John N. Stull argued the cause for the United States.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The issue in this case is whether a taxpayer must pay
the full amount of an income tax deficiency before he may
challenge its correctness by a suit for refund under
28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a)(1).
During 1950 petitioner suffered losses on the sale of
certain commodities and futures. He reported them as
ordinary losses, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue characterized them as capital losses. A deficiency
assessment was levied in the amount of $28,908.60, including interest. Petitioner made two payments that
totaled $5,058.54, and then submitted a claim for refund
of that amount. The claim was disallowed. On Aug. 3,
1956, petitioner brought this action under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a) (1) for refund. The United States moved to

dismiss for want of jurisdiction and for failure to state
a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district
judge held that because petitioner had not paid the full
amount of the deficiency he "should not maintain" the
action. Because the question had not been resolved by
the Court of Appeals, however, he deemed it advisable to
pass upon the merits, and upon doing so entered judgment for defendant United States. 142 F. Supp. 602.
The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated the
judgment and remanded with instructions to dismiss,
holding that the complaint "failed to state a claim"
because petitioner had not paid the entire assessment for
the period in question. 246 F. 2d 929.' We granted certiorari, 355 U. S. 881, to resolve the conflict between that
decision and Bushmiaer v- United States, 230 F. 2d 146
(C. A. 8th Cir.). 2
The pertinent jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a)(1), reads as follows:
"(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of:
"(1) Any civil action against the United States for
the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to
have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected

Opinion of the Court.

In matters of statutory construction the duty of this
Court is to give effect to the intent of Congress, and in
doing so our first reference is of course to the literal meaning of words employed. The principle of strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity, United States v.
Michel, 282 U. S. 656, and the sharp division of opinion
among the lower courts on the meaning of the pertinent
statutory language suggest the presence of ambiguity in
what might otherwise be termed a clear authorization
to sue for the refund of "any sum." Consequently, a
thorough consideration of the relevant legislative history
is required.
Section 1346 was originally enacted as Section 1310 (c)
of the Revenue Act of 1921.1 Its essential language
seems to have been copied from R. S. § 3226, the predece.ssor of the present claim-for-refund statute, 26 U. S. C.
(Supp. V) § 7422 (a). Those statutes use language identical to that appearing above to provide that no suit for
the refund of a "tax," "penalty," or "sum" shall be maintained until similar relief has been sought from the Secretary or his delegate.' The meaning that has been ascribed
to this language in the claim-for-refund statute provides
the key to what Congress intended when it used that
language in the jurisdictional provision.

or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed
with the Secretary or his delegate, according to the provisions of law
in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary or his delegate
established in pursuance thereof." R. S. § 3226 is quoted in note 7,

Opinion of the Court.

357 U. S.

The original claim-for-refund statute, Section 19 of the
Revenue Act of July 13, 1866, provided that no suit
should be maintained in any court for the recovery of
"any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected, until appeal shall have been duly.
made to the commissioner of internal revenue .... "I
On this "appeal" the Commissioner was empowered to
"remit, refund, and pay back" all taxes or penalties
improperly assessed or collected.' When the appeal requirement was restated in Section 3226 of the Revised
Statutes," Congress added the "penalty" and "sum"
clauses, bringing together for the first time the three-way
division that survives in 26 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 7422 (a)
and 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a)(1). The revisers left no indication of what significance, if any, was to be attached to
this addition.
During the period of this formative legislation refund
suits could not be brought against the United States
because of its sovereign immunity. Tax litigation took
the form of an action of assumpsit against the collector.

Opinion of the Court.

See Philadelphia v. Collector, 5 Wall. 720.8 Such suits
were of course subject to the provision in Section 19 of the
1866 Act that they must be preceded by "appeal" to the
Commissioner. The meaning of that command, which
later became R. S. § 3226 and eventually, as amended,
26 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 7422 (a), was considered in
Cheatham v. United States, 92 U. S. 85. There, in
response to an appeal, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had set aside the first assessment of taxpayer's 1864
income taxes and directed the local assessor to make a
second one. The taxpayer paid the second assessment
and sued the collector for refund. The Court held that
by failing to appeal from the second assessment the taxpayer failed to comply with Section .19 and hence had no
right of action. In the course of its opinion the Court
made this careful statement of the remedies then available to taxpayers who sought to contest the correctness
of their tax:
"So also, in the internal-revenue department, the
statute which we have copied allows appeals from
the assessor to the commissioner of internal revenue;
and, if dissatisfied with his decision, on paying the
tax the party can sue the collector; and, if the
money was wrongfully exacted, the courts will give
him relief by a judgment, which the United States
pledges herself to pay.
8 Initially such suits depended upon diversity jurisdiction. Collector

v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1. Later Congress created jurisdiction for "all
causes arising under any law providing internal revenue ......
R. S. § 629 Fourth. With slight modification that provision became
Section 24 Fifth of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1092, and is presently
28 U. S. C. § 1340. See Lowe Bros. Co. v. United States, 304 U. S.

302, 305.

OCTOBER TERM, 1957.
357 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"... While a free course of remonstrance and
appeal is allowed within the departments before the,
money is finally exacted, the general government
has wisely made the payment of the tax claimed,

whether of customs or of internal revenue, a condition precedent to a resort to the courts by the party
against whom the tax is assessed. .

.

. If the com-

pliance with this condition [that suit must be brought
within six months of the Commissioner's decision]
requires the party aggrieved to pay the money, he
must do it. He cannot, after the decision is rendered
against him, protract the time within which he can
contest that decision in the courts by his own delay
in paying the money. It is essential to the honor
and orderly conduct of the government that its taxes
should be promptly paid, and drawbacks speedily
adjusted;. and the rule prescribed in this class of
cases is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable ...
"The objecting party can take his appeal. He can,
if the decision is delayed beyond twelve months, rest
his case on that decision; or he can pay the amount
claimed, and commence his suit at any time within
that period. So, after the decision, he can pay at once,
and commence suit within the six months

....

,

(Emphasis added.)
From this carefully considered dictum it is unmistakably clear that the Court understood the statutes of that
time to require full payment of an assessed tax as a condition precedent to the right to sue the collector for a
refund. This understanding of the statutory scheme appears to have prevailed for the succeeding fifty or sixty
years. It was never suggested that the addition in R. S.
§ 3226 of the clause beginning."any sum" effected any
change. The Cheatham case was decided after that
S92 U. S., at 88-89.

Opinion of the Court.

addition was made, and it gave no indication that the
"condition precedent" of which it spoke had already been
abrogated by Congress. Consistent with that understanding, there does not appear to be a single case before
1940 in which a taxpayer attempted a suit for refund of
income taxes without paying the full amount the Government alleged to be due. Court opinions that took occasion to comment on the extent of payment are consistent
with the Cheatham declaration," ° and that case has
continued to be cited with approval to the present day."
Such was the understanding of the necessity for full payment in the suit against the collector.
Since the statute now under consideration, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a) (1), employs language identical to that in the
statute under which the full-payment understanding
developed, R. S. § 3226, a construction 'requiring full
payment would appear to be more consistent with the
established meaning of the statutory language. Furthermore, the situation with respect to tax suits against the
United States at the time 28 U. S. C. § 1346 (a) (1) was
enacted, the express purpose of its enactment, and subse"°Kings County Savings Institution v. Blair, 116 U. S. 200, 205

quent expressions of congressional intent all suggest that
the principle of full payment was to be preserved.
The jurisdictional provision that is now 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a)(1) was first enacted in Section 1310 (c) of
the Revenue Act of 1921.12 At that time the United
States was already suable in the District Courts. Since
1887 the Tucker Act had allowed suit against the United
States for claims less than $10,000 "founded upon . . .
any law of Congress . . . ," " and that language included suits to obtain refund of income taxes. United
States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Co., 237 U. S. 28.
Since R. S. § 3226 was cast in the broadest of terms, its
requirement that refund suits be preceded by an "appeal"
to the Commissioner clearly, applied to the Tucker Act
cases, United States v. Michel, 282 U. S. 656, and the
related requirement that full payment must be made
prior to suit seems to have been assumed to be equally
applicable. For amounts in excess of the $10,000 Tucker
Act limitation the taxpayer could invoke his old remedy
against the collector.
The complementary nature of the two District Court
remedies was impaired When this Court re-emphasized the
rule requiring the collector to be sued personally. A suit
against the office or the successor in office of a deceased
collector could not be maintained. Smietanka v. Indiana
Steel Co., 257 U. S. 1 (1921). Senator Jones if New Mexico interrupted floor debate on the Revenue Act of 1921 to
call attention to this decision. In his view it meant that
when the particular collector was dead a taxpayer suing
for more than $10,000 had to bring suit in the Court of
Claims. In addition to the extra expense and inconvenience of litigating in Washington, a Court of Claims

amendment, stating:

The Senator proposed an

"What is here proposed is that we shall remedy
that situation by providing that where the collector
to whom the revenue was paid has died then the
claimant may sue the United States. It simply
brings about an equitable situation and prevents the
taxpayer from having to suffer the hardships which
would be brought upon him simply through the accident of the death of the collector to whom he paid
the money. I offer the amendment for the purpose
of remedying that situation." 11
The amendment, which was accepted without further
comment, conferred jurisdiction on the District Court,
"Concurrent with the Court of Claims, of any suit
or proceeding, commenced after the passage of the
revenue act of 1921, for the recovery of any internalrevenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or
illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty
claimed to have been collected without authority or
any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any
manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws, even if the claim exceeds $10,000, if the
collector of internal revenue by whom such tax, penalty, or such was collected is dead at the time such
suit or proceeding is commenced." 11

to restate the jurisdiction of the District Court in refund
suits brought against the United States. As we have
seen, the District Courts already had such jurisdiction
under the Tucker Act, and there is no indication that
Congress intended any change in the terms on which
that action was made available other than the change that
was clearly set forth. The statute that is now 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a) (1) was enacted merely to remove the jurisdictional amount limitation of the Tucker Act in the
special situation where the collector could not be sued.
See Lowe Bros. Co. v. United States, 304 U. S. 302, 305.
The House Conference Report and a contemporary
Treasury Department declaration confirm this view of
the statute's effect. 16
The similarity of essential language leaves no doubt
that the terms of the jurisdictional provision were copied
from the claim-for-refund statute, R. S. § 3226, as
amended by Section 1318 of the Revenue Act of 1921."
The fact that this language had for many years been considered to require full payment before suing the collector,
and the fact that the avowed purpose of the 1921 amend-.
ment was merely to cure an inadequacy in the suit against
the collector, combine as persuasive indications that no
change was intended' in the full-payment principle
declared in Cheatham v. United States, supra.
When Congress created the Board of Tax Appeals in
1924,"8 it demonstrated a clear understanding that refund
suits could only be maintained upon full payment of the

tax alleged to be due. The House Committee proposing
the bill explained its purpose as follows:
"The committee recommends the establishment of
a Board of Tax Appeals to which a taxpayer may
appeal prior to the payment of an additional assessment of income, excess-profits, war-profits, or estate
taxes. Although a taxpayer may, after payment of
his tax, bring suit for the recovery thereof and thus
secure a judicial determination of the questions involved, he can not, in view of section 3224 of the
Revised Statutes, which prohibits suits to enjoin the
collection of taxes, secure such a determination prior
to the payment of the tax. The right of appeal after
payment of the tax is an incomplete remedy, and
does little to remove'the hardship occasioned by an
incorrect assessment. The payment of a large additional tax on income received several years previous
and which may have, since its receipt, been either
wiped out by subsequent losses, invested in nonliquid assets, or spent, sometimes forces taxpayers
into bankruptcy, and often causes great financial
hardship and sacrifice. These results are not remedied by permitting the taxpayer to sue for the recovery of the tax after this payment. He is entitled to
an appeal and to a determination of his liability for
the tax prior to its payment." "9
Petitioner argues that the "hardship" the Board of Tax
Appeals was created to alleviate was not the taxpayer's
inability to sue without paying the whole tax-for petitioner erroneously concludes that the 1921 amendment
conferred that right-but 'the Government's power to

collect the balance due while a refund suit was in progress.
But the Committee Report quoted above clearly demonstrates that the hardship about which the Congress was
concerned was the hardship of pre-litigation payment,
not post-litigation collection. Old Colony Trust Co. v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 279 U. S. 716, 721. '
The final step in the evolvement of 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a) (1) took place in the Act of July 30, 1954,"
which removed the $10,000 jurisdictional limitation and
eliminated the condition about the collector being dead
or out of office. Far from indicating an intent to allow
suit without full payment of the tax due, the legislative
history of that amendment shows a clear understanding
of the Cheatham requirement, and demonstrates a narrow
purpose in no way inconsistent with that requirement.
The House Report states:
"The purpose of this bill is to permit taxpayers a
greater opportunity to sue the United States in the
district court of their own residence to recover taxes
which they feel have been wrongfully collected. This
is done by removing the jurisdictional limitation of
$10,000 now imposed on such suits." 22
In explaining the present state of the law the Report goes
on to point out that a taxpayer may contest a deficiency
assessment by a petition in the Tax Court. "The tax20

"The Board of Tax Appeals . . . was created by Congress to

provide taxpayers an opportunity to secure an independent review
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's determination of additional
income and estate taxes by the Board in advance of their paying the
tax found by the Commissioner to be due. Before the Act of 1924
the taxpayer could only contest the Commissioner's determination
of the amount of the tax after its payment."

payer may, however," the Report continues, "elect to pay
his tax and thereafter bring suit to recover the amount
claimed to have been illegally exacted." 23
The foregoing study of the legislative history of 28
U. S. C. § 1346 (a) (1) and related statutes leaves no room
for contention that their broad terms were intended to
alter in any way the Cheatham principle of "pay first and
litigate later." 24 For many years that principle has been
reinforced by the rule that no suit can be maintained for
the purpose of restraining the assessment or *collection of
any tax.2" More recently, Congress took care to except
from the operation of the Federal Declaratory Judgments
Act any controversies "with respect to Federal taxes." 26
To ameliorate the hardship produced by these requirements Congress created a special court where tax questions could be adjudicated in advance of any payment.
But there is no indication of any intent to create the
hybrid remedy for which petitioner contends.
It is suggested that a part-payment remedy is necessary for the benefit of a taxpayer too poor to pay the full
amount of the tax. Such an individual is free to litigate
in the Tax Court without any advance payment. Where
the time to petition that court has expired, or where for
some other reason a suit in the District Court seems more
desirable, the requirement of full payment may in some
instances work a hardship. But since any hardship would
grow out of an opinion whose effect Congress in succes23Id.,
