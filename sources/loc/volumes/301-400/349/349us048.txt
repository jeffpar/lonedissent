SHAUGHNESSY, DISTRICT DIRECTOR OF
IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION, v. PEDREIRO.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 374.

Argued March 31, 1955.-Decided April 25 1955.

1. Under § 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, an alien whose
deportation has been ordered administratively under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 may obtain a judicial review of
such order by an action in a federal district court for a declaratory
judgment and injunctive relief. Pp. 49-52.
(a) Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, distinguished. P. 50.
(b) The 'provision of § 242 (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which makes deportation orders of the Attorney
General "final" does not "expressly" supersede or modify the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, within the meaning
of § 12 thereof, and does not make § 10-of the latter Act inapplicable to aeportation proceedings. Pp. 50-52.
(c) A habeas corpus proceeding is not the sole means of obtaining judicial review of a deportation order issued under the 1952
Act. An action in a federal district court to declare the order void
and enjoin its execution is an appropriate remedy. P. 52.
2. In an action in a federal district court against a District Director
of Immigration and Naturalization to review a deportation order,
declare it void and enjoin its execution, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization is not an indispensable party. Pp. 5254.
213 F. 2d 768, affirmed.

Oscar H. Davis argued the cause for petitioner. On
the brief were Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General Olney, John F. Davis, Beatrice Rosenberg
and Edward S. Szukelewicz.
Aaron L. Danzig argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
After administrative hearings, the respondent Pedreiro,
an alien, was ordered deported under the Immigration
and Nationality Act of 1952.' He petitioned the District Court for the Southern District of New York to
review the deportation order, declare it void and issue a
temporary injunction restraining its execution pending
final district court action. In part he contended that
there was no legal evidence to support the order and that
in. violation of due process he had been compelled to incriminate himself in the -hearings. Relief was sought
only against the District Director of Immigration and
Naturalization for the District of New York. The District Court dismissed the petition on the ground that
either the Attorney General or the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization was an indispensable party
and should have been joined. This holding made it unnecessary for the District Court to pass on another ground
urged for dismissal, that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 precluded judicial review of deportation
orders by any method except habeas corpus. The Court
of Appeals reversed, rejecting both contentions of the
Government. 213 F. 2d 768. In doing so it followed the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
which had held that deportation orders entered under the
1952 Immigration Act can be judicially reviewed in actions
for declaratory relief under § 10 of the Administrative
Procedure Act.2 Rubinstein v. Brownell, 92 U. S. App.
D. C. 328, 206 F. 2d 449, affirmed by an equally divided
Court, 346 U. S. 929. But, the Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit has held that habeas corpus is the only way
such deportation orders can be attacked. Batista v.

Nicolls, 213 F. 2d 20. Because of this conflict among the
circuits and the contention that allowing judicial review
of deportation orders other than by habeas corpus conflicts with Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, we granted
certiorari, 348 U. S. 882.
The Heikkila case, unlike this one, dealt with a deportation order under the Immigration Act of 1917. That Act
provided that deportation orders of the Attorney General
should be "final" 3 and had 1n been interpreted as precluding any type of, judicial review except by habeas
corpus. Heikkila contended that this narrow right of
review of deportation orders under the 1917 Act had been
broadened by § 10 of the 1946 Administrative Procedure
Act which authorizes review of agency action by any
appropriate method "except so far as (1) statutes preclude
judicial review . . . ." Because this Court had construed the word "final" in the 1917 Act as precluding
any review except by habeas corpus, it held that the
Administrative Procedure Act gave no additional remedy
since § 10 excepted statutes that precluded judicial review.
The Court carefully pointed out, however, that it did
not consider whether the same result should be reached
under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act "which
took effect after Heikkila's complaint was filed." '
Consequently Heikkila does not control this casre and we must
consider the effect of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act on the right to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.
Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that "Any person suffering legal wrong because of
any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by
such action within the meaning of any relevant statute,
shall be entitled to judicial review thereof." And § 12
8 39 Stat. 889, as amended, 54 Stat. 1238.

Opinion of the Court.

of the Act provides that "No subsequent legislation shall
be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act
except to the extent that such legislation shall do so
expressly." In the subsequent 1952 Immigration and
Nationality Act there is no language which "expressly"
supersedes or modifies the expanded right of review
granted by § 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
But the 1952 Immigration Act does provide, as did the
1917 Act, that deportation orders of the Attorney General shall be "final." The Government contends that
we should read this as expressing a congressional purpose
to give the word "final" in the 1952 Act -precisely the same
meaning Heikkila gave "final" in the 1917 Act and thereby
continue to deprive deportees of all .right of judicial review except by habeas corpus. We cannot accept this
contention.
Such a restrictive construction of the finality provision
of the present Immigration Act would run counter to § 10
and § 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Their purpose was to remove obstacles to judicial review of agency
action under subsequently enacted statutes like the 1952
Immigration Act. And as the Court said in the Heikkila
case, the Procedure Act is to be given a "hospitable"
interpretation. In that case the Court also referred to
ambiguity in the provision making deportation orders of
the Attorney General "final." It is more in harmony with
the generous review provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act to construe the ambiguous word "final"
in the 1952 Immigration Act as referring to finality in
administrative procedure rather than as cutting off the
right of judicial review in whole or in part. And it would
certainly not be in keeping with either of these Acts to
require a person ordered deported to go to jail in order
to obtain revievw by a court.
The legislative history of both the Administrative Procedure Act and the 1952 Immigration Act supports re340907 0

spondent's right to full judicial review of this deportation
order. The sponsors of the Administrative Procedure
Act were Representative Walter in the House and Senator
McCarran in the Senate. They were also the sponsors
of the 1952 Immigration Act. While the latter Act was
under consideration in the House, an amendment was
proposed which provided for liberal judicial review of
deportation orders. .Representative Walter assured the
House that the proposed amendment Was not needed. He
.said: "Now; we come to this question of the-finality
of the
decision of the Attorney General. That language means
that it is a final decision as far as the administrative
branch of the Government-is concerned, but it is not final
in that it is not the last remedy that the alien has. Section
10 of the Administrative Procedures Act is applicable." 6
With reference to the same problem Senator McCarran
assured the Senate that "the Administrative Procedure
Act is made applicable to the bill."6 It is argued that
these assurances by the chairmen of the committees in
charge of the bills were but isolated statements and that
other legislative history is sufficient to refute them. We
cannot agree. Our holding is that there is a right of judicial review of deportation orders other than by habeas
corpus and that the remedy sought here is an appropriate
one.
We also reject the Government's contention that the
Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization is an
indispensable party to an action for declaratory relief
of this kind.' District Directors are authorized by regulation to issue warrants of deportation, to designate the
country to which an alien shall be deported, and to determine when his mental or physical condition requires the

employment of a person to accompany him. The regulations purport to make these decisions of the District
Director final.' It seems highly appropriate, therefore,
that the District Director charged with enforcement of
a deportation order should represent the Government's
interest. Otherwise in order to try his case an alien
might be compelled to go to the District of Columbia to
obtain jurisdiction over the Commissioner. To impose
this burden on an alien about to be deported would be
completely inconsistent with the basic policy of the Administrative Procedure Act to facilitate court review of
such administrative action. We know of no necessity for
such a harsh rule. Undoubtedly the Government's defense can be adequately presented by the District Director
who is under the supervision of the Commissioner.
It is argued, however, that the Commissioner should
be an indispensable party because a judgment against a
District Director alone would not be final and binding
in other immigration districts. But we need not decide
the effect of such a judgment. We cannot assume that
a decision on the merits in a court of appeals on a question of this kind, subject to review by this Court, would
be lightly disregarded by the immigration authorities.
Nor is it to be assumed that a second effort to have the
same issue decided in a habeas corpus proceeding would
do any serious harm to the Government. In habeas
corpus proceedings district courts would have the duty
to consider previous court decisions on the same matter.
And even though in extraordinary circumstances new
matters not previously adjudicated may arise in habeas
corpus proceedings, this is no adequate reason for subjecting an alien to the great burden of having to go with his
witnesses to the District of Columbia, which may be far
distant from his home, in order to contest his deportation.

Our former cases have established a policy under which
indispensability of parties is determined on practical
considerations. See, e. g., Williams v. Fanning, 332 U. S.
490. That policy followed here causes us to conclude
that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization
is not an indispensable party.

and MR.

In Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U. S. 229, this Court held
that § 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, making
decisions of the Attorney General "final," was a statute
which precluded judicial review within the meaning of
the first exception to § 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Now, slightly more than two years later, the
Court holds that judicial-review- of deportation orders is
available under § 10 even though § 242 (b) of the 1952
Act is a re-enactment, 'almost verbatim, of the "final"
clause of the 1917 Act. The decision is based on three
considerations. First, § 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that, "No subsequent legislation shall
be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act
except to the extent that such legislation shall do so
expressly," and, in the opinion of the majority, there is
no language in the 1952 Act which "expressly" establishes a more limited review. Second, it is believed more
.consistent with the liberal review ,provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to confgrue "final" as referring
to finality in - the administrative -process. -And third,
isolated statements in the congressional debates indicate
that Congress actually'-in"tended to permit review under
Acti
the Administrative Procedure
Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act, however, as I read it, applies only where subsequently enacted
legislation, in the words of *Je Court, "superSedes or

modifies the expanded right of review granted by § 10 of
the Administrative Procedure Act," and this Court held
in the Heikkila case that the rights of aliens subject to
deportation were not enlarged by the Administrative
Procedure Act. Moreover, notwithstanding significant
substantive changes in the immigration laws in the 1952
Act, I hesitate to consider the re-enactment of a provision,
with minor changes in language, "subsequently enacted
legislation." The issue then is much like the one the
Court faced in Heikkila: whether, in the context of the
liberal review provisions of the Administrative Procedure
Act, Congress intended, by § 242 (b), to preclude application of § 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. As
this Court pointed out in Heikkila, the word "final,"
though ambiguous in other contexts, as used in immigration legislation since tle Immigration Act of 1891, has
precluded judicial review except by habeas corpus. In
view of this long history and the re-enactment of § 242
with only minor textual changes, I hesitate to impute to
Congress an intention to change the method of review
absent a clear showing. The Court found in examining
the legislative history that Representative Walter, one of
the sponsors of the 1952 Act as well as of the Administrativd Procedure Act, believed that § 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act applied to deportation orders. The
statement by Senator McCarran, however, that "the
Administrative Procedure Act is made applicable to the
bill," in context, may merely refer to the administrative
procedures aspect of an amendment proposed by Senator
Moody. 98 Cong. Rec. 5778, 5779. In any event,
the statements of Congressman Walter and Senator
McCarran, in the course of debate on the floor, are
less persuasive than the more carefully- prepared and
authoritative committee report, and the report of the
Senate Committee in charge of the bill would seem to
indicate that no change in the law was intended.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was lpreceded by extensive studies of the structure and operation
of the immigration law. These studies culminated in a
report by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary entitled,
The Immigration and Naturalization Systems of the
United States, S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. It
contains the following statement, at page 629:
"Judicial review
"Once the order and warrant of deportation are
issued, the administrative process is complete.
Under the fifth amendment to the Constitution, the
'due process' provision, the alien may, however, petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In a habeas corpus
proceeding, based on a deportation case, the court
determines whether or not there has been a fair hearing, whether or not the law has been interpreted
correctly, and whether or not there is substantial
evidence to support the order of deportation. Habeas
corpus is the proper remedy to determine the legality
of the detention of an alien in the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The dismissal of an application for a writ of habeas corpus
is not a bar to the filing of another application before
another judge."
Although this report was dated April 1950, it serves to
clarify any ambiguity in the statement in the Senate
report accompanying the bill in final form that judicial
review in immigration cases was not expanded "beyond
that under existing law." S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong.,
2d Sess. 28. The Committee, in using the phrase "existing
law," particularly in light of the long history of exclusive
habeas corpus review, was necessarily referring to the law
as understood and expressed in its prior report. Moreover, the report also states, at page 30, that "The bill

SHAUGHNESSY v. PEDREIRO.
48

MINTON,

57

J., dissenting.

declares that the prescribed deportation proceedings shall
be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the
deportability of any alien, notwithstanding the provisions
of any other law." The legislative history, therefore,
would seem to make it unmistakably clear that Congress,
aware that the word "final" as used in immigration legislation was not ambiguous, intended to preserve habeas
corpus as the only escape from a deportation order. It
was error to give relief under the Administrative
Procedure Act.
