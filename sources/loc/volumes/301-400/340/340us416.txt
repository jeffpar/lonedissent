MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The parties to this case are the same transit workers,
the same transit company, and the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board before the Court in No. 329,
decided this day, ante, p. 383. This action arises out of
the same threatened strike discussed in that case. After
a restraining order had led to postponement of the strike,
the Wisconsin Board appointed arbitrators to "hear and
determine" the dispute in accordance with the terms of
the Wisconsin Public Utility Anti-Strike Law. Wis. Stat.,
1949, § 111.55. Upon the filing of the arbitrators' award,
petitioners filed an action in a state circuit court to review
that award. Id., § 111.60. That court affirmed the
award and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, 257
Wis. 53, 42 N. W. 2d 477 (1950). We granted certiorari
in this case together with No. 329, 340 U. S.874 (195Q).
In the courts below and in this Court, petitionersattadk
the arbitration award on the same grounds urged against
the Wisconsin Act as a whole in No. 329, and, in addition,
raise issues peculiar to the arbitration phase of that act.
But we do not reach these issues since it is clear that this
case has become moot.*
*It has also been argued that No. 329 and No. 438 are moot by
reason of the settlement of the immediate dispute which led to

Opinion of the Court.

340 U. S.

The arbitration award became effective on April 11,
1949. Under the Wisconsin Act, that award "shall continue effective for one year from that date," unless sooner
terminated by agreement of the parties. Wis. Stat., 1949,
§ 111.59. We are informed that this award was superseded by agreement, and, in any event, the one-year period
has elapsed. There being no subject matter upon which
the judgment of this Court can operate, the cause is moot.
It is argued that the Wisconsin courts have adopted a
practice of deciding questions of importance even though
the case has become moot, and we are urged to follow that
same practice. But whatever the practice in Wisconsin
courts, "A federal court is without power to decide moot
questions or to give advisory opinions which cannot affect
the rights of the litigants in the case before it. United
States v. Alaska S. S. Co., 253 U. S. 113, 115-16, and
cases cited; United States v. Hamburg-American Co., 239
U. S. 466, 475-77." St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U. S.
41, 42 (1943).
It appearing that the cause has become moot, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is vacated without costs and the cause is remanded for such proceedings
as by that court may be deemed appropriate.
It is so ordered.

the strike action in each case. The injunction before us in No.
329 is "perpetual" by its terms so that the action does not become
moot even though the decree be obeyed. J. I. Case Co. v. Labor
Board, 321 U. S. 332, 334 (1944); Federal Trade Comm'n v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 304 U. S. 257, 260 (1938), and cases cited
therein. As to No. 438, the judgment below imposes fines upon petitioners. No question of mootness can be raised so long as enforcement of that judgment is sought.
