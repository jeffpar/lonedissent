CASES ADJUDGED
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA

ET AL.

ON MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS.

No. 10, Original. Argued October 12-15, 1959.Decided May 31, 1960.
Invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court under Art. III' ยง 2 of
'the Constitution, the United States brought suit against the States
of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, seeking a
declaration that it is entitled to exclusive possession of, and full
dominion and power over, the lands, minerals and other natural
resources underlying the waters of the Gulf of Mexico more than
three geographical miles seaward from the coast of each State and
extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf. It also asked that
the States be enjoined from interfering with the rights of the United
States in that area and that they be required to account for all
sums of money derived by them therefrom since June 5, 1950.
Held:
1. The Submerged Lands Act grants to each coastal State the
ownership of submerged lands within three geographical miles from
its coast; but no boundary in excess of three miles was fixed ipso
facto for any State. Pp. 13, 20-25.
2. The Act preserved the right of each Gulf State to prove
boundaries extending more than three geographical miles (but not
more than three marine leagues) into the Gulf; but each State
must establish the existence of such a boundary in judicial proceedings. Pp. 25-26.
3. To satisfy the requirements of the Act, a State's seaward
boundary beyond three geographical miles from its coast must be
one which, by virtue of congressional action, would have been

legally effective to carry, as between the State and the Nation,
submerged land rights under the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee v.
Hagan, 3 How. 212, as Congress conceived that rule to have been
prior to this Court's decision in United States v. California, 332
U. S. 19. The mere existence of such a boundary prior to the time
the State was admitted to the Union is not alone sufficient.
Pp. 24-36.
4. The fact that, in the field of foreign relations, the policy of the
Executive Branch of the Government may have been to refuse to
assert territorial jurisdiction more than three miles from shore
would not impair the effectiveness of a State's seaward boundary
fixed by Congress more than three miles from shore, so far as
the purely domestic purposes of the Submerged Lands Act are
concerned. Pp. 30-36.
5. Texas having claimed a maritime boundary at three marine
leagues from her coast when she was an independent republic prior
to admission to the Union, and this boundary having been confirmed pursuant to the Annexation Resolution of 1845, Texas is
entitled under the Submerged Lands Act to a gran't of three marine
leagues from her coast for domestic purposes. Pp. 36-65.
6. Louisiana is entitled to submerged-land rights to a distance
no greater than three geographical miles from its coastlines,
wherever those lines may ultimately be shown to be. Pp. 66-79.
7. Mississippi is not entitled to rights in submerged lands lying
beyond three geographical miles from its coast. Pp. 79-82.
8. Alabama is not entitled to rights in submerged lands lying
beyond three geographical miles from its coast. P. 82.
9. As to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, a
decree will be entered (1) declaring that the United States is
entitled, as against these States, to all the lands, minerals and other
natural resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico more than three
geographical miles from the.coast of each such State, that is, from
the line of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland
waters, and extending seaward to the edge of the Continental
Shelf; (2) declaring that none of these States is entitled to any
interest in such lands, minerals and resources; (3) enjoining these
States from interfering with the rights of the United States
therein; (4) directing each such State appropriately to account to
the United States for all sums of money derived therefrom subsequent to June 5, 1950; and (5) dismissing Alabama's cross bill.

that is, from the line of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit

to exclusive possession of, and full dominion and power
over, the lands, minerals, and other natural resources
underlying the waters of the Gulf of Mexico more than
three geographical miles seaward from the coast of each
State and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf.1
The complaint also asks that the States be enjoined from
interfering with the rights of the United States in that
area, and that they be required to account for all sums of
money derived by them therefrom since June 5, 1950.
The case is now before us on the motions of the United
States for judgment on the pleadings and for dismissal
of Alabama's cross bill seeking to establish its rights to
such submerged lands and resources within three marine
leagues of its coast.
The controversy is another phase of the more than 20
years' dispute between the coastal States and the Federal
Government over their respective rights to exploit the oil
and other natural resources of offshore submerged lands.
In 1947 this Court held that, as against California, the
United States possessed paramount rights in such lands
underlying the Pacific Ocean seaward of the low-water
mark on the coast of California and outside of inland
waters. United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19, 804.
And on June 5, 1950, the Court, following the principles
announced in the Californiacase, made like holdings with
respect to submerged lands in the Gulf of Mexico similarly
lying off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, and directed
both States to account to the United States for all sums
derived from natural resources in those areas after that
date. United States v. Louisiana, 339 U. S. 699, 340

U. S. 900.3
On May 22,. 1953, Congress, following earlier repeated unsuccessful attempts at legislation dealing with
state and federal rights in submerged lands,4 passed the
Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. ยงยง 13011315. By that Act the United States relinquished to the
coastal States all of its rights in such lands within certain geographical limits, and confirmed its own rights
s In 1945 the United States had proclaimed,. as against other
nations, itg jurisdiction and control over such submerged lands to the
edge of the Continental Shelf. Presidential Proclamation No. 2667,
Sept. 28, 1945, 10 Fed. Reg. 12303, 59 Stat. 884. The accompanying
Executive Order provided that "[n]either this Order nor the aforesaid
proclamation shall be deemed to affect the determination by legislation or judicial decree of any issues between the United States and
the several states, relating to the ownership or control of the subsoil
and sea bed of the continental shelf within or outside of the threemile limit." Exec. Order No. 9633, 10 Fed. Reg. 12305.
The "continental shelf," in the geological sense, is the gently sloping
plain which underlies the seas adjacent to most land masses, extending
seaward from shore to the point at which there is a marked increase
in the gradient of the decline and where the continental slope leading
to the true ocean bottom begins. In the Gulf of Mexico, the edge
of the Continental Shelf, as so defined, lies as much as 200 miles from
shore in some places. Christopher, The Outer Continental Shelf

The purposes of the Submerged Lands Act are described
in its title as follows:
"To confirm and establish the titles of the States to
lands beneath navigable waters within State boundaries and to the natural resources within such lands
and waters, to provide for the use and control of said
lands and resources, and to confirm the jurisdiction
and control of the United States over the natural
resources of the seabed of the Continental Shelf
seaward of State boundaries."
To effectuate these purposes the Act, in pertinent
part1. relinquishes to the States the entire interest of the
United States in all lands beneath navigable waters
within state boundaries (ยง 3, 43 U. S. C. ยง 1311);
2. defines that area in terms of state boundaries "as

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

The United States concedes that the statute grants to
each of the defendant States submerged land rights in
the Gulf of Mexico to the extent of three geographical
miles, but contends that none of them is entitled to anything more. The States, conceding that three leagues is
the limit of the statute's grant in the Gulf, contend that
each of them is entitled to that much. The wide-ranging
arguments of the parties, reflecting no doubt the magnitude of the economic interests at stake, 1 can be reduced
to the following basic contentions:
The Government starts with the premise that the
Act grants submerged land rights to a distance of more
than three miles only to the extent that a Gulf State
can show, in accordance with ยง 2 (b) of the Act, either
that it had a legally established seaward boundary in
excess of three miles at the time of its admission to the
Ufiion, or that such a boundary was thereafter approved
for it by Congress prior to the passage of the Submerged
Lands Act. It is contended that the Act did not purport
to determine, fix, or change the boundary of any State,
but left it to the courts to ascertain whether a particular
State had a seaward boundary meeting either of these
requirements. The Government then urges, as to any
State relying on its original seaward boundary, that the
Act contemplates as the measure of the grant a boundary
which existed subsequent to a State's admission to the
of the subsoil and seabed of the Continental Shelf lying seaward and
outside of the area of lands beneath navigable waters, as (efined in
section 2 hereof, all of which natural resources appertain to the
United States, 'and the jurisdiction and control of which by the United
States is hereby confirmed."
Later in the same year, Congress passed the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act, 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. ยงยง 1331-1343, which provides in detail for federal exploitation of the submerged lands of the
Continental Shelf beyond those granted to the States by the Submerged Lands Act.

Opinion of the Court.

Union, and not one which existed only prior to admission-in other words, a boundary carrying the legal consequences of the event of admission. It reasons from this
that since a State's seaward boundary cannot be greater
than the national maritime boundary, and since the national boundary was at all relevant times never greater
than three miles, no State could have had a seaward
boundary in excess of three miles, regardless of what it
may have claimed prior to admission. Further, the Government undertakes to show that, irrrespective of the
extent of the national maritime boundary, none of these
States ever had a valid seaward boundary in excess of three
miles, even prior to admission, and that no such boundary
was thereafter approved by Congress for any State.
The States, on the other hand, make several alternative
arguments. At one extreme, they contend that the Submerged Lands Act ipso facto makes a three-league grant
to all the Gulf States, or at least that the Act by its terms
establishes the seaward boundary of some States, notably
Texas and Florida, at three leagues. Alternatively, they
argue that if the extent of such state boundaries "at the
time" of admission was left to judicial determination,
then the controlling inquiry is what seaward boundary
each State had just prior to admission. If, however, the
Act contemplates a boundary as fixed by the event of
admission, each State contends that Congress fixed for it a
three-league Gulf boundary, and that whatever may have
been the extent of the national maritime boundary at the
time is an irrelevant factor. Florida further contends
that when it was readmitted to the Union in 1868, Congress approved for it a three-league Gulf boundary. And
finally the States argue that if the national boundary is in
any way relevant, it has at all material times in fact been
at three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.
Both sides have presented in support of their respective
positions a massive array of historical documents, of which

we take judicial notice, and substantially agree that all
the issues tendered can properly be disposed of on the
basis of the pleadings and such documents.
In this opinion we consider the issues arising in common
between the Government and all the defendant States,
and the particular claims of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Alabama, all of which depend upon their original
admission boundaries. The particular claims of Florida,
which involve primarily its readmission boundary, are
considered in a separate opinion. Post, p. 121.
I.
THE COMMON ISSUES.

A. The Statute On Its Face.
The States' contention that the Act ipso facto grants
them submerged land rights of three leagues in the Gulf
may be shortly answered. The terms of the statute
require rejection of such a construction. Rather the
measure of the grant in excess of three miles is made to
depend entirely upon the location of a State's original or
later Congressionally approved maritime boundary, subject only to the three-league limitation of the grant.
We turn next to the question whether, as the States
contend, the first of the two alternative requirements of
ยง 2-a boundary which "existed at the time such State
.became a member of the Union' -is satisfied merely by
showing a preadmission boundary, or whether, as the
Government claims, that requirement contemplates only
a boundary that carries the legal consequences of the
event of admission. While it is manifest that the second
requirement of ยง 2-a boundary wlhich was "heretofore
approved by Congress"-must take into account the effect
of Congressional action, it is not clear from the face of the
statute that the same is true of the first requirement-a

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.
Opinion of the Court.

363 U. S.

boundary "as it existed at the time [a] State became a
member of the Union."
The Government argues that in construing the first
requirement of ยง2 the effect of Congressional action cannot be ignored because to do so would be to measure the
boundary prior to the time a State became amember of the
Union, and "at the time" cannot mean "prior to the time."
However, it might be contended with equal force that to
take account of the effect of Congressional action would
be to measure the boundary after the time the State
became a member of the Union, and "at the time" cannot
mean "after the time." Indeed, if "at the time" were to
be taken in a perfectly literal sense, it could refer only to
the timeless instant before which the consequences of not
being a State would obtain, and after which the consequences of statehood would follow, leaving unanswered
the question whether the effect of Congressional action
was to be considered or not. In short, if the term is to be
given content it must'be read as referring either to some
time before or after the instant of admission, or to both
times.
As an aid to construction of "at the time" in ยง 2, the
Government points to ยง 4, the last sentence of which
states:
"Nothing in this section is to be construed as questioning or in any manner prejudicing the existence of any
State's seaward boundary beyond three geographical
miles if it was so provided by its constitution or laws
prior to or at the time such State became a member
of the Union, or if it has been heretofore approved by
Congress." (Emphasis supplied.)
It is urged that the disjunctive use of the terms "prior to"
and "at the time" shows that the latter must have been
used to refer to the time after admission, since the phraseology would otherwise be redundant, and that such meaning should also be attributed to the same term in ยง 2,

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
1

Opinion of the Court.

thereby including the effect of Congressional action. But,
as has already been indicated, "at the time" inherently
can also be taken as referring to the preadmission period,
thereby excluding the effect of such action. And on that
basis there would be no redundancy in the phrase "prior
to or at the time" if "at the time" meant immediately
before the instant of admission and "prior to" referred to
times substantially prior to admission; yet this would
nonetheless exclude the effect of Congressional action. So
far as the statute itself is concerned, the Government's
argument is thus inconclusive.
Nor do the States' arguments upon the face of the statute illumine the meaning of "at the time" as used in ยง 2.
They contend that the meaning of ยง 2 is explained or
clarified by the last sentence of ยง 4. According to them,
a boundary "existed at the time [a] State became a member of the Union" (ยง 2) if "it was so provided by its
constitution or laws prior to or .at the time such State
became a member of the Union .0..."
(ยง 4.) Under
this view, whatever the meaning of "at the time," the
existence of a state constitutional or statutory three-league
provision prior to admission would conclusively establish
the boundary contemplated by the Act, irrespective of
the character of Congressional action upon admission.
However, this provision appears not in the definitional
or granting sections of the statute (ยงยง 2 or 3), but in
ยง 4, the purpose of which is to approve and confirm the
boundaries of all States at three miles, and to negative any prejudice which might thereby result to claims
in excess of three miles. it thus does not define the
grant, but at most describes the claims protected from
prejudice by ยง 4 in terms of their most likely nature. A
fair reading of the section does not point to the conclusion
that claims of this nature were deemed to be self-proving.
Finally, there is no indication on the face of the statute

ascertaining the location of state seaward boundaries.for
purposes of the Act.
Because the statute on its face is inconclusive as to these
issues, we turn to the legislative history.
B. The Legislative History.
This Court early held that the 13 original States, by
virtue of the sovereignty acquired through revolution
against the Crown, owned the lands beneath navigable
inland waters within their territorial boundaries, and that
each subsequently admitted State acquired similar rights
as an inseparable attribute of the equal sovereignty guaranteed to it upon admission. Pollard'sLessee v. Hagan,
3 How. 212.12 It was assumed by many, and not without
reason,"3 that the same rule would be applied to lands
beneath navigable waters of the marginal sea, that is,
beyond low-water mark and the outer limit of inland
waters. However, beginning in the 1930's, the Federal
Government, while conceding the validity of the Pollard
rule as to inland waters, disputed its applicability to submerged lands beyond that limit, and claimed ownership
12This holding was approved in a considerable number of subsequent cases. See, e. g., Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, 74; Mumford
v. Wardwell, 6 Wall. 423, 436; Weber v. Harbor Commissioners, 1.8
Wall. 57, 65-66; McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S.391, 394; Shively

also Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410.
13This Court in the California case, supra, at 36, stated that
in following the Pollard case, it had previously "used language strong
enough to indicate that the Court then believed that states not only
owned tidelands and soil under navigable inland waters, but also
owned soils under all navigable waters within their territorial jurisdiction, whether inland or not."

of those lands for the United States.'
The controversy
centered primarily on the ownership of the oil-rich submerged lands off the coast of California. The State maintained that its original constitution, adopted in 1849
before it was admitted to the Union, established a seaward boundary three English miles from the coast,15 that
this boundary was ratified by the Act of Congress admitting it to the Union, and that therefore under the Pollard
rule, it was entitled to all submerged lands lying within
three English miles of its coast. This Court refused so
to apply Pollard, and held in the Californiacase and the
subsequent Louisiana and Texas cases, supra, that paramount rights in the marginal sea are an attribute of
national rather than state sovereignty, irrespective of the
location of state seaward boundaries.
Meanwhile an extended series of attempts was underway to secure Congressional legislation vesting in the
States the ownership of those lands which would be theirs
under an application of the Pollard rule to the marginal
sea.1" It was strongly urged, both before and after the

The legislative history of all the bills considered prior to enactment of the Submerged Lands Act in 1953 is

years relied on the applicability of the Pollardrule to the

5992, at 1, 2, 3, 16 (Apr. 21, 1948): "H. R. 5992 is, in substance, the
same as numerous bills introduced in the House. . . . [T]he aforementioned bills [were] introduced in the Congress to preserve the
status quo as it was thought to be prior to the California decision . . . to confirm and establish the rights and claims of the 48
States, long asserted and enjoyed with the approval of the Federal
Government, to the lands and resources beneath navigable waters
within their boundaries . . .
The repeated assertions by our
highest Court for a period of more than a century of the doctrine
of State ownership of all navigable waters, whether inland or not,
and the universal belief that such was the settled law, have for all
practical purposes established a principle which the committee believes
should as a matter of policy be recognized and confirmed by Congress
as a rule of property law."
S. Rep. No. 1592, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., to accompany S. 1988, at
17-18 (June 10, 1948), after noting that the legal profession had
long believed that the States owned the lands under navigable waters
within their territorial jurisdiction, went on to comment:
"The evidence is conclusive that not only did our most eminent
jurists so believe the law to be, but such was the belief of lower
Federal court jurists and State supreme court jurists as reflected by
more than 200 opinions. The pronouncements were accepted as the
settled law.by lawyers and authors of leading legal treatises.
"The present Court in the California decision did not expressly
overrule these prior Supreme Court opinions but, in effect, said that
all the efiinent authorities were in error in their belief.
"For the first time in history the Court drew a distinction between
-the legal principles applicable to bays, harbors, sounds, and other
inland waters on the one hand, and to submerged lands lying seaward
of the low-water mark on the other, although it appears the Court
had ample opportunity to do so in many previous cases, but failed
or refused to draw such distinction. In the California decision the

Opinion of the Court.

Thus virtually every "quitclaim" measure introduced
between 1945 and 1953, when the Submerged Lands Act
was ultimately enacted, framed the grant in terms of
"lands beneath navigable waters within State boundaries."
This framework was employed because the sponsors understood this Court to have established, prior to the California decision, a rule of state ownership itself defined in
Court refused to apply what it termed 'the old inland water rule'
to the submerged coastal lands; however, historically speaking, it
seems clear that the rule of State ownership of inland waters is, in
fact, an offshoot of the marginal sea rule established much earlier."
H. R. Rep. No. 695, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., to accompany H. R. 4484,
at 5 (July 12, 1951):
"Title II merely fixes as the law of the land that which, throughout
our history prior to the Supreme Court decision in the California
case in 1947, was generally believed and accepted to be the law of
the land; namely, that the respective States are the sovereign owners
of the land beneath navigable waters within their boundaries and of
the natural iesources within such lands and waters. Therefore,
title II recognizes, confirms, vests, and establishes in the States the
title to the submerged lands, which they have long claimed, over
which they have always exercised all the rights and attributes of
ownership."
S. Rep. No. 133, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., to accompany S. J. Res. 13,
at 7-8 (Mar. 27, 1953):
"All of these areas of submerged lands have been treated alike in
this legislation because they have been possessed, used, and claimed by
the States under the same rule of law, to wit: That the States own
all lands beneath navigable waters within their respective boundaries.
Prior to the California decision, no distinction had been made between
lands beneath inland waters and lands beneath seaward waters so
long as they were within State boundaries.
"The rule was stated by the Supreme Court in the early case of
Pollard v. Hagan . ...
"The purpose of this legislation is to write the law for the future
as the Supreme Court believed it to be in the lpast-that the States
shall own and have proprietary use of all lands under navigable

cases which had applied that rule involved lands below

Which does not depend upon state boundaries, this Court
has never had occasion to consider the precise nature and
method of determining state territorial boundaries in the
open sea, such as would cir'cumscribe the extent of state
ownership of offshore lands under an application of the
Pollard rule. Because Congress, in the exercise of its
constitutional power to dispose of federal property, has
chosen so to frame its grant, we are now called on to
resolve such questions 'in light of the Act's history and
purposes.
1. Confirmation of All Boundaries at Three Miles.
From the very outset, the sponsors of "quitclaim" legislation believed that all States were entitled to at least
three miles of coastal submerged lands."l The earliest
bills confirmed to the States all lands beneath navigable
waters within their boundaries, and defined "lands
beneath navigablo waters" to include at least all lands
lying within three geographical miles of the coast of
each State.2 However, they contained no definition of18 For example, the very first "quitclaim" bill introduced in Congress-H. J. Res. 118, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., provided:
"Resolved . . . That, in consideration of the premises, the United
States of America hereby releases, remises, and quitclaims all right,
title, interest, claim, or demand of the United States of America
in and to all lands beneath tidewaters and all lands beneath navigable
waters within the boundaries of each of the respective States . .. ."

"boundaries," and it was apparently assumed that the
boundaries of all States extended at least three miles.2'
Opponents of such legislation quickly pointed out that
while California based its three-mile claim on an expressly
defined maritime boundary, many, if not most, of the
coastal States lacked such a boundary,22 and that therefore, such States could not avail themselves of the Pollard
rule,. the applicability of which is restricted to areas within
the actual territorial boundaries of the State, even assuming the rule to be capable of application beyond low-water
mark.22 Proponents of the legislation alleged it to be

tidewaters" to denote the lands beneath the navigable waters of the
marginal sea.
21 See H. R. Rep. No. 927, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., to accompany
H. J. Res. 225, at 2 (July 17, 1945): "The ownership by the States
of these lands as above stated is coextefisive with the States' boundaries, which in the case of the. coastal States is in no instance less
than 3 miles from the coast line." 92 Cong. Rec. 9541 (remarks of
Senator Cordon): "[T]he joint resolution is limited to those submerged lands within the boundaries of the several States, with this
exception, that if there should be-and there conceivably cannot be a
State whose boundary did not go 3 miles at sea-then it would cover
3 miles at sea."

defective in that it granted only those lands beneath
navigable waters which lay within state boundaries, and
that this Court in the Californiacase, while not expressly
passing on the question, had cast doubt on whether any
of the original States ever had a boundary beyond its
coast.2 ' As a result, a new section was added, substantially similar to the second and third sentences of ยง 4 of
the present Act (see note 8, ante), which permitted each
State which had not already done so to extend its boundary seaward three miles and approved all such extensions
theretofore or thereafter made, without prejudice to any
State's claim that its boundary extended beyond three
miles."
It is not entirely clear on what theory Congress thus
conclpded that each State owned the submerged lands
within three miles of its coast, irrespective of the existence
of an expressly defined seaward. boundary to that distance.
It was substantially agreed that the 13 original Colonies
owned the lands within three miles of their coasts because
of their sovereignty and the alleged international custom
which permitted a nation to extend its territorial jurisdiction that far.2" Some proponents of the legislation
seem to have concluded that therefore, not only did the

Because of fears that this permission to extend boundaries would

similar rights within three miles, irrespective of the

ownership within three miles came about by operation of
federal law because of the Federal Government's assumed
adherence to the three-mile limit of territorial waters.1
While some speakers maintained that these factors in
effect gave each State a three-mile maritime boundary,"
others eschewed technical reliance on the matter of
boundaries and thought it sufficient that the Pollard rule
had always been thought to confer ownership on the State
of lands within three miles of the coast and that the
States ought to be restored to the position they believed
they had formerly occupied." And there is some sugges27

tion that since many States, under the Congressional view
of Pollard,had indisputable claims to three miles of submerged lands, the remainder ought to be treated on a
parity whether or not their claims were technically
justified.31 The upshot of all of these differing views was
the confirmation of each coastal State's seaward boundary
at three geographical miles.
2. Boundaries Beyond Three Miles.
Whatever may have been the uncertainty attending
the relevance of state boundaries with respect to rights
in submerged lands within three miles of the coast, we
find a clear understanding by Congress that the question
of rights beyond three miles turned on the existence of
an- expressly defined state boundary beyond three miles.
Congress was aware that several States claimed such a
boundary. Texas throughout repeatedly asserted its
claim that when an independent republic its statutes
established a three-league maritime boundary, and that
the United States ratified that boundary when Texas was
admitted to the Union and permitted Texas to retain its
own public lands." Florida repeatedly asserted its claim
that subsequent to its secession at the time of the Civil
War, it framed a constitution which established a threeleague boundary along its Gulf coast, "nd that such
boundary was ratified when Congress in 1868 approved
question or boundary question is immaterial to us. Our position is
that they should be restored to where they thought they were." 1948

the State's constitution and readmitted it to the Union."
Louisiana asserted that the Act of Congress admitting it
to the Union in 1812 fixed for it a three-league maritime
boundary by virtue of the provision which includes within
the State "all islands within three leagues of the coast." "
And it was suggested that Mississippi and Alabama might
claim boundaries six leagues in the Gulf because of similar
provisions in the Acts admitting them to the Union. 5
It was recognized that if the legal existence of such
boundaries could be established, they would clearly entitle
the respective States to submerged land rights to that
distance under an application of the Pollard rule to the
marginal sea. Hence, while a three-mile boundary was
expressly confirmed for all coastal States, the right of the
Gulf States to prove boundaries in excess of three miles
was preserved. This treatment of the matter was carried
into all the numerous "quitclaim" bills by language similar
to that found in ยง 4 of the present Act, confirming. all
coastal state boundaries at three miles and negating any
prejudice to boundary claims in excess of that.3" Repeated
expressions of the Act's sponsors make it absolutely clear
that no boundary in excess of three miles was fixed for
any State, but that a State would have to establish the
7
existence of such a boundary in judicial proceedings.

The many individual expressions of views as to the location of particular state boundaries-notably statements
that the effect of the Act would be to give Texas and
Florida three leagues of submerged land rights 38-while
undoubtedly representing the sincere" beliefs of the speakers, cannot serve to relieve this Court from making an
independent judicial inquiry and adjudication on the
subject, as contemplated by Congress.
The earlier "quitclaim" bills defined the grant in terms
of presently existing boundaries," since such boundaries
would have circumscribed the lands owned by the States
under an application of Pollard to the marginal sea.
However, the sponsors of these measures soon recognized
that present boundaries could be ascertained only by
reference to historic events. The claims advanced by the
Gulf States during consideration of earlier bills were identical to those subsequently asserted." The theory of those
claims, as we have noted, depended either, as in the cases
of Texas and Florida, upon a constitutional or statutory
provision allegedly ratified by Congressional acquiescence,
or, as in the cases of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama,
upon express Congressional action. Indeed, it could
hardly have been contended that Congressional action surrounding the event of admission was not relevant to the

were made, however, that States might by their own action
have effectively extended, or be able to extend, their
boundaries subsequent to admission." To exclude the
possibility that States might be able to establish present
boundaries based on extravagant unilateral extensions,
such as those recently made by Texas and Louisiana, 2
subsequent drafts of the bill introduced the twofold test
of the present Act-boundaries which existed at the time
of admission and boundaries heretofore approved by Congress. 3 It is apparent that the purpose of the change
was not to alter the basic theory of the grant, but to assure
that the determination of boundaries would be made in

accordance with that theory-that the States should be
"restored" to the ownership of submerged lands within
their present boundaries, determined, however, by the
historic action taken with respect to them jointly by Congress and the State." It was such action that the framers
of this legislation conceived to fix the States' boundaries
Representative Willis of Louisiana made clear the nature of the
inquiry it was contemplated the courts would make to ascertain the
location of "historic boundaries":
"Mr. WILLIS. Do you know of a better criteria than a historic
approach?
"Secretary McKAY. No, sir.
"Mr. WILLIS. Let us apply that criteria to Texas, for instance, and
I think you and I are in thorough agreement. Texas was a republic.
The Republic of Texas took certain action. Then there was a treaty
between the Republic of Texas and the United States preliminary to
admission. There might have been maps exhibited or maps in existence at that time. Then Congress passed an act admitting Texas into
the Union, and then Texas adopted a constitution delimiting its historic boundaries. Those are the historic documents that set forth
Texas' title; is that correct ?,
"Secretary McKAY. That is right. If my memory is correct, the
United States would not take the land. They gave it back to Texas.
"Mr. WILLIS. That is right. There is nothing unusual about that.
Let me illustrate the point in this way. I know you are not a lawyer,
but-I think you can follow this. If a farmer should consult a lawyer
to find out what the limits of his farm are, that lawyer would have
to examine the papers. He would have to go first to the patent.
He would hav to consult all the deeds in the chain of title. There
might be maps attached to those deeds which help to interpret them.
After his study he would give an opinion on the limits, based upon
the history of that title, and every link in the chain.

against subsequent change without their consent and
therefore to confer upon them the long-standing equities
which the measure was intended to recognize.4 5
Somewhat later, the last sentence of the present Act's
ยง 4 was added, for the specific purpose of assuring that
the boundary claims of Texas and Florida would be preserved.46 The first part of the sentence (see note 8, ante),
intended to refer to Texas alone, protects the State's claim
to a three-league boundary as "provided by its constitution or laws prior to or at the time such State became
a member of the Union." That claim, however, was
asserted to rest not only on its statute but also on the
the historic boundaries and second about the outer continental shelf
of the States. Let me explain what these terms mean.
"Each State was admitted into the Union by an act of Congress, and
each State adopted a constitution which was approved by the Congress. The act of Congress and the first Constitution defined the
boundaries of each State in the first instance. In some cases treaties
were involved. Thus the Louisiana Territory was retroceded or
reconveyed by Spain to France in 1803, and then France, in turn,
transferred the Louisiana Territory to the United States. Thereafter, Louisiana was admitted into the Union as a State under an act
of Congress of 1812, and the first Constitution of Louisiana, of 1812,
was approved by the Congress. Both Spain and France exerted
influence over and claimed, owned, and controlled a marginal belt
as part of the Louisiana Territory, as shown by maps then used and
still in existence.
"Obviously, we must resort to all of such ancient documents in
order to determine the true and actual historic boundaries of each
State, and as a practical matter, that is exactly what this bill permits
and accomplishes. I do not know of any better criteria for the
establishment of the boundaries of the States than a historic
approach." 99 Cong. Rec. 2504.

any doubt could remain that the event of admission is a
vital circumstance in ascertaining the location of boundaries which existed "at the time" of admission within the
meaning of the Submerged Lands Act, it is conclusively
dispelled by repeated statements of its proponents to that
effect.48
We conclude, therefore, that the States' contention that
preadmission boundaries, standing alone, suffice to meet
the requirements of the statute is not tenable.

3. The Question of Executive Policy Respecting the
"Three-Mile Limit."
During consideration of the various "quitclaim" bills
between 1945 and 1953, the suggestion that international
questions might be raised by the bill constantly recurred.
It was asserted that the United States might be embarrassed in its dealings with other nations, first, by permitting States to exercise rights in submerged lands beyond
three miles," and, second, by recognizing that the boundaries of some States might extend beyond three miles from
The first objection was laid to rest by the

47 It is worth observing that at one time the claims protected from
prejudice by ยง 4 included not only those based on state constitutional
or statutory provisions, but also those based on "any treaty ratified
by the Senate of the United States" or on "an act of Congress." 99

Texas' claim based on the Joint Resolution of Annexation (see p. 37,

testimony of Jack B. Tate, Deputy Legal Adviser to the
State Department. Mr. Tate stated that exploitation of
submerged lands involved a jurisdiction of a very special
anid limited character, and he assured the Committee that
assertion of such a jurisdiction beyond three miles would
not conflict with international law or the traditional
United States position on the extent of territorial waters.
He concluded that since the United States had already
asserted exclusive rights in the Continental Shelf as
against the world, the question to what extent those rights
were to be exercised by the Federal Government and to
what extent by the States was one of wholly domestic
concern within the power of Congress to resolve. 1
The second objection, however-that to recognize by
the Act the possible existence of some state maritime
boundaries beyond three miles would embarrass this
country in its dealings with other nations-was persistently pressed by the State Department and by opponents
of the bill. The bill's supporters consistently took the
position that under the Pollardrule as they understood it,
the extent of a State's submerged land rights in. excess of
three miles depended entirely upon the location of its
maritime boundary as fixed by historical events," and
that to the extent a State's boundary had been so fixed
beyond three miles, it constituted an exception to this
country's assumed adherence to the three-mile limit.

were repeatedly asserted as instances where Congress had
made exceptions to the three-mile policy, purportedly
based on the shallowness of waters in the Gulf and the
alleged Spanish custom of claiming three leagues of
53
territorial waters.
The State Department, confronted with this argument,
tenaciously maintained that it had never recognized any
boundaries in excess of three miles." It insisted that by
virtue of federal supremacy in the field of foreign relations, the territorial claims of the States could not exceed
those of the Nation, and that, therefore, if the bill recognized the effectiveness of the relied-on historical events to
fix boundaries beyond three miles despite the State Department's refusal so to recognize them, the bill would
violate this country's consistent foreign policy. The Government now urges in this case a closely similar contention. It says that the Submerged Lands Act did not
establish any formula for the ascertainment of state
boundaries but left them to be judicially determined, and
that because of federal supremacy in the field of foreign
relations, this Court must hold that the Executive policy
of claiming no more than three miles of territorial waters-allegedly in force at all relevant times, and evidenced by the State Department's consistent refusal to
recognize boundaries in excess of three miles-worked a

decisive limitation upon the extent of all state maritime
boundaries for purposes of this Act."5
We agree that the Submerged Lands Act does not con"tain any formula to be followed in the judicial ascertainment of state boundaries, and that therefore, we must
determine, as an independent matter, whether boundaries,
-for purposes of the Act, are to be taken as fixed by historical events such as those pointed to in the Congressional
hearings and debates, or whether they must be regarded
as limited by Executive policy on the extent ofterritorial
waters, as contended by the Government. However, in
light of the purely domestic purposes of the Act, we see
no irreconcilable conflict between the Executive policy
relied on by the Government and .the historical events
claimed to have fixed seaward boundaries for some States
in excess of three miles. We think that the Government's
contentions on this score rest on an oversimplification of
the problem.
A land boundary between two States is an easily understood concept. It marks the place where the full sovereignty of one State ends and that of the other begins.
The concept of a boundary in the sea, however, is a more
elusive one. The high seas, as distinguished from inland
waters, are generally conceded by modern nations to be
55 Similar suggestions seem to have been made in the course of
consideration of the various "quitclaim" bills, though never fully
developed. See 92 Cong. Rec. 9518 (remarks of Senator Connally);

(remarks of Senators Morse and Hill); id., 3270 (remarks of Senator
Hill). See also 1953 Senate Hearings 1078 (remarks of Senator
Daniel). In this Court the Government has undertaken to support
its position respecting this Nation's adherence to the three-mile
limit by a letter from the Secretary of State summarizing historical Executive policy in that regard. In our view of the issues in this
case we do not reach the Government's contention that the Secretary's
letter would be conclusive upon us as to the existence of that policy.

subject to the exclusive sovereignty of no single nation."
It is recognized, however, that a nation may extend its
national authority into the adjacent sea to a limited
distance for various purposes. For hundreds of years,
nations have asserted the right to fish, to control smuggling, and to enforce sanitary measures within varying
distances from their seacoasts. 7 Early in this country's
history, the modern notion had begun to develop that a
country is entitled to full territorial jurisdiction over a belt
of waters adjoining its coast. 8 However, even this jurisdiction is limited by the right of foreign vessels to innocent
passage. 9 The extent to which a nation can extend its
power into the sea for any purpose is subject to the
consent of other nations, and assertions of jurisdiction to
different distances may be recognized for different purposes." In a manner of speaking, a nation which purports to exercise any rights to a given distance in the sea
may be said to have a maritime boundary at that distance.
But such a boundary, even if it delimits territorial waters,
confers rights more limited than a land boundary. It is
only in a very special sense, therefore, that the foreign
policy of this country respecting the limit of territorial waters results in the establishment of a "national
boundary."

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

The power to admit new States resides in Congress.
The President, on the other hand, is the constitutional
representative of the United States in its dealings with
foreign nations. From the former springs the power to
establish state boundaries; from the latter comes the
power to determine how far this country will claim territorial rights in the marginal sea as against other nations.
*Any such determination is, of course, binding on the
States. The exercise of Congress' power to admit new
States, while it may have international consequences, also
entails consequences as between Nation and State. We
need not decide whether action by Congress fixing a
State's territorial boundary more than three miles beyond
its coast constitutes an overriding determination that the
State, and therefore this country, are to claim that much
territory against foreign nations. It is.sufficient for
present purposes to note that there is no question of Congress' power to fix state land and water boundaries as a
domestic matter. Such a boundary, fully effective as
between Nation and State, undoubtedly circumscribes the
extent of navigable inland waters and underlying lands
owned by the State under the Pollard rule. Were that
rule applicable also to the marginal sea-the premise on
which Congress proceeded in enacting the Submerged
Lands Act--it is clear that such a boundary would be
similarly effective to circumscribe the extent of submerged
landg beyond low-water mark, and within the limits of
the Continental Shelf, owned by the State. For, as the
Government readily concedes, the right to exercise jurisdiction and control over the seabed and subsoil of the
Continental Shelf is not internationally restricted by the
limit of territorial waters.
We conclude that, consonant with the purpose of Congress to grant to the States, subject to the three-league
limitation, the lands they would have owned had the
Pollard rule been held applicable to the marginal sea, a

state territorial boundary beyond three miles is established for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act by Congressional action so fixing it, irrespective of the limit of
territorial waters. We turn now to the task of ascertaining what boundary was so fixed for each of the defendant
States.
II.
THE PARTICULAR CLAIMS OF TEXAS.

Texas, the only one of the defendant States which had
the status of an independent nation immediately prior
to its admission, contends that it had a three'league mari-time boundary which "existed at the time [it] became a
member of the Union" in 1845. Whether that is so for
the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act depends upon a
proper construction of the Congressional action admitting
the State to the Union.
Texas declared its independence from Mexico on March
2, 1836, 1 Laws, Republic of Texas, 3-7, and on December
19, 1836, the Texan Congress passed an Act to define its
boundaries, which were described in part as
"beginning at the mouth of the Sabine river, and
running west along the Gulf of Mexico three leagues
from land, to the mouth of the Rio Grande, thence
up the principal stream of said river . . . ." Id.,
133. (Emphasis added.) See diagram at .p. 65,
post. 1
"1The boundaries of Texas were described in full by the Act as
follows:
"That from and after the passage of this act, the civil and political
jurisdiction of this republic be, and is hereby declared to extend to
the following boundaries, to wit: beginning at the nouth of the
Sabine river, and running west along the Gulf of Mexico three leagues
from land, to the mouth of the Rio Grande, thence up the principal
stream of said river to its source, thence due north to the forty-second
degree of north latitude, thence along the boundary line as defined in

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

In March 1837 this country recognized the Republic
of Texas.62 On April 25, 1838, the United States entered
into a convention with the Republic to establish a boundary between the two countries and to provide for a survey
of part of it.63 On April 12, 1844, President Tyler concluded a Treaty of Annexation with the Republic, but on
June 8, 1844, the Senate refused to ratify it." On March
1, 1845, President Tyler signed a Joint Resolution of
Congress for the annexation of Texas, which provided:
"That Cbngress doth consent that the territory properly included within, and rightfully belonging to the
Republic of Texas, may be erected into a new State,
to be called the State of Texas . . . . Said State to
be formed, subject to the adjustment by this government of all questions of boundary that may arise with
other governments .
,21
6..
(Emphasis added.)
Pursuant to this Resolution, the people of Texas adopted
a constitution, which was submitted to Congress, and
by Joint Resolution of December 29, 1845, Texas was
admitted to the Union in accordance with the terms of
the previous Joint Resolution.'
The 1836 Texas Boundary Act remained in force up to the time of admission,
the treaty between the United States and Spain, to the beginning:
and that the president be, and is hereby authorized and required to
open i negotiation with the government of the United States of
America, so soon as in his opinion the public interest requires it, to
ascertain and define the boundary line as agreed upon in said treaty."

be expedient and proper, Cong. Globe, 24th Cong., 2d Sess. 83, 270.

and the State Constitution expressly continued in force
from that time forward all laws of the Republic not
repugnant to the Federal or State Constitution or the
Joint Resolution of Annexation. 7
The Government, while conceding that Texas continuously asserted by statute a three-league seaward boundary, contends that at no time before, during, or after
admission did the United States or any other country
recognize the validity of that boundary. It follows,
therefore, the Government says, that since Texas upon
entering the Union became subject to the foreign policy
of the United States with respect to the' "three-mile
limit," the State's seaward boundary became immediately
and automatically fixed at three miles. Texas, on the
other hand, argues that it effectively established, and that
the United States repeatedly recognized, the State's threeleague boundary before, during, and after admission, and
that therefore such a boundary existed "at the time" of its
admission within the meaning of the Submerged Lands
Act. For reasons already discussed, ante, pp. 24-36, we
consider that the only relevant inquiry is what boundary
was fixed for the State of Texas by virtue of the Congressional action admitting it to the Union in accordance with
the terms of the Joint Resolution of March 1, 1845. This
inquiry first takes us back to some earlier history.
By the Treaty of Paris, signed April 30, 1803,6 France
ceded to the United States the Louisiana Territory. The
extent of the territory thus conveyed was left uncertain,
the description in the Treaty referring only to a previous
treaty by which France had acquired the territory from
Spain, which in turn described the area only as "the
colony or province of Louisiana." 69 It was asserted by

some that the territory acquired did not stop at the Sabine
River-the present boundary between the States of Louisiana and Texas-but extended westward to the Rio
Grande so as to include Texas.!0 However, by the Treaty
of February 22, 1819, between the United States and
Spain, the boundary line between the two countries w.
established at the Sabine. 71 Those who had believed that
the Louisiana Territory extended west of the Sabine
decried this Treaty as a breach of faith by the United
States in violation of the covenant in the 1803 Treaty
which required the inhabitants of all the Louisiana Territory to be incorporated as soon as possible into the
Union."2 Subsequently, the United States attempted
unsuccessfully on several occasions. to acquire the territory west of the Sabine by purchase.73
Meanwhile, Mexico had revolted-from Spain, had been
recognized by this country in 1822, and had proclaimed
a federal constitution in 1824. Texas was made part
of the compound province of Coahuila-Texas, with the
indication that it would eventually be given a separate
constitution as a sovereign state. After a series of difficulties with the central government, however, Texas in

1836 proclaimed its own independence from Mexico. It
immediately sent diplomatic representatives to the United
States to negotiate for annexation, but nothing was
consummated at that time."4 Shortly thereafter, it promulgated the 1836 boundary statute referred to above.
It was against this background that President Tyler
negotiated and sent to the Senate the 1844 Treaty for
the annexation of Texas. That document provided:
"The Republic of Texas . . . cedes to the United
States all its territories, to be held by them in full
property and sovereignty . . . ."
One of the objections made to the Treaty on the floor of

States all the territory claimed by Texas under her 1836
Boundary Act, to large parts of which Texas allegedly
had no title, those parts assertedly having always been
under the domination and control of Spain and Mexico."8
This objection was countered by several proponents of
the Treaty who insisted that since it contained no delineation of boundaries and since the Republic of Texas was
referred to by a general designation, the clause "all its

written by Secretary of State Calhoun to the United
States Charg6 d' Affaires in Mexico a week after the Treaty
was signed, which enjoined the latter, in making the

Rio Grande, that it had extended that far when she was
ceded away by the United States.in 1819, that the United
States had acquiesced in those boundaries when it recognized Texas in 1837, and that Mexico had never protested

boundary."' Senator Breese of Illinois, while assuring the
Treaty's opponents that the boundary was left open to

acknowledged the Texas boundaries as asserted in her

not only of the old province of Texas as it existed in 1803
and 1819, but also "for as much more as the 'republic'
of Texas can lawfully claim." 8 ' Senators Woodbury of

the rejected Treaty had been assailed as purporting to

Annexation Resolution (ante, p. 37) appear, against this
background, to be an express formulation of precisely the
same thing. The first makes it clear that the grant is of
initially,undefined scope, governed by the truism that only
"the territory properly included within, and rightfully
belonging to the Republic of Texas" is ceded. The second
expressly contemplates future negotiation to settle the
exact extent of such territory, by making it "subject to
the adjustment by this government of all questions of
boundary that may arise with other governments." In
short, it is clear that the "properly" and "rightfully"
clause was intended neither as a legislative determination
that the entire area claimed by Texas was legitimately
hers, nor to serve,, independently of the "adjustment"
clause, as a self-operating standard for measuring Texas'
boundaries. Rather, the precise fixation of the new.
State's boundaries was left to future negotiations with
Mexico.
The circumstances surrounding the Resolution's passage make it clear that this was the understanding of
Congress. Congressional attention was focused primarily
on the great political questions attending annexationprimarily the extent to which slavery would be permitted
in the new territory and the possibility that annexation
would embroil this country with Mexico-and the matter
of boundary received little consideration except as it was
related to the larger issues. Public agitation over annexation had become so great that some bills had proposed
annexation virtually in the abstract, with all details to
be worked out later. " Although the Resolution as ulti" Representative Rhett of South Carolina proposed that "the sense
of the . . . [House] be taken on the first number in the series of
resolutions, which simply declared that Texas should be annexed to
the United States." He did not "feel very scrupulous as to the particular means, provided Texas was got; and have it they would."

context, these statements may have meant no more than
that the United States, in its negotiations with Mexico,
would attempt to sustain the full extent of Texas' declared
boundaries, rather than that those boundaries were in
fact proper. Be that as it may, in view of the overwhelming evidence of Congressional understanding and of
the express language of the Annexation Resolution as ultimately passed, the conclusion is inescapable that Texas,
at least as to its land area, was admitted with undefined
boundaries subject to later settlement.
While this conclusion appears unavoidable as regards
Texas' land boundaries, a question does exist as to whether
it applies also to the State's seaward boundary. For we
are unable to find in the Congressional debates either on
the 1844 Treaty or the 1845 Annexation Resolution a
single instance of significant advertence to the problem
of seaward boundaries. Furthermore, a series of other
events manifests a total lack of concern with the problem.
Prior to Texan independence, the United States had
entered into successive treaties with Spain and Mexico,'

Just after Texas had proclaimed its independence from
Mexico, the two'countries, on May 14, 1836, concluded
"Articles of Agreement and Solemn Compact," acknowledging Texan independence and setting its boundary as
follows:
"The line shall commence at the estuary or mouth
of the Rio Grande, on the western bank thereof, and
shall pursue the same bank up the said river .
(Emphasis added.)
Thereafter a 'ministerwas sent to the United States to
seek recognition and broach the subject of annexation.
With respect to the latter, he was instructed on November
18, 1836f

"As regards the boundaries of Texas . . . [w]e
claim and consider that we have possession to the
Rio Bravo del Norte. Taking this as the basis, the
boundary of Texas would be as follows. Beginning
at the mouth of said River on the Gulf of Mexico,
thence up the middle thereof ....
(Emphasis
added.)
Yet a month later, on December 19, 1836, the Texan Congress passed the Boundary Act which inexplicably, so
far as we can find, provided that the boundary should run
along the Gulf of Mexico at three leagues from land."
91 This

compact was alluded to during the debates on the unsuc-

cessful 1844 Treaty as having probably provided the origin of the
boundary claims made in the Texas 1836 boundary statute. See

Quite in contrast, in the subsequent Convention of 1838

Again, as previously mentioned (note 79, ante), during
its consideration of the unratified Treaty of April 12, 1844,
the Senate requested President Tyler to transmi{ -any
information he possessed concerning the southern, southwestern, and western boundaries of Texas. On April 26,
1844, he sent a map and a memoir by its compiler. The
memoir flagrantly misquoted- the 1836 Boundary Act by
accompanying the message was a report dated Aug. 27, 1836, in
which the Texan boundary was described as
"extend[ing] from the mouth of the Rio Grande on the east side,
up to its head waters; thence on a line due north until it intersects
that of the United States, and with that line to the Red river, or
the northern boundary of the United States; thence to the Sabine,
and along that river to its mouth; and from that point westwardly

with the Gulf of Mexico to the Rio Grande." H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 35,

boundary.

,, 9"
The foregoing circumstances make it abundantly plain
that at the time Texas was admitted to the Union, its seaward boundary, though expressly claimed at three leagues
in the 1836 Texas Boundary- Act, had not been the subject of any specific concern in the train of events leading
to annexation.
Given this state of affairs, we must initially dispose of
an argument made by Texas. The State urges, in effect,
that whether or not its maritime boundary was actually
considered by the Congress or the Executive during the
course of the annexation proceedings, it was incumbent
uponthe United States to protest or reject in some manner Texas' claim in this regard, and that failure to do so
constituted in law a validation or ratification of that
boundary claim upon admission. Whatever the merit of
this proposition may be in the abstract, the controlling
factor for purposes of this case must be the terms of the
Joint Resolution of Annexation. There is, indeed, a
strong argument that the "properly," "rightfully," and
"adjustment" clauses of that Resolution should be read
as applying only to the land boundaries disputed with
Mexico, which gave rise to those qualifications, and that
the Resolution was meant to validate any boundary
asserted by Texas without protest. However, in light of
the fact that the language employed in the Resolution is
of general applicability, we should hesitate to limit its
effect by reading into it such an additional unexpressed
test respecting the extent of Texas' boundaries. We
think that its language must be taken as applying to
Texas' maritime boundary as well as to its land boundary.
95 S. Doc. No. 341, 28th Cong., 1st Sess. 55, 56.

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

On this basis an argument of the Government must now
be met. It is contended that since Texas was admitted
to the Union with its maritime boundary not yet settled,
United States foreign policy on the extent of territorial
waters, to which Texas was admittedly subject from the
moment of admission, automatically upon admission operated to fix its seaward boundary at three miles. This
contention must be rejected. As we have noted, the
boundaries contemplated by the Submerged Lands Act
are those fixed by virtue of Congressional power to admit
new States and to define the extent of their territory, noi
by virtue of the Executive power to determine this country's obligations vis-d-vis foreign nations. Ante, pp. 3036. It may indeed be that the Executive, in the exercise
of its power, can limit the enjoyment of certain incidents
of a Congressionally conferred boundary, but it does not
fix that boundary. If, as in the case of Texas, Congress
employs an Uncertain standard in fixing a State's boundaries, we must nevertheless endeavor to apply that
standard .to the historical events surrounding admission.
We are brought back, then, to a twofold inquiry: First.
whether the three-league maritime boundary asserted by
the Republic of Texas embraced an area which was "properly included within, and rightfully belonging to" the
Republic. Second, whether such a boundary was ever
fixed for the State of Texas pursuant to the power reserved
by Congress to adjust "all questions of boundary that
may arise with other governments." As we have observed, it is evident that the first clause, independently
of the second, was not intended to operate as a selfexecuting standard for determining the disputed western
and southwestern boundaries of Texas. To attempt
to apply that clause as fixing the extent of Texas' maritime boundary, immediately upon admission to the
Union, no less than in so fixing its land boundaries,
would be illusory at best. The parties devote consider-

able discussion to the validity or invalidity of the asserted
three-league .naritime boundary under international law.
It is true that the propriety of a nation's seaward boundary must be viewed in the context of its obligations
vis-a-vis the family of nations. But surely the Joint
.Resolution of Annexation could not have been meant to
import such an elusive inquiry into the determination of
Texas' maritim boundary, especially when that question
was never even considered and when the Resolution was
expressly drawn to leave undefined the land boundaries
which did receive consideration. And we are unable to
say that Congress might have deemed the three-league
maritime boundary "proper" or "rightful" in some other
sense. It is necessary, therefore, to look to other events
to ascertain where the Texan maritime boundary was
fixed pursuant to the Joint Resolution of Annexation.
Congress' failure to carry into the Annexation Re,.)ution the boundaries fixed by the 1836 Texas Boundary
Act did not, of course, foreclose the possibility that tile
State's boundary might ultimately be fixed in accordance
with that statute. it is significant in this regard to note
the opinions ventured in Congress on the probable settlement of the boundary with Mexico which would occur
subsequentoto annexation. One group asserted that the
Texan claims to the Rio Grande, particularly the portion
which encompassed New Mexico, could ,not possibly be
maintained." But such remarks were made primarily
by opponents of annexation and were intended as warnings against assuming that enough land would be included
in the cession to pay the Texan debt or to form free States.
Much more significant than opinions as to where the
boundary might ultimately be fixed are observations made

regarding the basis on which the boundary question might
be pressed against Mexico. Supporters and opponents
alike acknowledged that the United States would probably negotiate on the basis of the Texan boundaries as
declared in her own boundary statute, even though some
parts of that boundary might not lVe maintainable. Some
thought this was so because those boundaries were in
fact her proper and rightful boundaries.
Others thought
it was so because the United States, having acquiesced in
the Boundary Act after receiving notice of it, was bound,
upon admitting Texas to the Union, ,to maintain those
claims on her behalf." Whatever the reasons given, it is
Representatiye Haralson of Georgia, speaking to the Joint
Resolution, said:
"If it should turn out that, by receiving the.entire limits of Texas,
as defined in her act, we acquired more territory than we could
rightfully hold, having a just regard to the rights of other nations,
all that is necessary to be done is to surrender the overplus. The
Texian act of Congress, approved December 19, 1836, I have little
doubt, defines correctly the boundary of that republic. If not, any
imaginable difficulty may be adjusted if you adopt one of these
resolutions, which provides for the consent of Texas to our settlement
of the boundaries." Cong. Globe, 28th Cong., 2d Sess., App. 193, 195.
98 Representative Rayner of North Carolina, speaking to the Joint
Resolution, said:
"Texas claims the country on the east of the Del Norte, from its
mouth to its source. She has laid down this as her boundary in her
constitution. She is to transfer to this government, or retain to herself, all the unappropriated lands within the limits of her republic.
She has defined these limits; and it is with Texas, claiming territory
as extending to the Del Norte in its whole length, that you propose
to make the contract. It may be said that this q6estion of boundary
must be left to future negotiation with Mexico. But will not this
government, if Texas is now annexed, with her definition of boundary,
be precluded from making any concessions to Mexico? Will not any
compromise as to boundary be resisted by "Kexas as a breach of faith
towards her? She might say that Texas had defined her own limits;
that with Texas, as thus bounded, we had contracted for her admission into the Union; and that this government was bound by every

clear that Congress, although it purposely refused to settle
the question, anticipated that the Texas Boundary Act
should and would be insisted on to the greatest degree
possible in negotiations with Mexico.
This prediction was borne out by subsequent events.
After the Annexation Resolution had been passed and
transmitted to Texas for its assent, the Mexican army
threatened to cross the Rio Grande and invade Texas.
On June 15, 1845, President Polk wrote an inforinal and
confidential letter to the United States Charg6 d'Affaires
in Texas which indicated that Polk intended to repel such
an invasion and to maintain the Texan claim at least to
the lower portion of the Rio Grande:
"In the. contingency . . . that a Mexican army
4hould cross-the Rio Grande . . . then in my judgconsideration of faith and honor to see that Texas should not be again
mutilated....
"Whether this reasoning be founded in justice or not, there is
some plausibility in it .

Similarly Senator Breese of Illinois, speaking to the 1844 Treaty, had
said:
"The' limits of Texas are to be adjusted hereafter. But we have
acknowledged the limits as defined in the act of the Texian Congress
of 1836, and as delineated on the map accompanying the documents,
as extending to the Del Norte. And why do I say so? Because we
did, in 1837, with a full knowledge of these declared boundaries,
acknowledge the independence of Texas as a state, with that act of
her Congress then, and as now, in full force; and which acknowledgment received the vote of the senator from Missouri. But this is a
small matter, and can be readily adjusted with Mexico, should we
encroach upon her rights. We get a title to all Texas, rightfully
ours in virtue of her sovereignty. We ask no more-no less.

to occupy or devastate any portion of the Texian territory.. Of course I would maintain the Texan title

East of the Rio Grande." Andrew Donelson Papers
(Library of Congress), Vol. 10, folios 2068-2070.
Nine days before, Polk had manifested a similar intention in a letter to Sam Houston, former President of the
Republic of Texas and an influential spokesman for
annexation:
"You may have no apprehensions in regard to your
boundary. Texas once a part of the Union and we
will maintain all-your rights of territory'and will not.
suffer them to be sacrificed." Polk Papers (Library
of Congress) (1845), Vol. 84.
The attitude of the Executive at this time toward the
Texan boundary is made even more explicit by an account
of an interview between the United States Charg6
d'Affaires in .Texas and Sam Houston, written by the
former to his superior, the Secretary of State:
"I stated at large the general policy of the United
States as justifying no doubt of the tenacity with
which they would maintain not only the present
claim of Texas, but reenforce it with the preexisting
one derived from France in 1803 . ...
"I brought also to his view the fact that this latter
feature of the proposals did not interfere with the
right of Texas to define her limits as she claimed
them, in her statutes-that the specification of the
Rio Grande as the western boundary would be proper
enough as shewing the extent to which the United
States would maintain her claim as far as it could be

done without manifest injustice to Mexico, and to the
portion of the inhabitants of Mexico that had never
yet acknowledged the jurisdiction of Texas-that
.,practically the United States would take the place
of Texas, and would be obligated to do all, in this
respect, that Texas could do, were she to remain a
separate nation."
After Texas consented to annexation and Congress had
finally- admitted her to statehood, the Mexican army
crossed the Rio Grande and declared war upon the United
States. On May 11, 1846, President Polk called on Congress to declare war against Mexico. He said in part:
"Texas, by the final action of our Congress, had
become an integral part of our Union. The Con.
oTs of Texas, by its act of December 19, 1836, had
delamdthe Rio del Norte to be the boundary of
that repubTl.
Its jurisdiction had been extended:
and -exe-rcisM beyond the Nueces. The country
between that-river and the Del Norte had been represented in the congress and in the convention of
Texas; had thus taken part in the act of annexation
itself; and is now included within one of our congressional districts. Our own Congress had, moreover, with great -unanimity, by the act approved
:December 31,1845, recognized the country beyond
the Nueces as a part of our territory, by including it
within our own .e'Rvenue system; and a revenue officer,
to reside within that district, has been appointed, by
and with the advice and consent of the Senate. It
becaiie, therefore, of urgent necessity to provide for
the defence of that portion of our country." H. R.

Opinion of the Court.

In a later message to Congress on December 8, 1846,
Polk manifested the same disposition. H. R. Exec.
Doc. No. 4, 29th Cong., 2d Sess. 13-14. And on December
7, 1847, he explained that the United States had rejected
a treaty proposal by Mexico because
"It required the United States to dismember Texas,
by surrendering to Mexico that part of the territory
of that State lying between the Nueces and the Rio
Grande, included within her limits by her laws when
she was an independent republic, and when she was
annexed to the United States and admitted by Congress as one of the States of our Union." H. R. Exec.

However, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that
the Executive, any more than the Congress, was interested
in, or was at all aware of any problem presented by, the
seaward boundary of Texas as claimed in its 1836 Boundary Act. The Government urges, by way of explanation,
that the United States had, by this time, firmly established a policy of claiming no more than three miles of
territorial waters. But the Executive's responsibility for
fixing the Texan boundary derived from a delegation of
Congressional power to admit new States, not from the
Executive's own power to fix the extent of territorial
waters. As we have already pointed out, the two powers
can operate independently, and only the first is determinative in this case. To the extent it may be argued that
the Executive would naturally take account of its own
policy toward territorial waters inflixing the Congressionally mandated boundary, the dta presented to us
are utterly devoid of any suggestior that such was the
case. On the contrary, it is evident that the overwhelming concern of the President and his subordinates
was to maintain to the greatest extent possible the land
boundaries claimed by Texas and disputed with Mexico,

as anticipated by Congress. The settlement of that
matter remained for future events, to which we now turn.
On April 15, i847, Nicholas P. Trist was appointed
Commissioner to Mexico to negotiate a peace treaty.
Among his instructions was a projet of the proposed
treaty, which provided:
"The boundary line between the. two Republics
shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico three leagues
from land opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, from
thence up the middle of that river . . . ." 5 Miller,
Treaties and Other International Acts of the United
States of America (1937), 265. (Emphasis added.)'
This language was incorporated verbatim into Article V
of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as finally signed on
February 2, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, which fixed the boundary
between the United States and Mexico from the Gulf
of Mexico to the Pacific coast.1"ยฐ While there was con10 The treaty provided as follows:

"The boundary line between the two republics shall commence
in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land, opposite the mouth
of the Rio Grande, otherwise called Rio Bravo del Norte, or
opposite the mouth of- its deepest branch, if it should have more
than one branch emptying directly into the sea; from thence up
the middle of that river, following the deepest channel, where it
has more than one, to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico; thence, westwardly, along the whole southern
boundary of New Mexico (which runs north of the town called
Paso) to its western termination; thence, northward, along the
western line of New Mexico, until it intersects' the first branch of
the. river Gila; (or if it should not intersect any branch of that
river; then to the point on the said line nearest to such branch,
and thence in a direct line to the same;) thence down the middle of
the said branch and of the said river, until it empties into the Rio
Colorado; thence across the Rio Colorado, following the division line
between Upper and Lower California, to the Pacific Ocean."
By this treaty, the United States thus not only maintained the
Texan claim to the territory between the Nueces and the.,Rio Grande,
but also acquired from Mexico the whole of New Mexico, part of
which Texas had claimed by its boundary statute. To settle the

siderable disagreement in the negotiations over the various land boundaries, the proposals of both parties never
departed from the three-league provision, See 5 Miller,
op. cit., supra, at 270, 288, 299, 315, 317, 325.
Trist stated-in his notes that one object of instructions
given to his predecessor, substantially identical in relevant
part to those given him, was to get Mexico to agree to a
boundary which
"would throw within the territory of the United
States the country lying east of the Rio Grande. Or,
conflict thus created between the United States
and Texas to that
portion of Nw Mexico, the United States. in 1850 paid Texas
$10,000,000 to relinquish its claim to the area, 9 Stat. 446, thereby
consummating the final step in the establishment of Texas' disputed
land boundaries. See diagram, p. 65, post.
The Act provided as follows:
"The State of Texas will agree that her boundary on the north shall
commence at the point at which the meridian of one hundred degrees
west from Greenwich is intersected by the parallel of thirty-six degrees
thirty minutes north latitude, and shall run from said point due west
to the meridian of one hundred and three degrees west from Greenwich; thence her boundary shall run due south to the thirty-second
degree of north latitude; thence on the said parallel of thirty-two
degrees of north latitude to the Rio Bravo del Norte, and thence with
the channel of said river to the Gulf of Mexico."
It is suggested that the seaward boundary of Texas was thereby
fixed at the edge of the Gulf. But Texas' western boundary south of
New Mexico had already been definitively fixed by the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. Post, pp. 60-61. Since the treaty had fully supported Texas' claim to that area, thexe was nothing to compromise in
1850. By contrast, the portion of the 1848 boundary which encompassed not only eastern New Mexico, to which Texas had a very doubtful claim, but also western New Mexico and California, which it had
never claimed, obviously was not pressed against Mexico on Texas'
behalf and was not intended to validate its claim to eastern New
Mexico. Thus the 1850 Compromise could be concerned only with the
latter area. Nothing in United States v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1, militates
t 9 the contrary. The concluding phrase of the Act, describing the
portion of Texas' boundary south of New Mexico was unnecessary to
the purposes of the Act and could not, without Texas' consent, affect
the seaward boundary previously fixed for it.

as said object stands in said instructions, specifically
stated & expressed, it was the object of prevailing
upon Mexico 'to agree that the line shall be established along the boundary defined by the act of Congress of Texas, approved December 19, 1836, to wit:
beginning at "the, mouth of the Rio Grande; thence
101
up the principal: stream of said river . . .
While this misquotation of'the Texas Boundary Act again
demonstrates total insensitivity to any problem of a seaward boundary, the passage does indicate that the United
States was attempting to follow the Texan statute in
negotiating the boundary."2 More- important for the
purposes of this case are the circumstances that the
three-league provision was made an express part of
the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, that such boundary
was, reaffirmed five years later in the Gadsden Treaty of
December 30' 1853 103 and subsequently in a long line

of international conventions,' and that it has never been
repudiated.
The Treaty unquestionably established the Rio Grande
from New Mexico to the Gulf as the land boundary not
only of the United States but also of Texas, since the
Executive, acting pursuant to the power given by Congress to "adjust" Texas' boundaries in dealings with other
nations, pressed that boundary against Mexico on the
theory that it embraced territory rightfully belonging to
the State of Texas. There is nothing to indicate that the
extension of that boundary three leagues into the Gulf,
pursuant to the very same Boundary Act, was treated on
any different basis. The portion of the boundary extending into the Gulf, like the rest of the line, was intended to
separate the territory of the two countries, and to recognize that the maritime territory of Texas extended three
leagues seaward.

Whether the Treaty be deemed to constitute an exercise
of the power to adjust the boundaries left unsettled by the
1845 Joint Resolution of Annexation, or a post hoc recognition of a seaward boundary which was actually fixed for
Texas upon its admission in 1845, or a fixation of boundaries which related back to the time of admission, is of no
moment. Although the Submerged Lands Act requires
that a State's boundary in excess of three miles must have
existed "at the time" of its admission, that phrase was
intended, in substance, to define a State's present boundaries by reference to the events surrounding its admission. As such, it clearly includes a boundary which was

fixed pursuant to a Congressional mandate establishing
the terms of the State's admission, even though the
final execution of that mandate occurred a short time
subsequent to admission.
The Government contends that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is of no significance in this case because the
line drawn three leagues out to sea was not meant to
separate territory of the two countries, but only to separate their rights to exercise certain types of "extraterritorial" jurisdiction with respect to customs and smuggling. We believe the conclusion .is clear that what
the line, denominated a "boundary" in the Treaty itself,
separates is territory of the respective countries. No
reference to "extraterritorial" jurisdiction is made in
the Treaty, and no such concept can be gleaned from the
context of the negotiations. Being based on the threeleague provision of the 1836 Texas Boundary Act, which
itself denotes a territorial boundary, the obvious and
common-sense meaning of the analogous treaty provision is that it separates the maritime territory of the
United States and Mexico.
The Government relies on certain diplomatic correspondence as evidencing a subsequent construction of the
Treaty contrary to this conclusion. In 1848, when Great
Britain protested the three-league provision of the Treaty,
both the United States and Mexico replied that the Treaty
defined rights only as between the two countries and was
not intended to impair the rights of any other nation in
0
the marginal Sea."'

land, but added a new contention that the boundary provision was "probably" suggested by the Acts of Congress
permitting revenue officials to board vessels bound for the
United States within four leagues of the coast."t ' And in
1936, after Mexico had asserted a three-league belt of
territorial water along its entire coast, the United States,
in denying that the Treaty gave Mexico such a right,
adopted both rationales relied on in 1875, and in addition
contended that the boundary provision did recognize the
territory of the two countries as extending three leagues
from the coast, but only in the "one area" adjacent to the
international boundary."' It seems evident from the
106 Foreign Relations of the United States; 1875, Pt. I, 649-650. It
is difficult to understand why, if jurisdiction for revenue purposes

had been extended by statute to four leagues, the boundary was
established only at three leagues if it was drawn solely for that
purpose. It is asserted, however, that Mexico concluded a series of
treaties with other countries in the latter half of the nineteenth century which established jurisdiction for revenue purposes at three
leagues. Treaty between Mexico and China, Art. XI, 1 Laws and
Regulations on the Regime of the High Seas (United Nations Legislative Series) 147; Treaty between Mexico and the Dominican Republic, Art. 15, id., at 153, 154; Treaty between Mexico and El

Art. VII, id., at 171-172; Treaty between Mexico and the United
Kingdom, Art. IV, id., at 172. Only some of those Treaties set the
limit at three leagues; others set it at twenty kilometers, which is
equivalent to approximately 10.8 nautical miles, or closer to four
leagues than to three. In any event, the Mexican Treaties indicate
only that Mexico chose to limit the rights she would assert as against
other nations, and do not relate to the rights created between it
and the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

shifting and uncertain grounds upon which these pronouncements relied that they should be taken as reflecting
no more than after-the-fact attempts to limit the effect
of a provision which patently purported to establish a
three-league territorial boundary, so as to bring it into
accord with 'this country's international obligations.
Undoubtedly the Elecutive has the right to limit the
effect to be accorded a treaty provision in its dealings with
other countries. But where, as here, that Treaty touches
upon relationships between the Nation and a State
created pursuant to a Congressional mandate, the original
purport of the Treaty must control, and the dealings of
the Executive with other nations cannot affect the State's
rights in any way as a domestic matter.
We conclude, therefore, that pursuant to the Annexation Resolution of 1845, Texas' maritime boundary was
established at three leagues from its coast for domestic
purposes. Of course, we intimate no view on the effectiveness of this boundary as against other nations. Accordingly, Texas is entitled to a grant of three leagues from
her coast under the Submerged Lands Act.
In testifying before Congress on the Submerged Lands Act, representatives of the State Department reiterated these various grounds,
1953 Senate Hearings 1056-1057, 1077-1078. See also id., at 321323, 670; 99 Cong. Rec. 2513-2514, 2569, 2893-2895, 3041-3042.
Their concern was to avert a congressional determination that a
three-league territorial boundary had been fixed for Texas which
might be embarrassing to this country in its foreign relations. However, as we have pointed out, pp. 30-36, ante, there is no necessary
conflict between the existence of a three-league territorial boundary'
for domestic purposes and the maintenance of the Executive's policy
on the limit to which this country will assert rights in the marginal
seas as against other nations. Despite the State Department's contentions with. respect to the Treaty, Congress Nparly left that question,
like all other matters bearing on the determn tion of boundaries, an
open question to be judicially resolved.

III.
THE PARTICULAR CLAIMS OF LOUISIANA.

Louisiana's claims, like those of Texas,. are based on
the contention that it had a three-league maritime boundary which existed "at the time" it was admitted to the
Union, and must be judged by the same standards. The
Act of Congress admitting the State to the Union in
1812 $oa described the new State's boundaries as follows:
"beginning at the mouth of the river Sabine; thence,
by a line to be drawn along the middle 'of said river,
including all islands to the thirty-second degree of
latitude; thence, due horth, to the northernmost part
of the thirty-third degree of north latitude; thence,
along the said parallel of latitude, to the river Mississippi; thence, down the said river, to the river
Iberville; and from thence, along the middle of the
said river, and lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to
the gulf of Mexico; thence, bounded by the said gulf,
to the place of beginning, including all islands within
three leagues of the coast .... " (Emphasis added.)
Louisiana claims that the concluding clause "including
all islands within three leagues of the coast" should be
read to mean that Congress fixed as the State's seaward
boundary a line three leagues from its coast, and that such
a reading is supported both by the State's preadmission
history and by subsequent events. The Government, on
the other hand, insists that the phrase includes only the
islands themselves lying within three leagues of the coast,
anc not all waters within that distance as well. 8

101 In precise modern usage, the term "shore" denotes the line of
low-water mark along the mainland, while the term "coast" denotes

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

1. The Act of Admission on Its Face.
The language of the Act itself appears clearly to support the Government's position. The boundary line is
drawn down the middle of the river Iberville "to the gulf
of Mexico," not into it for any distance. The State is
thence to be bounded "by the said gulf," not by a line
located three leagues out in the Gulf, "to the place of
beginning," which is described as "at the mouth of the
river Sabine," not somewhere beyond the mouth in the
Gulf. (Emphasis added.) And while "all islands" within
the line of the shore plus the line where inland waters meet the open
sea. It is obvious that the term "coast" was used in Louisiana's
Act of Admission in a nontechnical sense to denote what is actually
the shore. The Acts admitting both Mississippi and Alabama contain
similar provisions for the inclusion of all islands within six leagues
of the shore, despite the fact that Great Britain had proclaimed those
areas in 1763 to include all islands within six leagues of the "sea
coast." And, in Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S. 1, 47, this Court
held that the "coast" referred to in Louisiana's Act of Admission was
the St. Bernard marshes on the mainland and not the Chandeleur
Islands, which might be thought to be the seaward limit of inland
waters.
The Government concedes that all the islands which are within
three leagues of Louisiana's shore and therefore belong to it under
the terms of its Act of Admission, happen to be so situated that
the waters between them and the mainland are sufficiently enclosed
to constitute inland waters. Thus, Louisiana is entitled to the lands
beneath those waters quite apart from the affirmative grant of the
Submerged Lands Act, under the rule of Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3
How. 212. Furthermore, since the islands enclose inland waters, a line
drawn around those islands and the intervening waters would constitute the "coast" of Louisidna within the definition of the Submerged Lands Act. Since that Act confirms to all States rights
in submerged lands three miles 'from their coasts, the Government
concedes that Louisiana would be entitled not only to the inland
waters enclosed by the islands, but to an additional three miles
beyond those islands as well. We do not intend, however, in passing
on these motions, to settle the location of the coastline of Louisiana
or that of any other State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.

three leagues of the coast were to be included, there is
no suggestion that all waters within three leagues were to
be embraced as well. In short, the language of the Act
evidently contemplated no territorial sea whatever.
Similar language was employed in the Treaty of Paris
of September 3, 1783, by which Great Britain recognized
the independence of the United States."ยฐ After describing
the boundary of the United States from the mouth of the
St. Croix River in the Bay of Fundy to the mouth of the
St. Mary's River between Georgia and Florida, the parties
added: "comprehending all islands within twenty leagues
of any part of the shores of the United States . . . ." In
the light of Jefferson's olservation, only 10 years later,
that national claims to control of the sea beyond approximately 20 miles from the coast had not theretofore been
generally recognized among maritime powers; " his
accompanying proposal that a three-mile limit should be
placed upon the extent of territorial waters; "' and subsequent American and British policy in this regard, see note
54, supra, it is hardly coa ceivable that this provision of the
Treaty was intended to establish United States territorial
jurisdiction over all waters lying within 20 leagues
(60 miles) of the shore. 1 ' No reason appears for reading

112 While, as we have observed, Congress may fix state boundaries
independently of Executive policy on the extent of territorial waters,
subject to any limitations imposed by that policy, the Treaty of
Paris does not present such a situation. It represents an exercise
of purely Executive power (prior, in fact, to the establishment of
the Federal Constitution) in setting a national boundary with another
nation.

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

the Louisiana statute differently. The conclusion that
language claiming all islands within a certain distance of
the coast is not meant to claim all the marginal sea to
that distance is further confirmed by the Act defining the
boundaries of Georgia,' which claims three miles of
marginal sea but all islands within 20 leagues of the coast.
That Act provides:
"along the middle of [the St. Mary's] river to the
Atlantic Ocean, and extending therein three English
miles from low-water mark; thence, rurining in a
northeasterly direction and following the direction of
the Atlantic coast to a point opposite the mouth, or
inlet, of said Savannah River; and from thence to the
mouth or inlet cf said Savannah River, to the place
of beginning; including all the lands, waters, islands,
and jurisdictional rights within said limits, and also
all the islands within 20 marine leagues of the
seacoast."
Nothing in the case of Alaska PacificFisheriesv. United
States, 248 U. S.78, tends toward a contrary construction.
The Court there held that an Act of Congress designating
as an Indian reservation "the body of lands known as
Annette Islands" included the intervening and surrounding waters and submerged lands, which were inland waters
admittedly under the control of the United States,
whether actually part of the reservation or riot. The
Court, construing the statute in light of the Indians'
historic use of these waters as fishing grounds, merely
concluded that Congress intended to include in the area
reserved the waters and water bed, as well as the islands,
referring to both "as a single body of lands." Id., 89.

in contrast, sweep within the State's jurisdiction waters
and submerged lands which bear no proximate relation to
any islands, and which would otherwise be part of the
high seas.
Louisiana also contends, relying on United States v.
Texas, 162 U. S..1; Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S. 1,
that this Court has already determined that its boundary
includes three leagues of marginal sea. The Texas case,
however, involved only the question whether Greer
County, in the northwest part of the State, was properly
a part of Texas. And even if that case had effectively
established a three-league maritime boundary for Texas,
which quite evidently it did not, that would not establish
a similar boundary for Louisiana.
The Mississippi case involved only the issue of the
boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana
relies on the holding of the Court that because the eastern
boundary of Louisiana was a water boundary along the
middle of the river Iberville, extending to the Gulf, it
went on to include a deep-water sailing channel in the
Gulf adjacent to Mississippi. It also relies on a rough
map included in the Court's opinion showing a line drawn
all the way around the State's coast at some distance in
the Gulf. There is, however, no indication whatever
that the line so indicated bore any relation to the threel
league provision in the Louisiana Act of Admission.
Furthermore, if there could be. any doubt that only the
portion of the water boundary adjacent to Mississippi was
considered by the Court, it is dispelled by the Court's
statement that

"Questions as to the breadth of the maritime belt or
the extent of the sway of the riparian States require
no special consideration here. The facts render such
discussion unnecessary." Id., 52.

2. Preadmission History.
Preliminarily, it should be observed that in light of what
has already been said, pp. 24-30, ante, Louisiana's'preadmission history is relevant in this case only to the extent
that it aids in construing the Louisiana Act of Admission.
The thrust of the State's argument on this score is that
the boundaries fixed by the Act of Admission comprised
the entire area acquired by the United States from France
through the Louisiana Purchase, effected by the Treaty
of Paris in 1803; that the extent of this area traces back,
through cessions by France to Spain in 1762 and Spain to

that this

the southerly limit of his claim-. His expression of belief
that the river-mouth was at "about" the 27th parallel
does not indicate an intent to claim to that parallel, which
is in fact some 120 miles south of the Mississippi's mouth.
In any event, the proc~s-verbal of Jacques de la M~tairie,
notary of the La Salle expedition,'15 shows that the proclamation was issued after the mouth of the Mississippi had
been reached and the party had returned upstream only
far enough to find solid ground for the erection of a monument, and that La Salle then thought, mistakenly in fact,
that they. were at about the 27th parallel. , Other documents also indicate that the river mouth defined the extent
of the claim and that the territory included no marginal

either of these Treaties to indicate that France or Spain
claimed any territorial sea.
3. Louisiana argues, however, that certain treaties
between France, Spain, and other nations evidence such
an intent. Four of these treaties concern the right of the
French to fish within certain distances of the coasts of
the British possessions in North America, varying from
three to 30 leagues. The relevant portions do not relate
to French or Spanish territory at all.1 '9 In another, Great
Britain undertook not to permit its subjects to navigate
or fish within 10 leagues of coasts occupied by Spain "in
the Pacific Ocean, or in the South Seas," so as to prevent
illicit trade with Spanish settlements. 2 ' The Treaty does
not relate to the area in question, and, far from being an
assertion of a territorial claim by Spain, imposed an obligation of a limited nature on Great Britain alone. The
same reasoning applies to another of these treaties, the
Treaty between Spain and Tripoli, signed September 10,
1794, prohibiting the capture of any vessel within 10
leagues from coasts of the dominions of Spain.2 1 Reliance is also placed on an ordinance promulgated by
Philip II of Spain in October 1565, asserting rights
within the visual horizon of the coasts of Spain and its possessions.' 22 It may be questioned whether this ordinance

even constituted an assertion of territorial jurisdiction as
it is known today, especially in view of the fact that the
concept of the territorial sea did not arise in international
law until after this country achieved its independence.
See United States v. California,supra, 32-33. Even if it
did, the ordinance can hardly be taken as applying to a
territory not acquired by Spain until 200 years later or as
affecting the construction of the Act admitting Louisiana
to the Union 250 years later.' 3
4. By the Treaty of Paris, signed April 30, 1803, France
ceded to the United States the Louisiana Territory with
all its rights and appurtenances "as fully and in the same
manner as they have been acquired by the French
Republic, in virtue of the above-mentioned treaty*[Treaty
of San Ildefonso, Oct. 1, 1800], concluded with his Catholic
Majesty," incruding "the adjacent islands belonging to
Louisiana." 124 To show that the Act admitting Louisiana
to the Union must be construed as referring directly to
this Treaty, Louisiana relies on Article III of the Treaty,
which required the United States to admit "the ceded
territory" to statehood as soon as possible. But since
the historic documents to which our attention has been
called fail to show that the ceded territory included any
territorial sea, taking the Treaty as defining the scope
of the Act of Admission only confirms the view that
Louisiana's maritime boundary was fixed at, and not
somewhere in, the Gulf of Mexico.
123

Certain correspondence between the United States and Spain

involving a dispute over the eastern and western limits of Louisiana
also indicates that Spain believed the territory ended at. the Gulf
of Mexico. Letter from Pedro Cevallos, Spanish Foreign Minister,

Opinion of the Court.

5. Louisiana also asserts that about the time of its admission, the United States was claiming three leagues of
territorial waters in the Gulf, and that the Act of Admission was framed with reference to that claim. However,
from the great variety of documentation presented by the
parties, the most that could possibly be said is that the
United States, contrary to the Government's contention,
had not unequivocally asserted the applicability of the
three-mile limit in the Gulf of Mexico. Assuming, as the
defendants have here argued, that it would have been reasonable under international law for the United States to
claim three leagues of territorial waters in the Gulf had it
so chosen, we nevertheless cannot conclude that Congress
meant to define Louisiana's boundaries by reference to
a rule which was the subject of so much difference among
nations and which had never been adopted by this country.
The terms of the Act of Admission seem to point so
strongly to the contrary that it would require much more
convincing evidence than this to persuade us that the construction advanced by Louisiana is correct. Furthermore,
it is significant that only a few years later, Congress
admitted Mississippi and Alabama to the Union, describing their boundaries as including all islands within six
leagues of the shore. See pp. 81, 82, post. If the threeleague provision in Louisiana's Act of Admission was
intended to reflect a policy of claiming three leagues of
territorial waters, it is difficult to understand why Congress, so shortly thereafter, should have incorporated a
six-league limit in an otherwise identical provision.
3. Postadmission Events.
To the extent that Louisiana's reliance on postadmission events is for the purpose of showing that the United
States established a three-league "national boundary"
in the Gulf, they cannot help her case, for reasons previously discussed. Ante, pp. 30-36. We need not decide
whether the United States ever claimed three leagues of

OCTOBER TERM, 1959.
Opinion of the Court.

363 U. S.

territorial waters along the entire Gulf coast, which could
in a sense be said to constitute a national boundary, or
whether, if it did, Louisiana would have been entitled to
extend its own boundary to that distance. Under the
Submerged Lands Act, Louisiana's boundary must be
measured at the time of her admission, unless a subsequent
change was approved by Congress. If the Act of Admission fixed the boundary at the shore, neither action
by Congress fixing greater boundaries for other States nor
Executive policy on the extent of territorial waters could
constitute Congressional approval of a maritime boundary
for Louisiana. Louisiana, however, insists that certain
of these events -subsequent to admission must be considered in construing the Act of Admission.
1. We are urged to infer that since, as the Court today
holds, three-league boundaries were fixed for Texas (ante,
p. 64) and Florida (post, p. 121), and since, after Texas'
admission, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo fixed the
starting point of the boundary between the United States
and Mexico at three leagues in the Gulf, Congress must
have meant to treat Louisiana equally. The inference
must be based primarily on the existence of the Texas and
Florida boundaries, for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
relates only to the boundary between Texas and Mexico,
and tends to prove nothing more than the existence of a
three-league boundary for Texas. In view of the fact
that shortly after Louisiana's admission, Congress fixed
maritime boundaries for Mississippi and Alabama which,
even on Louisiana's construction, would be different than
three leagues, we can discern no consistent Congressional
policy toward the maritime boundaries of the Gulf States
at the time of Louisiana's admission, even if the much
later actions with respect to Texas and Florida could be
thought to have established such a policy. Cf. Louisiana v. Mississippi,supra, at 41. It would require clear
evidence that such a policy was operative at the time

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
1

Opinion of the Court.

Congress passed the Act admitting Louisiana to overcome
language in that Act which points so strongly against the
construction urged by Louisiana. Nor does the concept
of equal footing require such a construction. While the
ownership of certain lands within state boundaries has
been held to be an inseparable attribute of the political
sovereignty guaranteed equally to all States, see United
States v. Texas, 339 U. S., at 716, the geographic extent of
those boundaries, and thus of the lands owned, clearly has
nothing to do with political equality. A fortiori this is
true in the case of maritime boundaries beyond low-water
mark, since, except as granted by Congress, the States do
not own the lands beneath the marginal seas. See United
States v. California,supra; Alabama v. Texas, supra.
2. Certain treaties successively entered into from 1819
to 1838 by the United States with Spain, Mexico, and the
Republic of Texas establishing the boundary between
Texas and the United States are relied on as indicating
that the State and Federal Governments thought that
Congress had fixed a three-league maritime boundary for
Louisiana. 25 Louisiana contends that the treaties fixed
the beginning of the international boundary at a point
three leagues frcdm land, and that therefore the southwestern corner of Louisiana as well as the southeastern
corner of Texas must have been regarded as extending
seaward to that distance. Whether or not such reasoning is valid, the language of the treaties refutes the premise
that the international boundary began three leagues from
land. Both the 1819 and the 1828 treaties recited that
"[t] he boundary line betweenthe two countries, west of
Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits (between the United
States and Spain), Feb. 22, 1819, 8 Stat. 252; Treaty of Limits (between the United States and Mexico), Jan. 12, 1828, 8 Stat. 372;

the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulph of Mexico, at the
mouth of the river Sabine, in the sea . . ."
The Treaty
of 1838 referred to the Treaty of 1828, and provided for
a survey of "that portion of the said boundary which
extends from the mouth of the Sabine, where that river
enters the Gulph of Mexico, to the Red river." 126
3. In its answer to the original complaint, Louisiana
alleged certain acts of sovereignty over the marginal sea
and seabed and the acquiescence of the Federal Government therein.'
Although it has now abandoned its
earlier contention that these acts establish its title by
prescription and estoppel apart from the Submerged
Lands Act, it now urges that they indicate a subsequent
practical construction of Louisiana's Act of Admission.
Taking these facts as proved, they do not have the effect
urged by Louisiana. They indicate only that until the
1930's, the Federal Government may have believed that
lands beneath the marginal sea belonged to the States.
There is no allegation that the geographical extent of
Louisiana's assertions, assuming that'such assertions were
made beyond three miles, was drawn in question, or that
the question of Louisiana's boundary was considered.
Some of the acts alleged constituted police power meas126

See note 94, supra.

Among the acts alleged were "the passing and enforcing of laws
regulating fishing, trawling .and dredging of said submerged lands,
the granting of leases for the cultivation, propagation and taking
of oysters, fish and shrimp, for the dredging and removal of sand,
gravel and shells, and for the leasing and development of said lands
for oil, gas and other minerals." The answer further alleged that
prior to the discovery of oil and gas under said lands, the United
States had never claimed any interest in them, and that it had
recognized Louisiana's title thereto when, on numerous occasions, it
"requested the Chief Executive of the State to secure the passage
of laws which would permit the federal government to acquire sites
therein for game and fish preserves and for light houses, jetties and
other aids to navigation."
127

UNITED STATES v. LOUISIANA.
Opinion of the Court.

ures which a State can enforce against its citizens beyond
its boundaries. Skiriotes v. Florida,313 U. S. 69. As to
acts touching the development of the submerged lands
themselves, the United States would have had no reason
to object to activity beyond Louisiana's boundary, since
not until 1945 did the Federal Government assert any
rights in the Continental Shelf for itself. If any of the
other acts alleged conflicted with this Nation's policy
toward territorial waters, objection would have lain
regardless of the location of the State's boundary, and
lack of objection is therefore, for the purposes of this case,
inconclusive.
4. Finally, Louisiana relies on a 1954 statute of its own
establishing the State's boundary at three leagues seaward of the line between inland and open waters. Act 33
of 1954, La. Rev. Stat. 49:1. It is said that in so legislating Louisiana followed the coastline as defined in regulations promulgated by the Commandant of the Coast
Guard, pursuant to the Federal Act of February 19, 1895,
28 Stat. 672, 33 U. S. C. ยง 151, and that because of this,
and also on considerations of convenience and certainty,
this state enactment should be accepted as establishing
Louisiana's coast. We think the consideration of this
contention should be postponed to a later stage of
this case. We decide now only that Louisiana is entitled
to submerged-land rights to a distance no greater than
three geographical miles from its coastlines, wherever
those lines may ultimately be shown to be.

THE PARTICULAR CLAIMS OF MISSISSIPPI.

Mississippi's claim to a three-league seaward boundary
must fail largely for the same reasons that have led us
to reject the similar claim of Louisiana.

OCTOBER' TERM, 1959.
Opinion of the Court.

363 U. S.

The territory which now comprises the part of Mississippi lying south of the 31st parallel was originally
ceded by France to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris
of February 10, 1763.28 Great Britain designated this
territory part of West Florida, and by proclamation
of October 7, 1763, King George III described West
Florida as
"bounded to the southward by the gulf of Mexico, including all islands within six leagues of the
coast, from the river Apalachicola to Lake Pontchartrain ....""I
On September 3, 1783, Great Britain and Spain signed
a treaty by which Great Britain ceded this area to Spain
as part of a cession embracing all of western and eastern
Florida.3 '
By the Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed October 1, 1800,
Spain ceded to France "the colony and province of Louisiana." See p. 72, ante. In the Treaty of Paris of April
'30, 1803, France ceded Louisiana to the United States
to the same extent as France had acquired it by virtue
of the Treaty of San Ildefonso. See p. 74, ante. A
dispute arose between the United States and Spain as
to whether, by the Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain had
conveyed to France any land east of the Mississippi
River (including any part of West Florida), and therefore whether France could have subsequently passed that
territory to the United States in the Treaty of Paris.

made it part of the Mississippi Territory." 2 On March 1,
1817, Congress authorized the creation of the State of
Mississippi, specifically setting out its boundaries, in part
as follows:
"thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico, thence westwardly, including all the islands within six leagues of
the shore, to the most eastern junction of Pearl river
with Lake Borgne ... ." 133 (Emphasis added.)
The Mississippi Constitution, approved by the Act
admitting the State to the Union on December 0, 1817,8'
contained an identical provision. Finally, by the Treaty
of February 22, 1819, Spain purported to cede East and
West Florida to the United States. 8 Stat. 254. It
was determined, however, in Foster v. Neilson, .2Pet.
253, that the portion of the State of Mississippi south of
-the 31st parallel passed to the United States As part of the
Louisiana Purchase under the Treaty of Paris in 1803,
and not as part of West Florida under the Spanish Treaty
of 1819.
We have already held with respect to Louisiana's claim
to a three-league maritime boundary that an Act of Admission which refers to all islands within a certain distance of the shore does not appear on its face to mean
to establigh a boundary line that distance from the shore,
including all waters and submerged lands as well as all
islands. There is nothing in Mississippi's history, just
as there is nothing in Louisiana's, to cause us to depart
from that conclusion in this instance. Indeed, Mississippi relies almost entirely on the fact that the very
language which defeats its contention was. repeatedly
used, in the 1763 Proclamation by King George III,
in the. Congressional Enabling Act, and in the State
Constitution, and was implicitly incorporated in mesne
conveyances.

Mississippi also urges that the draftsmen of the provision must have intended to inlude all waters and submerged lands within six leagues from shore because the
waters are very shallow and the islands are constantly
shifting. This argument, however, appears only to
strengthen the conclusion that it was islands upon which
the provision focused, and not waters where there were
no islands.
We must hold that Mississippi is not entitled to rights
in submerged lands lying beyond three geographical miles
from its coast.'
V.
THE PARTICULAR

CLAIMS OF ALABAMA.

The preadmission history of Alabama is essentially the
same as that of Mississippi, the portion of the State lying
south of the 31st parallel having passed by the same
mesne conveyances from France to the United States.
That portion was incorporated into the Mississippi Territory by the Act of May 14, 1812,"' and became a part of
the State of Alabama formed out of that territory. Its
Act of Admission 187incorporated the Enabling Act, which
described its boundary in part as follows:
"thence, due south, to the Gulf of Mexico; thence,
eastwardly, including all islands within six leagues
of the shore, to the Perdido river .... "I
The same reasons applicable to the claims of Louisiana
and Mississippi compel us to hold that Alabama is not
entitled to rights in submerged lands lying beyond three
geographical miles from its coast.3 9

VI.
CONCLUSIONS.

On the basis of what has been said in this opinion, we
reach the following conclusions:
1. As to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, a decree will be entered (1) declaring that the
United States is-entitled, as against these States, to all the
lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the
Gulf of Mexico more than three geographical miles from
the coast of each such State, that is, from the line of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters, and
extending seaward to the edge of the Continental Shelf;
(2) declaring that none of these States is entitled to any
interest in such lands,:minerals, and resources; (3) enjoining these States from interfering with the rights of the
United States therein; (4) directing each such State
appropriately to account to the United States for all sums
of money derived therefrom subsequent to June 5,
1950; 140 and (5) dismissing the cross bill of the State of
Alabama.14 1
140 On Juue 5, 1950, the date of this .Court's decision in the Louisiana and Texas cases, all coastal States were put on notice that the
United States was possessed of paramount rights in submerged lands
lying seaward of their respective coasts. The Submerged Lands Act,
passed in 1953, by which parts of those lands were relinquished to the
States, also forgave any monetary claims arising out of the States'
prior use of the lands so relinquished. But the United States remains
entitled to an accounting for all sums derived since June 5, 1950, from
lands not so relinquished.
Mississippi contends that it is not liable for an accounting, since it
was never party to a suit decreeing the United States' rights in
offshore lands. However, principles announced in the 1950 Louisiana
and Texas cases are plainly applicable to all coastal States, and Mississippi was put on notice by the decrees in those cases. A fortiori,

2. As to the State of Texas, a decree will be entered
(1) declaring that the State is entitled, as against" the
United States, to the lands, minerals, and other natural
resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico to a distance of
three lAgues from Texas' coast, that is, from the line of
ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters;
(2) declaring that the United States is entitled, as against
Texas, to no interest therein; (3) declaring that the
United States is entitled, as against Texas, to all such
lands, minerals, and resources lying beyond that area,
and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf;
(4) enjoining the State from interfering with the rights of
the United Statps therein; and (5) directing Texas appropriately to account to the United States for all sums of
money derived since June 5, 1950, from the area to which
the United States is declared to be entitled.
3. Jurisdiction over this case will be retained for such
further proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the
rights adjudicated herein.
4. The motions of Louisiana and Mississippi to take
depositions and present evidence are denied, without
prejudice to their renewal in such further proceedings as
may be had in connection with matters left open by this
opinion."4 2 In so deciding we have not been unmindful of
this Court's liberality in original cases of "allowing full
development of the facts." -See United -States v. Texas,
339 U. S. 707, 715. We think, however, that the conclusions to be drawn from the historical documents relied on
the similar contention' .of Louisiana, the defendant in the 1950
Louisiana case, must be overruled.
,141 In fight of these-conclusions we do not reach the question whether
A abama's cross bill, constitutes an "unconsented" suit against the
United States.
142 The same disposition. is made'of the similar averment in Alabama's a'swer. Texas' motion for similar relief and for a severance
is rendered moot by our decision as to it.

see no need to postpone the adjudication of the issues now

passed in 1953. Two bills previously passed by Congress, substantially the same as the 1953 Act, were vetoed
by the President.' After the first veto we refused to
hold that California, Texas and Louisiana owned or
had ever owned legal title to the submerged lands adjacent to their coasts. We held that the United States,
not the States, had paramount rights in and power over
such lands and their products, including oil.' Congress
accepted our holdings as declaring the then-existing lawthat these States had never owned the offshore landsbut believed that all coastal States were equitably entitled
to keep all the submerged lands they had long treated as
their own,4 without regard to technical legal ownership
or boundaries. Accordingly, Congress exercised its power
by passing the Submerged Lands Act in an attempt to
restore the "rights and powers of the States and those

arguments, strongly supported by evidence and concessions, Congress did not limit its grant to the Gulf States

Alabama v. Texas, 347 U. S.272.
The statute neither defines the kind of "boundary"
which is to measure Congress' grants to these States, nor
particularizes the criteria for deciding it. We may agree
with the Government that the term "boundary" was used
here in its usual sense to mean the limit of territory, which,
in the case of a coastal boundary, Would mean the outer
limit of the territorial sea. But this does not get us very
far in determining the location of these States' boundaries. For a number of reasons I cannot accept the Government's contention that each State must show a "legal"
or "legally accepted" boundary as of the date it became
a member of the Union. I cannot see. how we can be
expected retroactively to reconstruct a technically defined
legal boundary, extending out into the lands under the
Gulf, if the States never technically owned any of these
lands. In United States v. California,332 U. S.19, and
the cases which followed it, this Court held that the States
of California, Texas and Louisiana did not own or have
title to the offshore lands they claimed. If we were now
to hold that these States must prove technical title as of
the early 1800's in order to satisfy the Submerged Lands
Act and that they have succeeded in doing so, we would
in effect be overruling our prior cases, cases expressly
accepted by Congress as declaring the law when the 1953
Act was passed. I cannot believe that Congress intended
us to try to use again the same "legal" test of ownership

we had applied in holding that the States did not own
any part of their marginal lands, particularly since Congress passed the 1953 Act to allow the States' rights to be
determined under established equitable, not strictly legal,
principles. The opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS forcefully points out the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of
.inding that any of these States ever had a technical legal
boundary out .in the ocean. Even if a technical determination of boundaries were intended by Congress, rather
than attempt that impossible task, I would prefer to
return the Act to Congress for a more precise expression
of its will. Cf. United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U. S. 40, 54 (concurring opinion); Northwestern Bands of Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324
U. S. 335, 354-358 (concurring opinion).
Moreover, the Submerged Lands Act prescribes no
standards for determining a strictly "legal" boundary
according to the conveyancer's art. There are, of course,
no markers out in the Gulf of Mexico to show where the
boundaries were when the States were admitted. Since
some were admitted anywhere from 140 to 150 years -ago
there are no living witnesses to testify where their boundaries were at that time. But despite these difficulties, it
is our duty to give effect to the congressional act as best
we can. It is therefore my view that since we cannot
1ok to legalistic tests of title, we must look to the claims,
understandings, expectations and uses of the States
throughout their history. This is because of the congressional expressions, stated time and time again that
the Act's purpose was to restore to the States what Congress deemed to have been their historical rights and
powers. Nor can I accept the Government's argument
that these States' interests in the marginal seas must be
determined in accord with the national policy of foreign
relations. Everything in the very extended congressional
hearings and reports refutes any such idea. Instead,

Congress saw it
In determining the boundaries of these
States, we must, I think, recognize and follow the same
principles if we are to effectuate the congressional purpose that produced this Act. That is what I would do.
A few, references to the legislative background will illustrate the guides Congress intended we should apply in
interpreting its Act.
Senator Ellender of Louisiana invoked the equitable
sense of Congress.' Senator Holland of Florida, the
author of the bill, urged Congress to "look into the equi8 Under the heading, "Equity best served by establishing 'State
ownership," the earlier Senate Report incorporated in the Report on
the 1953 Act summarizes the equitable features involved:
"The repeated assertions by our highest Court for a period of
more than a century of the doctrine of State ownership of all navigable waters, whether inland or not, and .the universal belief that such

principle which the committee believes should as a matter of policy
be recognized and confirmed by Congress as a nile of property law.

treated these lands as their property in their sovereign capacities;
that the States and their grantees have invested large sums of money
in such lands; that the States have received, and anticipate receiving
large income from the use thereof, and from taxes thereon; that the
bonded indebtedness, school funds, and tax structures of several States
are largely dependent upon State ownership of these lands; and that
the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Federal Government have always considered and acted upon the belief that these
lands were the properties of the sovereign States.

ties and the moral considerations that are involved... 10
The presiding officer of the Senate Committee, who conducted the hearings and reported the bill, told the Congress that "justice, equity, and the best interests of the
Nation will be served by the enactment of this legislation." 11 The Senate Committee Report on an earlier bill,
printed and adopted as a part of the Report on the 1953
Act, declared .that "The Congress, in the exercise of its
policy powers, is not and should not be confined to the
same technical rules that bind the courts in their determination of legal rights of litigants.

.

.

. The com-

mittee believes that, as a matter of policy in this instance,
the same equitable principles and high standards that
apply between individuals, should be applied by Congress
as between the National Government and the sovereign
states." 1 The very last paragraph of the report on the
bill referred to it as "an act of simple justice to each of
the 48 States in that it reestablishes in them as a matter
of law that possession and control of the lands beneath
navigable waters inside their boundaries which have
existed in fact since the beginning of our Nation. It is
not a gift; it is a restitution."' 2
Congress has thus, repeatedly emphasized its desire to
have the States! rights in these submerged lands determined not under "technical rules" but, as the Senate Committee said, in accordance with "equitable principles and
high standards"' of justice.14 To point out specifically

what it meant, that Committee referred to three similar
cases of this Court. One, which is illustrative, was
Indianav. Kentucky, 136 U. S. 479.15

That case involved

a boundary dispute between Indiana and Kentucky.
The crucial question was the determination in 1890 of
the location of the Kentucky boundary when Kentucky
became a State in 1792. That same kind of backwardlooking determination of boundaries is involved here
with reference to the Gulf States. In the IndianaKentucky case, as here, there were no satisfactory
markers, and testimony of living witnesses was deemed
to be of little value. There was much evidence in the
Indiana-Kentucky case, however, that Kentucky had
exercised authority over the disputed territory since it
first became a State and that Indiana had never challenged the boundary or the authority of Kentucky.
Emphasizing the great value of that evidence this Court
said: "This long acquiescence in the exercise by Kentucky
of dominion and jurisdiction over the island is more
potential than the recollection of all the witnesses produced on either side. .

.

. It is a principle of public law

universally recognized, that long acquiescence in the possession of territory and in the exercise of dominion and
sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the nAtion's title and
rightful authority." 136 U. S., at 510. The Court went
on to quote the following from Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639, "For the security of rights,
whether of States or individuals, long possession under a
claim of title is protected. And there is no controversy in which this great principle may be invoked with
greater justice and propriety than in a case of disputed
boundary." 136 U. S., at 511.

Accepting, as I think we should, the desire of Congress
to have the ancient boundaries of these Gulf States determined on the basis of their long-unchallenged claims,
rather than by the'use of subtle and refined legal inferences, I am led to the conclusion that the other Gulf
States, as well as Texas, are entitled to prevail over the
Government here. It is admitted that prior to 1937 the
United States never claimed any title to, or exercised any
possession over, any part of these marginal lands, either
within or without three-mile limits, except under grants
from the States. On the other hand, each of the Gulf
States began to exercise acts of possession, ownership,
dominion and sovereignty over the marginal belt from
the time of admission into the Union, without regard to
any three-mile limit."8 The hearings of Congressional
Committees show and their reports assert that very large
sums of money have been spent by the States and their
public agencies and grantees in the development and
improvement of the marginal submerged lands adjacent
to the States' borders." Not only have the States' posses16See note 5, supra.

sion, dominion and sovereignty over these marginal belts
beer open and notorious, but that is coupled with the fact
that for much more than a century federal departments
and agencies not only acquiesced in but unequivocally recognized the States' rightful claims to these belts. 8 It is
conceded that in many instances the GoVernment itself
has deemed it necessary to acquire title from these States
before attempting to exercise any power of its own. 9
There is nothing to indicate that the claims or uses of
the marginal lands were ever limited to three miles. Certainly there is no evidence before us, and there was none
before the Congress, that up to 1937 the United States
had ever attempted to limit the sovereignty of the Gulf
States within bbundaries three miles from their coasts.
On the other hand, evidence considered by the Congressional Committees and argued to us provides ample support for holding that the Gulf States did not consider
their boundaries as limited to three miles.

The constitutions of all these States'defined their
boundaries when they were admitted into the Union.
The first Texas Constitution kept in. force the same

boundary, three leagues into the Gulf, claimed for the
Republic of Texas before it became a State."0 This definition was presented to Congress as a reason why Texas
should be granted three leagues. The constitutions of
all of the other States involved here defined their
coastal boundaries as extending from one Gulf point to
another "including all -islands" three or six leagues from
the shore or coastline. The legislative history of the
Submerged Lands Act shows that these definitions were
repeatedly called to the attention of Congress as a reason
why these Gulf States should be granted three leagues or
more.2 ' From the standpoint of the paper boundary
20 Texas Const , 1845, Art. XIII, ยง 3, continued in effect "All

laws . . . in force in the Republic of Texas," thus including the 1836
Boundary Act. Republic of Texas Boundary Act, December 19,
1836, 1 Laws of the Republic of Texas 133 (3 leagues).
21 These provisions are found in Ala. Const., 1819, preamble
(6 leagues); Miss. Const., 1817, preamble (6 leagues);. La. Const.,
1812, preamble (3 leagues).
From the beginning of the congressional hearings on the matter of
the submerged lands, it has been clear to Congress that all the Gulf
States' constitutional definitions of their boundaries have been a
basis of their claims, without regard to the slight differences in
language. These claims, reappeared throughout the hearings. For
illustration, an eight-page opinion of Dean Borchard of Yale
appeared as "Appendix B" to S. Rep. No. 1260, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.,
as early as 1946. He stated: "Examining the conduct of the States
we find a series of provisions in State constitutions and statutes in
which several States, e. g., Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi,
Texas, and Louisiana, lay claim to a maritime boundary of 3 leagues,
6 leagues, or more." Id., at 16.
During the 1953 hearings Senator Long of Louisiana was concerned
by statements made by Senator Holland of Florida, the author of the

claims, Texas urges, on the basis of the more precise definition of its seaward boundary, that it has a stronger case
than the other States. Although all these paper claims
were considered by Congress, none was treated as decisive
of the question of state boundaries, as is clearly shown by
Congress' refusal to make Texas and Florida22 the exclusive beneficiaries of this Act simply because their constitutions had specifically defined a three-league seaward
boundary. Nevertheless, each constitutional definition
provides some color of title for each State's- claim of a
boundary extending at least three leagues from its coastline. The paper claims of each State, therefore, merely
add some weight to the overwhelming fact, as Congress
saw it, that for more than 100 years all the Gulf States
exercised the only possession, dominion and sovereignty
over the submerged lands adjacent to their coastlines
that was ever exercised at all. The admitted facts with
reference to these state boundaries thus entitle all the
States to three-league marginal belts, if we fairly apply
the equitable principles of prescription under which
Congress declared this controversy between the Federal
Government and the Gulf States should be settled."

that the enabling act which was passed by Congress described the
boundaries of Louisiana as including all islands within 3 leagues of
the coast ......
To this Senator Holland replied, "The Senator from Florida has

Louisiana has mentioned. The Senator from Florida thinks that the
coast of Louisiana is that rim of islands, but the court might not so
find when. it went before the court." Hearings before the Senate

The result of the Court's holding in this and the
Florida case" is that Texas and Florida will have marginal belts that uniformly extend three leagues from their
shores. The other Gulf States, however, are not so fortunate. Their boundaries will extend only three miles
in some places. The Government concedes, however,
that their boundaries extend three miles beyond the coastline of their islands--which may be as far as six leagues
from the mainland. Thus, Louisiana, Mississippi and
Alabama will have irregular saw-toothed boundaries projecting six leagues at some points and retreating to within
three miles of the mainland at other points. This condition follows from the Government's concession that all
lands between the States' islands and the mainland are
lands beneath inland waters. The mere exercise of jurisdiction over such jagged boundaries as these raises serious
problems. Moreover, there is an element of fundamental
unfairness about granting Texas and Florida ownership
and sovereignty over three-league marginal belts while
denying it to their sister States bordering the Gulf of
Mexico. This is bound to frustrate the intent of Congress
to settle this whole Gulf States controversy at this time.
The unfairness of the Court's result is particularly
emphasized when we consider the plight iti which it leaves
Louisiana. One of the grounds that Congress assigned
for its desire to restore these lands to the States was its
strong belief that the States rather than the Federal Government should exploit their offshore oil. This desire
rested on two conclusions: (1) that the States would do
it better and more effectively for the interests of the
public at large,2" and (2) that it would be unconscionable

of the support of the State's public-school system. To
take these marginal lands away from the State of Louisiana and give Texas the lands it claims--when Texas

limit-seems to me completely incompatible with the
kind of justice and fairness that the Congress wanted
to bring about by this Act. Moreover, I am not at all
sure but that this result will completely upset the congressional desire to bring about once And for all a settlement of this long-standing controversy by passage of the
Submerged Lands Act. 9
Nothing in the Act itself indicates that Texas was to be
given any more consideration in this case than Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama. Had Congress wanted to give
the land to Texas and refuse to give it to the other States
it easily could have done so. In fact, this was specifically
suggested to Congress by the Attorney General of the
United States, and the Congress rejected it. ยฐ Time
and again Congress emphasized that its interests were
focused on the problem of these lands because of the
unfairness it saw in taking them from the Gulf States.
As Congress indicated, it is time that the problem be
solved, the title be quieted and the controversy be stilled."

In my judgment to interpret this Act in a way which
grants the land to Texas and Florida and withholds it from
the other Gulf States simply prolongs this costly and disquieting controversy. It will not be finally settled until
it is settled the way Congress believes is right, and I do
not think Congress will believe it right to award these
marginal lands to Texas and Florida and deny them to
the other Gulf States.

Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845 (9 Stat. 108)
pursuant to a prior Joint Resolution (5 Stat. 797) which
reserved for adjustment by the United States "all questions of boundary ,that may arise with other governments." Texas as early as 1836 had claimed, as the
opinion of the Court shows, a seaward boundary of "three
leagues from land." Such a claim conflicted with our
national policy in the Gulf, since the United States before then -had in treaties with Spain (8 Stat. 252) and
with Mexico (8 Stat. 372) described the boundaries
between the two countries west of the Mississippi as commencing "on the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the river
Sabine, in the sea." Moreover the Convention of 1838
to establish the boundary between the United States and
Texas (8 Stat. 511) agreed to the running and marking
of "that portion of the said boundary which extends from

the mouth of the Sabine, where that river enters the Gulph
of Mexico, to the Red River." Certainly in that Convention Texas was not going so far as to claim, as she had
earlier, "three leagues" into the Gulf.
I agree with the Court that there was nothing done at
or subsequent to that time to approve the Texas claim to
three leagues from land unless it be the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo signed on February 2, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, by
the United States and Mexico and which, inter alia, fixed
the "boundary line between the two republics" in the Gulf
of Mexico "three leagues from land, opposite the mouth
of the Rio Grande." Can we say that the United States
sat at that conference table negotiating for Texas and
her boundary claim? Was the seaward boundary once
claimed by Texas now claimed by the United States in
recognition that Texas owned it?
There is not a word in the history of the negotiations to
indicate that the United States had moral or legal claim
to the three-league belt because of the earlier claim of
Texas. There is no suggestion that the United States
claimed derivatively from the right of Texas and thus
upheld the position of Texas, approving the claim made
by Texas in 1836. There is not a word indicating that
the Treaty of 1848 was in form or in essence an undertaking by Congress to fix the boundaries of Texas under
the 1838 Convention.
The terms of the 1838 Convention do not support any
such construction for, as I have said, that Convention
fixed the boundary as extending "from the mouth of
the Sabine, where that river enters the Gulph of Mexico,"
not "three leagues" seaward of that point. To conclude,
therefore, that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was
intended to fix the land and sea boundaries of Texas
in accordance with the Texas Boundary Act of 1836
is to indulge in mental gymnastics beyond my capacities.

aries of Texas was not contained in the unilateral act
of Texas reflected in her 1836 statute but by the Convention of 1838 which required the seaward boundary
to extend from "the mouth of the Sabine, where that river
enters the Gulph of Mexico." The obligation in this
Convention thus is at war with any inference that the
seaward boundary was to be "three leagues" from shore.
Cf. United States v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1, 32.
While the 1838 Convention failed to include any seaward territory, a Joint Commission appointed to make the
survey pursuant to the 1838 Convention actually marked
the boundary between the United States and the Republic
of Texas at the mouth of the Sabine River-not three
leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.'
It is true that the Joint Resolution of 1845 (5 Stat. 797)
called for the formation of Texas "subject to the adjustment by this government of all questions of boundary that
may arise with other governments." But the situation
envisaged by that clause soon changed. The Mexican war
broke out in 1846; and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
finally brought it to a close. By the time the treaty negotiations started the United States was thinking in new
dimensions. The problem was no longer finding and
establishing what the Texas boundaries had been. We
then put that question to one side. The instructions to

the sole preoccupation was with the acquisition of land
from Mexico.'
"The commissioner of the United States was
authorized to agree to the establishment of the Rio
Grande as the boundary,- f"om its entrance into the
Gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary
of New Mexico, in north latitude about thirty-two
degrees, and to obtain a cession to the United States
of the provinces of New Mexico and the Californias,
and the privilege of the right of way across the
isthmus of Tehuantepec. The boundary of the Rio
Grande, and the cession to the United States of New
Mexico and Upper California, constituted an ultimatum which our commissioner was, under no
circumstances, to yield.
"That it might be manifest not only to Mexico,
but to all other nations, that the United States were
not disposed to take advantage of a feeble power, by
insisting upon wresting from her all the other provinces, including many of her principal towns and
cities, which we had conquered and held in our military occupation, but were willing to conclude a treaty
in a spirit of liberality, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the restoration to Mexico of all
our other conquests.
"As the territory to be acquired by the boundary
proposed might be estimated to be of greater value
than a fair equivalent for our just demands, our commissioner was authorized to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as
was deemed reasonable." (Italics added.)

of Texas. He stated, "The extensive and valuable territories ceded by Mexico to the United States constitute
indemnity for the past."' And he expounded on the
valued dditions of New Mexico and Upper California
to our domain.'0 There is no mention of any settlement of any claim of Texas to a seaward boundary "three
leagues" off shore. Nor is there any reference to any
boundary settlement based on old Texas clairs. This is
not surprising, for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was
part of our empire building, not the determination of old
boundaries.
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo has until now never
been considered to have played any part in determining
any Texan boundary question. As stated by the Court
in United States v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1, the boundary question was resolved by the Act of September 9, 1850 (9 Stat.
446). After quoting the 1836 Act by which Texas claimed
"three leagues -from land." as her seaward border, the
*Court went on to say:
"This boundary had not been defined when Texas
,was admitted as a State into the Union, with the
territory 'properly included within and rightfully
belonging to the Republicof Texas.' The settlement
of that question, together with certain claims made
by Texas against the United States, were among thes
Congr
subjects that engaged -the attention o'f
during the consideration of the various measures costituting the Compromises of 1850. The result wah
the passage of the above act of September 9, 1850,,

by the State of Texas. This legislation of the two
governments constituted a convention or contract in

respect of all matters embraced by it. The settlement of 1850 fixed the boundary of Texas 'on the
north' to commence at the point at which the 100th
meridian intersects the parallel of 36' 30' north latitude, and from that point the northern line ran due
west to the 103d meridian, thence due south to the
32d degree of north latitude, thence on that parallel
to the Rio Bravo del Norte, and thence with the
channel of that river to the gulf of Mexico." 162
U. S., at 39.
Drawing the line "to the Gulf of Mexico" is a far cry
from drawing it to a point "three leagues" from the shore.
What we do today is quite inconsistent with what a unanimous Court in United States v. Texas, supra, decided in
1896. What the Court said was not decided until 1850
we now say was decided earlier.
Though the United States and Mexico by the Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo established land boundaries between the two countries, Congress never recognized that
the Treaty established any boundaries of Texas. In her
1836 statute, Texas not only claimed the three-league belt
in the Gulf of Mexico but also much of the territory lying
west and north of her present boundaries, including
eastern New Mexico which, like the three:league belt, was
acquired under the Treaty by the United States. Congress in the 1850 compromise paid Texas $10,000,000 to
relinquish its claim to this territory. Yet this payment
was regarded by Congress not as purchase price but as
settlement of a disputed claim.' Accordingly, it was
early held that eastern New Mexico, though claimed by
Texas, was not brought into the Union by the Joint

Resolution of 1845 and that the Treaty of Guadalupe

Hidalgo did not establish what the Texas boundaries had
been at the time of its annexation. De Baca v. United
States, 36 Ct. Cl. 407 (1901). I cannot understand how

the Treaty can be said to have established a seaward
boundary when it did not fix the inland boundaries of

Texas.

The Court does not suggest that all the land

claimed by Texas in her 1836 statute and subsequently

ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe
.Hidalgo was "territory properly included within, and
rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas" within the
meaning of the Joint Resolution of 1845. Yet I can see
no basis for deciding that the Treaty, though not recognizing the validity of the western boundary claims of
Texas, did establish and fix other Texas boundaries."2 If
The Court suggests, ante, note 100, that while the United States
pressed Texas' claim to the three-league belt, Texas' claim to eastern
New Mexico "obviously was not pressed against Mexico on Texas'
behalf." Yet the evidence relied upon by the Court in finding that
the United States pressed the Texas claim to a three-league belt supports no such, distinction. The statement of President Polk to Congress (H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 60, 30th Cong., 1st Sess. 4, 7) said, "The
Congress of Texas, by its act of December 19, 1836, had declared the
Rio del Norte to be the boundary of that republic." The instructions to John Slidell (S. Exec. Doc. No. 52, 30th Cong., 1st Sess. 75)
read, "The Congress of Texas, by the act of December 19, 1836, have
declared the Rio del Norte, from itp mouth to its source, to be a
boundary of that republic." The Court relies on this evidence in
finding that the United States was confirming the claims in the Texas
act of 1836, insofar as it related to a seaward boundary but not insofar
as the act claimed ownership of all land lying east of the Rio Grande.
Since these communications expressly referred to the Texas claim to
the territory east of the Rio Grande, from its mouth to its source,
which included eastern New Mexico, whereas they were wholly silent
on any claim to a seaward territory, the Court's conclusion that the
seaward claim was pressed and approved while some territorial claims
were not, seems fanciful to me.
12

DOUGLAS,

the Government was not negotiating on behalf of Texas
in acquiring the eastern New Mexico territory; how can it
be said to have done so with respect to the seaward
boundary claim?
The southwestern boundary of Texas was confirmed in
the 1850 Compromise to lie along the Rio Grande "to the
Gulf of Mexico." The 1838 Convention had fixed the
eastern boundary at "the mouth of the Sabine." Thus,
on the two occasions when the United States and Texas
negotiated and agreed upon boundaries and when they
would have been most likely to have settled the question,
no extension of the Texas territory into the Gulf was
recognized. The conclusion for me is irresistable that
the seaward boundary, so Jaras Texas was concerned, was
so inconsequential as to require or receive no settlement.
I conclude that in terms of ยง 4 of the 1953 Act the boundary of Texas reserved for later adjudication when Texas
was admitted to the Union was on its seaward side never
approved by Congress to be three leagues from shore.
Why then the reference in the Treaty to the "Boundary
line" between the United States and Mexico as "three
leagues" from land in the Gulf of Mexico?
The Court says that the United States in negotiating
the Treaty attempted to follow the 1836 Texas Act. The
projet of the Treaty given to Trist did provide for a
boundary line commencing "three leagues from the land
opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande." 13 But neither
it nor the accompanying instructions made any reference
to the 1836 Act of Texas. Trist was not told to take the
1836 Act as his guide when it came to seaward boundaries.
I can find nothing in the instructions to Trist which
relates his duties in negotiating the Treaty to what Texas
had claimed in 1836, nor does the Court refer us to

any such instruction. To be sure, Trist's predecessor,
John Slidell, had been advised by the Secretary of State,
Mr. Buchanan, in a letter dated November 10, 1845, that
"The CQngress of Texas, by the act of December 19, 1836,
have declared the Rio del Norte [Rio Grande], from its
mouth to its source, to be a boundary of that republic." 14 Trist knew of these earlier instructions.1 5 Yet if
he followed them literally he would have negotiated a
boundary beginning "at the mouth" of the Rio Grande
not "three leagues from land opposite the mouth." 6
And, as I have pointed out, the purpose of Trist's mission
was much different from that of Slidell's. Slidell was sent
to Mexico before the war to settle a boundary dispute.
Trist went to obtain the fruits of our conquest of Mexico.
The Court concedes that Slidell's instructions demonstrate
"total insensitivity to any problem of a peaward boundary." I agree., But I cannot take the additional step
that, although our State Department was wholly insensitive to the problem of a seaward boundary, it was none'theless trying to stand in the shoes of Texas and get
Mexico to validate the old boundary claims of Texas. So
far as I can-deduce, this is sheer speculation.
Much less speculative is the reason advianced in 1875
by Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State.

question with regard to Spain's claim of jurisdiction of

two leagues from the Spanish coast." Hamilton Fish
replied on January 22, 1875, as follows:,"
"... I have the honor to inform you that this
Government has uniformly, under every administration which has had occasion to consider the subject,
objected to the pretension of Spain adverted to, upon
the same ground and in similar terms to those contained in the instruction of the Earl of Derby.
"We have always understood and asserted that,
pursuant to public law, no nation can rightfully claim
jurisdiction atsea beyond a marine league from its
coast.
"This opinion on our part has sometimes been said
to be inconsistent with the facts that, -by the laws of
the United States, revenue-cutters are authorized to
board vessels anywhere within four leagues of their
coasts, and that by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
so called, between the United States and Mexico, of
the second of February, 1848, the boundary line
between the dominions of the parties begins in the
Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land.
"It is believed, however, that in carrying into effect
the authority conferred by the act of Congress
referred to, no vessel is boarded, if boarded at all,
except such a one as, upon being hailed, may have
answered that she was bound to a port of the United
States. At all events, although the act of Congress
was passed in the infancy of this Government, there
is no known instance of any complaint on the part
of a foreign government of the trespass by a commander of a revenue-cutter upon the rights of its flag

"In respect to the provision in the treaty with

suggested by the passage in the act of Congress

of preventing smuggling. By turning to the files of
your legation, you will find that Mr. Bankhead, in a

the provision in question. Mr. Buchanan, however,

its "three league" provision. They. show a practice of
exercising extraterritorial regulation beyond the usual
three-mile limit, with respect to customs and smuggling.
It is true that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo speaks in
terms of "boundary." But, if it meant "boundary" in
the technical property sense, it would mark a line that
separated the territory of the United States and Mexico
and established a territorial claim good against all comers.
Our State Department from the beginning insisted that
was not intended. When Great Britain protested in 1848
that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo did not respect the
three-mile limit which "is acknowledged by international
law and practice as the extent of territorial jurisdiction
over the sea that washes the coasts of states," Secretary
of State Buchanan's answer (which, as we have noted,
Hamilton Fish referred to in his communication of January 22, 1875.) was as follows: I
"In answer I have to state, that the stipulation in
the treaty can only affect the rights of Mexico and
the United States. If for their mutual convenience
it has been deemed proper to enter into such an
arrangement, third parties can have no just cause of
respect to other questions of international maritime law, this extension of territorial seas shall not be applied by one of the contracting
parties to the vessels of the other, unless that party shall apply it
equally to vessels of other nations with which she has concluded
treaties of commerce and navigation.". Id., at 171-172.

complaint. The Government of the United States
never intended by this stipulation to question the
rights which Great Britain or any other power may
possess under the law of nations."
That has consistently been our construction. I have
already referred to what Secretary Fish said in 1875.
When Mexico in 1935 undertook to extend the breadth of
Mexican territorial waters from three to nine miles,29 our
Ambassador Josephus Daniels on instructions from the
State Department protested, reserving "all rights of whatever nature so far as concerns any effects upon American
commerce from enforcement of this legislation." ". And
when Mexico in reply 8'referred to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as justifying her claim to nine miles, the
State Department reiterated among other things our consistent position that the treaty provision extending the
"boundary" into the Gulf for three leagues was included
to give,the two nations jurisdiction to that distance at
that particular point "to prevent smuggling." 2
It seems apparent from this history that the United
States in negotiating the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
was far from determining that the metes and bounds of
our property on the seaward side of the Gulf ran to three
leagues. The three-league provision in purpose and presumed effect had quite a different aim. It had no aim
to assert derivatively a title that Texas had claimed. 'Its
aim was merely to mark a zone where, so far as the two
contracting parties were concerned, our law enforcement
agencies 6ould maintain effective patrols. If this history
shows nothing else, it shows that the United States had
a national interest in having the three-league belt recog29

nized for its own purposes, whereas Texas up to the time
oil was discovered offshore placed no value whatsoever on
a seaward boundary. For me the argument becomes too
thin to say that the United States, though nominally
negotiating on her own behalf, was claiming the three.league maritime belt on behalf of Texas.
If we acted today with the precision and meticulous
care which is demanded in title disputes, we could not, I
think, say that the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo recognized or approved the Texas claim that
the territory of Texas extended three leagues from shore.
Yet if we are to decide these cases by substandards
(lessening the requirements of proof as we should do if
Congress intended to grant whatever the parties fairly

claimed), then I agree with

MR. JUSTICE BLACK

that the

-discrimination in favor of Texas and against Louisiana,
Alabama, and-Mississippi is quite unjustified.
If the southeast corner of Texas was three leagues offshore, it is difficult for me to see how the southwest corner
of Louisiana was not at the same point. From the beginning the United States and Spain fixed their corner west
of the Mississippi "on the Gulph of Mexico, at the mouth
of the river Sabine, in the sea." 8 Stat. 254. If we move
the Texas boundary out three leagues, it is hard to see
why Louisiana's does not accompany it. It has long been
recognized that a part of Louisiana's border is "a water
boundary" that extends "to the open sea or Gulf of Mexico," Louisianav. Mississippi,202 U. S. 1, 43, and includes
"the deep water sailing channel line as a boundary."

The enabling Act authorizing the people of the Territory of Orleans to form Louisiana described the territory
as running "to the gulf of Mexico; thence bounded by the
said gulf . . , including all islands within three leagues
of the coast." 2 Stat. 641. The boundaries described

in the Act admitting Louisiana to the Union are similarly
described as "Jo the gulf of Mexico . . . thence bounded
by the said gulf . . . including all islands within three

leagues of the coast." 2 Stat. 701, 702.
As respects Mississippi, Congress in the Enabling Act
(3 Stat. 348) provided that the territory included in the
new State would run from a specified point on the Gulf of
Mexico, "westwardly, including all the islands within six
leagues of the shore." This was the boundary description
used since George III of Great Britain described West
Florida as "bounded to the southward by the Gulf of
Mexico, including all islands within six leagues of the
coast."
Alabama -when a territory had two of its boundaries
described as "thence due south. to the Gulf of Mexico,
thence eastwardly, including all the islands within six
leagues of. the shore, to the Perdido river." 3 Stat. 371.
This language was repeated in the Enabling Act. 3 Stat.
489.
The United States concedes that, so far as Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama are concerned, all the submerged
lands between the mainland and the islands are sufficiently
enclosed to constitute, inland waters that passed to the
State on its entry into the Union. Pollard v. Hagan, 3
How. 212. It further concedes that these States have
rights to the submerged lands within three miles-of the
islands under the ordinary three-mile rule.
If we were to require the degree of proof of ownership
which is ordinarily required in title disputes, I would agree
that neither Louisiana, Alabama, nor Mississippi has met
the burden of proof. But if standards and requirements

as lax as those used to grant Texas three leagues from
shore are sufficient for her, they should be sufficient for
these othe'r three States.
The heart of the Texan claim is that the United States
and Mexico recognized that there was a three-league
maritime belt which each would respect and that this
was done in recognition of the validity of the claims contained in the 1836 statute of Texas. This belt was called
a "boundary"; but, as I have tried to demonstrate, it was
not a territorial claim but only a demarcation of zones
where the parties' respective law enforcement activities
would be recognized and approved. The Gulf presents
peculiar problems due to its shallow coast. The shallowness of its waters is well documented and our Government was well aware of this condition in 1848." These
are the persuasive facts behind the creation of the threeleague belt by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and by
Mexico in the other treaties concerning the Gulf which
she negotiated with other nations.
If the policy of measuring the zone of the United States
as "three leagues" into the Gulf off the shore of Texas is
to give Texas property rights to the submerged lands in
that zone, the beneficiaries of that concern should be all
our Gulf 8tates. At best the language used to describe
the seaward territories of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi is ambiguous. The words "to the Gulf of Mexico . . . including all of the islands" within certain desig-

nated leagues of the shore can reasonably mean that the
"boundary line" is marked by the islands. There is difficulty in that construction. Yet it is for me no more
difficult than the method we use to give Texas a territorial
claim in the same belt. All the States on the Gulf

should be given the same benefit of the doubts that have
been resolved in favor of Texas. The claim of Florida, as
shown in United States v. Florida, decided this day,
post, p. 121, is fully established by the standard I would
ask Texas to meet. If we are to relax the standard of
proof for the benefit of Texas, we should do so for all these
claimants. In that posture, the claims of each of the
other Gulf States which have gone "long-unchallenged,"
as shown by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, are as clear as those of
Texas.
