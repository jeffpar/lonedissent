MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

with whom MR.

JUSTICE FORTAS

concurs, dissenting.
This case arose out of an assembly in Duffy Square,
New York City, protesting American policy in Vietnam.
After a few minutes of speeches, the police dispersed the
crowd, utilizing two policemen on horseback and a dozen
patrolmen.
The complaint charged disorderly conduct,
"in that with intent to provoke a breach of the peace
and under circumstances whereby a breach of the
peace might be occasioned, the defendants did unlawfully congregate and assemble at the above location
obstructing the area to the exclusion of those wishing
to use same, and did delay vehicular traffic while
carrying placards and using loud and boisterous language; by their actions did cause a crowd to collect;
[w]hen ordered to move on the defendants did fail to
do so, after being informed that their actions were
not lawful."

OCTOBER TERM, 1966.
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting.

386 U. S.

The evidence showed that the meeting was peaceful
and orderly until the horses arrived. Up to that time
the crowd was apparently small with no one paying much
attention. The bulk of the evidence at the trial related
to acts of individual petitioners during the period when
the police were trying to disperse the crowd, that is,
between the advent of the horses and the arrests. After
the appearance by the police, there was a minor disturbance, one person hitting a horse with a rolled-up cardboard placard, one biting a policeman, and one lying
down. But these acts were not charged in the complaint.
While no opinion was written by the trial court, the
Appellate Term did write and in its opinion relied heavily on these post-dispersion facts to justify the convictions. 48 Misc. 2d 611, 613-618, 619, 265 N. Y. S. 2d
841, 843-847, 849. But as stated by Judge Hofstadter
in dissent:
"The occurrences now offered as a basis for upholding the convictions were not the subject of the complaint charged. And the events, including any
alleged disturbance by any defendant, ensuing upon
the order, were the direct and immediate issue of a
misconception by the police of the lawful warrant
and scope of their authority." 48 Misc. 2d, at 630,
265 N. Y. S. 2d, at 860.
A conviction on one ground may not be sustained on
grounds that might have been charged but were not.
"It is as much a violation of due process to send an
accused to prison following conviction of a charge on
which he was never tried as it would be to convict him
upon a charge that was never made." Cole v. Arkansas,
333 U. S. 196, 201. And see Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87; Ashton v. Kentucky, 384 U. S. 195.

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting.

Likewise a conviction "upon a charge not made" is not
consistent with due process. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299
U. S. 353, 362.
Where First Amendment rights are involved, as they
were here, we have been meticulous to insist upon cleancut violations of ordinances protecting law and order, lest
broad or fuzzy applications be used to suffocate or impair
the exercise of those constitutional rights. Stromberg v.
California,283 U. S. 359, 369; Edwards v. South Carolina,
372 U. S. 229, 237; Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 551552;. Ashton v. Kentucky, supra, at 200-201.
Issues of that character and gravity are tendered here
and I would resolve them.
