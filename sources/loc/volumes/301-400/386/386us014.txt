PER CURIAM.

The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are

Texas, 385 U. S. 554, and the case is remanded to that
court for consideration of the unresolved issues.
. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

dissents from the reversal of the
Court of Appeals in United States v. Rundle, 349 F. 2d
416, which affirmed United States v. Rundle, 243 F.
Supp. 695, 700, where the District Court granted the
petition for habeas corpus since the introduction of the
accused's "prior criminal record for obstructing a railroad
was so fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process
of law."
