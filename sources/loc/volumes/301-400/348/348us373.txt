SAPIR v. UNITED STATES.

SAPIR v. UNITED STATES.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 534. Decided March 7, 1955.
Finding that the judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing the
judgment of conviction in this case and instructing the trial court
to dismiss the indictment was correct, this Court reinstates that
judgment and vacates a subsequent judgment directing a new
trial.
216 F. 2d 722, judgment vacated.

Sam Dazzo for petitioner.
Solicitor General Sobeloff, Assistant Attorney General
Olney, Beatrice Rosenberg and Joseph A. Barry for the
United States.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is granted.
We believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
of October 20, 1954, reversing and remanding this cause
with instructions to dismiss the indictment was correct.
It is not necessary for us to pass on the question presented
under its subsequent judgment of November 17, 1954,
directing a new trial. We vacate the latter judgment,
which directed the new trial, and we reinstate the former
one which instructed the trial court to dismiss the
indictment.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.

Petitioner was convicted by the jury of a conspiracy
to defraud the United States. Petitioner moved for a
judgment of acquittal. The District Court denied the
motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that
that motion should have been granted, as the evidence

348 U. S.

was insufficient to covvict. 216 F. 2d 722. It accordingly reversed and remanded the cause with instructions
to dismiss the indictment. Later, the Government moved
to amend the judgment so as to grant a new trial on the
ground of newly discovered evidence. The Court of
Appeals granted the motion of the Government.
The granting of a new trial after a judgment of acquittal for lack of evidence violates the command of the
Fifth Amendment that no person shall "be subject for
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life
or limb."
The correct rule was stated in Kepner v. United States,
195 U. S. 100, at 130, "It is, then, the settled law of this
court that former jeopardy includes one who has been
acquitted by a verdict duly rendered . . . ." If the jury
had acquitted, there plainly would be double jeopardy to
give the Government another go at this citizen. If, as in
the Kepner case, the trial judge had rendered a verdict
of acquittal, the guarantee against double jeopardy would
prevent a new trial of the old offense. I see no difference
when the appellate court orders a judgment of acquittal
for lack of evidence.
If petitioner had asked for a new trial, different considerations would come into play, for then the defendant
opens the whole record for such disposition as might be
just. See Bryan v. United States, 338 U. S. 552. And
see Trono v. United States, 199 U. S. 521; Stroud v.
United States, 251 U. S. 15, 18; Francis v. Resweber, 329
U. S. 459, 462. Moreover, a reversal by the appellate
court on grounds of error that infected the trial would
also be different, as Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319,
shows. But an acquittal on the basis of lack of evidence
concludes the controversy, as the Kepner case holds, and
puts it at rest under the protection of the Double Jeopardy
Clause, absent a motion by the defendant for a new trial.
