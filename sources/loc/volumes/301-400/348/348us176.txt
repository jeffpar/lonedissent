delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question in this case is whether an appeal may be
taken to a court of appeals from a district court order
refusing to stay an action for an accounting pending
arbitration.
This equitable action was brought in a state court for
an accounting of the profits of a joint venture in construction under the National Housing Act, and was removed
to a federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. Under the joint venture agreement, Baltimore

Opinion of the Court.

Contractors agreed to pay the respondent twenty-five percent of the net profits on its construction contracts. The
provision under which arbitration was sought reads as
follows:
"In the event of any dispute in the calculation of the
net profits under this Paragraph, Frenkil shall select
either Wooden and Benson or Haskins and Sells or
an accountant or auditor named by either of them
whose determination of all such disputes shall be
final and binding upon all parties to the dispute."
The complaint alleged a number of improper practices
on the part of Contractors: the use of "dummy" corporations to inflate costs; charges for machinery and material purchases without credits for value or surpluses
after completion of the job; receipt of undisclosed
rebates; excessive charges and rental for equipment;
padded insurance costs, etc.
The petitioner moved for a stay of the action pursuant
to § 3 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 3,
which authorizes a stay by a federal court when an issue
is "referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing
for such arbitration." The District Court refused the
stay on the ground that the agreement between the
parties did not constitute an agreement to arbitrate. The
court apparently construed the quoted provision as limited to mathematical disputes. Petitioner appealed to
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On respondent's motion the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal,
citing Morgantown v. Royal Ins. Co., 337 U. S. 254. Certiorari was sought on the following question:
"Whether in an action for an accounting an interlocutory order denying a stay under Section 3 of the
United States Arbitration Act should be regarded as
a denial of an injunction from which an appeal lies."

In view of the conflict between the decision below and
Hudson .Lumber Co. v. United States Plywood Corp., 181
F. 2d 929, we granted the petition, 347 U. S. 942.'
Congress has. long expressed a policy against piecemeal
appeals. The reasons for such a policy were stated as
follows:
"From the very foundation of our judicial system
the object and policy of the acts of Congress in relation to appeals and writs of error, (with the single
exception of a provision in the act of 1875 in relation
to cases of removal, which was repealed by the act
of 1887,) have been to save the expense and delays
of repeated appeals in the same suit, and to have the
whole case and every matter in controversy in it
decided in a single appeal." McLish v. Roff, 141
U. S. 661, 665-666.'

Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 84, provided that appeals in civil actions could be taken to the
circuit courts only from final decrees and judgments.'
That requirement of finality has remained a part of our
1The Hudson Lumber Co. case was a suit for a declaratory judgment as to the meaning of certain contract provisions with a prayer for
incidental injunctive relief. Appeal was allowed by -the Court of
Appeals from the District Court order staying the trial pending resort
to.arbitration as required by the contract.

allowed in equity, although not at common law. 1 Holdsworth's

law ever since, and now appears as § 1291 of the Judicial
Code.'
The trial court's interpretation of the quoted contract clause and its order denying a stay could not be
called a -final decision under § 1291. It was as surely
an interlocutory order as the District Court's order in
Shanferoke Corp. v. Westchester Corp., 293 U. S. 449, 451.
428 U.S. C. § 1291:

"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all
final decisions of the district courts of the United States, the District
Court for the Territory of Alaska, the United States District Court
for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and
the District Court of the Virgin Islands, except where a direct review
may be had in the Supreme Court."
The statutory limitation of appeals to final decisions, i. e., judgments and decrees, Ex parte Tiffany, 252 U. S.32, 36, has called for
determinations of the characteristics of finality. Stack v. Boyle, 342
U. S.1, 6; Roberts v. U. S. District Court, 339 U. S.844, 845; Swift
& Co. v. Compania Caribe, 339 U. S.684, 688; Cohen v. Beneficial
Loan Corp., 337 U. S.541, 546; Cogen v. United States, 278 U. S. 221.
Cf. Bandini Co. v. Superior Court, 284 U. S.8, 14-15; Radio Station
WOW v. Johnson,326 U. S.120, 124; Montgomery Union v. Ledbetter
Co., 344 U. S.178. See Underwood, Appeals in the Federal Practice
from Collateral Orders, 36 Va. L. Rev. 731.
The concept of finality does not require a judgment completely
disposing of every matter or issue that arises in the litigation. Some
collateral issues may become "so severed . . .as to permit an appeal."

Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S.323, 328.
Shanferoke Corp. v. Westchester Corp., 293 U. S.449, was a suit
at common law to recover damages for breach of a contract containing
an arbitration clause. A motion was made to stay the suit until arbitration. The motion was denied because the trial court thought the
arbitration clause applicable only to New York litigation. This
Court held that the order was interlocutory and was appealable under
§ 129 of the Judicial Code of 1911, the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.
§ 1292 (1). The ruling followed Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co.,
infra, p. 182.

The question here piesented involves the interpretation
of 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (1) which makes an exception to the
requirement of finality, permitting appeals from "interlocutory orders . . . granting, continuing, modifying,
refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve
or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may
be had in the Supreme Court." Appealability here turns
on whether the District Court's refusal to stay this trial
for arbitration was the refusal of an "injunction" under
§ 1292.
The provision for interlocutory appeals was first introduced in 1891 when the circuit courts of appeals were
established as intermediate appellate courts. 26 Stat.
826. Section 7 of that Act allowed appeals from interlocutory orders in ,equity "granting or continuing" injunctions, but from those only. Additions to the class of
appealable interlocutory orders were made from time to
time until the enactment of § 1292 in its present form.'
appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1292 to the Court of Appeals from a
District Court interlocutory order refusing a stay sought pursuant to
the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 3. The Shanferoke
case was cited.
6 In 1895, § 7 was amended to permit an appeal from interlocutory
orders refusing or dissolving injuntions, or refusing to dissolve an
injunction. 28 Stat. 666. A further amendment was made in 1900
to include certain orders in receiverships. 31 Stat. 660. This amendment had the effect of repealing the 1895 provision which was restored in § 129 of the Judicial Code of 1911. 36 Stat. 1087, 1134.
See Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court,
124-127. The amendment of 1925, 43 Stat. 937, made two changes:
First, it embraced orders modifying or refusing to modify injunctions
and expanded the number of orders in receiverships which were appealable. Second, it dropped the words "in equity" from the phrase
"where upon a hearing in equity in a district court" which had been
employed since the initial enactment of § 7 in 1891. No change was
intended by that omission. Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line, 294
U. S. 454, 457, n. 3. In 1927, provision was made for interlocutory
appeals in patent cases which are final save for an accounting, 44

Opinion of the Court.

No discussion of the underlying reasons for modifying the
rule of finality appears in the legislative history, although
the changes seem plainly to spring from a developing need
to permit litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory
orders of serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.'
When the pressure rises to a point that influences Congress, legislative remedies are enacted. The Congress is in
a position to weigh the competing interests of the dockets
of the trial and appellate courts, to consider the practicability of savings in time and expense, and to give proper
weight to the effect on litigants. When countervailing
considerations arise, interested parties and organizations
become active in efforts to modify the appellate jurisdiction.8 This Court, however, is not authorized to approve
or declare judicial modification. It is the responsibility
of all courts to see that no unauthorized extension or reduction of jurisdiction, direct or indirect, occurs in the federal system. Shanferoke Corp. v. Westchester Corp., 293
U. S. 449, 451. Any such ad hoc decisions disorganize
practice by encouraging attempts to secure or oppose
appeals with a consequent waste of time and money. The
Stat. 1261. Interlocutory appeals in bankruptcy cases are covered
by § 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 47.
Compare Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 54 (b), and see Dickinson v.
Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507.
7 Statutory provisions for interlocutory appeals have been enacted
in Great Britain. See the Judicature Act of 1925, Law Reports
1925 (2), 15 & 16 Geo. V, c. 49, § 31; 19 Halsbury's Laws of England
(2d ed.) 209.

of the Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Judicial Conference
of the United States for Sept. 24-25, 1953, p. 27, Report of Committee on Enlargement of Scope of Appeals from Interlocutory Orders,

choices fall in the legislative domain. They are enlargement of the allowable list of appealable interlocutory
orders; abandonment of fragmentary appeals; or a general allowance of such appeals in the discretion of the
trial judge upon findings of need, with or without the
consent or approval of the appellate court.
A series of decisions of this Court has developed the
rationale for determining the appealability of such an
interlocutory order as this under § 1292 and its predecessors. The appealability of routine interlocutory
injunctive orders raised few questions. See George v.
Victor Co., 293 U. S. 377. There the statute was
clear. It was when stays of proceedings, in distinction
to injunctions, were appealed that the issue of jurisdiction became sharp. In Enelow v. New York Life Ins.
Co., 293 U. S. 379, a case arising when federal courts had
actions at law and proceedings in equity, a complaint at
common law on a life insurance policy was met by an
answer alleging fraud in the policy's procurement with a
prayer for its cancellation and a motion to try the
equitable issue first. The motion was granted, and jurisdiction on appeal from that order was approved on this
reasoning:
"TWe power to stay proceedings in another court appertains distinctively to equity in the enforcement of
equitable principles, and the grant or refusal of such
a stay by a court of equity of proceedings at law is
a grant or refusal of an injunction within the meaning of § 129 [§ 1292]. And, in this aspect, it makes
no difference that the two cases, the suit in equity
for an injunction and the action at law in which
proceedings are stayed, are both pending in the same
court, in view of the established distinction between
'proceedings at law and proceedings in equity in the

national courts and between the powers of those
courts when sitting as courts of law and when sitting
as courts of equity.' Per Van Devanter, J., in Griesa
v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 165 Fed. 48, 50, 51." 293
U. S., at 382.'
After the adoption of the one form of action by the
Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 2, we reiterated this ruling in a
like case. Ettelson v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., 317 U. S.
188. We said a stay of the complaint until disposition
of the fraud issue "is as effective . . . as an injunction . . . . The statute looks to the substantial effect of
the order made."
The point was made in the Enelow case that power to
stay mere steps within the framework of the litigation
before a court differs as to appealability from an injunction prohibiting proceedings in another court. This distinction was applied in Morgantown v. Royal Ins. Co., 337
U. S.254. There the insurance company brought a suit
for reformation of the contract. The insured counterclaimed, seeking to enforce the contract as written, and
demanded a jury trial; the company moved to strike the
demand; the court granted the motion and set the case
for trial to the court without a jury. The insured
appealed and the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.
We affirmed, holding that the Enelow rule did not apply;
that since this was an equitable proceeding with a counterclaim to enforce the policy, the decision to hear the reformation issue first without a jury was only a decision as
to how to try the case, and therefore was not an interlocutory order in the nature of an injunction. To. the
argument that the importance of a jury trial justified
9 Cf. Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line, 294 U. S. 454, 457, where
a stay in admiralty for arbitration was held not appealable as an
injunction but only an order as to the course of trial.

treating the order of trial as an interlocutory injunction,
we answered:
"Many interlocutory orders are equally important,
and may determine the outcome of the litigation,
but they are not for that reason converted into
injunctions." 337 U. S., at 258.
The Morgantown case controls here. 10 Whether the
District Court was right or wrong in its ruling that the
contract provision did not require arbitration proceedings,
it was simply a ruling in the only suit pending, actual or
fictional. It was a mere order and not an injunction as
that word is understood through the Enelow and the
Ettelson cases as a stay through equitable principles of a
common-law action. This present case is to be distinguished from the Shanferoke case, supra, note 5, in the
same way. There in a common-law action a motion for
an interlocutory injunction on an equitable defense was
refused. The order was appealable under Judicial Code
§ 129. This Court said:
"For the reasons stated in Enelow v. New York Life
Ins. Co., decided this day, ante, p. 379, an order
granting or denying a stay based on an equitable
defense or cross-bill interposed in an action at law
under § 274b, is appealable under § 129." 293 U. S.,
at 452.
The reliance on. the analogy of equity power to enjoin
proceedings in other courts has elements of fiction in this
day of one form of action The incongruity of taking
jurisdiction from a stay in a law type and denying jurisdiction in an equity type proceeding springs from the
persistence of outmoded procedural differentiations.
Some simplification would follow from an assumption or
denial of jurisdiction in both. . The distinction has been

applied for years, however, and we conclude that it is
better judicial practice to follow the precedents which
limit appealability of interlocutory orders, leaving Congress to make such amendments as it may find proper.
It is difficult to generalize as to whether interlocutory
appeals are or are not advantageous to an efficient administration of justice. A compromise has been worked out
by Congress through § 1292. But that compromise does
not authorize appeals to simplify litigation. This ruling
was a step in controlling the litigation before the trial
court, not the refusal of an interlocutory injunction.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK,

with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

concurs, dissenting.
I think the District Court's order denying a stay is
appealable because it is (1) "final" within the meaning
of 28 U. S. C. § 1291 and (2) a refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction within the meaning of § 1292. As
the Court admits, a collateral issue may be so severable
and unrelated to central trial issues that a judgment on
the collateral issue is considered "final" and appealable
under § 1291, even though other important issues are left
undecided. Given this common sense meaning § 1291
authorizes the present appeal. For certainly decision of
whetbr a judicial rather than an arbitration tribunal
shall hear and determine this accounting controversy is
logically and practically severable from the factual and
legal issues crucial to determination of the merits of the
controversy. And this Court has held that § 1292 makes
all stay orders appealable that have the substantial effect
of interlocutory injunction orders. Ettelson v. Metropoli318107 0 - 55 - 18

tan Ins. Co., 317 U. S. 188. The refusal to stay here had
that effect. Indeed, the Court seems to admit that this
order refusing a stay would be appealable had it been
entered by another judge not presiding in this particular
case. I agree with the Court that this jurisdictional "incongruity . . . springs from the persistence of outmoded
procedural differentiations" that have "elements of fiction" in this modern day. I do not agree that the Court's
obeisance to these incongruous fictions is required by
congressional enactments.
The Court relies on a purpose of Congress to avoid a
waste of time and money incident to repeated "piecemeal"
appeals in the same suit. But, as pointed out, Congress,
in §§ 1291 and 1292, has left the way open for the appeal
of many judgments finally deciding collateral and severable issues separately adjudicated in a case. Any rigid
rule to the contrary would itself guarantee useless delays
and expenses. For two trials, one unnecessary, may take
longer and cost more than two appeals where one would
do. Take this case for example. It must now go back
for a court accounting trial which could be time-consuming and expensive to litigants and to the Government.
And should petitioner lose on the merits it could undoubtedly appeal. On that review the first question for the
appellate court would be whether the order denying arbitration, which the Court now refuses to consider,. was
right or wrong. If found wrong, the trial court's judgment on the merits would have to be vacated and the case
again sent back for determination on the merits-this
time by arbitration. In that event the trial the Court
now orders will have been wholly futile-not even the
litigant who now appears to be successful will have gained
anything from it, unless perchance he stands to profit
from delay. There is some difficulty, at least, in laying
this wasteful procedure at the door of Congress.
