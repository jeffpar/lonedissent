Argued October 19-20, 1954.-Decided January 10, 1955.

In determining a net estate for federal estate tax purposes, a deduction may not be made under § 812 (d) of the Internal Revenue
Code on account of a charitable bequest that is to take effect
only if decedent's childless 27-year-old daughter dies without
descendants surviving her and her mother. Humes v. United
States, 276 U. S. 487. Pp. 187-200.

only if decedent's childless 27-year-old daughter dies without descendants surviving her and her mother. For the
reasons hereafter stated, we hold that it may not.
Louis Sternberger died testate June 25, 1947. His
federal estate tax return discloses a gross estate of
$2,406,541.71 and, for the additional estate tax, a net
estate of $2,064,346.55. It includes assets owned by him
at his death and others held by the Chase National Bank,
respondent herein, under a revocable trust created by him.
As the revocable trust makes provisions for charity that
are, for our purposes, identical with those in the will, this
opinion applies to both dispositions.
The will places the residuary estate in trust during the
joint lives of decedent's wife and daughter and for the
life of the survivor of them. Upon the death of such
survivor, the principal of the trust fund is payable to the
then living descendants of the daughter. However, if
there are no such descendants, one-half of the residue goes
to certain collateral relatives of decedent and the other
half to certain charitable corporations. If none of the
designated relatives are living, the entire residue goes to
the charitable corporations.1
At decedent's death, his wife and daughter survived
him. His wife was then 62 and his daughter 27. The
latter married in 1942, was divorced in 1944, had not
remarried and had not had a child.
In the estate tax return, decedent's executor, respondent herein, deducted $179,154.19 from the gross estate as
the present value of the conditional bequest to charity
of one-half of the residue. Respondent claimed no deduction for the more remote charitable bequest of the other
half of the residue. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction and determined a tax

deficiency on that ground. The Tax Court reversed the
Commissioner. 18 T. C. 836. The Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit affirmed the Tax Court, 207 F. 2d 600,
on the authority of Meierhof v. Higgins, 129 F. 2d 1002.
To resolve the resulting conflict with the Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in Newton Trust Co. v. Commissioner,
160 F. 2d 175, we granted certiorari, 347 U. S. 932.
The controlling provisions of the Revenue Code are in
substantially the same terms as when they were first
enacted in 1919 2 and are as follows:
"SEC. 812. NET ESTATE.
"For the purpose of the tax the value of the net
estate shall be determined . . . by deducting from
the value of the gross estate-"(d) TRANSFERS FOR PUBLIC, CHARITABLE, AND
RELIGIOUS UsEs.-The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers . . . to or for the use of any
corporation organized and operated exclusively for
religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes .

. . ."

I. R. C.

The Commissioner concedes that the corporations
named in the will qualify as charitable corporations under
the statute. There is rio doubt, therefore, that if the
bequest to them had been immediate and unconditional,
its value would be deductible. The question before us is
what, if any, charitable deduction may be made despite
(1) the deferment of the effective date of the charitable
bequest until the deaths of both decedent's wife and
daughter and (2) the conditioning of the bequest upon
a lack of descendants of decedent's daughter surviv2

ing at that time. We find the answer in the Treasury
Regulations, which are of long standing and strengthened by reenactments of I. R. C., § 812 (d), since their
promulgation.3
1. Section 81.44 of Treasury Regulations 105 would permit the deduction of the present value of the bequest
if it were an outright bequest, merely deferred until
the deaths of decedent's wife and daughter.
In their earliest form, the predecessors of these regulations, in 1919, recognized, in plain language, the propriety
of the deduction of the present value of a deferred, but
assured, bequest to charity.' Section 81.44 (d) of Treasury Regulations 105 does so with inescapable specificity:
"§ 81.44 Transfers for public, charitable, religious,
etc., uses...

"(d) If a trust is created for both a charitable and
a private purpose, deduction may be taken of the
'Its latest reenactment is in § 2055 (a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, 68A Stat. 390. The purpose of the deduction is to
encourage gifts to the named uses. Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U. S.
61, 63; 13 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 198, 201; 28 Va. L. Rev. 387-388. Like
other tax deductions, however, it must rest on more than a doubt or
ambiguity. See United States v. Stewart, 311 U. S.60, 71, and also
Commissioner v. Jacobson,336 U. S.28, 49.
Section 408 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 949, added to
I. R. C., § 812 (d), the so-called "disclaimer provision," whereby,
under certain conditions, the renunciation of a private bequest which
effectuates a gift to charity earns a charitable deduction from the
decedent's gross estate.
4 "ART. 53. Public, charitable, and similar bequests.-... It does
not prevent deduction . . .that the property placed in trust is also
subject to another trust for a private purpose. Thus, where money

value of the beneficial interest in favor of the former
only insofar as such interest is presently ascertainable, and hence severable from the interest in favor
of the private use. § 81.10 indicates the principles
to be applied in the computation of the present worth
of deferred uses, but such computation will not be
made by the Commissioner on behalf of the executor.
Thus, if money or property is placed in trust to pay
the income to an individual during his life, or for a
term of years, and then to pay or deliver the principal
to the charitable corporation,or to apply it to a charitable purpose, the present value of the remainderis
deductible. To determine the present value of such
remainder, use the appropriate factor in column 3
of Table A or B of §81.10. If the present worth of
a remainder bequeathed for a charitable use is dependent upon the termination of more than one life,
or in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table
A or B of § 81.10, the claim for the deduction must
be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the
computation of the present worth made, in accordance with the principle set forth in § 81.10, by
one skilled in actuarial computations." (Emphasis

worth" of assured bequests such as are the subject of each

bequest or devise forms the basis for a deduction. The amount of
the deduction, in such case, is the value, at the date of the decedent's
death, of the remainder interest in the money or property which
is devised or bequeathed to charity. For the manner of determining
the value of such remaindar interest, see Article 20." 21 T. D. 783784.
Article 20 prescribed methods of determining the present worth of
a remainder subject to a singlelife interest.

The statute restricts charitable deductions to bequests
to corporations "organized and operated exclusively for
... charitable . . . purposes."

(Emphasis supplied.)

Likewise, the above' section of the regulations requires
that the deductible value of "the beneficial interest in
favor of" the designated charitable purpose be "severable
from the interest in favor of the private use." There is
no suggestion in the statute or in § 81.44 of a deduction
of funds other than those later to be used exclusively for
charitable purposes.

2. Section 81.46 of Treasury Regulations 105 permits no
deductionfor a conditionalbequest to charity "unless
the possibility that charity will not take is so remote
as to be negligible."
Here, also, the regulations in their earliest form, in 1919,
were unequivocally restrictive.' It was only after court

decisions had demonstrated the need for doing so' that
the restrictions were restated so as expressly to permit
deductions of bequests assured in fact but conditional in
form.
Section 81.46 now provides expressly that no deduction
is allowable for a conditional bequest to charity "unless
the possibility that charity will not take is so remote as
to be negligible." The whole section is significant:
(a) If as of the
date of decedent's death the transfer to charity is
dependent upon the performance of some act or the
happening of a precedent event in order that it might
become effective, no deduction is allowable unless
the possibility that charity will not take is so remote
as to be negligible. If an estate or interest has passed
to or is vested in charity at the time of decedent's
death and such right or interest would be defeated
by the performance of some act or the happening
of some event which appeared to have been highly
improbable at the time of decedent's death, the
deduction is allowable.
"(b) If the legatee, devisee, donee, or trustee is
empowered' to divert the property or fund, in whole
or in part, to a use or purpose which would have
rendered it, to the extent that it is subject to such
power, not deductible had it been directly so bequeathed, devised, or given by the decedent, deduction will be limited to that portion, if any, of the
property or fund which is exempt from an exercise
of such power." (Emphasis supplied.) 26 CFR.

tually exclusive and easily reconcilable. The predecessor
of § 81.46 confined charitable deductions to outright,
unconditional bequests to charity. It expressly excluded
deductions for charitable bequests that were subject to
conditions, either precedent or subsequent. While it
encouraged assured bequests to charity, it offered no
deductions for bequests that might never reach charity.
Subsequent amendments have clarified and not changed
that principle. Section 81.46 (a) today yields to no condition unless the possibility that charity will not take
is "negligible" or "highly improbable." Section 81.46 (b)
is equally strict. It relates to provisions whereby
funds may be diverted in whole or in part to noncharitable uses, and it limits the tax deduction to that
portion of each fund that cannot be so diverted. Where
the principal of a bequest to charity thus may be invaded
for private purposes, it is only the ascertainable and
assured balance of the bequest to charity that is recognized for a tax deduction.
Respondent concedes that the chance that charity will
not take is much more than negligible. Therefore, if
§ 81.46 (a) applies to the instant case, no charitable
deduction is permissible.
Respondent claims, however, that § 81.44 covers this
case. In doing so, it reads §§ 81.44 and 81.46 together
and, instead of confining them to their mutually exclusive
subjects, makes them overlap. It applies § 81.44 to some
deferred conditional bequests. It does so in any case
where it can compute, on approved actuarial standards,
the degree of possibility that charity will receive the conditional bequest. Respondent then computes the present
value of a corresponding percentage of the entire deferred
bequest. In short, respondent claims an immediate tax
deduction equal to the present value of whatever fraction
of the bequest corresponds, actuarially, to the chance that
charity may benefit from it.

195

Opinion of the Court.

This Court considered a somewhat comparable proposal
in 1928. In Humes v. United States, 276 U. S. 487, a
taxpayer sought a charitable deduction based on a bequest to charity that was conditional upon the death of
decedent's 15-year-old niece, without issue, before reaching the age of 40. To. sustain the proposal, the taxpayer
sought to establish actuarially a measure of the chance
that charity would receive the bequest and to find
authority in the Revenue Code for the deduction of the
present value of a corresponding percentage of the
bequest. Speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis, this
Court found the actuarial computation inadequate. It,
however, did not drop the matter there. It made the
following statement:
"One may guess, or gamble on, or even insure
against, any future event. The Solicitor General
tells us that Lloyds of London will insure against
having twins. But the fundamental question in the
case at bar, is not whether this contingent interest
can be insured against or its value guessed at, but
what construction shall be given to a statute. Did
Congress in providing for the determination of the
net estate taxable, intend that a deduction should
be made for a contingency, the actual value of which
cannot be determined from any known data?
Neither taxpayer, nor revenue officer-even if
equipped with all the aid which the actuarial art
can supply-could do more than guess at the value
of this contingency. It is clear that Congress did
not intend that a deduction should be made for a
contingent gift of that character." (Emphasis supplied.) Id., at 494.
Since the above was written, there have been advances
in the actuarial art. Today, actuarial estimates are employed more widely than they were then. The computa-

tions now before us illustrate that advance. They do
not, however, lessen the necessity for statutory authorization for such a tax deduction. The scope of the authority
required by respondent can best be appreciated if examined in the revealing light of the specific circumstances
of the present case.
The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals have approved
respondent's actuarial computations as fairly reflecting
the present value of one-half of a two-million-dollar
residue, reduced in proportion to the chance that charity
will receive it. In making this estimate, respondent has
computed the present value of the deferred bequest on
the basis of 4% interest compounded annually and has
used the following actuarial tables:
1. To determine the joint life expectancy of decedent's
wife and daughter, the Combined Experience Mortality
Table prescribed in § 81.10 of the estate tax regulations.
2. To estimate the probability of remarriage of the
daughter, the American Remarriage Table, published by
the Casualty Actuarial Society.
3. To estimate the chance of a first child being born
to decedent's daughter, a specially devised table which
has been found by the Tax Court to have been prepared
in accordance with accepted actuarial principles upon
data derived from statistics published by the Bureau of
the Census.'
8 Despite the conclusions of the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals to the contrary, the Government contends here that the proposed actuarial value of the conditional remainder to charity does
not support the deduction. We do not reach that issue, but the
facts material to it are as follows: The Remarriage Table is based
on a study of American experience conducted by a Committee of the
Casualty Actuarial Society, 19 Proceedings of the Casualty Actuarial
Society (1933), 279-349. The table is based solely upon the remarriage experience of widows who, through the deaths of their husbands,
become beneficiaries under workmen's compensation laws in states

COMM'R v. STERNBERGER'S ESTATE.
187

197

Opinion of the Court.

On the basis of these tables, the Tax Court finds that
the present value of the charitable remainder at the
death of decedent is .18384 on the dollar if computed
solely on the chances of his daughter's remarriage;
.24094 on the dollar if computed on the chance that a
legitimate descendant of his daughter will survive her;
and .24058 on the dollar if computed on the chance that
any legitimate or illegitimate descendant of his daughter
will survive her. It is this last estimate that respondent
seeks to apply here.
If respondent is successful, it means the allowance of
an immediate and irrevocable deduction of over $175,000
from the gross estate of decedent, although respondent
admits there is a real possibility that charity will receive
nothing. The bequest, in fact, offers to the daughter an
inducement of about $2,000,000 to remarry and leave a
descendant. To the extent that this inducement reduces
the actuarially computed average probability that charity
will receive this bequest, it further demonstrates the inappropriateness of authorizing charitable tax deductions
based upon highly conditional bequests to charity.
An even clearer illustration of the effect of respondent's
interpretation of the code readily suggests itself. If
where they lose compensation benefits upon remarriage. The reports
relied upon cover experience for policy years 1921 to 1929, inclusive.
See id., at 286-288, 298. See also, Myers, Further Remarriage Experience, 36 Proceedings of the Casualty Actuarial Society (1949), 73
et seq. The specially devised table as to the probability of issue is
based upon statistics, for white women in 47 states and the District
of Columbia, indicating the degree of probability that such women,
after they are 27 years old, will marry and have first-born children.
See the following Bureau of the Census publications for 1940; Vital
Statistics of the United States, Pt. II, 89; Nativity and Parentage
of the White Population-General Characteristics 110; Types of

348 U. S.

decedent had here conditioned his bequest to charity
solely on the death of his daughter before remarriage, the
Remarriage Table would then fix the present value of the
charitable remainder at .18384 on the dollar. The taxpayer would at once receive a substantial charitable
deduction on that basis. The daughter, however, would
have a $2,000,000 inducement to remarry. If she did so,
her action would cancel the possibility that charity would
receive anything from the bequest, but it would not cancel
the tax deduction already allowed to the estate. To
whatever extent any person can defeat the fulfillment of
any condition upon which a benefit to charity depends,
to that extent the actuarial estimate that such benefit
will reach charity is less dependable. The allowance of
such a tax reduceLon as is here sought would open a door
to easy abuse. The result might well be not so much to
encourage gifts inuring to the benefit of charity as to
encourage the writing of conditions into bequests which
would assure charitable tax deductions without assuring
benefits to charity.
We find no suggestion of authority for such a deduction
in § 812 (d). That section remains substantially the
same as it was when Humes v. United States, supra, 276
U. S. 487. was decided. We also find no authorization
for the deduction either in § 81.46 or § 81.44 of the regulations, as thus far discussed. This relegates respondent
to the following words now in § 81.44 (d):
"If the present worth of a remainder bequeathed for
a charitable use is dependent upon the termination
of more than one life, or in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table A or B of §81.10, the claim
for the deduction must be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the computation of thepresent
worth made, in accordance with the principle set
forth in §81.10, by one skilled in actuarial computations." (Emphasis supplied.)

199

Opinion of the Court.

In view of the statutory emphasis upon outright bequests and the long-standing exclusion of conditional
bequests by § 81.46 of the regulations (and its predecessors), we do not regard the above sentence as now invading the domain of § 81.46 by extending the deduction
to conditional bequests. in a manner readily open to abuse.
We regard the sentence as restricted to computations of
deferred, but assured, bequests. Section 81.10 (i) now
deals at length with the valuation of remainders and
reversionary interests and gives many examples of such
computations. Every example, however, is one of the
valuation of an assured bequest. The additional language
in § 81.44 (d), quoted above, does not authorize the deduction, and § 81.46 prohibits it. Such specific and established administrative interpretation of the statute is valid
and "should not be overruled except for weighty reasons."
Commissioner v. South Texas Co., 333 U. S. 496, 501.
This Court has not specifically faced the issue now
before us since Humes v. United States, supra, but we see
no reason to retreat from the views there stated. This
Court finds no statutory authority for the deduction from
a gross estate of any percentage of a conditional bequest
to charity where there is no assurance that charity
will receive the bequest or some determinable part of
it. Where the amount of a bequest to charity has not
been determinable, the deduction properly has been denied. Henslee v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U. S. 595,
598-600; Merchants Bank v. Commissioner, 320 U. S.
256, 259-263; and see Robinette v. Helvering, 318 U. S.
184, 189. Where the amount has been determinable,
the deduction has, with equal propriety, been allowed
where the designated charity has been sure to benefit from
it. United States v. Provident Trust Co., 291 U. S. 272;
Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 151.
Some of the lower courts hae squarely met the instant
problem and denied the deduction. For example, the de-

Hoaglandv. Kavanagh, 36 F. Supp. 875; Wood v. United
States, 20 F. Supp. 197. The administrative practice, as
evidenced here by the action of the Commissioner, has
been to deny the deduction. See further, Paul, Federal
Estate and Gift Taxation (1946 Supp.), 426-427.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
reversed and the cause remanded for action in conformity
with this opinion.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE REED, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS

joins, dissenting.
The facts are fully and fairly stated in the Court's
opinion. its statement of the legal issues accords with
our understanding of the case, to wit:
"The question before us is what, if any, charitable
deduction may be made despite (1) the deferment
of the effective date of the charitable bequest until
the deaths of both decedent's wife and daughter and
(2) the conditioning of the bequest upon a lack of
descendants of decedent's daughter surviving at that
time."
The reason for dissenting, at some length, is that the
Court's conclusion seems to disregard the words of
the statute in question aid to subvert the purpose of
Congress in its enactment, that purpose admittedly being
to encourage testamentary gifts to corporations organized
for certain objects considered highly desirable for the good
of our people.1 There is a certain hesitation in dissent1 See note 3 of the Court's opinion.

ing from an interpretation of a tax statute remediable by
Congress, but as the Court's decision springs, we think,
from an overemphasis on regulations, a protest may have
usefulness as a counterweight against future extensions of
such treatment to statutory language.
First. The statute, 26 U. S. C. § 812 (d), allows as
deductions from the gross estate the "amount of all
bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers . . . to or for the
use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively
for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational
purposes . . . ." There is no legislative history explanatory of its meaning.2 If we read the quoted portion of
§ 812 alone, could there be any doubt that the Sternberger
bequest is deductible? We think not. It says "all
bequests"-whatever the charity takes under the will.
There is not a word that limits the deduction of bequests
to what assuredly goes to the institution, It is the
"amount" of the bequest that is deductible-its presently
ascertainable value. The statute plainly allows deferred
charitable bequests. It does not require assured
enjoyment.
Under the Court's interpretation, if a child were bequeathed his father's estate for life with remainder in
default of issue to the recognized institutions, the full
estate tax would have to be paid. On the other hand,
if the estate were left simply to the child for life and then
to the same institutions, the estate would be free from
the tax on the present value of the remainder. Such a
differentiation is not found in the statute. The Congress
said that charitable bequests should be deductible. The
valuation of the charitable interest in one instance would
be greater than in the other; the tax less. But in each
case the net estate would be reduced only by the present
actuarial value of the charitable bequest. While particu2

lar estates would secure tax advantages under our
interpretation, in the aggregate the charitable deductions
should substantially equal the amount received by the
tax-recognized institutions. This would surely fairly
carry out the congressional purpose. To view respondent's contention as urging a possible over-all tax windfall
for estates is to deny the mathematical law of averages.'
Our interpretation of the statute has support in the
language of Treasury Regulation 105, § 81.44. After
referring to the valuation of beqests whose value is
presently ascertainable, the regulation adds:
"If the present worth of a remainder bequeathed for
a charitable use is dependent upon the termination
of more than one life, or in any other manner rendering inapplicable Table A or B of § 81.10, the claim
for the deduction must be supported by a full statement, in duplicate, of the computation of the present
worth made, in accordance with the principle set
forth in § 81.10, by one skilled in actuarial
computations."
The tables refer to a remainder contingent on the termination of one life only. Section 81.44 alone would allow,
in the light of the statutory language, a deduction for a
contingent bequest, uncertain as to ultimate receipt. See
the Court's opinion, ante, pp. 198 and 199. The Court
does not follow this language of the Regulations because
of § 81.46 and because of "statutory emphasis upon

the Court states the actuarial method and assumes by not

reaching it, note 8 of the opinion, the correctness of the computation
of the value of the conditional remainder to charity, we will merely
add that this position accords with the conclusion of the Tax Court,
18 T. C. 836, and the Court of Appeals, 207 F. 2d 600, through its
reliance on Meierhof v. Higgins, 129 F. 2d 1002, 1003, a case also
involving the multiple-decrement theory. See Jordan, Life Contingencies, 251.

outright bequests." We find no such emphasis. The
purpose of the statute leads us to the contrary result.'
The Court agrees, however, with the Government's
contention that "it is immaterial whether the charity's
contingent possibility of receipt can be valued as of the
decedent's death." It holds that it is only when ultimate
receipt must follow that § 812 (d) allows a deduction.
Although the Government asserts its conclusion is upheld
by our decisions, we do not think they so hold. In this
Court five cases have touched upon the problem. Three
of them were disposed of because of the failure to introduce, or the impossibility of making, a valuation upon
sound actuarial principles.5 None of them held that
bequests are not deductible although the ultimate taking
by the charitable beneficiary was uncertain.
Two-Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 151,
and United States v. Provident Trust Co., 291 U. S. 272allowed 9 deduction for conditional charitable bequests.
The former because a right to invade the corpus was fixed
by a standard capable of being stated in money and, as
the income of the estate was ample for the needs of the

"The Court of Claims did not find that the present value of the
contingent bequests to the charities can be determined by the calculations of actuaries based upon experience tables ...
"If all the facts stated had been embodied in findings, no legal
basis would be laid for the deduction claimed. The volume and character of the experience upon which the conclusions drawn from these
two tables are based, differ from the volume and character of the
experience embodied in standard mortality tables, almost as widely
as possibility from certainty." 276 U. S., at 492-493.

members of the Scotch peerage. Merchants Bank v. Commissioner,

life beneficiary, there was no uncertainty sufficient to
justify a refusal of the deduction for the charitable remainder. The latter is, on its face, a decision that would
decide the issue, simpliciter, of the deductibility of contingent bequests. Neither is here controlling, however,
since in both the charity was held to be assured of taking.
The Provident Trust case is worth a moment's examination. Property was left by will in trust for the deceased's
daughter for life; upon her death the corpus was to pass
to her lawful issue; but should she die without issue, the
estate was to be distributed among various charitable
organizations. Prior to the death of the testator, an
operation had rendered the daughter incapable of childbearing, assuring the vesting of the charitable remainder.
This Court did not apply the then existing regulation
(the predecessor to § 81.46 (d)) ' which would have
denied a deduction. It ignored the regulation, apparently
believing it in conflict with the purpose of the statute,
and allowed the deduction, thus requiring the amendment
of the regulation to its present form. The Court stated
the relevant inquiry to be as follows:
"The sole question to be considered is-What is the
value of the interest to be saved from the tax? That
is a practical question, not concluded by the presumption invoked but to be determined
by ascertaining in terms of money what the property constituting that interest would bring in the market,

is dependent upon the performance of some act, or the happening of
some event, in order to become effective it is necessary that the performance of the act or the occurrence of the event shall have taken
place befQre the deduction can be allowed. Where, by the terms of
the bequest, devise or gift, it is subject to be defeated by a subsequent
act or event, no deduction will be allowed." Treas. Reg. 37, Art. 56.

subject to such uncertainty as ordinarily attaches to
such an inquiry. See Ithaca Trust Co. v. United
States . . . ." 291 U. S., at 286.
Our conclusion is that the purpose of § 812 was to allow
a deduction for charitable bequests that ,are capable of
valuation at the time of death, although it is not certain
that the gift will ultimately fall to the contingent beneficiary. See in accord Meierhof v. Higgins, 129 F. 2d
1002, a case in conflict with Newton Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 160 F. 2d 175, which ultimately led to the
allowance of this certiorari. The purpose of § 812 and
its background forbid, we think, a conclusion that Congress intended to exclude a deduction in those cases.
Second. The Government asserts and this Court agrees
that although it is clear that § 812 allows a deduction for
some contingent bequests, § 81.46 of the regulations
limits those contingencies to instances where the "possibility that charity will not take is so remote as to be
negligible." Clearly the possibility here is not "remote."
The chances are against the charity taking. It is quite
true that § 81.46 has survived reenactnent of I. R. C.,
§ 812, and that it can be interpreted as i limitation upon
the deductibility of contingent remainders. However,
we do not think such a ruling would be consistent with
the purpose of Congress, manifested by I. R. C., § 812.
Whether the Regulations are written into the Estate
Tax law by reenactment or are merely indicative of congressional purpose,7 the deduction section and the regulations are to be interpreted in the light of the congressional
purpose. Whatever may be the varying views as to the
desirability of testamentary gifts of moneys or businesses
I Compare Helvering v. Reynolds Co., 306 U. S. 110, 115; Crane v.
Commissioner, 331 U. S.1, 8, with Helvering v. Wilshire Oil Co., 308
U. S.90. See 54 Harv. L. Rev. 377, 398,1311.

to public or private charitable foundations, Congress has
sanctioned such provisions, vested or with certain degrees
of contingency, by the deduction section of the Estate
Tax.8 The policy has brought munificent gifts to the
chosen institutions.
If it were not for the reenactment of § 812 after the
promulgation of § 81.46, we would have no hesitation
in declaring it in conflict with the statute. Even in
interpreting statutes when isolated provisions would produce results "plainly at variance with the policy of the
legislation as a whole," we follow the purpose rather than
the literal words. United States v. American Trucking
Assns., 310 U. S. 534, 543. That rule is applicable here.
Regulations do not have the safeguards of federal statutory enactments. Interested parties outside the Internal
Revenue Service perhaps may not be heard. Reports
explaining the action are not available. Public discussion, such as happens in Congress, does not take place.
In short, we think that reenactment of a statute after the
due adoption of a regulation does not make the regulation
a part of the statute. It is only an indication of
congressional purpose to be weighed in the context
and circumstances of the statutory language. In this
instance the congressional purpose to encourage gifts
to charity should not be frustrated by the issuance
of a regulation.
For the foregoing reasons we would affirm the judgment
of the Second Circuit.
