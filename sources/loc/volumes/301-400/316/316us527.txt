Syllabus.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I dissent. I think the power of Congress does not
reach the purely local activities in question. If it did,
the commerce power alone would support regulation of
any local action, since it is conceivable that such activity,
however remotely, "affects" commerce or is "necessary"
to the production of goods for commerce.
But I am convinced that Congress never intended by
the statute to reach the employees of the petitioners.
Neither the words of the Act, nor its legislative history,
nor the purpose to be served, requires the application of
the statute in these cases.

HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE, v. CEMENT INVESTORS, INC.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 644. Argued April 27, 1942.-Decided June 1, 1942.
A plan for the reorganization of a corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiary in a proceeding under § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, provided for the creation of a new company which would assume the
obligations of the bonds of the parent company and would issue
income bonds and common stock in exchange for the first mortgage bonds of the subsidiary company, the latter having been
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the parent company.
Stockholders of the debtor companies were to receive in exchange
for their stock only warrants for the purchase of shares of the new
company. The plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court and
was consummated by a conveyance of the assets of the old companies to the new by the debtor companies, the bankruptcy trustee,
and the trustee under the indenture securing the bonds of the sub-

sidiary company. The new securities were issuable to, or on the
order of, the reorganization managers, acting as "agents" of the
security holders. Immediately after the consummation of the plan,
all of the issued shares of the new company (552,660 common shares
of an authorized 1,000,000) belonged to the former holders of the
bonds of the old subsidiary company. Nearly two years later, only
465 shares had been.issued to holders of warrants. Held:
1. The transaction was not a "reorganization" within § 112 (g)
(1) (B) of the Revenue Act of 1936 (Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Corp., 315 U. S. 194), nor within § 112 (g) (1) (C) of that
Act. P. 530.
2. The transaction satisfies the requirements of § 112 (b) (5) of the
Revenue Act of 1936, and no gain resulting therefrom to holders
of bonds of the subsidiary company is to be recognized. P. 531.
The legislative history of § 112 (b) (5) supports this conclusion.
3. The "reorganization" provisions of the Revenue Acts do not
furnish the exclusive methods for securing a deferment of gains or
losses arising out of transactions popularly known as corporate readjustments or reorganizations. P. 533.
4. Whether a tax liability in this case may have been incurred under
§ 112 (a)-a question not fairly within the issues as framed by
the Commissioner, and not decided below-is not here determined.

The issue presented by these cases is whether, under

§ 112(b)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 1648,

Opinion of the Court..

1678,26 U. S. C. § 112 (b) (5)), the gain of the taxpayers
from the transactions in question should be recognized.
The taxpayers owned first mortgage bonds of Colorado
Industrial Co., which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. The bonds were guaranteed both as to principal and interest by the parent company. After defaults on these bonds, and on other bonds
issued by the parent company, each company filed a petition under § 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. A plan of reorganization was formulated by committees of the security
holders. It provided for the formation of a new company,
to which all the assets of the two debtor companies would
be transferred. The new company would assume the obligations of the bonds of the old parent company, Colorado
Fuel and Iron Co., and issue income bonds , .,d common
stock in exchange for the bonds of the old subsidiary company, Colorado Industrial Co. The stockholders of the
debtor companies would receive no interest in the new
company; but in exchange for their stock they would receive warrants for the purchase of shares of the new company. Approval of the plan by the requisite percentage
of security holders was obtained. The plan was confirmed
by the court in April, 1936, and was duly consummated as
follows' The debtor companies, the bankruptcy trustee,
and the trustee under the indenture securing the bonds of
the old subsidiary company, conveyed the assets of the
debtors to the new company. The new securities were
issuable to, or on the order of, the reorganization managers,
who were acting, as stated in the plan, as "agents" of the
security holders. The reorganization managers effected
an exchange of the old securities for the new on or about
September 1, 1936. Immediately after the eonsummation
of the plan, all of the issued shares of the new company
(552,660 shares of common, out of an authorized issue of
1,000,000 shares) belonged to the former holders of the
bonds of the old subsidiary company. No stock was issued

by the new company to other parties until October, 1936,
when 37 shares were issued on exercise of the warrants.
By June, 1938, only 465 shares had been issued to holders
of the warrants.
Each of the taxpayers in these cases exchanged his
Colorado Industrial Co. bonds for income bonds and common stock of the new company In each case, the fair
market value of the new securities exceeded the basis of the
old. The Commissioner determined deficiencies on the
ground that the profit from the exchange was a taxable
gain. The Board of Tax Appeals held for the taxpayers.
See 42 B. T. A. 473. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed
(122 F. 2d 380, 416), holding, inter alia,that the exchange
met the requirements of § 112 (b) (5). We granted the
petitions for certiorari because the application of § 112 (b)
(5) to receivership or bankruptcy reorganizations raised
important problems in the administration of the income
tax law.
It is plain from Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated
Corp., 315 U. S. 194, which involved identical definitions of
the term "reorganization" as are involved here, that this
transaction does not meet the requirements of § 112 (g)
(1) (B) of the 1936 Act.' The assets of the old companies
were not acquired in exchange "solely" for voting stock of
the new company, since income bonds and warrants were
also'iisued. It is also clear that the requirements of § 112
(g) (1) (C) were not satisfied, since clause C "contemplates'that the old corporation or its stockholders, rather
than its creditors, shall be in the dominant position of
'In Helvering,v. Southwest Consolidated Corp., supra, no question

as to the applicability of § 112 (b) (5) was involved. The only question raised or considered by the Board or the Circuit Court of AplJeals,
or passed on by this Court, was whether or not the transaction in
question qualified as a "reorganization" under § 112 (g) (1) of the
1934 Act.

'control' immediately after the transfer and not excluded
or relegated to a minority position." Id., p. 202. But it.
does not necessarily follow that § 112 (b)- (5) is inapplicable. Sec. 112 (b) (5) provides:
"No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in
exchange for stock or securities in such corporation, and
immediately after the exchange such person or persons
are in control of the corporation; but in the case of an
exchange by two or more persons this paragraph shall
apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is substantially in proportion to his interest
in the property prior to the exchange."
"Control" is defined in § 112 (h) to mean
"the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 per centum
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
entitled to vote and at least 80 per centum of the total
number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation."
If it may be said that property was transferred by the
bondholders to the new corporation, then the other requirements of § 112 (b) (5) were satisfied. For the bondholders, as owners of all of the outstanding shares of the new
corporation, were in "control" of it "immediately after
the exchange." And it has not been disputed that the
stock and income bonds acquired by each bondholder were
substantially in proportion to his interest in the assets of
the debtor companies prior to the exchange. Petitioner;
however, maintains that the only transfer within the,
meaning of § 112 (b) (5) was effected by the debtor companies, the bankruptcy trustee, and the indenture trustee;
and that the exchange of the bonds for the new securities
was merely part of the mechanics for consummation of
the plan, and not an exchange by which "property" was

transferred to the new corporation. Though we agreed
with the latter proposition, it would not necessarily follow
that the requirements of § 112 (b) (5) were not met.
In case of reorganizations of insolvent corporations, the
creditors have the right to exclude the stockholders entirely
from the reorganization plan. When the stockholders are
excluded and the creditors of the old company become the
stockholders of the new, "it conforms to realities to date
their equity ownership" from the time when the processes
of the law were invoked "to enforce their rights of full
priority." Helveringv. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone Co.,
315 U. S. 179. Under that approach, the ownership of
the equity in these debtor companies effectively passed to
these creditors at least when § 77B proceedings were instituted. But however their interest in the property may be
described, it clearly was an equitable claim in or to it.
It was that equitable interest with which the plan dealt.
The transfer of the properties of the debtor companies to
the new corporation was made pursuant to that plan.
The plan was approved by the requisite percentage of
these creditors, as required by § 77B (e) (1) of the Bankruptcy Act. Thus it is fair to say that the property transferred was property in which the creditors had an equitable interest, and that the transfer was made with their
authority and on their behalf. Certainly, "property," as
used in § 112 (b) (5), includes such an interest in property.
And we see no reason to conclude that a beneficial owner
of, or equitable claimant to, property is precluded from
consummating an exchange which qualifies under § 112 (b)
(5) merely because the actual conveyance is made by his
trustee or title holder. In situations comparable to this
one, the Board of Tax Appeals has held that § 112 (b) (5)
is applicable. Leckie v. Commissioner, 37 B. T. A. 252;
Miller & Paine v. Commissioner, 42 B. T. A. 586. Cf.
Rockford Brick & Tile Co. v. Commissioner, 31 B. T. A.
537. We accept its view.

Opinion of the Court.

The legislative history of § 112 (b) (5) supports that
conclusion. Sec. 112 (b) (5) and the "reorganizaticw-"
provisions are rather closely related. See Miller, Hen',l
ricks, and Everett, Reorganizations and Other Exchanges
in Income Taxation (1931), ch. 6. While the "reorganization" provisions are restricted to inter-corporate transactions, § 112 (b) (5) is not so confined, since the phrase
"one or more persons" includes "individuals, trusts or
estates, partnerships and corporations." Treasury Reg.
94, Art. 112 (b) (5)-1. But there is no indication that the
"reorganization" provisions were designed as the exclusive method of deferring recognition of gain or loss in all
cases of corporate readjustments or reorganizations. The
history. of § 112 (b) (5) makes clear that it too was designed to function in that field (American Compress &
Warehouse Co. v. Bender, 70 F. 2d 655, 657-658) and to
permit •deferment of gains or losses where "there has been
a mere change in the form of ownership" or where the
taxpayer has not "closed out a losing venture." Portland
Oil Co. v. Commissioner, 109 F. 2d 479, 488. Sec. 112 (b)
(5) derives from § 202 (c) (3) of the 1921 Act. 42 Stat.
229, 230. Its legislative history shows that it was designed to permit "readjustments" 2 without present recognition of gain or loss by allowing property to be transferred to a controlled corporation by an individual, a part.nership, a corporation, or others.3 See Hearings, Senate
Committee on Finance, Proposed Revenue Act of 1921,

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

If a transaction meets the requirements of § 112 (b) (5),
the basis of the property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is the same as it would be in the hands of the
transferor. § 113 (a) (8). See P. A. Birren & Son, Inc.
v. Commissioner, 116 F. 2d 718. A similar result obtains
in case of a transaction which qualifies as a "reorganization." See § 113 (a) (7) (B). And the theory underlying the two basis provisions is the same. Miller,
Hendricks, and Everett, op. cit., pp. 304, 404; S. Rep. No.
398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., Committee Reports on the
Revenue Acts, 1913-1938, Int. Rev. Bull., pp. 278-279.
The close relationship between § 112 (b) (5) and the "reorganization" provisions is further evidenced by the fact
that they overlap to a degree. Thus, a transaction which
meets the requirements of clause B or clause C of § 112
(g) (1) may also qualify under § 112 (b) (5). In short,
the "reorganization" provisions do not furnish the exclusive methods for securing a deferment of gains or losses
arising out of transactions popularly known as corporate
readjustments or reorganizations. The instant transaction comes fairly within the family of business readjustments for which § 112 (b) (5) was designed. Hence the
fact that it cannot meet the statutory standards of a "reorganization" does not necessarily mean that it cannot
qualify as an "exchange," any more than the failure to
satisfy one clause of the "reorganization" provisions
means that none can be satisfied.
But the argument seems to be that, even though there
was an "exchange" which met the requirements of § 112(b)
(5), there was nevertheless a gain which is taxable. That
gain, it is suggested, arose from the acquisition by the taxpayers of their equitable interest in the properties in substitution for their old bonds. And it is argued that, unlike
the situation which obtains under the "reorganization"
provisions (Helvering v. Alabama Asphaltic Limestone
Co.. supra), § 112 (b) (5) covers only the exchange itself

and not the antecedent steps in connection with a plan of
reorganization. Thus the contention seems to be that,
since a gain arose from a transaction which was separate
and distinct from and anterior to the exchange of property
for the new securities, it must be recognized under the general rule of § 112 (a). We express no view on that contention. The deficiencies were not assessed on that transaction but only upon the exchange of stock and securities
in the new corporation for bonds of the old. We will not
consider here for the first time the question whether a tax
liability may have been incurred under § 112 (a) by reason
of the earlier transaction, a question not fairly within the
issues as framed by the Commissioner and hence not decided below.. Cf. Helvering v. Wood, 309 U. S. 344, 349.

Argued May 6, 1942.--Decided June 1, 1942.

1. A statute of Oklahoma provides for the sterilization, by vasectomy
or salpingectomy, of "habitual criminals"-an habitual criminal being defined therein as any person who, having been convicted two or
more times, in Oklahoma or in any other State, of "felonies involving
moral turpitude," is thereafter convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in Oklahoma for such a crime. Expressly excepted from
the terms of the statute are certain offenses, including embezzlement.
As applied to one who was convicted once of stealing chickens and
twice of robbery, held that the statute violated the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 537.
2. The State Supreme Court having sustained the Act, as applied to
the petitioner here, without reference to a severability clause, the
question whether that clause would be so applied as to remove the
particular constitutional objection is one which may appropriately
be left for adjudication by the state court. P. 542.
