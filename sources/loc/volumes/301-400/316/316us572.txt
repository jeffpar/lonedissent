OVERNIGHT MOTOR TRANSPORTATION CO., INC.
v. MISSEL.
.CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRtCUIT.

No. 939. Argued April 6, 7, 1942.-Decided June 8, 1942.
1. An employee of an interstate motor transportation company, who
acted as rate clerk and performed other incidental duties, held
"engaged in commerce" within the meaning of § 7 of the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938, and entitled to the benefit of its
overtime provisions. P. 574.
2. In the exercise of its power to regulate wages and hours of employment in interstate commerce, Congress may increase wages for
overtime, not merely to safeguard the health of employees, but
also to discourage overtime work, with a view to spreading employment and for other purposes. P. 576.
3. It is a purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act not merely to
increase substandard pay, but to discourage overtime work by
requiring extra pay for it even though the wages, as contracted
for and paid by the employer, for both regular hours and overtime,
exceed the statutory minimum. P. 577.
4. Section 7 (a) of the Act requires payment to the employee, for
overtime, of not less than one and one-half times the "regular
rate at which he is employed," meaning the rate actually agreed
on and paid by the employer if greater than the statutory minimum. P. 577.
5. Where the employment contract is for a-fixed weekly wage
and variable or fluctuating hours of work, the "regular rate"
in the statutory sense, for any particular week, is the quotient
of the amount paid per week divided by the number of hours
worked in that week. Walling v. Belo Corp., post, p. 624, dist'd.
P. 580.
6. The provision of § 16 (b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act making
an employer who violates § 6 or § 7 liable to the employees affected,
not only in the amount of his unpaid minimum wages or unpaid
overtime compensation, but in an additional equal amount as
liquidated damages,--held constitutional as applied to an employer
whose failure to comply resulted from inability to determine
whether the employee was covered by the Act. P. 581.

JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case involves the application of the overtime section of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 19381 to an employee working irregular hours for a fixed weekly wage.
"SEC. 7.

(a) No employer shall, except as otherwise provided in

this section, employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce
or in the production of goods for commerce(1) for a workweek longer than forty-four hours during the first
year from the effective date of this section.
(2) for a workweek longer than forty-two hours during the second
year from such date, or
(3) for a workweek longer than forty hours after the expiration of
the second year from such date,
unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half
times the regular rate at which he is employed." 52 Stat. 1063; 29

U. S. C. § 207.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

816 U. S.

Respondent, Missel, was an employee of the petitioner,
Overnight Motor Transportation Company, a corporation
engaged in interstate motor transportation as a common
carrier. He acted as rate clerk and performed other incidental duties, none of which were connected with safety
of operation. The work for which he was employed involved wide fluctuations in the time required to complete
his duties. The employment of respondent began before
the effective date of the Fair Labor Standards Act, October
24, 1938, and terminated October 19, 1940. Until November ,, 1938, his salary was $25.50 per week and thereafter $27.50. Time records are available for only a third
of the critical period, and these show an average workweek of 65 hours, with a maximum of 80 for each of two
weeks in the first year of the Act's operation and a maximum of 75 hours in each of three weeks in the second year.
Nothing above the weekly wage was paid, because these
maximum workweeks, computed at the statutory minimum rates with time and a half for overtime for the years
in question, would not require an addition to the weekly
wage.
Respondent brought a statutory action to recover alleged unpaid overtime compensation in such sum as might
be found due him, an additional equal amount as liquidated damages, and counsel fee.2 The trial court, refus-

'"Sac. 16....
"(b) Any employer who violates the provisions of section 6 or section 7 of this Act shall be liable to the employee or employees affected
in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal
amount as liquidated damages. ActiQn to recover such liability may
be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or

more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other
employees similiarly situated, or such employee or employees may designate an agent or representative to maintain such action for and in
behalf of all employees similarly situated.

The court in such action

ing to hear evidence on the precise amount claimed, decided in favor of the petitioner on the ground that an
agreement for a fixed weekly wage for irregular hours satisfied the requirements of the Act. Under such circumstances the court was of the view that pay would be
adequate which amounted to the required minimum for the
regular hours and time and a half the minimum for overtime. 40 F. Supp. 174. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiff
in accordance with its opinion, an order which we interpret
as authorizing a hearing in the trial court as to the amounts
due. 126 F. 2d 98. As the questions involved were important in the administration of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, we granted certiorari.
Petitioner renews here its contentions that the private
right to contract for a fixed weekly wage with employees
in commerce is restricted only by the requirement that the
wages paid should comply with the minimum wage schedule of the Fair Labor Standards Act, § 6, with overtime
pay at time and a half that minimum, that in any event
the Act does not preclude lumpsum salaries in excess of
the minimum, and that a contrary interpretation of the
statute would render it unconstitutional.
It is plain that the respondent as a transportation worker
was engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act,8
and unless specifically exempted was entitled to whatever:
benefits the overtime provisions conferred.

legislate against labor conditions detrimental to a minimum standard of living required for the general well-being
of workers, petitioner argues that there is no power under
the Constitution to regulate the hours or wages of workers
whose pay, in every instance, at least equals the minimum
and whose hours are not injurious to health. Freedom of
contract between employer and employee, it is urged, is
destroyed by such an interpretation.4 But hours or wages
not patently burdensome to health may yet be subject to
regulation to achieve other purposes. We assume here the
statutory objectives discussed later, i. e., that the Act is
aimed at hours as well as wages. The commerce power is
plenary, may deal with activities in connection with production for commerce,' and, as said in the Darby case,
mian'extend "to those activities intrastate which so affect
interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate
means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise
of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate
commerce." p. 118. Long hours may impede the free
interstate flow of commodities by creating friction between
production areas with different length work weeks, by
offering opportunities for unfair competition, through
undue extension of hours, and by inducing labor discontent apt to lead to interference with commerce through
interruption of work. Overtime pay probably will not
solve all problems of overtime work, but Congress may
properly use it to lessen the irritations. Substandard labor
conditions were deemed by Congress-to be "injurious to the
""It is Petitioner's contention that though the constitutionality is
clearly settled as to the question of correcting 'sub-standard labor conditions,' a,construction of the Act which has no relationship whatsoever to 'sub-standard labor conditions' would nonetheless be unconstitutional, for the potentiality of such a construction is to destroy freedom of contract between employer and employee."

commerce and to the states from and to which the commerce flows." United States v. Darby,312 U. S. 100, 115.
To protect that commerce from the consequences of production of goods under substandard conditions, it may
choose means reasonably adapted to those ends, including regulation of intrastate activities, p. 121, by minimum wage and maximum hour requirements, p. 123.
Compare Santa Cruz Co. v. Labor Board, 303 U. S.
453, 466. If overtime pay may have this effectupon'
commerce, private contracts made before or after the
passage of legislation regulating overtime cannot take

the overtime transactions "from the reach of dominant constitutional power." Norman v. B. & 0. R. Co.,
294 U. S. .240, 306-311.

If, in the judgment of Con-

gress, time and a half for overtime has a substantial effect
on these conditions, it lies with Congress' power to use it
to promote the employees' well-being.
Statutory Construction. The petitioner attacks the
basic conceptions upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals
determined that the compensation paid by the respondent
violated § 7 (a) of the Act.' That court felt that "one of
the fundamental purposes of the Act was to induce worksharing and relieve unemployment by reducing hours of
work." We agree that the purpose of the Act was not
limited to a scheme to raise substandard wages first by a
minimum wage and then by increased pay for overtime
work. Of course, this was one effect of the time and a half
provision, but another and an intended effect was to require extra pay for overtime work by those covered by
the Act even though their hourly wages exceeded the statutory minimum. The provision of § 7 (a) requiring this
extra pay for overtime is clear and unambiguous. It calls
for 150% of the regular, not the minimum, wage. By this
requirement, although overtime was not flatly prohibited,
'Note I supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

financial pressure was applied to spread employment to
avoid the extra wage and workers were assured additional
pay to compensate them for the burden of a workweek beyond the hours fixed in the Act. In a period of widespread
unemployment and small profits, the economy inherent in
avoiding extra pay was expected to have an appreciable
effect in the distribution of available work. Reduction of
hours was a part of the plan from the beginning. "A fair
day's pay for a fair day's work" was the objective stated
in the Presidential message which initiated the legisla tion.' That message referred to a "general maximum
working week," "longer hours on the payment of time and
a half for overtime" and the evil of "overwork" as well as
"underpay?" The message of November 15, 1937, calling
for the enactment of this type of legislation referred again
to protection from excessive hours. Senate Report No.
884, just cited, page 4, the companion House Report 1 "
and the Conference report 11 all spoke of maximum hours
as a separately desirable object. Indeed, the form of the
Act itself in setting up two sections of standards, § 6 for
wages and § 7 for hours, emphasizes the duality of the
Congressional purpose. The existence of such a purpose
is no less certain because Congress chose to use a less drastic form of limitation than outright prohibition of overtime. We conclude that the, Act was designed to require
payment for overtime at time and a half the regular pay,
where that pay is above the minimum, as well as where the
regular pay is at the minimum. 2

Opinion of the Court.

We now come to the determination of the meaning of
the words "the regular rate at which he is employed."
Since we have previously determined in this opinion, in
the discussion of letitioner's objection to the application
of the Act on the ground of unconstitutionality, that the
scope of the commerce power is broad enough to support
federal regulation of hours, we are concerned at this point
only with the method of finding the regular rate under the
contract with respondent. Congress might have sought
its objective of clearing the channel of commerce of the
obstacles of burdensome labor disputes by minimum wage
*legislation only. We have seen that it added overtime pay.
The wages for minimum pay are expressed in. terms of so
much an hour. Sec. 6 (a) (1)-"Not less than 25 cents an
hour" with raises for succeeding years or by order of the
Administrator under § 8. Cf. Opp Cotton Mills v. Admininstrator,312 U.S. 126. Neither the wage, the hour nor the
overtime provisions of §§ 6 and 7 on their passage spoke
specifically of any other method of paying wages except
by hourly rate." But we have no doubt that pay by the
week, to be reduced by some method of computation to
hourly rates, was also covered by the Act.1 ' It is likewise
abundantly clear from the words of § 7 that the unit of time
under that section within which to distinguish regular from
overtime is the week. "No employer shall . . . employ
any of his employees . . . (1) for a 'workweek longer than
forty-four hours .. .'
§ 7 (a) (1)." 5
"Sec. 3 (m) defined wage to include board, lodging or other facility
customarily furnished employees. The Joint Resolution of June 26,
1940, for work relief and relief for the fiscal year 1941, § 3 (f) deals
with piece work in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. 54 Stat. 611,
616.
"Any other interpretation would render almost useless the exemptions from the Act of employees in "executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity, or in the capacity of outside salesman." § 13 (a) (1). Such employees are rarely paid by the hour.
The legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act is inconclusive as to -the intended meaning of the words "the regular rate at which

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

316 U. S.

No problem is presented in assimilating the computation of overtime for employees under contract for a fixed
weekly wage for regular contract hours which are the actual hours worked,"e to similar computations for employees
on hourly rates. Where the employment contract is for a
weekly wage with variable or fluctuating hours the same
method of computation produces the regular rate for each
week. As that rate is on an hourly basis, it is regular in
bhe statutory. sense, inasmuch as the rate per hour does
:ot vary for the entire week, though week by week the
:egular rate varies with the number of hours worked. It
is true that the longer the hours, the less the rate and the
pay per hour. This is not an argument, however, against
this method of determining the regular rate of employment
for the week in question. Apart from the Act, if there is
a fiied weekly wage regardless of the length of the workweek, the longer the hours the less are the earnings per
hour. This method of computation has been approved by
each. circuit court of appeals which has considered such
problems. See Warren-BradshawDrillingCo. v. Hall, 124
F. 2d 42, 44; Bumpus v. Continental Baking Co., 124 F.
2d 549,552, cf. CarletonScrew ProductsCo. v. Fleming, 126
F. 2d 537,541. It is this quotient which is the "regular rate
at-which an employee is employed" under contracts of the
types described and applied in this paragraph for fixed
weekly compensation for hours, certain or variable.17
he is employed." The committee reports do not discuss them. The
bill which came out of the conference and was adopted changed "regu-

lar hourly rate" of previous bills (S. 2475, introduced May 24, 1937; H.
R. 7200, introduced May 24,1937; and S. 2475 in the Senate, April 20,
Calendar Day May 25, 1938) to "regular rate." Conference Report,
83 Cong. Rec. 9247, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. "Hourly" may have been
omitted as not descriptive of piecework or salary payments.
Wage divided by hours equals regular rate. Time and a half regular rate for hours employed beyond statutory maximum equals compensation for overtime hours.
" This has beenthe Administrator's interpretation of the Act. Interpretative Bulretin No. 4 issued October 21, 1938, revised November,

OVERNIGHT MOTOR CO. v. MISSEL.
572

Opinion of the Court.

Petitioner invokes the presumption that contracting
fparties contemplate compliance with law and contends
that accordingly there is no warrant for construing the
contract as paying the employee only his base pay or "regular rate," regardless of hours worked. It is true that the
wage paid was sufficiently large to cover both base pay
and fifty per cent additional for the hours actually worked
over the statutory maximum without violating section six.
But there was no contractual limit upon the hours. which
petitioner could have required respondent to work for the
agreed wage, had he seen fit to do so, and no provision for
additional pay in the event the hours worked required
minimum compensation greater than the fixed wage., Implication cannot mend a contract so deficient in complying with the law. This contract differs from the one in
Walling v. Belo Corp., post, p. 624, where the contract
specified an hourly rate and not less than time and a half
for overtime, with a guaranty of a fixed weekly' sum, ald
required the employer to pay more than the weekly guaranty where the hours worked at the contract rate exceeded
that sum.
In the Circuit Court of Appeals 8 it was held that th4
liquidated damages provision, § 16(b) of the Act, 52 Stat.
1069, was mandatory on the courts, regardless of the good
1940. While the interpretative bulletins are not issued as regulations,
under statutory authority, they do carry persuasiveness as an expression of the view of those experienced in the administration of the Act
and acting With the advice of a saj specializing in its interpretation and
application. -Cf. United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U. S.

faith of the employer or the reasonableness of his attitude.
Petitioner attacks this conclusion as a denial of due process because, if the damage provision is mandatory, the
employer is "without opportunity to test the issues before
thi courts," citing Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, Wadley
Southern Ry. Co. V. Georgia,235 U. S. 651, and other similar cases. Petitioner points out that, if there was a failure
to pay the statutory overtime, it resulted from an inability
to determine whether the employee was covered by the
Act.
Section 13 (b) (1)"0 exempts from § 7 employees for
whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power
to establish maximum hours of service. This exemption
was derived from the Motor Carriet Act of 1935, 49 Stat.
543, which authorized the Commission to regulate "maximum hours of service of employees." A definitive order
leaving employees with the duties of respondent subject
to the Fair Labor Standards Act was not passed by the
Commission-until March 4, 1941,'0 after respondent's employment ended. This conclusion, however, was foreshadowed by the ruling of the Commission, December 29,
193721 that it would limit regulations concerning maximum hours to employees whose functions affected the
safety of operations. Other orders, bulletins and opinions
pointing to the final conclusion intervened. 2 These various determinations now make it clear that respondent

Labor Standards Act to its provisions. The Interstate
Commerce Commission never had the power to regulate
his hours.
Perplexing as petitioner's problem may have been, the
difficulty does not warrant shifting the burden to the employee. The wages were specified for him by the statute,'
and he was no more at fault than the employer. The
liquidated damages for failure to pay the minimum wages
under §§ 6 (a) and 7 (a) are compensation, not a penalty
.or punishment by the Government. ' Cf. Huntington v.
