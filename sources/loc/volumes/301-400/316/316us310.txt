SEMINOLE NATION v. UNITED STATES.*
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 830.

Argued April 2, 1942.-Decided May 11, 1042.

1. The acquisition from the Creek Nation and the transfer to the
Seminole Nation, by the United States in 182, of a 175,000 acre
tract, held unrelated to an alleged deficiency in a tract previously
transferred to the Seminoles pursuant to Article III of the Treaty of
March 21, 1866, since at the time of the 1882 transfer no suggestion
of a deficiency in the treaty grant had been advanced. P. 315.
2. Under the Act of August 12, 1935, which, in the settlement of claims
against the United States by an Indian tribe, authorized offsets of
sums expended gratuitously by the United States for the benefit
of the tribe, the Court of Claims is required to find the amount of
the liability, if any, of the United States on the claim of the tribe,
and to designate and find the exact amount of the gratuitous expenditures which may be utilized to extinguish, in whole or in part,
that liability. P. 315.

Opinion of the Court.

Seminole Nation with respect to Article III of the Treaty
of March 21, 1866, 14 Stat. 755, 756, which provides in
part:
"... The United States having obtained by grant of
the Creek nation the westerly half of their lands, hereby
grant to the Seminole nation the portion thereof hereafter described, which shall constitute the national domain of the Seminole Indians. Said lands so granted by
the United States to the Seminole nation are- bounded
and described as follows, to wit: Beginning on the Canadian river where the line dividing the-Creek lands according to the terms of their sale to the United States by
their treaty of February 6, 1866, following said line due
north to where said line crosses the north fork of the
Canadian river; thence up said north fork of the Canadian river a distance sufficient to make two hundred
thousand acres by running due south to the Canadian
river; thence down said Canadian river to the place of
beginning. In consideration of said cession of two hundred thousand acres of land described above, the Seminole nation agrees to pay therefor the price of fifty cents
per acre, amounting to the sum of one hundred thousand
dollars, . . ."
Petitioner's claim is for just compensation for the alleged
taking by the United States of an asserted deficiency in
the tract granted by this Article.
Late in 1866, before the boundaries of the Seminole
domain had been located, the Seminoles moved to what
was assumed to be their treaty land.1 The first survey

Although negotiations were in progress with the Creeks at the time

the Seminole treaty was made and a treaty was signed with them on
February 6, 1866, the Creek treaty was not concluded until June

halves of the Creek country was not settled until the Bardwell survey
was approved in 1872.

of the line dividing the Creek and the Seminole territories, made by one Rankin, in 1868, under a contract
with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was not approved by the Department of the Interior. In 1871 one
Bardwell re-surveyed the dividing line and placed it seven
miles west of the Rankin line. Two months later, at
the direction of the Government, one Robbins ran the
western boundary of the Seminole lands so as-to include
200,000 acres from the Bardwell line. According to
Robbins' calculations, 200,000.03 acres were included between the Canadian river on the south, the north fork of
the Canadian river on the north, the Bardwell line on
the east and the Robbins line on the west. The Bardwell and Robbins surveys were both approved by the
Secretary of the Interior on February 5, 1872.
Meanwhile, pursuant to Article I of the Treaty of February 27, 1867, 15 Stat. 531,' the Pottawatomie tribe selected
a tract bounded "by the West line of the Seminole
lands," and on November 9, 1870, the Secretary of the Interior approved that selection. In 1872, after the location
of the Robbins line, the Pottawatomies occupied the territory immediately west of that line. Subsequently, the
Government allotted and patented the lands west of the
Robbins line to the Pottawatomies in severalty, or sold and
By that Article the United States agreed that a delegation from
the Pottawatomies should .accompany a government commission to the
Indian country ". . in order to select, if possible, a suitable location
for their people without interfering with the locations made for other
Indians; and if such location shall be found satisfactory to the Pottawatomies, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, such tract of
land, not exceeding thirty miles square, shall be set apart as a reservation for the exclusive use and occupancy of that tribe; and upon the
survey of its lines and boundaries, and ascertaining of its area, and
payment to the United States for the same, as hereinafter mentioned
and set forth, the said tract shall be patented to the Pottawatomie

nation."

patented them to settlers and turned the purchase price
into the Treasury as public money.'
The Bardwell survey disclosed that a considerable area
east of the Seminole-Creek dividing line had been occupied
by the Seminoles, who had made substantial improvements
on this land. In order that the Seminoles might retain the
lands which they had improved, Congress authorized negotiations for the purchase of these lands east of the Bardwell line. Act of March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 626. An agreement was entered into on February 14, 1881, with the
Creek Nation whereby that Nation ceded land east of the
Bardwell line to the United States, the agreement providing that the eastern boundary of the land ceded was to
be drawn so that the tract would aggregate 175,000 acres.

Creeks received $175,000 for this tract. Act of August 5,

1891, 26 Stat. 989, 1016-1017, the Pottawatomies ceded to the Govenment the tract assigned to them. It was stipulated in the agreement
that all allotments in-severalty, made or to be made, should be completed and confirmed, and that other allotments in severalty could be

petition filed in the Court of Claims in 1937,' the Seminole Nation alleged that, owing to an error in the location of the Robbins line, the territory enclosed between
the Robbins and Bardwell lines was 11,550.54 acres short
of 200,000 acres, and that the United States took from
the Seminoles 11,550.54 acres west of the Robbins line
when the Government patented that land to individuals
in 1892 and subsequent years. Judgment was prayed
against the United States for value at the time of taking
of the 11,550.54 acres, with interest at the rate of five
percent per annum. The Court of Claims made no finding as to whether a shortage in fact existed in the tract
between the Bardwell and Robbins lines, but held that, in
any event, the Seminole Nation was more than compensated- for the alleged shortage by the Government's
purchase for the Seminoles of 175,000 acres of land from
the Creek Nation. The court also stated that, even if
petitioner were entitled to recover for any deficit in the
200,000 acre tract, the Government would be entitled to
offset the value of the 175,000 acre tract as a gratuitous
expenditure under the Act of August 12, 1935, 49 Stat.
571, 596, a value assumed to be far in excess of the value
of whatever deficit there may have been. We granted
certiorari because of the close connection between this
case and Seminole Nation v. United States, No. 348,

suggests that the cause be remanded to the Court of
Claims.:
I
Underlying the denial of recovery for any deficit in the
200,000 acre tract because petitioner was compensated
therefor "fifteen-fold" by the receipt of an additional
175,000 acres, is the theory that the acquisition of land
by the Seminoles under the Treaty of 1866 and the acquisition of additional land to the east by transfer from the
Creeks in 1882 were but two parts of an integral transaction, intended to give the Seminoles 200,000 acres of
land and thus discharge the obligation of the Treaty of
1866. However, the facts do not support that theory, for
in 1882 the suggestion that a shortage existed in the supposed 200,000 acre tract between the Bardwell and Robbins lines had not yet been advanced. There was therefore no thought at the time the transfer of the 175,000
acre tract was made that the Government thereby fulfilled its treaty obligation by compensating the Semi- noles for a deficiency in the original tract.
II
The Act of August 12, 1935, 49 Stat. 571, 596, directs
the Court of Claims, in suits by an Indian tribe or band,
"to consider and to offset against any amount found due
the said tribe or band all sums expended gratuitously by
the United States for the benefit of the said tribe or band."
This language plainly requires the Court of Claims to find,
first, that money is due from the United States, to consider
then whether the United States has gratuitously spent
sums for the benefit of the tribe and, if it finds such gratuitous expenditures, to offset them against the amount
found due.
In allowing the gratuity offset here, the Court of Claims
fell short of complying with the requirements of the offset

statute. There was no finding that the United States was
under any liability to the Seminole Nation; the Court
stated only that the value of the 175,000 acre tract was
"far in excess of the value of whatever deficit there may
have been." The shortcomings of this approach are i'QX
dent. As we said in Seminole Nation v. UnitedStates NO.
348, ante, p. 286, gratuity offsets resemble a fund in a bank,
to be drawn on by the Government as needed. If the
Government owes nothing, it is entitled to a dismissal on
that ground, and should not be compelled to use its gratuity offsets. If liability exists on the Government's part,
the exact amount of gratuitous expenditures utilized to
extinguish that liability, in whole or in part, should be precisely founo1 and designated. The Government should not
be held to satisfy its liability by the use of gratuity expenditures in excess of the liability. Conversely, the Indian
tribe is entitled to have an exact determination of the
amount owed it by the United States in order that an
amount of gratuity expenditures equal to the liability may
be exhausted, or that, if the available offsets are insufficient,
it receive a money judgment for the difference. Otherwise, confusion and the possibility of a double credit for
a single offset arise, as this case and No. 348 abundantly
demonstrate. In the latter case, a gratuity offset in the
amount of $165,847.17 on account of the purchase of the
175,000 acre tract from the Creeks was allowed, and here
the assumed value of that tract is the offset employed by
the Court of Claims.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to
the Court of Claims with directions to consolidate it with
No. 348; to determine whether a shortage exists in the
200,000 acre tract; to determine. whether the Government
is liable therefor, and the amount of such liability, if a
shortage exists; and, to find and designate the precise
gratuitous expenditures used to offset the total liability,

SIOUX TRIBE OF INDIANS v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 798.

Argued April 10, 1942.-Decided May 11, 1942.

1. Orders of the President, in 1875 and 1876, withdrawing areas of
public lands from sale and settlement and setting them apart for
the use of the Sioux Indians as additions to their permanent treaty
reservation, conveyed no interest to the tribe for which it was
entitled to compensation from the United States when, by subsequent executive orders, the lands were restored to the public
domain. Pp. 325, 330.
2. Since the Constitution places the authority to dispose of public
lands exclusively in Congress, the Executive's power to convey any
interest in these lands must be traced to Congressional delegation
of its authority. P. 326.
3. The basis of decision in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236
U. S. 459, was that, so far as the power to withdraw public lands
from sale is concerned, such a delegation could be spelled out from
long-continued Congressional acquiescence in the executive practice. P. 326.
4. The answer to whether a similar delegation occurred with respect
to the power to convey a compensable interest in these lands to
the Indians must be found in the available evidence of what consequences were thought by the Executive and Congress to flow from
the establishment of executive order reservations. P.. 326.
5. There was no express constitutional or statutory authorization
for the conveyance of a compensable interest to the tribe by the
executive orders of 1875 and 1876, and no implied Congressional
delegation of the power to do so can be inferred from the evidence
of Congressional and executive understanding. P. 331.
