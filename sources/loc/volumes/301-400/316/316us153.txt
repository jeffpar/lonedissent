MUNICIPAL INVESTORS ASSOCIATION v.

BIRMINGHAM Et AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN.

No. 755. Argued April 1, 1942.-Decided April 27, 1942.
1. When asked to decide whether a contract has been impaired by
state legislation, in violation of the Contract Clause of the Constitution, this Court first ascertains whether the alleged contract
exists, even though, in so doing, it must determine questions of
state law which have not been decided by the state court. P. 157.
2. Provisions in a municipal charter for making "an additional pro rata
assessment" to supply the deficiency when any special assessment
shall "prove insufficient" to pay for the improvement for which
it was levied, and declaring that the special assessment district
bonds issued to pay for an improvement shall "be payable out of
the special assessment district fund when the assessment is collected"; together with provisions in the bonds whereby, the
municipality promises to pay the principal and interest "from the
special assessment fund created for the purpose," and pledges its
full faith and credit for the payment of each bond "from the special
assessment fund created for the purpose when the same shall have
been collected," do not establish a contractual right in the bondholders to require that the municipality, in order to meet deficiencies in the collection of assessments, shall re-assess lots in the
improvement district which have been sold for non-payment of
the original assements. P. 158.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

APPEAL

316 U. S.

from a judgment refusing a writ of mandamus

to compel the City of Birmingham to levy an additional
special assessment on land in a special improvement district.
Mr. Claude H. Stevens for appellant.
Messrs. Herbert J. Rushton, Attorney General of Michigan, Ferris D. Stone, FredericS. Glover, Jr., and Harry
Allen were on the brief for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE REED

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This appeal challenges a decision of the Supreme Court
of Michigan, which upheld the constitutionality of Michigan statutes' extinguishing unmatured special assessments, tax liens or other encumbrances on land sold for
tax delinquency, and which therefore refused a writ of
mandamus to compel the City of Birmingham to levy an
additional special assessment on land so sold, to pay defaulted paving bonds issued in 1928 by its predecessor, the
Village of Birmingham. 298 Mich. 314, 299 N. W. 90.
The appellant, Municipal Investors Association, as holder
of these bonds, claims to have a contract right under the
law of Michigan in 1928 to require such an additional assessment, and asserts that the subsequent Michigan statutes construed to prevent the levy impair the obligation
of its contract contrary to Article I, § 10 of the United
States Constitution.
Determination of this Court's jurisdiction of the appeal
was postponed to the hearing of the case upon the merits.
We think that the constitutionality of the two 1937 statutes upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court was sufficiently and seasonably drawn in question in appellant's
reply, and that the jurisdictional requirements of § 237
'Acts Nos. 114, 155, Mich. Pub. Acts of 1937.

of the Judicial Code (28 U. S. C. § 344) are satisfied. Appellant challenged the Acts as violative of the Contract
Clause. But we find it unnecessary to consider the effect
or validity of these statutes, for we think the appellant
has failed to establish any contract right to an additional
assessment after a sale to enforce an assessment lien under
the preexisting Michigan law, in force when the bonds
were issued.
The decision refusing mandamus for an additional assessment was entered on the pleadings. These disclose
that the Village of Birmingham, in order to pay the cost
of paving certain streets, took proceedings in 1928 to assess
23.4% of the cost to the Village at large, and 76.6% to the
property abutting the improvement, Special Assessment
District No. 146. The property assessment was payable
in five equal annual installments commencing with 1928.
Of one hundred and ten parcels in District No. 146, about
one hundred never paid their shares of the assessment,
were offered for sale for these and other unpaid taxes at
the annual tax sale of 1938, and were bid in by the State
of Michigan. They were not redeemed, and were later
sold by the State. About ten parcels in the District paid
their shares of the paving assessment and have never been
sold for taxes.
In anticipation of the collection of this special assessment the Village had issued in 1928 seventeen annually
maturing serial 51/% bonds. Of these, No. 1 to No. 7 appear to have been paid, No. 8 to No. 11 were refunded,
and No. 12 to No. 17, which are held by appellant, have
all been in default both as to interest and principal at
least since October 1, 1933. A negligible amount is on
hand in the special assessment fund, and not over 20% of
the amount still owing will be realized from the District's
share in the proceeds of the tax sales. In order to replenish the fund, the appellant seeks to compel the de-

fendants by the laws in force when the bonds were issued
to levy upon all the land in the District, including the lots
previously sold for taxes and the original assessment, an
additional assessment equal to the unpaid principal and
interest.
The general Act under which the Village was incorporated listed among the permissible charter powers a provision "for assessing and reassessing the cost, or any portion thereof, of any public improvement to a special district," Act No. 278, Public Acts of 1909, § 24 (e); Mich.
Comp. Laws (1929) § 1786 (e).2 Pursuant to this authorization, § 15 of Chapter XXI of the village charter provided: "Should any special assessment prove insufficient
to pay for the improvement or work for which it was levied,
and the expenses incident thereto, the Commission may
make an additional pro rata assessment to supply the deficiency; and in case a larger amount shall have been collected than was necessary, the excess shall be refunded
ratably to those by whom it was paid."' Section 22 of
Chapter XX of the charter stated that special assessment
'The same act stated that "No village shall have power: ... To
issue any bonds without creating a sinking fund for the payment of
the same, except special assessment bonds which are a charge upon a
special district created for the payment thereof, and serial bonds payable annually." Act No. 278, Public Acts of 1909, § 26 (k); Mich.
Comp. Laws (1929) § 1788 (k).
'Section 18 of Chapter X of the charter of the City of Birmingham,
adopted in 1933, makes provision for an additional assessment to meet
insufficiencies in special assessments "for any cause, mistake or inadvertence." Section 12 of Chapter XVIII makes these provisions effective for the village debts where legally applicable. Obviously,
unless the village charter provision in effect when the bonds were issued authorized additional assessments to meet deficiencies, the city
clause could not add that burden to the lots. It would be applicable
only if it were a means of enforcing an existing right. Cf. In re Farm

Opinion of the Court.

bonds should "be payable out of the special assessment
district fund when the assessment is collected." In the
bonds themselves the Village promised to pay the principal and interest, "said principal and interest however,
being payable from the Special Assessment fund created
for the purpose . ..
The full faith and credit of the Village of Birmingham are hereby pledged for the punctual
payment of the principal and interest of this bond from
the special assessment fund created for the purpose, when
the same shall have been collected."
The Michigan Supreme Court assumed, without deciding, that these various provisions did include in the
bondholders' contract a right to additional assessments
after a tax sale for the payment of deficiencies attributable to non-payment of valid prior assessments. 298
Mich. 314, 319, 299 N. W. 90, 92. As a contract must
exist before it can be impaired, and as our conclusion
against existence of the contract right settles this case,
we feel it proper to consider only whether there was a contract between the bondholders and the Village for an additional assessment on the district property to meet deficiencies, instead of undertaking the resolution of the
constitutional issue presented by the challenged statutes
of Michigan. While this approach forces us to decide
the meaning of Michigan legislation without the assistance of the courts of that State, it is necessary to do so
because of the obligation of this Court to determine for
itself the basic assumptions upon which interpretations
of the Federal Constitution rest.'
The complete charter of the Village is not before us.
From the authorized power granted by the Public Act of
1909 under which it was organized, however, from the

language in § 15 of Chapter XXI of the charter providing
for "an additional pro rata assessment" and from the
terms of the bond, limiting its payment to "the special
assessment fund created for the purpose, when the same
shall have been collected," we are satisfied there was no
contract to reassess lots once sold for the original assessment. If the stated powers of the Village to levy an
assessment on improvement district property required
that the lots assessed, after sale for default in their installments, should be subject to an additional assessment to
cover such deficiencies, the burden might depress their
value to a point where little if anything could be realized
for the bondholders, and successful sale for non-payment
would be frustrated. This would clearly be true where,
as here, a very large proportion of the assessments were
defaulted. A prospective investor in the bonds must look
ultimately to the sale of each lot for the payment of the
amount assessed against that particular parcel.5
Section 15 of the village charter authorizes an additional
assessment when the original assessment proves insufficient to pay for the improvement. Assessment bonds may

be based on undertakings whereby benefited lands may
be liable even after they were sold to pay the assessment
liens upon them to recover for defaults in sales of other
assessed properties. See Kadow v. Paul, 274 U. S. 175.
But in the absence of controlling Michigan law, § 15 repels
such a construction. The language falls far short of subjecting lots which have been sold to pay tax or assessment
liens to an additional assessment for the deficit. Such a
construction would defeat the remedy of tax sales as a
means of realizing the assessment lien.
The opinion of the Supreme Court of Michigan does not
deal specifically with the status of the lots which have not
been sold to satisfy the assessments. In the absence of
an assignment of error upon that ground, we express no
opinion thereon.
