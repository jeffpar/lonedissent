CERTIORARI

No. 231.

TO THE

COURT OF CLAIMS.

Argued January 7, 1938.-Decided January 31, 1938.

1. Review by this Court of a judgment of the Court of Claims
against the United States in a suit for infringement of a patent,
brought under the Act of June 25, 1910, as amended, is limited to
questions of law. P. 28.
2. In a )'atent case in the Court of Claims under the Act of 1910
the questions of validity and infringement are questions of fact.
P. 29.
3. The duty of the Court of Claims to find the ultimate facts, requires that it resolve conflicting inferences and draw the necessary
factual conclusions from the evidence. Id.
4. The Court of Claims made elaborate circumstantial findings preceding its two ultimate findings that the patent sued on was valid
and infringed by the United States. Its opinion disclosed that
there was contradictory testimony by experts for the claimant
and for the United States, but the evidence was not, and could
not properly be, incorporated in the record before this Court. Held
that while this Court could inquire whether the ultimate findings
were necessarily overborne by the subordinate ones, thus showing that the judgment against the United States was not sustainable in point of law, it could not take up the patents set forth
in the findings and, in the absence of the explanatory and construing testimony of the expert witnesses, attempt to pass upon
the various questions involved, and upon such a necessarily limited consideration overrule the conclusions of fact reached by the
Court of Claims upon the entire record. P. 30.
84 Ct. Cls. 625, affirmed.

Reed, Assistant Attorney General Whitaker, and Messrs.
Alexander Holtzoff and Lee A. Jackson were on the brief,

U. S. v. ESNAULT-PELTERIE.

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. George T. Bean and Eugene V. Myers, with
whom Messrs. R. Keith Kane and Edwin J. Brindle were
on the brief, for respondent.
PER CURIAM.

Respondent brought this suit to recover compensation
for the use and manufacture by and for the United States
of a device alleged to be covered by respondent's patent
No. 1,115,795 for an invention for the control of the
equilibrium of airplanes. Ca the first hearing, the Court
of Claims made special findings of fact and decided as a
conclusioin of law that respondent's patent was valid and
had been infringed by the United States and that respondent was entitled to compensation. Judgment was entered
accordingly. 81 Ct. Cls. 785. On review by writ of certiorari, this Court held that validity and infri.igement
were ultimate facts to be found by the Court of Claims
and, as these facts had not been found, the judgment was
vacated and the case was remanded to that court with
instructions to find specifically whether respondent's patent was valid and, if so, whether it had been infringed.
United States v. Esnault-Pelterie,299 U. S. 201.
The parties then moved in the Court of Claims for additional findings and that court amended its special findings by adding the following findings of fact:
"XLVIII. Claims 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the EsnaultPelterie patent in suit are valid.
"XLIX. The three alleged infringing airplanes of the
defendant all possess the single vertical lever movable
in every direction for controlling the lateral or longitudinal equilibrium of the airplane, connected to equivalent
controlling surfaces having the same functional effects
as those disclosed in the patent.
"Claims 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the Esnault-Pelterie patent in suit are infringed by defendant."

The court then entered an interlocutory judgment holding respondent entitled to compensation and directing
that the court's previous findings, as amended, together
with its opinion as theretofore announced, should stand.
84 Ct. Cls. 625. Certiorari was granted.
Without its consent, the United States may not be sued
for infringement of a patent. Crozier v. Krupp, 224 U. S.
290. The Congress has determined the conditions upon
which the United States consents to be sued. By the
applicable statute Congress has permitted suit to be
brought in the Court of Claims for reasonable compensation for the infringing use or manufacture. Act of June
25, 1910, 36 Stat. 251, as amended by Act of July 1, 1918,
40 Stat. 705. 35 U. S. C. 68. Review by this Court of
the judgment in such a suit is thus subject to the rules
which have been established for the review of the judgments of the Court of Claims. That eview is limited to
questions of law.
The Act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, 12 Stat. 765, providing
for suits against the United States in the Court of Claims,
authorized appeals to this Court under such regulations
as this Court should direct. See, also, Act of March 3,
1887, c. 359, ยง 4, 24 Stat. 505, 506. 28 U. S. C. 761. The
rules fiA adopted provided for the finding of the facts
by the Court of Claims and directed that "The facts so
found are to be the ultimate facts or propositions which
the evidence shall establish, in the nature of a special
verdict, and not the evidence on which the ultimate facts
are founded." Rule 1, 3 Wall. vii. The present rule,
under ยง 3 (b) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43
Stat. 936, governing review upon certiorari, is to the same
effect. Rule 41, par. 3. This established practice was
thus described in Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States,
272 U. S. 533, 538, 539:
"This Court uniformly has regarded the legislation and
rules as confining the review to questions of law shown by

Opinion of the Court.

the record when made up as the rules direct.

Bills of

exception are not recognized in either the legislation or
the rules; nor is there other provision for bringing the
evidence into the record or including therein the various
rulings involved in applying to the evidence presented the
rules which mark the line between what properly may be
considered and what must be rejected. As long ago as
Mahan v. United States, 14 Wall. 109, 111, this Court
said of the rules that they could not be examined 'without
seeing that the purpose was to bring nothing here for
review but questions of law, leaving the Court of Claims
to exercise the functions of a jury in finding facts,
equivalent to a special verdict and with like effect.' "1
In a patent case in the Court of Claims under the Act of
1910 the questions of validity and infringement are questions of fact. We have said that, for the purposes of our
review in such a case, the findings of the Court of Claims
"are to be treated like the verdict of a jury, and we are
not at liberty to refer to the evidence, any more than to
the opinion, for the.purpose of eking out, controlling, or
modifying their scope." Brothers v. United States, 250
U. S. 88, 93; Stilz v. United States, 269 U. S. 144, 147,
148; United States v. Esnault-Pelterie,supra. The requirement that the Court of Claims should find the ultimate facts which are controlling places upon that court
the duty of resolving conflicting inferences and to draw
from the evidence the necessary conclusions of fact.
United States v. Adams, 6 Wall. 101, 112. Even though
the finding determines a mixed question of law and fact,
the finding is conclusive unless the court is able "to so
separate the question as to see clearly what and where
the mistake of law is." Ross v. Day, 232 U. S. 110, 117;
1 See,

also, United States v,Smith, 94 U. S. 214; Stone .v. United

States, 164 U. S. 380, 383; Collier v. United States, 173 U. S. 79;
Crocker v. United States, 240 U. S. 74; Niles Bement Pond Co. v.
United States, 281 U. S. 357, 360.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

303 U. S.

United States v. Omaha Indians, 253 U. S. 275, 281;
Stilz v. United States, supra; United States v. Swift &
Co., 270 U. S. 124, 138.
In the instant case, as pointed out in our previous
opinion, there are 47 findings of fact preceding the findings of the ultimate facts, as now made, and by reference
there are included 28 exhibits on 266 pages. These references cover a number of patents claimed to be in analogous arts. From these, the Government seeks to establish that the device in question vas not patentable
over prior disclosures. But this is not a case where the
Court of Claims has presented in its findings all the evidence upon which the ultimate facts are based so that it
appears on the face of the findings that the judgment
is necessarily wrong as matter of law. United States v.
Clark, 96 U. S. 37, 40. Cf. United States v. Berdan FireArms Co., 156 U. S. 552, 573; Stone v. United States, 164
U. S. 380, 383. The opinion of the Court of Claims contains an elaborate review of the patents to which reference is made, and it discloses that there was "considerable
contradictory testimony" by the various experts for the
plaintiff and the defendant. That testimony is not here,
and would not appropriately form part of the record
brought to this Court, as it was the duty of the court below, and is not ours, to deal with the conflicts of statement or inferences to which it might give rise. We are
not unmindful of the rule that where, with all the evidence before the court, it appears that no substantial
dispute of fact is presented, and that the case may be determined by a mere comparison of structures and extrinsic
evidence is not needed for purposes of explanation, or
evaluation of prior art, or to resolve questions of the application of descriptions to subject-matter, the questions
of invention and infringement may be determined as
questions of law. Heald v. Rice, 104 U. S. 737, 749;
Singer Mfg. Co. v. Cramer, 192 U. S. 265, 275; Sanitary

U. S. v. ESNAULT-PELTERIE.
26

Opinion of the Court.

Refrigerator Co. v. Winters, 280 U. S. 30, 36. But we do
not think that rule is applicable where we are unable to
examine the testimony which was heard by the court below and we cannot say that it was of no importance or
determine its value in the light of the disputes revealed.
We should not be justified in taking up the patents set
forth in the findings and, in the absence of the explanatory and construing testimony of the expert witnesses
with respect to the pertinent fact situations, in attempting to pass upon the various questions, whether of a scientific nature or otherwise, that are involved and upon such
a necessarily limited consideration in overruling the conclusions of fact reached by the Court of Claims upon the
entire record. Cf. Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812, 815,
816; Royer v. Schultz Belting Co., 135 U. S. 319, 325;
St. Paul Plow Works v. Starling, 140 U. S. 184, 196, 197;
Coupe v. Royer, 155 U. S. 565, 577-580.
We may, of course, inquire whether the subordinate or
circumstantial findings made by the court below necessarily override its ultimate findings of fact and show that
the judgment in point of law is not sustainable. But we
have no such case here. Nor is the case like that of a
review by a Circuit Court of Appeals of decisions of
boards, such as the Board of Tax Appeals, where the evidence is before the appellate court and the question is
whether there was substantial evidence before the Board to
support the findings made. Cf. Phillips v. Commissioner,
283 U. S. 589, 600; Helvering v. Rankin, 295 U. S. 123,
131; Helvering v. Tex-Penn Co., 300 U. S. 481, 491. We
must take the findings of fact as made below. If, in the
instant case, the subordinate findings had required a decree in favor of the Government the case would not have
been remanded. United States v. Esnault-Pelterie,supra,
p. 206; Botany Mills v. United States, 278 U. S. 282,
290; United States v. Wells, 283 U. S. 102, 120. And it
cannot be said that the ultimate findings, now made, as

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.

to validity and infringement are necessarily overborne by
the subordinate findings.
The argument that the Government is precluded from
obtaining the sort of review which is permissible in this
Court, when there is a conflict between circuit courts of
appeals as to validity and infringement of patents, and
the questions are submitted upon the evidence taken in
the District Court, is unavailing, for the result is due to
the procedure which has been established by the Congress
for the determination of claims against the United States.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK is of the opinion that the findings do not show infringement of any valid patent; or
that Appellee invented either a vertical lever or a universal joint or the combined use of a vertical lever and
a universal joint to control air planes or machinery; he
believes the findings show that such means of control
were in general use long before Appellee-five years
after his original application for a patent-filed an
amendment asserting this claim. For these reasons he
believes the judgment should be reversed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO took no part in the considera-

tion and decision of this case.
