HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE,. v. MITCHELL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FUR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 324.

Argued January 14, 1938.-Decided March 7, 1938.

Section 293 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1928, Title I, provides that,
if any part of a deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade
tax, 50% of the total amount of the deficiency (in addition to
such deficiency) shall be assessed, collected and paid. Section
146 (b) of the same Title declares that any person who wilfully
attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by
the Title, shall, in addition to other penalties provided" by law, be
guilty of a felony and upon conviction be subject to fine and
imprisonment.
Held: That an acquittal of a charge of wilful attempt to evade,
under § 146 (b), does not bar assessment and collection of the
.397 et seq.
50% addition prescribed by § 293 (b).
The doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable because of the difference in quantum of proof in civil and criminal cases; the acquittal
was merely an adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to
overcome all reasonable doubt of guilt. P. 397.
The doctrine of double jeopardy is inapplicable because the 50%
addition to tax provided by § 293 (b) is not primarily punitive
but is a remedial sanction imposed as a safeguard for protection of
the revenue and to reimburse the Government for expense and
loss resulting from the taxpayer's fraud. As such it may be
enforced by a civil procedure to which the accepted rules and

ing in part a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 32
B. T. A. 1093, which sustained a deficiency income tax
assessment, with a 50% addition for fraud.
Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum, with whom Solicitor General Reed, Assistant Attorney General Morris, and
Messrs. Sewall Key and Lucius A. Buck were on the
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. William Wallace for respondent.
The fifty per centum addition to the tax deficiency
is a penalty intended for punishment.
As fraud presupposes a plan conceived before its execution, it must of necessity be wilful. There can be no act
of fraudulent evasion under § 293 (b) that would not also
be a wilful evasion under § 146 (b). The penalty prescribed by § 293 (b) is imposed only because of acts
which, when committed, constitute-a crime.
The fact that the words "tax" or "addition to the
deficiency" are used to describe the imposition, or that
collection is made through the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Treasury Department, is of no significance
if the real purpose of the imposition is to define and
suppress a crime. Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20;
Helwig v. United States, -188 U. S. 605; Dorsheimer v.
United States, 7 Wall. 166.
Even though termed a tax, the assessment is under
suspicion of not being a true tax, when levied because
of illegal acts. United States v. La Franca,282 U. S. 568.
If "evidence of a crime is essential to the imposition of

a tax, the courts do not hcsitatc to pronounce it a penalty, even if it may incidentally bring in revenue." Regal
Drug Corp. v. Wardell, 260 U. S. 386; Lipke v. Lederer,
269 U. S. 557. Nor does the fact that the penalty maybe superimposed on what is clearly a tax lessen the penal
character of the former. Helwig v. United States, supra,
614-616; 17 Ops. Atty. Gen. 433; 23 Ops. Atty. Gen. 398.
A review of the decisions of this Court compels us to
the conclusion that (1) if a so-called tax is meant primarily to suppress a certain kind of conduct, rather than
to supply regular revenue for the support of the Government, or (2) if the addition is greatly out of proportion to the ordinary tax, or (3) if it is levied upon a
particular act because of its fraud, then it is regarded
as a penalty and punishment rather than a mere tax.

All of the cases above cited which held the addition
to be a penalty or punishment were civil in their nature.
In all of them the rules of evidence and of procedure
applicable to civil actions were applied, except that the
defendant could not be compelled to bear witness against
himself. Lees v. United States, 150 U. S. 476, 480; Boyd
v. United States, 116 U. S. 616. This application of rules
of civil procedure included admissibility of evidence,

proof, United States v. Regan, 232 U. S. 37, and direction
of verdicts, Hepner v. United States, 213 U. S. 103. The
penalties were either assessed by administrative officials
or sued for in a civil action.

Despite the fact that the statutory provisions so enforced were civil in their nature, or at most quasi criminal-this term was applied to them in Boyd v. United
States, supra, (p. 634)-they were uniformly held to be
penalties, i. e., punishment for wrongful conduct. In
none of the cases did the fact of adherence to the civil
forms of action militate against a determination that the
imposition was penal in character. Oceanic Navigation
Co. v. Stranahan,214 U. S. 320, distinguished.
Neither the method of collection nor the taxpayer's
inability to invoke the aid of equity to enjoin collection
are determinative of the punitive character of such additions. Helwig v. United States, supra; United States v.
Chouteau, 102 U. S. 603, 611; Dorsheimer v. United
States, supra.
In Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, no question of double jeopardy was presented nor did the Court
by using the word "compensatory" mean to detract from
the essentially punitive character of the penalty.
The constitutional provisions against double jeopardy
bar any present imposition of the fifty per centum addition to the tax. Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616;
Murphy v. United States, 272 U. S. 630; United States v.

Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, § 293, 45 Stat. 791, provides, in dealing with assessment of deficiencies in income
tax returns:
"(b) Fraud.-If any part of any deficiency is due to
fraud with intent to evade tax, then 50 per centurn of the
total amount of the deficiency (in addition to such deficiency) shall be so assessed, collected and paid. .. ."
The question for decision is whether assessment of
the addition is barred by the acquittal of the defendant
on an indictment under § 146 (b) of the same Act for
a wilfull attempt to evade and defeat the tax.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that
Charles E. Mitchell of New York had, in his income tax
return for the year 1929, fraudulently deducted from admitted gross income an alleged loss of .$2,872,305.50 from
a purported sale of 18,300 shares of National City Bank
stock to his wife; that he had fraudulently failed to return the sum of $666,666.67 received by him as a distribution from the management fund of the National City
Company, of which he was chairman; and that these
fraudulent acts were done with intent to evade the tax.
On December 8, 1933, the Commissioner notified 1\Iitchell
that there was a deficiency in his tax return of $728,709.84
and, on account of the fraud. a 50 per cent. addition
thereto in the sum of $364,354.92.
Mitchell appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which
sustained the Commissioner's determination. 32 B. T. A.
1093. Upon a petition for review, the Circuit Court of
Appeals concluded that there was ample evidence to support the Board's findings that Mitchell had fraudulently
made deduction of the loss and that he had fraudulently
failed to return the amount received from the management fund; and that, despite the facts hereafter stated.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of Ilhe Court.

303 U. S.

the Board was free to find the facts according to the evidence. It accordingly affirmed the assessment of the
deficiency of $728,709.84. But it reversed the Board's
approval of the additional assessment of $364,354.92,
because of the following facts:
Before the deficiency assessment was made Mitchell
had been indicted in the federal court for southern New
York under § 146 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1928, which
provides:
"Any person... who willfully attempts in any mannet
to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the
payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned
for not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs
of prosecution."
The first count charged that Mitchell "unlawfully, wilfully, knowingly, feloniously, and fraudulently did attempt to defeat and evade an income tax of, to wit,
$728,709.84, upon his net income for 1929." He was tried
on the indictment and acquitted on all the counts. The
item of $728,709.84 set out in the first count is the same
item as that involved in the deficiency assessed; and
both arose from the same transactions of Mitchell. But
the addition of $364,354.92 by reason of fraud was not
involved in the indictment.
The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the prior judgment of acquittal was not a bar under the doctrine of
res judicata; and hence it affirmed the assessment of the
$728,709.84. But it-held that our decisions in Coffey v.
United States, 116 U. S. 436, and United States v. La
Franca,282 U. S. 568, required it "to treat the imposition
of the penalty of 50 per cent. as barred by the prior acquittal of Mitchell in the criminal action." 89 F. (2d)

ficiency of $728,709.84 was denied. 302 U. S. 723. The
Commissioner's petition to review so much of the judgment as denied the 50 per centum in addition was
granted, because of the importance in the administration
of the revenue laws of the questions presented and alleged conflict in decisions. 302 U. S. 670.
First. Mitchell contends that the claim for the 50 per,
cent. is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. He asserts that all the facts and intents requisite to the imposition of the 50 per centum addition to the deficiency
were put in issue and determined. against the Government in the criminal trial, and that hence, under the doctrine of res judicata the judgment of acquittal bars it
from obtaining a second judgment based upon the same
facts and intents. Since this proceeding to determine
whether the amount claimed is payable as a tax is a proceeding different in its nature from the indictment for
the crime of wilfully attempting to evade the tax, the
contention that the doctrine of estoppel by judgment applies rests wholly on the assertion that the issues here
presented were litigated and determined in the criminal
proceeding. Compare Tait v. Western Maryland Ry.
Co., 289 U. S. 620, 623. But this is not true.
The difference in degree of the burden of proof in
criminal and civil cases precludes application of the doctrine of res judicata. The acquittal was "merely . . .an
adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to overcome.
all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused." Lewis
v. Frick, 233 U. S. 291, 302. It did not determine that
Mitchell had not wilfully attempted to evade the tax.
.That acquittal on a criminal charge is not a bar to a civil
Action by the Government, remedial in-its nature, arising
out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding
was based has long been settled. Stone v. United States,
167 U. S. 178, 188; Murphy v. United States, 272 U. S.
630, 631, 632. Compare Chantangco v. Abaroa, 218 U. S.

476, 481, 482.' Where the objective of the subsequent
action likewise is punishment, the acquittal is a bar, because to entertain the second proceeding for punishment
would subject the defendant to double jeopardy; and
double jeopardy is precluded by the Fifth Amendment
whether the verdict was an acquittal or a conviction.
Murphy v. United States, 272 U. S. 630, 632.
The Government urges that application of the doctrine
of res judicata is precluded also by the difference in the
issues presented in the two cases; that although the indictment and this proceeding arise out of the same transactions and facts, the issues in them are not the same;
that on the indictment the issue was whether Mitchell
had "willfully" attempted to "evade or defeat" the tax;
that whether he had done so "fraudulently" was not there
an issue, United States v. Scharton, 285 U. S. 518; compare United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 397; and
that in this proceeding the issue is specifically whether
the deficiency was "due to fraud." Compare Burton v.
United States, 202 U. S. 344, 380. Since there was not
even an adjudication that Mitchell did not wilfully attempt to evade or defeat the tax, it is not necessary to
decide whether such an adjudication would be decisive
also of this issue of fraud. Compare Hanby v. Commissioner, 67 F. (2d) 125, 129.
Second. Mitchell contends that this proceeding is
barred under the doctrine of double jeopardy because the
50 per centum addition of $364,354.92 is not a tax, but a
criminal penalty intended as punishment for allegedly
fraudulent acts. Unless this sanction was intended as
punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal,
I United States v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 13 F. Supp. 614 (E.
D. Mo.), affirmed on other grounds, 298 U. S. 643; United States v.

Fed. 266, 268--69 (S. D. N. Y.)

HELVERING v. MITCHELL.
391

Opinion of the Court.

the double jeopardy clause provided for the defendant in
criminal prosecutions is not applicable.
1. In assessing income taxes the Government relies primarily upon the disclosure by the taxpayer of the relevant facts. This disclosure it requires him to make in his
annual return. To ensure full and honest disclosure, to
discourage fraudulent attempts to evade the tax, Congress imposes sanctions. Such sanctions may confessedly
be either criminal or civil. As stated in Oceanic Steam
Navigation Co. v. Stranahan,214 U. S. 320, 339:
"In accord with this settled judicial construction, the
legislation of Congress from the beginning, not only as to
tariff but as to internal revenue, taxation and other subjects, has proceeded on the conception that it was within
the competency of Congress, when legislating as to matters exclusively within its control, to impose appropriate
obligations and sanction their enforcement by reasonable
money penalties, giving to executive officers the power to
enforce such penalties without the necessity of invoking
the judicial power."
Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the double
jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the
same offense. The question for decision is thus whether
§ 293 (b) imposes a criminal sanction. That question is
one of statutory construction. Compare Murphy v.
United States, 272 U. S. 630, 632.
Remedial sanctions may be of varying types. One
which is characteristically free of the punitive criminal
element is revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted.2
Typical of this class of sanctions is the deportation of aliens.

Forfeiture of goods or their value and the payment of

have been recognized as enforcible by civil proceedings
since the original revenue law of 1789. Act of July 31,
1789, c. 5, § 36, 1 Stat. 29, 47. In spite of their comparative severity, such sanctions have been upheld against
the contention that they are essentially criminal and subject to the procedural rules governing criminal prosecutions. Passavantv. United States, 148 U. S. 214; United

' See also notes 7 to 13, infra. The distinction here taken between
sanctions that are remedial and those that are punitive has not
generally been specifically enunciated. In determining whether particular rules of criminal procedure are applicable to civil actions to
enforce sanctions, the cases have usually attempted to distinguish
between the type of procedural rule involved rather than the kind
of sanction being enforced. Thus Hepner v. United States, 213 U. S.
103, 111-112, holding that a verdict may be directed for the Government, and United States v. Regan, 232 U. S. 37, 50, holding
that the Government need not prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt, distinguished Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, and Lees
v. United States, 150 U. S. 476, holding that the defendant could
not be required to be a witness against himself on the eround that
"the guaranty in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution against
compulsory self-incrimination . . . is of broader scope than are the
guaranties in Article III and the Sixth Amendment governing trials
in criminal prosecutions." 232 U. S. aLt 50. Compare also Pierce v.
United States, 255 U. S. 398, 401.

HELVERING v. MITCHELL.
391

Opinion of the Court.

2. The remedial character of sanctions imposing additions to a tax has been made clear by this Court in passing upon similar legislation. They are provided primarily as a safeguard for the protection of the revenue
and to reimburse the Government for the heavy expense
of investigation and the loss resulting from the taxpayer's
fraud. In Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531,
547, 551, the Court said of a provision which added
double the value of the goods:
"It must therefore be considered as remedial, as providing. indemnity for loss. And it is not the less so because the liability of the wrongdoer is measured by double
the value of the goods received, concealed, or purchased,
instead of their single value. The act of abstracting goods
illegally imported, receiving, concealing or buying them,
interposes difficulties in the way of a government seizure, and impairs, therefore, the value of the government
right. It is, then, hardly accurate to say that the only
loss the government can sustain from concealing the
goods liable to seizure is their single value, or to assert
that the liability imposed by the statute of double the
value is arbitrary and without reference to indemnification. Double the value may not be more than complete indemnity ...
"The act of 1823 was, as wo have seen, remedial in its
nature. Its purpose was to secure full compensation for
interference with the rights of the United States ...

." '

3. In § 276 and 293 it is provided that collection of the
50 per centum addition, like that of the primary tax it4 Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 210; Bartlett v. Kane, 16

self, may be made "by distraint" as well as "by a proceeding in court." If the section provided a criminal
sanction, the provision for collection by distraint would

make it unconstitutional.'
259 U. S. 557; Regal Drug Corp. v. Wardell, 260 U. S.
386. See also United States v. Chouteau, 102 U. S. 603,

States, 150 U. S. 476; United States v. La Franca, 282
U. S. 568. That Congress provided a distinctly civil procedure for the collection of the additional 50 per centum
indicates clearly that it intended a civil, not a criminal,
sanction. Civil procedure is incompatible with the accepted rules and constitutional guaranties governing the
trial of criminal prosecutions, and where civil procedure
is prescribed for the enforcement of remedial sanctions,
those rules and guaranties do not apply. Thus the determination of the facts upon which liability is based may
be by an administrative agency instead of a jury,' or if
the prescribed proceeding is in the form of a civil suit,

6 Even

though Congress may not provide civil procedure for the
enforcement of punitive sanctions, nothing in the Constitution prevents the enforcement of distinctly. remedial sanctions by a criminal
instead of a civil form of proceeding. Compare United States v.
Stevenson, 215 U. S. 190, with United States v. Regan, 232 U. S.
37, both enforcing the sanction prescribed in 34 Stat. 898. The
fact that a criminal procedure is prescribed for the enforcement of
a sanction may be an indication that it is intended to be punitive,
but cannot be deemed conclusive if alternative enforcement by a
civil proceeding is sustained.

4. The fact that the Revenue Act of 1928 contains two
separate and distinct provisions imposing sanctions, and
that these appear in different parts of the statute, helps
to make clear the character of that here invoked.1 4 The

14 The Board of Tax Appeals said in Mitchell v. Commissioner,
32 B. T. A. 1093, 1136: "A careful study of the two sections convinces us that they are basically different in character and were
enacted for wholly different purposes. The language of the two sections differs widely and contemplates situations which may require
entirely dissimilar proof."

feat any [income] tax," introduccd into the Act under
the heading "Penalties," is obviously a criminal one.
The sanction of 50 per centum addition "if any part of
any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax,"
prescribed by § 293 (b), introduced into the Act under
the heading "Additions to the Tax," was clearly intended
as a civil one. This sanction, and other additions to the
tax, are set forth in Supplement M, entitled "Interest
and Additions to the Tax." The supplement includes,
besides § 293 (b), §§ 291, 292, 293 (a) and 294. Section 291 prescribes a 25 per centum addition for failure
to make and file a return; § 292 prescribes interest at
the rate of 6 per cent. per annum upon the deficiency
from the date prescribed for payment of the tax; § 293
(a), an addition of 5 per centum if the deficiency "is
due to negligence, or intentional disregard of rules and
regulations but without intent to defraud"; and § 294
prescribes an addition to the tax of 1 per centum per
month in case of non-payment. Obviously all of these
"Additions to the Tax" were intended by Congress as
civil incidents of the assessment and collection of- the
income tax.'
Third. Mitchell insists that Coffey v. United States,
116 U. S.436, requires affirmance. of the judginent; Ihe
Government argues that this case is distinguishable, and,
if not, that it should be disapproved. The Circuit Court
of Appeals, citing Stone v. United States, 167 U. S. 178,
186-189, and later cases, recognized that the rule of the
Coffey case "did not apply to a situation where there
had been an acquittal on a criminal charge followed by
a civil action requiring a different degree of proof"; but
.'-Section 104 imposes a somewhat similar additional tax of 50
per cent. of the net income in the case of corporations formed or
availed of for the purpose of avoiding surtax on their shareholders
through improper accumulation of surplus. Compare United Bvsiness
Corp. v. Commissioner, 62 F. (2d) 754 (C. C. A. 2).

construing § 293 (b) as imposing a penalty designed to
punish fraudulent tax dodgers "and not as a mere preventive measure," it thought that the Coffey case and
United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568, required it
"to treat the imposition of the penalty of 50 per cent.
as barred by the prior acquittal of Mitchell in the criminal action." Since we construe § 293 (b) as imposing a
civil administrative sanction, neither case presents an
obstacle to the recovery of the $364,354.92, the 50 per
centum addition here in issue.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 374. Argued February 2, 3,1938.-Decided March 7,1938.
1. As an incident to the right to recover the amount of a bank
deposit, the depositor is entitled to interest as damages for the
failure to pay upon demand. P. 410.
2. The obligation of a national bank to pay interest as damages for
detention of a. debt is not cut off by suspension of its business and
appointment of a receiver. P. 410.
3. The rule that in pro rata distribution, to creditors of an insolvent
national bank, interest on claims is limited to interest accrued
prior to insolvency, does not apply to the claim of a secured creditor against the assets covered by his lien. The secured creditor
may enforce his lien against his security to satisfy both principal
aind interest. P. 411.
