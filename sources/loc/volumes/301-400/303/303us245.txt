McCOLLUM v. HAMILTON NAT. BANK. 245
Opinion of the Court.

McCOLLUM, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY, v.
HAMILTON NATIONAL BANK.
CERTIORARI

No. 342.

TO THE

SUPREME

COURT OF TENNESSEE.

Argued January 31, 1938.-Decided February 28, 193S.

Rev. Stats. § 5197 governs the rates of interest chargeable by national banks, and § 5198 provides that, if a greater rate has
been paid, the person paying it, or his legal representative, may
recover twice the amount from the bank. Where the person entitled became bankrupt and the action against the bank was
by his trustee in bankruptcy, the state court first granted judgment for double the usurious interest, but set off the judgment
against the bankrupt's indebtedness to the bank. Held:
1. Although the form of action prescribed is debt, the cause
of action is ex delicto and the recovery punitive; no set-off is
permissible in the proceeding, either before or after judgment.
P. 247.
2. Punishment for usury does not depend upon payment of the
borrower's debt. P. 249.
Reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

303 U. S.

§ 5198 2 declares that the receiving of a rate of interest
greater than that allowed, when knowingly done, shall
be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest and provides that, in case a greater rate has been paid, the person paying it may recover back twice the amount, in a
suit in the nature of an action of debt. Petitioner is
trustee in bankruptcy of Lookout Planing Mills, a corporation. He brought this suit under § 5198 in the
chancery court of Hamilton County, Tennessee, to recover from respondent the penalty imposed by that section. Respondent answered denying liability, and by
cross-bill alleged the bankrupt owed it $25,493.70 on
notes, and prayed that it be allowed to set off its claim
against any judgment that petitioner might obtain.
Petitioner's answer to the cross-bill asserted that recovery of the penalty did not depend on payment of the
debt.
The chancellor found that the bankrupt paid and respondent knowingly received $5,235.55 as interest based
on a rate in excess of that permitted and gave him judginent for double that amount. He ruled that after judgment petitioner's claim was subject to set-off and ordered
that the amount awarded him be applied as a credit
upon the debt. The state supreme court held the setoff permissible under the Bankruptcy Act, § 68 (a), and
expressly authorized by § 8769 of the Tennessee Code and
'12 U. S. C., § 86: "The taking, receiving, reserving, or charging
a rate of interest greater than is allowed by the preceding section,
when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it,
or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. In case the greater
rate of interest has been paid, the person by whom it has been paid,
or his legal representatives, may recover back, in an action in the
nature of an action of debt, twice the amount of the interest thus
paid from the association taking or receiving the same: Provided,
That such action is commenced within two years from the time the
usurious transaction occurred."

McCOLLUM v. HAMILTON NAT. BANK. 247
245

Opinion of the Court.

declared that petitioner would be required to do equity
by having his claim credited on the larger one owing to
the respondent by the bankrupt.
The question is whether respondent is entitled to have
the amount of the judgment for penalty credited on its
claim against the bankrupt estate.
When the bank knowingly received illegal interest, it
immediately became liable for, and the borrower became
entitled to recover from it, a penalty of twice the amount
of the interest thus paid. Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29. Lake Benton First
National Bank v. Watt, 184 U. S. 151. Upon petitioner's
appointment as trustee in bankruptcy, the bankrupt's
right to recover the penalty vested in him. Bankruptcy
Act, § 70 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 110 (a). First National Bank
v. Lasater, 196 U. S. 115, 118. Reed v. American-German Nat. Bank, 155 Fed. 233. The penalty is to be enforced according to the terms of the statute. Guilt being established, the law itself fixes the punishment at precisely twice the usurious exaction paid; it may not be
enhanced or mitigated because of aggravating circumstances or equitable considerations. As the sum demanded is certain, recovery in an action of debt is authorized, though the claim arises not in contract but in
tort. Chaffee & Co. v, United States, 18 Wall. 516, 538.
The liability can only be enforced in an action "brought
specially and exclusively for that purpose,-where the
sole issue is the guilt or innocence of the accused, without
the presence of any extraneous facts which might confuse
the case." Barnet v. National Bank, 98 U. S. 555, 559.
One paying a national bank usurious interest and entitled to enforce the penalty may not recover it by way
of set-off in a suit brought upon his note to the bank.

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

:303 U. S.

See Schuyler National Bank v. Gadsden, 191 U. S. 451,
456.
Reasons, at least as cogent as those that uphold that
rule, support the contention that the state court erred
in permitting respondent to credit the amount of petitioner's judgment for penalty upon the notes given it by
the bankrupt. To allow respondent to satisfy the judgment for penalty by mere deduction from its claim
against the bankrupt's estate is to detract from the punishment definitely prescribed. The sentence specifically
required by the law may not be cut down by implication,
set-off or construction; for that would narrow the statute
and tend to defeat its purpose. See United States v.
Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95. Fasulo v. United States,
272 U. S. 620, 628.
The right of set-off here involved does not at all depend upon the Tennessee statute upon which, at least
in part, the state supreme court rested its ruling. Sections 5197 and 5198, Revised Statutes, define petitioner's
right to recover, and respondent's liability for, the penalty; the Bankruptcy Act governs liquidation and distribution of the bankrupt's estate. It results that the validity of the challenged provision of the decree depends upon
the right of set-off in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Act, § 68
(a), 11 U. S. C. § 108 (a). Cf. Yates v. Jones National
Bank, 206 U. S. 158, 179. Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing,supra. McDaniel National Bank
v. Bridwell, 74 F. (2d) 331.
Section 68 (a) declares: "In all cases of mutual debts
or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and
a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall
be set off against the other, and the balance only shall
be allowed and paid." The words "debts" and "credits"
as there used are correlative. What is a debt on one
side is a credit on the other. Libby v. Hopkins, 104 U. S.

McCOLLUM v. HAMILTON NAT. BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

303, 309. Liability for the penalty does not arise in contract but is laid in inviturn as a disciplinary measure.
Nor does the judgment determining the extent of guilt
and declaring sentence change the liability for penalty
to one for debt. Chase v. Curtis, 113 U. S. 452, 463-464.
Boynton v. Hall, 121 U. S. 457, 465-466.
As the penalty may be enforced only in a suit brought
exclusively for that purpose so that the trial of guilt or
innocence may not be embarrassed by any other question,
it is plain that the payment of any debt owed by the
plaintiff to the bank may not be held a condition precedent to the determination of that issue. Punishment
for usury'does not depend upon payment of the borrower's debt. It follows that respondent is not entitled to
satisfy petitioner's judgment by deducting the amount
of it from respondent's claim against the bankrupt's estate. Meredith v. American National Bank, 127 Tenn.
90, 94; 153 S. W. 479. Exeter National Bank v. Orchard,
43 Neb. 579, 582; 61 N. W. 833. Morehouse v. Second
National Bank, 30 Iun 628. Reason, well supported by
authority, requires that the penalty for usury so specifically prescribed shall be paid according to the terms of
the statute.
Reversed.
