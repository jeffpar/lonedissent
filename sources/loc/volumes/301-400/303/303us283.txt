CERTIORARI

No. 274.

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

Submitted January 10, 1938.-Decided February 28, 1938.

1. There is a strong presumption that the plaintiff in a state court
has not claimed a large amount in order to confer jurisdiction
by removal on a federal court, and that the parties have not
colluded to that end. P. 290.
2. The status of the case as disclosed by the plaintiff's complaint
is controlling in the case of a removal, since the defendant must
file his petition before the time for answer or forever lose his
right to remove. P. 291.
3. Jurisdiction of the District Court acquired through removal is
not lost by plaintiff's subsequent reduction of his claim to less
than the jurisdictional amount. P. 292.
90 F. 2d 229, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 302 U. S. 669, to review a judgment dis-

missing an appeal from a judgment recovered in an action
on a contract of insurance. The action had been removed
from a state court. The respondent here conceded that
the ruling below was erroneous and prayed that the cause
be remanded for decision of the merits.
Mr. Burke G. Slaymaker submitted on brief for petitioner.

Mr. William E. Reiley submitted for respondent.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS

303 U. S.

delivered the opinioli of the

Court.
The decision under review is that, although, at the time
of removal of a cause from a state court, the complaint
disclosed an amount in controversy requisite to the federal court's jurisdiction, a subsequent amendment, reducing the sum claimed to substantially less than that
amount, necessitates remand to the state court. We
granted the writ of certiorari because of alleged conflict
with our decisions and with those of other federal
courts.
The respondent, a corporation of Indiana, issued a
summons out of the Superior Court of Marion County,
Indiana, against the petitioner, a Minnesota corporation
doing business in Indiana, and one Harlan as its agent.
The complaint alleged that the respondent was subject to
the provisions of the Indiana Workmen's Compensation
Act and had entered into a contract of insurance with the
petitioner, evidenced by a binder, whereby the petitioner
insured the respondent against loss or expense by reason
of claims for compensation for a period of thirty days
from December 30, 1933, and agreed to act for the respondent in the filing of reports and notices under the
Act; that, during the term of the insurance, employes of
the respondent had suffered injury in the course of employment and made claims therefor; that the petitioner
had been notified of each injury and investigated it in
connection with the claim for compensation; that after
the expiration of the contract the petitioner notified the
respondent that it would not recognize any of the claims
and denied liability under the binder; that as a consequence respondent was compelled to employ attorneys,
investigators, and medical assistants to investigate and
satisfy claims covered by the contract and to pay employes
who had suffered injuries during the contract period, and

to pay, or obligate itself to pay, for medical, hospital,
or dental bills in connection with such injuries; to the
damage of the respondent in the sum of $4,000. It was
alleged that the petitioner had acted, in making the contract, through Harlan, its authorized agent and representative, and an order was prayed that Harlan retain
all moneys due by him to the petitioner for the purpose
of answering any judgment which might be recovered.
The complaint concluded by demanding $4,000 and other
appropriate relief. Upon the petitioner's timely application the cause was removed to the United States District
Court for Southern Indiana. The respondent thereafter
filed an amended complaint, the substance of which is
not now material, and later a "second amended complaint
for breach of contract and for damages," in which the
allegations of the original complaint were repeated and
damages were claimed in the sum'of $4,000. An exhibit
was attached which gave the names of the employes and
the amounts expended in connection with their asserted
injuries totaling $1,380.89. The court dismissed Harlan
as a defendant, transferred the cause to the law docket,
and overruled a demurrer to the complaint as not stating
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The answer denied the making of the contract. A jury trial
was waived and the court made findings, stated its conclusions, and entered judgment for the respondent for
$1,162.98. The petitioner appealed. The Court of Appeals refused to decide the merits on the ground that as
the record showed respondent's claim did not equal the
amoqnt necessary to give the District Court jurisdiction, the case should have been remanded to the state
court.1

United States is § 24 of the Judicial Code.-' So far as
here material, the Code confers jurisdiction of a suit of
a civil nature, where the matter in controversy exceeds,
exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000
and is between citizens of different states.
Authority for removal of certain causes from a state to
,a federal court was first given by § 12 of the Judiciary Act
of 1789 " which permitted removal of a civil suit, instituted by a citizen of the state in which the suit was
brought, against a citizen of another state, where the
matter in dispute exceeded the sum or value of $500, exclusive of costs. Such removal could be had only at the
instance of the nonresident defendant. The Act of July
27, 1866,1 enlarged the privilege of removal by providing that if, in such a civil suit, it was shown that a nonresident defendant was party to a separable controversy,
which could be determined without the presence of other
defendants, that defendant might remove the cause.
The Judiciary Act of 1875 ' altered prexisting law to
permit suits involving a controversy between citizens of
different states to be removed by either party. The Judiciary Acts of 1887-1888 increased the jurisdictional
amount to more than $2,000, exclusive of interest and
costs, and confined the right of removal to a nonresident
defendant, and the Judicial Code increased the limit to
over $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and also restricted the privilege to nonresident defendants..7 The

statute governing dismissal or remand for want of jurisdiction is § 37 of the Code.8
"If in "any suit commenced in a district court, or removed from a State court to a district court of the United
States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought
or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and
substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly
within the jurisdiction of said district court, or that the
parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively
made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the
purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under
this chapter, the said district court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to
the court from which it was removed, as justice may require, and shall make such order as to costs as shall be
just.
This provision first appeared as § 5' of the Act of
March 3, 1875 (supra), and save for the elision of a concluding clause, and the substitution of "district court" for
"circuit court," is identical with that section. It was
included in the Judiciary Acts of 1887-1888, supra, and
has been continuously in force since 1875. It altered the
practice by requiring the court to dismiss or remand of
its own motion in a proper case although want of jurisdiction was not raised by appropriate motion or by plea
or answer,' ° but did not change the substantial basis for

the court's action. The principles governing dismissal
of a cause initiated in the federal court or the remand of
one begun in a state court have remained as they were
before the section was adopted.
The intent of Congress drastically to restrict federal
jurisdiction in controversies between citizens of different
states has always been rigorously enforced by the courts.
The rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in
cases brought in the federal court is that, unless the law
gives a different rule, the sum claimed by the plaintiff

Opinion of the Court.

It must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really
for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.' The inability of plaintiff to recover an amount
adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his
bad faith or oust the jurisdiction.14 Nor does the fact
that the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense to the claim. 5 But if, from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, that the plaintiff
cannot recover the amount claimed, or if, from the proofs,
the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff
never was entitled to recover that amount, and that his
claim was therefore colorable for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, the suit will-be dismissed."6 Events oc13 Barry v. Edmunds, supra; Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U. S. 115,

curring subsequent to the institution of suit which reduce
the amount recoverable below the statutory limit do not
oust jurisdiction."
What already has been said, and circumstances later
to be discussed, lead to the conclusion that a dismissal
would not have been justified had the suit been brought
in the federal court. The principles which govern remand of a removed cause, more urgently require that it
should not have been remanded. In a cause instituted in
the federal court the plaintiff chooses his forum. He
knows or should know whether his claim is within the
statutory requirement as to amount. His good faith in
choosing the federal forum is open to challenge not only
by resort to the face of his complaint, but by the facts disclosed at trial, and if from either source it is clear that
his claim never could have amounted to the sum necessary to give jurisdiction there is no injustice in dismissing
the suit. Indeed, this is the court's duty under the Act
of 1875. In such original actions it may also well be that
plaintiff and defendant have colluded to confer jurisdiction by the method of the one claiming a fictitious
amount and the other failing to deny the veracity of the
averment of amount in controversy. Upon disclosure of
that state of facts the court should dismiss.
A different situation is presented in the case of a suit
instituted in a state court and thence removed. There
is a strong presumption that the plaintiff has not claimed
a large amount in order to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.or that the parties have colluded to that end. 8

Opinion of the Court.

For if such were the purpose suit would not have been
instituted in the first instance in the state but in the

federal court. It is highly unlikly that the parties would

pursue this roundabout and troublesome method to get
into the federal court by removal when by the same device the suit could be instituted in that court.

complaint is controlling in the case of a removal, since
the defendant must file his petition before the time for
answer or forever lose his right to remove."0

Of course,

diversity of citizenship, as the pleadings raised a federal qucstion, the
cause was removed. It was remanded as the circuit court thought
there was no federal question involved. The decision was reversed.
Speaking of the facts disclosed the court said: "There is a ground
for remanding the cause suggested by the record, but not sufficiently
apparent to justify us in resorting to it to support the action of the
circuit court. The value of the property taken is stated in the declaration to be but $100, although the damages for the alleged trespass
are laid at $6,000 ....
We cannot, of course, assume as a matter
of law, that the amount laid, or a less amount, greater than $500, is
not recoverable upon the case stated in the declaration, and cannot
therefore justify the order remanding the cause, on the ground that
the matter in dispute does not exceed the sum or value of $500. But
if the circuit court had found, as matter of fact, that the amount of
damages stated in the declaration was colorable, and had been laid
beyond the amount of a reasonable expectation of recovery, for the
purpose of creating a case removable under the act of Congress, so
that, in the words of the 5th section of the act of 1875, it appeared
that the suit 'did not really and substantially involve a dispute or
controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court,' the
order remanding it to the State court could have been sustained."
This appears to be the only reported case of a removal by the plaintiff as authorized by the Act of 1875, and is distinguishable on that
ground, as respects the possibility that plaintiff's claim 'may have
been colorable Sor the purpose of removing the case.

if, upon the face of the complaint, it is obvious that the
suit cannot involve the necessary amount, removal will
be futile and remand will follow." But the fact that it
appears from the face of the complaint that the defendant has a valid defense, if asserted, to all or a portion of
the claim, or the circumstance that the rulings of the district court after removal reduce the amount recoverable
below the jurisdictional requirement,2 2 will not justify
remand. And though, as here, the plaintiff after removal,
by stipulation, by affidavit,, or by amendment of his
pleadings, reduces the claim below the requisite amount,
this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.2"

Opinion of the Court.

Thus events occurring subsequent to removal which reduce the amount recoverable, whether beyond the plaintiff's control or the result of his volition, do not oust the
district court's jurisdiction once it has attached." This
is well illustrated by Kirby v. American Soda Fountain
Co., 194 IT S. 141, 146, where in a suit brought by Kirby
he alleged that lie was induced by the company's false
representations to agree to the exchange of his apparatus
for one made by the defendant and to pay $2025 in addition. He prayed the cancellation of his obligation to
pay the balance of $2025, damages of $2500, and general
relief. The cause was removed to the circuit court. The
company answered denying Kirby's charges of fraud, relied upon a wtitten agreement alleged to contain all the
terms of the contract, asserted full performance on its
part, and that he had paid Out $325 on his obligation to
pay $2025. By cross-complaint, the company demanded
$1700 and interest from Kirby and the establishment of
a lien on the apparatus delivered to him. Kirby answered
that he had voluntarily dismissed the original suit brought
by him and that the cross-bill was not within the jurisdiction of the court because it did not claim in excess of
$2,000, exclusive of interest and costs. The plea was
overruled and judgment rendered on the cross-complaint.
In affirming, the court referred to the amount demanded
in Kirby's original complaint and said: "The matter in
dispute having thus been -made to exceed the sum or value
of two thousand 'dollars, exclusive of interest and costs,
defendant presented his petition and bond for removal,
justified by the conviction that the defendant when it removed
knew that the amount involved w:as too little to give jurisdiction:
Turmine v. West Jersey & S. R. Co., 44 F. (2d) 614; American
Stores Co. v. Gerlach, 55 F. (2d) 658.
24 The same principle applies in cases where a fixed amount is
requisite to jurisdiction on appeal. Lee "v. Watson, 1 Wall. 337;
Cooke v. United States, 2 Wall. 218.

303 U. S.

and the cause was thereupon removed. The jurisdiction
thus acquired by the Circuit Court was not divested by
plaintiff's subsequent action."
Fifty years earlier in Kanouse v. Martin, 15 How. 198,
the court had held that voluntary reduction of the amount
demanded below the sum necessary to give the circuit
court jurisdiction could not defeat that jurisdiction once
removal proceedings had been perfected. In reliance
upon these precedents many cases, cited in Note 23, have
been decided.
We think this well established rule is supported by
ample reason. If the plaintiff could, no matter how bona
fide his original claim in the state court, reduce the
amount of his demand to defeat federal jurisdiction'
the defendant's supposed statutory right of removal
would be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. The claim,
whether well or ill founded in fact, fixes the right of the
defendant to remove, and the plaintiff ought not to be
able io defeat that right and bring the cause back to the
state court at his election. If he does not desire to try
his case in the federal court he may resort to the expedient of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and
though he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant
cannot remove. 5
This view is further supported by the authorities as
to causes in which jurisdiction depends on diversity of
citizenship. It uniformly has been held that in a suit
properly begun in the federal court the change of citizenship of a party does not oust the jurisdiction." The same

an amendment in the state court reducing the claim below the

Opinion of the Court.

rule governs a suit originally brought in a state court and
removed to a federal court. 7
The decisions as to remand of a cause removed because it involves a separable controversy are not inconsistent with those concerning remand for lack of jurisdictional amount. In the case of a separable controversy,
if, after removal, the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses
as to the defendant who removed, so that there no longer
exists any separable controversy, the cause must be remanded.2" If a cause be removed on this ground the
whole case, including the controversy between citizens of
the same state, is taken over by the federal court only
because one or more of the defendants is entitled to invoke its jurisdiction. The basis of federal jurisdiction
failing, it is proper that the remaining parties, who were
involuntarily taken into the federal court, should, upon
the cessation of the separable controversy which was the
cause of their transmission to another tribunal, have their
case returned to the state court.
The present case well illustrates the propriety of the
rule that subsequent reduction of the amount claimed
cannot oust the district court's jurisdiction. Suit was instituted in the state court June 5, 1934. The lump sum
claimed was largely in excess of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. The items which went to make up the
respondent's demand for indemnity were numerous and

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

303 U. S.

each, in turn, was itself the total of several items of expenditure or liability. There is nothing to indicate that
all of the sums for which reimbursement was claimed had
actually been expended prior to the beginning of suit or
that the sums thereafter to be expended had been ascertained. Not until the second amended complaint was
filed in the United States court, in November 1934, did
the respondent furnish a statement of the particulars of
its claim. That statement, is not inconsistent with the
making of a claim in good faith for over $3,000 when the
suit was instituted. Nor is there evidence that the petitioner when it removed the cause knew, or had reason to
believe, that the respondent's claim, whether well or ill
founded in law or fact, involved less than $3,000. On the
face of the pleadings petitioner was entitled to invoke
the jurisdiction of the federal court, and a reduction of
fhe amount claimed, after removal, did not take away
that privilege.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings
in conformity to this opinion.
Reversed.
