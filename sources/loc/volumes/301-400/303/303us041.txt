v. BETHLEHEM SHIPBUILDING
CORP.*

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 181.

Argued January 5, 1938.-Decided January 31, 1938.

1. The National Labor Relations Board, upon a charge made to it,
issued a complaint against a corporation engaged, at the plant
involved, in the building and sale of ships, boats and marine
equipment. The complaint alleged that the corporation dominated and interfered, in a manner described, with a labor organization of its employees, and was thus engaged in unfair labor
practices affecting commerce within the meaning of the National
Labor Relations Act of July 5, 1935. The corporation was given
notice of a hearing to be had upon the complaint. Held:
(1) That the District Court had no jurisdiction of a suit by the

corpdration to enjoin the Board from holding the hearing. P. 47.
*Together with No. 182, Myers et al. v. MacKenzie et al., also

Circuit.

The bill alleged that the business of the company at the plant
affected, and the sale of its products, were not in interstate or
foreign commerce; that the holding of the hearings would be
futile and would irreparably damage the company, by expense and
inconvenience, impairment of the good will and harmonious relations existing between it and its employees, and lowered efficiency
of its operations.
(2) That the District Court had no jurisdiction of a suit by
employees of the corporation who were officers of a labor organization at the plant, to enjoin the Board from holding the hearing,the bill in this case alleging further that the employees are satisfied
with their existing contracts of employment and desire to retain the
existing plan of representation without change; that the holding of
the proposed hearing will discredit the plan and destroy its usefulness to the employees; that they will be deprived of their right to
negotiate by the method of their choice, the value of which has been
proved by years of operation; that alteration of the plan will
cause dissatisfaction among the employees; that operation of plant
will be disrupted by labor disturbances; that employment will be
interrupted; and that the damage to the employees will be irreparable. P. 53.
2. In the National Labor Relations Act, Congress provided for appropriate procedure before the Labor Board and an adequate opportunity, through review by the Circuit Court of Appeals, to
secure judicial protection against possible illegal action by the
Board; and the grant to the Board and the Circuit Court of
Appeals of exclusive jurisdiction "to prevent any person from
engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce" is
constitutional. P. 48.
3. The conclusion that the District Court is without jurisdiction to
enjoin the holding of a hearing by the Labor Board, even though
it be claimed that interstate or foreign commerce is not involved
and that the holding of a hearing would cause irreparable injury,
does not deny any rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. P. 50.
4. The rule requiring exhaustion of the administrative remedy can
not be circumvented by a claim that the charge on which the complaint rests is groundless and that the mere holding of the prescribed administrative hearing would result in irreparable damage. P. 51.
5. The general rule that the decree of a District Court granting or
denying a preliminary injunction will not be disturbed on appeal,

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The question for decision is whether a federal district
court has equity jurisdiction to enjoin the National Labor'
Relations Board from holding a hearing upon a complaint
filed by it against an employer alleged to be engaged in
unfair labor practices prohibited by. National Labor Relations Act, July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held in these
cases that the District Court possesses such'yurisdiction;
and granted preliminary injunctions. Every other Circuit Court of Appeals in which the question has arisen has

held the contrary.1 Because of the importance of the
questions presented, the conflict in the lower courts and
alleged conflict with our own decisions, we granted these
writs of certiorari.
The declared purpose of the National Labor Relations
Act is to diminish the causes of labor disputes burdening
and obstructing interstate and foreign commerce; and its
provisions are applicable only to such commerce. In
order to protect it the Act seeks to promote collective
bargaining; confers upon employees engaged in such
commerce the right to form, and join in, labor organizations; defines acts of an employer which shall be deemed
unfair labor practice; and confers upon the Board certain limited powers with a view to preventing such practices. If a charge is made to the Board that a person
"has engaged in or is engaging in any . . . unfair labor
practice," and it appears that a proceeding in respect
thereto should be instituted, a complaint stating the
charge is to be filed, and a hearing is to be held thereon
upon notice to the person complained of.
The Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding
Workers of America, Local No. 5, made to the Board a
charge that the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation,
Ltd.,' was engaging in unfair labor practices at its plant
in Quincy, Massachusetts, for the production, sale and

distribution of boats, ships, and marine equipment. Upon that charge the Board filed, on April 13, 1936, a
complaint which alleged, among other things, that the
company dominates and interferes in the manner described "with a labor organization known as Plan of Representation of Employees in Plants of the Bethlehem
Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd."; that .such action leads
to strikes interfering with interstate commerce; and that
"the aforesaid acts of respondent constitute unfair labor
practices affecting commerce, within the meaning of Section 8, subdivisions (1) and (2) and Section 2, subdivisions (6) and (7) of said [National Labor Relations]
Act."
The complaint alleged, specifically:
"The respondent in the course and conduct of its
business causes and has continuously caused large quantities of the raw materials used in the production of its
boats, ships and marine equipment to be purchased and
transported in interstate commerce from and through
states of the United States other than the State of
Massachusetts to the Fore River Plant in the State of
Massachusetts, and causes and has continuously caused
the boats, ships and marine equipment produced by it
to be sold and transported in interstate commerce from
the Fore River Plant in the State of Massachusetts to,
into and through states of the United States other than
the State of Massachusetts, all of the aforesaid constituting a continuous flow of trade, traffic and commerce
among the several states."
The Board duly notified the Corporation that a hearing on the complaint would be held on April 27, 1936,
at Boston, Massachusetts, in accordance with Rules and
Regulations of the Board, a copy of which was annexed
to the notice; and that the Corporation "will have the
right to appear, in person or otherwise, and give testimony."

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

303 U. S

On that day the Corporation filed, in the federal court
for Massachusetts, the bill in equity, herein numbered
181, against A. Howard Myers, Acting Regional Director
for the First Region, National Labor Relations Board,
Edmund J. Blake, its Regional Attorney for the First
Region, and Daniel M. Lyons, Trial Examiner, to enjoin
them from holding "a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the plaintiff has engaged at its
Fore River Plant in any so-called unfair labor practices
under the National Labor Relations Act, and from having
any proceedings or taking any action whatsoever, at any
time or times, with respect thereto." There were prayers for a restraining order, an interlocutory injunction and
a permanent injunction; and, also, a prayer that the
court declare that the National Labor Relations Act and
"defendants' actions and proposed actions thereunder"
violate the Federal Constitution.
On May 4, 1936, another bill in equity, herein numbered 182, against the same defendants, seeking, on
largely the same allegations of fact, substantially the
same relief, was brought in the same court by Charles
MacKenzie, James E. Manning and Thomas E. Barker,
employees of the Bethlehem Corporation and officers of
the so-called Plan of Representation at the Fore River
Plant.'
Upon the filing of each bill, the District Court issued a
restraining order and an order of notice to show cause
why a preliminary injunction should not issue. In each
case the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the bill of
complaint and also a return to the order to show cause.
The cases were heard together. In each, the District
Court issued the preliminary injunction; and the decrees
therefor are still in effect. They were affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on Febru3

Opinion of the Court.

ary 12, 1937. 88 F. (2d) 154. Petitions for a rehearing,
based upon the conflict with the decisions of other circuit courts of appeals were denied. And the court denied
also motions for leave to file a second petition for rehearing, based upon the decisions of this Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., 301 U. S. 1, and other cases rendered April 12,
1937. 89 F. (2d) 1000. The District Court denied the
motions to dismiss the bills. 15 F. Supp. 915. But the
review by the Circuit Court of Appeals dealt only with
the decrees for a preliminary injunction.
The two cases present, in the main, the same questions.
In discussing them reference will be made, in the first
instance, only to the suit brought by the Corporation.
We are of opinion that the District Court was without
power to enjoin the Board from holding the hearings.
First. There is no claim by the Corporation that the
statutory provisions and the rules of procedure prescribed
for such hearings are illegal; or that the Corporation was
not accorded ample opportunity to answer the complaint
of the Board; or that opportunity to introduce evidence
on the allegations made will be denied. The claim is that
the provisions of the Act are not applicable to the Corporation's business at the Fore River Plant, because the
operations conducted there are not carried on, and the
products manufactured are not sold, in interstate or foreign commerce; that, therefore, the Corporation's rela-,
tions with its employees at the plant cannot burden or
interfere with such commerce; that hearings would, at
best, be futile; and that the holding of them would result in irreparable damage to the Corporation, not only by
reason of their direct cost and the loss of time of its
officials and employees, but also because the hearings
would cause serious impairment of the good will and
harmonious relations existing between the Corporation

OCTOBER TERM, 1937.
Opinion of the Court.

303 U. S.

and its employees, and thus seriously impair the efficiency
of its operations.4
Second. The District Court is without jurisdiction to
enjoin hearings because the power "to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair practice affecting commerce," has been vested by Congress in the Board and the
Circuit Court of Appeals, and Congress has declared:
"This power shall be exclusive, and shall not be affected by
any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been
or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise." I The grant of that exclusive power is constitutional, because the Act provided for appropriate procedure before the Board and in the review by the Circuit
Court of Appeals an adequate opportunity to secure
judicial protection against possible illegal action on the
part of the Board. No power to enforce an order is conferred upon the Board. To secure enforcement, the Board
must apply to a Circuit Court of Appeals for its affirmance. And until the Board's order has been affirmed by
the appropriate Circuit Court of Appeals, no penalty accrues for disobeying it. The independent right to apply
to a Circuit Court of Appeals to have an order set aside
' It is alleged that in 1934 and 1935 the predecessor of the present
National Labor Relations Board instituted somewhat similar action
against the Corporation. Although the proceedings were eventually
dismissed, the hearings consumed a total of some 2500 hours of
working time of officials and employees and cost the Corporation
more than $15,000, none of which could be recovered.
Compare House Committee Report, H. R. Rep. 1147, 74th Cong.,
1st Sess., p. 24: "any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board
granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may claim
a review of such order in the appropriate circuit court of appeals,
or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. It is intended here to give the party aggrieved a full, expeditious, and exclusive method of review in one proceeding after a final order is
made. Until such final order is made the party is not injured, and
cannot be heard to complain, as has been held in cases under the
Federal Trade Commission Act."

MYERS v. BETHLEHEM CORP.
Opinion of the Court.

is conferred upon any party aggrieved by the proceeding
before the Board. The Board is even without power to
enforce obedience to its subpoena to testify or to produce
written evidence. To enforce obedience it must apply to
a District Court; and to such an application appropriate
defence may be made.'
As was said in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones
& Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 46, 47, the procedural
provisions,
"do not offend against the constitutional requirements
governing the creation and action of administrative bodies.
See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville &
Nashville R. Co., 227 U. S. 88, 91. The Act establishes
standards to which the Board must conform. There must
be complaint, notice and hearing. The Board must
receive evidence and make findings. The findings as to
the facts are to be conclusive, but only if supported by
evidence. The order of the Board is subject to review by
the designated court, and only when sustained by the
court may the order be enforced. Upon that review all
questions of the jurisdiction of the Board and the regularity of its proceedings, all questions of constitutional
right or statutory authority, are open to examination by
the court. We construe the procedural provisions as
affording adequate opportunity to secure judicial protection against arbitrary action in accordance with the wellsettled rules applicable to administrative agencies set up
by Congress to aid in the enforcement of valid legislation."
It is true that the Board has jurisdiction only if the
complaint concerns interstate or foreign commerce. Unless
the Board finds that it does, the complaint must be dismissed. And if it finds that interstate or foreign commerce
'See § 11 of the Act and Article II, §§ 20 and 21, of the Rules
and Regulations issued April 27, 1936. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Claire Furnace Co., 274 U. S. 160; E. I. Dupont de Nemours
& Co. v. Boland, 85 F. (2d) 12 (C C. A. 2).

is involved, but the Circuit Court of Appeals concludes
that such finding was without adequate evidence to support it, or otherwise contrary to law, the Board's petition
to enforce it will be dismissed, or the employer's petition
to have it set aside will be granted. 7 Since the procedure
before the Board is appropriate and the judicial review
so provided is adequate, Congress had power to vest
exclusive jurisdiction in the Board and the Circuit Court
of Appeals. Anniston Manufacturing Co. v. Davis, 301
U. S. 337, 343-346.
Third. The Corporation contends that, since it denies
that interstate or foreign commerce is involved and claims
that a hearing would subject it to irreparable damage,
rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution will be
denied unless it be held that the District Court has jurisdiction to enjoin the holding of a hearing by the Board.'
So to hold would, as the Government insists, in effect substitute the District Court for the Board as the tribunal to
hear and determine what Congress declared the Board
exclusively should hear and determine in the first instance.
The contention is at war with the long settled rule of
judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial
relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre'Section 10 (f) of the Act provides: "Upon such filing, the court
shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application
by the Board under subsection (e), and shall have the same exclusive jurisdiction to grant to the Board such temporary relief or
restraining order as it deems just and proper, and in like manner
to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as
so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the
Board; and the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by
evidence, shall in like manner be conclusive."
' In support of that contention the following cases were cited: Ohio
Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S. 287, 289; Bluefield
Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 262 U. S. 679, 683; Phillipsv. Commis.

scribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.' That
rule has been repeatedly acted on in cases where, as here,
the contention is made that the administrative body
lacked power over the subject matter. °
Obviously, the rule requiring exhaustion of the administrative remedy cannot be circumvented by asserting that the charge on which the complaint rests is
groundless and that the mere holding of the prescribed
administrative hearing would result in irreparable damage." Lawsuits also often prove to have been groundThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity where relief
by injunction was sought. Pittsburgh &c. Ry. v. Board of Public
Works, 172 U. S. 32, 44-45; Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211
U. S. 210, 230; Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation

applicable to proceedings at' law as well as suits in equity. Cf. First

less; but no way has been discovered of relieving a
defendant from the necessity of a trial to establish the
fact.
Fourth. The Circuit Court of Appeals should have
reversed the decrees for a preliminary injunction. It is
true that ordinarily the decree of a District Court granting or denying a preliminary injunction will not be disturbed on appeal. But that rule of practice has no
application where, as here, there was an insuperable objection to the maintenance of the suit in point of jurisdiction and where it clearly appears that the decree was
the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion.' 2 Since the constitutionality of the Act has been
determined by our decision in National Labor Relations

the defect in the bill is incapable of remedy by amendment, its dismissal should be directed.'
Fifth. In No. 182, also, the Circuit Court of Appeals
should have reversed the decree for a preliminary injunction and directed dismissal of the bill. The plaintiffs, officers of the so-called Plan of Representation of
Employees, alleged, in addition to the facts already
stated, that the employees are satisfied with their existing contracts of employment and desire to retain the
existing Plan without change; that the holding of the
proposed hearing will discredit the Plan and destroy its
usefulness to the employees; that they will be deprived
of their right to negotiate by the method of their choice,
the value of which has been proved by years of operation;
that alteration of the Plan will cause dissatisfaction
among the employees; that operation of plant will be
disrupted by labor disturbances; that employment will
be interrupted; and that the damage to the employees
will be irreparable. These additional allegations furnish
no reason why the Board should be prevented from exercising the exclusive initial jurisdiction conferred upon it
by Congress.
