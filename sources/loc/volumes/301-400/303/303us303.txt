COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 375.

Argued February 1, 1938.-Decided February 28, 1938.

1. Sec. 302 (c) of the Rev. Act of 1926, which required that there
be included in a decedent's estate, for estate tax purposes, any
property interest of which the decedent has "at any time" made
a transfer in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, was amended by the Joint
Resolution of March 3, 1931, to include "a transfer under which
the transferor has retained for his life . . . the possession or
enjoyment of, or the income from, the property." Section 803 (a)
of the Rev. Act of June 6, 1932, substantially reenacts this
provision. Held:
(1) That the added provision does not apply to transfers made
before, by decedents who died after, the enactment of the Joint
Resolution. P. 307.
(2) This construction is confirmed (a) by the legislative history
and administrative interpretation of the Joint Resolution; (b) by
its re6nactment in the light of that interpretation. P. 309.
2. Section 302 (h) of the Rev. Act of 1926, provided "Except as
otherwise specifically provided therein subdivisions (b), (c), (d),
(e), (f), and (g) of this section shall apply to the transfers,
trusts, estates, interests, rights, powers, and relinquishment of
powers, as severally enumerated and described therein, whether
made, created, arising, existing, exercised, or relinquished before
or after the enactment of this Act." Subdivision (c) dealt with
transfers in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, death. The Joint Resolution of
1931, supra, amended § 302 (c) to include non-testamentary

transfers with reservation of life estate to transferor. Held that
§ 302 (h) does not make the amendment apply retroactively to
the kind of transfers thereby added. P. 313.
3. An adoption by one section of a statute of the particular provisions of another section by specific and descriptive reference
does not embrace other particulars added later by amendment
to the section so referred to. P. 314.
4. In the absence of clear expression to the contrary, a law is presumed to operate prospectively. Id.

doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. Id.

Opinion of the Court.

Revenue Act of 1932,' includes in the gross estate of a
decedent, for estate tax, property which, before the adoption of the amendments, was irrevocably transferred with
reservation of a life estate to the transferor; and that, so
applied, the statute does not offend the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The numerous cases pending in the courts and the Board of Tax
Appeals involving these questions, and the claim that decisions of this court have not settled the matter, moved
us to grant certiorari.
The respondents in No. 375 are executors under the
will of a decedent who died November 20, 1932. On February 13, 1924, voluntarily and without valuable consideration, he transferred to a trustee property which he
expected to receive under the will of his brother, reserving to himself the income for life, directing division of
the income after his death between nephews and nieces
and distribution of the corpus, upon the death of the survivor of them, amongst their then living issue. After
his brother's death, and on October 22, 1926, he duly ratified and confirmed the original trust instrument. The
Commissioner ruled that the value of the trust assets
should be included in the decedent's gross estate, in the
view that the transfer was testamentary, because made in
contemplation of death, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, within the meaning of § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926. The respondents paid the resulting tax and sued for refund in
the District Court of Massachusetts. Judgment went for
the Collector.4 The Circuit Court of Appeals held that
the District Court erred in concluding that the transfer
was made in contemplation of death or was intended to
take effect in possession or enjoyment after death. The
petitioner nevertheless insisted upon the legality of the

exaction as the decedent died after the 1931 and 1932
amendments of § 302 (c), which declared the property
transferred a part of the gross estate for computation of
estate tax, in virtue of the reservation to the transferor
of the income for his life. The court overruled the contention, holding that, if so retroactively enforced, the legislation violated the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and reversed the judgment.' In his application for
certiorari the petitioner did not assign error to the Circuit
Court's ruling as to the nontestamentary character of the
transfer but confined his attack to the decision that the
amendments of § 302 (c) could not constitutionally be
invoked to sustain the tax.
In No. 484 it appears that the decedent died intestate
June 4, 1933. The respondent, her son, is her administrator. November 15, 1920, she transferred to him certain cash and securities. On the same day they entered
into an agreement reciting an understanding that, in
case of his death during her life, the securities and cash
should be reconveyed to her and, in the meantime, he
should pay her such portions of the income therefrom
as she might from time to time request in writing; that
while he held the securities he might invest and reinvest;
that he should bequeath her all the assets constituting
the fund, in case she survived him; that she would reimburse him for any increased income taxes payable by
him in virtue of his ownership of the fund and that, if
she should survive him and take the property under his
will, she would reimburse his estate for state and federal
inheritance taxes due by reason of the bequest. The
agreement contained other provisions for the safeguarding and separate custody of the fund during the mother's
life. The respondent paid the decedent portions of the
income upon her request. He executed a will bequeath5 90 F. (2d) 833.

ing the property to her on the terms mentioned in the
agreement, but upon her death, he revoked the bequest.
The Commissioner included the value of the fund in the
decedent's gross estate, holding that she had made a
transfer within the terms of § 302 (c) of the Revenue
Act of 1926, as amended in 1931 and 1932. The Board of
Tax Appeals reversed the Commissioner's determination
and the Court of Appeals affirmed its action' upon the
authority of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
of the First Circuit in No. 375 and that of the Seventh
Circuit in Helvering v. Bullard, ante, p. 297.
Counsel for the Government argue that the Joint Resolution of 1931 and § 803 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932
were intended to impose an estate tax measured by transfers of the sort therein described which had been irrevocably made prior to the passage of the legislation and
that, so construed, they are not arbitrarily or unreasonably retroactive and do not offend the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment. Counsel for respondents answer that the enactments were intended to --- ate only,
d, if conupon transfers subsequently consummated
strued to reach the past transfers here involved, violate
the amendment. We hold that the statutes are prospective in their operation and do not impose a tax in
respect of past irrevocable transfers with reservation of
a life interest.
Ascertainment of the intended application of the Joint
Resolution of March 3, 1931, and § 803 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, involves a reading of them in the light
of cases construing similar phraseology of earlier acts,
their legislative history and administrative interpretation.
There is agreement that § 803 (a) reenacted the substance of the Joint Resolution with but slight verbal differences. It will, therefore, be necessary to quote only
691 F. (2d) 1010.

the Resolution. By it § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of
1926, supra, was amended to provide:
"The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be
determined by including the value at the time of his
death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated"(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which
the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust
or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take
effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,
including a transfer under which the transferor has retained for his lifeor any period not ending before his
death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the income
from, the property or (2) the right to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for
an adequate and full consideration in money or money's
worth."
The matter in ordinary type is § 302 (c) as it was prior
to amendment; the additions are in italics:
The Government relies on the words "at any time" as
demonstrating that the legislation was intended to apply
to transfers made before its adoption and is so unequivocal as to leave no room for construction. This phrase,
appearing in an earlier revenue act, had, however, been
held not to render the statute effective upon transfers
antedating the passage of the Act' and Congkess apparently realized that the expression did not carry the
statute back so as to embrace transactions consununated
before its passage; for, in subsection (h) of § 302 of the

giving rise to a tax by virtue of preceding subsections, it
directed that they should be taxable "whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised, or relinquished before
or after the enactment of this Act." ' We conclude that
the meaning of the section is not so free from doubt as
to preclude inquiry concerning the legislative purpose.
The history of the Resolution is of material aid in its
construction. Section 302 (c) of the Act of 1926, like
earlier acts, measured the tax by the inclusion in the
gross estate of property of which the decedent had made
a voluntary transfer in contemplation of, or intended to
take effect- in possession or enjoyment at or after his
death. Notwithstanding the Treasury had ruled that a
transfer of assets with a reservation of income for the
donor's life came within the definition this court held
otherwise. 10 Dissatisfied with the decision, the Government sought a reversal of it but, in three judgments, announced on March 2,1931, the ruling was reaffirmed. 1" In
the opinions in these cases, which led to the preparation
and adoption of the Resolution, the court said there was
"no question of the constitutional authority of the Congress to impose prospectively a tax with respect to transfers or trusts of the sort here involved . . ." There then
remained one day of the current session of Congress.
The Treasury drafted an amendment of § 302 (c) to bring
trusts of this type within its sweep, in the form of the
Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, which was sent to
Congress on the day of our decisions and was passed,

under a suspension of the rules, on the next day, the last
of the session.12
Because its passage was considered exigent the Resolution was adopted without having been printed and in
reliance on statements made from the floor. The Congressional Record discloses the understanding of the Congress with respect to its scope. Mr. Garner, of the House
Ways and Means Committee, stated: "The Committee
on Ways and Means this afternoon had a meeting and
unanimously reported the resolution just passed. We
did not make it retroactive for the reason that we were
afraid that the Senate would not agree to it." "
Mr. Hawley, of the same Committee, in charge of the
Resolution, stated, in answer to a question: "It provides
that hereafter no such method shall be used to evade
the tax" and, referring to the situation created by the
decisions of this court, he said:
"It is entirely apparent that if this situation is permitted to continue, the Federal estate tax will be seriously affected. Entirely apart from the refunds that may
be expected to result, it is to be anticipated that many
persons will proceed to execute trusts or other varieties
of transfers under which they will be enabled to escape
the estate tax upon their property. It is of the greatest
importance therefore that this situation be corrected and
that this obvious opportunity for tax avoidance be removed. It is for that purpose that the joint resolution is
proposed."
This language, we think, scarcely bears the interpretation put upon it by Government counsel,-that the tax
was meant to be laid on estates of all who died after the
adoption of the Resolution.
.Bearing in mind that the Resolution was prepared and
its passage recommended by the Treasury, the adminis12

trative interpretation supports in uncommon measure the
view that it was not intended to operate upon transfers
completed prior to its passage. Promptly upon its passage the Department issued T. D. 4314,14 approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury May 22, 1931, which was
in the form of a letter to collectors of internal revenue
and others concerhed. It quoted the language of the
resolution and stated:
"In view of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States in Nichols v. Coolidge, (274 U. S., 531 [T.
D. 4072, C. B. VI-2, 351]), May v. Heiner, (281 U. S.,

and Cyrus H. McCormick v. Burnet (51 S. Ct., 343),
the portion added by the amendment to section 302 (c)
of the Revenue Act of 1926, as set forth above in italic,
will, notwithstanding the provisions of section 302 (h)
of that Act, be applied prospectively only; i. e., to such
transfers coming within the amendment as were made
after 10.30 p. m., Washington, D. C., time, March 3,
1931.
"Regulations 70, 1929 edition, will be amended to
make the changes necessitated by the amendment to section 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 and the above
decisions of the Supreme Court." (Italics in the original.)
April 11, 1932, Regulations 70 were amended by T. D.
4336 and, in part, read:
"Art. 18. Retention of possession, enjoyment, or income.-Any transfer which was made by the decedent
after 10.30 p. m., Washington, D. C., time, March 3, 1931,
and under which he retained for his life or any period
not ending before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the income from, the property or (2) the

right to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy
the property or the income therefrom, is taxable, provided
such transfer was not a bona fide sale for an adequate
and full consideration in money or money's worth."
Not only is the legislative history of § 803 (a) of the
Act of 1932 bare of indication of any purpose that it
should affect past transfers, but what appears tends to
disprove any such thought.'" Moreover, the reenactment
of the Resolution of 1931 in the light of the administrative rulings requires the conclusion that Congress approved and adopted the administrative construction of
the provision it reenacted. 0
Regulations 80, approved November 7, 1934, after paraphrasing § 803 (a), concluded: "The provisions of this
subdivision do not apply (1) if the transfer was made
prior to 10.30 p. m., eastern standard time, March 3, 1931,
and (2) if the decedent died prior to 5 p. m. eastern standard time, June 6, 1932 [The date of passage of the Revenue Act of 1932]. See section 506 of the Revenue Act
of 1934." This regulation was retained as Article 18 in
the 1937 edition of Regulations 80 issued October 26,
15 The reports of

the Committees of both House and Senate con-

tain this statement: "The purpose of this amendment to section
302 (c) of the revenue act of 1926 is to clarify in certain respects
the amendments made to that section by the joint resolution of
March 3, 1931, which were adopted to render taxable a transfer
under which the decedent reserved the income for his life. The joint
resolution was designed to avoid the effect of decisions of the Supreme
Court holding such a transfer not taxable if irrevocable and not
made in contemplation of death. Certain new matter has also been
added, which is without retroactive effect" (House Committee
Report No. 708, 72nd Cong., 1st Sess.; Senate Committee Report
No. 665, same session).

Opinion of the Court.

1937. Thus while the regulations have been altered to
treat § 803 (a) of the 1932 Act as retroactively affecting
transfers made after March 3, 1931, the Department has
consistently ruled that the Resolution of 1931 has no application to transfers made prior to its adoption. The
position thus recently taken is inconsistent in its treatment of the two like enactments and is difficult to understand in view of the consistent interpretation of the Joint
Resolution but it fails to weaken the force of that consistent interpretation with knowledge of which Congress
reenacted the same provision in 1932.
The Government urges that all of these circumstances
which are persuasive that the enactments were intended
to operate for the future are overborne by § 302 (h) of
the Revenue Act of 1926, which is:
"Except as otherwise specifically provided therein subdivisions (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section
shall apply to the transfers, trusts, estates, interests,
rights, powers, and relinquishment of powers, as severally
enumerated and described therein, whether made, created,
arising, existing, exercised, or relinquished before or after
the enactment of this Act." (Italics supplied.)
It will be remembered that the Joint Resolution of
1931 amended § 302 (c) of the Act of 1926 to cover transfers such as are here involved. It made no reference to
any other portion of that Act. Since § 302 (c) in its
original form was, by § 302 (h), made applicable to transfers whether made before or after the Act of 1926, the
contention is that it has like operation and effect as respects the provision added to it by the amendment. And
the same argument is advanced with respect to the
amendment of subse.ction (c) by the Act of 1932.
Resort is had to canons of constructions as an aid in
ascertaining the intent of the legislature. It may occur
that the intent is so clear that no such resort should be
indulged, and the Government claims this is such a case.

The matter is, we think, involved in sufficient ambiguity
to warrant our seeking such aid. A well-settled canon tends
to support the position of respondents: "Where one statute adopts the particular provisions of another by a specific and descriptive reference to the statute or provisions
adopted, the effect is the same as though the statute or
provisions adopted had been incorporated bodily into
the adopting statute . . . Such adoption takes the statute as it exists at the time of adoption and does not include subsequent additions or modifications of the statute so taken unless it does so by express intent.' 17 The
weight of authority holds this rule respecting two separate
acts applicable where, as here, one section of a statute
refers to another section which alone is amended."8
In view of other settled rules of statutory construction,
which teach that a law is presumed, in the absence of
clear expression to the contrary, to operate prospectively; i" that, if doubt exists as to the construction of a
taxing statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of
the taxpayer,'2- we feel bound to hold that the Joint Resolution of 1931 and § 803 (a) of the Act of 1932 apply
only to transfers with reservation of life income made
subsequent to the dates of their adoption respectively.

No. 415.

Argued February 4, 7, 1938.-Decided February 28, 1938.

1. Whether the Interstate Commerce Commission should approve a
pooling agreement between competing carriers, under § 5 (1) of the
Interstate Commerce' Act, is a question of public interest and
welfare. Other carriers, as well as shippers and other persons,
are entitled to be heard on this question; but a carrier which
is not a party to the agreement is not a "carrier involved,"
within the meaning of the section, even if adversely affected by
it, and may not frustrate the agreement by withholding its
assent. P. 319.
2. The 'M' railroad carried iron ore from the mines to a lake
port, part of the way over its own line and thence to the port
over the line of 'E' railroad under a trackage agreement. The
'N' railroad carried such ore from the mines to the port over its
own line. Both 'N' and 'M' interchanged other freight with 'E'
at their respective connections with that line. To effect economies, 'M' and 'N' applied for and obtained from the Interstate
Commerce Commission, under § 5 (1) of the Interstate Commerce
Act, an order sanctioning an agreement between them under
which ore consigned'over either would be routed over 'N', and the
ore business be pooled between them; and under which 'M' and 'N'
were also to pool their receipts from other traffic interchanged by
