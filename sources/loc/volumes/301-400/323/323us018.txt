CAROLENE PRODUCTS CO. ET AL. v. UNITED
STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 21.

Argued October 16, 17, 1944.-Decided November 6, 1944.

The Filled Milk Act forbids shipment in interstate commerce of
milk "to which has been added, or which has been blended, or
compounded with, any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that the
resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk." Held:
1. In a prosecution for violation of the Act, evidence that the
defendant's compound was not nutritionally deficient was properly
excluded. P. 22.
(a) The Act is not to be construed as inapplicable to products
in which nutritional deficiency has been corrected, although by
methods developed subsequently to the passage of the Act, since
the Act was aimed not only at nutritional deficiency but also at
substitution for or confusion with milk products. P. 22.
(b) Thus to control shipments in interstate commerce so as
to prevent confusion, deception and substitution is within the
power of Congress under the commerce clause. P. 23.
2. Though the Act applies only to products "in imitation or semblance of milk," such imitation or semblance may result from the
ingredients used and need not be the result of conscious effort.
P. 25.
3. As applied to the filled milk involved here, though the product
be assumed to be wholesome and properly labeled, the Act does
not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. P. 31.
(a) Judicial notice may be taken of reports of committees
of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which show that
considerations besides nutritional deficiency influenced passage of
the Act. P. 28.
(b) Here, milk from which a valuable element (butterfat)
has been removed is artificially enriched with cheaper fats and
vitamins so that it is indistinguishable by the average purchaser
from whole milk products. The result is that the compound is
confused with and passed off as the whole milk product despite
proper labeling. P. 31.
(c) When Congress exercises a delegated power such as that
over interstate commerce, the methods which it employs may be

CERTIORARI,

Mr.Samuel H. Kaufman, with whom Messrs. Crampton
Harrisand George Trosk were on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Chester T. Lane, with whom Solicitor GeneralFahy
and Assistant Attorney General Tom C. Clark were on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.
The limited writ of certiorari in this case was granted
to review petitioners' conviction, affirmed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, for a violation of the Filled Milk Act.'
The Court was moved to allow the petition in order to
examine the contentions that the accused articles of food
cannot, under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, be banned from commerce when
these compounds are nutritionally sufficient and not "in
imitation or semblance" of milk or any milk product within the meaning of the statute and are not sold as milk or
a milk product.
The contentions which are raised by petitioners to avoid
their conviction were not dealt with in our prior decision
which upheld the act's validity upon demurrer to an earlier
indictment which charged its violation. United States

sues are important to those affected by the act, certiorari
was granted. 321 U. S. 760. Questions of due process
under the Fourteenth Amendment, similar to those presented here, had arisen from state filled-milk legislation
with varying results.3 Consideration by this Court of
the filled-milk legislation of Kansas appears in Sage Stores
Co. v. Kansas,post, p. 32.
The facts, which are undisputed, are fully set out in
the opinions of the District Court and the Circuit Court
of Appeals. It is sufficient for our purposes to summarize
them as follows. The corporate petitioner sells the products mentioned in the indictment which are manufactured
for it by another corporation from skim milk, that is, milk
from which a large percentage of the butterfat has been
removed. The process of manufacture consists of taking
natural whole milk, extracting the butterfat content and
then adding cottonseed or cocoanut oil and fish liver oil,
which latter oil contains vitamins A and D. The process
includes pasteurization of the milk, evaporation, homogenization of the mixture and sterilization. The compound is sold under various trade names in cans of the
same size and shape as those used for evaporated milk.
court to grant an interlocutory or final decree which would enjoin
prosecution of the corporate petitioner for alleged violation of the
Filled Milk Act. The affirmance was based on a lack of necessity
for equitable intervention to protect the Carolene Products Co. from
criminal prosecution.

which were based on the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were: Carolene Products Co. v. Harter,329 Pa. 49, 197 A. 627;

CAROLENE PRODUCTS CO. v. U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The contents of the can are practically indistinguishable
by the buying public from evaporated whole milk, but the
cans are truthfully labeled to show the trade names and
the ingredients.
The indictment charged the petitioner corporation and
the individual petitioners, its president and vice president, with violation of the statute by making interstate
shipments of the compounds contrary to § 2." The convictions and sentences are assailed as improper on three
grounds: first, that the petitioner's compounds were not
covered by the rationale of the Filled Milk Act; second,
that the Act did not cover the compounds because they
were not "in imitation or semblance" of a milk product;
and third, that since the compounds were wholesome
food products and sold without fraud, in any sense, Congress could not constitutionally prohibit their interstate
shipment.
First. As a basis for petitioner's position that the Filled
Milk Act does not cover their compounds, it is argued
that the nutritional deficiencies of filled milks led to the
Act's enactment so as to protect the public health. These
deficiencies occurred because the extraction of the butterfat from the whole milk removed a large proportion of the
fat soluble vitamins A and D. The hearings on the bill
and the course of the debate make it quite clear that 'this
vitamin deficiency was of major importance in bringing
about the enactment of the act.' Petitioners then offered
4 "SEC. 2. . .
It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to ship
or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, any filled
milk.
"SEC. 3. Any person violating any provision of this Act shall upon
conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or
imprisonment of not more than one year, or both; . . ." 42 Stat.

in the trial court to prove, that since the passage of the
Filled Milk Act in 1923, the technique of fortification of
foods with vitamins A and D had advanced to a point
where these vitamins could be restored to skim milk compounds so that the compounds were equally valuable in
that respect to whole milk products and that their products had been so enriched. The offer was refused.
Filled milk is defined in § 1 (c) of the act as any milk,
"whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated,
powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been added,
or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat
or oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is
in imitation or semblance of milk . .. , whether or not
condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or
desiccated." The petitioner's compounds, it is agreed, fall
within this definition. But, petitioners contend, they do
not fall within its spirit, since the vitamins which cause
deficiency have been restored and that therefore the act is
inapplicable to the enriched compounds within that rule
of statutory construction, as illustrated by Church of the
Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457; United
States v. Aetna Explosives Co., 256 U. S. 402, and other
cases, which excludes from the coverage of a statute things
or situations which are beyond the legislative intent.
Petitioners' position as to the legislative purpose of the
act was not accepted by the trial or reviewing court. We
agree with those courts. While, as we have stated above,
the vitamin deficiency was an efficient cause in bringing
about the enactment of the Filled Milk Act, it was not
the sole reason for its passage. A second reason was that
the compounds lend themselves readily to substitution

for or confusion with milk products. Although, so far as
the rct.ord shows, filled milk compounds as enriched are
equally wholesome and nutritious as milk with the same
content of calories and vitamins, they are artificial or
manufactured foods which are cheaper to produce than
similar whole milk products. When compounded and
canned, whether enriched or not, they are indistinguishable by the ordinary consumer from processed natural
milk. The purchaser of these compounds does not get
evaporated milk. This situation has not changed since
the enactment of the act. The possibility and actuality
of confusion, deception and substitution was appraised
by Congress6 The prevention of such practices or dangers through control of shipments in interstate commerce
is within the power of Congress. United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. at p. 148; cf. McCray v.
United States, 195 U. S. 27, 63. The manner by which
Congress carries out this power, subject to constitutional
objections which are considered hereinafter in part

H. Rep. No. 355, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2: "The compound can

sold under various trade names. . . . The manufacturers can not sell

it as milk, but it is put up in the same size cans as regular condensed
milk, and the evidence before the committee shows that it is advertised
by the retail dealers as milk and evaporated milk. Storekeepers sell
it with the statements that 'it takes the place of milk,' 'just as good
as condensed and much cheaper,' 'nothing better on the market,'
'takes the place of condensed milk.' Instances have been found in
which the coconut fat was mixed with milk and sold for cream; the
compound has been used for making ice cream ....

In many cases

retailers sell the compound for the same price as the straight evaporated milk, although the price per 1-pound can to them is about 3
cents less. A number of surveys in various parts of the country show
that the compound is sold largely in sections inhabited by people
unable to read English and sections inhabited by people of limited
means, and not sold at all in better residential districts." Cf. also

"Third" of this opinion, is within legislative discretion,"
even though the method chosen is prohibition of manufacture, sale or shipment.8 Congress evidently determined that exclusion from commerce of filled milk compounds in the semblance of milk was an appropriate
method to strike at evils which it desired to suppress.
Although it now is made to appear that one evil, the nutritional deficiencies, has been overcome, the evil of confusion remains and Congress has left the statute in effect.
It seems to us clear, therefore, that there is no justification
for judicial interference to withdraw these assumedly nondeleterious compounds from the prohibitions of the act.
It follows from the point of view of the coverage of the

act that it was not erroneous to refuse to consider the
evidence which petitioners offered as to the wholesomeness of the compounds.
Second. The petitioners urge another reason why the
act does not cover their compounds. This ground is that
the compounds are not "in imitation or semblance" of
milk within the meaning of the act's definition of filled
milk. § 1 (c), supra,p. 22. Compare State v. Carolene
Products Co., 346 Mo. 1049, 1060-62, 144 S. W. 2d 153.
We agree that the product must be in imitation or semblance of milk to fall within the prohibition of the act.
Petitioners rely upon the admitted fact that no ingredient is added to the skim milk, oil and vitamins to
alter the appearance of the compound. Accepting the
evidence that the compounds are indistinguishable from
whole milk products by purchasers, it is urged that they
cannot be held to be in "imitation or semblance" of milk
unless the manufacturer purposefully adds something to
make the mixture simulate milk. It is said Congress
adopted this language from § 64 (3) of the Farms and
Markets Law of New York.' Prior to that time, the
Court of Appeals of New York, in construing the words
"imitation or semblance" as they appeared in another section of the New York law directed at the regulation of
oleomargarine, had interpreted them as denouncing trade
in oleomargarine only when the manufacturer consciously
and purposefully attempted to create an imitation or semblance of milk products. People v. Guiton, 210 N. Y.
9 Sec. 64 (3). "No person shall manufacture, sell or exchange, offer
or expose for sale or exchange, or have in his possession with the intent
to sell or exchange any condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered,
dried or desiccated milk, cream or skimmed milk to which there has
been added or with which there has been mixed, blended or compounded, any fats or oils, other than milk fat, so that the finished
product shall be in imitation or semblance of condensed, evaporated,
concentrated, powdered, dried or desiccated milk." N. Y. Laws 1922,
ch. 365, § 64, as amended.

323 U. S.

1, 8, 9, 103 N. E. 773. The adoption of these words after
this interpretation and in the face of the Congressional
knowledge of the New York decision and of the controversy over the effect of the use of such language,"° petitioners contend, brings into play the general rule that
adoption of the wording of a statute from another legislative jurisdiction carries with it the previous judicial interpretations of the wording. Willis v. Eastern Trust &
Banking Co., 169 U. S. 295, 307; cf. James v. Appel, 192
U. S. 129, 135; Joines v. Patterson,274 U. S. 544, 549.
The cases just cited have established under suitable
conditions the rule for which petitioners contend that the
interpretation goes with the act. It is a presumption of
legislative intention, however, which varies in strength
with the similarity of the language, the established character of the decisions in the jurisdiction from which the
language was adopted and the presence or lack of other
indicia of intention. Copper Queen Mining Co. v. Arizona
Board, 206 U. S. 474, 479; Whitney v. Fox, 166 U. S.
637, 647.
Here we cannot be sure that Congress, deliberately or
otherwise, adopted the wording from the New York statute. In § 2 of the federal act of August 2, 1886, 24 Stat.
209, taxing and regulating oleomargarine, somewhat similar language occurs.1 ' That may be the source of the

substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds,
including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known

phrase. Furthermore the Guiton case did not interpret
the section of the New York statute upon which petitioners contend the federal act is modeled. In the Guiton
case, the Court of Appeals explained the force of "imitation and semblance" as used in the oleomargarine section,
§ 38, N. Y. Laws 1909, ch. 9. That court relied upon the
special statutory definition of oleomargarine in § 30, id.,
as a reason for its conclusion that the words prohibited
only conscious imitation, 210 N. Y. 7. Oleomargarine was
there defined as an article "in the semblance of butter."
The court thought that as the sale of natural oleomargarine, which might have the "semblance" of butter was
permitted, it was not intended to prohibit products which
looked like butter unless the imitation came from choice.
As no corresponding definition of filled milk occurs, there
could be no certainty that the same result would be
reached, if New York had been called upon to interpret
section 64.
Finally, as determinative of the intention of Congress
to include compounds whose resemblance to milk products arises from their ingredients and not from conscious
effort, we note the fact that compounds of this innocent
character were specifically included by name in the list of
compounds which the Congressional reports pointed out
as products which were covered by the proposed act.'"
Petitioner's compounds were themselves so named. The
addition of vitamins does not affect their physical likeness
to milk products.
Third. If the Filled Milk Act is applicable to the compounds whose shipment was the basis of the indictment
in this case, as we have just concluded, petitioners assert
coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or
semblance of butter, or when so made, calculated or intended to be
sold as butter or for butter." 24 Stat. 209.

that the act, as thus applied, violates the due process clause
of the Fifth Amendment. Their argument runs in this
manner. Since these enriched compounds are admittedly
wholesome and sold under trade names with proper labels
without the commission of any fraud by petitioners on
the public, Congress cannot prohibit their interstate shipment without denying to petitioners a right protected by
the due process clause, the right to trade in innocent articles. They rely upon Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., 270
U. S. 402, and continue their protest against the refusal
of the trial court to receive the evidence as to the wholesomeness of their product.
We do not need to consider the refusal of the trial court

petitioner's products. Such evidence could be material

Milk Act. The trial court took judicial notice, as did the
District Court of the District of Columbia, United States
v. Carolene Products Co., 51 F. Supp. 675, 678-79, and
as we do, of the reports of the committees of the House
of Representatives and the Senate which show that other
considerations than nutritional deficiencies influenced the
prohibition of the shipment of filled milk in interstate
commerce. These unchallenged reports, as we indicated

in part "First" above, furnish an adequate basis, other
than unwholesomeness, for the action of Congress.14 The
reports show that it was disputable as to whether wholesome filled milk should be excluded from commerce because of the danger of its confusion with the condensed
or evaporated natural product or whether regulation
would be sufficient. The power was in Congress to decide
its own course. We need look no further.15
Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., supra, is not to the contrary. This Court thought that under the facts of that
record there was no reasonable basis for the legislative
determination that the use of shoddy in comfortables was
dangerous to the public health or that it offered opportunity for deception, pp. 412 and 414. Therefore the
prohibition of its use violated the due process clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Sterilization, inspection
and labeling were deemed to be sufficient to negative the
possibility of such evils. It was pointed out in the course
of the opinion, p. 413, that where the possibility of evil
was not negatived, legislation prohibiting the sale of a
wholesome article would not be invalidated. Powell v.
Pennsylvania,127 U. S. 678. In dealing with the evils of
filled milk, Congress reached the conclusion that labeling
was not an adequate remedy for deception. On the point
of the constitutionality in relation to due process of the
prohibition of trade in articles which are not in themselves dangerous but which make other evils more difficult

to control, such as confusion in the filled milk legislation,
the Powell case is authority for the validity of Congressional action in the Filled Milk Act. It involved a sale of
an article assumed to be just as good as butter but which
was prohibited because of its ingredients. In the Powell
case, this Court said:
"The defendant then offered to prove by Prof. Hugo
Blanck that he saw manufactured the article sold to the
prosecuting witness; that it was made from pure animal
fats; that the process of manufacture was clean and
wholesome, the article containing the same elements as
dairy butter, . . . that the oleaginous substances in the
manufactured article were substantially identical with
those produced from milk or cream; and that the article
sold to the prosecuting witness was a wholesome and nutritious article of food, in all respects as wholesome as
butter produced from pure unadulterated milk or cream
from unadulterated milk." Pp. 681-82.
"It will be observed that the offer in the court below
was to show by proof that the particular articles the defendant sold, and those in his possession for sale, in violation of the statute, were, in fact, wholesome or nutritious
articles of food. It is entirely consistent with that offer
that many, indeed, that most kinds of oleomargarine butter in the market contain ingredients that are or may become injurious to health. The court cannot say, from
anything of which it may take judicial cognizance, that
such is not the fact. ...
"Whether the manufacture of oleomargarine, or imitation butter, of the kind described in the statute, is, or
may be, conducted in such a way, or with such skill and
secrecy, as to baffle ordinary inspection, or whether it involves such danger to the public health as to require, for
the protection of the people, the entire suppression of the
business, rather than its regulation in such manner as to
permit the manufacture and sale of articles of that class

that do not contain noxious ingredients, are questions of
fact and of public policy which belong to the legislative
department to determine. And as it does not appear
upon the face of the statute, or from any facts of which
the court must take judicial cognizance, that it infringes
rights secured by the fundamental law, the legislative
determination of those questions is conclusive upon the
courts." Pp. 684-85.
In Hebe Co. v. Shaw, 248 U. S. 297, this Court in 1919
upheld the validity of an Ohio statute which prohibited
the sale of condensed milk made otherwise than from
whole milk against an attack under the Fourteenth
Amendment. It was assumed that the compound was
wholesome and it was properly labeled. The act was sustained, however, as a proper exercise of legislative power
to protect the public against fraudulent substitution,

In the action of Congress on filled milk there is no prohibition of the shipment of an article of commerce merely
because it competes with another such article which it resembles. Such would be the prohibition of the shipment
of cotton or silk textiles to protect rayon or nylon or of
anthracite to aid the consumption of bituminous coal or
of cottonseed oil to aid the soybean industry. Here a
milk product, skimmed milk, from which a valuable element-butterfat-has been removed is artificially enriched with cheaper fats and vitamins so that it is indistinguishable in the eyes of the average purchaser from
whole milk products. The result is that the compound
is confused with and passed off as the whole milk product
in spite of proper labeling.
When Congress exercises a delegated power such as that
over interstate commerce, the methods which it employs
to carry out its purposes are beyond attack without a clear
and convincing showing that there is no rational basis for

SAGE STORES CO. ET AL. v. KANSAS EX REL.
MITCHELL (SUBSTITUTED AS ATTORNEY
GENERAL).
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KANSAS.
No. 34. Argued October 17, 1944.-Decided November 6, 1944.
A statute of Kansas forbids the sale or keeping for sale of milk "to
which has been added any fat or oil other than milk fat." One of
the purposes of the legislation was prevention of fraud and deception in the sale of such compounds. Held:
1. The statute does not violate the equal protection clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 34.
The statute is not without rational. basis even though it permits the sale of skim milk while forbidding the sale of allegedly
more nutritive compounds.
2. The question of the coverage of the statute is one of state
law. P. 35.
3. As applied to the petitioners' products, which had the taste,
consistency, color and appearance of whole milk products, the
statute did not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Carolene Products Co. v. United States, ante, p. 18.
