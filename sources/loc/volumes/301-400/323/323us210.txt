323 U. S.

TUNSTALL v. BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE
FIREMEN & ENGINEMEN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.

No. 37. Argued November 14, 1944.-Decided December 18, 1944.
1. The Railway Labor Act imposes on a labor organization, acting
as the exclusive bargaining representative of a craft or class of railway employees, the duty to represent all the employees in the
craft without discrimination because of race. Steele v. Louisville &
Nashville R. Co., ante, p. 192. P. 211.
2. The federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain a non-diversity
suit in which petitioner, a railway employee subject to the Railway
Labor Act, seeks remedies by injunction and award of damages for
the failure of the union bargaining representative of his craft to
perform the duty imposed on it by the Act, to represent petitioner
and other members of his craft without discrimination because of
race. P. 212.
3. Petitioner's cause of action is not excluded by the Railway Labor
Act from the consideration of the federal courts. P. 213.
4. The right asserted by the petitioner is derived from the duty imposed by the Railway Labor Act on the bargaining representative,
and is a federal right implied from the statute and the policy which
it has adopted. P. 213.
5. The case is therefore one arising under a law regulating commerce,
of which the federal courts are given jurisdiction by 28 U. S. C. § 41
(8). P. 213.
6. The petitioner has no administrative remedy available, and the
bill of complaint states a cause of action entitling him to relief.
P. 213.
140 F. 2d 35, reversed.
CERTIORARI,

judgment dismissing a complaint for want of jurisdiction.

Solicitor General Fahy, Messrs. Robert L. Stern, Alvin

Edgar Watkins, John D. Miller, Arthur Garfield Hays, R.
Beverley Herbert,and T. Pope Shepherd on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union, as amici curiae, in support of petitioner.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a companion case to Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., ante, p. 192, in which we answered in the
affirmative a question also presented in this case. The
question is whether the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1185,
45 U. S. C. §§ 151 et seq., imposes on a labor organization,
acting as the exclusive bargaining representative of a craft
or class of railway employees, the duty to represent all
the employees in the craft without discrimination because
of their race. The further question in this case is whether
the federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain a nondiversity suit in which petitioner, a railway employee
subject to the Act, seeks remedies by injunction and award
of damages for the failure of the union bargaining representative of his craft to perform the duty imposed on it
by the Act, to represent petitioner and other members of
his craft without discrimination because of race.
Petitioner, a Negro fireman, employed by the Norfolk
& Southern Railway, brought this suit in the District Court
against the Railway, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire-

men and Enginemen and certain of its subsidiary lodges,
and one of its officers, setting up, in all material respects, a
cause of action like that alleged in the Steele case. The
Brotherhood, a labor union, is the designated bargaining
representative under the Railway Labor Act, for the craft
of firemen of which petitioner is a member, and is accepted
as such by the Railway and its employees.
Acting as such the Brotherhood gave to the Railway
the notice of March 28, 1940, and later entered into the
contract of February 18, 1941 and its subsequent modifications, all of which were the subject of our consideration in
the Steele case. Petitioner complains of the discriminatory application of the contract provisions to him and
other Negro members of his craft in favor of "promotable,"
i. e. white, firemen, by which he has been deprived of his
pre-existing seniority rights, removed from the interstate
passenger run to which he was assigned and then assigned
to more arduous and difficult work with longer hours in
yard service, his place in the passenger service being filled
by a white fireman.
He alleges that the contract was signed and put into
effect without notice to him or other Negro members of
his craft, and without opportunity for them to be heard
with respect to its terms, and that his protests and demands for relief to the Railway and the Brotherhood have
been unavailing. Petitioner prays for a declaratory adjudication of his rights, for an injunction restraining the
discriminatory practices complained of, for an award of
damages and for other relief.
The District Court dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, 140 F. 2d 35, on the ground that the federal
courts are without jurisdiction of the cause, there being
no diversity of citizenship and, insofar as the suit is
grounded on the wrongful acts of respondents, it is not
one arising under the laws of the United States, even

Opinion of the Court.

though the union was chosen as bargaining representative
pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. See Gully v. First
NationalBank, 299 U. S. 109, 112, 114.
For the reasons stated in our opinion in the Steele case
the Railway Labor Act itself does not exclude the petitioner's cause of action from the consideration of the federal courts. Cf. Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, 320 U. S. 297; General Committee v. M.-K.-T.
R. Co., 320 U. S. 323; General Committee v. Southern Pacific Co., 320 U. S. 338; Brotherhood of Clerks v. United
Transport Service Employees, 320 U. S. 715, 816, with
Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway
Clerks, 281 U. S. 548; Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, 300 U. S. 515.
We also hold that the right asserted by petitioner which
is derived from the duty imposed by the Railway Labor
Act on the Brotherhood, as bargaining representative, is
a federal right implied from the statute and the policy
which it has adopted. It is the federal statute which
condemns as unlawful the Brotherhood's conduct. "The
extent and nature of the legal consequences of this condemnation, though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless to be derived from it and the
federal policy which it has adopted." Deitrick v. Greaney,
309 U. S. 190, 200-201; Board of County Commissioners
v. United States, 308 U. S. 343; Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Co., 317 U. S. 173, 176-7; cf. Clearfield Trust Co. v.
United States, 318 U. S. 363. The case is therefore one
arising under a law regulating commerce of which the federal courts are given jurisdiction by 28 U. S. C. § 41 (8),
Judicial Code § 24 (8); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U. S. 38, 46;
Peyton v. Railway Express Agency, 316 U. S. 350; cf. Illinois Steel Co. v. B. & 0. R. Co., 320 U. S. 508, 510-511.
For the reasons also stated in our opinion in the Steele
case the petitioner is without available administrative
remedies, resort to which, when available, is prerequisite

to equitable relief in the federal courts.

Goldsmith v.

Board of Tax Appeals, 270 U. S. 117, 123; Porter v. In-

vestors Syndicate, 286 U. S. 461, 471; 287 U. S. 346; Natural Gas Co. v. Slattery, 302 U. S. 300, 309; Atlas Ins. Co.
v. Southern, Inc., 306 U. S. 563.
We hold, as in the Steele case, that the bill of complaint

states a cause of action entitling plaintiff to relief. As
other jurisdictional questions were raised in the courts
below which have not been considered by the Court of
Appeals, the case will be remanded to that court for fur-

ther proceedings.

KOREMATSU v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 22.

Argued October 11, 12, 1944.-Decided December 18, 1944.

1. Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 which, during a state of war with
Japan and as a protection against espionage and sabotage, was
promulgated by the Commanding General of the Western Defense
Command under authority of Executive Order No. 9066 and the
Act of March 21, 1942, and which directed the exclusion after May
9, 1942 from a described West Coast military area of all persons
of Japanese ancestry, held constitutional as of the time it was made
and when the petitioner-an American citizen of Japanese descent whose home was in the described area-violated it. P. 219.
2. The provisions of other orders requiring persons of Japanese ancestry to report to assembly centers and providing for the detention
of such persons in assembly and relocation centers were separate,
and their validity is not in issue in this proceeding. P. 222.
