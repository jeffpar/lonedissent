GEORGIA HARDWOOD LUMBER CO. v. COMPANIA
DE NAVEGACION TRANSMAR, S. A., OWNER OF
THE S. S. KOTOR.
CERTIORARI

No. 180.

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

Argued December 14, 1944.-Decided January 2, 1945.

1. Under § 8 (c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, which provides
that no appeal to a Circuit Court of Appeals shall be allowed
"unless application therefor be duly made within three months,"
and which is applicable to admiralty proceedings, the District
Court has discretion, where within the three months' period a
notice of appeal is filed in the office of the clerk of the court and
the intention to appeal is apparent, to treat the notice of appeal
as an application for allowance of an appeal; and the action of
the District Court in so treating a notice of appeal as an application for allowance of an appeal in this case was not an abuse of
discretion. P. 336.
2. Where the appeal statute merely requires that an application for
appeal be made within the prescribed time, the allowance may be
made subsequently. P. 337.
141 F. 2d 652, affirmed.

CERTIORARI,

post, p. 692, to review the reversal of a

decree dismissing a libel in admiralty.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the

opinion of the

Court.

This is an admiralty case here on certiorari from the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. A single
question is presented. Petitioner claims that the appeal
from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals

Opinion of the Court.

was not properly taken. Since the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to proceedings in admiralty,' the
question is whether the requirements of § 8 (c) of the Act
of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 940, 28 U. S. C. § 230,
were met. That section provides:
"No writ of error or appeal intended to bring any judgment or decree before a circuit court of appeals for review
shall be allowed unless application therefor be duly made
within three months after the entry of such judgment or
decree."
A final decree dismissing the libel was entered on April 20,
1943. On July 6, 1943, the libellant issued a notice of
appeal, served it on respondent's proctors and obtained
their acceptance. It filed the notice of appeal in the office
of the clerk of the District Court on July 12, 1943. Nothing else was done within the three months' period except
to consult the district judge on the amount of the appeal
bond. The assignment of errors and the appeal bond were
filed July 21st. A formal petition for appeal was filed on
August 12th and allowed the 13th. On August 30th the
district judge entered an order which treated the notice of
appeal filed July 12th as an application for allowance of
the appeal and granted it. That order recited that the
libellant had assumed that the clerk would present the
notice of appeal to the judge for an allowance, that the
judge knew within the three months' period of libellant's
intention to appeal and would have granted it if he had
been so requested, though he assumed a formal allowance
was not necessary. The Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the notice of appeal filed July 12th was sufficient as an
application for an appeal and that the failure to allow it
within the three months' period was not fatal. 141 F.
2d 652.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

323 U. S.

We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals. Application for an allowance of the appeal was of course necessary. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Pillsbury, 301 U. S. 174;
Wells v. United States, 318 U. S. 257, 260. But the law
does not prescribe the form in which an application for
allowance of an appeal must be cast. We cannot say that
the trial judge abused his discretion in treating the notice
of appeal as an application for -an allowance. It was
properly filed with the clerk of the District Court.2 Steftier v. United States, 319 U. S. 38, 40. The intention to
appeal was apparent. Only a formal request was lacking.
In other instances, where the scope of review was not affected, comparable irregularities in perfecting an appeal
have been disregarded in the interests of justice. Taylor
v. Voss, 271 U. S. 176, 182, and cases cited. We do not
suggest that the mere filing of a notice of appeal must be
taken as adequate. Desirable practice indicates that explicit instead of implied application for an allowance
should be made in order to avoid litigation. We hold,
however, that there is discretion to treat the notice of appeal as such an application.
Alaska Packers Assn. v. Pillsbury, supra, does not require a different result. In that case an appeal was sought
to be perfected simply by filing a notice of appeal. But
it did not appear that an appeal was ever allowed. The
Court held that an appeal must be applied for and allowed.
2 We therefore have a different question from that presented in
Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Prudence Group, 311 U. S. 579, 582,
where a notice of appeal was filed in the District Court but the appeal
had to be allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Here the appeal could be allowed either by the trial judge or by a
judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Pillsbury, supra; McCrone v. United States, 307 U. S. 61, 65; The Tietjen
& Lang No. 2, 143 F. 2d 711, 712; Judicial Code, § 132, 28 U. S. C.
§ 228.

Opinion of the Court.

It stressed the importance of the allowance in screening
out improper or premature appeals and in making certain
that security for costs was provided in appropriate cases.
301 U. S. p. 177. We adhere to that decision. Under this
statute an allowance of an appeal is essential. McCrone
v. UnitedStates, 307 U. S. 61. We only point out that the
Alaska Packers case did not involve the question presented
here, i. e., whether a notice of appeal may suffice as an
application for an allowance. Nor did it involve the further question whether the allowance must be made within

the three months' period. We held in Reconstruction
Finance Corp.v. PrudenceGroup, 311 U. S. 579, that a requirement of the Bankruptcy Act that certain appeals "be
taken to and allowed by the circuit court of appeals" within
a prescribed time was satisfied where the application was
timely but the allowance of the appeal came later. Otherwise "the existence of the right to appeal would be subject
to contingencies which no degree of diligence by an appellant could control." 311 U. S. at 582. That result is
even more plainly indicated under the present statute.

The Tietjen & Lang No. 2, 143 F. 2d 711. For where, as
here, a statute merely requires that an application for an
appeal be made within a prescribed time, the allowance
may be granted subsequently. Cardonav. Quinones, 240
U. S.83.
Affirmed.
