injunction and were therefore properly stricken with that
prayer. The allegations are not essential to or a proper
part of the cause of action for an accounting and recovery
of the royalties alleged to be due.
Since the allegations were stricken, appellee Federal
has answered setting up as a separate defense the royalty
adjustment orders prohibiting payment of the royalties
to appellant. Upon that issue appellant will be free to
contest the constitutional validity of the orders. The
judgment below is accordingly
Affirmed.

ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 46. Argued December 11, 1944.-Decided January 2, 1945.
Since the only question for the review of which certiorari was granted
in this case is one which was not properly raised, litigated, or passed
upon below, the writ is dismissed. P. 328.

OCTOBER TERM, 1944.
Opinion of the Court.

323 U. S.

PER CURIAM.
In this case both the District Court and the Ciruit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have held valid
and infrinked the Reilly and Stone Patent, No. 1,625,391,
of April 19, 1927, for a pipe cutting tool, of which patent
respondent Kammerer Corporation is assignee. The
patent expired on April 18, 1944, only damage for infringement is involved, and there is no conflict of decision
with respect to the patent. This Court granted certiorari
only because the petition for certiorari presented as a
ground of defense to the suit, that respondent Kammerer
Corporation had licensed to respondent Baash-Ross Tool
Company the use of the patented device in suit, by an
agreement which stipulated for restrictions on such use
which are asserted to be unauthorized by the patent
monopoly, contrary to public policy, and unlawful.
On oral argument and submission of the cause it appears that although petitioner by its amended answer
alleged generally that respondents "do not come into...
court with clean hands," the answer made no mention of
the restrictions contained in the license agreement. The
District Court made no findings of fact or law with respect
to them. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals petitioner assigned no error with reference to them and the
Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider them, saying:
"We affirm the judgments of the District Court, considering here only the appellant's claim of error." 138 F. 2d
482.
Thus the only question for which we granted certiorari
is one not properly raised, litigated or passed upon below.

NO. 68.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED

STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.*

Argued December 6, 1944.-Decided January 2, 1945.
1. Under ยง 266 of the Judicial Code, the jurisdiction of a district court

statewide application. P. 332.
2. The United States Housing Act of September 1, 1937, providing for

property acquired and owned by the United States, or an instrumentality thereof, pursuant to the United States Housing Act.
P. 333.
52 F. Supp. 906, affirmed.
143 Ohio St. 251, 55 N. E. 2d 265, reversed.
APPEALS, in Nos. 68 and 69, from a decree of a district
