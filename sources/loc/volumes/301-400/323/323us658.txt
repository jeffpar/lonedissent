Statement of the Case.

As we recognized in the Geist case, and were at pains
to point out, 316 U. S., at p. 96, such a case is within the
rule of United States v. National Surety Co., 254 U. S. 73,
76; Jenkins v. National Surety Co., 277 U. S. 258; American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Co., 296 U. S.
133, "that a solvent guarantor or surety of an insolvent's
obligation will not be permitted, either by taking indemnity from his principal or by virtue of his right of subrogation, to compete with other creditors payment of whose
claims he has undertaken to assure, until they are paid in

full."
MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE concurs in this opinion.

v. UNITED

STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 207.. Argued December 15, 1944.-Decided January 29, 1945.
Section 319 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by ยง 810 (a)
of the Revenue Act of 1932, provides that a claim for refund
of a federal estate tax "alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected must be presented to the Commissioner within
three years next after the payment of such tax." Held:
1. The period of limitations did not begin to run from the time
of a remittance which in effect was a deposit and which the Collector placed in a suspense account to the credit of the estate.
Pp. 661-662.
2. As to a balance of the remittance which was applied upon a
deficiency subsequently assessed by the Commissioner, a claim for
refund filed within three years of such application of the balance,
though more than three years from the date of the original remittance, was timely. P. 661.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. CharlesAngulo for petitioners.
Mr. Chester T. Lane argued the cause, and Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Samuel 0.
Clark, Jr., Messrs. Sewall Key, Walter J. Cummings, Jr.,
Miss Helen R. Carloss and Mrs. Elizabeth B. Davis were
on the brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an action upon a claim for refund of a federal
estate tax, and the specific question before us is whether
the claim was asserted too late. The matter is governed
by ยง 319 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 84, as
amended by ยง 810 (a) of the Revenue Act cf 1932, 47
Stat. 169, 282, 26 U. S. C. ยง 910, reading as follows:
"All claims for the refunding of the tax imposed by this
title alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected must be presented to the Commissioner within
three years next after the payment of such tax. The
amount of the refund shall not exceed the portion of the
tax paid during the three years immediately preceding
the filing of the claim, or if no claim was filed, then during
the three years immediately preceding the allowance of
the refund."
Petitioners are executors of the will of Louis Rosenman,
who died on December 25, 1933. Under appropriate
statutory authority, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue extended the time for filing the estate tax return to
February 25, 1935. But there was no extension of the
time for payment of the tax which became due one year
after the decedent's death, on December 25, 1934. The
day before, petitioners delivered to the Collector of Internal Revenue a check for $120,000, the purpose of which
was thus defined in a letter of transmittal: "We are delivering to you herewith, by messenger, an Estate check

payable to your order, for $120,000, as a payment on account of the Federal Estate tax. . . .This payment is
made under protest and duress, and solely for the purpose
of avoiding penalties and interest, since it is contended
by the executors that not all of this sum is legally or lawfully due." This amount was placed by the Collector in a
suspense account to the credit of the estate. In the books
of the Collector the suspense account concerns moneys received in connection with federal estate taxes and other
miscellaneous taxes if, as here, no assessment for taxes is
outstanding at the time. On February 25, 1935, petitioners filed their estate tax return according to which
there was due from the estate $80,224.24. On March 28,
1935, the Collector advised petitioners that $80,224.24 of
the $120,000 to their credit in the suspense account had
been applied in satisfaction of the amount of the tax
assessed under their return. On the basis of this notice,
petitioners, on March 26, 1938, filed a claim for $39,775.76,
the balance between the $120,000 paid by them under
protest and the assessed tax of $80,224.24.
Upon completion, after nearly three years, of the audit
of the return, the Commissioner determined that the total
net tax due was $128,759.08. No appeal to the Board of
Tax Appeals having been taken, a deficiency of $48,534.84
was assessed. The Collector thereupon applied the balance of $39,775.76 standing to the credit of petitioners
in the suspense account in partial satisfaction of this deficiency, and on April 22, 1938, petitioners paid to the
Collector the additional amount of $10,497.34, which
covered the remainder of the deficiency plus interest. The
Commissioner then rejected the petitioners' claim for refund filed in March of that year. On May 20, 1940, petitioners filed with the Collector a claim, based on additional deductions, for refund of $24,717.12. The claim
was rejected on the ground, so far as now relevant, that
the tax claimed to have been illegally exacted had been

paid more than three years prior to the filing of the claim,
except as to the amount of $10,497.34 paid by petitioners
in 1938. Petitioners brought this suit in the Court of
Claims which held that recovery for the amount here in
dispute was barred by statute, 53 F. Supp. 722. To resolve an asserted conflict of decisions in the lower courts
we brought the case here.
Claims for tax refunds must conform strictly to the
requirements of Congress. A claim for refund of an estate
tax "alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected must be presented to the Commissioner within
three years next after the payment of.such tax." On the
face of it, this requirement is couched in ordinary English,
and, since no extraneous relevant aids to construction have
been called to our attention, Congress has evidently meant
what these words ordinarily convey. The claim is for refund of a tax "alleged to have been erroneously or illegally
assessed or collected," and the claim must have been filed
"after the payment of such tax," that is, within three years
after payment of a tax which according to the claim was
erroneously or illegally collected. The crux of the matter
is the alleged illegal assessment or collection, and "payment of such tax" plainly presupposes challenged action
by the taxing officials.
The action here complained of was the assessment of a
deficiency by the Commissioner in April 1938. Before that
time there were no taxes "erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected" for the collection of which petitioners could
have filed a claim for refund. The amount then demanded
as a deficiency by the Commissioner was, so the petitioners
claimed, erroneously assessed. It is this erroneous assessment that gave rise to a claim for refund. Not until then
was there such a claim as could start the time running for
presenting the claim. In any responsible sense payment
was then made by the application of the balance credited
to the petitioners in the suspense account and by the ad-

ditional payment of $10,497.34 on April 22, 1938. Both
these events occurred within three years of May 20, 1940,
when the petitioners' present claim was filed.
But the Government contends "payment of such tax"
was made on December 24, 1934, when petitioners transferred to the Collector a check for $120,000. This stopped
the running of penalties and interest, says the Government, and therefore is to be treated as a payment by the
parties. But on December 24, 1934, the taxpayer did not
discharge what he deemed a liability nor pay one that was
asserted. There was merely an interim arrangement to
cover whatever contingencies the future might define.
The tax obligation did not become defined until April
1938. And this is the practical construction which the
Government has placed upon such arrangements. The
Government does not consider such advances of estimated
taxes as tax payments. They are, as it .were, payments in
escrow. They are set aside, as we have noted, in special
suspense accounts established for depositing money received when no assessment is then outstanding against
the taxpayer. The receipt by the Government of moneys
under such an arrangement carries no more significance
than would the giving of a surety bond. Money in these
accounts is held not as taxes duly collected are held but as
a deposit made in the nature of a cash bond for the payment of taxes thereafter found to be due. See Ruling of
the Comptroller General, A-48307, April 14, 1933, 1
(1935) Prentice-Hall Tax Service, Special Reports, paragraph 45. Accordingly, where taxpayers have sued for
interest on the "overpayment" of moneys received under
similar conditions, the Government has insisted that the
arrangement was merely a "deposit" and not a "payment"
interest on which is due from the Government if there is
an excess beyond the amount of the tax eventually assessed. See Busser v. United States, 130 F. 2d 537, 538;
Atlantic Oil Producing Co. v. United States, 35 F. Supp.

766; Moses v. United States, 28 F. Supp. 817; Chicago
Title & Trust Co. v. United States, 45 F. Supp. 323;
Estate of Rogers v. Commissioner, 1942 Prentice-Hall
B. T. A. Memorandum Decisions, paragraph 42,275. If it
is not payment in order to relieve the Government from
paying interest on a subsequently determined excess, it
cannot be payment to bar suit by the taxpayer for its illegal retention. It will not do to treat the same transaction as payment and not as payment, whichever favors
the Government. See United States v. Wurts, 303 U. S.
414.
Exaction of interest from the Government requires statutory authority, and it merely carries out the true nature
of an arrangement such as this to treat it as an estimated
deposit and not as a payment which, if in excess of what
should properly have been exacted, entitled the taxpayer
to interest as the return on the use that the Government
has had of moneys that should not have been exacted.
(We need not here consider the effect of the Current Tax
Payment Act of 1943, ยง 4 (d), 57 Stat. 126, 140.) On the
other hand, by allowing such a deposit arrangement, the
Government safeguards collection of the assessment of
whatever amount tax officials may eventually find owing
from a taxpayer, while the taxpayer in turn is saved the
danger of penalties on an assessment made, as in this case,
years after a fairly estimated return has been filed. The
construction which in our view the statute compels safeguards the interests of the Government, interprets a business transaction according to its tenor, and avoids gratuitous resentment in the relations between Treasury and
taxpayer.
Reversed.
