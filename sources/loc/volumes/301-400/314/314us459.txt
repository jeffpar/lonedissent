CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 57.

Argued December 11, 1941.-Decided December 22, 1941.

1. By the terms of the capital stock tax provisions of the Revenue Act
of 1935, an erroneous valuation of its capital stock made by a corporation in its "first return" can not be corrected by an amended
return filed more than 30 days after the statutory due date and
within the 60 days period for which an extension might have been
had under the statute and the Treasury Regulations, but where
no such extension was applied for or granted. P. 461.
2. In view of the express command of the statute, relief against such
a mistake can not be granted by a court of equity. P. 462..
117 F. 2d 572, affirmed.

CERTORARI, 313 U. S. 557, to review a judgment sus-

Mr. Samuel Kaufman, with whom Messrs. S. Leo Ru8-

lander and James M. Magee were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Richard H. Demuth, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and
Messrs. J. Louis Monarch and William L. Cary were on the
brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE DouGaAS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
On July 29, 1936, petitioner filed its capital stock tax 1

return for the period ended June 30, 1936.

This return

"See. 105 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1017, as
amended by ยง 401 of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1733,

was prepared by petitioner's treasurer and signed by petitioner's president. The treasurer had been instructed by
petitioner's vice-president to place upon the capital stock
a value of $1,000,000. By mistake the value was declared
at $600,000. This error was not noted by petitioner's
president when he signed the return. When the error was
later discovered, a new return was prepared declaring the
value of the stock to be $1,000,000. This return was
lodged with the Collector on September 3, 1936, and a
remittance of $400.00 to cover the additional capital stock
tax computed on the higher valuation was tendered. The
Collector refused to accept the amended return 2 and the
remittance of the additional $400.00. Petitioner then
filed a petition with the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of its excess profits tax' for 1936, claiming
tion with respect to carrying on or doing business for any part of such
year an excise tax of $1 for each $1,000 of the adjusted declared
value of its capital stock."
'Petitioner sought to enjoin the Collector from refusing to accept
the amended return. The bill was dismissed by the District Court.
Win. B. Scaife & Sons Co. v. Driscoll, 18 F. Supp. 748. The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed. 94 F. 2d 664. This Court denied certiorari. 305 U. S. 603.
*Sec. 106 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1019, provides:
"There is hereby imposed upon the net income of every corporation
for each income-tax taxable year ending after the close of the first
year in respect of which it is taxable under section 105, an excessprofits tax equal to the sum of the following:
"6 per centum of such portion of its net income for such income-tax
taxable year as is in excess of 10 per centum and not in excess of 15
per centum of the adjusted declared value;
"12 per centum of such portion of its net income for such income-tax
taxable year as is in excess of 15 per centum of the adjusted declared
value."
See. 106 (b) provides that the "adjusted ddclared value shall be
determined as provided in section 105 as of the close of the preceding
income-tax taxable year (or as of the date of organization if it had no
preceding income-tax taxable year)."

that that tax should be computed on the basis of a declared
value for its capital stock of $1,000,000. The Board sustained the action of the Commissioner. 41 B. T. A. 278.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 117 F. 2d 572.
We granted the petition for certiorari because of a conflict
between that holding and the decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Lerner Stores Corp. v.
Commissioner, 118 F. 2d 455.
Sec. 105 (f) of the Revenue Act of 1935 (49 Stat.
1014, 1018) provides that the adjusted declared value
of the taxpayer's capital stock shall be the value as declared in the "first return." The value so declared "cannot be amended." ยง 105 (f). The return must be made
within one month after the close of the year with respect
to which the tax is imposed. ยง 105 (d). While the Commissioner by rules and regulations "may extend the time
for making" the return, no extension shall be for more
than sixty days. ยง 105 (d). Under Art. 37 (b) of Treasury Regulations 64 (1936 ed.) an extension of time for
filing the return and paying the tax shall be granted only
upon written application under oath filed on or before
the statutory due date and on a showing of reasonable
cause for an extension. Petitioner sought no such extension. It did, however, file the amended return within
the sixty day period.
We agree with the court below that the amended return
was properly disallowed. A "first return" means a return
"for the first year in which the taxpayer exercises the
privilege of fixing its capital stock value for tax purposes,
and includes a timely amended return for that year."
Haggar Co. v. Helvering, 308 U. S. 389, 395. The return
filed on September 3,1936 was not timely. The statute is
not ambiguous. Once the period for filing the "first return" has expired, the value declared "cannot be
amended." Unless an extension had previously been obtained, the period for filing ended one month after the
close of the taxable year, which in .this case was June 30,

1936. Unlike the situation in Haggar Co. v. Helvering,
supra, the due date of the return had not been extended.
Nor did the statute make mandatory or automatic an
extension for sixty days. It merely gave the Commissioner the power to extend the due date under appropriate
rules and regulations. And the latter made no provision
for an extension after the expiration of the statutory
period. It is immaterial that different rules and regulations might have been promulgated under which an extension might have been obtained in the circumstances of
this case. The important consideration is that this
amended return was filed after the unextended or statutory due date had expired. In absence of an extension a
later due date would have no statutory sanction. See
J. E. Riley Investment Co. v. Commissioner, 311 U. S.
55. Furthermore, the mandate of the statute that the
declaration of value contained in the first return cannot
be amended must be taken to preclude an amendment
after the due date, if that prohibition is to have real
vitality.
But petitioner argues that a court of equity has power
to relieve against such mistakes. Cf. Moffett, Hodgkins
& Clarke Co. v. Rochester, 178 U. S. 373. Its contention
is that the amended return reflects its original intent
rather than a shift in position. But we cannot treat this
case like a case for reformation of a contract. We are
dealing here with an Act of Congress which not only prescribes the formula for determining the time within which
a return may be filed but which also explicitly states
that a declaration of value contained in the original return
may not be amended. Hence, no extension of the due
date may be had except pursuant to the procedure which
has clear statutory sanction. If we were to grant petitioner the extension which it asks, we would be performing
a legislative or administrative,' not a judicial, function.
'There are to be distinguished those cases adverted to in J. E. Riley
Investment Co. v. Commissioner, supra, p. 58, where the Treasury has

Syllabus.

The result in individual cases may be harsh. But that
may be true in case of any statute of limitations. As we
indicated in J. E. Riley Investment Co. v. Commissioner,
supra, such considerations, though a basis for an appeal to
Congress for relief in individual cases,' are not appropriate
grounds for relief by the courts from the strictness of
the statutory demand.
Affirmed.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 248. Argued December 11, 1941.--Decided December 22, 1941.
1. An amended capital stock tax return, to correct an undervaluation
of the taxpayer's capital stock declared by mistake in its "first
return," can not be filed after the lapse of 30 days from the statutory
due date and after the expiration of the period for which an extension might have been allowed by the Commissioner if application
for it had been made. &aife Company v. Commissioner, ante,
p. 459. P. 466.
provided for correction of certain errors or miscalculations in the
original returns. Such an example is Art. 43-2 of Treasury Regulations 86 providing for the filing of amended returns for the purpose
of deducting losses which were sustained during a prior taxable year.
'Thus Private Act No. 199, c. 440, 50 Stat. 1014, provides that the
original declared value of the Jackson Casket & Manufacturing Co.,
notwithstanding the declaration in its return for the year ending
June 30, 1936, should be a value computed on the basis of $125 per
share of its capital stock. From the Committee Reports it appears
that, due to a mistake by Western Union Telegraph Co. in transmitting
a message from the president of the company to its cashier, the latter
filed a return in which the value of the capital stock was declared
to be $175 per share, rather than $125 per share as the president
had directed. H. Rep. No. 777, 75th Cong., 1st Ses.; S. Rep. No.
