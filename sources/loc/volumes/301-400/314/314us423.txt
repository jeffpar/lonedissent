Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Melvin H. Siegel, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Shea, and Mr.
Paul A. Sweeney were on the brief, for the United States.
No appearance for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BYRNES delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case involves the application of § 3466 of the Revised Statutes to a claim of the United States under the
National Housing Act in an equity receivership proceeding
in a state court.
The St. James Distillery, a corporation, executed a note
to the Industrial Bank and Trust Company of St. Louis
on September 23, 1935. On July 14, 1936, the Bank endorsed the note and delivered it to the Federal Housing
Administration, acting on behalf of the United States,
under a contract of insurance and guaranty provided for
in Title I of the National Housing Act. The United States,
through the Federal Housing Administration, on that date
reimbursed the Bank in the amount of $5988.88, the balance due on the note. Emory, claiming wages due him,
filed a petition on August 27, 1936 in the Circuit Court
of Phelps County, Missouri, alleging that the St. James
Distillery was hopelessly insolvent and praying that a
receiver be appointed. On September 9, the Circuit Court
found all the issues in Emory's favor and appointed a
receiver who took possession of the corporate assets.
After deductions for the costs of the receivership, the
assets available for distribution totaled $678. Against this
amount the wage claims of "about twelve individuals"
were filed. The separate amounts of these claims were
neither stipulated nor determined by the courts below;
their aggregate was "about $900." The United States, on
behalf of the Federal Housing Administration, filed a
claim for the $5988.88 due on the note. The wage claim-

ants asserted priority under § 1168 of the Revised Statutes
of Missouri; 1 the United States asserted priority under
2
§ 3466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.
The Circuit Court of Phelps County decided that the
claim of the United States should be treated as an ordinary claim against the estate, and that the wage claims
should be paid first. On appeal, the Springfield Court of
Appeals held that the claim of the United States on behalf
of the Federal Housing Administration was accorded
preference over ordinary claims by § 3466 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States. Consequently, it was of the
opinion that the Circuit Court had erred in treating the
claim of the United States as an ordinary claim. However,
it held further that the error was of no consequence, since
the Missouri statute granted priority to wage claims even
over other preferred claims and no assets would remain
after they had been satisfied. Rehearing was denied, and
Mo. Rev. Stat. (1929) § 1168, so far as pertinent, provides: "Hereafter when the property of any company, corporation, firm or person
shall be seized upon by any process of any court of this state, or when
their business shall be . .. . put into the hands of a receiver or trustee,

then in all such cases the debts owing to laborers or servants, which have
accrued by reason of their labor or employment, to an amount not
exceeding one hundred dollars to each employee, for work or labor
performed within six months next preceding the seizure or transfer
of such property,

. .

.shall be first paid in full; and if there be not

sufficient to pay them in full, then the same shall be paid to them
pro rata, after paying the costs"'
'U. S. Rev. Stat. § 3466 (U. S. C., Title 31, § 191) provides: "Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever
the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased,
the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the
priority hereby established shall extend as well to cases in which a
debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a
voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of
an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process
of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed."

Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

the Supreme Court of Missouri denied a petition for certiorari. We granted certiorari because of the importance
of the question and because of an asserted conflict of
decisions.
The applicability of § 3466 to this case is clear. The section applies in terms to cases "[I] in which a debtor, not
having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or [2] in which the estate and
effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are
attached by process of law, . . . [or] [3] in which an act
of bankruptcy is committed." This case falls within the
third category. It is agreed that the St. James Distillery
was insolvent "on or before August 1936" and that in response to a creditor's petition a receiver was appointed to
liquidate the corporate assets. The appointment of a receiver under such circumstanceb is among the most common examples of an "act of bankruptcy." Cf. § 3 (a) (4)
of the Bankruptcy Act, U. S. C., Title 11, § 21 (a) (4).
Just such proceedings as this, therefore, are governed
by the plain command of § 3466 that "debts due to the
United States shall be first satisfied." The purpose of
this section is "to secure adequate public revenues to sustain the public burden" (United States v. State Bank of
North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35), and it is to be construed
liberally in order to effectuate that purpose (Bramwell v.
U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 269 U. S. 483, 487). In
-view of this language, purpose, and rule of construction,
the priority asserted here by the United States appears to
be securely established.
The court below, however, held otherwise. In granting
priority to the wage claims over that of the United States,
it relied upon Missouri law. It recognized, as the authorities obliged it to recognize,' that the state statute could

not prevail if it was in conflict with § 3466. But it decided
that no such conflict arose, for the reason that § 3466 had
been impliedly modified by § 64a of the Bankruptcy Act,'
which, like the Missouri statute, requires that wage claims
be satisfied before those of the United States.
The judgment below must have rested upon either of
the following theories: that Congress intended by § 64a
of the Bankruptcy Act to subordinate claims of the United
States to wage claims in non-bankruptcy proceedings generally; or that Congress intended by § 64a to modify § 3466
only so far as to grant priority over the United States to
wage claimants in state non-bankruptcy proceedings when
they would be entitled to such priority by otherwise applicable state law.
There is a difficulty common to both theories which
we regard as insurmountable. Neither the language of
§ 64a nor the Congressional history of the legislation here
involved supports the proposition that § 64a was intended
to eliminate, either partially or wholly, the priority
of claims of the United States in non-bankruptcy
proceedings.

Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

The provisions of § 3466 have been in force since 1797,
without significant modifications. 1 Stat. 515. The first
three federal bankruptcy acts ' specifically preserved the
priority of the United States over all other claimants in
bankruptcy proceedings in the federal courts. Section
64 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898,0 however, disturbed this
state of affairs. It provided an order of distribution of the
assets of bankrupt estates in which certain wage claims
preceded non-tax claims of the United States. While § 64
has been altered since 1898 in several particulars, the
priority of wage claims over non-tax claims of the United
States has continued. Consequently, we must look to
the Act of 1898 for evidence that the priority accorded to
wage claims by § 64 was intended to apply to more than
bankruptcy proceedings in the federal courts.
We find no such evidence. The entire Act of 1898, as
§ 2 in particular plainly reveals, was designed to create
federal courts of bankruptcy and to define their functions.
Indeed, § 64 itself, in subdivision (a), refers to the "court";
§,1 provides that, as used in the Act, "court" means "the

Act of 1867, c. 176, § 28, 14 Stat. 517.
'Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (30 Stat. 544) provided:
"(a) The court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due
and owing by the bankrupt to the United States, State, county, district,
or municipality in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors, and
upon filing the receipts of the proper public officers for such payment
he shall be credited with the amount thereof .. .
"(b) The debts to have priority, except as herein provided, and
to be paid in full out of bankrupt estates, and the order of payment
shall be (1) the actual and necessary cost of preserving the estate
subsequent to filing the petition; (2) the filing fees paid by creditors
in involuntary cases; (3) .. . [the costs of administration]; (4) wages
due to workmen, clerks, or servants which have been earned within
three months before the date of the commencement of proceedings, not
to exceed three hundred dollars to each claimant; and (5) debts owing
to any person who by the laws of the States or the United States is
entitled to priority."

court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending"; and § 1 also provides that "courts of bankruptcy,"
as used in the Act, mean the federal district courts and
a few other federal courts. There is no internal sign that
any part of § 64 was intended to apply to state courts or
to non-bankruptcygproceedings in the federal courts. We
have looked in vain in the committee reports and the
debate upon the bill for any external hint of such an
intention.
It is not strange, therefore, that both courts and commentators have assumed that the application of § 64 of
the Act of 1898 was limited to federal bankruptcy proceedings, and that the priority of claims of the United States in
non-bankruptcy proceedings remained unaffected. Brain,well v. U. S. Fidelity & GuarantyCo., 269 U. S. 483; Price

United States arising under it are not entitled to the priority awarded by § 3466. We are aware of no canon of statutory construction compelling us to hold that the word
"first" in a 150 year old statute means "second" or "third,"
unless Congress later has said so or implied it unmistakably.
Certainly, there is no provision in the National Housing
Act expressly relinquishing the priority of the United
States with respect to claims arising under it. At best,
therefore, such an intention on the part of Congress must
be found in some patent inconsistency between the purposes of the Housing Act and § 3466. The plain objective
of the Housing Act was to stimulate the building trades
and to increase employment. In order to induce banks
and other lending institutions to get the program under
way, Congress promised that the United States would
make good up to 20% on the losses they might incur on
such loans.' As between the Government and the lending
institutions, it was clearly intended that the United States
should bear the losses resulting from defaults. But beyond this we may not go. There is nothing to show a
further intention that the United States should relinquish
its priority as to claims against defaulting and insolvent
borrowers whose notes it takes up from the lending institution pursuant to the insurance contract. That is, the
ultimate collection of bad loans was consigned to the
United States rather than to the lending institutions, but
the collecting power of the United States was neither
abridged nor qualified.'
We are told, however, that the broad purposes of the
Act would be thwarted if we failed to assume that Con-

*48 Stat. 1246, c. 847, § 2.
'The priority granted by § 3466 is, of course, no guaranty that the
United States will be saved from loss. I the instant case, for example, the assets available for distribution are so small that the United
States will lose heavily even if its claim is first satisfied.

Opinion of the Court.

gress intended to surrender this priority. The reason
advanced is that suppliers of goods and services would
refuse to extend credit to those desiring to make property
improvements if they knew that in the event of insolvency
their claims would be subordinated to those of the United
States. The fatal weakness of this contention is that the
Federal Housing Administration imposes an ironclad requirement that the proceeds of insured loans be used for
no purpose other than the improvements described in the
application for the loan." Indeed, lending institutions
frequently pay the proceeds of the loan directly to the
suppliers of goods and services rather than to the property
owner, and the practice has met with the enthusiastic approval of the Administration."
Consequently, the argument against the application of
§ 3466 is reduced to this: Private persons in general are
reluctant to extend credit when they know that in the
event of the borrower's insolvency the claims of the United
States will receive priority, and this circumstance is particularly undesirable in times of economic stress. In the
first place, whatever may be the merits of the contention,
it should be addressed to Congress and not to this Court.
In the second place, the argument proves too much. If
it is sound as applied to this kind of a claim of the United
States, it is equally sound as applied to all claims as to
which the United States asserts priority under § 3466.

280 U. S. 478, requires a different conclusion. In the
former case, the United States was denied its § 3466 priority in connection with a claim against a national bank for
the amount of certain funds of the United States deposited
with it. The decision was based on two grounds. First,
the National Banking Act undertook to provide a complete
system for the establishment and government of banks,
and it included specific provisions concerning the distribution of the assets of insolvent banks which were plainly
inconsistent with the granting of priority to general claims
of the United States. Second, the National Banking Act
expressly authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to require national banks accepting deposits of federal funds to
give satisfactory security; it was held to be fairly inferable that Congress intended the United States to look to
this provision rather than to § 3466 for protection.
The claims which were denied priority in the Guaranty
Trust case arose under Title II of the Transportation Act
of 1920. That Act provided for the funding of debts to
the United States which the railroads had contracted during the period of wartime control, and also provided for
new loans to the railroads. In holding § 3466 inapplicable
to the collection of these loans the Court emphasized that
the basic purpose of the Act was to promote the general
credit status of the railroads, that the railroads were required to furnish adequate security for the payment of
both the old and new loans, and that the interest rate of
6% on one class -of loans was "much greater than that
which ordinarily accompanies even a business loan carrying such assurance of repayment as would have resulted
from an application of the priority rule." 280 U. S. at
486. These factors persuaded the Court that Congress
had intended to exclude these loans from the scope of
§ 3466.
In the instant case, none of these circumstances is
present. The National Housing Act contains no refer-

ence to the liquidation of estates of insolvent borrowers,
and consequently no direct inconsistency with § 3466 is
possible. The purpose of Title I was not the strengthening of the general credit of property owners, but the stimulation of the building trades by affording assurances to
lending institutions in order to induce them to make loans
for property improvements. No security was required of
the borrowers, and the interest charge was low.12 Only
the plainest inconsistency would warrant our finding an
implied exception to the operation of so clear a command
as that of § 3466. We think such inconsistency is wholly
wanting here.
Section 3466 is applicable to this proceeding, and it requires that the claim of the United States be first
satisfied.

primarily to meet operating expenses under Title I and secondarily

that $4,000,000 of public funds would be required to meet the balance.

Statutes is inapplicable to the claim of the Administrator

in this case.
A statute is not to be interpreted by its text alone, as
though it were a specimen under laboratory control. It
takes meaning from other enactments forming the whole
body of law bearing upon its subject.' If, like § 3466,
it has been upon the books for years, the precedents interpreting its meaning must be considered in connection
with it, particularly when, as here, new legislation is
passed which may be inconsistent with its application.'
From past interpretation we learn that the traditional
function of § 3466 is the assurance of the public revenue,"
whatever may be the expense to the competing creditors.
Their interests are subordinated to the general advantage.6

Title I of the National Housing Act, however, is not a
revenue measure-it was intended to stimulate recovery
and employment in the construction industries and to
enable property-owners to obtain funds for sorely needed
repairs by insuring financial institutions against loss on
loans for such work.' This was accomplished by what is,
in effect, a guarantee that all losses on rehabilitation loans,
up to a predetermined percentage (20% here) of the
total made by the financial institution, would be borne
by the United States, either by taking over loans in default or paying the deficit.' That loss Congress intended
the Government to bear.9 In estimating the loss, it relied

§ 3466 under those circumstances would shift the loss
from the Government to competing creditors, thus hampering the efforts of private business and capital to
achieve that economic recovery which was the aim of the
legislation.11
Nothing in the hearings, the debates or the Act show
definitively that Congress considered the application of
§ 3466 to government claims under the National Housing
Act. If the two acts alone were to be appraised, it might
well be concluded that, as they are not necessarily inconsistent, both should be enforced. But the determination of Congressional purpose is not so simple as that.
Upon the assumption that the applicability of § 3466
never came to the attention of Congress, we must find
legislative purpose not from the language of the two Acts
alone but from generalizations as to the object of the
new statute and from judicial interpretations of the meaning of the old. To reach a sound conclusion as to the
applicability of the priority statute and the purpose of
Congress deduced merely from the state of the law at
the time of the enactment of the Housing Act, we need to
weigh the precedents under § 3466 quite as carefully as
the Acts themselves, in order to develop the legal situation

Section 3466 is incon-

sistent with this purpose.1' It is not significant that in
the case of Cook County NationalBank the debtor bank
against which priority was denied was in the federal financial system, while here the debtor is a private corporation
which has participated in a federal financing plan. The
intrusion of a novel priority, uncertain in amount because
unrecorded, into the intricate credit system of the Nation
at a time of strain, would be a drag on recovery, rather
than a stimulus. Suppliers of goods or services in all fields
of credit activity would be moved to constrict their advances to a borrower known to have created a secret but
valid lien upon his assets superior to all general creditors.
The full reach of the implication of credit dislocation may
be readily gauged by the fact that, at the end of 1936,
1,326,102 separate rehabilitation loans had been made
under Title I for an aggregate amount of $500,220,642.1"

Possible priorities will now exist for every outstanding
dollar.
The facts of this case show how government aid to a
debtor may be a snare for his other creditors if the priority
statute operates in this class of claims. About a dozen
claimants became creditors in the aggregate amount of
some nine hundred dollars for labor. Such labor claims
were entitled to the preference under Missouri law common to labor claims. But for the priority of the Government's claim, they would receive all of the realization
from the assets-about two-thirds of their claims. But a
month before the appointment of the receiver, the Federal
Housing Administration took over from a bank a note of
about $6000. From a deferred position in the hands of
the bank, this debt is said to have stepped into a preferred
position by transfer to the government agency. As such,
it absorbs all of the assets, and the laborers who trusted
their employer's credit get nothing. Such a preference of
creditors, brought about by the debtor,, would be an act
of bankruptcy.
In 1920, when the railroads needed funds but lacked
credit for private borrowing, government loans were
authorized by Congress, based upon such prospective
earning power and security as would furnish reasonable
assurance of repayment."6 In United States v. Guaranty
Trust Co., 280 U. S. 478, we held that the rehabilitating
functions and the security provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920 were so inconsistent with § 3466 as to preclude its application mi the receivership of a debtor railroad. Even more inconsistent considerations exist in this'
case. Congress was confronted with widespread need of
repairs on property owned by persons without the cash or
credit to secure them." Moreover, not only homeowners

but, like the railroads, hard pressed business establishments, such as the distillery in this case, were to be assisted
in securing modernization loans. 8 Instead of lending
these people federal funds, Congress lent them federal
credit on which to borrow private funds, with the evident
purpose of keeping the program as much as possible a
matter of private enterprise handled in the course of private affairs. Assurance of repayment was rested not on a
combination of security and earning power but deliberately upon earning power alone. 9 Whereas, with the railroads, interest corresponding to the risk was charged, no
premium was charged for the insurance of loans under
Title I,--with the expectation that the Government would
pay the loss as its contribution to recovery.' The declared purpose of the United States to absorb the losses of
the lenders is clearly inconsistent with the priority over
other creditors given by § 3466. It seems beyond doubt,
to me, that Congress did not expect a priority under
Title I which the GuarantyTrust case certainly denied it
under Title II relating to insured mortgages.2
Even in the mechanics of its operation, Title I repudiated the benefits of § 3466. Collection was left to the

no priority.
The judgment should be affirmed on the ground that no

'Modernization Credit Plan, Bulletin No. 1, supra, at p. 8 states:
"It is to the interest of the financial institution to carry the collection
process on a defaulted note as far as there is reasonable prospect of
ultimate payment inasmuch as complete reimbursement for any expenses incurred is provided as specified hereinafter,. This' policy will
tend to conserve the insurance reserve of 20% for possible later losses
and also will maintain the understanding of the local community that
these notes require the same prompt handling by makers as any other
credit obligation .... it is the policy of the Federal Housing Administration to permit financial institutions every possible latitude in
making collections on delinquent items. It is only after it clearly
appears that further collection efforts will be fruitless that the Federal
Housing Administration will insist that claim be made. Financial
institutions are, therefore, given a full year after default on the note
to effect collection. . . . If 10% of the amount due on the note is
collected within the first year after default on the note and so long
thereafter as 5% at least is collected in each six-month period, the
Federal Housing Administration will not require that claim be made,
but will permit the financial institution to proceed with its collection
efforts. Claims may include: (1) Net unpaid principal; (2) uncollected earned interest (after maturity interest is not to be claimed at
a rate exceeding 6% per annum); -(3) uncollected 'late charges'; (4)
uncollected court costs, including fees paid for issuing, serving and
filing summons; (5) attorney's fees not exceeding 15% of the amount
collected on the defaulted note; (6) handling fee of $5 for each note,
if judgment is secured, plus 5% of amount collected subsequent to
return of unsatisfied property execution."
