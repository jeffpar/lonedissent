stitution pledges his strength to the defense of California
as a part of the United States, and his right to migrate to
any part of the land he must defend is something she must

is willing to say that citizenship of the United States means
at least this much to the citizen, then our heritage of

UNITED STATES v. KALES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 35.

Argued November 14, 1941.-Decided December 8, 1941.

1. A taxpayer who had paid a 1919 income tax on the profits of a sale
of stock computed on the basis of a March 1, 1913, valuation of
the stock sold, and who later had been subjected by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to a jeopardy assessment for an additional
tax on the profits of the same transaction computed upon a lower
1913 valuation, paid the additional tax and accompanied the payment with a letter protesting against it upon the ground that the
Commissioner had no authority to reopen and set aside the 1913
valuation as made by his predecessor, but also asserting that the
first 1913 valuation was itself too low, and that if it were to be
set aside by administrative action, or in the courts, the taxpayer
would insist that the earlier tax was therefore excessive and would
claim a refund of the excess paid. Held, that the letter sufficed as a
claim to stay the running of the statute of limitations on the taxpayer's right to a refund of an excess in the earlier tax. P. 193.
2. A notice fairly advising the Commissioner of the nature of the
taxpayer's claim, which the Commissioner could reject because
too general or because it does not comply with formal requirements
of the statute and regulations, will nevertheless be treated as a claim
where formal defects and lack of specificity have been remedied by
amendment filed after the lapse of the statutory period. This is

especially the case where such a claim has not misled the Conmnissioner and he has accepted and treated it as such. P. 194.
3. Treatment by the taxing authorities of the informal claim and

its later amendment' as a claim for, refund operated as a waiver of
regulations prescribing the formality and particularity with which

grounds for a refund are required to be stated. P. 196.
4. A judgment against a Collector of Internal Revenue refunding
1919 income taxes collected by him in 1925 does not bar a later
suit against the United States to recover an-excess of tax on income
for the same year, paid to a different Collector in 1920. P. 197.

Argument for Respondent.

314 U. S.

The suit is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The
earlier litigation dealt with the basis of the Ford stock,
and the refund sought herein turns upon the basis for
the identical shares.
The former suit in this case against the Collector was
in substance a suit against the Government. See Elliott
v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137; Barney v. Watson, 92 U. S.
449, 452; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co., 18 How.
272, 275; Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236; Curtis's Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 478; Arnson v. Murphy,
109 U. S. 238, 240.
To the extent that Sage v. United States, 250 U. S. 33,
seems-to reach a different result, it is plainly out of line
with Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373. In
any event, the Sage case is distinguishable. There, the
rights which were the subject matter of the second suit
had not been the subject of prior litigation. The case
has been regarded as resting upon the particular legislation involved. Second National Bank of Saginaw v.
Woodworth, 54 F. 2d 672, 673, aff'd 66 F. 2d 170; Cudahy
Packing Co. v. Harrison, 18 F. Supp. 250, 254, appeal
dismissed, 102 F. 2d 981. See, also, Griswold, Res Judicatain FederalTax Cases,46 Yale L. J. 1320, 1341-1342.
Mr. Hal H. Smith, with whom Messrs. Archibald
Broomfield and Laurence A. Masselink were on the
brief, for respondent.
The 1925 letter constituted an informal claim for
refund of taxes overpaid in 1920.
The word "claim" is interpreted liberally in determining the application of statutes of limitation. Factors & Finance Co. v., United States, 56 F. 2d 902, 905,

Opinion of the Court.

By retaining and treating the 1925 letter as a claim
for refund for a period of over ten years, the Commissioner waived any and all defects of form contained
therein. United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U. S.
528; Georgia, F. & A. Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., 241
U. S. 190; Tucker v. Alexander, 275 U. S. 228. See,
also, United States v. Elgin National Watch Co., 66 F. 2d
344; UnitedStates v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 69 F. 2d
214; Reynolds v. McMurray, 77 F. 2d 740.
The taxpayer has not split a cause of action. Old
Colony Ry. Co. v. United States, 27 F. 2d 994; Cambridge Loan & Building Co. v. United States, 57 F.
2d 936.
The rule of res judicata can be applied only
when the
two suits in question are between the same parties or
their privies. Then the question is whether the second
suit is on the same demand as was the first. If the
second suit is on a different demand, then the first
judgment is conclusive on the parties only as to the
point there actually litigated and determined. Here the
second suit is not on the same demand. Sage v. United
States, 250 U. S.33.
The doctrine of the Sage case has been consistently
followed by this Court. It has been relied on to protect
the rights, or further the interests, of the Government.

& Foster v. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 430; Bankers Coal

by respondent taxpayer and lodged with the Commissioner, a claim for refund of overpaid taxes so as to stop the
running of the statute of limitations against the claim?
Second, did a judgment, refunding taxes paid to the collector in 1925 upon profits from the sale of certain shares
of stock in 1919, bar a later suit for a further recovery of
1919 taxes, overpaid in 1920 to a different collector upon
profits from the same transaction?
In 1919, respondent was the owner of 525 shares of the
stock of the Ford Motor Company which she had acquired
before March 1, 1913. In anticipation of the. sale of the
stock, she requested and obtained, in 1919, from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, a ruling that the March
1st, 1913, value of the stock was $9,489 per share. She
then sold .the stock for $12,500 a share, and reported in
her income tax return for 1919 the profit over the March 1,
1913 value thus established. In 1920, she paid the tax so
computed, amounting to $1,216,086, to Collector Grogan,
since. deceased.
In March, 1925, tle Commissioner made a jeopardy deficiency assessment against respondent for an increase of
-profit on the sale of the stock in 1919, on the ground that
respondent had overstated the 1913 value of the stock in
her 1919 tax return. Respondent paid the additional
assessment, amounting to $2,627,309, to Collector Woodworth on March 24, 1925. At the same time, she lodged
with the collector and the Commissioner a written protest,
dated March 23, 1925, against the jeopardy assessment on
the ground, among others, that the Commissioner was
without authority in law to reopen and set aside the 1913
valuation of the stock as determined in 1919 by the then,
Commissioner, on the basis of which respondent had sold'
her stock. By paragraph 9 of the protest, respondent also
adv'ised the collector, the Commissioner and the Government that, while it was respondent's position that the
deficiency assessment was illegal and void for this and

186

Opinion of the Court.

other reasons stated, if the Internal Revenue Department,
the Board of Tax Appeals or any court having jurisdiction
should hold that the assessment of March 1, 1913 value of
her stock, made in 1919, should be vacated, set aside, reopened or reversed, then respondent would insist that the
valuation fixed by the Commissioner in 1919 was less than
'the fair market value as of March 1, 1913, that the 1919
tax which she had paid in 1920 was correspondingly excessive, and that she should recover the tax to the extent of
such excess when the fair value had been determined.
She added in paragraph 10 that "if for any reason a revaluation shall be had," she "will insist" that the stock
was greatly undervalued by the Department and "will
claim the right to a refund" of the excess tax collected.
After a claim duly filed for refund of the amount of the
jeopardy assessment, paid in 1925, respondent brought suit
in the district court against Collector Woodworth, which
resulted in a judgment for the taxpayer for the full amount
of the assessment with interest. The Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment,
Woodworth v. Kales, 26 F. 2d 178, which was satisfied in
November, 1928.
September 24, 1928, respondent filed a formal claim for
refund of the taxes paid in 1919, stated to be an amendment of the claim for refund contained in her letter of
protest of March 23, 1925. By the amendment, respondent sought an additional refund of income taxes, paid for
the year 1919, in the amount of $195,710 with interest,
upon the ground that the Ford stock, as the Board of Tax
Appeals had then determined in James Couzens, 11
B. T. A. 1040, had a March 1, 1913 value of $10,000 per
share, and that she should accordingly have the benefit of
this higher basis in computing her profit. At a hearing
granted by the General Counsel for the Bureau of Internal
Revenue on June 13, 1929, the amended claim was considered on the merits. Again, in January, 1933, a mem-

ber of his staff, at a conference with respondent's attorney,
advised the latter that the informal claim was filed in
time and was good as an informal claim.
By letter of June 4, 1935, however, the Commissioner
declined to act upon it, on the single ground that because
respondent's judgment for refund of the jeopardy assessment for 1919 taxes had been satisfied "the Bureau is
precluded from giving further consideration in any respect
to the matter of your income tax liability for the taxable
year 1919." This was followed by the Deputy Commissioner's letter of August 20, 1935, to respondent, stating
that "the refund claim filed in 1925 was merged into the
judgment . . . and you were, therefore, precluded from
filing an amendment to the earlier claim which had been
finally adjudicated." The letter added "The adjudication by the court removed this matter from the realm of
administrative action other than to make refund as directed by the judgment."
Collector Grogan having retired from office
and having
died, the present suit for refund of the overpayment of
the tax claimed was brought in the district court against
the United States under the provisions of § 1122 (c) of the
Revenue Act of 1926. This section authorizes suits in the
district court for the refund of overpayment of revenue
taxes, even if in excess of $10,000, to be brought against
the United States, where the collector to whom the overpayment was made is dead or is not in office when the
suit is brought. The judgment of the district court dismissing the suit on motion was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, 115 F. 2d 497, which held that the letter
of March 23, 1925, was a timely informal claim for refund
which had been perfected by the formal amended claim
filed in September, 1928, that consequently the respondent's cause of action was not barred by limitation and that
recovery was not precluded by the previous judgment for
recovery of the jeopardy assessment for 1919. We granted

UNITED STATES v' KALES.
186

Opinion of the Court.

certiorari, 313 U. S. 553, upon petition of the Government,
which urged that any further recovery for overpayment
of the 1919 tax was barred by the judgment in the respondent's suit and recovery of the jeopardy assessment
for that year, a question of importance in the administration of the revenue laws. The Government urges as
grounds for reversal that, if respondent's letter of March
23, 1925 be considered a claim for refund, any recovery is
barred by the 1928 judgment, and that in any event the
letter was not a claim for refund and does not support
the present suit.
First. Concededly, recovery of the 1919 tax, paid in 1920,
is not barred by limitation if respondent's letter of March
23, 1925, be treated as a claim for refund. The Collector
of Internal Revenue extended the respondent's time to
make return of her 1919 income taxes for thirty days from
March 15, 1920, and her letter was placed with the Commissioner within five years of the expiration of the extended time. Section 284 (h) of the 1926 Revenue Act,
44 Stat. 9, provides that a claim for refund of 1919 taxes
shall not be barred by a lapse of time if filed within five
years from the date when the return was due. Revised
Statutes § 3226, 26 U. S. C. § 1672, makes the filing of a
claim for refund in accordance with the law and Treasury
regulations a condition precedent to suit to recover it.
Article 1306 of Treasury Regulations 65, promulgated
under the 1924 Revenue Act and applicable here, provides
that claims for refund shall be made upon Form 843,
setting forth all the facts relied on under oath. But Treasury Decision 4266, promulgated March 27, 1929, authorizes the Commissioner to make a refund after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation, even though no
formal claim has been filed before that time, in any case in
which an informal or defective claim, duly filed prior to
the expiration of the period of limitation and stating
specifically the grounds for the refund, is perfected by
the filing of a claim prior to May 1, 1929.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

.This Court, applying the statute and regulations, has
often held that a notice fairly advising the Commissioner
of the nature of the taxpayer's claim, which the Commissioner could reject because too, general or because it does
not comply with formal requirements of the statute and
regulations, will nevertheless be treated as a claim, where
formal defects and lack of specificity have been remedied
by amendment filed after the lapse of the statutory
period. United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., 288
U. S. 62; United States v. Factors& Finance Co., 288 U. S.
89; Bemis Bro. Bag Co. v. United States, 289 U. S. 28;
Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 384. This is
especially the case where such a claim has not misled
the Commissioner and he has accepted and treated it as
such. Bonwit Teller& Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 258;
United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra, 70.
In applying these guiding principles to the case in hand,
it is necessary to read the letter of March 23, 1925, in the
light of the peculiar circumstances then well known to the
Commissioner and referred to in the letter. The letter
dealt with two distinct subjects. One was the jeopardy
assessment which the taxpayer was about to pay and did
in fact pay to the collector on the following day when the
letter in duplicate was given to the collector and the Commissioner. The other, stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of
the letter, related to the liability of the Government for
overpayments of 1919 taxes made to Collector Grogan in
1920, in the event that the Commissioner's 1919 assessment of the Ford stock should be set aside by the courts or
administrative action. In that event, the letter recites
that the 1919 valuation was too low, the tax paid in 1920
was too high, and asserts the taxpayer's consequent "right
to a refund of said tax to the extent of such excess."
The letter states correlative alternative rights on which
the taxpayer relied. One was the challenge to the validity

UNITED STATES v. KALES.
186

Opinion of the Court.

of the 1925 jeopardy assessment on the ground that the
-appraisal in 1919 of the then Commissioner was unalterable. The other was respondent's right to a refund of
taxes paid in 1920 in the event that the 1919 appraisement
of the stock should be set aside by the Bureau or be determined to be erroneous. Whether the Commissioner
would insist upon changing the 1919 appraisal of her stock,
and whether in any case the Board of Tax Appeals would
find a different 1913 value for the stock, were matters for
future determination. When respondent filed her letter,
the time within which a claim for refund could be filed was
about to expire, and the occurrence of the contingencies on
which a recovery could be had by respondent remained un certain. But the Commissioner could have been left in
no doubt that she was setting forth her right to a refund in
the event of a departmental revision of its 1919 valuation
of her stock. Her letter was present notice that, if'the
department insisted upon changing its original decision as
to the 19i3 value, she asserted that the stock had been
undervalued and in consequence of. the undervaluation
she had a "right to a refund of said [1919] tax to the extent of such excess." Her concluding paragraph made
the like assertion "if for any reason a revaluation shall be
had" of the Ford stock. At that time, the Commissioner
had assessed deficiencies aggregating $31,000,000 against
former Ford stockholders who had sold stock which they
had acquired before March 1, 1913. See James Couzens,
11 B. T. A. 1043-4. Respondent's amended formal claim
of September 11, 1928, only made more specific the allegations of her earlier informal claim by stating that the
Board of Tax Appeals had found the 1913 value of the
stock to be $10,000 per share, and by computing the excess tax, the right to which had been asserted in the
earlier claim.
The fact that respondent had originally stated her claim
in the future tense, saying that in the event of depart-

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

mental revision of the valuation of the stock she "will
insist" on a higher valuation and "will claim the right to a
refund," does not, in the circumstances of this case, lend
even grammatical support to the Government's contention. Such a use of the future tense in stating a claim
may, with due regard to the circumstances of making it,
rightly be taken as an assertion of a present right. See
Georgia,F. & A. Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., 241 U. S. 190,
197-8; cf. Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra, 384, reversing 61 F. 2d 605. Here the claim is alternative and
contingent upon future events. The statement that upon
the happening of the contingency the claim will be prosecuted is not inconsistent with the present assertion of it.
It is indeed an appropriate, if not the necessary, phraseology for the present assertion of an alternative claim with
respect to which a taxpayer, in his presentation of an informal tax refund claim, should be in no less favorable
position than the plaintiff in a suit at law who is permitted
to plead his cause of action in the alternative. See Rule
8 (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; United
States v. Richards, 79 F. 2d 797.
If the point were more doubtful than we think it is, it
would be resolved by the consistent administrative treatment of respondent's letter of March 23, 1925, and the
later amendment as a claim for refund. Neither the original nor the amended claim has ever been rejected as inadequate by the Commissioner or the Bureau. There has
been no objection to the claim on the ground that it was
informal, deficient in its content, or untimely. Acknowledgment of the letter of March 23, 1925, by the Commissioner referred to the jeopardy assessment, but made no
mention of the asserted right to refund of taxes paid in
1920. After the amendment was filed in September, 1928,
the claim was held under advisement by the Bureau for
nearly seven years. As we have said, it was consistently
treated in correspondence by the Bureau and at hearings

UNITED STATES v. KALES.
186

Opinion of the Court.

during this period as a claim for refund. The Commissioner finally, by his letters of June 4, 1935 and August 25,
1935, declined to consider the claim on the sole ground
that it was no longer a subject of administrative action
because "the refund claim filed in 1925 was merged into
the judgment" for refund of the tax paid on the jeopardy
assessment. Not only do we think that this entire course
of departmental action was an administrative construction
of respondent's letter of March 23, 1925, conforming to our
own interpretation of its words, but we think it was a
waiver of the requirements of the regulations as to the
formrality and particularity with which the grounds for
refund are required to be stated. Bonwit Teller & Co. v.
United States, supra,264; United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., supra, 288 U. S. at p. 70; cf. Tucker v. Alexander,275 U. S. 228, 231; United States v. GarbuttOil Co.,
302 U. S. 528, 533.
Second. The Government argues that the right to recover for overpayment of income taxes in any tax year
constitutes a single cause of action against the Government, and that the present suit by the respondent, seeking recovery of 1919 taxes, after having recovered the
amount of the jeopardy assessment for the same year,
involved an inadmissible splitting of her cause of action.
In any event, it insists that no cause of action for recovery of overpayment of 1919 taxes could survive the recovery of the amount of the jeopardy assessment, since the
judgment for that recovery merged all claims for overpayment of 1919 taxes and so foreclosed the present suit
for additional overpayments of taxes growing out of the
same transaction.
But we think these contentions disregard the statutory
scheme which has bcen set up for the recovery from an
internal revenue collector, of taxes which he had unlawfully collected. See Sage v. United States, 250 U. S.33.
Originally, payment under protest to an internal revenue

314 U. S.

collector of illegally exacted taxes gave rise to a common
law cause of action against the collector for restitution
of the overpayment. Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137,
153, 156; Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra, 375, and
cases cited. By the protest the collector was informed of
the contention of the taxpayer and was thus precluded
from relieving himself, by payment into the Treasury of
the moneys collected, from liability to make restitution.
Elliott v. Swartwout, supra; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel
Co., 257 U. S. 1, 4. By a series of Congressional acts it was
made the duty of the collector to pay to the Government
the moneys collected, regardless of a protest. 12 Stat. 442;
13 Stat. 483; R. S. § 3210; 26 U. S. C. § 1761. But with imposition of this duty on the collector to pay over, the Government undertook to indemnify him upon certification
by the court, either that there was probable cause for the
act done by the collector, or that he acted under directions
of the Secretary of the Treasury or other proper officers
of the Government. 12 Stat. 741, § 12. In that event,
no execution was to issue against him, but the amount
of recovery, was to be paid out of the Treasury. These
provisions, carried into Revised Statutes § 989, are con-'
tinued as 28 U. S. C. § 842. By § 1014 of the Revenue Act
of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, amending Revised Statutes
§ 3226, the requirement for protest of the payment was
abolished.
While the effect of the certificate in indemnifying the
collector has been said to convert the suit against him into
a suit against the Government, at least so far as the ultimate incidence of the liability is concerned, UnitedStates
v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 565, 567; Moore Ice Cream Co. v.
Rose, supra, 289 U. S. at p. 381, the statutory proVisions
have not altered the nature and extent of the claims which
the taxpayer is authorized to prosecute in suits against the
collector. Originally it was the payment of the illegally
exacted tax which gave rise to the cause of action. It

UNITED STATES v. KALES.
186

Opinion of the Court.

was the payment which designated the person against
whom the suit might be brought and which measured the
right of recovery. - Payments made to one collector could
not be recovered from another, and, since the causes of
action against the two collectors were different, recovery
upon one could not bar recovery upon the other.
After the enactment of legislation requiring collectors
of customs to pay over to the Government duties collected
under protest, 5 Stat. 348; R. S. § 3010, doubts arose
whether suit could, in such circumstances, be maintained
against them, since it was thought that the statutory command had relieved the collectors from personal liability.
See Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 235. But those doubts were
put at rest by later acts of Congress establishing the continued right of the taxpayer to maintain a suit against
such a collector notwithstanding payment over of his collections to the Treasury. 5 Stat. 727; R. S. § 3011; Curtis's
Administratrix v. Fiedler, 2 Black 461, 479; Arnson v.
Murphy, 109 U. S. 238, 241. A like uncertainty as to the
effect of the statutes requiring internal revenue collectors
to pay moneys collected to the Government was resolved
by this Court's decisions in Phi::adelphiav. Collector, 5
Wall. 720, 731; Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 13. As
Congress had enacted provisions for indemnification of
the collector by the Government, the implication necessarily arose that the taxpayer could maintain an action
against him. See 12 Stat. 434, 729, 741; 13 Stat. 239.
The right of action thus continued is identical with that
which existed before Congress had acted. Notwithstanding the provision for indemnifying the collector and protecting him from execution, the nature and extent of the
right asserted and the measure of the recovery remain
the same. It was payment to the collector which gave
rise to the suit against him and limited the amount of
the recovery. The judgment against the collector is a
personal judgment, to wl-ich the United States is a

Sage v. United States, supra;Smietanka v. IndianaSteel
Co., supra,4, 5.
While the statutes have for most practical purposes
-reduced the personal liability of the collector to a fiction,
the course of the legislation indicates clearly enough that
it is a fiction intended to be acted upon to the extent that
the right to maintain the suit and its incidents, until
judgment rendered, are to be left undisturbed. Among
its incidents is the right to a jury trial, which is not available in suits against the United States. 28 U. S. C.
§ 41 (20).
By no possibility could the respondent in the suit
brought against Collector Woodworth in 1925 recover taxes
paid to Collector Grogan in 1920, which she demands here.
Recovery from one collector of the payment to him does
not bar recovery on the different cause of action arising
upon*payment to the other, even though the two collections are for taxes arising out of the same transaction.

Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 308; cf. Graham& Fosterv. Goodcell, 282 U. S. 409, 430; Sunshine Coal Co. v. A dkins, 310
U. S. 381, 403. The right to pursue the common law
action against the collector is too deeply imbedded in the
statutes and judicial decisions of the United States to admit of so radical a departure from its traditional use and
consequences as the Government now urges, without
further Congressional action.
