-Opinion of the Court.

for the District of New Jersey. The basis of this application is petitioner's allegation that a vessel and its cargo
of oil, the subject of litigation in the District Court and
now in its possession, are the property of the Italian Government and are entitled to the benefit of Italy's sovereign
immunity from suit.
After the motion was filed, there occurred on December
11, 1941, the declaration that the United States is at war
with Italy. Section 2 (b) of the Trading with the Enemy
Act, 40 Stat. 411, defines "enemy" to include the government of any nation with which the United States is at
war. Section 7 (b) contains the following provision, 40
stat. at 417:
"Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to authorize the
prosecution of any suit or action at law or in equity in any
court within the United States by an enemy or ally of
enemy prior to the end of the war, except as provided in
section ten hereof" [which relates to patent, trademark
and copyright suits] ". . And provided further,That an
enemy or ally of enemy may defend by counsel any suit
in equity or action at law which may be brought against
him."
This provision was inserted in the Act in the light of the
principle, recognized by Congress and by this Court, that
war suspends the right of enemy plaintiffs to prosecute
actions in our courts. See S. Repts. Nos. 111 and 113, pp.
21, 24, 65th Cong., 1st Sess.; Capertonv. Bowyer, 14 Wall.
216, 236; Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 536-37, 539;
Mastersonv. Howard, 18 Wall. 99, 105; Porterv. Freudenberg, [1915] 1 K. B. 857, 866-80. In view of the statute
and the opinions in the cases cited, the application will not
be entertained. Cf. Rothbarthv. Herzfeld, 179 App. Div.
865, 867-69, 167 N. Y. S. 199, affirmed 223 N. Y. 578, 119
N. E. 1075.
Motion for leave to file denied.
MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS took no part in the decision of
this application.
