TANK BARGE CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 14.

Reargued October 16, 1941.--Decided November 17, 1941.

1. In the case of an unexplained sinking of a vessel under circumstances
which may give rise to an inference of unseaworthiness, the party on

whom the burden of proof rests must do more than make a case upon
the whole evidence so evenly balanced that the trier of fact is unable
to resolve doubts as to the validity of the inference. Pp. 105, 114.
2. Where the owner of a vessel has not assumed the common carrier's
special undertaking to deliver the cargo safely, the burden of proving
a breach of the shipowner's duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel rests
upon the bailor. P. 110.
3. The burden of proof in such a case does not shift with the evidence,
but remains with the baslor, who must prove ins case by a preponderance of all the evidence. P. 110.
114 F. 2d 248, affirmed.

This case came here on certiorari, 311 U. S. 643, to review the affirmance of a judgment dismissing petitioner's
claim in a proceeding. in admiralty brought originally by

the respondent for a limitation of liability. The judgment was affirmed here by an equally divided court, 313
U. S. 541; subsequently, a petition for rehearing was
granted, the judgment was vacated, and the case was restored to the docket for reargument, 313 U. S. 596.
Mr. T. Catesby Jones, with whom Messrs. Leonard J.
Matteson and Ezra G. Benedict Fox were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. Robert S. Erskine, with whom Messrs. Cletus Keating, L. de Grove Potter,and Richard Sullivan were on the
brief, for respondent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a proceeding' in admiralty originating in the
District Court upon a petition by respondent, as chartered
owner of the tank barge "T. N. No. 73," for limitation of
liability for damage to petitioner's shipment of molasses
resulting from the sinking of the barge in New York
harbor.
Petitioner, the sole claimant in the limitation proceeding, filed, in behalf of the insurer, its claim for loss of the
molasses on the barge, which sank on Oct. 23, 1937, while
taking on the shipment from the S. S. "Althelsultan."
The barge sank in smooth water, without contact with any
other vessel or external object to account for the sinking.
By the contract of affreightment with petitioner's predecessor in interest, extended to cover the year 1937, respondent undertook to transport the molasses by barges in New
York harbor from vessels or tidewater refineries to the
shipper's customers; and agreed that the barges are "tight,
staunch, strong and in every way fitted for the carriage
of molasses within the limits above mentioned and
rrespondent] will maintain the barges in such condition
during the life of this contract." The contract also con-

106

tained an undertaking on the part of the shipper of the
molasses to effect insurance on cargoes for the account of
respondent, the breach of which, it is contended, operated
to relieve respondent from liability for any unseaworthiness of the barge.
The "T. N. No. 73" was a steel tank barge with four
cargo tanks, two forward and two aft, separated by bulkheads, one extending fore and aft and the other athwartship. It had a rake fore and aft beginning 23 inches below
the deck, affording space for fore and aft peak tanks. The
customary method of stowing the barge was to pump the
molasses into the forward tanks until the barge had a
specified freeboard, then into the stern tanks until the
stern had another specified freeboard, then back into the
forward tanks until the barge was trimmed fore and aft.
In the case of the present shipment, the customary procedure was followed and the molasses was first pumped
into the forward and then into the after tanks at a rate
of from 3 to 31/2 tons a minute. When the stern had approximately the desired freeboard the mate of the barge
went forward to open the valves of the discharge pipes
connecting with the forward tanks so as to fill them sufficiently to trim the barge fore and aft. On his way he
stopped for a short time, the length of which was not precisely fixed, to carry on a conversation with some of the
men on the vessel lying alongside. When he reached the
valves for the forward tanks and before the valves for the
after tanks had been closed, the barge sank by the stern.
Only a small part of the molasses was saved, and the value
of that lost largely exceeded the vilue of the barge after
salvage operations.
Respondent attributed the sinking to overloading of the
after tanks resulting from the mate's delay in shifting the
flow of the molasses from the stern to the forward tanks.
If, as alleged, over-filling of the stern tanks caused the loss
without the privity or knowledge of respondent, it could

limit liability. R. S. ยง 4283, 46 U. S. C. ยง 183; La Bour-

gogne, 210 U. S. 95, 122; The George W. Pratt,76 F. 2d 902.
But it was unnecessary to decide any question of limiting
liability unless petitioner, the sole claimant, succeeded
in establishing its claim.
On the issues thus presented the District Court heard
a great deal of testimony by witnesses who testified to all
the circumstances attending the loading and sinking of
the barge, and by experts as to its theoretical load capacity
and the probable disposition of its load at the time the
barge sank. There was also much evidence bearing on
the seaworthiness of the vessel. This included the testimony of a representative of the cargo interests who had
inspected the barge just before she began to receive the
molasses and had found the tanks dry and clean, and who
admitted he had found no evidence of leakage. There was
also testimony by a diver who had examined the barge
while she was on the bottom, and of others who had examined her condition after she had been raised and placed
in dry dock.
After a careful review of all the evidence, the trial
judge found that it was not sufficient to establish the
fact that the sinking was caused by overloading the after
tanks. He also found as a fact that upon all the evidence "the cause of the accideint has been left in doubt."
From all this he concluded that respondent was chargeable upon its warranty of seaworthiness by reason of
the "presumption" of unseaworthiness arising from the
unexplained sinking of the barge, which would deprive
the owner of the right to limit liability. But, as he
thought the insurance clause in the contract of affreightment required petitioner to effect cargo insurance for account of respondent, which it had failed to do, he dismissed petitioner's claim. 1939 A. M. C. 673.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, 114 F. 2d 248, but for a
different reason than that assigned by the trial judge for

108

314 U. S.

his decision. It held that the burden was on petitioner
to prove that respondent had furnished an unseaworthy
barge. The court sustained the trial court's finding,
which it interpreted as meaning "that the evidence as
to whether or not the barge sank because of unseaworthiness was so evenly matched that the judge could come to
no conclusion upon the issue." But it held that the
"presumption of unseaworthiness," which would arise
from the evidence of the sinking of the barge ini smooth
water without any other apparent or probable cause, did
not survive the further proof which left in doubt the
issue of the cause of the loss. The court accordingly
held that petitioner had not sustained its burden. It
thus became unnecessary to consider what burden would
rest on the barge owner if he were seeking to limit liability on an admittedly valid claim. We granted certiorari, 311 U. S. 643, to resolve an alleged conflict of the
decision below with those of other circuit courts of appeals. Pacific Coast S. S. Co. v. Bancroft-Whitney Co.,
94 F. 180; The John Twohy, 279 F. 343; Loveland Co. v.
Bethlehem Steel Co., 33 F. 2d 655; Gardner v. Dantzler
Lumber & Export Co., 98 F. 2d 478; cf. The Edwin I.
Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, and because of the importance
in the maritime law of the principle involved.
With respect to the burden of proof, this case is to be
distinguished from those in which the burden of proving seaworthiness rests upon the vessel when it is a common carrier or has assumed the obligation of a common
carrier. The present contract of affreightment was for
private carriage in New York harbor: The Fri, 154 F.

667; The Nordhvalen, 6 F. 2d 883, and thus gave to respondent the status of a bailee for hire of the molasses.

Gerhard& Hey, Inc. v. CattaraugUsT. Co., 241 N. Y. 413,
150 N. E. 500. Cf. The Nordhvalen, supra, 887. Hence,
we are not concerned with the rule that one who has
assumed the obligation of a common carrier can relieve
himself of liability for failing to carry safely only by
showing that the cause of loss was within one of the
narrowly restricted exceptions which the law itself annexes to his undertaking, or for which it permits him to
stipulate. The burden rests upon him to show that the
loss was due to an excepted cause and that he has exercised due care to avoid it, not in consequence of his
being an ordinary "bailee" but because he is a special
type of bailee who has assumed the obligation of an
insurer. Schnell v. The Vallescura, 293 U. S. 296, 304,
and cases cited. See Coggs v. Bernard, 2 Ld. Raym. 909,
918.
For this reason, the shipowner, in order to bring himself
within a permitted exception to the obligation to carry
safely, whether imposed by statute or because he is a common carrier or because he has assumed it by contract, must
show that the loss was due to an excepted cause and not
to breach of his duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel. The

of Lading Act, ยง 12. See IX Wigmore on Evidence (3rd
ed.) ยง 2508 and cases cited. And in that case, since the
burden is on the shipowner, he does not sustain it, and the
shipper must prevail if, upon the whole evidence, it remains doubtful whether the loss is within the exception.
The Folmina,212 U. S.354,363; Schnell v. The Vallescura,
supra,306,307. A similar rule is applied under the Harter
Act, which gives to the owner an excuse for unseaworthiness, if he has exercised due care to make his vessel seaworthy, for there the burden rests upon him to show that

he has exercised such care. The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378;
The Southwark, 191 U. S. 1, 12; May v. Hamburg-Amerikanische Gesellschaft, 290 U. S. 333, 346.
But, as the court below held, the bailee of goods who has
not assumed a common carrier's obligation is not an insurer. His undertaking is to exercise due care in the protection of the goods committed to his care and to perform the
obligation of his contract including the warranty of seaworthiness when he is a shipowner. In such a case the burden of proving the breach of duty or obligation rests upon
him who must assert it as the ground of the recovery which
he seeks, Southern Ry. Co. v. Prescott, supra;Kohlsaat v.

and cased cited, as it did upon petitioner here when it alleged the breach of warranty as the basis of its claim. Petitioner apparently does not challenge the distinction which
for more than two centuries, since Coggs v. Bernard,supra,
has been taken between common carriers and those whom
the law leaves free to regulate their mutual rights and
obligations by private arrangements suited to the special
circumstances of cases like the present. Nor do we see
any adequate grounds for departing from it now or for
drawing distinctions between a private bailment of merchandise on a barge in New York harbor and of goods
stored in a private warehouse on the docks. Neither
bailee is an insurer of delivery of the merchandise; both
are free to stipulate for such insurance or for any lesser
obligation, in which case the bailor cannot recover without
proof of its breach.
The burden of proof in a litigation, wherever the law
has placed it, does not shift -with the evidence, and in de-

Opinion of the Court.

termining whether petitioner has sustained the burden
the question often is, as in this case, what inferences of
fact he may summon to his aid. In answering it in this,
as in others where breach of duty is the issue, the law takes
into account the relative opportunity of the parties to
know the fact in issue and to account for the loss which it
is alleged is due to the breach. Since the bailee in general is in a better position than the bailor to know the
cause of the loss and to show that it was one not involving
the bailee's liability, the law lays on him the duty to come
forward with the information available to him. The
NorthernBelle, 9 Wall. 526, 529; Gulf, C. & S. F. Ry. Co.
v. Ellis, 54 F. 481, 483; Pacific Coast S. S. Co. v. BancroftWhitney Co., 94 F. 180; The Nordhvalen, supra, 886. If
the bailee fails, it leaves the trier of fact free to draw an
inference unfavorable to him upon the bailor's establishing the unexplained failure to deliver the goods safely.
Southern Ry. Co. v. Prescott, supra; cf. The America,
174 F. 724.
Whether we label this permissible inference with the
equivocal term "presumption" or consider merely that
it is a rational inference from the facts proven, it does no
more than require the bailee, if he would avoid the inference, to go forward with evidence sufficient to persuade
that the non-existence of the fact, which would otherwise
be inferred, is as probable as its existence. It does not
cause the burden of proof to shift, and if the bailee does
go forward with evidence enough to raise doubts as to
the validity of the inference, which the trier of fact is
unable to resolve, the bailor does not sustain the burden
of persuasion which upon the whole evidence remains upon
him, where it rested at the start. Southern Ry. Co. v.
Prescott, supra;Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg& M. Sand Co.,

112

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

Proof of the breach of warranty of seaworthiness stands
on no different footing. The trier of fact may in many
situations infer the breach from the unexplained circumstance that the vessel, whether a common or private carrier, sank in smooth water. See The Edwin I. Morrison,
supra; Work v. Leathers, 97 U. S. 379, 380; The Harper
No. 145, 42 F. 2d 161; The Jungshoved, 290 F. 733; Barnewall v. Church, 1 Caines 217, 234; Walsh v. Washington
Marine Insurance Co., 32 N. Y. 427, 436; Zillah TransportationCo. v. Aetna Ins. Co., 175 Minn. 398, 221 N. W.
529; and cases cited below, 114 F. 2d 248, 251; Scrutton
on Charter Parties and Bills of Lading (14th ed.) 105.
Whether in such circumstances the vessel has the status
of a private bailee is of significance only in determining
whose is the burden of persuasion. Wherever the burden
rests, he who undertakes to carry it must do more than
create a doubt which the trier of fact is unable to resolve.
The Edwin I. Morrison, supra,212; The Folmina, supra,
363; Schnell v. The Vallescura,supra. The English courts,
after some obscurity of treatment, see Watson v. Clark,
1 Dow 336, have reached the same conclusion. Pickup v.
Thames Insurance Co., 3 Q. B. D. 594; Ajum Goolam
Hossen & Co. v. UnionMarine InsuranceCo., [ 1901] A. C.
362, 366; Lindsay v. Klein, [1911] A. C. 194, 203, 205; see
ConstantineS. S. Line v. ImperialSmelting Corp., [ 1941]
2 All Eng. 165, 191-92.
Proof of the sinking of the barge aided petitioner, but
did not relieve it from sustaining the burden of persuasion
when all the evidence was in. This Court, in the case of
private bailments, has given like effect to the rule that the
unexplained failure of the bailee to return the bailed goods
is prima facie evidence of his breach of duty, Southern Ry.
Co. v. Prescott,supra,640, and cases cited; see Chesapeake'
& Ohio Ry. Co. v. Thompson Mfg. Co., 270 U. S. 416, 422;
and the lower federal courts have applied, correctly we

think, the same rule with respect to proof of unseaworthiness by the shipper where the vessel has not assumed the
obligation of a common carrier. Kohlsaat v. Parkersburg
& M. Sand Co., supra, 285; Robert A. Munroe Co. v.
Chesapeake Lighterage Co., 283 F. 526; The Nordhvalen,
supra; Tomkins Cove Stone Co. v. Bleakley Co., supra;
Delaware Dredging Co. v. Graham, supra, 854. This is
but a particular application of the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur, which similarly is an aid to the plaintiff in sustaining the burden of proving breach of the duty of due
care but'does not avoid the requirement that upon the
whole case he must prove the breach by the preponderance
of evidence. Sweeney v. Erving, 228 U. S. 233.
The Edwin I. Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, calls for no
different result. There this Court reversed the findings
of the lower court on the ground that the explanation
offered for damage to the cargo by seawater taken in
through a defective bilge pump hole, was only a conjecture supported by no direct testimony and was not
sufficient to sustain the burden of the shipowner to
prove that the vessel was seaworthy, saying (p. 212): "If
the determination of this question is left in doubt, that
doubt must be resolved against" the shipowner. See
The Dunbritton, 73 F. 352, 358; The Alvena, 74 F. 252,
255. The court below had found that the bill of lading
signed by the master-owner undertook to deliver the
shipment in "good order and condition," the "dangers
of the sea excepted." No exception was taken to this
finding, and in this Court the shipper's contention that
such was the contract was not challenged by the owner.
The opinion must be taken as proceeding, as in The
Folmina and Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, on the
ground that the case was one in which the obligation assumed was that of a common carrier on whom the burden rests of proving that the cargo loss is not due to un428670*-42

seaworthiness. The expressions in the opinion, as to the
burden of proof which the shipowner must carry in order
to bring him within the exception of perils of the sea,
have been cited, in the only instances when approved by
this Court, as relating to the burden of proof on those
who have assumed the obligations of common carriers.
See The Majestic, supra, 386; The Folmina, supra, 363;
Schnell v. The Vallescura, supra, 305.
Here petitioner relied .on the inference to be drawn
from the unexplained sinking of the barge to sustain
its burden of proving ;unseaworthiness. But the evidence did not stop there.'. To rebut the inference, respondent came forward With evidence fully disclosing the
circumstances attending the sinking. Inspection of the
barge before the loading began and after she sank, and
again after she was raised, failed to disclose any persuasive evidence of unseaworthiness. The method and
circumstances of her loading at least tended to weaken
the inference which might otherwise have been drawn
that the sinking was due to unseaworthiness rather than
fault in stowing the cargo. Upon an examination of all
the evidence of which the sinking, without any proven
specific cause, was a part, the two courts below have
found that no inference as to the cause of sinking can be
drawn. Petitioner has thus failed to sustain the burden
resting on it.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting:
It has long been recognized that "courts of admiralty
are not governed by the strict rules of the common law,
but act upon enlarged principles of equity." O'Brien v.
Miller, 168 U. S. 287, 297. Where, as here, the result
of a case in admiralty is made to turn upon the distinction between a common and private carrier, one may
well ask whether more respect has been paid to technical
niceties of the common law than befits the admiralty

tradition. Cf. The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 105106, 107. I do not deny that in many situations the distinction may be important nor that legislatures and
courts may be compelled from time to time to resurvey
the changing line of separation. But here, I am convinced, the distinction is irrelevant to a just disposition
of the case before us.
In the opinion just announced, the burden of proving
seaworthiness is tied up with a common carrier's obligations as an insurer. But in Schnell v. The Vallescura,
293 U. S. 296, although the defendant was a common
carrier on whom it was held such a burden lies, no suggestion that the Court rested its result upon the peculiar
obligation of the defendant as an insurer can be found
in the opinion. And so far as appears from the briefs
and arguments of counsel as well as the majority opinion
here, it would seem that this Court has never before given
the insurer's liability of common carriers as the reason for
the heavy burden of proof they bear in admiralty cases
of this type. On the contrary, the basis usually given
for the rule is the one explicitly stated in Schnell v. The
Vallescura, supra, at page 304:
"The reason for the rule is apparent. He is a bailee
entrusted with the shipper's goods, with respect to the
care and safe delivery of which the law imposes upon
him an extraordinary duty. Discharge of the duty is
peculiarly within his control. All the facts and circumstances upon which he may rely to relieve him of that
duty are peculiarly within his knowledge and usually
unknown to the s4ipper. In consequence, the law casts
upon him the burden of the loss which he cannot explain or, explaining, bring within the exceptional case in
which he is relieved from liability."
It is difficult to see any persuasive reason for conclud- โข
ing that the rule as thus explained is any less appropriately applied to private carriers than to common

314 U. S.

carriers. In both cases the shipper normally has no
representative on board the ship, the master and crew
being employees of the carrier, with the result that the
difficulties encountered by the shipper in seeking to find
out how the loss occurred are equally great. See Carver,
Carriageof Goods by Sea (8th ed.) 9.
I have found no language in the opinions of this Court,
in cases holding the burden of proof of seaworthiness
rests on a common carrier, that even suggests, not to
say compels, the inference that a different result would
have been reached if the carrier had been a private one.
Hence, if the question of this case were one of original
impression, I should see no obstacle to a holding that
would give to the shipper here, who clearly had no easier
access to evidence than did the shipper in the Vallescura
case, the benefits of a similar allocation of the burden
of proof.
But the question is not one of. original impression.
In The Edwin I. Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, this Court held
that the burden was on a private' carrier to prove seaworthiness in a controversy distinguishable in no significant respect from that now before us. The opinion of
the Court here has suggested that the finding by the Circuit Court in the Morrison case that the bill of lading
stated that the carrier would deliver the shipment "in
good order and condition" amounted to a finding that the
carrier had by contract assumed additional obligations,
i. e., those of a common carrier. Hence, the Court sees
in that decision nothing more than the reiteration of the
proposition that a common carrier has the burden of
proving seaworthiness and finds in it no indication of
what the burden of a private carrier should be.
It may seriously be questioned whether the finding that
'the bill of lading contained the casual phrase just quoted
can properly be interpreted as a finding of a contract to
assume the peculiar liabilities (whatever they may have

COMMERCIAL CORP. v. N. Y. BARGE CORP.

BrAcK, J., dissenting.

been) of a common carrier. But even on the assumption
that the Court's interpretation of the finding is correct, its
interpretation of the basis of decision in the Morrison
case seems clearly erroneous. Nowhere in that opinion
is there the smallest suggestion that the carrier was regarded as having bargained itself into a position of special
liability. If the Court had believed a distinction must
be made between private and common carriers, I should
suppose it would have been explicit in stating that this
carrier, although a private carrier, had assumed the obligations of a common carrier by contract. I think it inconceivable that it would have left a fact of such significance
to be deduced from an inconspicuous phrase in the findings
of the Circuit Court set out in a footnote to the "Statement
of the Case" seven pages before the opinion itself begins.
The Edwin I. Morrison,supra,203, n. 1.
In The Lottawanna,21 Wall. 558,571, Mr. Justice Bradley stated: "If . . . with the new lights that have been
thrown upon the whole subject of maritime law and admiralty jurisdiction, a more rational view of the question
demands an adverse ruling in order to preserve harmony
and logical consistency in the general system, the court
might, perhaps, if no evil consequences of a glaring character were likely to ensue, feel constrained to adopt it.
But if no such necessity exists, we ought not to permit any
consideration of mere expediency or love of scientific completeness, to draw us into a substantial change of the received law." In the "received law" of this Court, at least
since 1894, when the Morrisoncase was decidedno distinction has been drawn between private and common carriers
with reference to the burden of proving seaworthiness. If
such a distinction had existed, the "new lights" shed by the
awareness of ever increasing complexity in modern shipping, a complexity equally incomprehensible to the shipper
whether he deals with a private or common carrier, could,
perhaps not without propriety,, have been taken by this
Court as a reason for erasing it. But the contrary proce-

dure, of establishing a distinction which neither was
present in our received law nor is demanded "to preserve harmony and logical consistency," seems wholly
unjustifiable.
Accordingly, it is my opinion that the judgment below
