dure, of establishing a distinction which neither was
present in our received law nor is demanded "to preserve harmony and logical consistency," seems wholly
unjustifiable.
Accordingly, it is my opinion that the judgment below

Argument for the Insurance Co.

The action of the District Court in enjoining the prosecution of the state court action, pursuant to respondent's
supplemental bill, was proper and in accordance with the
well-recognized power of federal courts of equity to effectuate and perfect their own final decrees.
The remedy by supplemental bill is of ancient, origin.

property. Shepherd v.' Towgood, Tur. & Rus. 379;
Buffum's Case, 13 N. H. 14; Ludlow v. Lansing, 4 Johns.
Ch. 613.
This Court has repeatedly held that where a federal
court has made a final decree in equity and where one of
the parties, or one in privity with him, attempts or
threatens a course of action which will nullify the decree
or lessen or impair its effect, the federal court will, upon
the filing of a supplemental bill, award its injunction.

ing in a state court, where the purpose and effect of the
state court proceeding are to relitigate issues finally adjudicated by a prior federal court decree.
This section must be construed in the light of § 262
which authorizes the federal courts to issue all writs not
specifically provided for by statute which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and
agreeable to the usages and principles of law.
The purpose of § 265 is to prevent needless friction and
unseemly conflict between federal and state courts. Oklahoma PackingCo. v. Oklahoma Gas Co., 309 U. S. 4; Hale
v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375; Essanay Film Co. v.
Kane, 258 U. S.358.
There are several well-defined classes of cases which
this Court has held do not come within the prohibition
of the statute and in which the federal courts have enjoined proceedings in state courts. Some of these are:
1. Suits to enjoin the institution or prosecution in the
state Court of proceedings to enforce a local statute which
is repugnant to the Constitution. Ex parte Young, 209
U. S.123; Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S.33; Missouri v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 241 U. S.533.
.2. Suits to enjoin the institution or prosecution of a
state court action, the result of which would be to cast
an undue burden upon interstate commerce. Atchison,
T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S.101; Riehle v. Margolies, 279 U. S.218; Hill v. Martin,296 U. S.393.
3. Suits to enjoin the institution or prosecution of a
state court action where the latter would interfere with the
custody of a res previously acquired by the federal court,
or where the federal court has the prior custody of property, in whatever form, by receivership, equitable foreclosure or other appropriate proceedings. Covell v. Heyman, 111 U. S. 176; Julianv. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S.
93; Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Alabama & Georgia Mfg.
Co., 198 U. S. 188; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260
U. S. 226.

TOUCEY v. N. Y. LIFE INS. CO.

Argument for the Insurance Co.

4. Suits to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment obtained in the state court by fraud, without service of legal
process, and without notice. Arrowsmith v. Gleason, 129
U. S. 86; Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., 236 U. S. 115.
5. Suits to enjoin further proceedings in state courts
in cases which have been removed to federal courts.
French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103
U. S.494; Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239.
6. Suits upon supplemental bills to enjoin the institution or prosecution of state court actions, the object or
effect of which is to relitigate and readjudicate issues
settled by the final decrees of the federal courts, or which
would otherwise tend to nullify those decrees or lessen. or
impair their effect. Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401;
Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S.93; Riverdale Cotton Mills v. Alabama & Georgia Mfg. Co., 198 U. S.188;
Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273; Looney v.
Eastern Texas R. Co., 247 U. S. 214; Supreme Tribe of
Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U. S.356; Independent Coal &
Coke Co. v. United States, 274 U. S. 640; Local Loan Co.
v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234; Dugas v. American Surety Co.,
300 U. S. 414.
The present case falls perfectly within the sixth classification. See Wells Fargo& Co. v. Taylor, 254 U. S. 175.
The necessity for exceptions to the literal language of
§ 265 is illustrated in: Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S.
494; Frenchv. Hay, 22 Wall. 250; Arrowsmith v. Gleason,
129 U. S.86; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S.93;
Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., 247 U. S. 214.
These cases emphasize the principle that the exceptions
which this Court has recognized from the operation of
the statute are for the purpose of avoiding conflict rather
than of creating it. See Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line,
200 U. S.273, 292; Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234;
Dugas v. American Surety,Co., 300 U. S.414, 428.

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.

314 U. S.

The existence of these well defined exceptions to the
operation of the statute was particularly noted by Justice
Brandeis in Riehle v. Margolies, 279 U. S. 218, 223, and
Hill v. Martin, 296 U. S. 393. See Oklahoma Packing
Co. v. Oklahoma Gas Co., 309 U. S. 4, 8.
If it were held that injunctions could not issue in supplemental proceedings to protect the integrity of prior
decrees in equity of the federal courts, it would follow
that these courts would also be powerless to enjoin the
enforcement of void local statutes, to enjoin proceedings
which cast an undue burden on interstate commerce, and
to enjoin state court proceedings which would interfere
with the federal court's possession of a res or of property
held in receivership or under equitable foreclosure. The
federal courts could no longer protect actions which had
been validly removed to them from the state courts. On
the contrary, the state tribunals could proceed with such
cases, thus, in effect, nullifying the removal statute, since
there is no act of Congress which expressly authorizes injunctions where cases have been removed. Hence, the
effect, if the salutary exception to the rule exemplified in
the present case were abrogated, is incalculable, and would
not only cripple the normal function of the federal courts,
destroy a great body of law which the unanimous decisions
of this Court have built up over a period of many years,
but would lead to that very conflict between the federal
and state courts which the statute under consideration
seems to have been designed to eliminate. The exceptions
to the statute which we have mentioned, as this Court has
said, are designed not to frustrate the statute but to carry
out the purpose for which it was enacted.
To construe § 265 to prohibit the injunction issued in
this case would create grave doubts respecting its consti.
tutionality under § 2 of Article III of the Constitution.
Section 265 should be so construed as to avoid these

TOUCEY v. N. Y. LIFE INS. CO.
118

Argument for the Insurance Co.

doubts, in harmony with the uniform and unanimous
decisions of this Court.
See Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66; Hill
v. Martin,296 U. S. 393; Smith v. Apple, 264 U. S. 274:.
It is entirely conceivable that Congress might properly
deprive the District Courts of the United States of those
powers equitable in nature which they have heretofore
exercised, including the power to issue injunctions provided for by § 277 of the Judicial Code (§ 263, Title 28,
U. S. C.), provided Congress at the same time constituted
other inferior courts having those equity powers, as the
Constitution requires. It is not conceivable, however,
that, without creating other courts invested with those
powers, Congress could, in the face of the constitutional
mandate, entirely deprive a federal District Court of its
powers as a court of equity. This power is of ancient
origin and inhered in courts of equity "long before the
Constitution was adopted. Irvine v. Marshall, 20 How.
558, 564; Michaelson v. United States, 266 U. S. 42, 64, 65;
Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22.
It may be that Congress can limit the power of injunction by eliminating a particular type of controversy from
its effect, as this Court has held with respect to the NorrisLaGuardia Act restricting the right of injunction in labor
disputes. Lauf v. Shinner & Co., 303 U. S. 323. But the
present situation is of a different kind. Section 265 literally construed does not limit the use of the injunction to
a particular class of controversies but purports to abolish
its use in every class of controversies where to use it will
effect a stay of proceedings in a state court. If a court of
equity is deprived of the power to carry out and effectuate
its own decrees, it in effect ceases to be a court of
equity.
That § 265 can readily be so construed as to effectuate
its purpose without creating a doubt respecting its consti-

124

tutionality is obvious from the many cases in which exceptions to its effect have been recognized. That such an
interpretation as this Court and inferior courts have heretofore given the statute ought to be respected is clear from
the recent pronouncements of this Court upon the subject
of statutory construction. United States v. American
Trucking Assns., 310 U. S. 534; Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney
Co., 311 U. S. 435.

was on the brief, for petitioner in No. 19.
Mr.Fred A. Ontjes, with whom Mr. Win. C. Green was
on the brief, for respondent in No. 19.
The decrees and orders of the District Court and of
the Circuit Court of Appeals in the foreclosure cause constitute adjudications against Phoenix of the several issues
involved in the'supplemental and ancillary proceedings.
The Delaware Superior Court erred in undertaking to
review the findings of the federal court and its conclusions
were erroneous.
The injunction orders against Phoenix do not violate
principles of equity jurisdiction. The fact that the defense of res judicata can be urged in the Delaware court
does not furnish any reason why injunctive relief should
not be granted. Story, Equity Jurisprudence (14th ed.),
§§ 1194, 1209, 1227.
The permanent prohibitory and mandatory injunction
against Phoenix did not violate § 265 of the Judicial
Code.
The federal court first acquired jurisdiction. The federal court had appointed a receiver and taken into legal
custody all of the property of the bridge company of every
description; it had rendered its opinion, findings of fact
and conclusions of law and final decree, reserving jurisdiction to deal with all matters arising under the receivership and in connection with adjustment and payment

of taxes and counsel's fees before any of the Delaware
actions were commenced. This action is still pending in
the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Iowa, with the receiver in charge of all of the bridge
company's property.
Judicial Code § 265 is not a jurisdictional statute, but
a mere limitation upon the general equity powers of the
federal courts, preventing relief by injunction in the cases
covered by it. Smith v. Apple, 264 U. S. 274; Patton v.
Marshall, 173 F. 350.
Section 265 of the Judicial Code must be construed in
connection with § 262, and if a federal court has first
obtained jurisdiction of a case it can take such action as
may be necessary to maintain its authority and enforce its
decrees. Lanning v. Osborne, 79 F. 657, 662; Julian v.
Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93; French v. Hay, 22 Wall.
250-253; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494
Section 265 does not deprive a district court of the
jurisdiction otherwise conferred by the federal statutes,
but merely goes to the question of equity in the particular
bill, making it the duty of the court, in the exercise of its
jurisdiction, to determine whether the specific case presented is one in which the relief by injunction is prohibited
by this section or may nevertheless be granted. Sovereign
Camp v. O'Neill, 266 U. S. 292; Smith v. Apple, 264 U. S.
274.
Section 265 applies only where the proceedings are first
commenced in state courts. Hamilton v. Walsh, 23 F.

MR. JUsTicE FRANKFURTER

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These cases were argued in succession and are dealt
with in a single opinion because the controlling question
in both is the same: Does a federal court have power to
stay a proceeding in ,a state court simply because the
claim in controversy has previously been adjudicated in
the federal court?
No. 16. In 1935, Toucey brought suit against the New
York Life Insurance Company in a Missouri state court.
He alleged that in 1924 the company issued him a life insurance policy providing for monthly disability benefits
and for the. waiver of premiums during disability; that
he became disabled in April, 1933, and that the defendant
fraudulently concealed the disability provisions from him;
that the defendant unlawfully cancelled the policy for
nonpayment of premiums; that in September, 1935, he
discovered the existence of the disability provisions; that
he then applied to the company for reinstatement of the
policy and for, the payment of disability benefits, and that
the company refused.

TOUCEY v. N. Y. LIFE INS. CO.
118

Opinion of the Court.

The suit was removed to the federal District Court for
the Western District of Missouri, the plaintiff being a citizen of Missouri, the defendant a New York corporation,
and the amount in controversy exceeding $3,000. All of
the material allegations of the bill were denied. The district court dismissed the bill, finding that there was no
fraud on the defendant's part and that the plaintiff was
not disabled within the meaning of the policy. No appeal
was taken.
In 1937, an action at law was brought fgainst the insurance company in the Missouri state court by one
Shay, a resident of the District of Columbia. He alleged
that he was Toucey's assignee and that Toucey's disability entitled him to judgment. It does not appear that
the insurance company- filed an answer or any other
pleading. Instead, a "supplemental bill" was fied in the
Western District of Missouri, setting forth the history
of the litigation between the parties, alleging that the
assignment to Shay was made in order to avoid federal
jurisdiction, and praying that Toucey be enjoined from
bringing any suit for the purpose of readjudicating the
issues settled by the federal decree and from further
prosecuting the Shay suit.
A preliminary injunction was granted, and affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
102 F. 2d 16. The court held that Toucey's claim in
the prior suit rested upon proof of his disability, and that
this issue, necessarily involved in the Shay proceeding,
had been conclusively determined in the insurance company's favor. Section 265 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat.
1162, 28 U. S. C. § 379, was construed not to deprive
a federal court of the power to enjoin state court proceedings where an injunction is "necessary to preserve to
litigants the fruits of, or to effectuate the lawful decrees
of the federal courts." Certiorari was denied, 307 U. S.
638, and the injunction was made permanent. Toucey

appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals again affirmed,
112 F. 2d 927. In view of the importance of the questions presented, we granted certiorari. 311 U. S. 643.
The decision below was affirmed by an equally divided
Court, 313 U. S. 538, and the case is now before us on
rehearing, 313 U. S. 596.
No. 19. The Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Company, a Delaware corporation, in 1932 executed a deed of trust conveying all of its property, principally a bridge across the
Mississippi River between Iowa and Wisconsin, to secure
a $200,000 bond issue. In 1933, the trustees, an Iowa
corporation and a Wisconsin citizen, filed a bill of foreclosure in the federal District Court for the Northern
District of Iowa. One of the Bridge Company's stockholders intervened as a party defendant, alleging that
the bonds and mortgage were fraudulent and without
consideration. Upon his motion, the Phoenix Finance
Corporation, a Delaware corporation which held almost
90% of the bonds, was joined as a plaintiff. The Bridge
Company's answer challenged the validity of the indenture and alleged that the bonds were issued without consideration. Phoenix denied all allegations of fraud.
The case was tried before a master, whose modified
conclusions were adopted by the court. Finding that the
mortgage and bonds were fraudulently issued and that
almost all the bonds were without consideration, the
court denied foreclosure. The Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, 98 F. 2d 416, and certiorari was denied, 305 U. S. 650.
Phoenix thereafter instituted five separate suits against
the Bridge Company in the Delaware state courts, seeking recovery on various notes and contracts claimed to
have constituted the consideration 'for the bonds. The
Bridge Company thereupon filed a' "supplemental bill"
in the Northern District of Iowa, asserting that the issues involved in the state court suits had been made res

Opinion of the Court.

judicata by the federal decree, and praying, inter alia,
that Phoenix be enjoined from further prosecuting the
state suits. (In one of the suits, the state court rejected
the res judicata plea, Phoenix Finance Corp. v. IowaWisconsin Bridge Co., 40 Del. 500, 14 A. 2d 386, and an
appeal is now pending in the Supreme Court of Delaware.) The district court found that Phoenix was bound
by the former decree, and that the prohibition of § 265
was no bar to an injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 115 F. 2d 1, and because of the relation
of the questions presented to those in No. 16, we brought
the case here. 312 U. S.670.
The courts below have thus decided that the previous
federal judgments are res judicata in the state proceedings, and that therefore, notwithstanding the prohibitory
provisions of § 265, the federal courts may use their injunctive powers to save the defendants in the state proceedings the ineonvenience of pleading 'and, proving res
judicata.1

federal courts dating almost from the beginning of our
history and expressing an important Congressional
policy--to prevent needless friction between state and

1793, 1 Stat. 335: "... . nor shall a writ of injunction
be granted [by any court of the United States] to stay
proceedings in any court of a state . . ." In its present
form, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U. S. C. § 379, the provision
reads as follows: "The writ of injunction shall not be

granted by any court of the United States to stay pro.ceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where
such injunction may be authorized
by any law relating
2
to proceedings in bankruptcy."
The history of this provision in the Judiciary Act of
1793 is not fully known. We know that on December 31,
1790, Attorney General Edmund Randolph reported to
the House of Representatives on desirable changes in the
Judiciary Act of 1789. Am. State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No.
17, pp. 21-36. The most serious question raised by Randolph concerned the arduousness of the circuit duties imposed on the Supreme Court justices. But the Report also
suggested a number of amendments dealing with procedural matters. A section of the proposed bill submitted
by him provided that "no injunction in equity shall be
granted by a district court to a judgment at law of a State
court." Id., p. 26. Randolph explained that this clause
"will debar the district court from interfering with the
judgments at law in the State courts; for if the plaintiff
and defendant rely upon the State courts, as far as the
judgment, they ought to continue there as they have
begun. It is enough to split the same suit into one at law,
and another in equity, without adding a further separation, by throwing the common law side of the question into
the State courts, and the equity side into the federal
courts." Id., p. 34. The Report was considered by the
House sitting as a Committee of the Whole, and then was
referred to successive special committees for further consideration. No action was taken until after Chief Justice
Jay and his associates wrote the President that their cir'Formulated as a contraction of the federal courts' equity jurisdiction, the Act of 1793 "limits their general equity powers in respect to the granting of a particular form of equitable relief; that is,
it prevents them from granting relief by way of injunction in the

cases included within its inhibitions." Smith v. Apple, 264 U. S. 274,
279. See Treiniem v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U- S. 66, 74.

cuit-riding duties were too'burdensome. American State
Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 32, p. 51. In response to this
complaint, which was transmitted to Congress, the Act of
March 2, 1793, was passed, containing in § 5, inter alia, the
prohibition against staying state court proceedings.
Charles Warren in his article Federal and State Court
Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 347, suggests that this
provision was the direct consequence of Randolph's report.
This seems doubtful, in view of the very narrow purpose
of Randolph's proposal, namely, that federal courts of
equity should not interfere with the enforcement of judgments at law rendered in the state courts. See Taylor
and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1171, n. 14.
There is no record of any 'debates over the statute. See
3 Annals of Congress (1791-93). It has been suggested
that the provision reflected the then strong feeling against
the unwarranted intrusion of federal courts upon state
sovereignty. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks before the
provision was enacted into law. The significance of this
proximity is doubtful. Compare Warren, Federal and
State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 341'-48,
with Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273, 291-92.
Much more probable is the suggestion that the provision
reflected the prevailing prejudices against equity jurisdiction. The Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.), chronicling the proceedings of the Senate while he was one of
its members (1789-1791), contains abundant evidence
of a widespread hostility to chancery practice. See
especially, pp. 92-94, 101-06 (debate on the bill that
became Judiciary Act of 1789). Moreover, Senator Ellsworth (soon to become Chief Justice of the United States),
the principal draftsman of both the 1789 and 1793 Judiciary Acts, often indicated a dislike for equity jurisdiction

37 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 96-100.1
Regardless of the various influences which shaped the
enactment of §5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, the purpose
and direction underlying the provision are manifest from
its terms: proceedings in the state courts should be free
from interference by federal injunction. The provision
expresses on its face the duty of "hands off" by the federal
courts in the use of the injunction to stay litigation in a
state court.
Second. The language of the Act of 1793 was unqualified: ".... nor shall a writ of injunction be granted to
stay proceedings in any court of a state . . ." 1 Stat.

335. In the course of.one hundred and fifty years, Congress has made few withdrawals from this sweeping
prohibition:
(1) Bankruptcy proceedings. This is the only legislative exception which has been incorporated directly into
§ 265: "....

except in cases where such injunction may

be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy." 36 Stat. 1162. This provision, based upon § 21
of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 526, was inserted in the Act of 1793 by the Revisers. R. S. § 720;
8

The last clause of § 5 of the Act of 1793, outlawing the familiar
ex parte injunction, affords another illustration of hostility to chancery
practice: "nor shall, such writ [of injunction] be granted in any case
without reasonable previous notice to the adverse party, or his attorney,
'of the time and place of moving for the same." 1 Stat. 335.
' Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1162, 28-U. S. C. § 377,
is derived from § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat' 81, which
provided that the "courts of the United States shall have power to issue
writs of sdre Jacias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially
provided for by the statute, which may be necessary for the ekdrcise of
their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and
usages of law:" The general powers thus given to the federal courts
were obviously limited by the subsequent enacment of the specific
prohibitory provisions of the Act of 1793..

Opinion of the Court.

see Proposed Draft of Revision of U. S. Statutes (1872),
vol. 1, pp. 418.
(2) Removal of actions. The Removal Acts, ever
since the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 79, have
provided that whenever any party entitled to remove
a suit shall file with the state court a proper petition
for removal and a bond with good and sufficient surety,
it shall then be the duty of the state court to accept such
petition and bond "and proceed no further in the cause.".
Section 265 has always been deemed inapplicable to removal proceedings. Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S.
494; Madisonville Traction Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U. S.
239. The true rationale of these decisions is that the
Removal Acts qualify pro tanto the Act of 1793. Subsequent decisions have clarified-the loose ground advanced
in French v. Hay, 22 Wail. 250, 253. See Kline v. Burke
Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226; Taylor and Willis, The
Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State
Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1174-75; compare Bryant v.
Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 92 F. 2d 569, 571.
(3) Limitation of shipowners' liability. The Act of
1851 limiting the liability of shipowners provides that
after a shipowner transfers his interest in the vessel to
a trustee for the benefit of the claimants, "all claims and
proceedings against the owner or owners shall cease."
9 Stat. 635, 636. Being a "subsequent statute" to the
Act of 1793, this provision operates as an implied legislative amendment to it. Providence & N. Y. S. S. Co. v.
Hill MI g. Co., 109 U. S.578, 599; see Admiralty Rule
51, 254 U. S., appendix, p. 26.
(4) Interpleader. The Interpleader Act of 1926,,44
Stat. 416, amended the 1917 Interpleader Act, 39 Stat.
929, to provide as ,follows: "Notwithstanding any provision of the Judicial Code to the contrary, said [district]
court shall have power to issue its process for all such
claimants and to issue an order of injunction against
each of them, enjoining them from instituting or prose-

cuting any suit or proceeding in any State court or in
any other Federal court .. ." See Dugas v. American
Surety Co., 300 U. S. 414, 428; Treinies v. Sunshine
Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66, 74.
(5) Frazier-Lemke Act. The filing of a petition for
relief under this Act subjects the farmer and his property, wherever located, to the "exclusive jurisdiction" of
the federal court. And except with the consent of the
court, specified proceedings against the farmer or his
property "shall not be instituted, or if instituted at any
time prior to the filing of a petition under this section,
shall not be maintained, in any court . . ." 47 Stat.
1473. See Kalb v. Feuerstein,308 U. S. 433.
Third. This brings us to applications of § 265 apart
from these statutory qualifications. The early decisions
of this Court applied the Act of 1793 as a matter of
course.' However, a line of cases beginning with Hagan
'The first case arising under the provision was Diggs & Keith
v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch 179 (1807), where the appellants brought an
action at law on various promissory notes in a state court. While
this action was still pending, the defendant filed a bill in the state
chancery court for cancellation of the notes. The latter suit was
removed to the federal circuit court which cancelled the notes and
enjoined the further prosecution of the state action at law. The
report of the proceeding in this Court states merely that "the court
being of opinion that a circuit court of the United States had
not jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings in a state court, reversed the
decree." In his Commentaries on American Law (1826) vol. 1, p.
386, Chancellor Kent, stating that the decision in the case "is not
to be contested," refers to it as illustrative of a situation "in which
any control by the federal over the state courts, other than by means
of the established appellate jurisdiction, has equally been prevented."
Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625, holding that a federal court sitting
in bankruptcy could not discharge te lien of a prior attachment
made under state law, was the first case which expressly relied upon
the Act of 1793. In Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263, 266, the Court held
it error to enjoin a state action to establish title to certain land.
"The courts of the United States have no such power over suitors in
a state court."

TOUCEY v. N. Y. LIFE INS. CO.
118

Opinion of the Court.

v. Lucas, 10 Pet. 400, holds that the court, whether federal or state, which first takes possession of a res withdraws the property from the reach of the other. Taylor
v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 597; Freeman v. Howe 24 Hbw.
450. See Kline v. Burke ConstructionCo.; 260 U. S. 226,
235: "The rank and authority of the [federal and state]
courts are equal but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt
to do so would result in unseemly conflict. The rule,
therefore, that the court first acquiring jurisdiction shall
proceed without interference from a court of the other
jurisdiction is a rule of right and of law based upon necessity, and where the necessity, actual or potential, does
not exist, the rule does not apply. Since that necessity
does exist in actions in rem and does not exist in actions
in personam, involving a question of personal liability
only, the rule applies in the former but does not apply in
the latter."
The Act of 1793 expresses the desire of Congress to avoid
friction between the federal government and the states
resulting from the intrusion of federal authority into the
orderly functioning of a state's judicial process. The
reciprocal doctrine of the res cases is but an application
of the reason underlying the Act. Contest between the
representatives of two distinct judicial systems over the
same physical property would give rise to actual physical
friction. The rule has become well settled, therefore, that
§ 265 does not preclude the use of. the injunction by
a federal court to restrain state, proceedings seeking- to
interfere with property in the custody of the court.'
Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street R. Co., 177
The extent to which a federal court's exclusive control over the res
may require use of the injunction to effectuate its decrees in rem- is

illustrated by Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188;
Julian v. Cen7al Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93; and Local Loan Co. v.. Hunt,
292 U q. 234, 241. Cf. Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610, 615.

43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 359-66. And where a state court
first acquires control of the res, the federal courts are disabled from exercising any power over it, by injunction or
otherwise. Palmer v. Texas, 212 U. S. 118.
Another group of cases is said to constitute an exception
to § 265, namely, where federal courts have enjoined litigants from enforcing judgments fraudulently obtained in
the state courts. Marshall v. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589;
Simon v. Southern Railway Co., 236 U. S. 115; Essanay
Film Co. v. Kane, 258 U. S. 358; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry.
Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S. 101; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor,
254 U. S. 175. In the Simon case, Mr. Justice Lamar
undertook to rationalize this class of cases by regarding a
state court "proceeding" as completed once judgment is
secured, with the result that an injunction against levying execution does not stay a judicial "proceeding." 236
U. S. at 124. But this construction of § 265 was rejected
in Hill v. Martin,296 U. S. 393,403: "That term [proceedings] is comprehensive. It includes all steps taken or
which may be taken in the state court or by its officers
from the institution to the close of the final process. It
,applies to appellate as well as to original proceedings; and
is independent of the doctrine of res judicata. It applies
alike to action by the court and by its ministerial officers;
applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment, but
to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary taken with
a view to making the suit or judgment effective." However, the opinion cites the Wells Fargo and Essanay Film
cases in a footnote dealing with "the recognized exceptions
to § 265." 296 U. S. 403, n. 19. The foundation of these
cases is thus very doubtful. However, we need not under-

take to reexamine them here since, in any event, they do
not govern the cases at bar."
Fourth. We come, then, to the so-called "relitigation"
cases, the first of which is Dial v. Reynolds, 96 U. S. 340.
The facts of the case are simple: Cooper was indebted to
Staatsman. To secure these debts he executed a mortgage deed of trust under which Dial was trustee. Asserting title in himself to the property covered by the
mortgage, Reynolds brought ejectment against Cooper in
the federal court. On writ of error this Court set aside
a judgment- in Reynolds' favor and held title to be in
Cooper. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 321. Reynolds thereafter dismissed his ejectment action in the
federal court and brought a new action against Cooper
in a Tennessee state court based upon the claim thus
previously litigated. Dial and Staatsman, joining Cooper
as a party defendant, filed suit in the federal court to
foreclose the mortgage and to enjoin Reynolds from further prosecuting his action in the state court. The lower
court sustained Reynolds' demurrer, and this Court affirmed. It held that the "gravamen" of the bills was an
injunction to prevent Reynolds from proceeding in the
state court. "Such an injunction, except under the
Bankrupt Act, no court of the United States can grant.
With this exception, it is expressly forbidden by law."
96 U. S. at 341.8

For similar reasons we need not here consider cases like Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123, and Gunterv. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273,
with which compare Hale v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375, 378.
' The Court also held that in a foreclosure proceeding the complainant cannot join a third person who claims adversely to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and-that consequently there was a misjoinder
of parties. 96 U. S. at 341. These grounds for decision were, of
course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the

case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there

Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., 247 U. S. 214, was not
a "relitigation" case. The Texas federal district court,
in a suit brought by various carriers, granted a preliminary injunction restraining the state Attorney General
from proceeding to assess fines and penalties upon them
for complying with an order of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The Attorney General nevertheless instituted proceedings in a state court to enjoin the carriers
from complying with the Commission's order, and *a
supplemental bill was filed in the federal court to stay the
proceedings. The district court issued the injunction,
and this Court dismissed an appeal under § 266, holding
that the injunction below was not based upon the unconstitutionality of the Texas state statutes, but was granted
merely to protect its jurisdiction until the suit brought
by the carriers was finally settled. The case obviously
does not rule ours. Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble,
255 U. S. 356, held that a federal district court, having
rendered a decree in a class suit brought in behalf of
all the members of a certain class of beneficiaries in a
fraternal association, may enjoin members of the class,
found to be bound by the decree, from prosecuting suits
in the state courts which would relitigate questions settled by such decree. The opinion of Mr. Justice Day
contains no reference to either the Act ofVIarch 2, 1793,
or to Dial v. Reynolds. The opinion is devoted almost
entirely to a discussion of whether the former decree is
res judicata in the state suits. Having determined this
question in the affirmative, the Court disposed of the
remaining-§ 265--question in one sentence, citing only
one case in support of its conclusion, Looney v. Eastern
is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld
an injunction if Reynclds had been properly joined. Nor need we
consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the
Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.

Texas R. Co., supra, which, as we have seen, was not a
relitigation case.' 255 U. S. at 367.
Fifth. We find, therefore, that apart from Congressional authorization, only one "exception" has been imbedded in § 265 by judicial construction, to wit, the res
cases. The fact that one exception has found its way
into § 265 is no justification for making another. Furthermore, the res exception, having its roots in the same
policy from which sprang § 265, has had an uninterrupted
and firmly established acceptance in the decisions. The
rule of the res cases was unequivocally on the books when
Congress reenacted the original § 5 of the Act of 1793,
first by the Revised Statutes of 1874 and later by the
Judicial Code in 1911.
In striking contrast are the "relitigation cases." Loose
language and a sporadic, ill-considered decision cannot
be held to have imbedded in our law a doctrine which so
patently violates the expressed prohibition of Congress.lo
'Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401, is erroneously regarded as
illustrating a "relitigation" exception to § 265. The case holds merely
that courts of equity have jurisdiction to "effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the
relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties."
150 U. S. at 411-12. The Court did not uphold a federal injunction
against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree-no such state suit had been brought. Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.
The "first come, first served" rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr,
188 U. S. 537, was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co.,
260 U. S. 226, 235. Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U. S. 254, 257.
" There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals
for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the "relitigation" exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation. The Report of the Special Joint Committee on
Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated
the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court.
Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470. Yet no reference
was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the

140

Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

We are not dealing here with a settled course of decisions, erroneous in origin but around which substantial
interests have clustered. Only a few recent and episodic
utterances furnish a tenuous basis for the exception
which we are now asked explicitly to sanction. Whatever justification there may be for turning past error into
law when reasonable expectations would thereby be
defeated, no such justification can be urged on behalf of a
procedural doctrine in the distribution of judicial power
between federal and state courts. It denies reality to
suggest that litigants have shaped their conduct in reliance upon some loose talk in past decisions in the appli,cation of § 265 or, more concretely, upon erroneous implications drawn from Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co.,
supra, and Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, supra.
Compare Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119-20.
It is indulging in the merest fiction to suggest that the
doctrine which for the first time we are asked to pronounce with our eyes open and in the light of full consideration, was so obviously and firmly part of the texture of our law that Congress in effect enacted it through
its silence. There is no occasion here to regard the silence
of'Congress as more commanding than its own plainly
Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the "relitigation" doctrine: Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401; Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S.
537; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188; Gunter v.
Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273. (As we have already seen,
"removal" cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, and Dietzsch v.
Huidek-oper, 103 U. S. 494, rest upon an entirely different footing.)
None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of
§ 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it. See H. Rept.
No. 818, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., referring to H. Doc. No. 783, 61st Cong.,

and unmistakably spoken words. This is not a situation
where Congress has failed to act after having been requested to act or where the circumstances are such that
Congress would ordinarily be expected to act. The provisions of § 265 have never been the subject of comprehensive legislative reexamination. Even the exceptions
referable to legislation have been incidental features of
other statutory schemes, such as the Removal and Interpleader Acts. The explicit and comprehensive policy of
the Act of 1793 has been left intact. To find significance
in Congressional nonaction under these circumstances is
to find significance where there is none.
Section 265 is not an isolated instance of withholding
from the federal courts equity powers possessed by AngloAmerican courts. As part of the delicate adjustments
required by our federalism, Congress has rigorously controlled the "inferior courts" in their relation to the courts
of the states. The unitary system of the courts of England
is saved these problems.
The guiding consideration in the enforcement of the
Congressional policy was expressed by Mr. Justice Campbell, for the Court, in Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How..583, 597:
"The legislation of Congress, in organizing the judicial
powers of the United States, exhibits much circumspection
in avoiding occasions for placing the tribunals of the
States and of the Union in any collision."
We must be scrupulous in our regard for the limits within
which Congress has confined the authority of the courts
of its own creation.

tect those who have obtained its decrees against an effort
to force relitigation of. the same causes of action in the
state courts. Questions of res judicata seem inapposite
for the conclusion. We are not concerned in either case
with the effect of the decrees if and when they might be
pleaded in the state actions. Since federal jurisdiction
in each case depended upon diversity, their effect as a
pleaded bar to recovery in the state suits would depend
upon the faith and credit by law or usage given like judgments of courts of the state containing the federal district.'
But when the preliminary question is the meaning and
application of the federal decree as a basis for. a conclusion
as to whether or not the decree shall be enforced by further
steps, it is entirely a federal question. It is immaterial
from that point of view whether the federal jurisdiction
was bottomed originally on diversity, or the Constitution
or laws of the United States. The power to give effect to
the judgments of federal courts rests with Congress.' It
has exercised that power for general purposes by Judicial
Code § 262.'
As originally enacted, § 265 was a single line in a two
page act concerning practice in the federal courts, Act of
March 2, 1793, c, 22, § 5, 1 Stat. 334. The act's disconnected provisions were amendments to the statute establishing Judicial Courts of the United States. The short
section in which § 265 appeared on the one hand enlarged

equity powers of judges of this Court by authorizing them
to issue writs of ne exeat and injunction, and on the other
restricted the use of restraining orders without notice.
Left to the four corners of the act, for lack of legislative
materials, for deductions as to the purpose and intention
of the enacting Congress, and faced with the absolute prohibition of its words, it might well be concluded that the
intention was to bar an injunction running against the
court itself as distinguished from the parties.4 The fact
that courts of equity had long exercised the power to
entertain bills to carry their decrees into execution by
injunction against the parties adds strength to such a
supposition. 5 Such needed powers would not be lightly
withdrawn.
We are not relegated to such speculations, however.
This provision in one form or another has been embodied
in our statute law since 1793. It was continued by the
adoption of the Revised Statutes of 1878 and the Judicial
Code of 1911. It and the cases interpreting it have been
woven into the fabric of our law through the decades.
What changes would have been made in its form to meet
the needs of our expanding jurisprudence, were it not for
the flexibility supplied by judicial interpretation, we can
only conjecture. Certainly when the Code of 1911 restated its terms, the Congress took into consideration
what had by that time come to be its accepted interpretation. Granted that § 265 is not a sentence or section of
a legislative scheme whose meaning is to be sought in the
purpose of the entire enactment or series of enactments,"

we are nevertheless led by the judicial history intervening
since its passage to look beyond the literal language and
give weight to those decisions which had added to its content before the reenactment in the Judicial Code. In the
Senate Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision
and Codification no change in language was suggested.
Yet the Committee, as indicative of the then state of the
law, cited numerous cases which are relitigation cases and
are analyzed or referred to later in this opinion.' We are
all the more persuaded to believe that the Code of 1911
intended to accept this early legislation with its judicial
gloss because of the alternative offered. This alternative
is that a federal judgment entered perhaps after years
of expense in money and energy and after the production
of thousands of pages of evidence comes to nothing that
is final. It is to be only the basis for a plea of res judicata
which is to be examined by another court, unfamiliar with
the record already made, to determine whether the issues
were or were not settled by the former adjudication.' We,
too, desire that the difficulties innate in the federal system
of government may be smoothed away without a clash
of sovereignties, but we find no cause for alarm in affirming a court which forbids parties bound by its decree to
fight the battle over on another day and field.' We should
not, in' reaching for theoretical symmetry, hamper the
efficiency and needlessly break the continuity of our

claims adjudged, is the usual form where injunctions are
appropriate for determhining controversies.'
The courts properly are hesitant to depart from literalism in interpreting a statute." Strong equities do induce
departure from the ordinary course where the purpose of
the Congress appears plain.'2 It is hard to conceive of a
statute, new or old, which has a meaning totally disassociated from supporting legislation or the body of adjudications within its ambit. This statute is in a posture much more favorable for the interpretation that
it authorizes injunctions against relitigation in state
courts than were the statutes construed in any of the
cases cited in the preceding note for the interpretation
given them. In fact, we conclude that its restatement in
the Code of 1911, with the decisions now to be examined
in existence,.necessitates the interpretation here advocated. Additional decisions since 1911 and the failure
of Congress to repudiate this interpretation add something of substance to this argument.
There exists no divergence of view in regard to the
power of federal courts to enjoin proceedings in state
courts where the state action may embarrass or interfere
with the federal court's prior control over a res which is
in its possession.' That is an exception to § 265.
Equally firmly embedded is the power, long exercised as
compatible with § 265, of carrying into execution by injunction against state actions the equitable decrees which
have settled rights or claims between the parties to the
federal litigation. This might be said to be auxiliary to
the protective jurisdiction over property in the possession

of a court. Inasmuch, however, as the cases hereafter
cited concern rights arising from claims already adjudicated, and since, in the cases where a res was at one
time involved, the property was no longer in the possession of the court issuing the injunction, the theory of
preventing an unseemly clash over physical possession
has no basis. The principle for which the following
authorities stand is that a court has the right to execute its decrees to avoid relitigation and forced reliance
on res judicata. The proceedings, as will be made to
appear later, which were supplemented by the orders prohibiting state suits here under review, fall well within
the limits of this hitherto well recognized conception.
As early as 1893 this Court declared, in Root v. Woolworth, 150-U. S. 401, 411, that the "jurisdiction of courts
of equity to interfere and effectuate their own decrees by
injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the
relitigation of questions once settled between the same
parties, is well settled." Root, the party enjoined by the
original decree, asserted rights which would require relitigation of settled issues. Accordingly he was enjoined on
supplemental bill, inter alia, "from bringing any action or
actions touching the title to or possession of the said
premises . . ." Until dissolved, that injunction forbade
proceedings in state and federal courts alike. Although
§ 265 was not discussed, the case is cited as a convenient
summary of the then law, and because it promptly became
a precedent for enforcement of decrees even when the
problem of § 265 was raised. The authority of this case
has not been doubted until now.
Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537, 544, forbade a state suit in
violation of a federal court stipulation for a decree, treated
the stipulation as a decree, and enjoined an action in personam in the state court for the collection of penalties
under an unconstitutional statute. The state action was
in violation of the original federal decree. This Court
said: "The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court could not be

defeated or impaired by the institution, by one of the parties, of subsequent proceedings, whether civil or criminal,

involving
In 193 U.
S. appeared the case of Julianv. Central Trust
Company. A railroad property in North Carolina had
been sold under foreclosure proceedings in the federal circuit court. The decree was that the property be sold free
of all claims of parties and the judicial sale was confirmed
to the Southern Railway Company. Some years later
a cause of action arose which was prosecuted to judgment
in a state court against the original mortgagor without
notice to or claim against the purchaser, the Southern.
In the face of a threat to sell the property formerly conveyed by the federal decree, the circuit court enjoined the
state proceedings. This Court said, pp. 112, 114: "In
such case we are of opinion that a supplemental bill may
be filed in the original suit with a view to protecting the
prior jurisdiction of the Federal court and to render effectual its decree. . . . In such cases where the Federal
court acts in aid of its own jurisdiction and to render 'its
decree effectual, it may, notwithstanding sec. 720, Rev.
Stat., [§ 265 J. C.] restrain all proceedings in a state court
which would have the effect of defeating or impairing its
jurisdiction. . . . It is conceded that the Federal right
could be set up in the state court from which the execution
issued, and, if denied, the ultimate rights of the parties
can be determined upon writ of error to this court. In the
view we have taken of this case the Federal court had not
lost its jurisdiction to protect the purchaser at its sale
upon direct proceedings such as are now before us." ',
'4 The doctrine of the Julian case finds illustrations in the lower federal courts. While it is true that thoie courts were enforcing fore-

closure, that purpose had been accomplished and the enjoined state
suits sought relitigation of closed issues. James v. Central Trust Co.,

Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 189,
followed the established doctrine. The Riverdale Mills
acquired property by judicial sale in the federal court.
A state proceeding later was begun by parties to the federal foreclosure alleging the invalidity of the sale and
seeking possession of the property. Riverdale then filed
an ancillary bill in the original foreclosure suit for an injunction against prosecution of the state suit. Against
the claimed protection of R. S. §720 (§ 265 J. C.), p. 193,
it was held here that a federal court may "protect the title
which it has decreed as against every one a party to the
original suit and prevent that party from relitigating the
questions of right which have already been determined."
P. 195.
It is quite clear that the Court in both the Julian and
the Riverdale cases was intent not on protecting a res,
since that had long passed from its hands, but on avoiding
relitigation by executing its decrees. this appears particularly from their reliance upon Frenchv. Hay, 22 Wall.
250; Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494; and Sharon v.
Terry, 36 F. 337. In the Frenchcase no res was involved.
It was a federal injunction against the enforcement of a
judgment of a state court obtained in a state action after
removal of a related but separate state suit. The reasoning proceeded upon the protection of federal judgments,
not on the language of the removal statute. The same
is true of Dietzsch. There a state suit on a replevin bond
was enjoined by the federal court because it grew out of a
failure to return property awarded in replevin in a state
court after the removal of the original replevin suit to the
federal court which issued the injunction. It was there
said, p. 497: "A court of the United States is not prevented
from enforcing its own judgments by the statute which
forbids it to grant a writ of injunction to stay proceedings
t
in a State court."

The Court today lays aside Gunter v. Atlantic Coast
Line, 200 U. S. 273 (1906), as inapplicable. The case in
our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.
It forcefully declares, albeit by alternative ruling, for
the position here taken. A federal court had enjoined
a state tax on the ground of unconstitutionality. The
state was a party. Years later the state brought an action in the state court for the tax which the decree prohibited. An ancillary bill sought and obtained an injunction from the federal court. This Court said, p.
292, "Indeed, the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment, or section 720 of the Revised Statutes, control
a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a
decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction,
is not open for discussion. Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103
U. S.494; Proutv. Starr, 188 U. S.537; Julian v. Central
Trust Co., 193 U. S.93, 112." It cannot fairly be said,
we think, that this was not a holding that a federal court
has the duty to protect its parties against relitigation.
This seems quite certain when We examine the cases cited
which are discussed heretofore in this opinion.

determined the fraudulent character of a marriage contract, and had enjoined all efforts to establish rights
under any of its provisions. Notwithstanding this decree, a party thereafter sought and obtained a judgment
of the highest court of the state determining the marriage
contract valid. There was no plea of res judicata in the
state proceedings. After the entry of the state judgment, the personal representative of the winning party

R. S. § 720 (§ 265 J. C.) barred the order. 36 F. 337,
365.
The opinion was by Justice Field of this Court, on
circuit, and stated: "The decree of the federal court,
when revived, may be used to stay any attempted enforcement of the judgment of the state court." P. 364.
It is true that the opinion shows that the circuit court
was of the view that prior jurisdidtion of an in personam
cause gave the federal court authority to issue an injunction against state proceedings. P. 366. But the
decision was directly on the point of enforcement of a
decree. When the case came to this Court it was affirmed without consideration of § 265 on the ground that
the ' propriety of the revivor was the oriy matter for
decision, 131 U. S. 40.
In the later case of Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Jones,
170 F. 124 (1909), a federal court had decided that a
state statute fixing railroad rates was unconstitutional,
and had entered decrees for the railroads accordingly.
Thereafter, a county attorney commenced a suit in the
state court against the companies to restrain collection
of any but the statutory rate. On supplemental bill by
the railroads the federal court enjoined him from prosecuting that suit, and relitigating the rate controversy.
Similarly, in St. Louis Mining & Milling Co. v. Montana
Mining Co., 148 F. 450 (1906), the unsuccessful party in
the federal suit was enjoined from proceeding further in
the state court to relitigate matters already decided."
The fact that the federal proceeding was ancillary to an
action to try title seems to have had no part in the
decision."

These cases were all handed down before the adoption
of the Judicial Code in 1911. They are catalogued to
show that the power of the federal courts to make their
decrees effective was accepted as consonant with
the general prohibition of § 265. Pomeroy ,taught that
this was the law in 1905."' The rule was 'applied after
1911 when occasion arose.

By Supreme Tribe of Ben-

Hur v. Cauble, 255 U. S. 356, 367, it was decided in 1921
almost without discussion that a federal court which
had entered a decree as to rights in a fraternal benefit
association in a class suit might enjoin by ancillary
bill other members of the class from relitigating the
issues in a state suit.

Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co.,

247 U. S. 214, cited as a controlling precedent, was suggested there by appellant, the Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur,
upon the very point here under discussion. Id., 65
Law. Ed. 675. This Court now lays the Looney case aside
as not being a "relitigation" case. While the injunction in
the Looney case was nut in aid of a decree, it.was in aid
of jurisdiction taken to determine a Texas rate controversy. A temporary injunction had been entered to maintain the status quo until a review by the Interstate Commerce Commission. A temporary injunction may well
be likened to a decree and, entitled to the same protection
against relitigation. Such was evidently this Court's
view. It said, page 221: "So important is it that unseemly
conflict of authority between state and federal courts
should be avoided by maintaining the jurisdiction of each
free from the encroachments of the other, that § 265 of
the Judicial Code, Rev. Stats., § 720, Act of March 2, 1793,
Ry. Co., 146 F. 337, 340 (1906). Craft v. Lathrop, Fed. Cas. No.

power without consideration of the contemporary equivalent of § 265.

c. 22, 1 Stat. 334, has repeatedly been held not applicable

The last case in this Court, Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292
U. S. 234' upheld by a unanimous court an injunction,
upon an ancillary bill in a bankruptcy proceeding, forbidding the prosecution in a state court of a claim discharged in bankruptcy. This Court placed its decision
squarely on the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to
execute its decrees "notwithstanding the provisions of
§ 265 of the Judicial Code." Quite properly no mention
is made of the exception in § 265 "except in cases where
such injunction may be authorized by any law relating
to proceedings in bankruptcy." The only authorization
for injunctions is in Bankruptcy Act § 11, 11 U. S. C. § 29,
which provides for a stay of pending suits during adjudication in bankruptcy. This is substantially the language
of § 21 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 526, which
caused the insertion of the exception in the Revised Statutes, as is shown by the cross-reference under R. S. § 720.
The specific exception of § 265 was inapplicable to the
Local Loan Company ,situation. Furthermore, this case
involved a res only in the sense that every bankruptcy
proceeding involves a res, i. e., the estate.
Other federal courts, since the adoption of the Judicial
Code, have continued to enjoin relitigation of settled
issues."8

half a century there has been a widely accepted rule sup"St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. v. McElvain, 253 F. 123 (1918)

porting the power of federal courts to prevent relitigation.
There are adequate precedents directly in point and others
which recognize that the rule exists and is sound. Some
at one time involved a res. A number applied the same
rule when a res was never in the hands of the court. Not a
case nor a text book is cited to support the Court's present
position. No articles in periodicals suggest the propriety
or desirability of so positive a change, except a single query
as to the logic of the relitigation development.19 Though
the Judicial Code received careful analysis before adoption, 20 no language was inserted to disavow the settled construction of the reenacted section. Dial v. Reynolds, 96
U. S. 340, said by the Court to be a "relitigation" case, did
not involve a decree. In a federal suit to quiet title an
injunction was sought to forbid a state action in ejectment.
It is in line with Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260
U. S. 226, but not even persuasive on the question of relitigation or execution of decrees.
We turn now briefly to the original and auxiliary decrees
in the two cases under consideration. In the Toucey case,
his suit in equity against the insurance company for restoration of an insurance policy and payments for benefits
under it on the ground of the fraud of the company was decided against Toucey. An assignee of Toucey's in privity
with him sought to relitigate the same issues in a state
court. The federal court which entered the original decree enjoined on supplemental bill "retrial, reconsideration
or readjudication" of the settled issues and the prosecution
of the state action.'

In the Iowa-Wisconsin Bridge Co. case, a decree, invalidating a certain mortgage and'bonds issued in consideration of claimed indebtedness after protracted litigation,
was entered December 1, 1936, in a mortgage foreclosure
suit brought in a federal court by the bondholders. This
decree became final.2
Thereafter parties to the proceedings sought to litigate, in the state courts of Delaware, the
validity of certain items of the indebtedness which are
alleged to form the basis for the bond issue and to have
been invalidated by the former federal decree. A'supplemental and ancillary bill was filed by the Bridge Company
in the original federal court suit seeking an injunction
against the relitigation of the already adjudicated causes
of action. The District Court granted the injunction on
a finding that the causes declared upon in Delaware had
been settled by the federal litigation."3
These summary statements show plainly, it seems to us,
that the injunctions now set aside by this Court were
issued within the recognized rule that federal courts may
protect their decrees by prohibiting relitigation, without
violation of § 265 as heretofore understood and interpreted.
Both decrees should be affirmed.2
