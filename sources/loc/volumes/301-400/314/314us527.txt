ON CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 39. Argued November 18, 19, 1941.-Decided January 5, 1942.
1. Revised Statutes, § 1020, 18 U. S. C. § 601, provides that when
any recognizance in a criminal case returnable to any court of the
United States is forfeited by a breach of the conditions thereof,
such court may remit the whole or a part of the penalty whenever
it appears that there has been no "willful default of the party,
and that a trial can, notwithstanding, be had in the cause, and that
public justice does not otherwise require the same penalty to be
enforced." Held:
(1) That this statute is the exclusive source of the power of the
District Court at any time to remit the forfeiture of a recognizance
in a criminal cause. P. 533.'
(2) The word "party" appearing in the phrase "willful default
of the party," means only the principal in the recognizance; it
does not include the surety. P. 530.
2. Where the words of the Revised Statutes are clear, their meaning
may not be changed by resort to the prior law. P. 530.
RESPONSE to questions certified by the Circuit Court of
Appeals on a review by that court of a judgment of the
District Court, 34 F. Supp. 1007, .which dismissed a petition praying that forfeiture of a recognizance be remitted.
The petitioners were the surety and its indemnitor.

the power of a District Court of the United States to
relieve an innocent surety from the penalty of a forfeited
recognizance.
The principal in the recognizance, "Herbert R. Short,
was convicted in the District Court for the District of
New Jersey on June 20, 1940, upon two counts of an
indictment charging conspiracy and was on that day
directed to appear in the court on July 19, 1940, for
sentence. On July 19, 1940, Short did not appear in
the said court. The court thereupon ordered a bench
warrant to issue and ordered the recognizance to be
forfeited. Short was apprehended on August 29, 1940.
On September 12, 1940, he was brought before the District Court and sentence was then imposed upon him."
The surety, Continental Casualty Company, and its
indemnitor, Marie M. Short, the wife of the principal,
the convicted defendant, filed a joint petition in the
District Court within the term at which the order of
forfeiture had been entered, praying for remission of
the forfeiture. "The District Court found as a fact that
the default of Herbert R. Short, the principal in the
recognizance, was willful, and dismissed the petition for
remission of the forfeiture upon the ground that it was
without power under Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes, 18 U. S. C. § 601, to grant the petition in view
of the willful default of the principal, and that it had
no power independently of the statute to entertain the
petition."
The Court of Appeals, being in doubt as to the power
of the District Court, certified the following questions to
this Court for instructions:
"1. Is Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes (18 U. S.
C. § 601) the exclusive source of the power of the District Court of the United States at any time to remit the
forfeiture of the penalty of a recognizance taken in a
criminal cause?

Opinion of the Court.

"2. Is the word 'party' appearing in the phrase 'willful
default of the party' in Section 1020 of the Revised Statutes (18 U. S. C. § 601) intended to describe
(a) the person who makes application to the court for
the remission of the forfeiture of the penalty, whether
that person is the principal or the surety in the recognizance, or
(b) only the principal in the recognizance?
"3. If the answer to Question 1 is 'No' does the District
Court of the United States have common law power to
remit the forfeiture of the penalty of a recognizance taken
in a criminal cause, where the default of the principal in
the recognizance was willful?
"4. If Question 3 is answered and the answer thereto
is 'Yes' is the common law power to remit the forfeiture
limited to exercise upon an application made within the
term of court at which the order of forfeiture was
entered?"
The answers depend upon the construction of § 601
of Title 18 of the United States Code, set out below.'
This section assumed its present form in the Revised
Statutes § 1020, approved June 22, 1874. R. S. Title
LXXIV, § 5596; repealed all acts mentioned in the revision passed prior to December 1, 1873. The revision
substituted the word "party" for the word "parties"
which was in the earlier act, and by reenactment thus
raised the question as to whether the willful default
mentioned in both the revision and the former act may
be that either of the principal or his bail, or whether it
is restricted, on account of the revision, to the principal
"'When any recognizance in a criminal cause, taken for, or in, or
returnable to, any court of the United States, is forfeited by a
breach of the condition thereof, such court may, in its discretion,
remit the whole or a part of the penalty, whenever it appears to
the court that there has been no willful default of the party, and
that a trial cn, notwithstanding, be had in the cause, and that public
justice does not otherwise require the same penalty to be enforced."

only. The provision for remission of forfeitures was first
enacted in 1839 as § 6 of an "Act in amendment of the
acts respecting the Judicial System of the United
States." ' 2 The act included various procedural provisions designed to fix practice in the federal courts.
The change to the singular in the Revised Statutes was
made without any explanation of its purpose and indeed
without the brackets or italics used to indicate a repeal
or amendment. See Preface, R. S. (2d ed., 1878), p. v.
The revised form, however, is to be accepted as correct,
notwithstanding a possible discrepancy. R. S. § 5596;
United States v. Bowen, 100 U. S. 508, 513; Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, 157 U. S. 1, 45. Cf. U. S.
C., (1940 ed.) p. LvII, § 2 (a).
It appears to us that there can be but one person who
can willfully default within the meaning of the section.
This is the principal in the recognizance. By its terms
he agrees to "appear for judgment." When, without excuse, he fails to appear, there is a willful default. The
surety only guarantees that the principal will not default.
In a certain sense the surety may default by failure to pay
its obligation, but this is plainly not the kind of default to
which the statute refers. Nor will the possibility of collusion of the surety with the absconding principal permit
an interpretation that misconduct on the part of the
applicant for relief from forfeiture is the "default" meant
by the statute. The condition of the bond is the appearance of the principal at the time set. Nothing less satisfies the condition.
The appellants urge against this conclusion that, since
the object of "a recognizance is not to enrich the treasury"
but to promote convenience of criminal administration,
UnitedStates v. Feely, Fed. Cas. No. 15,082, and to remedy
hardships caused by defaults, the word "party" should be
liberally construed to cover not only principals but sure25

Opinion of the Court.

ties, without willful default, even though the principal
may have deliberately violated the terms of the recognizance. They further point out that justice suffers no
affront, since surrender of the fugitive in time for trial is
another and an essential condition of the remission of the
penalty.
But the considerations of policy are too confused to
afford a clear test of Congressional purpose. Paid sureties are often, as here, indemnified. Remission of penalty
would inure to the benefit of defendants, who had violated
their undertakings of appearance with consequent disorganization of criminal administration. A bail charged
with custody of a defendant, Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall.
366, 371, may exerdise to the substantial benefit of criminal administration a high degree of care to prevent default, if he knows the later fortuitous apprehension of the
principal will not relieve him of the forfeit. It is not
for courts to say whether strict forfeiture on willful default
or a generous attitude toward innocent bail will be most
conducive to the public welfare. Hence, not for reasons
of policy, but because of the language of the statute, we
conclude that Congress has chosen the former.
After the change to "party," with exceptions in the
District Courts,3 all the Circuits except the First' and
Tenth have reached our conclusion, to wit, that the statute
requires as a condition to the remission of the penalty a
determination that the principal in the recognizance is
free of willful default.' No Circuit has decided to the
contrary.

Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

Since there is no doubt as to the willful default of the
principal, under the interpretation of the statute just
reached, relief, if any there is for the bail, must be in other
sources of judicial power as suggested in Questions 1 and 3
of the certificate. That is to say, that in addition to the
statutory power the courts have a common law power to
remit forfeitures in their discretion. United States v.
Feely, 1 Brock. 255, Fed. Cas. No. 15082 (1813 C. C.), is
relied upon as authority. In that case, decided before the
statute, Chief Justice Marshall exercised the power and
stayed proceedings. Appellant urges that forfeiture is a
judgment within the power of courts to modify on application made, as here, during the term, and that this power
is not affected by the statute, which was intended to
extend the power to remission after the term in which
forfeiture was entered.
No authority, historical or judicial, is cited by appellant
to support its view that the purpose of the Act of February 28, 1839, was to confer power upon the courts of the
United States to act after the term in which the forfeiture
was entered, in contradistinction to power already existing
to relieve from forfeitures during !the term. We see

Opinion of the Court.

nothing in the act itself to persuade us that the generality
of the words "whenever it appears to the court" means
after the term in which the forfeiture was entered. Such
a desire on the part of Congress to extend the power of
the courts would be manifested by the language of extension rather than differentiation. If the reason was as
appellant contends, why qualify the discretion after the
term by the conditions of the statute and leave the discretion during the term unqualified?
Whatever may have been the powers of the courts of
the United States before the statute, those powers are
now regulated by statute. Cf. United States v. Mack,
295 U. S. 480, 488. These statutory powers are exclusive. Before remission may be allowed there must be a
determination of lack of willfulness in the default, that
a trial can be had, and that public justice does not otherwise require the enforcement of the penalty. The statement of the conditions negatives action without the
satisfaction of those requirements. Generally speaking,
a "legislative affirmative description" implies denial
of the non-described powers. Durousseau v. United
States, 6 Cranch 307, 314. The circumstances of this
inquiry carry us beyond the rule of expressio unius est
exclusio alterius, cf. Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593,
611, and into the domain of inconsistency of phrpose.
Cf. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co.,
204 U. S. 426, 436 et seq. There cannot logically be two
series of tests to determine the power of a federal court
to relieve of forfeiture under a recognizance. The conditions for action make action without meeting the
conditions, we think, contrary to Congressional purpose,
as expressed in the statute. Since the passage of the
original statute on remission of forfeitures, the courts
of the United States have, in general, held the same view
that the statutory power was exclusive.'

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.

No. 143. Argued November 18, 1941.-Decided January 5, 1942.
1. Upon a thorough investigation of the grain rate structure in the
western district, the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed
rate-break combinations as the exclusive basis of transit privileges at
primary markets. However, transit privileges at interior points on
routes passing through a primary market were allowed on the basis
of lower rates in effect over competing routes between the same
points. Held that, considering the whole history of grain rate
regulation, the differentiation between primary markets and interior
points thus made by the Commission was not an undue or unreasonable discrimination forbidden by the Interstate Commerce Act.
P. 544.
2. The contention that the orders of the Commission are invalid
because they deprive the primary markets of natural competitive
advantages is rejected. P. 548.
3. Whether a discrimination is unreasonable under the Act is a question of fact that has been confided by Congress to the judgment and
discretion of the Commission, and upon which its decisions, made
the basis of administrative orders operating in futuro, are not to be
