HELVERING v. LERNER STORES CO.
459

Syllabus.

The result in individual cases may be harsh. But that
may be true in case of any statute of limitations. As we
indicated in J. E. Riley Investment Co. v. Commissioner,
supra, such considerations, though a basis for an appeal to
Congress for relief in individual cases,' are not appropriate
grounds for relief by the courts from the strictness of
the statutory demand.
Affirmed.
HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE v. LERNER STORES CORP. (MD.)
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 248. Argued December 11, 1941.--Decided December 22, 1941.
1. An amended capital stock tax return, to correct an undervaluation
of the taxpayer's capital stock declared by mistake in its "first
return," can not be filed after the lapse of 30 days from the statutory
due date and after the expiration of the period for which an extension might have been allowed by the Commissioner if application
for it had been made. &aife Company v. Commissioner, ante,
p. 459. P. 466.
provided for correction of certain errors or miscalculations in the
original returns. Such an example is Art. 43-2 of Treasury Regulations 86 providing for the filing of amended returns for the purpose
of deducting losses which were sustained during a prior taxable year.
'Thus Private Act No. 199, c. 440, 50 Stat. 1014, provides that the
original declared value of the Jackson Casket & Manufacturing Co.,
notwithstanding the declaration in its return for the year ending
June 30, 1936, should be a value computed on the basis of $125 per
share of its capital stock. From the Committee Reports it appears
that, due to a mistake by Western Union Telegraph Co. in transmitting
a message from the president of the company to its cashier, the latter
filed a return in which the value of the capital stock was declared
to be $175 per share, rather than $125 per share as the president
had directed. H. Rep. No. 777, 75th Cong., 1st Ses.; S. Rep. No.

2. In allowing the taxpayer to fix its own valuation of its capital stock,
thereby affecting its tax liability under the closely related capital
stock and excess profits tax provisions, the Revenue Act of 1935
does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power. P. 468.
3. A claim of unreasonable classification or inequality in the incidence
or application of a tax raises no question under the Fifth Amendment, which contains no equal protection clause. P. 468.
4. The propriety or wisdom of a tax on profits, computed with
reference to a specified criterion of value of capital stock, is not
open to challenge in the courts. P. 468.
5. There is no constitutional reason why Congress may not avoid
litigious valuation problems by relying on the self-interest of taxpayers to place a fair valuation on their capital stock. P. 468.

an excess profits tax.
CERTIORARI,

Mr. Richard H. Demuth, with whom Assistant Solicitor
General Fahy, Assistant Attorney General Clark, and
Messrs. J. Louis Monarch and William L. Cary were on
the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Andrew B. Trudgian for respondent.
The taxpayer is not bound by the clerical error resulting
in the statement of an erroneous value.
The taxpayer may elect to declare any value it sees fit
in
amended return; and a return before the end
of aitstimely
first income tax year ending after the
declaration
year is timely.
The capital stock tax under § 105 was an excise tax.
The excess profits tax under § 106 was an income tax.
Since, under these sections, there were two distinct types
of taxes, taxpayers were given the option of imposing on
themselves a direct tax or an indirect tax as they desired.
A taxpayer might declare no value for capital stock and
thus elect the excess profits tax; or it might declare a
large apital stock value and avoid imposition of excess

profits tax; or it might by a medium declaration elect to
pay both capital stock and excess profits taxes. Congress
may not thus delegate its ldgislative authority. See Black,
American Const. Law, 3d Ed. pp. 373 et seq.; Field v.
Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan,
293 U. S. 388; United States v. Grimaud,220 U. S. 506.
Sections 105 and 106 of the Revenue Act of 1935 are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
The excess profits tax, considered together with its related
capital stock tax, places a premium on the good luck or
ability of the taxpayer to predict the amount of net income it will earn in the future. The taxpayer with less
ability as a guesser, or in some instances, with less business
acumen or opportunity, is heavily penalized and must
bear a heavier burden than its more fortunate or able
rival. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1,
24-25; Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, 504.
The statute likewise produces gross inequality in its
effect on those businesses which involve more risks, and
wider fluctuation in the amount of income.
Moreover, the tax operates unfairly against many taxpayers because of the ending dates of their fiscal years.
Solely because the taxpayer herein has a fiscal year ended
January 31st, it must bear a greater tax burden than one
on the calendar year basis.
MR. Jusric

DouGI s delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a companion case to Scaife Co. v. Commissioner,
ante, p. 459. The tax in dispute is respondent's excess
profits tax for the fiscal year 1937. Respondent filed a
timely capital stock tax return for the first year, ended
June 30, 1936, in which the declared value of its capital
stock was stated to be $25,000. This return was filed September 27, 1936, an extension of time until September 29,
1936 having been obtained. The figure of $25,000 was

erroneous due to a mistake made by an employee of
respondent. When the error was discovered, an amended
return was tendered in which the declared value of the
capital stock was given as $2,500,000. This was on January 27, 1937, more than sixty days after the statutory
due date. The amount of the tax, penalty and interest on
the higher amount was tendered. The amended return
was not accepted and the amount of the remittance was
refunded. Petitioner, in determining respondent's net
income subject to the excess profits tax for the fiscal
year ended January 31, 1937, used the declared value
of $25,000 appearing in the original return. The order
of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the Commissioner was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 118
F. 2d 455.
On the issue of timeliness of the amended return the
decision in the Scaife case is determinative. The case
for disallowance of the amendment is even stronger here,
for the amended return was filed beyond the period for
which any extension could have been granted by the Commissioner. The hardship resulting from the misplaced
decimal point is plain. But Congress, not the courts, is
the source of relief.
Resporndent in its brief tenders another issue. It contends here, as it did before the Board and the Circuit
Court of Appeals, that §§ 105 and 106 of the Revenue
Act of 1935 constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative
authority, contrary to Art. 1, § 8 of the Constitution; that
they violate the Fifth Amendment; and that the capital
stock and excess profits taxes, being "based on guesses
and wagers," are beyond the delegated powers of Congress. The Board and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
adversely to respondent on these constitutional issues.
Respondent filed no cross-petition for certiorari. Yet a
respondent, without filing a cross-petition, may urge in
support of the judgment under review grounds rejected,

by the court below. Langnes v. Green, 282 U. S. 531,
538-539; Public Service Commission v. Havemeyer, 296
U. S. 506,509; McGoldrick v. CompagnieGenerale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434.
The constitutional issues, however, are without substance. As we noted in Haggar Co. v. Helvering, 308
U. S. 389, 391-392, 394, the capital stock tax and the excess
profits tax are closely interrelated. The declared value
of the capital stock is the basis of computation of both
taxes. The declared value for the first year is the value
declared by the corporation in its first return; the declared value for subsequent years 1 is the original declared
value as changed by certain specified capital adjustments.
Sec. 105 (f), Revenue Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 1014, 1018.
The taxpayer is free to declare any value of the capital
stock for the first year which it may choose. While a low
declaration of value decreases the amount of the capital
stock tax, it increases the risk of a high excess profits tax.
On the other hand, a high declaration of value, while decreasing the tax on excess profits, increases the capital
stock tax. By allowing the taxpayer "to fix for itself the
amount of the taxable base" for purposes of computation
of these taxes, Congress "avoided the necessity of prescribing a formula for arriving at the actual value of capital"-a problem "which had been found productive of
much litigation under earlier taxing acts." Haggar Co.
v. Helvering, supra, p. 394. See 1 Bonbright, Valuation
of Property, pp. 577-594. "At the same time it guarded
against loss of revenue to the Government through understatements of capital" by providing a formula which
would in such circumstances result in an increase in the
excess profits tax. HaggarCo. v. Helvering,supra,p. 394.
' There is no limitation of time on the use of the original declared
value under the 1935 Act. It should be noted, however, that § 1202
of the Internal Revenue Code (see § 601 (f) of the Revenue Act
of 1938, 52 Stat. 447, 566) provides that the "adjusted declared value

There is present no unlawful delegation of power. Congress has prescribed the method by which the taxes are to
be computed. The taxpayer here is given a choice as to
value. While the decision which it makes has a pronounced effect upon its tax liability, that is not uncommon in the tax field. Congress has fixed the criteria in
light of which the choice is to be made. The election
which the taxpayer makes cannot affect anyone but
itself.
The contention that these provisions of the Act run
afoul of the Fifth Amendment is likewise without merit.
A claim of unreasonable classification or inequality in the
incidence or application of a tax raises no question under
the Fifth Amendment, which contains no equal protection
clause. LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, 256 U. S.
377; Sunshine Anthracite CoalCo. v. Adkins, 310;U. S. 381,
401. The propriety or wisdom of a tax on profits, computed in reference to a specified criterion of value of capital stock, is not open to challenge in the courts. LaBelle
Iron Works v. United States, supra, p. 393. That being
true, there is no constitutional reason why Congress may
not, because of administrative convenience alone (Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S. 495, 511 and
cases cited), avoid litigious valuation problems and rely on
the self-interest of taxpayers to place a fair valuation on
their capital stock. As was stated in Rochester Gas &
Electric Corp. v. McGowan, 115 F. 2d 953, 955, "To say
that Congress could not choose a scheme implemented by
such mild sanctions, as an alternative to actually computing an 'excess profits tax' with all the uncertaiaty and litigation which that had involved, would be most unreasonshall be determined with respect to three-year periods beginning with
the year ending June 30, 1938, and each third year thereafter." That
adjusted declared value enters into the,'computation of the excess
profits tax under §§ 600 and 601 of the Internal Revenue Code.

ably to circumscribe its powers to establish a convenient

Nor do we have here any lack of that territorial uniformity which is required by Art. I, § 8 of the Constitution.

1. The National Labor Relations Act does not forbid or penalize expression by an employer to his employees of his views on labor
policies. P. 476.
2. Conduct, though evidenced in part by speech, may amount in
connection with other circumstances to coercion within the meaning of the Act. In determining whether an employer actually
interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees, the Board
may look at what it said as well as what it did. P. 477.
3. Where the Board specifically found that certain spoken and posted
utterances by the employer were unfair labor practices, the adequacy of which finding was doubtful if the utterances were separated from their background, and it was not certain from the
Board's decision that its conclusion was based on the whole course
of conduct during the period in question, of which the utterances
were a part, held, that the case must be returned to the Board for
a redetermination. P. 479.
