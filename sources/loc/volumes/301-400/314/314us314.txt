AMERICAN SURETY COMPANY OF NEW YORK
v. BETHLEHEM NATIONAL BANK ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE, CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
THIRD CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

No. 29. Argued November 12, 1941.-Decided December 8, 1941.
1. In making the "ratable" distribution of assets of an insolvent national bank required by R. S. 5236, dividends must be declared
proportionately upon the amounts of all claims, as they stood on
the date of insolvency. P. 317.
"2.Where a claim against an insolvent national bank secured by a
surety bond is paid in part by collateral and by dividends from the
estate and the remainder by the surety company, the surety is
subrogated to the right of the creditor in future dividends, and its
proportion of future dividends is to be calculated, not upon the basis
of what it paid, but upon the amount of the original claim. P. 318.
116 F. 2d 75, reversed.
CERTIORARI,

312 U. S. 677, to review the reversal of a-

judgment of the District Court fixing dividends in the
winding up of an insolvent national bank.
Mr. Rutledge Slattery, with whom Messrs. George P.
Williams, Jr. and Frank P. Slattery were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. George P. Barse, with whom Messrs. H. P. McFadden and Lee Roy Stover and Miss Harriet Buckingham
were on the brief, for respondents.
The claim of the surety for reimbursement from the
principal, or from the estate of the principal, must be
measured by the amount paid by the surety under the
bond, irrespective of whether reimbursement is sought
upon a claim of indemnity or a claim of subrogation.
The amount of the provable claim for dividend purposes
is the amount owing to the claimant by the bank as of the
date of closing. Merrill v. National Bank, 173 U. S.131,

It would be inequitable to the general creditors of the
bank to allow the surety, by subrogation or otherwise, a
claim, as the basis of dividends, in the full amount of
the deposit of the Commonwealth at the time of the
suspension or closing of the bank.
The deposit balance to the credit of the Commonwealth on the date of the bank's closing was more than
double the amount permitted by the state statute, and
to the extent of that excess was illegal. A claimant seeking subrogation must act fairly and equitably and be free
from fault in the transaction in connection with which
he claims subrogation.
In balancing the equities, the general depositors and
creditors of the bank are entitled to have the benefits of
the surety bond, rather than to have it weighed in the
balance against them.
The surety bond must be considered as an asset of the
bank in receivership.
Merrill v. National Bank, 173 U. S. 131, to the extent
applicable here, supports the position of respondents.
Mr. W. Page Dame, Jr. filed a brief on behalf of the
U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., as amicus curiae, urging
reversal.
'MR. JUsTIcE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the

Court
The facts of this case axe simple. The Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania had $135,000 on deposit in the Bethlehem
National Bank. This deposit was secured by a $125,000
bond, upon which the plaintiff was surety, and by a pledge

of government bonds having a par value of $12,000. The
bank became insolvent, and a receiver was appointed.
Thereafter, the Commonwealth obtained, in round figures,
$12,500 from the sale of the collateral and $54,000 as a
40% dividend on its claim, a total of $66,500. The remaining $68,500 was paid by the surety, thereby fully satisfying
the Commonwealth's claim. The present suit arose out
of three further dividends, of 20%, 10%, and 5%, respectively, declared by the' receiver. The surety sought dividend payments on the basis of the original indebtedness,
that is, $135,000. The receiver insisted that the extent
of the surety's participation must be measured by the sum
actually expended to discharge its principal's obligation,
to wit, $68,500. Reversing the decision of the District
Court, 33 F. Supp. 722, the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit upheld the receiver's contention. 116
F. 2d 75. In view of conflicting expressions by the lower
courts upon a question so important in the liquidation
of national banks, cf. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Cox, 104
F. 2d 354; Ward v. First National Bank, 76 F. 2d 256;
Fouts v. Maryland Casualty Co., 30 F. 2d 357, we brought
the case here. 312 U. S. 677.
The National Bank Act provides for the "ratable" distribution of assets of insolvent national banks. R. S.
§ 5236; 12 U. S. C. § 194. The question for decision is
therefore one of federal law. Deitrick v. Greaney, 309
U. S. 190, 200-01; Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonyille, 173 U. S. 131; Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, 161
U. S. 275; Cook County Nat. Bank v. United States, 107
U. S. 445, 448. Congress has seen fit not to anticipate by
specific rules solution of problems that inevitably arise in
national bank liquidations. Instead, it chose achievement
of a "just and equal distribution" of an insolvent bank's
assets through the operation of familiar equitable doctrines evolved by the courts. Davis v. Elmira Savings
Bank, 161 U. S. 275, 284; Jenkins v. National Surety Co.,

AMER. SURETY CO. v. BETHLEHEM BANK.

Opinion of the Court.

277 U. S. 258, 267. Among the oldest of these doctrines
is the rule of subrogation whereby "one who has been
compelled to pay a debt which ought to have been paid
by another is entitled to exercise all the remedies which
the creditor possessed against that other." Sheldon, Subrogation (2d ed.) § 11; see Hampton v. Phipps, 108 U. S.
260, 263; Hodgson v. Shaw, 3 Myl. & K. 183, 191; Hayes
v. Ward, 4 Johns. Ch. 123, 130.
Here the surety was compelled to pay to the Commonwealth $68,500 which ought to have been paid by the
bank.. Of course, it succeeds to the Commonwealth's right
to receive payment of $68,500 from the bank-and in no
event can the surety receive more. But as a means of
enforcing this right the Commonwealth was entitled to
share in all future dividends on the basis of its original
claim of $135,000. Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, 173 U. S.131. Succeeding to the creditor's right, the
surety also succeeds to the creditor's means for enforcing
it. The surety is a special kind of secured creditor. For
its claim against the principal is secured by its right of
subrogation to the remedies of the creditor which it has
been compelled to pay. Of course, this right can be
availed of only by a surety alert in discharging its duty,
Jenkins v. National Surety Co., 277 -U.S.258, 267, and
one not guilty of inequitable conduct, United States v.
Ryder, 110 U. S.729, 737. In other respects, a right of
subrogation is as much in the nature of a security as is a
mortgage.
A "ratable" distribution requires that dividends be declared proportionately upon the amount of all claims as
they stand on the date of the insolvency. This is settled
law. White v. Knox, 111 U. S. 784,787; Merrillv. National
Bank of Jacksonville, supra, at 143; Ticonic Bank v.
Sprague, 303 U. S.406, 411. "The distribution is to be
'ratable' on the claims as proved or adjudicated, that is,

318

OCTOBER TERM, 1941.
Opinion of the Court.

314 U. S.

on one rule of proportion applicable to all alike. In order
to be 'ratable' the claims must manifestly be estimated
as of the same point of time, and that date has been
adjudged to be the date of the declaration of insolvency."
Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, supra, at 143.
The basis of participation in the bank's assets by the Commonwealth was $135,000, the amount of the claim on the
date of insolvency. The amount of the claim having been
thus fixed on the date of insolvency, it did not shrink
because of the extraneous circumstance of the creditor's
forethought in securing partial satisfaction of its loss by
going against the collateral and the surety.
To permit the surety to stand in the shoes of the secured
creditor whose claim it has paid does not prejudice the
rights of the general creditors. The extent of their participation in the distribution of the Bank's assets was fixed
on the day it became insolvent. The surety will receive
no greater share than would have been received by the
Commonwealth had it not been for the circumstance
that its claim was secured by a surety's bond. If, for one
reason or another, the surety had withheld payment to the
Commonwealth, the latter would have continued to receive dividends on the full amount of its claim, or if,
on a nice calculation, the surety had at the outset satisfied its principal's obligation, it would have been entitled
to share on the basis of the full amount. On the other
hand, if the surety's participation should be limited to the
extent now urged by the receiver, the other creditors would
profit solely because of fortuitous circumstances and without any relation to reasons of intrinsic fairness. The extent of the participation of the surety, and therefore that
of the other creditors, would depend on how, when, and
against whom the secured creditor presses its claim. Cf.
In re Thompson, 300 F. 215, 217-18; Pace v. Pace, 95 Va.
792, 799, 30 S. E. 361. Such a result leaves too much to

AMER. SURETY CO. v. BETHLEHEM BANK. 319

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting.

caprice or accident and is wholly at variance with the guiding criterion of "ratable' distribution.1
A final consideration needs mention. The receiver cites
several instances in which the Comptroller of the Currency
has stated that the basis of a surety's claim is to be
measured by the amounts it has expended. But there is
wanting here any long-continued practice which establishes its own law within the permissible area of administrative action. Cf. Inland Waterways Corp. v. Young,
309 U. S. 517, 524-25.

Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting:

The only virtue possessed by Merrill v. National Bank
of Jacksonville, 173 U. S. 131, is the fact that it has been
on the books for over forty years. It held that a secured
creditor could receive dividends on the-fact amount of
his claim even though that claim had been reduced by
the value of the collateral between the date of insolvency
and the date of distribution. That rule of distribution
is inequitable and unfair 'to the run of depositors. It
gives an advantage to the secured creditor unwarranted
'fReflecting the special policy of bankruptcy legislation favoring the
general creditor against the secured creditor, the rule prevails in hank-'
ruptcy that dividends upon the claims of secured creditors "shall be,
paid only on the unpaid balance." § 57 (h), 30 Stat. 544, 560, 11
U. S. C. § 93 (h); 14 Stat. 517, 526. It is settled, however, that the
"bankruptcy" rule is inapplicable to the distribution of assets of insolvent national banks. Merril v. National Bank of Jacksonville, 173
U. S. 131. There is no occasion to regxamine the correctness of that
decision, the authority of which has never been questioned here and
was again recognized very recently. Ticonic Bank v. Sprague, 303
U. S. 406, 412. Although the National Bank Act has been amended
many times since its original enactment in 1864, 13 Stat. 114, the provision governing distribution of dividends has remained substantially
intact. The construction given the provision -in the Merrill case has
been left unchanged by Congress.

by any provision of his contract. For it treats the claim
as wholly unpaid even though it has been partially discharged by liquidation of the collateral. The impact on
other creditors is oppressive. Under the rule of the Merrill case, a depositor with a $10,000 claim, secured by
$5,000 worth of collateral, will be wholly paid if the insolvent bank pays a 50% dividend. On the other hand,
an unsecured depositor with a $10,000 claim salvages
under those circumstances only $5,000. A rule of distribution which sanctions such a discriminatory result
violates the requirement for "ratable" dividends prescribed by the National Banking Act. R. S. § 5236, 12
U. S. C. § 194. This is no occasion, however, to elaborate
on the point. It was fully covered in its historical and
legal aspects by the dissenting opinions of Mr. Justice
White and Mr. Justice Gray in the Merrill case.
The majority of the Court was of the view that whatever might be the power of Congress under the bankruptcy
clause of the Constitution, the adoption of the bankruptcy
rule 1 in equity would be an invasion of "prior" contract
rights (173 U. S. at p. 146)-an impairment of obligation
1

It should be noticed that the bankruptcy rule, now codified (Bankruptcy Act § 57 (h), 11 U. S. C. § 93 (h)), which allows the secured
creditor to receive dividends only on the balance remaining after the
value of the security has been deducted from the claim, did not derive
from a special statutory provision. As pointed out by Mr. Justice
Gray in his dissent in the Merrill case (173 U. S. at pp. 174-175) the
Bankruptcy Act of 1841 (5 Stat. 440) had no such provision. Yet its
requirement for "pro rata" distribution (§ 5) was recognized by Mr.
Justice Story, its draftsman, as'permitting a secured creditor to prove
only for the balance of his claim as remained after crediting the value
of the security. Ex parte City Bank of New Orleans, 3 How. 292,
315. That rule of construction followed the long established English
bankruptcy rule. See Mr. Justice White, dissenting, 173 U. S. at pp.
153-155. As stated by Lord Eldon in Ex parte Smith, 2 Rose Bank.
Rep. 63, 64, until the secured creditor's claim has been reduced by
deducting the value of the security "it is impossible correctly to say
what the actual Amount of it is."

of contract. And the reason for that conclusion was based
on the theory that since "the creditor's rights in the trust
fund are established when the fund is created, collections
subsequently made from, or payments subsequently
made on, collateral, cannot operate to change the relations
between the creditor and his co-creditors in respect of their
rights in the fund." (p. 140.) For that reason it was
held that the claims of creditors are to be "determined as
of the date of the declaration of insolvency." (p. 147.)
There is serious question whether that foundation has not
been swept away by William Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed,
245 U: S. 597.
Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the Weed case (p. 602):
"But when the courts without statute take possession of
all the assets of a corporation under a bill like the present
and so make it impossible to collect debts except from the'
court's hands, they have no warrant for excluding creditors, or for introducing supposed equities other than
those determined by the contracts that the debtor was
content to make and the creditors to accept. In order
to make a distribution possible they must of necessity limit
the time for the proof of claims. But they have no authority to give to the filing of the bill the effect of the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy so as to exclude any previously made and lawful claim that matures within a reasonable time before distribution can be made."
That theory runs counter to the assumption in the
Merrill case (173 U. S. at p. 136) that a creditor acquires
a "vested interest in the trust fund" antedating distribution. For if that assumption were valid, the claim in the
Weed case, which had matured after the proceedings had
been instituted, would have been disallowed. Such an
assumption would likewise fail to take heed of the admonition of Mr. Justice Holmes that "supposed equities other
than those determined by the contracts that the debtor
was content to make and the creditors to accept" are not
to be recognized.

DouoAus, J., dissenting.

314 U. S.

Yet, assuming arguendo that the premise of the Merrill
case has survived, the answer to the proposition that application of the bankruptcy rule would result in impairment of obligation of contract was completely answered
by Mr. Justice White (173 U. S. at p. 152): ". . . the
preferential right arising from the contract of pledge is
in nowise impaired by compelling the creditor to first exercise his preference against the security received from
the debtor, and thus confine him to the specific advantage
derived from his contract. Further, however, as the contract, construed in connection with the law governing it,
restricts the secured as well as the unsecured creditor to
a ratable dividend from the general assets, the secured
creditor is prevented from enhancing the advantage obtained as a result of the contract for security, by proving
his claim as if no security existed, since to allow him to
so do would destroy the rule of ratable division, subject
and subordinate to which the contract was made." And
see Glenn, Liquidation (1935) § 530.
This analysis of the Merrill case is germane to the present problem not merely to focus the historical setting of
the rule which we are asked to enforce. It is especially
important because we are now asked to extend that rule
to a special type of unsecured creditor.
The surety who seeks its protection has an unsecured
claim for $68,500. It seeks to gain the advantages which
a secured creditor with a claim of $135,000 would have,
i. e. the right to receive dividends on that basis. To deny
the surety that preference would be no invasion of "prior
contract rights," no impairment of obligation of contract,
under the theory of the majority in the Merrill case.
This surety neither has nor had any claim which was
secured. Nor did it have any fixed and liquidated claim
at the date of the declaration of insolvency. Its claim
was always unsecured and it matured, as in the Weed case,
after the appointment of the receiver. Nevertheless, this

DOuGLAS, J., dissenting.

surety, though it would fail to gain the preferred position
of a secured creditor under the test of the Merrill case, is
allowed to reach that position through the back door of
subrogation.
It is ordinarily true that a surety succeeds to all of the
rights and remedies of the creditor, including the latter's
priority. Lidderdale's Executors v. Executor of Robinson, 12 Wheat. 594. But that is no inexorable rule. As
this Court stated in Memphis & Little Rock R. v. Dow,
120 U. S. 287, 301-302, "The right of subrogation is not
founded on contract. It is a creature of equity; is enforced solely for the purpose of accomplishing the ends of
substantial justice." In determining whether it would
be fair or equitable to allow the subrogation to the full
extent of the creditor's rights and remedies, consideration
will, of course, be given to the prejudice, if any, suffered
by other creditors. But the mere fact that the other
creditors will not be worse off than if the surety's principal
had pressed the claim is not the sole solvent of the problem. We are not dealing with a mechanical rule. The
question remains whether justice requires, or policy permits, the surety to succeed to his principal's privileged
position.
Such considerations frequently are a barrier to any subrogation; at other times they may cut down the rights
of the surety and give him lesg than his principal could
exact. Illustrations of the former are German Bank v.
UnitedStates, 148 U. S.573, where subrogation was denied
because it arose from conduct which was tortious; and
United States v. Ryder, 110 U. S. 729, where a surety on
recognizance bail was denied subrogation to the rights of
the United States. In the Ryder case, subrogation was
denied because, inter alia, its allowance "would be to aid
the bail to get rid of their obligation, and to relieve them
from the motives to exert themselves in securing the appearance of the principal. Subrogation to the latter

remedies would clearly be against public policy by subverting, as far as it might prove effectual, the very object
and purpose of the recognizance." Id., p. 737.
Closer in point, however, are those cases which award
the surety less rights than his principal had. Thus, South
Philadelphia State Bank's Insolvency, 295 Pa. 433, 145
A. 520, held that while a surety was entitled to be subrogated to the~rights of a State against an insolvent bank,
the surety did not, in absence of statute,2 acquire the
State's priority. See Arnold, An Inequitable Preference
in Favor of Surety Companies, 36 W. Va. L. Q. 278; (note)
81 U. Pa. L. Rev. 441. The theory of that case is that
"the State's right to a preference over other creditors,
being a sovereign right enjoyed for the benefit of all the
people, cannot be transferred to individuals except by express legislative sanction." (295 Pa. at p. 440.) Though
that case represents the minority view in the state courts,'
it is recognition of the healthy principle that application
of the rule of subrogation should not be reduced to a conceptualistic formula.
The sweep of that principle is illustrated by Memphis
& Little Rock R. Co. v. Dow, supra. In that case the prior
lien creditor had a claim with interest at 8%. To allow
the surety the same rate of interest would not have put the
junior lienor in a worse plight. But this Court disallowed
,that rate, pointing out (120 U. S. at p. 30 2 ) that the surety
was entitled only to reimbursement. A similar approach
in this case would be to ascertain the equities of the sureBy statute a surety of the United States succeeds to the latter's
R. S. § 3468, 31 U. S. C. § 193. It should be noted, however, that though the United States has priority against an insolvent
(R. S. § 3466, 31 U. S. C. § 191) that priority has been- held not to
extend to an insolvent national bank. Cook Cninty Nat'l Bank v.
United States, 107 U. S.445.

priority.

ty's claim, not by looking for the principal's rights under
its contract but for reasons why this surety should be accorded priority over other unsecured creditors. Equity
has regard not only for the rights of other creditors (Jenkins v. NationalSurety Co., 277 U. S. 258) but also for the
stake which the surety has and which it is asking a court
of equity to protect. A court of equity should neither
"come to the aid of one" whose equity is "subordinate
until claims superior in equity" have been satisfied (American Surety Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Mfg. Co., 296
U. S. 133, 136), nor create superior equities on behalf of
one who can show no more compelling reasons for preferred treatment than can those with whom he competes.
Under such an approach, this surety would be denied a
superior equity.
Here, the surety has only an unsecured claim of $68,500.
Any reason for continuation of the discrimination against
the general depositors of this bank disappeared when the
surety's creditor was paid. No equity has been suggested
for allowing this surety preferred treatment. It was paid
to assume the risk of insolvency of the bank. It was paid
by the bank itself. And it has not been shown that it
charged a lower rate because of the rule of the Merrill case.
In view of those circumstances, it should not be allowed
the lion's share. It is entitled to reimbursement but certainly in no greater an amount than the run of depositors.
It is no answer to say that such a result would give the general depositors a windfall. Unless subrogation is to be a.
mechanical formula, this surety should be required to
establish its special equity to preferred treatment-reasons why it, unlike any other unsecured creditor, should
enjoy the benefits of the discriminatory rule of the Merrill case.
Finally, it is suggested that if the surety is not allowed
this preference, much will be left to "caprice or accident,"

since the surety would have been entitled to share on the
basis of the full amount if it had satisfied the creditor's
obligation at the very outset. The answer to that is that
we would then have to determine whether the Merrill
case has survived the Weed case (See Clark, Proof by
Secured Creditors in Insolvency and Receivership Proceedings, 15 Ill. L. Rev. 171), and, if so, whether it should
be overruled. It is sufficient at this time to say that, in
view of the flimsy basis on which the Merrill case rests,
and the oppressive nature of the rule it fashioned, it should
not be extended.
