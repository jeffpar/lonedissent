the plug, when the latch maintaining the closed circuit
is thermostatically released.
The commercially exploited device, because of the differences in its structure from that shown by Mead, is the
more compact and easily operated. Its utility as a lighter
to be located on the dash of an automobile, which is said
to be the merit of the Mead invention, is obvious. If the
improvements resulting in such utility involved invention,
it is not the invention of Mead. If they exhibited only the
skill of the art, their success cannot be relied on to establish
invention by Mead, who did not show or make them. Tho
case is therefore not one for the application of the doctrine
that commercial success or the manifest satisfaction of
a felt need will turn the scale in favor of invention.

1. As construed by the highest court of the State, the purchaser is
liable for the sales tax imposed by North Dakota Laws of 1937, c.
249, and this construction is controlling. P. 99.

by thebank in the course of its operations. P. 99.

capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom," shall be exempt from state taxation, the words quoted do hot
delimit the scope of the exemption. P. 99.
4. Nothing in the legislative history of ยง 26, nor of similar exemption
clauses in other statutes, requires a result contrary to that here
reached. P. 100.
