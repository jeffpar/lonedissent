TOWNSHIP OF HILLSBOROUGH ET AL. v.
CROMWELL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 305. Argued December 13, 14, 1945.-Decided January 28, 1946.
1. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Judicial Code § 274 (d),
a federal district court has jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the
purpose of determining the validity of a state tax assessment under
the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment, where the constitutional rights of the complainant
can not be protected adequately by proceedings in the state courts.
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293, differentiated. Pp. 622-624.
2. Where a taxpayer who has been singled out for discriminatory
taxation may not obtain equalization under the state law by reduction of his own assessment but is restricted to proceedings against
other members of his class for the purpose of having their taxes
increased, the state remedy is not adequate to protect his rights
under the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 623.
3. A taxpayer brought suit in a federal district court for a declaratory judgment to determine the validity of a state tax assessment
under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. There was uncertainty concerning the meaning of the local law. He could have appealed originally to the
state board of tax appeals, but that board had no right to pass
on constitutional questions. Its judgments could be reviewed by
the state supreme court by certiorari, but the allowance of such
a writ was discretionary. The refusal of a writ of certiorari by
the state supreme court could not be judicially reviewed by the
state court of errors and appeals. When the district court ruled on
a motion to dismiss, the time for appeal to the state board of tax
appeals had expired. When the district court rendered judgment,
there had been a recent authoritative interpretation of the local
law by the state court. Held:
(a) There was such uncertainty surrounding the adequacy of
the state remedy as to justify the federal district court in retaining
jurisdiction of the cause. P. 625.
(b) It was proper for the federal district court to proceed to
decide the case on its merits, even though the decision was not on
federal arounds but on the ground that the assessment was not in

CERTIORARI, post, p. 704, to review affirmance of a judgment of a district court, 56 F. Supp. 41, denying a motion
to dismiss and declaring certain state tax assessments to
be null and void.

Mr. Harry E. Walburg, with whom Mr. Samuel I. Kessler was on the brief, for petitioners.
Messrs. CharlesE. Hughes, Jr. and Shelton Pitney, with
whom Mr. William J. Brennan, Jr. was on the brief, for
respondent.
Mr. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This action was brought by respondent under the
Declaratory Judgment Act, Judicial Code, § 274 (d), 28
U. S. C. § 400, to have declared null and void certain assessments on intangible personal property entered for the
years 1940 and 1941 by the Collector of Hillsborough
Township, Somerset County, New Jersey.1 The jurisdiction of the federal court in New Jersey was invoked by
I The assessments call for tax payments of nearly $7,000,000 for
each year as compared with the Township's budget of something like
$97,000 annually. Prior to these assessments the net assessed valuation for taxation of all property assessed, both real and personal, in

the Township amounted to $3,117,863 for 1940 and $3,139,020 for
1941. The resulting tax rate was 3.12 per cent for 1940 and 3.10
per cent for 1941. The additional assessments against respondent

apparently would have increased the valuation of the township tax
ratables by $221,940,438 for each of the two tax years, though it
would not have affected the tax rates for those years.

reason of diversity of citizenship and the allegation that
the taxing authorities had consistently, systematically
and intentionally singled out respondent for discriminatory treatment in the assessment of taxes for which she
was without remedy under the laws and decisions of New
Jersey. It was prayed that the assessments be declared
invalid as in contravention of the due process and equal
protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and of
the provisions of applicable New Jersey statutes to which
we will later refer. The District Court denied a motion
to dismiss and gave judgment for respondent. 56 F. Supp.
41. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 149 F. 2d
617. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari
which we granted because the asserted conflict of that
decision with Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman,
319 U. S. 293, raised an important problem concerning
the relationship between the federal courts and state taxing authorities.
Sec. 267 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 384, provides
that suits in equity shall not be sustained in the federal
courts "in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete
remedy may be had at law." That principle has long been
recognized as having "peculiar force" in cases where the
federal courts were asked to enjoin the collection of a state
tax. Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S. 521, 525, and cases
cited. "The scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate
the federal courts, and a proper reluctance to interfere by
injunction with their fiscal operations, require that such
relief should be denied in every case where the asserted
federal right may be preserved without it." Id., p. 525.
Where the remedy at law is "plain, adequate, and complete," it is the one which must be pursued even for the
protection of any federal right. That practice of the federal equity courts was given further recognition and sanc-

tion by Congress in the Johnson Act, 48 Stat. 775, as
amended, 50 Stat. 738, § 24 (1) of the Judicial Code, 28
U. S. C. § 41 (1), which provides that "no district court
shall have jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin, suspend, or
restrain the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax imposed by or pursuant to the laws of any State where a
plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or
in equity in the courts of such State." It was against that
background that we held in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock
Co. v. Huffman, supra, that the policy which led federal
courts of equity to refrain from enjoining the collection
of allegedly unlawful state taxes should likewise govern
the exercise of their discretion in withholding relief under
the Declaratory Judgment Act.
The Circuit Court of Appeals fully recognized the principle of the Huffman case, but concluded that the state procedure was not "speedy, efficient or adequate" to protect
the federal right against discriminatory state taxation. It
is around that conclusion that the first phase of this controversy. turns.
The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the individual from state action which
selects him out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting
him to taxes not imposed on others of the same class. The
right is the right to equal treatment. He may not complain if equality is achieved by increasing the same taxes
of other members of the class to the level of his own. The
constitutional requirement, however, is not satisfied if
a State does not itself remove the discrimination, but
imposes on him against whom the discrimination has been
directed the burden of seeking an upward revision of the
taxes of other members of the class. Sioux City Bridge

28-29. The courts of New Jersey in a long line of decisions ' have held that a taxpayer who has been singled
out for discriminatory taxation may not obtain equalization by reduction of his own assessment. His remedy is
restricted to proceedings against other members of his
class for the purpose of having their taxes increased. The
rule was stated in Royal Mfg. Co. v. Board of Equalization, 76 N. J. L. 402, 70 A. 978, aff'd 78 N. J. L. 337, 74 A.
525, as follows: ". . . the county boards are required to
secure taxation of all property at its true value; so that
the fact that the property of A is assessed at its true value
and the property of other taxpayers within the same
district is assessed below its true value, affords A no ground
for demanding a reduction of his valuation, though it does
entitle him to apply for an increase in the valuation of the
others." 76 N. J. L. pp. 404-405. On the basis of that rule
it is plain that the state remedy is not adequate to protect
respondent's rights under the federal Constitution.
It is argued, however, that in 1933 the New Jersey
courts adopted a different rule when Central R. Co. v.
State Tax Dept. (Thayer-Martin), 112 N. J. L. 5, 169 A.
489, was decided by the Court of Errors and Appeals. In
that case the court did entertain an objection that the
particular tax assessment violated the rule of Sioux City
Bridge Co. v. Dakota County,, supra. It found that the
complaining taxpayer had not shown that a discrimination within the meaning of our cases existed. So it is
argued that as the highest court in New Jersey recognized
the federal rule, the federal District Court should have
remitted respondent to her remedy in the New Jersey

courts. There is, however, a two-fold difficulty with that
position.
In the first place, the same judge who wrote the opinion
for the Court of Errors and Appeals in the Thayer-Martin
case wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court of New
Jersey a year later in Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. State Board,
12 N. J. Misc. 673, 174 A. 359. The taxpayer contended
that the state board of tax appeals erred in refusing to admit evidence of discrimination. The argument was that
the rule of Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, supra,
should be followed and the holding of Royal Mfg. Co. v.
Board of Equalization,supra,should be disapproved. The
Supreme Court of New Jersey declined to allow a writ of
certiorari to review the judgments of the state board of
tax appeals. It did not mention the Thayer-Martin case,
but followed Royal Mfg. Co. v. Board of Equalization,
supra, saying that the New Jersey law on the point was
"settled and controlling." 12 N. J. Misc. p. 675. It, therefore, may well be true, as respondent says, that the court
in the Thayer-Martin case simply decided that the point
raised by the taxpayer was not supported by facts and
found it unnecessary to consider whether, if systematic
discrimination had been shown, New Jersey would have
afforded an adequate remedy. In any event, there is such
uncertainty concerning the New Jersey remedy as to make
it speculative (Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 68) whether
the State affords full protection to the federal rights. In
the second place, the state board of tax appeals to which
respondent might have appealed concededly has no right
to pass on constitutional questions.' Its judgments may
be reviewed by the New Jersey Supreme Court by certiorari. The allowance of that writ, however, is not a matter

of right, but purely discretionary.' And the refusal of a
writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court may not be judicially reviewed by the Court of Errors and Appeals." Accordingly we conclude that there was such uncertainty surrounding the adequacy of the state remedy as to justify
the District Court in retaining jurisdiction of the cause.
While the charges of discrimination in the complaint were
denied, the jurisdiction of the District Court is determined
by the allegations of the bill (Hartv. B. F. Keith Vaudeville
Exchange, 262 U. S. 271) which here were substantial.
This brings us to the second phase of the controversy.
Neither the District Court nor the Circuit Court of Appeals decided the case on federal grounds. They held in
reliance on Duke Power Co. v. State Board, 129 N. J. L.
449, 30 A. 2d 416, 131 N. J. L. 275, 36 A. 2d 201, that the
assessments were invalid under the New Jersey statutes.
In that case, as in the present one, property "omitted in
the assessment" was attempted to be assessed by the
County Board against the taxpayer after April 1st of each
of the tax years involved without notice and hearing.'

Stat. § 54 :3-20 provides in part, "On the written
complaint of the collector, or any taxpayer of the taxing district or of
the governing body thereof, that property specified has been omitted
in the assessment, the county board, on five days' notice in writing
to the owner by the party complaining, and after due examination
and bearing, may enter the omitted property on the duplicate by
judgment rendered within ten days after the hearing, a transcript
whereof shall be furnished by the board to the collector, who shall
amend his duplicate accordingly."
A different procedure is provided by § 54 :3-20 for inclusion of
property "omitted by the assessor." For a discussion of the difference
between the. two types of assessments see Duke Power Co. v. State
Board, supra, 129 N. J. L. pp. 452-455. At p. 455, the court said:
"If property in a taxing district is omitted by the assessor it must
be added to the assessment before April 1st. Its addition decreases

Opinion of the Court.

The assessment was set aside as not being in conformity
with the statute. And it was held that the remedial
statutes,' designed to cure irregularities in assessing or
levying taxes, "do not apply where the statute for the
addition of property omitted from the assessment is not
complied with." 129 N. J. L. p. 457.
Petitioner argues that it is clear from Duke Power Co.

the state tribunals for failure of petitioner to follow the
procedure required by the New Jersey statutes and that
the federal court should have required her to pursue it.
the amount of taxes to be raised since the ratables are thereby increased. The taxpayer is not embarrassed. He knows he will have
a tax to pay and is liable anyway even if the property was not
included in the assessment. However, if property is added to the
assessment after the rate has been fixed it gives rise to a municipal
windfall. There is no harm in this if there were due notice and a fair
hearing by the County Board and a judicial determination by it"
I Sec. 54 :4-58 provides:
"No tax, assessment or water rate imposed or levied in this state
shall be set aside or reversed in any action, suit or proceeding for any
irregularity or defect in form, or illegality in assessing, laying or levying any such tax, assessment or water rate, or in the proceeding for
its collection if the person against whom or the property upon which
it is assessed or laid is, in fact, liable to taxation, assessment or imposition of the water rate, in respect to the purposes for which the
tax, assessment or rate is levied, assessed or laid."
Sec. 54 : 4-59 provides:
"The court in which any action, suit or proceeding is or shall be
pending to review any such tax, assessment or water rate shall amend
all irregularities, errors or defects, and may if necessary ascertain
and determine the sum for which the person or property was legally
liable and by order or decree fix the amount thereof. The sum so
fixed shall be the amount of tax, assessment or water rate for which
the person or property shall be liable."
The court in Duke Power Co. v. State Board, supra, 129 N. J. L.
p. 457, stated that "the remedial statutes we do not find to have been
a substitute for proper assessment. Their application has been only
in instances where property has been omitted by the assessor or has
been assessed in the name of one other than the true owner."

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

326 U. S.

We have held that where a federal constitutional question
turns on the interpretation of local law and the local law
is in doubt, the proper procedure is for the federal court
to hold the case until a definite determination of the local
law can be made by the state courts. Railroad Commis-

sion v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496; Chicago v. Fieldcrest
Dairies,316 U. S. 168; Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin,
323 U. S. 101. The latter case involved a suit in which
the constitutionality of a Connecticut tax was challenged.
There was uncertainty concerning the meaning of the local
law. Under one construction the constitutional issues
would fall; and in any event a decision by the state courts
would cause the constitutional issues to be formulated in
an authoritative rather than a speculative way. But it was
clear that there was available a state remedy to which the
complainant could resort on the remand of the cause. In
the present case it appears that respondent's opportunity
to appeal to the State Board of Tax Appeals 8 had expired
even before the District Court ruled on the motion to dismiss." And it is not clear that today respondent has open
any adequate remedy in the New Jersey courts for challenging the assessments on local law grounds."

9 The present bill was filed in July, 1941, the answer in September,
1941, and the motion to dismiss in November, 1941. The order denying the motion to dismiss was made in August, 1942.
10 It seems that under certain circumstances certiorari to the Supreme Court may be had in lieu of an appeal to the State Board of
Tax Appeals. It was held in Schwartz v. Essez County Board, supra
note 3, that lack of jurisdiction of the county board or irregularity in
its proceedings may be tested by certiorari. 130 N. J. L. p. 178. And
see State v. Clothier, 30 N. J. L. 351. But as we have seen, note 4

before the District Court rendered judgment,1 1 gave an
authoritative interpretation of the local law. Hence, the
reason for holding the case in Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, supra, and remitting the complainant to the
state courts for determination of the local law question
no longer was existent here.
It follows a fortiori that the bill should not have been
dismissed. As stated in Greene v. Louisville & I. R. Co.,
244 U. S. 499, 520, "A remedy at law cannot be considered
adequate, so as to prevent equitable relief, unless it covers
the entire case made by the bill in equity." Though the
availability of a state remedy on the local law question be
assumed to exist, so much uncertainty surrounds the New
Jersey remedy to protect the taxpayer's federal right
that a refusal to dismiss the bill was a proper exercise of
discretion. Thus, however the case may be viewed, the
exceptional circumstances which we have noted take it
out of the general rule of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co.
v. Huffman, supra. The District Court, therefore, properly proceeded to decide the case on the merits. That it
placed its decision on local law grounds is not objectionable. For it is well settled that where the federal court
has jurisdiction, it may pass on the whole case and agreeably with the desired practice decide it on local law questions, without reaching the constitutional issues. Siler v.

No. 289. Argued January 3, 4, 1946.-Decided January 28, 1946.
In 1925, decedent established two spendthrift trusts for his children,
transferring securities to each trust and reserving the power to
amend with the consent of the trustee and beneficiary. In 1934 he
added securities to each trust. He paid gift taxes on these transfers.
Learning in 1937 that, under a recent decision of this Court, the
reservation of the power to amend brought the corpus of the trust
into the settlor's estate for estate tax purposes, he renounced the
power to amend. He died in 1938 at the age of 82. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the corpus of each trust in
his estate and collected the estate tax on it. The executors sued
for a refund. Both the district court and the circuit court of
appeals found that decedent established the trusts to meet the
necessities of his children by giving them property freed of all
claims, tax or otherwise, and that he renounced the power to amend
