CASES ADJUDGED
IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.

BAILEY v. ANDERSON, STATE HIGHWAY
COMMISSIONER.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA.

No. 49. Argued October 15, 1945.-Decided November 5, 1945.
1. Section 1969j of the Virginia Code of 1942 does not deny the due
process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to
a landowner upon whose land the state highway commissioner entered and constructed a highway in advance of the appointment of
commissioners and before they could view the land for the purpose
of fixing its fair value upon condemnation, since the landowner had
full opportunity for a hearing before the commissioners, and their
award was subject to a judicial review upon which the award
could be set aside if plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.
P. 205.
2. The question of the constitutionality of a claimed denial to the
landowner of interest on the value of the property from the time
of the taking is not properly presented upon the record in this case,
since it does not affirmatively appear that appellant raised that
question on the record or that the state supreme court passed
on it. P. 206.

Dismised.

compensation in a condemnation proceeding.

Opinion of the Court.

BernardB. Bailey, pro se.
Abram P. Staples, Attorney General of Virginia, for
appellee.
MR. CHIEF JUSTCE STONE delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Appellee, State Highway Commissioner of Virginia,
brought this proceeding in conformity to §§ 1969j (1)1969j (6) of the Virginia Code of 1942, to condemn appellant's land for use as a public highway. Acting under
§ 1969j (4), appellee entered on the land and constructed
the highway in advance of its condemnation. In the condemnation proceeding, begun in the circuit court within
sixty days after the completion of the highway, the Commissioners, appointed and acting pursuant to § 1969j (2),
after viewing the land, and hearing evidence, made an
award of $1,500 for the land occupied by the highway, and
of $6,500 Tor damages "resulting to the adjacent or other
property of the owner."
The Virginia Circuit Court confirmed the Commissioners' report, and by its decree directed that interest be paid
on the amount of the award from the date of the decree.
The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, without opinion, denied appellant's petition for a writ of error. The
case comes here on appeal, § 237 (a) Judicial Code, 28
U. S. C. § 344 (a), appellant assigning as error that
§§ 1969j (4) and 1969j (6), as applied to appellant, deny
to him the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. On examination of appellant's jurisdictional
statement we postponed the question of our jurisdiction to
the argument on the merits.
Appellant contends here, as he did in the state courts,
that § 1969j (4) infringes the asserted constitutional immunity by sanctioning appellee's entry upon, the land and
the alteration of its physical condition, in advance of the
appointment of the Commissioners and before they could

Opinion of the Court.

view the land for the purpose of fixing its fair value upon
condemnation. But it has long been settled that due
process does not require the condemnation of land to be
in advance of its occupation by the condemning authority,
provided only that the owner have opportunity, in the
course of the condemnation proceedings, to be heard and
to offer evidence as to the value of the land taken. Bragg
v. Weaver, 251 U. S. 57, 62, and cases cited; Joslin Co. v.
Providence, 262 U. S. 668, 677; Georgiav.Chattanooga,264
U. S.472,483. Its value may be fixed by viewers without
a hearing, after entry upon the land, if their award is subject to a review in which a trial upon evidence may be had.
Pearsonv. Yewdall, 95 U. S. 294,296; Backus v. FortStreet
Union Depot Co., 169 U. S. 557, 569; Bragg v. Weaver,
supra, 59, and cases cited; North Laramie Land Co. v.
Hoffman, 268 U. S. 276,284-285.
Here appellant was given full opportunity to be heard
and to introduce evidence before the Commissioners.
They could, upon the evidence submitted, take into account the alterations of the property after the taking and
before the view; such was their duty under the statute.
Their award is made subject to judicial review by § 1969j
(2), and upon such review may be set aside if plainly
wrong or without support in the evidence. Barnes v.
Tidewater R. Co., 107 Va. 263, 266-268, 58 S. E. 594;
Duncan v. State Highway Commission, 142 Va. 135,
146--148, 128 S. E. 546. In this we find no denial of due
process, and appellant's contention presents no substantial constitutional question, as the authorities cited

show.
Appellant also insists that the state court judgment
failed to include in the award interest from the date of
the occupation of his land by appellee; that the award
thus denied to him just compensation for the land taken,
in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. See Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Morris-

town, 276 U. S. 182. Appellant's petition in the circuit
court asked that the award include interest from the date
of taking. The circuit court, without explanation, rejected his claim for interest. But throughout the proceedings in the circuit court appellant made no claim to
interest on constitutional grounds, and made no attack
on the constitutionality of the award or the court's decree
because of the asserted denial of interest. Further, nothing appears in the record to indicate that the Commissioners' award of damages did not include the interest
claimed. Appellee argues that the applicable statutes
contemplate that the award shall include interest as compensation "for the damage and delay" from the time of
the occupation of the premises to the date of the Commissioners' report and for such further time within which
application may be made for judicial review, see City of
Richmond v. Goodwyn, 132 Va. 442,452-454,112 S. E. 787;
Export Leaf Tobacco Co. v. Richmond, 163 Va. 145, 155156, 175 S. E. 753. Nothing appears to the contrary.
Appellant, for the first time, assailed on constitutional
grounds the asserted denial of interest by his assignments
of error in the state Supreme Court of Appeals. The
assignments relating to interest failed to draw in question
the constitutional validity of any statute as is required
by § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code. The state Supreme
Court by its order refusing the writ of error declared that
upon consideration of the record it was of opinion that
the judgment below was "plainly right."
Inspection of the record does not show that, in denying
the writ of error, the state court passed upon any constitutional question not raised or passed upon in the
course of the proceedings below. Such appears not to be
its practice. Rule 22 of the Rules of the Supreme Court
of Appeals, 181 Va. lxxv; cf. Ward Co. v. HendersonWhite Co., 107 Va. 626, 628-629, 59 S. E. 476; Bliss v.
Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 50, 99 S. E. 593; Reynolds v. Adams,

Syllabus.

125 Va. 295, 314, 99 S. E. 695. On this record we cannot
say that the interest claimed was not included in the
award, or, if it was not, that the Supreme Court of Appeals
of Virginia, by denying writ of error, passed upon any
question of the constitutionality of such denial of interest,
not raised on the record or passed upon below. Unless
this affirmatively appears upon the record brought here
for review on appeal, this Court is without jurisdiction of
the appeal. Jacobi v. Alabama, 187 U. S. 133, 135-136;
Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McGrew, 188 U. S. 291, 309;
Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. McGuire, 196 U. S. 128, 131;
see Flournoy v. Wiener, 321 U. S. 253, 262-263, and cases
cited.
The appeal must be dismissed for want of any properly
presented substantial federal question.
Dismissed.

or decision of this case.
ASBURY HOSPITAL v. CASS COUNTY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH DAKOTA.

No. 35. Argued October 10, 11, 1945.-Decided November 5, 1945.
A statute of North Dakota requires corporations owning farm land,
except such as is reasonably necessary in the conduct of their
business, to dispose of it within 10 years from the effective
date of the Act. Farm land owned by any corporation in violation
of the Act is subject to escheat to the county wherein such land is
located, to be effected by a judicial proceeding to which the corporation must be a party. The county is required to dispose of the
land at public sale within one year after escheat and to pay the proceeds to the corporation. Appellant, a foreign corporation owning
farm land in North Dakota which it had acquired prior to the effective date of the Act, sought in the state courts a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality of the Act as applied to it. Held:
1. A corporation is not a "citizen" within the protection of the
