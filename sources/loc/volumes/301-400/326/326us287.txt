BOEHM v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 69. Argued October 19, 1945.--Decided November 13, 1945.
1. Treasury Regulations long continued without substantial change,
applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are
deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect
of law. P. 291.
2. To be -deductible in computing income tax under § 23 (e) of the
Revenue Act of 1936, a loss must have been sustained in fact during the taxable year. P. 292.
3. The determination of whether under § 23 (e) a loss was sustained
in a particular tax year requires consideration of all pertinent facts
and circumstances, regardless of their objective or subjective nature. P. 292.
The taxpayer's attitude and conduct, though not to be ignored,
are not decisive. P. 293.
4. Whether, within the meaning of § 23 (e), particular corporate stock
became worthless during a given taxable year is purely a question
of fact to be determined in the first instance by the Tax Court; and
the circumstance that the facts may be stipulated or undisputed
does not make this issue any the less factual in nature. P. 293.
5. A decision of the Tax Court which is "in accordance with law"
may not be set aside on review, even though different inferences
and conclusions might fairly have been drawn from the undisputed
facts. P. 293.
6. The taxpayer, has the burden of establishing that a claimed deductible loss was sustained in the taxable year. P. 294.
7. Upon the stipulated facts of this case, the Tax Court's conclusion
that the corporate stock in question did not become worthless in
1937, and that the taxpayer therefore sustained no deductible loss
in that year, is sustained. P. 294.
8. Remedying harshness in the operation of a Revenue Act is for
Congress, not the courts. P. 295.
146 F. 2d 553, affirmed.

the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency in income tax.
Mr. Louis Boehm, with whom Mr. B. D. Fischman was
on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Walter J. Cummings, Jr., with whom Acting Solicitor General Judson, Assistant Attorney General Clark,
Messrs. Sewall Key, I. Henry Kutz and Miss Helen R.
Carlosswere on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTCE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the
Court.
We are met here with the problem of whether the Tax
Court properly found that certain corporate stock did not
become worthless in 1937, thereby precluding the petitioning taxpayer from claiming a deductible loss in that
year under § 23 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1936.1
The facts, which are stipulated, show that the taxpayer
in 1929 bought 1,100 shares of Class A stock of the Hartman Corporation for $32,440. This corporation had been
formed to acquire the capital stock of an Illinois corporation, and its affiliates, engaged in the business of selling
furniture, carpets and household goods.
In April, 1932, the Hartman Corporation sent its stockholders a letter reporting that the current business depression had caused shrinkage of sales, decline in worth
of assets 2 and unprecedented credit and corporate losses.
Another letter sent the following month informed them
that business had not shown any improvement although
counteracting measures were being taken. Then on June
16, 1932, a federal court in Illinois appointed equity receivers upon the allegations of a creditor, which were adStat. 1648, 1659; 26 U. S. C. § 23 (e).
The balance sheet as of December 31, 1931, which accompanied
this letter, showed assets and liabilities of $15,401,097.97 and a total
net worth of $9,410,659.50.

mitted to be true by the Hartman Corporation, that the
company had sustained large liquidating and operating
losses from 1930 to 1932. 8'

Subsequently, on December 16, 1932, a stockholders'
derivative action, the so-called Graham suit, was instituted in a New York court against the Hartman Corporation and nine members of its board of directors, some of
whom were also officers. This suit was brought by the
taxpayer and eight others on behalf of themselves as
stockholders" and on behalf of the corporation and all
other stockholders who might join with them in the suit.
The defendants were charged with waste, extravagance,
mismanagement, neglect and fraudulent violation of their
duties as officers and directors, "to the great damage, loss
and prejdiice of the.Corporationiand its stockholders."
The plaintiffs sought (1) to compel 'the defendants to
account to the corporation for their official conduct, (2) to
compel the defendants to pay to the corporation's treasury
the amount of loss resulting from their alleged wrongful
acts, (3) to secure from the corporation suitable allowance
for counsel fees and other costs incurred in the suit and
(4) to secure such other relief as might be just, equitable
and proper.
8 The creditor's bill of complaint stated that Hartman Corporation

and its subsidiaries in 1931 sustained losses of $761,648 from closing
stores and lossesof $1,150,000 from necessary liquidation. It was
further alleged that the corporation sustained operating losses in 1930

in the amount of $1,830,000; in 1931, $2,076,266; from January, 1932,
to June 16, 1932, $400,000. After statlng that the company was be-

ing operated at a great financial loss and that it was unable to meet
and pay its obligations, the bill concluded by alleging that the assets
and properties were of great value and that if they were administered
through a receivership they would be sufficient to pay all of the
corporation's liabilities, leaving a surplus for the stockholders.
' These nine plaintiffs represented 4,407 of the approximately 60,000
Class A shares outstanding and 1151/2 of the more than 335,000
Class B shares outstanding.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

326 U. S.

The Hartman Corporation ceased operations under the
receivers on May 26, 1933, when a new company, Hartman's Inc., bought at a bankruptcy sale all of the assets
of Hartman Corporation's subsidiary company for
$501,000. The stock of the new company was issued to
the subsidiary's creditors. Stockholders of Hartman Corporation were also given the right to subscribe to the stock
and debentures of the new company, but the taxpayer did
not exercise that right.
The receivers filed their first report in the federal court
on August 10, 1934, in which it appeared that Hartman
Corporation had outstanding claims of $707,430.67 and
assets of only $39,593.13 in cash and the pending Graham
suit. It does not appear whether the suit was listed as
having any value. The identical situation was apparent
in the second report4 filed on July 11, 1935, except that
the cash assets had fallen to $27,192.51. A 4% dividend
to creditors was also approved at that time. On September 30, 1937, the final report was made. Outstanding
claims of $630,574.57 were then reported; the sole asset
was cash in the amount of $1,909.94, which was then distributed to creditors after deduction of receivership
costs.
In the meantime the Graham suit was slowly progressing. From 1933 to 1936, inclusive, extensive examinations
were made of certain defendants, the plaintiffs expending
some $2,800 in connection therewith exclusive of counsel
fees. But the case never reached trial. On February 27,
1937, a settlement was consummated whereby the defendants paid the taxpayer and her eight co-plaintiffs the sum
of $50,000 in full settlement and discharge of their claims
and the cause of action. The taxpayer's share of the settlement, after payment of expenses, amounted to $12,500.
The taxpayer had tried unsuccessfully in her 1934 income tax return to claim a deduction from gross income
in the amount of $32,302 as a loss due to the worthlessness

of her 1,100 shares of stock. The Commissioner denied
the deduction on the ground that the stock had not become
worthless during 1934; apparently no appeal was taken
from this determination. Then in 1937 the taxpayer
claimed a deduction from gross income in the amount of
$19,940, being the difference between the $32,440 purchase
price of the stock and the $12,500 received pursuant to
the settlement. The Commissioner again denied the deduction, this time on the ground that the stock had not
become worthless during 1937. The Tax Court sustained
his action and the court below affirmed as to this point.5
146 F. 2d 553. We granted certiorari because of an alleged
inconsistency with Smith v. Helvering,78 U. S. App. D. C.
342, 141 F. 2d 529, as to the proper test to be used
in determining the year in which a deductible loss is
sustained.
Section 23 (e) of the Revenue Act of 1936, like its identical counterparts in many preceding Revenue Acts, provides that in computing net income for income tax purposes there shall be allowed as deductions "losses sustained
during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise." Treasury regulations, in effect
prior to and at the time of the adoption of the 1936 Act
and repeated thereafter, have consistently interpreted
§ 23 (e) to mean that deductible losses "must be evidenced
by closed and completed transactions, fixed by identifiable
events, bona fide and actually sustained during the taxable period for which allowed." ' Such regulations, being
6The Commissioner also included in the taxpayer's 1937 gross
income the $12,500 received in the settlement and the Tax Court
sustained his action. But the court below reversed, holding that the
$12,500 must be regarded as a capital item in reduction of loss rather
than as income. This point is not now before us.

of 1936. Identical language is contained in Regulations 86, Art. 23

"long continued without substantial change, applying to
unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed
to have received congressional approval and have the effect
of law." Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, 83.
First. The taxpayer claims that a subjective rather than
an objective test is to be employed in determining whether
corporate stock became worthless during a particular year
within the meaning of § 23 (e). This subjective test is
said to depend upon the taxpayer's reasonable and honest
belief as to worthlessness, supported by the taxpayer's
overt acts and conduct in connection therewith.
But the plain language of the statute and of the Treasury interpretations having the force of law repels the use
of such a subjective factor as the controlling or sole
criterion. Section 23 (e) itself speaks of losses "sustained
during the taxable year." The regulations in turn refer
to losses "actually sustained during the taxable period,"
as fixed by "identifiable events." ' Such unmistakable
phraseology compels the conclusion that a loss, to be deductible under § 23 (e), must have been sustained in fact
during the taxable year. And a determination of whether
a loss was in fact sustained in a particular year cannot
fairly be made by confining the trier of facts to an examination of the taxpayer's beliefs and actions. Such an
issue of necessity requires a practical approach, all pertinent facts and circumstances being open to inspection
and consideration regardless of their objective or subjective nature. As this Court said in Lucas v. American
the Internal Revenue Code; and Regulations 111, § 29.23 (e)-l, under
the Internal Revenue Code.
I Treasury Regulations 94, Art. 23 (e)-4, further makes clear that
only losses in fact are deductible. Losses on stock due to shrinkage
of value are allowable only to the extent "actually suffered when the
stock is disposed of." And if, before being disposed of, the stock
becomes worthless, its cost or other .basis "is deductible by the owner
for the taxable year in which the stock became worthless, provided

a satisfactory showing is made of its worthlessness."

BOEHM v. COMMISSIONER.
287

293

Opinion of the Court.

Code Co., 280 U. S. 445, 449, "no definite legal test is
provided by the statute for the determination of the year
in which the loss is to be deducted. The general requirement that losses be deducted in the year in which they
are sustained calls for a practical, not a legal test"
The standard for determining the year for deduction of
a loss is thus a flexible, practical one, varying according
to the circumstances of each case. The taxpayer's attitude
and conduct are not to be ignored, but to codify them as
the decisive factor in every case is to surround the clear
language of § 23 (e) and the Treasury interpretations with
an atmosphere of unreality and to impose grave obstacles
to efficient tax administration.
Second. The taxpayer contends that even under the
practical, realistic test the stipulated facts demonstrate
as a matter of law that the stock of the Hartman Corporation did not become worthless until 1937, when the stockholders' suit was settled. Hence it is claimed that the
Tax Court erred in concluding that there was not a deductible loss in 1937 within the meaning of § 23 (e).
But the question of whether particular corporate stock
did or did not become worthless during a given taxable
year is purely a question of fact to be determined in the
first instance by the Tax Court, the basic fact-finding and
inference-making body. The circumstance that the facts
in a particular case may be stipulated or undisputed does
not make this issue any less factual in nature. The Tax
Court is entitled to draw whatever inferences and conclusions it deems reasonable from such facts. And an
appellate court is limited, under familiar doctrines, to a
consideration of whether the decision of the Tax Court
is "in accordance with law." 26 U. S. C. § 1141 (c) (1).
If it is in accordance, it is immaterial that different inferences and conclusions might fairly be drawn from the
undisputed facts. Commissioner v. Scottish American
Co., 323 U. S. 119.

OCTOBER TERM, 1945.
Opinion of the Court.

326 U. S.

Here it was the burden of the taxpayer to establish the
fact that there was a deductible loss in 1937. Burnet v.
Houston, 283 U. S. 223, 227. This burden was sought to
be carried by means of the stipulation of facts. But the
Tax Court, using the practical test previously discussed,
found the stipulated facts "insufficient to establish that
the stock had any value at the beginning of 1937 and became worthless during that year." It felt that such
evidence "clearly shows that the stock was worthless prior
to that year."
We are unable to say that the Tax Court's inferences
and conclusions on this factual matter are so unreasonable
from an evidentiary standpoint as to require a reversal of
its judgment. The stipulation shows a succession of
"identifiable events," occurring long before 1937, to justify
the conclusion that the stock was worthless prior to the
taxable year. The serious losses over a period of years,
the receivership, the receivers' reports, the excess of liabilities over assets, the termination of operations and the
bankruptcy sale of the assets of the principal subsidiary
all lend credence to the Tax Court's judgment.8 While the
stockholders' suit was prosecuted against defendants of
admitted "financial responsibility" and constituted an
asset of the corporation until settled in 1937, the Tax Court
felt that no substantial value to the suit had been shown.
There was no evidence in the stipulation of the merits of
the suit, the probability of recovery or any assurance of
collection of an amount sufficient to pay the creditors'
claims of more than $630,000 and to provide a sufficient
surplus for stockholders so as to give any real value to
their stock. The mere fact that the defendants were
financially responsible does not necessarily inject any
in general, 5 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation,
§§ 28.65 to 28.69; Lynch, "Losses Resulting From Stock Becoming
Worthless-Deductibility Under Federal Income Tax Laws," 8 Fordham L. Rev. 199.

recognizable value into the suit from the stockholders'
viewpoint. Hence it was reasonable to conclude that all
value had departed from the stock prior to 1937 and that
there was nothing left except a claim for damages against
third parties for destruction of that value.
The taxpayer points to the consequences of error and
other difficulties confronting one who in good faith tries
to choose the proper year in which to claim a deduction.
But these difficulties are inherent under the statute as now
framed. Any desired remedy for such a situation, of
course, lies with Congress rather than with the courts. It
is beyond the judicial power to distort facts or to disregard
legislative intent in order to provide equitable relief in a
particular situation.

STATE OF WASHINGTON.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 53. Argued October 16, 17, 1945.-Decided November 13, 1945.
Prior to the 1941 amendment of the Washington Industrial Insurance
Act, there was a 3-year limitation on the filing by a workman of a
claim for readjustment of compensation on account of aggravation

of injury. The 1941 amendment authorized the filing of such a
claim within five years from its effective date. There was no limitation, however, before or after the amendment, on the reopening of
a claim and the awarding of additional compensation by the Department on its own motion. A workman, against whom the 3-year
limitation of the preexisting law had run, filed pursuant to the 1941
amendment a claim for readjustment and was awarded additional
compensation.
Held that, upon the record in this case, the appellant employerhaving shown neither a probability that its future premium rate
