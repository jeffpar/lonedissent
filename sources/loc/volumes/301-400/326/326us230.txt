APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, COUNTY
OF KINGS.

No. 62. Argued October 18, 1945.-Decided November 5, 1945.
1. Chapter 93 of the Laws of New York of 1943, which extended for
a further period of one year moratory legislation first enacted in
1933, whereby as to mortgages executed prior to July 1, 1932 the
right of foreclosure for default in the payment of principal was
suspended, held not repugnant to the contract clause of the Federal
Constitution. Pp. 231, 234.
2. The incidence of mortgage moratorium legislation on an isolated
contract must be considered in the light of the right of the State

to safeguard the interests of its people. P. 232.
3. Home Bldg. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, and later cases,

followed; Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair,264 U. S. 543, differentiated.
Pp. 231, 235.
293 N. Y. 622, 59 N. E. 2d 625, affirmed.
APPEAL from the affirmance of a judgment (182 Misc.
863) which, in an action to foreclose a mortgage for nonpayment of principal, sustained the constitutionality of a
state statute suspending the right of foreclosure.

Mr. John P. McGrath for appellant.
Orrin G. Judd, Solicitor General of New York, for appellees.
Briefs were filed by Nathaniel L. Goldstein, Attorney

General of New York, Orrin G. Judd, Solicitor General,
and Saul A. Shames, Assistant Attorney General, on behalf
of the State of New York, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance; and by Mr. George R. Fearon on behalf of the
Savings Banks Association of the State of New York, as
amicu8 curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This was an action begun in 1944 to foreclose a mortgage on real property in the City of New York for non-

payment of principal that had become due in 1924. The
trial court held that the foreclosure proceeding was barred
by the applicable New York Moratorium Law. 182 Misc.
863,51 N. Y. S. 2d 496. This Law, Chapter 93 of the Laws
of New York of 1943, extended for another year legislation first enacted in 1933, whereby the right of foreclosure
for default in the payment of principal was suspended for
a year as to mortgages executed prior to July 1, 1932.1
Year by year (except in 1941 when an extension for two
years was made), the 1933 statute was renewed for another year. The New York Court of Appeals, one judge
dissenting, affirmed the trial court's judgment. 293 N. Y.
622, 59 N. E. 2d 625. Upon claim duly made below that
the Moratorium Law of 1943 was repugnant to the Contract Clause of the Constitution of the United States,
Art. I, ยง 10, the case is here on appeal under ยง 237 (a) of
the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. ยง 344 (a). The validity of
the statute is likewise challenget under the Fourteenth
Amendment but too feebly to merit consideration.
Since Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398,
there are left hardly any open spaces of controversy concerning the constitutional restrictions of the Contract
Clause upon moratory legislation referable to the depression. The comprehensive opinion of Mr. Chief Justice
Hughes in that case cut beneath the skin of words to the
core of meaning. After a full review of the whole course
of decisions expounding the Contract Clause--covering
almost the life of this Court--the Chief Justice, drawing
on the early insight of Mr. Justice Johnson 2 in Ogden v.
IThe 1943 Moratorium Law made the payment of interest, taxes,
insurance, and amortization charges a prerequisite to suspension of
foreclosure. These conditions concededly were met and the only
default here was in unpaid principal.

and limits of the Contract Clause, see Morgan, Mr. Justice William

Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286, as reinforced by later decisions cast in more modern terms, e. g., Manigault v.
Spring8, 199 U. S. 473,480; MarcusBrown Co. v. Feldman,
256 U. S. 170, 198, put the Clause in its proper perspective
in our constitutional framework. The Blaisdell case and
decisions rendered since (e. g., Honeyman v. Jacobs, 306
U. S. 539; Veix v. Sixth Ward Assn., 310 U. S. 32; GeIfert
v. National City Bank, 313 U. S. 221; FaitouteCo. v. Asbury Park, 316 U. S. 502), yield this governing constitutional principle: when a widely diffused public interest has
become enmeshed in a network of multitudinous private
arrangements, the authority of the State "to safeguard the
vital interests of its ptople," 290 U. S. at 434, is not to be
gainsaid by abstracting one such arrangement from its
public context and treating it as though it were an isolated
private contract constitutionally immune from impairment.
The formal mode of reasoning by means of which this
"protective power of the State," 290 U. S. at 440, is acknowledged is of little moment. It may be treated as an
implied condition of every contract and, as such, as much
part of the contract as though it were written into it,
whereby the State's exercise of its power enforces, and
does not impair, a contract. A more candid statement is
to recognize, as was said in Manigault v. Springs, supra,
that the power "which in its various ramifications is known
as the police power, is an exercise of the sovereign right
of the Government to protect the . . .general welfare of
the people, and is paramount to any rights under contracts

between individuals." 199 U. S. at 480. Once we are in
this domain of the reserve power of a State we must respect
the "wide discretion on the part of the legislature in determining what is and what is not necessary." Ibid. So
far as the constitutional issue is concerned, "the power of
the State when otherwise justified," Marcus Brown Co. v.
Feldman, 256 U. S.170, 198, is not diminished because a
private contract may be affected.
Applying these considerations to the immediate situation brings us to a quick conclusion. In 1933, New York
began a series of moratory enactments to counteract the
virulent effects of the depression upon New York realty
which have been spread too often upon the records of
this Court to require even a summary. Chapter 793 of
the Laws of 1933 gave a year's grace against foreclosures
of mortgages, but it obligated the mortgagor to pay taxes,
insurance, and interest. The validity of the statute was
sustained in Klinke v. Samuels, 264 N. Y. 144, 190 N. E.
324. The moratorium has been extended from year to
year. When the 1937 reenactment was questioned, the
New York Court of Appeals again upheld the legislation.
Maguire & Co. v. Lent & Lent, Inc., 277 N. Y. 694, 14
N. E. 2d 629. This decision was rendered after a joint
legislative committee had made a thorough study and
recommended continuance of the moratorium. New
York Legislative Document (1938) No. 58. In 1941, the
Legislature reflected some changes in economic conditions
by requiring amortization of the principal at the rate of
1% per annum, beginning with July 1, 1942. The same
legislature established another joint legislative committee
to review once more the New York mortgage situation.
"After a most exhaustive study of the moratorium," a
report was submitted recommending its extension for another year. New York Legislative Document (1942)
No. 45. The Governor of New York urged such legislation (New York Legislative Document (1943) No. 1,

p. 9) and the Law now under attack was enacted. It is
relevant to note that the New York Legislature in subsequent extensions of the moratorium again took note
of changed economic conditions by increasing the amortization rate to 2% in 1944 (L. 1944, c. 562) and to 3%
in 1945 (L. 1945, c. 378).
Appellant asks us to reject the judgment of the joint
legislative committee, of the Governor, and of the Legislature, that the public welfare, in the circumstances of
New York conditions, requires the suspension of mortgage
foreclosures for another year. On the basis of expert opinion, documentary evidence, and economic arguments of
which we are to take judicial notice, it urges such a change
in economic and financial affairs in New York as to deprive
of all justification the determination of New York's Legislature of what New York's welfare requires. We are invited to assess not only the range and incidence of what
are claimed to be determining economic conditions insofar
as they affect the mortgage market-bank deposits and
war savings bonds; increased payrolls and store sales;
available mortgage money and rise in real estate values-but also to resolve controversy as to the causes and continuity of such improvements, namely the effect of the
war and of its termination, and similar matters. Merely
to enumerate the elements that have to be considered
shows that the place for determining their weight and their
significance is the legislature not the judiciary. Unlike
Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56, 60, here there
was no "studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate protection." Here the Legislature was not even acting merely upon the pooled general
knowledge of its members. The whole course of the New
York moratorium legislation shows the empiric process of
legislation at its fairest: frequent reconsideration, intensive study of the consequences of what has been done,
readjustment to changing conditions, and safeguarding the

EAST NEW YORK BANK v. HAHN.

future on the basis of responsible forecasts. The New York
Legislature was advised by those having special responsibility to inform it that "the sudden termination of the
legislation which has dammed up normal liquidation of
these mortgages for more than eight years might well result in an emergency more acute than that which the original legislation was intended to alleviate." New York
Legislative Document (1942) No. 45, p. 25. It would indeed be strange if there were anything in the Constitution
of the United States which denied the State the power to
safeguard its people against such dangers. There is nothing. Justification for the 1943 enactment is not negatived because the factors that induced and constitutionally
supported its enactment were different from those which
induced and supported the moratorium statute of 1933.
It only remains to say that in ChAttleton Corp. v. Sin.
clair, 264 U. S. 543, which was strongly pressed on us, the
Court dealt with quite a different situation. The differentiating factors are too glaring to require exposition.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUsTICE RuTmiwz concurs in the result.
MR. JUsrTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
