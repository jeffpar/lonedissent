BAKER

ET AL.

V. TEXAS '& PACIFIC RAILWAY CO.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CIVIL APPEALS OF TEXAS,
FIFTH SUPREME JUDICIAL DISTRICT.

No. 363.

Argued March 25, 1959.--Decided April 6, 1959.

In this case arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the
question whether the decedent was killed while he was "employed"
by the railroad was an issue of fact which should have been
submitted to the jury. Pp. 227-229.
309 S. W. 2d 92, reversed.

Harvey L. Davis argued the cause and filed a brief for
petitioners.
D. L. Case argued the cause and filed a brief for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

This action was commenced by the petitioners against
the respondent railroad in a Texas State District Court,
under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65,
as amended, 45 U. S. C. §§ 51-60, to recover- damages
for the death of petitioners' decedent, Claude Baker,
allegedly caused by the negligence of the respondent.
Baker had been hired as a workman by W. H. Nichols
& Co., Inc., which was engaged in work along the main
line right of way of tlhe respondent under a contract
with it. The work consisted of "grouting," or pumping
sand and cement into the roadbed to strengthen and
stabilize it. Baker was struck and killed by a train while
engaged at this job. It was petitioners' contention in
the trial court that Baker was killed while he was
"employed" by respondent, within the meaning of § 1 of
the Act. Evidence on the question was introduced by
the parties, and a special issue for the jury's determination
was framed, but the judge declined to submit the issue to

the jury, holding as a matter of law that aker was not in
such a relationship to the railroad at the time of his death
as to entitle him to the protection of the Act. The Court
of Civil Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment for
the respondent, 309 S. W. 2d 92, and the Texas Supreme
Court refused an application for a writ of error. We
granted certiorari, 358 U. S. 878, to investigate whether
such an issue is properly one for determination by the
jury.
The Federal Employers' Liability Act does not use the
terms "employee" and "employed" in any special sense,
Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 237 U. S.. 84, 94,
so that the familiar general legal problems as to whose '
"employee" or "servant" a worker is at a given time presetit themselves as matters of federal law under the Act.
See Linstead v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 276 U. S. "28,
33-34. It has been well said of the question that "[e] ach
case must be decided on its peculiar facts and ordinarily
no one feature of the relationship is determinative."
*Cimorelli v. New York Central R. Co., 148 F. 2d 575, 577.
Although we find no decision of this Court that-has discussed the matter, we think it perfectl.y plain that the
question, like that of fault or of causation under the Act,
contains factual elements such as to make it one for the
jury under appropriate instructions as to the various relevant factors under law. See Restatement, Agency 2d,
§ 220, comment c; § 227, comment a. Only if reasonable
men could not reach differing conclusions on the issue may
the question be taken from the jury. See Chicago, R. I.
& P. R. Co. v. Bond, 240 U. S. 449. Here the petitioners
introduced evidence tending to prove that the grouting
work was part of the maintenance task: of -the railroad;
that the road furnished the material to be pumped into
the roadbed; and that a supervisor, admittedly in the
employ of the railroad, in the daily course of the work
exercised directive control over the details of the job per-

formed by the individual workmen, including the precise
point where the mixture should be pumped, when they
should move to the next point, and the consistency of the
mixture. The railroad introduced evidence tending to
controvert this and further evidence tending to show that
an employment relationship did not exist between it and
Baker at the time of the accident. An issue for determination by the jury was presented. "The very essence
of . . . [the jury's] function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers
most reasonable." Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union R.
Co., 321 U. S. 29, 35.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER would dismiss this writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524. As the Court
itself notes, "'[e]ach case must be decided on its peculiar
facts . . . .'" Such cases are unique and of no precedential value and are, therefore, outside of the criteria justifying a grant of certiorari. See Houston Oil Co. v.
Goodrich, 245 U. S. 440.
