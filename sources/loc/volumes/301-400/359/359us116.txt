until the patent issues, and then to dis-

miss the complaint as moot; (2) otherwise, on May 25,

from the merits of the controversy, the grant of the
extraordinary equitable relief of an injunction at that
stage of the proceedings would not be warranted. Upon
the fulfillment of either of these conditions, the proceedings heretofore had in the two lower courts are vacated.
