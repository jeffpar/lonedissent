UNITED STATES v. RANDS.
Opinion of the Court.

UNITED STATES v. RANDS ET UX.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 54.

Argued October 18, 1967.-Decided November 13, 1967.

Respondents owned land along the Columbia River in Oregon which
the United States condemned in connection with a lock and dam
project. In the condemnation action the trial court allowed compensation for sand, gravel, and agricultural purposes, but not for
the land's special value as a port site. The Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that exclusion of the port-site value of respondents' land contravened the Fifth Amendment as well as the policy
of the Submerged Lands Act. Held:
1. The interests of riparian owners are subject to the Government's power to control navigable waters and the proper exercise
of that power is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment.
United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U. S. 222 (1956),
followed. Pp. 122-127.
2. The Submerged Lands Act merely confirmed and vested in
the States title to lands beneath navigable waters within their
boundaries but expressly reserved to the United States its dominant navigational servitude. P. 127.
367 F. 2d 186, reversed and remanded.

Robert S. Rifkind argued the cause for the United
States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General
Marshall, Assistant Attorney General Weisl, Roger P.
Marquis and A. Donald Mileur.
Alex L. Parks argued the cause for respondents. With
him on the brief were Sidney Teiser and Robert B.
Abrams.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered

the opinion of the Court.

In this case the Court is asked to decide whether the

compensation which the United States is constitutionally
required to pay when it condemns riparian land includes
the land's value as a port site. Respondents owned land

along the Columbia River in the State of Oregon. They
leased the land to the State with an option to purchase,
it apparently being contemplated that the State would
use the land as an industrial park, part of which would
function as a port. The option was never exercised, for
the land was taken by the United States in connection
with the John Day Lock and Dam Project, authorized
by Congress as part of a comprehensive plan for the
development of the Columbia River. Pursuant to statute 1 the United States then conveyed the land to the
State of Oregon at a price considerably less than the
option price at which respondents had hoped to sell. In
the condemnation action, the trial judge determined that
the compensable value of the land taken was limited to
its value for sand, gravel, and agricultural purposes and
that its special value as a port site could not be considered. The ultimate award was about one-fifth the
claimed value of the land if used as a port. The Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, apparently
holding that the Government had taken from respondents a compensable right of access to navigable waters
and concluding that "port site value should be compensable under the Fifth Amendment." 367 F. 2d 186, 191
(1966). We granted certiorari, 386 U. S. 989, because
of a seeming conflict between the decision below and
United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U. S. 222
(1956). We reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals because the principles underlying Twin City
govern this case and the Court of Appeals erred in failing
to follow them.
The Commerce Clause confers a unique position upon
the Government in connection with navigable waters.
"The power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all
174 Stat. 486, 33 U. S. C. ยง 578.

the navigable waters of the United States . . . . For
this purpose they are the public property of the nation,
and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress."
Gilman v. Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713, 724-725 (1866).
This power to regulate navigation confers upon the
United States a "dominant servitude," FPC v. Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp., 347 U. S. 239, 249 (1954), which
extends to the entire stream and the stream bed below
ordinary high-water mark. The proper exercise of this
power is not an invasion of any private property rights
in the stream or the lands underlying it, for the damage
sustained does not result from taking property from
riparian owners within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which
the interests of riparian owners have always been subject. United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co.,
312 U. S. 592, 596-597 (1941); Gibson v. United States,
166 U. S. 269, 275-276 (1897). Thus, without being
constitutionally obligated to pay compensation, the
United States may change the course of a navigable
stream, South Carolina v. Georgia, 93 U. S. 4 (1876),
or otherwise impair or destroy a riparian owner's access
to navigable waters, Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S.
269 (1897); Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141 (1900);
United States v. Commodore Park, Inc., 324 U. S. 386
(1945), even though the market value of the riparian
owner's land is substantially diminished.
The navigational servitude of the United States does
not extend beyond the high-water mark. Consequently,
when fast lands are taken by the Government, just compensation must be paid. But "just as the navigational
privilege permits the Government to reduce the value of
riparian lands by denying the riparian owner access to
the stream without compensation for his loss,... it also
permits the Government to disregard the value arising
from this same fact of riparian location in compensating

the owner when fast lands are appropriated." United
States v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 365 U. S. 624, 629
(1961). Specifically, the Court has held that the Government is not required to give compensation for "water
power" when it takes the riparian lands of a private
power company using the stream to generate power.
United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co., 229
U. S. 53, 73-74 (1913). Nor must it compensate the
company for the value of its uplands as a power plant
site. Id., at 76. Such value does not "inhere in these
parcels as upland," but depends on use of the water to
which the company has no right as against the United
States: "The Government had dominion over the water
power of the rapids and falls and cannot be required to
pay any hypothetical additional value to a riparian
owner who had no right to appropriate the current to his
own commercial use." Ibid.
All this was made unmistakably clear in United States
v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U. S. 222 (1956). The
United States condemned a promising site for a hydroelectric power plant and was held to be under no obligation to pay for any special value which the fast lands
had for power generating purposes. The value of the
land attributable to its location on the stream was "due
to the flow of the stream; and if the United States were
required to pay the judgments below, it would be compensating the landowner for the increment of value added
to the fast lands if the flow of the stream were taken into
account." 350 U. S., at 226.
We are asked to distinguish between the value of land
as a power site and its value as a port site. In the power
cases, the stream is used as a source of power to generate
electricity. In this case, for the property to have value
as a port, vessels must be able to arrive and depart by
water, meanwhile using the waterside facilities of the
port. In both cases, special value arises from access to,

UNITED STATES v. RANDS.

and use of, navigable waters. With regard to the constitutional duty to compensate a riparian owner, no distinction can be drawn. It is irrelevant that the licensing
authority presently being exercised over hydroelectric
projects may be different from, or even more stringent
than, the licensing of port sites. We are dealing with
the constitutional power of Congress completely to regulate navigable streams to the total exclusion of private
power companies or port owners. As was true in Twin
City, if the owner of the fast lands can demand port site
value as part of his compensation, "he gets the value of
a right that the Government in the exercise of its dominant servitude can grant or withhold as it chooses....
To require the United States to pay for this . . . value
would be to create private claims in the public domain."
350 U. S., at 228.
Respondents and the Court of Appeals alike have found
Twin City inconsistent with the holding in United States
v. River Rouge Improvement Co., 269 U. S. 411 (1926).
In that case, the Government took waterfront property
to widen and improve the navigable channel of the Rouge
River. By reason of the improvements, other portions
of the riparian owner's property became more valuable
because they were afforded direct access to the stream
for the building of docks and other purposes related to
navigation. Pursuant to ยง 6 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act of 1918,2 the compensation award for the part of
the property taken by the Government was reduced
by the value of the special and direct benefits to the
remainder of the land. The argument here seems to
be that if the enhancement in value flowing from a
riparian location is real enough to reduce the award for
another part of the same owner's property, consistency
demands that these same values be recognized in the
award when any riparian property is taken by the Gov240

ernment. There is no inconsistency. Twin City and its
predecessors do not deny that access to navigable waters
may enhance the market value of riparian property.
See United States v. Commodore Park, Inc., 324 U. S., at
388, 390. And, in River Rouge, it was recognized that
state law may give the riparian owner valuable rights of
access to navigable waters good against other riparian
owners or against the State itself. 269 U. S., at 418-419.
But under Twin City and like cases, these rights and values are not assertable against the superior rights of the
United States, are not property within the meaning of
the Fifth Amendment, and need not be paid for when
appropriated by the United States. Thus, when only
part of the property is taken and the market value of
the remainder is enhanced by reason of the improvement
to navigable waters, reducing the award by the amount
of the increase in value simply applies in another context the principle that special values arising from access
to a navigable stream are allocable to the public, and not
to private interest. Otherwise the private owner would
receive a windfall to which he is not entitled.
Our attention is also directed to Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312 (1893), where
it was held that the Government had to pay the goingconcern value of a toll lock and dam built at the implied
invitation of the Government, and to the portion of the
opinion in Chandler-Dunbarapproving an award requiring the Government to pay for the value of fast lands
as a site for a canal and lock to bypass the falls and
rapids of the river. Monongahela is not in point, however, for the Court has since read it as resting "primarily
upon the doctrine of estoppel. . . ." Omnia Commercial
Co., Inc. v. United States, 261 U. S. 502, 513-514 (1923).
The portion of Chandler-Dunbarrelied on by respondents
was duly noted and dealt with in Twin City itself, 350
U. S. 222, 226, n. (1956). That aspect of the decision

UNITED STATES v. RANDS.

Opinion of the Court.

has been confined to its special facts, and, in any event, if
it is at all inconsistent with Twin City, it is only
the latter which survives.
Finally, respondents urge that the Government's position subverts the policy of the Submerged Lands Act,'
which confirmed and vested in the States title to the
lands beneath navigable waters within their boundaries
and to natural resources within such lands and waters,
together with the right and power to manage, develop,
and use such lands and natural resources. However,
reliance on that Act is misplaced, for it expressly recognized that the United States retained "all its navigational servitude and rights in and powers of regulation
and control of said lands and navigable waters for the
constitutional purposes of commerce, navigation, national defense, and international affairs, all of which shall
be paramount to, but shall not be deemed to include,
proprietary rights of ownership . .

. ."

'

Nothing in the

Act was to be construed "as the release or relinquishment of any rights of the United States arising under the
constitutional authority of Congress to regulate or improve navigation, or to provide for flood control, or the
production of power." 5 The Act left congressional
power over commerce and the dominant navigational
servitude of the United States precisely where it found
them.
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is reversed and the case remanded with direction to reinstate the judgment. of the District Court.
Reversed and remanded.
