OCTOBER TERM, 1967.
Per Curiam.

389 U. S.

JONES v. GEORGIA.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF GEORGIA.

No. 174, Misc.

Decided October 16, 1967.

Petitioner appealed his murder conviction on the ground, among
others, that the evidence of systematic exclusion of Negroes from
grand and petit juries established a prima facie case of discrimination under Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545. The Georgia
Supreme Court affirmed because "public officers are presumed
to have discharged their sworn official duties," and "we can not
assume that the jury commissioners did not eliminate prospective
jurors on the basis of their competency to serve, rather than
because of racial discrimination." Held: The State's burden to
explain the "disparity between the percentage of Negroes on the
tax digest and those on the venires" was not met by reliance on
the stated presumptions.
Certiorari granted; 223 Ga. 157, 154 S. E. 2d 228, reversed and
remanded.

Wilbur D. Owens, Jr., for petitioner.

Arthur K. Bolton, Attorney General of Georgia,
G. Ernest Tidwell, Executive Assistant Attorney General,
and Marion 0. Gordon, Assistant Attorney General, for
respondent.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
Petitioner appealed his conviction for murder to the
Georgia Supreme Court where he sought reversal on the
ground, among others, that the evidence relevant to his
claim of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand
and petit juries drawn in the county established a prima
facie case of the denial of equal protection within our

decision in Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545.* The
Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction stating
that Whitus was distinguishable because "public officers
are presumed to have discharged their sworn official
duties. .

.

. Under the testimony in this case we can

not assume that the jury commissioners did not eliminate prospective jurors on the basis of their competency
to serve, rather than because of racial discrimination."
223 Ga. 157, 162, 154 S. E. 2d 228, 232.
We hold that the burden upon the State to explain
"the disparity between the percentage of Negroes on
the tax digest and those on the venires," Whitus, supra,
at 552, was not met by the Georgia Supreme Court's
reliance on the stated presumptions. See Arnold v.
North Carolina,376 U. S. 773; Eubanks v. Louisiana,356
U. S. 584; Williams v. Georgia, 349 U. S. 375; Avery v.
Georgia, 345 U. S. 559; Cassell v. Texas, 339 U. S. 282;
Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587. We therefore reverse
the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court and remand
for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.
It is so ordered.
