PER CURIAM.

The petition for certiorari is granted.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York in order to give that
court an opportunity to consider the motion to substitute
the Konkursamt Basel-Stadt (the Bankruptcy Office of
Basel, Switzerland) as party petitioner, and to reconsider
that court's former adjudication of contempt and the
accompanying fine in light of the original petitioner's
death.
It is so ordered.
