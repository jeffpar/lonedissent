THE

COURT

OF

APPEALS

OF

NEW

YORK.

Argued January 16, 1969.-Decided March 24, 1969.

Evidence obtained by wiretapping conducted in 1964 pursuant to
a warrant issued under N. Y. Code Crim. Proc. § 813-a (held
violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments for overbreadth in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, only to the limited
extent that it permitted a "trespassory intrusion into a constitutionally protected area") held admissible in state criminal trial,
since the wiretapping occurred before (1) Katz v. United States,
389 U. S. 347, overruled prior decisions that the Fourth Amendment encompassed seizures of speech only if there was a trespass
or a physical invasion of the speaker's constitutionally protected
area, and (2) Lee v. Florida, 392 U. S. 378, extended the rule
excluding evidence violative of § 605 of the Federal Communications Act to state trials; and both Katz v. United States and
Lee v. Florida have been held to apply prospectively only (Desist
v. United States, ante, p. 244, and Fuller v. Alaska, 393 U. S. 80,
respectively). Pp. 281-283.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The petitioner was convicted in a New York trial court
in 1966 on three counts of conspiracy to extort, attempted
extortion, and coercion. The case for the prosecution
rested principally on the content of two telephone conversations between the petitioner and one of his coconspirators. Tapes and transcripts of those conversations were introduced at the trial over the petitioner's
objection that they had been obtained by an unlawful

wiretap. The conviction was affirmed by the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of New York ' and by
the New York Court of Appeals.' We granted certiorari. 3
The telephone calls in question were made in 1964 by
the petitioner from outside New York City to a coconspirator at a bar in Manhattan. The conversations
were recorded by means of a device attached to wires
of the central terminal box in the basement of the
building in which the bar was located. This wiretapping
was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued under N. Y.
Code Crim. Proc. § 813-a, the statute with which this
Court subsequently dealt in Berger v. New York, 388
U. S. 41, in reversing a conviction under the Fourth and
Fourteenth Amendments.
The petitioner contends that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments as construed in Berger, as well as
§ 605 of the Federal Communications Act,4 prohibited
the introduction of the intercepted conversations and
therefore require reversal of his conviction. For the
reasons stated below, we reject these contentions and
affirm the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.'

4 Section 605, 48 Stat. 1103, 47 U. S. C. § 605, reads in pertinent
part as follows:
"[N]o person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any
communication and divulge . . . the existence, contents, substance,
purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any
person . ..."
5The petitioner also contends that the prosecutor's references to
the recorded conversations as "confessions" were so inaccurate and
misleading as to deny him due process. We do not believe that that
characterization of the evidence raises any substantial federal question. The jury was aware that the prosecutor was adverting to the
overheard conversations and knew the circumstances under which
the incriminating statements had been made. In contrast to the

394 U. S.

Not until last Term in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.
347, did this Court overrule its prior decisions that the
Fourth Amendment encompassed seizures of speech only
if the law enforcement officers committed a trespass or at
least physically invaded a constitutionally protected area
of the speaker." Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S.
438, explicitly held that wiretapping conducted without
such an intrusion was not an unlawful search or seizure.
That rule was not modified by Berger v. New York. The
Court's discussion of Olmstead in Berger, while recognizing that other cases had negated the statements in
Olmstead that conversations are never protected by the
Fourth Amendment, cast no doubt upon "[t]he basis of
the [Olmstead] decision"-"that the Constitution did
not forbid the obtaining of evidence by wiretapping
unless it involved actual unlawful entry into the house."'
Furthermore, the Court in Berger found the overbreadth
of N. Y. Code Crim. Proc. § 813-a repugnant to the
Fourth Amendment only to the limited extent that it
permitted a "trespassory intrusion into a constitutionally
protected area." "
Olmstead, then, stated the controlling interpretation
of the Fourth Amendment with respect to wiretapping
until it was overruled by Katz. And in Desist v. United
States, ante, p. 244, we have held today that Katz is to
be applied wholly prospectively. Since the wiretapping
in this case occurred before Katz was decided and was
accomplished without any intrusion into a constitutionally protected area of the petitioner, its fruits were not
inadmissible under the exclusionary rule of the Fourth
situation in Miller v. Pate, 386 U. S. 1, there was here no misrepresentation about evidence which the jurors were not themselves in a
position to evaluate.

and Fourteenth Amendments. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.

Nor did § 605 of the Federal Communications Act
require exclusion of the intercepted conversations. Until
our decision last Term in Lee v. Florida, 392 U. S. 378,
state trial courts were free to accept evidence violative
of § 605.' Lee extended the Nardone 10 exclusionary rule
of § 605 to the States, but that decision has also been
held to apply only prospectively. Fuller v. Alaska, 393

the petitioner's trial in 1966, long before the date of our

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.

It is conceded that petitioner's conviction rested largely
upon evidence acquired by nontrespassory wiretapping
conducted pursuant to a warrant issued under N. Y. Code
Crim. Proc. § 813-a. The Court affirms the conviction
on the ground that today's decision in Desist v. United
States, ante, p. 244, necessarily dictates that evidence

seized in violation of § 605 by federal officers was not admissible in

excluded from federal trials.

obtained by an illegal, nontrespassory wiretap will be
inadmissible only if the tapping occurred after the date
of the decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347
(1967). The wiretapping in this case took place prior
to Katz. However, the case is here on direct review,
and for the reasons stated in Part I of my dissenting
opinion in Desist, supra, at 258-259, I would hold that
petitioner is entitled to benefit from the Katz rule.
It is therefore necessary for me to consider whether
petitioner's federal constitutional rights were violated by
the wiretapping. Were I free to do so, I would decide
this issue by inquiring whether, on the facts of this
particular case and in light of New York decisions construing § 813-a, the wiretapping was valid under the
Warrants Clause of the Fourth Amendment. See Ker
v. California,374 U. S. 23, 30-34 (1963); see also Mapp
v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961). However, I believe that
this approach is foreclosed by this Court's decision in
Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41 (1967). In Berger,
the Court held that a "bugging" pursuant to a § 813-a
warrant violated the petitioner's Fourth Amendment
rights because on its face the statute did not contain
constitutionally required safeguards. It is true that the
"bugging" in Berger involved a trespass and that the
Court did not reach the question whether Olmstead
should be overruled. But the holding that § 813-a was
to be considered on its face rather than as applied
depended in no way upon the fact of physical intrusion.
The warrant procedure prescribed in § 813-a applies
equally to "bugging" and to wiretapping. Hence, the
Court's "on its face" approach would seem necessarily
to embrace § 813-a wiretapping.
I dissented from the "on its face" approach adopted in
Berger. See 388 U. S., at 89 et seq. I continue to
disagree with that approach. Yet I think that Berger
must be taken as having decided that a warrant issued

KAISER v. NEW YORK.
HARLAN,

J., dissenting.

pursuant to the version of § 813-a then in effect could
not possibly satisfy the requirements of the Fourth
Amendment.* Since I regard myself as bound by Berger,
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude that the wiretap
evidence introduced against petitioner was seized in violation of the Constitution, and that his conviction
consequently cannot stand.

*There were no amendments to § 813-a between June 1962, the
date of the "bugging" in Berger, and July 1964, the date of the
wiretapping in this case. Nor in my view is it necessary to decide
whether Berger should be "retroactive." The present case was on
direct appeal in the New York courts at the time Berger was
decided, and petitioner is therefore entitled to invoke Berger under
the rule advanced in Part I of my dissenting opinion in Desist.
