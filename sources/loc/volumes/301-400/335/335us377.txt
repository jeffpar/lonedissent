CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 22. Argued October 15, 1948.-Decided December 6, 1948.
If otherwise applicable, the Fair Labor Standards Act covers employees of American contractors engaged in the construction of a
military base for the United States in an area in Bermuda leased
by Great Britain to the United States for 99 years-even though
the leased area is Under the sovereignty of Great Britain and is
not territory of the United States in a political sense. Pp. 378-390.
1. The question whether the Act applies in this area is not a political question beyond the competence of courts to decide. P. 380.
2. Under the power granted by the Constitution, Art. IV, § 3,
cl. 2, to make "all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the
Territory or other Property belonging to the United States,"
Congress has power to regulate labor contracts where the incidents
regulated occur in areas under the control, though not within the
territorial jurisdiction or sovereignty, of the United States. P. 381.
3. Under the terms of the particular lease under which this area
was leased by Great Britain to the United States, the United States
is authorized by the lessor to provide for maximum hours -and
minimum wages for employers and employees within the area.
Pp. 382-383.
4. Neither the lack of specific reference to leased areas in the
legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act nor the fact
that this particular Bermuda base was acquired after the passage
of the 'Act prevents the Act from covering such areas. Pp. 383385.
5. In the circumstaces of this case and in the light of the
broad purpose of the Act, of the fact that the Act applies to faroff islands whose economy differs markedly from our own, and of
the fact.that Congress has extended the coverage of other acts
to such bases, the word "possession," used by Congress to define
the geographical coverage of this Act, is construed as making
the Act applicable to employer-employee relationships in the area
of foreign territory on Bermuda under lease for a military base.
Pp. 386-390.
164 F. 2d 924, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

:335 U. S.

Certain employees of American contractoi 3 engaged in
the construction of a military base ior the United States
in an area on Bermuda leased by Great Britain to the
United States sued for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S. C. §, 201 et seq.
On defendants' motion for a summary judgment, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that
the applicability of the Act depended upon a political
question outside of judicial power. 73F. Supp. 860. The
Court of Appeals reversed. 164 F. 2d 924. This Court
granted certiorari. 333 U. S. 859. Affirmed, p. 390.
Charles Fahy argued the cause for petitioners. With
him cin the brief were Joseph Markle, Franklin Nevius,
J. Randall Creel and Philip Levy..
Sol L. Firstenberg argued the cause for respondents.
With him on the brief was Jacob Bromberg.
Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General
Morison, Robert L. Stern, Paul A. Sweeney and Melvin
Richter filed a brief for. the United States, as amicus
curiae, urging reversal.
MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case brings before us for review the applicability
of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060,
to employees allegedly engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce on a leasehold of the
United States, located on the Crown Colony of Bermuda.
Th-e leasehold, a military base, was obtained by the
United States through a lease executed by the British
Government. This lease was the result of negotiations
adequately summarized for consideration by the letters
of the Marquess of Lothian, the British Ambassador to
the United States, of .date September 2, 1940; the reply

of Mr. Cordell Hull, then our -Secretary of State, of the
same date; and the Agreement of March 27, 1941, between the two nations to further effectuate the declara1
tions of the Ambassador in his letter.
The Fair Labor Standards Act covers commerce
"among the several States or from any State to any place
outside thereof." State means "any State of the United
States or the District of Columbia or any Territory or
possession of the United States." § 3 (b) and (c) of the
Act.
Certain employees of contractors who had contracts for
work for the United States on the Bermuda base brought
this suit under § 16. (b) of the Act for recovery of unpaid
overtime compensation and damages, claimed to be due
them for the employer's violation of § 7, requiring overtime compensation. We do not enter into any consideration of the. employees' right to .recover if the Fair Labor
Standards Act is applicable to employment on the Bermuda base, for the complaint was dismissed on defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that
the applicability depended upon the "sovereign jurisdiction of the United States," that the executive and legis- "
lative branches of the Government had indicated that
such leased areas were not under our sovereign jurisdiction and that this was. a political question outside of
judicial power. Cannell v. Vermilya-Brown Co., 73 F.
Supp. 860. The United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, holding that the Act applied Jo the Bermuda base, reversed this judgmelnt and remanded the
case to the District Court for further proceedings on the
merits. 164 F. 2d 924. Our affirmance of this judgment
approves that disposition of the appeal.

Opinion of the Court.

335 U. S.

On account of the obvious importance of the case from
the standpoint of administration, in view of the number
of leased areas occupied by the United States, we granted
certiorari. 333 U. S. 859.
(1) We shall consider first our power to explore the
problem as to whether the Fair Labor Standards Act
covers this leased area. Or, to phrase it differently, is
this a political question beyond the competence of courts
to decide? Cf. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S; 433, 450;
Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, 552. There is nothing
that indicates to us that this Court should refuse to decide
a controversy between litigants because the geographical
coverage of this statute is involved. Recognizing that
the determination of sovereignty aver an area is for the
legislative and executive departments, Jones v. United
States, 137 U. S. 202, does not debar courts from examining the status resulting from prior action. De Lima v.
Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1; Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324
U. S. 652. We have no occasion for this opinion to differ
from the view as to sovereignty expressed "for the Secretary of State" by The Legal.Adviser of the Department
in his letter of January 30, 1948, to the Attorney General
in relation to further legal steps in the present controversy after the judgment of the Court of Appeals. It
was there stated:
"The arrangements under which the leased bases
were acquired from Great Britain did not and were
not intended to transfer sovereignty over the leased
areas from Great Britain to the United States."
Nothing in this opinion is intended to intimate that we
have any different view from that expressed for the
Secretary of State. In the light of the statement of the
Department of State, we predicate our views on the issue
presented upon the postulate that the leased area is under
the sovereignty of Great Britain and that it is not territory

Opinion of the Court.

of the United States in a political sense, that is, a part
of its national domain.
(2) We have no doubt that Congress has power, in
certain situations, to regulate the actions of our citizens
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Unitbd States
whether or not the act punished occurred within the territory of a foreign nation. This was established as to:
crimes directly affecting the Government in United States
v. Bowman, 260 U. S. 94. This Court there pointed out,
p. 102, that clearly such legislation concerning our citizens
could not offend the dignity or right of sovereignty of
another nation. See Blackmer v. United States, 284 U. S.
421, 437; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69, 73, 78.
A fortiori civil controls may apply, we think, to liabilities
created by statutory regulation of labor contracts, even if
aliens may be involved, where the- incidents regulated
occur on areas under the control, though. not within the
territorial jurisdiction or sovereignty, of the nation enacting the legislation.' This is implicitly conceded by all
parties. This power is placed Specifically in Congress by
virtue of the authorization for "needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States." Constitution, Art. IV, § 3,
cl. 2.' It does not depend upon sovereignty in the political or any sense over the territory. So the Administrator
.of the Wage-Hour Division has issued a statenent of
general policy or interpretation that directs all officerq
and agencies of his division to apply this Act to the Canal
Zone, admittedly territory over which we do not have
sovereignty. 29 C. F. R., 1947 Supp.. pp. 4392-93.
2 No due process question arises from this extension of legisla.tion
over. such controlled areas such as was considered to bar state action
concerning contracts made and to he l)erformed beyond the boundaries of a state. Cf. Home Ins. Co. v. Dick, 281 U. S. 397, 407, with
Alaska Packers Assn. v. Conmm'n, 294 U. S. 532, 541.
Cf. Ashwapder v. T. V. A., 297 U. S. 288, 330, et seq.

(3) lin this view of the relationship of our government
to a leased area, the terms of this particular lease become
important. Reference, note 1, supra, has been made to
the United States Statutes where the title documents are
readily available. It is unnecessary to print them here
in full. In the margin are extracts that indicate their
meaning as to the~control intended to be granted.' Under
455

Stat. 1560:

Article I, "(1) The United States shall have all the rights, power
and authority within the Leased Areas which are necessary for the
establishment, use, operation and defence thereof, or appropriate
for their control,

. .

Article XI, "(4) It is understood that a Leased Area is not a part
of the territory of the United States for the purpose of coastwise
shipping laws so as to exclude British vessels from trade between the
United States and the Leased Areas." P. 1565.
Article XIII, "(1) The immigration laws of the Territory shall
not operate or apply so as to prevent admission into the Territory,
for the purposes of this Agreement, of any member of the United
States Forces posted to a Leased Area or any person (not being a
national of'a Power at war with His Majesty; the King) employed
by, or under a contract with, the Governmenti of the United States
in connection with the construction, maintenance, operation or defence of the Bases in the trerritory; but suitable arrangements will
be made by the United States to enable such persons to be readily
identified and their status to be established." P. 1565.
Article XIV, "(1) No import, excise, consumption or other tax,
duty or impost shall be charged on"(c) goods consigned to the United States Authorities for the use of
institutions under Government control known as Post Exchanges,
Ships' Service Stores, Commissary Stores or Service Clubs, or for
sale thereat to members of the United States forces, or civilian employees of the United States being nationals of the United States and
employed in connection with the Bases, or members of their families
resident with them and not engaged in any business or occupation in
the Territory;" P. 1566.
Article XXIX, "During the continuance of any Lease, no laws of
the Territory which would derogate from or prejudice any of the

Opinion of the Court.

this agreement we have no doubt that the United States
is authorized by the lessor to provide for maximum hours
and minimum wages for employers and employees within

the area, and the question of whether the Fair Labor
Standards Act applies is one of statutory construction,
not legislative power.
(4) At the time of the. enactment of the Act, June

25, 1938, the United States had no leased base in Bermuda. This country did have a lease from the Republic
of Cuba of an area at Guantanamo Bay for a coaling
or naval station "for the time required for the purposes

of coaling and naval stations."

The United States was

granted by the Cuban lease substantially the same rights
as it has in the Bermuda lease.'
The time limits of the
grant were redefined on June 9, 1934, as extending until
agreement for abrogation or unilateral abandonment by
rights conferred on the United States by the Lease or by this Agreement shall be applicalbe within the Leased Area, save with the concurrence of the UnitedStates." P. 1570.
There are also articles arranging for postal facilities and tax exemptions.

regard to the Panama Canal Zone.' Further, in the
Philippine Independence Acts of January 17, 1933, and
March 24, 1934, provisions existed looking toward the
retention of military and other bases in the Philippine
Islands. 47 Stat. 761, §§ 5 and 10; 48 Stat. 456, §§ 5
and 10.! A Convention between the governments of Nicaragua and the United States of America, proclaimed June
24, 1916, 39 Stat. 1661, gave the United States for 99
years "sovereign authority" over certain islands in the
Isthmlian Canal Convention, 33 Stat. 2234:
"The United States of America and the Republic of Panama being
desirous to insure the construction of a ship canal across the Isthmus
of Panama to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and the Congress of the United States of America having passed an act approved
June 28, 1902, in furtherance of that object, by which the President
of the United States is authorized to acquire within a reasonable
time the control of the necessary territory of the Republic of Colombia, and the sovereignty of such territory being actually vested in the
Republic of Panama, 'the -high contracting parties have resolved for
that purpose to conclude a convention and have accordingly appointed.
as their plenipotentiaries, -"
Id, 2235:
"Article III.
"The Republic of Panama grants to the United States all the
rights, power and authority within the zone mentioned and described
in Article II of this agreement and within the limits of all auxiliary
lands and waters mentioned and described in said Article II which
the United States would possess and exercise if it were the sovereign
of the territory within which said lands and waters are located to
the entire exclusion of the exercise by the Republic of Panama of
any such sovereign rights, power or authority."
.7 Through the Joint Resolution of June 29, 1944,58 Stat. 625, these
provisions were effectuated in leases for 99 years by an agreement
of March 14, 1947. 61 Stat. 2834, Treaties and International Acts

Caribbean Sea.' None of these international arrangements were discussed in reports or the debates concerniy~g
the scope 'of the Fair Labor Standards Act. After :the
passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act and during
•World War II, a number of bases for military operations
were leased by the United States not only on territory
. of the British Commonwealth of Natibrns but on that
of other sovereignties also. ' The provisions ofrthese leases
paralleled 'in many respects the. Bermuda lease.'
Neither this lack of specific reference in the legislative
history to leased areas, however, nor the fact that the particular Bermuda base was acquired after the pssage of
the Act seems to us decisive of its coverage. "The reach
of the act is not sustained or opposed by the- fact that it
is sought to bring new situations under its terms."
The
Sherman Act of 1890, a date when we had no insular.
possessions, was held by its use of the word "Territory
in its § 3 to be applicable in Puerto Rico,• a depend-'
ency acquired by the Treaty of Paris in 1898.11 The.
.answer as to the scope of the Wage-Hour Act lies in th.
purpose of Congress in defining its reach,.
The power of control over leased areas obtained by the United

States through the above leases is not greater than that ordinarily
exercised by sovereign lessees of foreign territory. See 34 American
Journal of International Law 703; Lawrence, Principles of International Law (6th ed., 1915) 175; H. R. Doe. No. 1, 56th Cong., 2d

(5) The point of statutory construction for our determination is as to whether the' word "possession," used
by Congress to bound the geographical coverage of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, fixes the limits of the Act's
scope so as to include the Bermuda base. The word
"possession" is not a word of art, descriptive of a recognized geographical or governmental entity. What was
said of "territories" in the Shell Co. case, 302 U. S. 253,
at 258, is applicable:
"Words generally have different shades of meaning,
and are to be construed if reasonably' possible to
effectuate the intent of the lawmakers; and this
meaning in particular instances is to be arrived at
not only by a consideration of the words themselves,
but by considering, as well, the context, the purposes
of the law, and the circumstances under which the
words were employed."
The word "possession" has been employed in a number
of statutes both before and since the Fair Labor Standards
Act to describe the areas to which various congressional
statutes apply." We do not find that these examples
sufficiently outline the meaning 'of the word to furnish

The War Damage Corporation Act and the Defense Base Act, 56

.were specifically considered by Congress. Hearings on H. R. 6382,
House of Representatives, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 27; 88 Cong. Rec.

Fair Labor Standards Act, where such problems were not specifically
considered.

such definite indication of the purpose to include or exclude leased'areas, such as the Bermuda base, in the word
"possepsion" appears. We cannot even say, "We see
what you are driving at, but, you have not said it, and
therefore we shall go on as before." 14. Under such circumstances, our duty as a Court is to construe the word
"possession" as our judgment instructs us the lawmakers,
within constitutional limits, would have done had they
acted at the time of the legislation with the present
situation in mind.
The word "possession" in the Act includes far-off islands
whose economy differs markedly from our own. Thus
the employees of Puerto Rico, Guam, the guano islands,
Samoa and the Virgin Islands have the protection, of the
Act. See 29 C. F. R., 1947 Supp., 4393. Since drastic
change in local economy was not a deterrent in these instances, :there is no reason for saying that the wage-hour
provisions of the Act were not intended to bring these
minimum changes into the labor market of the bases.15
Since its passage of the Act, Congress has extended the
coverage of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act to,the bases acquired since January 1,
terstate commerce should, not be made the instrument of competition
in the distribution of goods produced under substandard labor con-

ditio s which competition is injurious to the commerce and t6 the
states frbm and'to which the commerce flows."
Substandard conditions included excessive hours'of labor. Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, 316 U. S. 572,577.
14Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32.
15 When Congress dealt with coverage in the National Labor Relations Act, enacted Jly 5, 1935, 49 Stat. 449, 450, it used a narrower

definition of commerce, one restricted to States and Territories.
That las been held to cover Puerto Rico but we are not advised
of 'any application to the bases. Cf. Labor Board v. Gonzalez Padin
Co., 161 F. 2d 353.

1940, and to Guantanamo Bay.'" When one reads the
comprehensive definition of the reach of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, it is difficult to formulate a boundary to its
coverage short of areas over which the power of Congress
extends, by our sovereignty or by voluntary grant of
the authority by the sovereign lessor to legislate upon
maximum hours and minimum wages. Under the terms
of the lease, we feel sure that the House of Assembly of
Bermuda would not also undertake legislation similar to
our Fair Labor Standards Act to control labor relations
on the base. Since citizens of this country would be
numerous among employees on the bases, the natural
legislative impulse would be to give these employees the
same protection that was given those similarly employed
on the islands of the Pacific.
Under subdivisions 2 and 3, supra, we have pointed out
that the power rests in Congress under our Constitution
and the provisions of the lease to regulate labor relations
on the base. We have also pointed out that it is a matter
1

6Defense Base Act, 56 Stat. 1035, 42 U. S. C. § 1651 (1942). This
act extends the coverage of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act to "any employee engaged in any employment"(1) at any military, air, or naval base acquired after January 1,
1940, by the United States from any foreign government; or.
"(2) upon any lands occupied or used by the United States for
military or naval'purposes in any Territory.or possession outside the
continental United States (including Alaska; the Philippine Islands;
the United States Naval Operating Base, CGuantanamo Bay, Cuba;
and the Canal Zone); .. .
This extension was necessary because of the prior limited language
of the Act which covered injuries "occurring upon the navigable
waters of the United States," the. term "United States" being defined
to mean "the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia, including the 'territorial waters thereof." 44 Stat. 1424, 33
U. S. C.§§ 902,903.
It will be noted that Guantanamo Bay and the Canal Zone were
included in the lists as "possessions."

of statutory interpretation as to whether or not statutes

are effective beyond the limits of national'sovereignty. It
depends upon the purpose of the statute. Where as here
the purpose is to regulate labor relations in an area vital
to our national life, it seems reasonable to interpret its
provisions to have force where the nation has sole power,
rather than to limit the coverage to sovereignty. Such
an interpretation is consonant with the Administrator's

inclusion of the Panama Canal Zone within the meaning
of "possession."
We think these facts indicate an intention on the part
of Congress in its use of the word "possession" to have
the Act apply to employer-employee relationships on foreign territory under lease for bases. Such a construction
seems to us to carry out the remedial enactment in accord
with the purpose of Congress.'

dissenting.
The serious question in this case is not as to the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act. It means just what
it. says when it provides that it shall apply in any Territory or possession of the United States and I would

as matter of law that our tenure there constitutes the
leasehold area a possession obviously turns on a reading
of the lease from Great Britain.
The Court of Appeals read the lease to give "sweeping
powers" to the United States and declared that "the
areas are subject to fully as complete control by the
United States as obtains in other areas long known as
'possessions' of the United States." It names as comparable possessions Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam,
Samoan Islands, Virgin Islands and the Canal Zone.
This Court seems to approve that premise because it
affirms, citing some if not all of the same examples;
but it also says, ".

.

. it is difficult to formulate a

boundary to its [the Act's] coverage short of areas over
which the power of Congress extends,

. ..

to legislate

upon maximum hours and minimum wages.
Thus application of the Act to the leased area is put
.on two grounds: first, that the area is a possession of the
United States; and second, since the Act applies to those
"engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for
commerce," 2 it operates wherever Congress has power to
act with respect to commerce. Presumably the Court
will not shrink from apllying the converse of the latter
proposition; that the Act does not apply where this
country or its nationals are not engaged in commerce.
' This is the more striking because it is said concerning an Act
which we have held does not, even in continental United States,
exercise or purport to exercise the full scope of the commerce power.
See, e. g., McLeod v. Threlkeld, 319 U. S.491, 493; Kirschbaum Co.v.
Walling, 316 U. S.517.
2 Section 6 of the Act requires every employer (as defined therein)
to pay the prescribed rates to.each employee who is "engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce"; and § 7
forbids overtime employment, except at prescribed rates, of any
employee who is "engaged in commerce or in the production of goods
for commerce.,' 29 U. S. C. §§ 206,207.

Bermuda and like bases are not, in my opinion, our
possessions on a juridical and geopolitical footing with
the possessions enumerated. I also believe that there is
not and under the lease there can not be in the leased
area any "commerce" subject to the Act.
To consider the bases as possessions in that sense is
incompatible with the spirit of the negotiations and withthe letter of the lease by which the bases were acquired.
It enlarges the responsibilities which the United States
was willing to accept and the privileges which Great Britain was willing to concede. This will appear from the
history of the transaction whose meaning we interpret.
When organized resistance in the Low Countries and in
France went down and the German Wehrmacht stood
poised on Europe's Atlantic seaboard, it was suspected, as
it since has been proved, that the design for conquest embraced seizure of Atlantic islands as a pathway for future
operations against the United States
Disasters on land
and sea had brought threat of invasion of the British
Isles nearer to reality than at any time since the Spanish
On Octbber 29, 1940, Major (General Staff) Fre-herr von Falkenstein, from the Fuehrer's headquarters, wrote a secret "rsum of the
military questions current here."'' The 5th item thereof reads:
"The Fuehrer is at present occupied, with the question of the
occupation of the Atlantic Islands with a view to the prosecution
of war against America at a later date. Deliberations on this subject
are being embarked upon here. Essential conditions aie at the

"a. No other operational commitment,
"b. Portuguese neutrality,
"c. Support of France and Spain.
"A brief assessment of the possibilit y of seizing and holding air
bases and of the question of supply is needed from the GAF."

Armada. Consequently, Great Britain could divert no
forces to the defense of her island possessions in our hemisphere, which after all were strategic spots to assail our
commerce and stepping stones to our gateways.4 Great
Britain, however, desperately in need of destroyers to
defend her shores, intimated a readiness to put the United
States in a position to defend these islands and the Americas as a quid pro quo for overaged American destroyers.'
Among those who saw in the development of air warfare a necessity for moving our air defense outposts seaward from the cities which dot our own shores, an influential and respected group favored asking England to cede
her island possessions in this hemisphere to us as an outright transfer of sovereignty. If this cession had been.

even casually travelled in those islands, was the great disparity of social, economic and labor conditions between the
islands and our Continent. Also he knew full well the different customs and institutions prevailing there, particu-,
larly the relations between the white, colored and native
races, and the difficulty of assimilating them into the
American pattern-a prospect that would arouse emotional tensions in this country as well as. in the Islands
and which indeed cause(] some anxiety even in Westminster.' Thus it was settled American policy, grounded,
as I think, on the highest wisdom, that, whatever technical form the transaction shbuld take, we should acquire
no such responsibilities as would require us to import to
those islands our laws, institutions and social conditions
beyond the necessities of controlling a military base and
its garrison, dependents and incidental personnel.
Knowledge of that policy and purpose gives a measure
of the novel and dubious grounds for the Court's present
determination to put these bases upon the legislative and
juridical footing of "Territories and possessions." It is
a first step in'the direction of the very imprudence that
was sought to be avoided by the limited tenure devised
for the bases.
But if American interests neither require nor admit of
the assumption that the bases have become our possessions, the bounds of the grant as understood and expressed by Great Britain deny it with even more coinpelling force. The confined character of the granted privand consequently did not want to assume the burden of administering th~ose populations. Therefore he had changed, during my
absence from Washington, from his original idea of outright purchase
of the bases to that of ninety-nine-year leases.. I had originally
favored outright cession, but was willing to agree to leases instead."

ileges and their incompatibility with either sovereignty
or proprietorship on our part appear from the letter of the
M\arquess of Lothian to Secretary Hull of September 2,
1940, which committed the United Kingdom to grant
to the United States "the lease for immediate establishment and use of Naval and Air bases and facilities
for entrance thereto and the operation and protection
thereof," on the Great Bay of Bermuda.' All of the
specific provisions of the formal lease were' subsidiary to
and within this general measure of the rights yielded.
It comprehended all that it was intended to bestow and
all that we intended to take. Its dimensions were well
defined by Mr. Stimson as "the right to fortify and
defend." I
Details of the formal lease do but emphasize the common purpose of Great Britain to so confine the concession
and that of President Roosevelt to so circumscribe our
responsibilities. The leasehold right of the United States,
in war time or emergency, to conduct military operations
on land, water or in the air, which was the heart of the
matter for us, is without bounds or restrictions except
for a'pledge of good neighborliness and friendly cooperation in their exercise.
The leasehold terms, however, are well chosen, carefully
.to deny every commercial and political right to the United
States except as they are incidental and appurtenant to
this primary military usufruct. American nationals cannot go there for any purpose other than governmental
except in conformity to Bermudian laws. Its immigration laws' are relaxed only to admit "any member of
the United States Forces posted to a Leased Area" and

with His Majesty the King) employed by, or under
a contract with, the Government of the United States
in connection with the construction, maintenance, operation or defence of the Bases." Even so, the lessee must
submit to measures to identify such persons and to
establish their status. In what formerly recognized possession of the United States mentioned by the Court is
American citizens' privilege of ingress a-nd egress, of
transit and of residence, so limited?
Private trade and commerce by our citizens likewise are
wholly in control of the Colony and are no more dependent upon our laws than in any other part of the United
Kingdom or any foreign country. Bermudian customs
duties are waived only on material for construction and
maintenance of our bases, for consumption by our garrisons and supporting personnel, and on their household
goods; and we undertake to prevent abuse of this customs
privilege and to prevent resale of such imports. This
is not greater than the immunity allowed by every foreign
country to our diplomatic corps and staffs, and the power
reserved by Britain over imports and customs is wholly inconsistent with the concept that these are our possessions.
The lease also expressly and unconditionally provides
that no business can be established in the leased area and
that no person shall habitually render any professional,
services, except for the Government and its personnel.
No wireless or submarine cable may be operated except for
military purposes. Are such stifling restraints by another
state consistent with the idea of our possession?
Payment of local income and property taxes are only
waived as against those in the area when they are members of our armed forces, employees engaged in our works
or contractors with our Government. In short, no actual
possession of the United States used by the Court as a
standard of reference is so insulated from the United

States in fiscal, social, economic, commercial and political
affairs. In none is the commerce power of Congress so
stripped of subject matter for regulation or our permissible range of activity so circumscribed.
Possessions such as Puerto Rico, Guam, the guano islands, Samoa and the 'Virgin Islands, which the Court
mentions as standards for the treatment of Bermuda, are,
in vital respects, as different from it as night from day.
Not one of them is subject to even a frivolous claim adverse to our complete ownership. They belong to us or
they belong to no one. They are ceded territory over
which United States sovereignty is as complete and as
unquestioned as over the District of Columbia and they
are subject to no dual control or divided allegiance.
They are incorporated into our economy, freely trading in
our markets, and "protected" by our tariff walls. They
ar6 integrated with our social and, in some degree at least,
with our political life as well; some Of them being authorized to send delegates to our Congress.
On the other hand, however, Bermuda never has ceased
in its entirety to be a Crown Colony of Great Britain.
Social, industrial and labor conditions prevailing at the
Island bases are such that both nations made every effort
to insulate them from the damaging effects of our limited occupation for military purposes. It seems to me
unsound policy as well as capricious statutory interpretation for the Court blindly to mingle them by imposing
statutory policies that were not shaped with their
existence or peculiarities in mind. It may be that,
in some matters, the same policies suited to our legitimate possessions will also be considered adaptable to
the bases. But it is not necessarily or presumptively
so, and where the bases are to be brought into our scheme
of things, it should be deliberately and consciously done

which is our political superior in the island. We have no
commercial rights in Bermuda in the sense of private
enterprise such as Congress by this Act sought to regulate.
The United States cannot in good faith conduct or permit
its nationals to*engage in industry, manufacture or trade
there. It cannot authorize them to conduct commerce
there or to produce goods for commerce, which are the
conditions which this Act itself makes necessary to bring
the Labor Standards Act into play. To do so would be
a flagrant breach of good faith with the United Kingdom
and an overreaching of the people of Bermuda. Small
wonder that the Department of State feels constrained
to inform us that it "regards as unfortunate" the conclusion of the court below, which is now affirmed, and
adds a warning that any holding that the bases are "pos.sessions" of the United States in a political sense "would
not in the Department's view be calculated to improve
our relations with that Government."1

The Canal Zone has been cited as a possession with

United States, provides in Art. III that the United States

But the Panama Canal history may well be explanatory
of a paragraph of the Bermudian lease from Great Brit-,
ain, upon which the court below and respondent heavily
rely and which this Court cites as one of the significant
provisions. This clause provides that the "Leased Area
is not a part of the territory of the United States for
the purpose of coastwise shipping laws so as to exclude
British vessels from trade between the United States and
the Leased Areas." From this provision it is sought to
draw the conclusion that for all other purposes the area
is part of the territory of the United States. The remaining provisions of the identical paragraph are sufficient
to negative any idea that the territory becomes a United
States possession. -But coastwise shipping privileges
had been the subject of friction between the United States
and Great Britain over the Panama Canal and the plain
purport of the article is to say that we do not want to
repeat that experience. The Panama Canal Act of 1912,
37 Stat. 560, 562, exempted American coastwise shipping
from tolls, which the British Government represented to
be a violation of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of 1901 and
which it considered a corollary of the Clayton-Bulwer
Treaty of 1850. President Wilson recommended that
Congress repeal the exemption favoring American coastwise shipping as against British shipping 17 and the action

The other subparagraphs provide that the United States must

conform to the local system of lights and other navigation aids,
and report in advance to local authorities any such devices established or changed;' that the United States is exempt from local
pilotage laws; that British commercial vessels may use the-leased
areas on the same basis as American commercial vessels; and that
commercial United States aircraft cannot operate from the bases
for other than military purposes except by agreement with the United
Kingdom.

was taken only after a bitter and extensive debate." I.
think that the clause, instead of being read to create a
possession of the leased bases would, in the light of our
tendency to favor our shipping, be more accurately read

States. Everywhere else the language of the treaty [with Great
Britain] is given but one interpretation, and that interpretation
precludes the exemption I am asking you to repeal.
"We consented to the treaty [with Great Britain]; its language
we accepted, if we did not originate; and we are too big, too
powerful, too self-respecting a Nation to interpret with too strained
or refined a reading the words of our own promises just because
we have power enough to give us leave to read them as we please.
The large thing to do is the only thing that we can afford to do,
a voluntary withdrawal from a position everywhere questioned and
misunderstood.

whether we were right or wrong, and so once more deserve our

Guantanamo Naval Base, also referred to, is a leased
base in Cuba upon which we have agreed that "no person,

not to be a possession;1" it has not been listed by the

has shown that it has not .regarded the leased areas as
(possessions."
Heretofore it has been thought that the Court should
follow rather than overrule
the Executive department in
24
matters of this kind.
23

(a) In 1941 Congress sought to extend to the leased bases the

provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which covered death or disability from an injury occurring
upon the navigable waters of the United States. The "United States"
was therefore defined to mean "the several States and Territories and
the District of Columbia, including the territorial waters thereof."
44 Stat. 1424, 33 U. S. C. § 902. The amendment, c. 357, 55 Stat. 622,
made the Act applicable to injuries or death of covered employees at
any military, air or naval base acquired after January 1, 1940, by the
United States from any foreign government or any lands occupied-or
used by the United States for military or naval purposes in any Territok pr possession outside the continental United States, including
*Alaska, Guantanamo, and the Philippine Islands. This Act was
amended in 1942, c. 668, 56 Stat. 1028, 1035, and, as amended, lists
separately (1) bases acquired from foreign governments after January 1, 1940, and (2) lands used for military or naval purposes and
any Territory or possession, including Alaska, the Philippines, Guantanamo, ahd the Canal Zone. It is clear that in neither 1941 nor
1942 did the Congress consider that the term "possession" alone would
have extended coverage to the bases.
(b) The Act of March 27, 1942, c. 198, 56 Stat. 174, designed
to extend War Damage protection provides that such protection
shall be applicable only (1) to property situated in the United
States (including the several States and the District of Columbia),
the Philippine Islands, the Canal Zone, the territories and possessions
of the United States, and in such other places as may be determined
by the President to be under the dominion and control of the United
States. The terms of this Act, and its legislative history, indicate
that the final clause was added to cover areas such as these bases.
If the Congress had considered areas of this kind to be "possessions" such. a clause would scarcely have been necessary.
24 More than 100 years ago, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking
for a unanimous Court in Fostery.Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 307-309, said:

... In a controversy between two nations concerning national
boundary, it is, scarcely possible that the courts of either should

J., dissenting.

What I have said does not reflect the slightest doubt
about the power of Congress to make government contractors, doing work in Bermuda or anywhere else in the
world, whether in our own or in foreign possessions, pay
time-and-a-half for overtime or to enforce almost any
refuse to abide by the measures adopted by its own government ...
The judiciary is not that department of the government, to which
the assertion of its interests against foreign powers is confided; and
its duty'commonly is to decide upon individual rights, according to
those principles which the political departments of the nation have
established. If the course of the nation has been a plain one, its
courts would hesitate to pronounce it erroneous ..
"After these acts of sovereign power over the territory in dispute,
asserting the American construction of the treaty by which the government claims it, to maintain the opposite construction in its own
courts would certainly be an anomaly in the history and practice of
nations. If those departments which are entrusted with the foreign
intercourse of the nation, which assert and maintain its interests
against foreign, powers, have unequivocally asserted its rights of
dominion over a country of which it is' in possession, and which it
claims under a treaty; if the legislature has acted on the construction
thus asserted, it is not in its own courts that this construction is to
be denied. ... "
In an earlier case, The Amiable Isabella, 6 Wheat. 1, 71, Mr. Justice
Story had said: "In the first place, this Court does not possess
any treaty-making power. That power belongs by the constitution
to another department of the Government; and to alter, amend, or
add to any treaty, by inserting any clause, whether small or great,
important or trivial, would be on our part an usurpation of power,
and not an exercise of judicial functions. ....."
If, as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall stated, this -Court should not,
to deny rights asserted by the Executive, place a different interpretation on an agreement with another nation, a fortiori, it should not
do so' in order to assert rights which not only are not asserted by
our Executive or by the Congress, but are denied' by them and by
the other sovereign involved. And, to add, to the agreement under
which we occupy the leased areas, that as a matter of law the bases
have become our possessions, is certainly more than a trivial change
in that 'agreement, in direct contravention of the caution by Mr.
Justice Story.

labor policy upon them.2 The power of Congress, by
appropriate legislation, to govern such a relationship is
not impaired if we hold that the place where the contract
is perf6rmed is not our "possession." The holding that it
is a possession is not essential'to enable Congress to act but
serves only the purpose of expanding the coverage of this
Act to the bases without specific action by Congress. We
need *not resort to such an unwarranted and disturbing
interpretation of our relations with Bermuda and the
United Kingdom in order to preserve the full power of
Congress to extend all proper protection to the wages and
hours of all personnel at the base, because they are and
can be there only by virtue of government assignment or
government contracts.
In summary: Congress made the Act applicable in
our "possessions.". There is .po indication or reason to
believe that, had Congress Considered the matter, it would
have regarded our tenure in the Bermuda base as creating
a "possession," or would have applied an Act regulating
private employment to an area where no such private
enterprise could exist. There is no indication of a purpose to apply the Act to an exclusively military operation; indeed the Act indicates the contrary by exempting
government employees from its operation."6
It would not concern the United Kingdom, or the Colony of Bermuda, if the United States should require
its contractors to pay overtim e, upon any assumptions
which do not imply a possession adverse to theirs. But
I do think it will cause understandable anxiety if this
Court does it by holding, as matter of law, that the leased
areas are possessions of the United States, like those we

govern to the exclusion of all others. Such a decision
by this Court initiates a philosophy of annexation and
establishes a psychological accretion to our possessions
at the expense of our lessors, not unlikely to be received
in more critical quarters abroad as confirmation of the
suspicion that commitments made by our Executive are
lightly repudiated by another branch of our Government.
It should be the scrupulous concern of every branch of
our Government not to overreach any commitment or
limitation to which any branch has agreed.27

as well as any defenses which may be available to petitioner.
