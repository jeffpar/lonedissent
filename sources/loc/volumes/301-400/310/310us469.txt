adversely affected by the court's decision. It is not entitled to permissive intervention because no statute confers a conditional right to intervene and because it has
.no claim or defense which will be affected by any decision
of law or fact by the court. The cases in which bankruptcy courts have allowed creditors to raise questions

of venue or of jurisdiction to adjudicate under the terms

of the statute, where the proceeding would affect the
creditors' financial interest, are inapposite, as are also
equity receivership cases where an official intervenes in

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER ET AL.*
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 638.

Argued April 1, 2, 1940.-Decided May 27, 1940.

Members of a labor union, bent on unionizing a hosiery factory
in which but a few of them were employed, forcibly, aid in
violation of civil and criminal laws of the State, took possession
of the plant and held it during a protracted "sit-down" strike,
during which much of the machinery was willfully injured or
destroyed and during which the business, largely interstate, was
.entirely suspended. When the plant was seized there were on
hand 130,000 dozen pairs of finished hose, of atvalue of $800,000,
ready for shipment on unfilled orders,. mostly destined to points
outside of the State. Shipment was prevented by the strikers, who
repeatedly refused requests made by the owner for permission to

remove the merchandise for shipment in filling the orders. It was
not shown that the interruption of business caused by the strike
affected or was intended to affect competition and prices in the
market. Held:
1. That there was no conspiracy "in restraint of trade or commerc6 among the several States" within the meaning of the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act, and that, therefore, the District Court in a suit
by the employer, based on the Act, in which there was no diversity
of citizenship, was without jurisdiction to give judgment for the
damages suffered by the employer. First Coronado Case, 259 U. S.
3.44; United Leather Workers v. Herkert, 265 U. S. 457, followed.

Pp. 481, 486.
2. The effect of the strike was to restrict substantially the interstate transportation of the manufactured product, so as to bring
the acts causing it within the reach of the commerce power, but
the question for decision is not one of constitutional power but of
the extent to which Congress has exercised it under the Sherman
Act. P. 484.
3. The jury's verdict must be taken, in view of the instructions
of the court, as a finding supported by evidence that the strikers
intended to prevent shipments in interstate commerce in the sense
that they must be taken to. have intended the natural and probable
consequences of their acts. P. 485.
4. The liability of the strikers for damages under the Sherman
Act turns not on the power of Congress to regulate commerce, but
-on the extent to which Congress has exerted its power in the enactment of the law. P. 488.
5. In the application of the Sherman Act, it is the nature of the
restraint and its effect on interstate conmmerce and not the amount of
the commerce which are the tests of violation. Restraintsnot within
the Act when achieved by peaceful' means are not brought within it
merely because without other differences they are attained by
violence. P. 485.
6. Labor organizations and their activities are not wholly excluded
from the operation of the Sherman Act. P. 487.
7. The Sherman Act does not condemn all combinations and conspiracies which interrupt interstate transportation. P. 486.
8. The Act is to be interpreted in the light of its legislative
history and of the particular eiils at which it was aimed. P. 489.
9. The end sought by the Act was prevention of restraints to free
,'competition in business and commercial transactions which tend to
restrict production, raise prices or otherwise control the market to

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

Syllabus.

the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all
of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public
injury. P. 493.
10. The phrase "restraint of trade" had a well-understood meaning
at common law. The words "or commerce among the several States"
were added to relate the prohibited restraint of trade to interstate
commerce for constitutional purposes, so that Congress through its
commerce power, might suppress and penalize, restraints on the
competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce.
It was in this sense of preventing restraints on commercial competition that Congress exercised all the power it possessed. P. 494.
11. The contracts and combinations in restraint of trade made
illegal by the common law were contracts for the restriction or supprekion of competition in the market, agreements to fix prices,
divide marketing territories, apportion customers, restrict production
and the like practices, which tend to raise prices or otherwise take
from buyers or consumers the advantages which accrue to them from
free competition in the market. P. 497.
12. The Sherman law took over the common law concept of illegal
restraints by condemning them wherever they occur in or affect
commerce between the States. It extended its condemnation to
restraints effected by any combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, as well as by contract or agreement, having those
effects on the competitive system and on purchasers and consumers
of goods or services which were characteristic of restraints deemed
illegal at common law, and it gave both private and public remedies
for the injuries flowing from such restraints. P. 497.
13. Restraint on competition or on the course of trade in articles
moving in interstate commerce does not violate the Act, unless
the restraint is shown to have, or is intended to have, an effect
upon prices in the market or otherwise to deprive purchasers or
consumers of the advantages which they derive from free competition. P. 500.
14. A combination of employees necessarily restraining competition among themselves in the sale of their services to their employer
was not considered an illegal restraint of trade at common law
when the Sherman Act was adopted, either because it was not
thought to be unreasonable or because it was not-deemed a "reztlsint
of trade." P. 501.
15. Since the enactment of the declaration in § 6 of the Clayton
Act it would seem plain that restraints onthe sale of the employee's

472

310 U. S.

services to the employer are not in themselves combinations or,
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce under the Sherman
Act. P. 502.
16. The mere fact that strikes or agreements not to work, entered
into by laborers to compel employers to yield to their demands,
may restrict the power of such employers to compete in the market
with those not subject to such demands does not bring the agreements within the condemnation of the Sherman Act. P. 503.
17. This Court has held the Sherman Act inapplicable in cases
like the-pre ent in which local strikes, although conducted by means
illegal under local law, in a production industry, prevented interstate.
shipment of substantial amounts of the product but in which it
was not shown that the restrictions on shipments had operated to
restrain or were intended to restiain commercial competition in
some substantial way. P. 508.
18. The Sherman Act was not enacted to police interstate
transportation, or to afford -a remedy for wrongs which are actionable under state law and result-from combinations and conspiracies
which fall short, both in their purpose and effect, of any form of
market control of a commodity. P. 512.
19. The maintenance in our federal system of a proper distribution between state and national governments of police authority
and of remedies private and public for public wrongs is of farreaching importance. An intention to disturb the balance is not
lightly to-be imputed to Congress. P. 513.

apply. Its language is as broAd as the Commerce
Clause.
Despite the fau. that, during the fifty years since the
Sherman Act was enacted, it has constantly been contended
that labor unions are not subject to its provisions, the Act
has never been so limited in its interpretation. It has
long been firmly established by the decisions of this Court
without a single dissent, that labor organizations are subject to the Act, when, pursuant to a conspiracy, they engage
in unlawful activities which restrain or obstruct the free
flow of interstate commerce. Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S.
274; Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418;

The Sherman Act is violated when it is shown that acombination or conspiracy existed which resulted in a
restraint of commerce.
In construing the Act this Court has held that there is a
restraint of commerce in violation of the Act: When the
conspiracy affects commerce. Bedford Cut Stone Co. v.

commerce, even if ordinarily the conspirators' acts affected
commerce only indirectly, Coronado Coal Co. v. United

When respondents completely stopped petitioner's manufacturing and shipping operations, commerce was directly
affected and restrained.

474

OCTOBER TERM,. 1939.
Argument for Petitioner.

310 U.S.

The stoppage of operations of a plant "in the flow of
commerce" directly affects, burdens and restrains commerce. LaborBoardv. Jones & Laughlin, 301 U. S. 1, 41;
Labor Board v. Friedman-HarryMarks Clothing Co., 301
U. S. 58.
Both Congress, in enacting the National Labor Relations Act, and this Court, in sustaining it, have recognized
that under our existing economic structure the stoppage
of manufacturing and shipping operations in a single plant
"in the flow of commerce" directly burdens and restrains
commerce.
The decisions of this Court in the Jones & Laughlin apd
Friedman-HarryAlarks cases did not turn upon nor even
involve the scope of the word "affect" in the Labor Relations Act. In those cases, this Court found, as had Congress in the preamble to the Labor Relations Act, that
industrial strife caused by unfair labor practices in a
manufacturing plant results in the stoppage of its operations. The issue then was whether this stoppage of
operations had a direct effect upon commerce, for unless
the effect was direct, Congress would not have the power
to prohibit local practices resulting in such a stoppage.
When this Court decided that issue by holding that such
a stoppage did have a direct effect upon commerce, it
announced a legal principle in no way confined to nor
dependent on the use of the word "affect" in the Labor
Relations Act, but one which was equally applicable to
the present case or to any case where that is the issue to
be decided.
The question in those cases, it is said, was the constitutionality of the Labor Relations Act, whereas the question in the present case is the applicability of the Sherman
Act. While the ultimate question for decision in each
case is different, the issue upon which the answer to that
question depends is exactly the same, namely, whether
the effect upon commerce of a stoppage of operations is

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

Argument for Petitioner.

direct or indirect. Indeed, in the Jone & Laughlin case,
p. 38, this Court pointed out that the power of Congress
to pass the Labor Relations Act was to be determined by
the same test which this Court applies in determining
whether there is a restraint of commerce in violation of
the Sherman Act, namely, whether the conduct involved
directly affects commerce. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495, 546.
Therefore, the holding in the Jones & Laughlin and
Friedman-HarryMarks cases that the stoppage of operations in a single plant has a direct effect upon commerce
is conclusive of that same issue in the case at bar.
Even if it be said that the stoppage of petitioner's.manufacturing operations had but an indirect effect on
commerce, nevertheless, when respondents wrongfully
prevented the interstate shipments of the finished
merchandise Apex had on hand against orders, they thereby
directly restrained interstate commerce. Carterv. Carter
Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 303; United Leather Workers
v. Herkert, 265 U. S. 457, 463; Bedford Cut Stone Co.
v. Journeymen Stone Cutters' Assn.., 274 U. S. 37, 47;
Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S: 274; Duplex v. Deering, 254
U. S. 443.
The evidence clearly shows and the jury found that
respondents intended to restrain commerce.
The fact that respondents carried out their conspiracy
through the medium of a sit-down strike and with the
stated purpose of not surrendering possession of petitioner's plant until their demands were granted is complete
proof of their intent to restrain commerce. Such a conspiracy, by its very nature, contemplated the complete
throttling of petitioner's interstate commerce.
-Proof of an intent to restrain commerce having been
shown, it is immaterial whether respondents' conspiracy
is said to have directly or indirectly restrained commerce-.
in either case there is a violation of the Sherman Act.

Even in, the absence of the finding by the jury, respondents' intent to restrain commerce will be presumed
as a matter of law.
This Court has frequently declared, in Sherman 'Act
cases, that the conspirators are presumed to have intended
the necessary consequences of their acts and can not be
heard to say the contrary. United States v. Patten, 226
U. S. .525, 543; Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin, supra,
p. 40.
The "intent," -in the sense of.."purpose" or "ultimate
object," of the-,labor union, involved in every Sherman
Act case lheretofore decided by this Court, has merely been
to unionize the particular plant' involved or to obtain some'
-other union objective, rather than to restrain commerce.
Nevertheless this Court has squaely held that such an
ultimate object cannot justify ',restraint of commerce in
violation'of the-Sherman Act. Bedlfrd Cut Stone Co. v:

only became violative of the Sherman Act when they unreasonably control or restrain commerce. Because they
are otherwise lawful activities, the "rule of reason" furnishes a "yardstick" for determining when these lawful
activities have reached a point where they result in an
unlawful restraint of commercei
Where, however, commerce is directly restrained by acts
which in themselves are flagrantly unlawful, as in the case
at bar, such a restraint can never be considered 'reasonable" and therefore not in violation of the Sherman Act,
simply because the volume of commerce restrained is but
a small proportion of the national volume. Cf. Second

Mr. Isadore Katz for respondents.
The Sherman Anti-Trust Act does not apply to labor
unions.
The terms "contract-in restraint of. trade" and "combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade" must be given
their common law meaning, otherwise the entire Sherman
Act is unconstitutional and void.
At common law the terms "contract in restraint of
trade" and ' mbinations or conspiracies in restraint of
trade" did not apply to labor unions in their relation with
employers.
The Congressional debates establish the intent to
exclude labor unions from the purview of the Act.
Labor unions in their relations with employers were
not within that field of. common law which dealt with
combinations in restraint of trade.
The Court was in error in applying the Act to a labor
union in Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274.

478

OCTOBER TERM, 1939.
Argument for Respondents.

310 U. S.

The foregoing argument is independent of any consideration of § 6 of the Clayton Act. A consideration of
the history of the period immediately preceding and
accompanying the passage of the Clayton Act and of the
mischief to be remedied, as well as the general trend of
debate on § 6 of the Clayton Act in the Congress, sanctions
the conclusion that Congress meant to undo the decision
of the Court in Loewe v. Lawlor, supra. _Although the
Court adhered to the doctrine of Loewe v. Lawlorin Duplex
PrintingCo. v. Deering,254 U. S. 443, and in Bedford Cut
Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stonecutters Association, 274
U. S. 37, the Court should nevertheless overrule a construction of the Sherman Act which makes that statute
applicable to labor unions with respect to their relations
to employers.
To obviate the judicial construction of the Sherman
Act in Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, Congress enacted § 6 and
§ 20 of the Clayton Act.
In every case involving the Sherman Act, there are two
problems involved, one of jurisdiction and the other ofsubstance. The failure to differentiate these two problems distinguishes most of the significant labor cases
decided by the Court.
Even if the Sherman Act is applicable to labor unions,
and their activities, that Act has not been violated by the
respondents, because the local strike activities were not part
of a conspiracy directly aimed at interstate commerce nor
vitalized by an intent to monopolize the supply of the
article entering and ijoving in interstate commerce or to
fix the price of it-in interstate markets.
Local activities of employees on strike are not within
the reach of the federal power.
The case is squarely within First Coronado Coal Case,

In the case at bar the requisite intent was neither alleged nor proved. There was nothing more than concerted
action to unionize the mill by means of a sit-down strike
with the intent and purpose of preventing the petitioner
from carrying on its business.
The jury did not and indeed could not find the requisite
intent. The jury found an intent to conduct a sit-down
strike. First Coronado Coal Case, supra, p. 411; Industrial Association of San Francisco v. United States, 268

The damages which the petitioner seeks to recover in this
case are such as resulted from a trespass under the common
law, and to recover them the petitioner may bring an action in the state courts. Wilder Manufacturing Co. V.

The Labor Relations Act was formulated to complement
the Anti-Trust Act. In view of this, how can it be said
that the Sherman' Act, though it is, unable to fulfill its
fundamental purpose, has vitality against'labor organizations, which Congress believed would be able to achieve
that same purpose through the process of collective
bargaining?
Bargaining power may very well depend upon the strike
and the boycott. How can it be said that employees may
organize and form unions for the purpose of bargaining
collectively with-their erinployer, but that, if they engage
in a strike, which, to the degree that it is successful, necessarily stops production, they Tne-within the domain of
the Sherman Act?
The principle of collective bargaining requires that the.
organization extend its influence throughout the entire
industry. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central

Opinion of the Court.

310 U. S.

It is clear that the doctrine of the Second Coronado Case
has been overcome by.the policy underlying the Wagner
Act.
Section 13 of the Labor Relations Act specifically provides: "Nothiig in-this Act shall be construed so as to
interfere with or impede or diminish in. any way the right
to strike."
The Act and the decisions of this Court upholding its
constitutionality have not expanded the meaning of "commerce" nor extended the. application of the AntiTrust Act.
The Circuit Court of Appeals did not'err in holding
that. a substantial amount of the commbdity must be
involved in a violation of the Anti-Trust Act.
Application of the Sherman Act does not depend upon
the illegality of the means.

Petitioner, a Pennsylvania corporation, is engaged in

to be a conspiracy in violation- of the Sherman AntiTrust Act. 26 Stat. 209, 15 U. S. C. § 1. The trial to
a jury resulted in a verdict for petitioner- in the pum of
$237,310, respondents saving by proper motions and exceptions the question whether the evidence was sufficient
to establish .aviolation of the Sherman Act. 'The trial
judge trebled the verdict to $711,932.55, in conformity
to the provision of the Sherman Act as amended by § 4
of the Clayton Act, 1914, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S. C. § 15, and
gave judgment accordingly. The Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit reversed; 108 F. 2d 71, on the ground
that the interstate commerce restrained or affected by
respondents' acts was unsubstantial, the total shipment
of merchandise from petitioner's factory being less than

The facts are undisputed. Thre"was evidence from'

-

310 U. S.

May 6, 1937, when petitioner's factory was shut down,
members of the union, employed by other factories.in
Philadelphia who had stopped work, gathered at peti•tioner's plant. Respondent Leader, president of, the Federation, then made a further demand for a closed shop
agreement. When this was. refused Leader declared d
"sit down strike." Immediately, acts of violence against
petitioner's plant and the employees in charge of it were
committed by the assembled mob. It forcibly seized the
plant, whereupon, under union leadership, its members
were organized to maintain themselves as sit-down strikers
in possession of the plant, and it -remained in possession
until June 23, 1937, when the strikers were forcibly ejected
pursuant to an injunction ordered by the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 90 F.
2d 155, 159; reversed and dismissal ordered as moot in
Leader v. Apex Hosiery Co., 302 U. S.656.
The locks on all gates and entrances of petitioner's plant
were changed; only strikers were given keys. No others
were allowed to leave or enter the plant without permission
of the strikers. Duriig the period of their occupancy,.
the union supplied them with food, blankets, cots, medical
care, and paid them strike benefits. While occupying the
factory, the strikers wilfully wrecked machinery of great
value, and did extensive damage to other property and
equipment of the company. All manufacturing operations by petitioner ceased on May 6th. As the result of
the destruction of the company's machinery and plant, it
did not resume even partial manufacturing operations until
August 19, 1937. The record discloses a lawless invasion
of petitioner's plant and destruction of its property by force
and violence of the most brutal and wanton character,
under leadership and direction of respondents, and without
interference by the local authorities.
For more than three months, by reason of respondents'
acts, manufacture was suspended at petitioner's plant

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

Opinion of the Court.

and the flow of petitioner's product into interstate commerce was stopped. When the plant was seized, there
were on hand 130,000 dozen pairs of finished hosiery, of
a value of about $800,000, ready for shipment on unfilled
orders, 80 per cent. of which were to be shipped to points
outside the state. Shipment was prevented by the occupation of the factory by the strikers. Three times in the
course of the strike respondents refused requests made by
petitioner to be allowed to remove the merchandise for
the purpose of shipment in filling the orders.
Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or
conspiracy, in.restraint of trade or commerce among the
several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared
to be illegal." Only a single question is presented by the
record for our decision, whether the evidence wvhiQh. we
have detailed, whose verity must be taken to be established by the jury's verdict, establishes a restraint of trade
or commerce which the Sherman Act condemns.
It is not denied, and we assume for present purposes,
that respondents by substituting the primitive method
of trial by combat,1 for the ordinary processes of justice
and more civilized means of deciding an industrial dispute, violated the civil and penal laws of Pennsylvania

this suit, in which no diversity of citizenship of the parties is alleged or shown, the federal courts are without
authority to enforce state laws. Their only jurisdiction
is to vindicate such federal right as Congress has conferred on petitioner by the Sherman Act' and violence,

as will appear hereafter, however reprehensible, does nQt
give the federal courts jurisdiction.
At the outset, and before considering the more substantial issues which we regad as decisive of this cause,
it is desirable to remove from the field of controversy
certain questions which have been much argued here and
below, but which we think, in the circumstances of the
present case, are irrelevant to decision. We find abundant support for petitioner's contention -that the effect of
the, sit-down strike was to restrict substantially the interstate transportation of its manufactured product, so as
to bring the acts of respondents by which the restriction
was effected within the reach of the commerce power if
Congress has seen fit to exercise it. Cessation of petitioner's manufacturing operations, which respondents
*compelled, indubitably meant the cessation of. shipment
interstate. The effect upon the commerce resulted
naturally and inevitably from the cause. The occupancy
of petitioner's factory by the strikers prevented the shipment of the substantial amount of merchandise on hand
,when the strike was called. In point of the immediacy of
the effect of the strikers' acts upon the interstate transportation involved and of its volume, the case does not
differ from many others in which we have sustained the
Congressional exercise of the commerce power. The national power to regulate commerce is not restricted to that
which is nationwide in its scope. Here the strikers' activities were as closely related to interstate commercd and
affected it as. substantially as numerous other activities
not in themselves interstate commerce which have nevertheless been held'to be subject to federal statutes enacted
in the exercise of the commerce power.? More recently,

where the statute was by its terms applicable and the
question was of Congressional power, we have sustained
the application of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S.
C. §§ 151-166, regulating labor relations "affecting" interstate commerce to situations no more closely related to
the commerce than these, and where the interstate commerce affected was no greater in volume.' And in the
application of the Sherman Act, as we have recently had
occasion to point out, it is the nature of the restraint and
its effect on interstate commerce and not the amount of
the commerce which are the tests of violation. See
United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., ante, p. 224,
note 59. Cf. Labor Board v. Fainblatt, 306 U. S.
601, 606.
We think also, as petitioner contends, that the jury's
verdict must be taken as a finding supported by evidence
that respondents intended to prevent petitioner's shipments in interstate commerce in the sense that respondents must be taken to have intended the natural and
probable consequences of their acts. The trial court left
it to the jury to say whether the respondents intended to
restrain petitioner's interstate shipments, and charged
that in a suit to recover damages for violation of the
Sherman Act it was necessary for tit to find an intent on
the part of respondents to cause the prohibited restraint
of commerce,4 but that such intent might be inferred

from their acts in stopping petitioner's manufacture -of a
product largely and regularly shipped in interstate commerce. Concededly the purpose of thd strikers and their
principal objective were -to compel petitioner to yield to
their demands for a union shop, but it is a matter of common knowledge and experience that the stoppage of a
large manufacturing plant, which the strikers did intend,
whose* product is. distributed generally to consumers.
throughout the country, would prevent its shipments in
interstate commerce. We must take it from the jury's
verdict that this was known to the strikers as well as to
others. In addition there was specific testimony that the
strikers refused to permit the withdrawal -of the finished
merchandise from petitioner's factory for shipment.
But the Sherman Act admittedly does not condemn
all combinations and conspiracies which interrupt interstate transportation. United Mine Workers v. Coronado

not since been called on to decide.' .It is not seriously

Opinion of the Court.

contended here that a conspiracy to derail and rob an
interstate train, even though it were-laden with 100,000
dozen pairs of stockings, necessarily would involve a violation of the Sherman Act. This Court has never applied
the Act to laborers or to others as a means of policing
interstate transportation, and so the question to which we
must address ourselves is whether a conspiracy of strikers
in a labor dispute to stop the operation of the employer's
factory in order to enforce their demands against the employer is the kind of restraint of trade or commerce at
which the Act is aimed, even though a natural and probable consequence of their acts and the only effect on
trade or commerce was to prevent substantial shipments
interstate by the employer.
A point strongly urged in behalf of respondents in brief
and argument before us is that Congress intended, to
exclude labor organizations and their activities wholly
from the operation of the Sherman Act. To this the short
answer must be made that for the thirty-two years which
have elapsed siiace the decision of Loewe v. Lawlor, 208
U. S. 274, this Court, in its efforts to det&mine the true
meaning and application of the Sherman Act has repeat-.
edly held that the words of the act, "Every contract, combination . .. or conspiracy in restraint of trade or
commerce" do embrace to some extent and in some
circumstances labor unions and their activities; 6 and that
during that period Congress, although often asked to do
so, has passed no act purporting to exclude labor unions

wholly from the operation of the Act.- On the contrary
.Congresshas repeatedly enacted laws restricting or purporting to curtail the application of the Act to labor
organizations and their activities, thus recognizing that to
some extent not defined they remain subject to it.
Whether labor organizations and their activities are
wholly excluded from the Sherman Act is a question of
statutory construction, not constitutional power.' The
long time failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had
been judicially construed, and the enactment by Congress
of legislation which implicitly recognizes the judicial construction as effective, is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one. This
is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute

to labor unions has brought forth sharply conflicting views
both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the
matter has been fully brought to the attention of the public
and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the
statute.
'While we must regard the question whether labor unions
are to some extent and in some circumstances subject. to
the Act as settled in the affirmative, it is equally plain
that this Court has never thought the Act to apply to
all labor union activities affecting interstate commerce.
The prohibitions of the Sherman Act were not stated in
terms of precision or of crystal clarity and the Act itself
did not define them. In consequence of the vagueness of
its language, perhaps not uncalculated,o the courts have
been left to give content to the statute, and in the performance of that function-it is appropriate that courts should
interpret its word in the light of its legislative history
and of the particular evils at which the legislation was
aimed. Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S.

Coals v. United States, 288 U. S. 344., 359, 360.

or 'trust,' or the words 'restraint' or 'monopolize,' by precise and allinclusive definitions; and that these were' truly matters for judicial
consideration."
See also Senator Hoar who with Senator Edmunds probably
drafted the bill (see A. H. Walker, History of 'the Sherman Law
(1910), p. 27-28) in 36 Cong. Rec. 522, Jan. '6, 1903: "We undertook by law to clothe the courts with the power and impose on 'them
and the Department of Justice the duty of pieventing all combinations in restraint of trade. It was believed that thie phrase, 'in restraint of trade,' had a technical and well-understood meaning in the
law."

The critical words which circumscribe the judicial performance of this function so- far as the present case is
concerned are'"Every ... combination . . . or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce." Since in the pres-.
ent case, as we have seen, the natural and predictable
consequence" of the strike was the restraint of interstate
transportation the precise question which we are called
upon to decide is whether that restraint resulting from
the strike maintained to enforce union demands by coming a shutdown of.petitioner's factory is the kind of
pe 'll
"restraint of trade or commerce" which the Act condemns.
In considering whether union activities like the present
may fairly be deemed to be embraced within this phrase,
three circumstances relating to the history and application
of the Act which are of striking significance must first
be -taken into account. The legislative history of the
-Sherman .Act as well as the decisions of this Coirt interpreting it, show that it was not aimed at policing interstate transportation or movement of goods and property.
The legislative history and the voluminous literature
which was generated in the course of the enactment and
during fifty years of litigation of the Sherman Act give
no hint that such was its purpose." They do not suggest

that, in general, state laws or law enforcement machinery
were inadequate to prevent local obstructions or interferences with interstate transportation, or presented any2
problem requiring the interposition of federal authority.
In 1890 when the Sherman Act was adopted there were
only a few federal statutes imposing penalties for obstructing or misusing ii.terstate transportation." With
an expanding commerce, many others hive since been
enacted safeguarding transportation in interstate commerce as the need was seen, including statutes declaring
conspiracies to interfere or actual interference with interstate commerce by violence or threats of violence to be
felonies."1 It was another and quite a different evil at
the maintenance of the competitive system in industry." See also,

had become a matter of public concern. The end sought
was the prevention of restraints to free competition in

thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by fine of $10,000 or both."
But the application of the provisions of § 420a to labor unions is
restricted by § 420d, which provides: "Jurisdiction of offenses. Any
person charged with violating section 420a of this title may be prosecuted in any district in which any part of the offense has been
committed by him or by his actual associates participating with him
in the offense or by his fellow conspirators: Provided, That no court

diminish, or in any manner affect the rights of bona fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out'the legitimate objects thereof, as such
rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States."
It is significant that Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code, dealing with
"Offenses against Foreign and Interstate Commerce," and relating
specifically to acts of interstate transportation or, its obstruction,
makes no mention of the Sherman Act, which is made a part of the
Code which deals with social, economic and commercial results of
interstate activity, notwithstanding its criminal penalty.
"The history of the Sherman Act as contained in the legislative
proceedings is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that "business competition" was the problem considered and that the act was
designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect
on such competition.
On July 10, 1888, the Senate adopted without discussion a resolution offered by Senator Sherman which directed the Committee on
Finance to inquire into and report in connection with revenue bills,
"such measures as it may deem expedien to set aside, control, restrain, or prohibit all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or'
combinations between persons or corporations, made with a view, or

For that reason the phrase "restraint of trade" which,
as will presently appear, had awell-understood meaning at
which tend to prevent free and full competition . . .with such penalties and provisions . ;. as will tend to preserve freedom of trade
and production, the natural competition of increasing production, the
lowering of prices by such competition . . ." (19 Cong. Rec. 6041.)
This resolution explicitly presented the economic theory of the
proponents of such legislation.- The various bills introduced between
1888 and 1890 follow the theory 6f this resolution. Many bills sought
to make void all arrangements "made with a view, or which tend, to
prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or
sale of articles of domestic growth or production," S.3445; S.3510;
H. R. 11339, all of the 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) were bills of this
ti'pe. In the 51st Cong. (1889) the bills were in a similar vein.
See S. 1, § 1 (this bill as redrafted by the Judiciary Committee ultimately became the Sherman Law); H. R. 202, § 3; H. R. 270; H. R.
286; H. R. 402; H. R. 509; H. R. 826; H. R. 3819. See Bills and Debates'in Congress relating to Trusts (1909), Vol. 1, pp. 1025-1031.
Only one, which was never enacted, S. 1268 in the 52d Cong., 1st
Sess: (1892), introduced by Senator Peffer, sought to prohibit "every
wilful act . . .which shall have the effect to in anyway interfere
with the freedom of transit of articles in interstate commerce, . . ."
When the antitrust bill (S.1, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.), came before
Congress for debate, the-debates point to a similar purpose. Senator
Sherman asserted the bill prevented only "business combinations"
"made with a view to prevent competition," 21 Cong. Rec. 2457,
2562; see also ibid. at 2459, 2461.
Senator Allison spoke of combinations which "control prices," ibid.
2471; Senator Pugh of combinations "to limit production" for "the
pfirpose of destroying competition," ibid. 2558; Senator Morgan of
combinations "that affect the p'iice of commodities," ibid. 2609;
Senator Platt, a critic of the bill, said this bill proceeds on the
.assumption that "competition is beneficent to the, country," ibid.
2729; Senator George denounced trusts which crush out competition "and that is the great evil at which all this legislation ought to
be directed," ibid. 3147.
In the 'House, Representative Culberson, who was in charge of the
bill, interpreted the bill tor prohibit various arrangements which tend
to drive out competition, ibid. 4089; Representative Wilson spoke
in favor'of the bill against combinations among "competing producers

common law, was made the means of defining the activities prohibited. The addition of the words "or commerce
among the several states" was not an additional kind of
restraint to be prohibited by the Sherman Act but was
the means used to relate the prohibited restraint of trade
to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes, Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U. S. 427,
434, so that Congress, through its commerce power, might
suppress and penalize restraints on the competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce.
Because many forms of restraint upon commercial
competition extendet across state lines so as to make
regulation by state action difficult or impossible, Congress enacted the Sherman kct, 21 Cong. Rec. 2456. It
was in this sense of preventing restraints on commercial
competition that Congress exercised "all the power it
possessed." Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States,
supra, 435.
A second significant circumstance is that this Court
has never applied the Sherman Act in any case, whether
or not involving labor organizations or activities, unless
the Court was of opinion that there was some form of
restraint upon commercial competition in the marketing
of goods or services 1 6 and finally this Court has refused
the terms on which they shall sell in the market, and may secure
release from the stress of competition among themselves," ibid. 4090.
The unanimity with which foes and supporters of the bill spoke
of its aims as the protection of free competition, permit use of the
debates in interpreting the purpose of the act. See White, C. J., in

to apply the Shermal Act in cases like the present in
which local strikes conducted by illegal means in a
or condoned had a substantial effect on competition in the industry,
nevertheless in most of them, particularly in the cases arising since

the development of.the "rule of reason" in 1912, emphasis was placed
on the "competitive conditions in the indusfry."
In Addyston Pipe &'Steel Co. v. United-States, 175 U. S. 211,
arising before the "rule of reason," Justice Peckham adopted 'Judge
Taft's statement of the case in his opinion in the Circuit Court of
Appeals, pointing out that within substantial parts of the United
States, price competition had been practically eliminated (see page
236). Standard Oil Co. v: United States, 221 U. S. 1, which heralded
the "rule of reason" stressed intent to eliminate competition and the
piedatory practices by which competition had actually been eliminated. United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U: S. 106,
decided the same day, involved a trust which dominated the whole
industry and exercised its power in securing price control. In both
the Oil case and the Tobacco case,, decisions were specifically rested
on the ground that the condemned combinations "unduly restricted
competition."
A combination of two great railroads resulting in "destroying or
greatly abridging the free operation of competition theretofore existing" was enjoined in United States v. Union Pacific Co., 226 U. S. 61.
But where the majority of the Court was of opinion that the evidence
did not show that the combination "ever possessed or exerted sufficient power when acting alone to control prices of the products of
the industry," the Sherman Act was held not to apply to the combination, United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U. S. 417.

The common law doctrines relating to contracts and
combinations in restraint of trade were well understood
long before the enactment of the Sherman law.'
They
were contracts for the restriction or suppression of competition in the market, agreements to fix prices, divide
marketing territories, apportion customers, restrict
production and the like practices, which tend to raise
prices or otherwise take from buyers or consumers the
advantages which accrue to them from free competition
in the market. Such contracts were deemed illegal and
were unenforcible at common law. But the resulting
restraints of trade were not penalized and gave rise to no
actionable wrong. Certain classes of restraints were not
outlawed when deemed reasonable, usually because they
served to preserve or protect legitimate interests, previously existing, of one or more parties to the contract. 8

effected by the concentrated commercial power of "trusts"
and "comibinations" at the close of the nineteenth century,
the legislators found ready at their hand the common law
concept of illegal restraints of trade or commerce. In
enacting the Sherman law they took over that concept by
condemning such restraints wherever they occur in or
affect commerce between the states. They extended the
condemnation of the statute to restraints effected by any
combination in the form of trust 'or otherwise, or conspiracy, as well as by contract or agreement, having those
effects on the competitive system and on purchasers and
consumers of goods or services which were characteristic
of restraints deemed illegal at common law, and they gave
both private and public remedies for the injuries flowing
from such restraints.
That such is the scope and effect of the Sherman Act
was first judicially recognized and expounded in the classic
opinion in United States V. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85
F. 271,-affirmed 175 U. S. 211, written by Judge, later
Chief Justice, Taft, and concurred in by Justice Harlan and
Judge, later Justice, Lurton, of this Court. This Court
has since repeatedly recognized that the restraints at which
the Sherman law is aimed, and which are described by its
terms, are only those which are comparable to restraints
deemed illegal at common law, although accomplished by
means other than contract and which, for constitutional
reasons, are confined to transactions in or which affect
interstate commerce.19

469

Opinion of the Court.

In StandardOil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 54,55,
58, decided in 1911, this Court, speaking through Chief
Justice White, pointed out that the restraint of trade
contemplated by § 1 of the Act took its origin from the
common law, and that the Sherman Act was adapted to
the prevention, in modern conditions, of conduct or dealing effecting the wrong, at which the common law doc-

trine was aimed. This, it was said, is "the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was

thought would flow from the undue limitation on dompetitive conditions caused by contracts or other acts of
individuals or corporations, . . ." 11 The Court declared,
page 59, that "the statute was drawn in the light of the
existing practical conception of the law of restraint of
trade," and drew the conclusion that the restraints which
were condemned by the statute are those which, followingthe common law analogy, are "unreasonable or undue."
This view was followed and more explicitly stated in
United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106,
"Without going into detail and but very briefly surveying the
whole field, it may be with accuracy said that the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow
from the undue limitation on competitive conditions caused by contracts ur other acts of individuals or corporations, led; as a matter
of public policy, to the prohibition or treating as illegal all contracts
or acts which were unreasonably restri r ve of competitive conditions, either from the nature or character of the contract or act or
where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the
conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed with
the legitimate Durpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and
developing trade, but' on the contrary were of such a character as to
give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered
into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and
to limit the right of individuals, thun restraining the free flow of
commerce and tending :' bring about the evils, such as enhancement
of prices, which were considered to be against public policy." Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, at 58.

500

Opinion of the Court.

179, where it was said: "... it was held in the Standard
Oil case that as the words 'restraint of trade' at common
law and in the law of this country at the time of the
adoption of the Anti-trust Act only embraced acts or'
contracts or agreements or combinations which operated
to the prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the due course
of trade or which, either because of their inherent nature
or effect or because of the evident purpose of the acts,
as used
etc., injuriously restrained trade, that tbi
in the statute were designed to have and did have but a
like significance." In thus grounding the "rule of reason"
upon the analogy of the common law doctrines applicable
to illegal restraints of trade tLe Court gave a content and
meaning to the statute in harmony with its history and'
plainly indicated by its legislative purpose. Labor cases
apart, which will presently be discussed, this Court has
not departed from the conception of the Sherman Act as
affording a remedy, public and private, for the public
wrongs which flow from restraints of trade in the common
law sense of restriction or suppression of commercial
competition. In the cases considered by this Court since
the Stanzdard Oil case in 1911 some form of restraint of
commercial competition has been the sine qua non to the
condemnation of contracts, combinations or conspiracies
under the Sherman Act, and in general restraints upon
competition have been condemned only when their purpose or effect was to raise or fix the market price.' It
is in this sense that it is said that the restraints, actual
or intended, prohibited by the Sherman Act are &nly
those which are so substantial as to affect market prices.
Restraints on competition or on the course of trade in,

merce is not enough, unless Othe restraint is shown to
have or is intended to have an effect upon prices in the
market or otherwise to deprive purchasers or consumers of the advantages which they derive from free competition. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, 246
U. S. 231, 238; United States v. United States Steel Co.,
251 U. S. 417; Cement Manufacturers Assn. v. United
States, 268 U. S. 588; United States, v. International
Harvester Co., 274 U. S. 693; Appalachian Coals v. United
States, 288 U. S. 344, 375, et seq.22
The question remains whether the effect of the combination or conspiracy among respondents was a restraint
of trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act. This
is not a case of a labor orgaiization being used by combinations of those engaged in an industry as the means
or instrument for suppressing competition or fixing prices.
See United States v. Brims, 272 U. S. 549; Local 167 v.
United States, 291 U. S. 293. Here it is plain that the
combination or conspiracy did not have as its purpose
restraint upon competition in the market for petitioner's
product. Its object was to compel petitioner to accede
to the union demands and an effect of it, in consequence
of the strikers' tortious acts, was the prevention of the
removal of petitioner's product for interstate shipment.
So far as appears the delay of these shipments was not
intended to have and had no effect on prices of hosiery
in the market, and so was in that respect no more a
restraint forbidden by the Sherman Act than the restriction upon competition and the course of trade held lawful in AppalachianCoals v. United States, supra, because
notwithstanding its effect upon the marketing "of the coal

acts, prejudice the public interests by unduly restricting competition

it nevertheless was not intended to and did not affect
market price.
A combination of employees necessarily restrains competition among themielves in the sale of their services
to the employer; yet such a combination was not considered an illegal restraint of trade at common law when
the Sherman Acf was adopted, either because it was not
thought to be unreasonable or because it was not deemed
a "restraint, of trade." 23 Since the enactment of the
Combinations of capital and labor have seldom been treated as
phases of a general movement to suppress competition. See Taft,
Anti-Trust Act and the Supreme Court (1914), p. 21; Seager, The
Attitude of the State Towards Trade Unions and Trusts, 22 Pol. Sci.
Q. 385 (1907); Commons and Andrews, Principles of Labor Legislation (1927), pp. 125-129.
In England prior to 1824 the two types of combinations were
treated as substantially the same, the Combinations Acts (39 Geo.
III, c. 81; 39 & 40 Geo. III, c.106), preventing combinations of wage
earners even for the more obvious purpose of securing higher wages
or shorter hours. These restrictions have been removed by various
Acts (e. g. 5 Geo. IV, c.95, s. 2; 22 Vict., c.34; 34 & 35 Vict., c. 31,
s. c.; 38 & 39 Vict. 36) until the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 (6
Edw. VII, c. 47) which clearly encourages the combinations of workmen. See Henderson, Trade Unions and the Law (1927). Compare
the English treatment of capital combirations, see, The Anti-Trust
Laws of the British Commonwealth of Nations, 32 Col. L. Rev. 324.
The experience in the United States has paralleled that in England. In a few early cases all labor combinations were regarded
as unlawful, Groat, Attitude of American Courts in Labor Cases,
42 Col. Univ. Studies (1911) pp.- 36-38, but since Commonwealth
v. Hunt, 4 Metcalf 111 (Mass. 1842), the legitimate scope of labor
combinations has steadily expanded, see Frankfurter and Greene, The
Labor Injunction (1930), c.I; Landis, Cases on Labor Law (1934),
pp. 32-34. In addition to this difference in treatment reflected in
judicial decisions, many states'have by legislation accorded favorable
treatment to unions on other matters. See collection* of legislation
favorable to unionism found in United Mine Workers v. Coronado
Coal Co., 259 U. S.344, 386, note 1; Bull. No. 370, Labor Laws of

declaration in § 6 of the Clayton Act that "the labor of
a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce . . . nor shall such [labor] organizations, or the
members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in the restraint of trade under
the antitrust laws," it would seem-plain that restraints
on the sale of the employee's services to the employer,
however much they curtail the competition among employees, are not in themselves combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce under the Sherman
Act.
Strikes or agreements not to work, entered into bylaborers to compel employers to yield to their demands,
may restrict to some extent the power of employers who
are parties to the dispute to compete in the market with
those not subject to such demands. But under the doctrine
applied to non-labor cases, the mere fact of such restrictions on competition does not in itself bring the parties
to the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman
Act. Appalachian Coals v. United States, supra, 360.
Furthermore, successful union activity, as for example
consummation of a wage agreement with employers, may
have some influence on price competition by eliminating
that part of such competition which is based on differences
in labor standards. Since, in order to render a labor combination effective it must eliminate the competition from
non-union made goods, see American Steel Foundries v.
Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184, 209, an
elimination of price competition based on differences in
labor standards is the objective of any national labor
organization. But this effect on competition has not been

Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, supra; cf. American Foundries
case, supra, 209; National Association of Window Glass
Mfrs. v. United States, 263 U. S. 403.4 And in any case,
the restraint here is, as we have seen, of a different kind
and has not been shown to have any actual or intended
effect on price or price competition.
"Federal legislation aimed at protecting and favoring labor organizations and eliminating the competition of employers and employees
based on labor conditions regarded as 'substandard, through the
establishment of industry-wide standards both by collective bargaining and by legislation setting up minimum wage and hour standards,
supports the conclusion that Congress does not regard the effects
upon competition from such combinations and standards as against
public policy or condemned by the Sherman Act.
The Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29. U. S. C. §§ 101-115,
limiting the use of injunctions in labor disputes, is predicated on the
policy that "under prevailing economic conditions," it is -necessary
that the worker "have full freedom of association . . . to negotiate
the terms and conditions of his employment." The Railway Labor
Act of 1934, A8 Stat. 1185, 45 U. S. C. §§ 151-164, provided for
independence of railroad employees in the matter of self-organization.
The National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. §§
151-166, was passed to protect the workers in the "exercise of full
freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosihg for the purpose of negotiating the
terms and conditions of their employment . . .' and expressly protects the right of self-organization, recognizes the strike as a proper
union weapon and permits closed-shop contracts.
The Public Contracts Act, 49 Stat. 20W6, 41 U. S. C. §§ .35-48, was
aimed at preventing price competition in government bidding based
on wage cutting and authorizes the establishment of minimum wage
standards. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060,
29 U. S. C. §§ 201-219, likewise seeks to eliminate competition which
thrived upon low wages and substandard working conditions.
This series of acts clearly recognizes that combinations of workers
eliminating competition among themselves and restricting competition among their employers based on wage cutting are not contrary to
the public policy.

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LE&DER.
469

Opinion of the Court.

This Court first applied tht Sherman Act to a labor
organization in Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, in 1908,
holding that the trial court had erroneously sustained a
demurrer to the declaration in a suit for daaages for
violation of the Sherman Act on the ground that the combination alleged was not within the Act. The combination or conspiracy charged was that of a nation-wide
labor organization to force all manufacturers of fur hats
in the United States to organize their workers by maintaining a boycott against the purchase of the product of
non-union manufacturers shipped in interstate commerce.
The restraint alleged was not a strike or refusal to work
in the complainants' plant, but a secondary boycott by
which, through threats to the manufacturer's wholesale
customers and their customers, the Union sought to
compel or induce them not to deal in the product of the
complainants, and to purchase the competing products of
other unionized manufacturers. This Court pointed out
that the restraint was precisely like that in Eastern
States Retail Lumber Dealers Co. v. United States, 234
U. S.600,. 610, 614, in which a conspiracy to circulate a
'%lack list," intended to persuade retailers not to deal
with specified wholesalers, was held to violate the Act
because of its restraint upon competition with unlisted
wholesalers. The Court in the Loewe case held that the
boycott operated as a restraint of trade or commerce
within the meaning of the Sherman Act, and that the
language of the Act, "every combination, etc." was broad
enough to include a labor union imposing such a restraint.
Like problems found a like solution in Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering, -254 U. S.443, and in Bedford Cut
Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stone Cutters Assn., 274 U. S,
37; where, in the one case, a secondary boycott, and in'
the other, the refusal of the union to work on a product in
the hands of the purchaser, were carried on on a countrylabor organization, in order to
wide scale by a national

induce the purchasers of a manufactured product shipped
in interstate commerce to withdraw their patronage from
the producer. In both, as in the Loewe case, the effort
of the union was to compel unionization of an employer's
factory, not by a strike in his factory but by restraining,
by the boycott or refusal to work on the"manufactured
product, purchases of his product in interstate commerce
in competition with the like product of union shops.
In the Bedford Stone case it was pointed out that, as in
the Duplex Printing Press Co. case, the strike was directed against the use of the manufactured product by
consumers "with the in'mediate purpose and effect of
restraining future sales and shipments in interstate commerce" and "With the plain design of supprussing or narrowing the interstate market," and that in this respect
the case differed from those in which a factory strike,
directed at-the prevention of production with consequent
cessation of interstate shipments, had been held not to be
a violation of the Sherman law. See First Coronado
case, supra;Leather Workers case, supra;cf. Second Coronado case, supra,310.
It will be observed that in each of these cases where
the Act was held applicable to labor unions, the activities
affecting interstate commerce were directed at control of
the market and were so widespread as 'substantially to
affect it. There was thus a suppression of competition
in the market by methods which were deemed analogous
to those found to be violations in the non-labor cases.
See Montague & Co. v. Lowry, 193 U. S. 38, 45, 46;
Retail Lumber Dealers Co. v. United States, supra,
ParamountFamous Lasky Co. v. United States, 282 U. S.
30; United States v. First National Pictures, 282 U. S.
44. That the objective of the restraint in the boycott
cases was the strengthening of the bargaining position of
the union and not the elimination of business competition-which .was the end in the non-labor cases-was

Opinion of the Court.

thought to be immaterial because the Court viewed the
restraint itself, in contrast to the interference with shipments caused by a local factory strike, to be qf a, kind
regarded as offensive at common law because of its effect
in curtailing a free market and it was held to offend
against the Sherman Act because it effected and was
aimed at suppression of competition with union made
goods in the interstate market.
Both the Duplex PrintingCo. and Bedford Stone cases

followed the enactment of the Clayton Act and the recognition of the "rule of reason" in the Standard Oil case,
supra. The applicability of that rule to restraints upon
commerce affected by a labor union in order to promote
and consolidate the interests of its union was not considered.25 But an important'point considered and decided
by the Court in both cases was that nothing in the Clayton
Act precluded the relief granted. We are not now concerned with the merits of either point.' The only
Whether the interest of the labor unions in these cases in maintaining and extending their respective organizations, rendered the
restraint reasonable as a means of attaining that end within the
common law rule, or brought the restraints within the nile of reason
developed and announced in the Standard Oil case, was not discussed and we need not consider it here. Restraints upon the competitive marketing of a manufacturer's product brought about by an
agreement between the employer and his employees in order to
secure continuous employment of the employees was held to be
within the rule of reason and therefore not an unreasonable restraint
of trade in National Association of Window Glass Mfrs. v. United
States, 263 U. S. 403.
'Section 6 of the Clayton Act declared that "nothing contained
in the anti-trust laws shall be construed . . . to forbid or restrain
individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out
the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the
members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or
conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the anti-trust laws.' And

shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or

significance of t e two cases for present purposes is that
in each the Court considered it necessary, in order to
support its decision, to find that the restraint operated
to suppress competition in the market.
This Court was first called on to consider a case like.
the present in the First Coronado case, supra. There a
local branch of a national labor union sought to unionize
a coal mine which was shipping its product interstate to
the extent of more than 5,000 tons a week. Members
of the union compelled the mine to shut down, by force
and violence, including murder and arson. By reason of
their forcible action all work at the mine was prevented,
it filled with water, shipments of coal which were regularly moving in interstate commerce as mined, ceased, and
the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees,
or between employers and emplcyees . . . involving, or growing out of,
a dispute concerning terms or- conditions of employment, unless
necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property

right. . ...

"And no such restraining oider or injunction shall prohibit any
person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating
any relation of employment or from ceasing to perform any work
or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by
peaceful means so to do; . . . or from ceasing to patronize or to
employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising,
or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; ...
nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered
or held to be violations of any law of the United States."
In both the Duplex Printing Press Co. and the Bedford tone
Cutters cases, it-was held that the prohibition of § 6 of the Clayton
Act did not extend to illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint
of trade, which the concerted action taken by the labor unions in,
these cases was held to be, and that the restrictions of § 20 of the
Clayton Act upon the injunction applied only. to actual disputes
between an employer and his employees, with respect to the-terms or
conditions of their own .employment, and did not extend to acts of
labor unions, boycotting the product of an employer by whom they
were not employed. Cf. New Negro Alliance v. Sanitarv Grocery

the strikers burned more than ten cars, three of them
loaded with coal and some billed for movement interstate.
This Court, notwithstanding the admittedly substantial
effect of the strike on the interstate movement of the coal,
and the admittedly illegal and outrageous acts of the
strikers, held that it was not a restraint of trade br commerce prohibited by the Sherman Act. It rested its decision specifically on two grounds: that "obstruction to
coal mining is not a direct obstruction to interstate commerce in coal," " and that the intent to obstruct the mining of coal and to burn the loaded cars, did not necessarily
imply an intent to restrain the commerce, although con-'
cededly interstate shipments and the filling of interstate
orders for coal were necessarily ended by the stoppage of
mining operations and the destruction of the loaded cars.
It perhaps suffices for present purposes to say that if the
strike in the Coronado case was not within the Sherman
Act because its effect upon the commerce was "indirect"
and because" the "intention" to shut down the mine and
destroy the cars of coal destined for an interstate shipment, did not imply an "intention to obstruct interstate
commerce," then the lik6 tests require the like decision
here.
But we are not relegated to so mechanical an application of these cryptic phrases in the application of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act, for the Court has since so in=The assertion that the decision in the First Coronado case rests
on the ground that "production, as such-in that case, coal miningwas not interstate commerce" is neither supported by the opinion in
that case nor by its subsequent interpretation by this Court. See
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States; 295 U. S. 495; 548; Labor
Board v. Jones & Laughlin Co., 301 U. S. 1, 40. See note 9, supra.
Cf. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, ante, p. 381. The opinion
recognized that the cessation of production of the coal prevented interstate commerce in the coal but held that it did not violate the Sherman Act because the effect on the commerce was "indirect," to which
it was thought the Sherman Act did not abply.

terpreted them as to give to the phrase "restraint of
trade or commerce" a meaning and content consonant
with the legislative and judicial history of the Act to
which we have referred. In the Leather Workers case,
supra,the Court was again called on to determine whether
a local strike in a factory which prevented shipment of
its product in filling interstate orders of, substantial volume violated the Sherman Act. As in the First Coronado
case the Court held that the restraint was not one prohibited by. the Sherman Act. It pointed out, page 469,
that there has been no attempt, as in Loewe v. Lawlor,
to boycott the sale of complainant's products in other
states, and that if the interruption of interstate shipments
resulting from a local factory strike aimed at compelling
the employer to yield to union demands were deemed
within the sweep of the Sherman Act, "The natural,
logical and inevitable result will be that every strike in
any industry or even in any single factory will be within
the Sherman Act and subject to federal jurisdiction provided any appreciable amount of its product enters into
interstate commerce," page 471. After discussing the
cases which had given currency to the notion that the
Sherman Act, where the combination or conspiracy is
not formed with the "intent to restrain trade or commerce," is to be applied only to those restraints charactefized as "direct," the Court said, page 471:
"This review of the cases makes it clear that the mere
reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in
interstate commerce, by the illegal- or tortious prevention
of its manufacture, is ordinarily an indirect and remote
obstruction to that commerce. It is only when the intent or necessary effect upon such commerce in the article
is to enable those preventing the manufacture to monopolize the supply, control its price or discriminate as between
its would-be purchasers, that the unlawful interference

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

Opinion of the Court.

with its manufacture can be said directly to burden
interstate commerce."
And the Court added,
"The record is entirely without evidence or circumstances to show tha*t the defendants in their conspiracy
to deprive the complainants of their workers were thus
'directing their scheme against interstate commerce."
It was thus made apparent that in saying that "indirect
obstructions" to commerce were not condemned by the
Sherman Act where the conspiracy is not directed at that
commerce, the Court was not seeking to apply a purely
mechanical test of liability, *but was using a shorthand
expression to signify that the Sherman Act was directed
only at those restraints whose evil consequences are derived from the suppression of competition in the interstate market, so as "to monopolize the supply, control
its price or discriminate between its would-be purchasers."
And in speaking of intent as a prerequisite to liability
under the Act where the restraint to interstate commerce
is "indirect" it meant no more than that the conspiracy
or combination must be. aimed or directed at the kind
of restraint which the Act- prohibits or that such restraint isthe natural and probable consequences of the
conspiracy.
This was again pointed out in the Second Coronadocase,
supra,310, where upon a retrial of the case on amended
pleadings it appeared that "the purpose of the destruction
of the mines was to stop the production of non-union coal
and prevent its shipment to markets of other states than
Arkansas, where it would by competition tend to reduce
the price of the commodity and affect injuriously the
maintenance of wages for union labor in compet4i
mines, . . ." The Court declared such a restraint to be a
"direct violation of the Sherman Act." The like distinction was taken and explanation made in the Bedford Stone

case, supra, pp. 46, 49, where the restraint consisted in the
refusal of the unions to work on stone shipped interstate
from an open shop quarry after its interstate journey to
the purchaser had ended, and where it appeared that the
purpose of the strike was to prevent the interstate sale of
the stone in competition with the product of unionized
producers. Cf. Levering & "Garrigues Co. v. Morrin,
supra.
These cases show that activities of labor organizations
not immunized by the Clayton Act are not necessarily
violations of the Sherman Act. Underlying and implicit
in all of them is recognition that the Sherman Act was
not enacted to police interstate transportation, or to afford
a remedy for wrongs, which are actionable undef state
law, and result from combinations and conspiracies which
fall short; both in their purpose and effect, of any form
of market control of a commodity, such as to "monopolize
the supply, control its price, or discriminate between its
would-be purchasers." These elements of restraint of
trade, found to be present in the Second Coronadocase and
alone to distinguish it from the FirstCoronadocase and the
Leather Workers case, are wholly lacking here. We do not
hold that conspiracies to obstruct or prevent transportation
in interstate commerce can in no circumstances be violations of the Sherman Act. Apart from the Clayton Act
it makes no distinction between labor and non-labor cases.
We only hold now, as we have previously held both in
labor and non-labor cases, that such restraints are not
within the Sherman Act unless they are intended to have,
or in fat have, the effects on the market on which the
Court relied to establish violation in the Second Coronado
case. Unless the principle of these cases is now to be
discardedj an impartial application of the Sherman Act to
the activities of industry and labor alike would seem to
require that the Act be held inapplicable to the activities
of respondents whih had an even less substantial effect'

on the competitive conditions in the industry than the
combination of producers upheld in the Appalachian Coals
case and in others on which it relied.28
If, without such effects on the market, we were to hold
that a lol factory strike, stopping production and shipment of its product interstate, violates the Sherman law,
practically every strike in modern industry would be'
brought within -the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
under the Sherman Act, to remedy local law violations.
The Act was plainly not intended to reach such a result,
its language does not require it, and the course of our
decisions precludes it. The maintenance in our federal
system of a proper distribution between state and
national governments of police authority and of remedies
private and public for public wrongs is of far-reaching importance. An intention to disturb the balance is not
lightly to be imputed to Congress. The Sherman Act is
concerned with the character of the. prohibited restraints
and with their effect on interstate commerce. It draws.
no distinction between the restraints effected by violence
and those achieved by peaceful but oftentimes quite as
effective means. Restraints not within the Act, when
achieved by peaceful means, are not brought within its
sweep merely because, without other differences, they are
attended by violence.

"It is said to be anomalous to hold employers subject to the Labor

Act because their unfair practices would prevent the shipment of
their goods in interstate commerce, and at the same time to hold
the activities of employees which amount to a "direct and intentional
obstruction" to interstate movement of goods, not to be within the
meaning of "restraint of trade or commerce," under the Sherman

Act. If any other answer than a comparison of the legislative history
and objectives of the two acts, and our decisions under them, were
needed, it seems obvious'that the Sherman Act cannot be said to
subject employees to a liability which it does not impose on employers or others.

Mm CHIEF JUSTIcE HUGHES, dissenting:
The undisputed facts will bear a brief repetition, for
upon an appreciation of their true import hinges the
application of the Sherman Act.
As the Circuit Court of Appeals said, the evidence disclosed a "sit-down strike in its most aggravated and illegal
form." When the Union demanded a closed shop agreement and, on its refusal, declared the strike, only eight of
the Company's twenty-five hundred employees were
members of the Union. The Company's plant was seized
and held' for several weeks. Its machinery and equipment were "wantonly demolished or damaged to the
extent of many thousands of dollars."
There was not merely a stoppage of production, but
there was also a deliberate prevention of the shipment
of finished goods to customers outside the State. This
.was not simply the result of the.occupation of the plant
but was due to the repeated and explicit refusals of the
Union to permit the shipment. These goods amounted
to 134,000 dozens of finished hosiery, of the value of about
$800,000, of which 80 per cent, as respondents well know,
were ready for shipment in interstate commerce. The
evidence is that the Company's representative thus besought the Union's president: "We have orders on hand
from customers all over the country which we can fill withmerchandise which we have on hand at the plant. Will
you permit us to go into the plant for the sole purpose of
removing that "finished merchandise'so that we can ship
it against orders?" The Union's president emphatically
answered: "No, not until this strike is settled."
There was thus a direct and intentional prevention of
interstate commerce in the furtherance of gn illegal conspiracy. This, I take it, the opinion of the Court concedes. Whatever vistas of new uncertainties in the application of the Sherman Act the present decision may open,

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.

HUGHES,

C. J., dissenting.

it seems to be definitely determined that a conspiracy
of workers, or for that matter of others, to obstruct orprevent the shipment or delivery of goods in interstate commerce to fill orders of the customers of a manufacturer or
dealer is not a violation of the Sherman Act. With that
conclusion I cannot agree.
The argument has been pressed in this case, and in
other recent cases, that the Sherman Act does not aply
to labor unions. The Court finds that argument untenable, referring to our decisions to the contrary and to the
failure of repeated attempts to persuade Congress to exclude labor organizitions from the operation of the Act.
Respondents' .argument for immunity under the terms
of §§ 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act 1 has also been found
unavailing. Section 6 declares that "the labor of a human being is not. a commodity or article of commerce"
and that nothing in the anti-trust laws shall be construed
to forbid the existence and operation of labor organizations instituted for the purpose of mutual help, "or to
forbid or restraln individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects
thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members
thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations
or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the anti-trust
laws." The reference in the last clausm to "such organizations" has manifest reference to what precedes, and the
immunity conferred is only writh respect to the "lawfully
carrying out" of their "legitimate objects." Section 20
forbids the granting of injunctions prohibiting persons
"singly or in concert" from "terminating any relation of
employment," or from engaging in described activities
of persuasion, etc., when these are "peaceful and lawful";
or "from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and

for lawful purposes.' The inapplicability of these provisions is apparent.,
But while the Clayton Act does not give the immunity
desired by respondents, and labor unions are found by
the C6urt to be within the purview of the Sherman Act
"to some extent and in some circumstances," the Act is
construed as not embracing the direct and deliberate
interference with interstate commerce that is here disclosed. I think that this. construction of the statute is
too.narrow.
Section one of the Sherman Act 2 condemns as illegal
every "combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 'commerce among the
several States, or with foreign nations." "Conspiracy"
is a familiar term of art and means a combination of
.two or more persons by concerted action to accomplish
an unlawful purpose, or some purpose not in itself unlawful by unlawful means. There was plainly a conspiracy here. To "restrain" is to hold back, repress,
obstruct,-to hinder from liberty of action. Manifestly
there was restraint in this case. What then is the significance of the term "commerce" as used in the Act?
Adopting the language of the Constitution, Congress evidently used the term in its constitutional sense. "Commerce" is intercourse; -in its most limited meaning it
embraces traffic. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189.
"Commerce" manifestly covers the shipment and transportation of commodities across state lines to execute
contracts of sale. The term "commerce," we said in Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 46, "embraces commercial intercourse in 'all its branches,
including transportation of passengers and property by
common carriers whether carried on by water. or by
land."

HU7GHES, C. J., dissenting.

As the instant case falls directly within the language
of the Sherman Act in its natural import, the question
is whether that language has been, or should- be, so narrowed by judicial construction as to exclude from its
application the conspiracy and restraint here found. The
scope of this question is not only limited by the conclusion of the Court that labor unions are not excepted from
the Act but also by the Court's rejection of the bases
of the decision of the court below. Thus the immediacy
of the effect of respondents' action upon interstate commerce is admitted and'the argument that the interdicted
shipments constituted but a small part of the "total
national output in the industry" is dismissed as irrelevant.
Tliis rUling necessarily follows from the reasoning of
our decisions under the-National Labor Relations Act.
In Labor Board .v. Fainblatt, 306 U. S. 601, 606, we said
that "The* exercise of Congressional power under the
Sherman Act . . has never been thought to be consti;
tutionally restricted because in any particular case the
volume of the commerce affected may be small." Here,
the volume affected was very substantial although it was
.but a small proportion of the entire traffic in similar.
commodities. Again, the Court rejects the conclusion of
the court below that the evidence did not sustain a
finding that respondents intended to prevent the shipment of the goods. The contrary, as.we have seen, was
clearly shown.
Nor does the "rule of reason" aid respondents.3 The
test of reasonableness under that rule is the effect of the
agreement or combination, not the-motives which inspire
it. Leaders of industry have been taught in striking
fashion that when the Court finds that they have combined to impose a direct restraint upon interstate com2

merce, their benevolent purposes to promote the interest
of the industry, or to rescue it from a distressful condition, will not save them even from criminal prosecution
for violation of the Sherman Act. See United States v.
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., ante, p. 150. If labor unions are
not excepted from the Act, and they have acted outside
the legitimate field contemplated by the Clayton Act,
the impartial enforcement of the law would seem to require that the same doctrine be applied to them. In that
view, the purpose of respondents to promote the interests
of labor organization cannot be deemed to justify the
direct and intentional restraint they imposed upon interstate commerce. The opinion of the Court does not appear'to hold otherwise. From no point of view, as it
seems to me, can the restraint be regarded as reasonable.
Why then should the Sherman Act; be construed to be
inapplicable? It is said that the Act was not aimed at
"policing" interstate transportation. But this would
seem to be a statement of result rather than a justification for reaching it. If "policing" means the protection
of interstate transportation from unlawful conspiracies to
restrain it, it would seem that the Sherman Act provides
* that protection. The fact that various statutes have
been passed by Congress to prevent the transportation of
articles deemed to be injurious does not indicate the contrary, for these are statutes restricting the right of transportation in order to protect the public, while the
Sherman Act is aimed at securing the freedom of transportation in lawful commerce.
The question whether a. conspiracy to prevent transportation in interstate commerce was within the Sherman
Act came before the circuit courts not long after the Act
was passed. In United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, 54 F. 994, it appeared that in consequence
of a difference between the warehousemen in New Orleans and their employ.ees and the princilal draymen and

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

HUGHES, C. J., dissenting.

their subordinates, a strike was called by labor associations which enforced "a discontinuance of labor in all
kinds of business, including the business of transportation
of goods and merchandise which were in transit through
the City of New Orleans, from state to state, and to and
from foreign countries." By thc intended effect of the
defendants' actions, "not a bale ol goods constituting the
commerce of the country could be moved." District
Judge Billings, sitting in the Circuit Court, concluded
that there was no question "but that the combination of
the defendants was in restraint of commerce" and hence
a violation of the Sherman Act. Id., pp. 999, 1000. An
injunction was granted and the order,was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 57 F. 85.
A similar view was apparently entertained 'by Circuit
Judge. Taft and Circuit Judge Lurton. See Thomas v.
Cincinnati,N. 0. & T.,P. Ry. Co., 62 F. 803, 821. It was
noted in that case that a cofispiracy to prevent transportation might result in the paralysis of interstate commerce.
Id., p. 822.
In the case of United States v. Debs, 64.F. 724, the
United States brought suit to enjoin those engaged in a
conspiracy to interfere with transp6rtation upon several
railroads, and an injunction having been issued and disobeyed, contempt proceedings were instituted. The
question was whether the federal court had jurisdiction
to issue the injunction. Circuit Judge Woods found that
it had and based his decision upon the Sherman Act.
After stating that the original design of the Act to *suppress trusts and monopolies created by contract or combination in the form of trust, which would be of a contractual
character, was adhered to, the courtthought it equally
clear that "a further and more comprehensive purpose"
came to be entertaified and was embodied in the final form
of the enactment. The Act extended to conspiracies in
the sense of the law and, citing the decisions showing the

520

constitutional scope of the term "commerce" and its
application to transportation, the court found no reason
for thinking that the term as used in the Sherman Act was
"less comprehensive." Id., pp. 747-751.
It is true that when the Debs case came to this Court on
a petition for habeas corpus, the decision sustaining the
jurisdiction of the federal court to entertain the suit by
the United States was placed upon the ground that the
United States, having -the full attributes of sovereignty
within the limits of its granted powers, had among those
the power over interstate commerce and over the transmission of the mails and was entitled to rembve everything
put upon highways, natural or artificial, to obstruct the
passage of ihterstate commerce or the carrying of the mails.
158 U. S. 564. But while the Court chose that broad
.ground for sustaining jurisdiction, it was careful not to
intimate disagreement with the basis of the decision in
the Circuit Court as to the application of the Sherman
Act. Referring to that decision, and to the Sherman
Act, the Court said: "We enter into no examination of the
act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209, upon which the
Circuit Court relied mainly to sustain its jurisdiction. It
must not be understood from this that we dissent from
the conclusions of that court in reference to the scope of
the act, but simply that we prefer to rest our judgment
on the broader ground which has been discussed in this
opinion, believing it of importance that the principles
underlying it should be fully stated and.affirmed." Id.,
p. 600.
-In-Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, in holding that the
Sherman Act applied to labor unions, the Court cited
in support of its reasoning -the case of United States v.
Workingmen's Amalgamated Couincil, supra, quoting the
statement of District Judge Billings in describing the
New Orleans conspiracy: "One of the intended results
of their combined action was the forced stagnation of

469

HUGHES, C. J., dissenting.

all the commerce which flowed through New Orleans.
This intent and combined action are none the less unlawful because they included in their scope the paralysis
of all other business within the city as well." That
"forced stagnation" was' the obstruction of interstate
transportation. The Court in the Loewe case also quoted
in full the observation in the Debs case that the Court
.should not be understood as dissenting from the conclusions of the circuit court as to the scope of the Sherman
Act. And this Court, still considering the application of
that Act to labor unions, then quoted what had been
said 'iy Mr. Justice Brewer in the Debs case (supra,
p; 581) -with .respect to obstructions to interstate commerce, as follows: "It is curious to note the fact that in
a large proportion of the cases in respect to interstate
commerce brought to this court the question presented
was of the 'validity of state legislation in its bearings upon
interstate commerce, and the uniform course .of decision
has been to declare that it is not within the competency
of a State to legislate in such a manner as to obstruct
interstate commerce. If a Stat0, with its recognized
powers of sovereignty, is impotent to obstruct interstate
commerce, can it be that any mere voluntary association
of individuals within the limits of that State has a power
which the State itself does not possess?" Loewe v. Lawlor, supra,pp. 303, 304.
In the light of these decisions of the circuit courts and
of the significant and unanimous expressions by this
Court, the argument seems to be untenable that the Sherman Act has been regarded as not extending tjo conspiracies to obstruct or prevent transportation in interstate
or foreign commerce. Qn the contrary, I think tfiat
hitherto it has not been supposed that such conspiracies
lay outside the Act:
With this background we come to the question whether
the application of the Sherman Act in the instant cse,

which would otherwise appear to be required by its comprehensive terms, has been precluded by our decisions in
labor cases. The view is announced that the Sherman
Act was not directed at those restraints which fall short
of any form of market control of a 6ommodity, such as
to monopolize the supply, control its price, or discriminate between its would-be purchasers. That is, in short,
that it does not apply to the direct and intentional obstruction or prevention of the shipment or transportation
of goods to fill the orders of customers in interstate commerce such as we have here. I do not read our decisions
as either requiring or justifying such a judicial limitation
of the provisions of the Act. Rather, I believe, they
point to a contrary conclusion.
While Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, was the case of a boy*cott, the principle applied was not limited to that sort of
restraint but was as broad as the terms of the Act. The
Court not only did not exclude obstruction of interstate
shipments from being regarded as a violation of the statute but drew upon the decisions which had involved such
obstruction to support its general conclusion. The Court
considered the means employed in the Loewe case as constituting a direct restraint, but plainly those means were
iiot deemed to be exclusive of other means including those
which had been employed in the cases which the Court
cited. The same may be said of other boycott cases.
See Duplex Printing Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443; Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stone Cutters Assn.,
274 U. S. 37.
In Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418,
438, the Court, referring to Loewe v. Lawlor, emphasized
the comprehensiveness of the Sherman Act, saying:
"In Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274, the statute was
held to apply to any unlawful combination resulting in
Testraint of interstate commerce. In that case the damages sued for were occasioned by acts which, among other

APEX HOSIERY CO.. v. LEADER.
461

HuGHES,

C. J., dissenting.

things, did include the circulation of advertisements.
But the principle announced by the court was general.
It covered any illegal means by which interstate commerce is restrained, whether by unlawful combinations
of capital, or unlawful combinations of labor; and we
think also whether the restraint be occasioned by unlawful contracts, trusts, pooling arrangements, blacklists,
boycotts, coercion, threats, intimidation, and whether
these be made effective, in whole or in part. by acts:
words or printed matter."
Moreover, of what avail is it to interdict boycotts or to
assure a free market, that is, to-secure freedom in obtaining customers, and yet to leave unprotected the right
to ship goods to the customers who are thus obtained?
Of what. advantage is it to solicit orders freely in interstate-commerce if they cannot be filled? The freedom of
interstate movement-immunity from conspiracies directly to restrain shipment and delivery-lies at the very
base of a free market and the untrammeled making of
sales.
The First Coronado Company case (259 U. S. 344),
chiefly relied upon, does not seem to afford an adequate
basis for the broader ruling now made. That decision
was centered upon the point that production, as such,in that case, coal mining,--was not interstate commerce.
and that obstruction to coal mining through a strike was
not in itself a direct obstruction to interstate commerce.
Id., pp. 407, 408. And it was deemed to be necessary to
go further and find an "intent to injure, obstruct or restrain interstate commerce" in order to bring the case
within the Sherman Act. The evidence was found insufficient to show such an intent. Thus, the Court did
not decide that a direct and intentional obstruction of
interstate commerce was not a violation of the Act. In
the Second Coronado Company case (268 ,U. S. 295).
evidence of that intent was, supplied and the Court ac-

cordingly set aside a judgment in favor of the local union.
It is true that the Court, in dealing with the purpose of
the local union, found that it was to stop the production
of non-union coal, and prevent its shipment to markets of
other States, where by competition it would tend to reduce the price of the commodity and affect injuriously
the maintenance of wages for union labor in competing
mines. But the interstate commerce that was thus found
to be directly and inteitionally obstructed was the shipment of the coal, and whether the purpose was to maintain unionization in other States, or within the same
State, would not seem to be material, so long as the intergtate commerce in either case is directly and intentionally
prevented.
The Court in the Second Coronado Company case not
only decided tjie particular case but laid down the general
principle as follows: "But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is
shown to be to restrain or control the .supply entering
and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in
interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the
Anti-Trust Act." Id., p. 310.. The use of the disjunctive
is significant.
The ruling of the First Coronado Company case as to
a mere stoppage of production, in the absence of proof
of a direct and intentioial .obstruction of interstate commerce, was repeated in the case of United Leather
Workers v. Herkert Ca., 265 U. S. 457. But the dictum
from the opinion in that case, which the Court quotes in
its present opinion, must be read in connection with
what immediately follows where the Court pointed out
that there was no direct interference by the defendants in
the Herkert -case "with the interstate transportation" of
the'gbods of the plaintiff company. _Any doubt as to the
true import of the Coronado and Herkert cases is set at
rest by this'Court's construction of these decisions in the

APEX HOSIERY CO. v. LEADER.
469

HUGHES, C. J.; dissenting.

case of Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeymen Stone
Cutters Assn., supra. There the Court emphasized the
point as to the absence of direct interference with interstate transportation -in the earlier cases, saying (274
U. S: pp. 47, 48) :
"The case, therefore, is controlled, not by United Mine
Workers v. Coronado Co., supra, [259 U. S. 344] and
United Leather Workers v. Herkert, 265 U. S. 457, as respondents contend, but by others presently to be discussed. In the United Leather Workers case, it appeared
that the strikes were leveled only against production,
and that the strikers (p. 471) 'did nothing which in any
way directly interfered with the interstate transportation'
or sales of the complainants' product'; and the decision
rests upon the ground that there was an entire absence
of evidence or circumstances to show that the defendants,
in this conspiracy to coerce complainants, were directing
their scheme against interstate commerce. United Mine
Workers v. Coronado Co., supra, pp. 408-409, is to the
same effect."
And the general-principle set forth in-the Second Coronado Company case, as above quoted, was reiterated.
In Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U. S. 103,
107, there. was no showing of a direct or intentional restraint of interstate commerce. But. in Local 167 v.
United States, 291 U. S.293, the evidence showed a conspiracy "to burden the free movement of live poultry into
the metropolitan area" in New Yoik. The Court said:
"The interference by appellants and others with the unloading, the transportation, the sales by marketmen..to
retailers, the prices charged and the amount of profits
exacted operates substantially and directly to restrain
and burden -the untrammeled shipment and movement
of the poultry while unquestionably it is in interstate
commerce." Id., p. 297. Thus it was "the untrammeled
shipment and movement" which, when found to be di-

rectly and intentionally restrained, was held to constitute
violation of the Sherman Act.
Suppose, for example, there should be a conspiracy
among the teamsters and -truck drivers in New York City
to prevent the hauling of goods and their transportation
in interstate commerce, can it be doubted that the Sherman Act would apply? Would it not be essentially the
same sort of obstruction of interstate commerce as was
found to have been effected in United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, supra, where the transportation of goods in New Orleans in interstate commerce
was tied up? There the defendants paralyzed local business and their object was to benefit themselves in their
dealings with their employers, but to attain that end they
directly and intentionally obstructed the movement of
goods in interstate commerce and thus came within the
interdiction of the Act. The fact that the defendants in
the instant case are not teamsters can make no difference
as it is the direct and intentional prevention of interstate
commerce that turns the scales.
Our decisions have saidmuch of the "free flow" of interstate commerce. What isthis metaphor of an interstate stream protected in its flow by the Sherman Act
but a striking way of describing the movement of goods
by .untrammeled shipments in pursuance of freely
negotiated sales?
It was to protect 1this free movement from being
obstructed by industrial strife through the denial of collective bargaining that Congress passed the National Labor
Relations Act. In sustainMng the validity of that Act we
referred to our decisions with respect to the conduct of
employees engaged in production, summing up the matter
in this way: "'And in the second Coronado case the Court
ruled that while the mere reduction in the supply of an
article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal
or tortious prevention'-of its manufacture or production

HUGHES, C. J., dissenting.

is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that
commerce, nevertheless when the 'intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown
to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving
in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the [Sherman]
Anti-Trust Act."' National Labor Relations Board v.
Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S.1, 40. It is true
that in that case we were considering the power of Congress
over interstate commerce, but we were pointing to the
exercise of that power in the Sherman Act, with respect
to which we had previously said "that Congress meant to
deal comprehensively and effectively with the evils resulting from contracts, combinations and conspiracies in
restraint of trade, and to that end to exercise all the power
it possessed." Atlantic Cleaners& Dyers v. United States,
286 U. S. 427, 435.- That power, and its exercise, should
not be deemed to fall short of the protection of the interstate shipment of goods from conspiracies to impose a
direct restraint upon it.
The attempt in the court below to distinguish between
the use of the word "affect" in the National Labor Relations Act and the word "restraint" in the Sherman Act is
ineffectual as it fails to take note of the fact that the word
"affect" was construed as purporting "to reach only what
may be deemed to burden or obstruct" interstate or foreign
commerce, and hence under the familiar principle "that
acts which directly burden or obstruct interstate or foreign
commerce, or its free flow, are within the reach of the congressional power," the statute was upheld. National
Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,
supra, pp. 31, 32.
The evil sought to be remedied by the National Labor
Relations Act was the interruption of interstate commerce primarily by the prevention of the free shipment
and dplivery of goods in that commerce, and hence it has

been applied to those cases where industries are of such a
charadter that the prohibited unfair labor practices would
naturally have 'the effect of interrupting the movement
of commodities between the States: See, e. g., National
Labor Relations Board v. Fruehauf,, 301 U. S.49, 53, 54;"
National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry
Marks Co., 301 U. S. 58, 72; 73; ,SantaCruz FruitPacking
Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 303 U. S. 453,
468; Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 U. S. 197, 221. In National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt,supra, pp. 605, 606, we found
that "interstate commerce was involved in the transportation of the materials to be processed across state
lines to the factory of respondents and in the transportation of the- finished product to points outside the state
-for distribution to purchasers and ultimate consumers,"
and that "transportation alone across statb lines is com-,
merce within the constitutional control of the National
Government"; and, having said that, we pointed to the
protective exercise of congressional power under the Sherman Act as not in.any way restricted because the volume
of the commerce involved in such transportation was
small. Id.
It would indeed be anomalous if, while employers are
-bound by the Labof Act because their unfair 'labor
practices may lead to conduct which would prevent the
shipment of their goods in interstate commerce, at the
same time the direct and intentional obstructioh or prevention of such shipments by the employees were not
deemed-tote a restraint of interstate commerce under the
broad terms of the Sherman Act.
This Court has never heretofore deeided that a direct
and intentional obstructioi or prevention of the shipmnent of-goods.in interstate commerce was not a violation
nf the Sherman Act.' In my opinion it should not so

decide now.- It finds no warrant for such a decision in
the terms of the statute. I am unable to find any compulsion of judicial decision requiring the Court so to limit
those terms. Restraints may be of various sorts.' Some
may be imposed by employers, others by employees. But
when they are found to be unreasonable and directly
imposed upon interstate commerce, both employers and
employees are subject to the sanctions of the Act.
It is said that such a view would bring practically
every strike in modern industry within the application of
the statute. I do not agree. The right to quit work,
the right peaceably to persuade others to quit work, the
right to proceed by lawful measures within the contemplation of the Clayton Act to attain the legitimate objects
of labor organization, is to my mind quite a different
matter from a conspiracy directly and intentionally to
prevent the shipment of goods in interstate commerce
either by their "ilegalseizure for that purpose, or by the
direct and intentional obstruction of their transportation
or by blocking the highways of interstate intercourse.
Once it is decided, as this Court does decide, that the
Sherman Act does not except labor unions from its purview,-once it is decided, as this Court does decide, that
the conduct here shown is not within the immunity conferred by the Clayton Act,-the Court, as it seems to me,
has no option but to apply the Sherman Act in accordance
with its express provisions.
