DELAWARE RIVER JOINT TOLL BRIDGE

COMMISSION v. COLBURN

Lr AL.-

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS OF
NEW JERSEY.

No. 563. Argued February 26, 1940.-Decided May 27, 1940.
1. The construction of a compact made between two States and sanctioneA by an Act of Congress involves a federal "title, right, privilege.
or immunity" which, when "specially set up and claimed" in a state
court, may be reviewed under § 237 (b) of the Judicial Code.
P. 427.
2. The compact of 1934 between New Jersey and Pennsylvania created
a commission to perform'state'functions, including the location, construction and operation of bridges over the Delaware River; to that
end it authorized the commission to acquire real property by purchase or eminent domain, defining real property as embracing "in-,
terests in land," including "clafimns for damages to real estate," and
provided that, where resort to eminent domain was needful for the
acquisition of such interests, the exercise of the power should be "in
the manner provided" by an Act of New Jersey of April 1, 1912, as
amended. Held:
(1) That, beyond payment for the land or interests therein of the
price agreed upon by the Commission or fixed by proceedings in
eminent- domain, the Compact imposes no obligation on the Commission to compensate for damages inflicted by its acts, but leaves
the Commission .to such liability is is imposed by .the law of the.,
State within which the Commission acts, including the Act-of 1912,
as amended, in so far as the Compact has made that Act applicable.
P. 428.
(2) Under the generally applicable decisions and statirte of New
Jersey the Commission is not liable'to pay such consequential
damages. P. 430.
. (3) The New Jersey statute of 1912,'mentioned in the Compact,.
was by its terms applicable to a commission other than petitioner,
and authorized the former to acquire by a prescribed procedure,
existing bridges by purchase or eminent domain and to determine
"damages for property taken, injured or destroyed." P. 429.
(4) Under the Compact, the New Jersey statute of 1912 is exeluded from the operation of the Compact except as it affords a
manner or procedure for exercising the right of eminent domain,

which is called into operation by the Compact only if the Commission is unable to acquire needed property by purchase and then only
as a means of fixing the compensation which under the Compact the
Commission is required to pay. P. 431.
3. Even though it were intended by the Compact to adopt the
rule of damages prescribed by Art. XVI, § 8 of the Pennsylvania
Constitution (1874), which provides that "Municipal and other
corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking
private property for public use shall i±ake just compensation for
property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements . . .," that section,

as construed by. the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania before the
adoption of the Compact, applies only where there is a taking by
eminent domain, and, in the absence of statute, gives no right of
recovery from a landowner for consequential damages resulting from
structures erected wholly on his own land whether acquired by purchase or by eminent domain. P. 432.

federal statutes, but by the "federal common law."

The Compact did not give respondents a right to consequential damages.
In New Jersey there was and is no constitutional provision for damages for "injury" to property, but there is
a provision only for damages for "taking" (Art. I, § 16).
Under the New Jersey decisions there was no right to
light, air and view over other lands, nor in eminent domain
proceedings was there any right to an award for consequential damages for obstruction of view, limitatioh of
light and air, or from the closing of streets. Barnett v.

property "injured" as well as damages for "taking,"
(Art. 16, § 8).

their Constitution there could be no recovery by adjoining

to the constitutional provision, there was a statute expressly giving a right thereto. In re Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Bridge, 308 Pa. 487; Hoffer v. heading Co., 287
Pa. 120; Westmoreland C,& C. Co. v. PublicService Commission, 294 Pa. 451; PennsylvaniaR. Co. v. Marchant,

Lippincott, 116 Pa. 472; Holmes v. Public Service Cornmission, 79 Pa. Sup. Ct. 381.
In other jurisdictions, even with constitutional provisions similar to. those of Pennsylvania and with statutory
provisions similar to the language of the Compact in question, injuries of the kind here involved were held to be
damnum absque injuria. Cf. Howell v. New York, N. H.
& H. R. Co., 221 Mass. 169; Eachus v. Los Angeles R. Co.,
103 Cal 614, 617.
The "federal common law," uider which the compact
is to be construed, adopts the general common law, Smith
v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465; and in construing the Compact
between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, both of which
are common law' states, the sound and safe principles of
the general common law should be applied.
The Compact should be strictly construed against the
enilargement of the common law principle. Shaw v. Railroad Co., 101 U. S. 557.
The Compact fails to bring to light any intention to
create new, undefined and unlimited rights to 6nsequential damages. The definition in the Compact of the term
"real property" as including "claims for damage. to real
estate" relates only to that which the Bridge Commission
may acquire by purchase or condemnation, and not to
claims against the Commission.
The words "damage to real estate" clearly mean that
when the Bridge Commission acquires real property by
purchase or condemnation, it may also acquire claims fox,
damage to real estate existing in favor of the property
owners and against third parties.

Argument for Respondents.

The 1912 Act, as amended in 1919, only provided for the
acquisition of existing toll bridges and turning of them
into free bridges, and did not contemplate the construction
of new bridges.
Reference in the Compact to the Act of 1912, as
amended, provided only a specific eminent domain
method, and gave no right to consequential damages.
Mr.,Egbert Rosecrans for respondents.
The Court is without jurisdiction because the question
presented for review is the construction of a state -statute.

The meaning and application of, ni interstate compact

The Compact clause does not make the Supreme Court
the final arbiter with respect to the interpretation of
interstate compacts. 34 Yale Law Journal 685, 694--695Virginiav. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503, 519.
This Court in People v. Central Railroad, 12 Wall. 4%5
has held that the adjudication by the highest state court
as to the meaning of an interstate compact does 'not present a federal question. Peoplev. CentralR. Co., 42 N. Y.
283. Cf. Hinderlider v. LaPlata River & Cherry Creek
Ditch Co., 304 U. S. 92.
The cases cited by petitioner do not hold that the
interpretation of an interstate compact standing alone
presents' a federal question. Hinderlider v. LaPlata

310 U. S.

The language of -the statutes creating the bridge commission and granting it the power of eminent domain expressly provides for the allowance of consequential damages. Chapter 297 of the Laws of New Jersey of 1912, as
amended by c. 76 of the Laws of 1919, now Rdvised

PerthAmboy, 9 N. J. Misc. 161.
The Constitution of.Pennsylvania required compensation for property in that State "taken, injured or
destroyed" for public use. Art. 16, § 8.
Under this provision a taking is not a prerequisite to an
award for damages caused by a public improvement. The
provision was intended for the protection of not only the
person whose 'property was taken, but equally for those
who suffered consequential damages by reason of a public
improvement. - PennsylvaniaR. Co. v. Miller, 132 U. S.
75; Chester County v. Brower, 117 Pa. 647; 12 Atl. 577.
The Pennsylvania courts in interpreting statutes similar
to the statutesin question have held that the statutes
create new rights to consequential damages. Distinguishing In re Soldiers andSailorsMemorialBridge,308 Pa. 487;

MR. JusTicil STON' delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question is of the right of respondents to recover
consequential damages to their New Jersey land, due, to
interference with their access to the land and with their
light, air and view caused by petitioner's -construction of
a bridge abutment on adjacent land. The answer turns
on the question whether the Compact of 1934 between
New Jersey and Pennsylvania authorizing the construction
of the bridge and its approaches, excluded the application
to petitioner of a New Jersey statute without which respondents would enjoy no right of recovery under New
Jersey law.
Petitioner, the Bridge Commission; is a "body corporate and politic" created by the Compact adopted by
the legislatures of the two states, N. J. P. L. 1934, Ch.
215 (now N. J. R. S. 1937, .32: 8-1 et seq.)-, 1931 Pa. P. L.

Commission to build bridges across the Delaware River
between the two states, and for that purpose gave the
Commission authority to acquire real property by purchase or by the exercise of eminent domain. The Commission, in the exercise of its authority in construction
of a bridge-between Phillipsburg, New Jersey and Easton,
Pennsylvania, acquired by purchase land in the town of
Phillipsburg, upon which it has located and constructed
a highway approach to the bridge, on an embankment or
abutment leading to the New Jersey end of the bridge.
The property thus acquired- and used includes land adjoining the rear of property owned by respondents, having its front on a public street. The embankment and
the land on which it rests also crosses -certain streets in
the neighborhood not immediately adjacent to respondents' land which have been permanently closed by the
public authorities, in* order to provide for the bridge
approach.
The present suit is a proceeding in mandamus, brought
in the New Jersey Supreme Court to compel the Commission to. take proceedings, which it is alleged are author-:
ized and required by the Compact, to fix and award
compensation to respondents for damages to their land,
suffered by reason of the Commission's action in the
construction of the abutment. The State Supreme Court
sustained the special verdict of a jury which found that
the Commission's action had 'damaged respondents by
depriving them of access to their -land and their enjoyment of light, air and view. The court found as a matter
of law that as the abutment was located wholly on land
acquired by the Commission, and as the streets in the
neighborhood had been closed and grades changed by state
authority, respondents were without right of recovery for
the damages suffered, in the absence of some statute
authorizing recovery. But it found such a statute in

(now N. J. R. S. 1937, 32:9-1 et seq.),owhich it construed
with the Compact as requiring the Commission to compensate for the damages which respondents had suffered.
119 N. J. L. 600; 197 A. 896.
Respondents, being without other adequate legal remedy, the court awarded a peremptory mandamus directing
petitioner to compensate them for the -damage or to take
proceedings for the determination of the amount to be
awarded as compensation pursuant to the provisions of
Article III of the Compact, which it also held required
the proceedings for that purpose to be taken according
to Chapter 297 of P.- L. 1912 as amended by Ch. 76 of
P. L. 1919 (now N. J. R. S. 1937, 32:9-1 et seq.) On
appeal the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals
affirmed on the same grounds as those on which the
Supreme Court rested its decision. 123 N. J. L. 197;
8 A..2d 563. We granted certiorari, 308 U. S. 549, the
questions of the construction of the Compact between
states and of the jurisdiction of this Court being of
public importance.
In People v. Central Railroad, 12 Wall. 455, jurisdiction of this Court to review a judgment of a state court
construing a compact between states was denied on the
ground that the Compact was not a statute of the United
States and that the construction of the Act of Congress
giving consent was in no way drawn in question, nor was
any right set up under it. This decision has long been
doubted, see Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., 304 U. S. 92,
110, note 12, and we now conclude that the construction
of such a compact sanctioned by Congress by virtue of
Article I, § 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution, involves a
federal 'title, right, privilege or immunity" which when
"specially set up and claimed" in a state court may be
reviewed here on certiorari under § 237 (b) of the Judicial
Code, 28 U. S. C. § 344. See Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1;

v. Wise, 153 U. S. 155; Kentucky Union Co. v. Kentucky,
219 U. S. 140, 161; Hinderliderv. La Plata Co., supra.
Hence we address ourselVes to the language of the Compact on which rispondents rely to sustain a right of
recovery .for injury to their lands, for which, apart from
the New, Jersey statute of 1912, -referred to in the Compact, the New Jersey courts have held there is no support
in state law.
The Compact created the Commission as a "public
corporate instrumentality" of the tWo states, to perform
state functions, among others, the location, construction,
operation and maintenance of bridges extending between'
the two states and across a specified section of the Delaware River. To tlis enadit conferred upon the Commission
the power:
"(b) Tosuieandbe sued;
"(h), To enter into contracts;
"(j) To acquire, own, use, lease; operate and dispose
of real property and-interest in real property, and to make
improvements therecn; . .. and
I "(in) To exercise the power of eminent -domain. '
In connection with the acquisition of any -real property
for any author'*ed purpo'se, Article III of the Compact
provides:
"If the commission is unable to agree with the owner
or owners thereof upon terms for the acquisition of any
such real property, in the State of New Jersey, for any
reason whatsoever, then the commission may acquire such
property by the exercise of-the iight of eminent domain,
in the manner provided by an act of the State of New
Jersey, entitled 'An Act authorizing the acquisition and
maintaining by the State of New Jersey, in conjunction
with the State -of Pennsylvania, of toll bridges across
the Delaware River, and providing for free travel across
the same,' approved .the first day of April, one thousand

Opinion of the Court.

nine hundred and twelve (chapter two hundred ninetyseven), and the various acts amendatory thereof and
supplementary thereto relating to the -acquisition of
interstate toll brides over the Delaware River."
Itfurther provides:
"The term 'real property,' as used in this compact,
includes lands, . . . and interests in land, . . . and any

and all things and rights usually included within the
said term, and includes not only -ees simple and absolute but also any and all lesser:iihterests, such as easements, rights of way, uses, leases, licenses, and all other
.incorporeal hereditaments, and every estate, interest or
right, legal or equitable, including terms of years and
liens thereon by*way of judgments, mortgages, or otherwise, and also claims for damage to real estate."
It will be noted that the'effect of these provisions is to
authorize the Commission to acquire "real property" by
purchase or by eminent domain, and that by definition
real property includes "interests in land" which are so
defined as to include "claims for damage to real estate,"
and that, where resort to eminent domain is needful for
the acquisition of such interests, the exercise of that
power is to be "in the manner provided" in the New
Jersey statute of 1912 as amended. By its terms the
Compact confers upon the Commission the power to
acquire the specified interests in land or relating to land,
conditioned upon payment for the interests acquired, an
amount agreed upon or fixed by proceedings in eminent
domain. Beyond this it imposes no duty or obligation
on the Commission to compensate for-damages inflicted
by its. acts, but leaves the Commission subject to such
liability as is imposed by the law of the state withiitwhich
the Commission acts.
The 'New Jersey statute of 1912 which, as prescribed
by Article III of the Compact affords the procedure by
which the Commission is to exercise its power of eminent

430

Opinion of the Court.

310 U. S.

domain, does not enlarge the duties or liability of the
Commission as prescribed by the Compact. The
amended statute of 1912 authorized a state commission,
acting in co~peration with a like commission of Pennsylvania, to acquire the rights, franchises and property of
bridge companies owning and operating existing toll
bridges across the Delaware River within a specified territory and to operate and maintain them as free bridges.
It authorized the Commission to acquire the bridges
by purchase or by eminent domain and for that purpose
"to determine the compensation to' be allowed as of the
time of entry upon the property and taking possession
thereof, for the value of property, franchises, easements
or rights in the two States." It commands that after
view of the premises and hearing, the Commission, in
determining the amount of compensation, "shall estimate
the value of the property taken, including any easement,
rights or franchises incident thereto, as well as the damages for property taken, injured or destroyed, and shall
state to whom the damages are payable."
Respondents insist that this direction that the commission created under the 1912 Act "shall estimate...
damages for property taken, injured or destroyed". is, by
the Compact, made a direction to petitioner for payment
of consequential injuries to property to which the Compact makes no reference. Under the generally applicable
decisions and statutes of New Jersey, as her courts have
held in this case, the Commission is without liability to
pay consequential damages.. But it found a statutory
creation of such liability in the Act of 1912 as amended in
1919. At the time of the adoption of the Compact there
was no statute in New Jersey purporting to impose such
a liability which was on its face applicable to the Commission.. If the Act of 1912 as amended imposed such a
liability, it appeared.to be applicable only to a different
corporate body from petitioner snd then only in the case

DELAWARE RIVER COMM'N v. COLBURN. 431

'pinion of the Court.

of the transfer of ownership of existing toll bridges to the
commission the acquisition of which could inflict no consequential damages. In entering into a compact it was
then competent for the states to provide by its terms the
ectent to which they were to take over and apply to the
new Commission, performing a different function under
different circumstances, the substantive rules governing
compensation upon the acquisition of existing toll bridges
under the 1912 Act. The Compact was explicit in its
specifications of what property interests should be taken
and compensated for, and of the right and authority of
the Commission to acquire them by purchase or by eminent domain. By its silence it left the Commission subject to such liability for consequential damages only as
was imposed by the laws of the state, including the Act
of 1912, except in so far as the Compact restricted the
application of that Act. The Compact was equally explicit in its statement of the effect which was to be given
to the 1912 Act and its amendments.
It is plain that, under the Compact, without reference
to that legislation, the Commission could have acquired
land by purchase and built a bridge upon it without subjecting itself to liability for consequential damages. But
it was necessary that a procedure should be adopted for
the exercise of the power of eminent domain conferred
on the Commission by the Compact and this was done
by the provision of the Compact that "the Commission
may acquire such property by the exercise of the right
of eminent domain, in the manner provided" by the 1912
Act. Under the Compact that Act is given effect only to
the extent that it affords a manner or procedure of exercising the right of eminent domain, which is called into
operation only if. the Commission is unable to acquire
needed property by purchase and then only as a means of
fixing the compensation which, under the Compact, the
Commission is required to pay. The Compact can be given

432

310 U.S.

a more extensive effect only by disregarding its language
and by attributing to its draftsmen an intention to adopt
a rule of damages not generally applicable in the state
and now for the first time adopted by a construction
plainly inapplicable to the acquisition of existing toll
bridges to which the Act of 1912 and its amendments
alone referred.
Only by reading into the words of the Compact such a
strained and unnatural meaning; is it possible to find in
it a modification of the settled law of the state defining
the recoverable damages upon the construction of public
works. Nothing in the- history of the Compact has been
brought to our attention to suggest any reason or purpose for such'modification in the special case of bridges
to be constructed between the two states. Both the New
Jersey courts thought they discerned such a reason in
Article XVI, § 8 of the Pennsylvania constitution of
1874, which provides: "Municipal and other corporations
and individuals invested with the privilege of taking
private property for public use shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or
improvements . . ." .In passing upon this case they
thought that -this provision of the Pennsylvania constitution as construed by two decisions of the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court in 1888 and 1889, Chester County v.
Brower, 117 Pa. 647; 12 A. 577; Appeal of Delaware
County, 119 Pa. 159; 13 A. 62, required compensation for
consequential damages in eminent domain proceedings.
From this they reasoned that by the provisions of the
Compact for the acquisition of property by eminent domain proceedings "in the manner ' provided by the 1912
Act with its stipulation for payment of "damages for
property taken, injured or destroyed" it was intended by
the Compact to make the rule of damage under the Pennsylvania constitution applicable to property similarly ac-

Opinion of the Court.

quired by the Commission in New Jersey. But this reasoning overlooks' the important circumstance that the
Pennsylvania courts have consistently ruled that the constitutional provision is without application where there
is no taking by eminent domain, and that municipal corporations or others, although possessed of the power of
eminent domain, are not liable for consequential damages
inflicted by the erection of structures wholly on their
own land acquired by purchase. Pennsylvania R. Co. v.
Lippincott, 116 Pa.-472; 9 A. 871; Pennsylvania R. Co. v.
Marchant, 119 Pa. 541; 13 A. 690; Hartmanv. Pittsburgh

90 A. 652.
Moreover, in 1928, six years. before the Compact, the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in Westmoreland
Chemical & Color Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 294 Pa.
451; 144 A. 407, departed from its ruling in Chester
County v. Brower, supra, and Appeal of Delaware County,
supra, and has since held that the constitutional provision in the absence of a statute requiring it gives no
right of recovery from a landowner for consequential
damages resulting from structures located wholly on his
own land whether acquired by purchase or eminent domain. Hoffer v. Reading Co., 287 Pa. 120; 134 A. 415;
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Bridge, 308 Pa. 487, 491;
162 A. 309; McGarrity v. Commonwealth, 311 Pa. 436,
439; 166 A. 895.
Even though it be thought that it was intended to
adopt, by the 1912 Act, the then prevailing interpretation
of the Pennsylvania constitutional provision, that fact
could have no force here, both because the constitutional
provision has never been regarded by the Pennsylvania
courts as applicable to the use of land acquired by
purchase and because the Compact by its terms excludes

CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 796. Argued April 29, 30, 1940.-Decided May 27, 1940.
1. A bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to make orders not subject
to collateral attack in a proceeding for an "arrangement" with
unsecured creditors brought by a debtor corporation under Chapter XI of the Chandler Act, although the financial and corporate
setup of the debtor are such that adequate protection and relief
can not be obtained under the limitations of that chapter but
require a reorganization under Chapter X with the special procedure
and safeguards which that chapter affords. 'P. 446.
Chapter X, devised as a substitute for the equity receivership,
is 'Specially adapted to the reorganization of large corporations
whose securities are held by the public, and sets up a special procedure for the protection of .widely scattered security holders and
the public through the intervention of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, while Chapter XI, which is peculiarly adapted to the
speedy composition- of debits of small individual and corporate
businesses, omits the machinery for reorganization set up by Chapter X, and contains no provision for participation by the Commission
in a proceeding under Chapter XI.
2. Chapters X and XI of the Chandler Act, in providing"that a'plau
or arrangement, to warrant 'its confirmation, shall be "fair and
equitable," use those words with the meaning attached to them,
as words of art, in cases of reorganization through equity receiverships or under former § 77B, viz., that, in any plan of corporate
reorganization, creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders
to the full extent of their debts, and that any scaling down of
