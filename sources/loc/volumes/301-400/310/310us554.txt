The question is whether respondent, Dickerson; may
recover a judgment against- the United States upon a
cause of action founded upon § 9 of the Act of June 10,
1922, c. 212, 42 Stat. 625, 629-630.
Section 9 provides that after the 1st of July, 1922,
an enlistment allowance shall be paid "to every honorably

discharged enlisted man ...
who re-enlists within a
period of three months from the date of his discharge.'
Respondent, who was honorably discharged upon the
termination of an enlisted period ending on the 21st of
July, 1938, re-enlisted on the following day, the 22nd,
for a period of three years, but was not paid an enlistment
allowance. He thereupon brought this action in the Court
of Claims. It is conceded that 8 9, if not repealed or
suspended at the date of his re-enlistment, would entitle
him to the sum of seventy-five dollars.
The Government opposed the action before the Court
of Claims on the ground that § 402 of Public Resolution
No. 122, June 21, 1938, c. 554, 52 Stat. 809, 818-819,
suspended the allowance for re-enlistment during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1939. Section 402 contains a
proviso, appended to an appropriation for the Rural
Electrification Administration, that "no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1939, shall be available for the payment" of any enlistment allowance for "re-enlistments
made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, notwithstanding the applicable portions of sections 9 and 10" of
the Act of June 10, 1922.
The Court of Claims entered judgment for respondent
on the ground that § 402, while it restricted the funds available for payment of the allowance, did not suspend or
repeal § 9. 89 Ct. Cls. 520. Because of the importance
of the issue in the administration of the revenues, we
granted certiorari. 309 U. S. 647.
There can be no doubt that Congress coua suspend or
repeal the authorization contained in § 9; and it could
accomplish its purpose by an amendment to an appropriation bill, or otherwise. United States v. Mitchell,

v. United States, 150 U. S. 588, 593; United States v.
Vulte, 233 U. S.509, 515. See United States v. Langston,
118 U. S. 389. The question remains whether it did so
during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1939.
Section 9 remained in full force and effect during the
eleven fiscal years ending on the 30th of June, 1923 to
1933, after which date it was suspended during the ensuing four fiscal years by a provision inserted in various
appropriation acts. Section 18 of the Economy Act of
March 3, 1933, c. 212, 47 Stat. 1489, 1519, provided that
"So much of sections 9 and 10 of the Aet ... approved
June 10, 1922 ... as provides for the payment of enlistment allowances to enlisted men for re-enlistment within
a period of three months from date of discharge is hereby
suspended as to re-enlistments made during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1934." This provision, which concededly
suspended the authorization for the enlistment allowance,
was continued in full force and effect for the fiscal years
ending on the 30th of June, 1935, 1936 and 1937, by its insertion in the Economy Provisions of the Independent
Offices Appropriation Act for the fiscal year 1935 and in
the Treasury-Post Office Appropriation Acts for the fiscal
years 1936 and 1937.'
The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill of May 28,
1937, c. 277, 50 Stat. 213, 232, also contained a provision
affeting the enlistment allowance, but the form of'words
used was changed. That Act as passed by Congress provided that "no part of any appropriation contained in this
or any other Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1938,
shall be available for the payment of enlistment allowance to enlisted men for re-enlistment within a period of
three months from date of discharge as to re-enlistments

made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1938, notwithstanding the applicable provisions of sections 9 and
10 of the Act" approved June 10, 1922. The identical
provision, with the exception of the dates, was appended
as a proviso to § 402 of Public Resolution 122, copied
above, and was made applicable during the fiscal year
ending on the 30th of June, 1939.
The provision inserted in the Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1937 was introduced on the floor of
the Senate as an amendment by Senator Byrnes. In
response to questions concerning the amendment, the
Senator stated (81 Cong. Rec. 4426):
".. . the language of the amendment 'has been carried
ordinarily in the Treasury and Post Office Appropriation
Bill, but was not carried in that appropriation -bill this
year, and is therefore proposed to be included in the bill
now before us.
The effect of it is simply to carry the same limitation that
has been carried for years in the appropriation bills.
Its purpose is to continue the appropriation situation
that has existed for years, so that no bounty shall be paid
for re-enlistment in the military and other uniformed
services."
The amendment was thereupon adopted in the Senate
without recorded opposition, and was sent to conference.
The House managers, in reporting the amendment to the
House, described it as "Continuing during the fiscal year
1938 the suspension of the re-enlistment gratuity for enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and
Coast Guard." 81 Cong. Rec. 5084. The course of the
debate amply discloses that the House regarded the
amendment as continuing during the fiscal year 1938 the
same restriction on the enlistment allowance as the pro-

vision inserted in earlier appropriation' bills. It was
then adopted by the House. 81 Cong. Rec. 5091.
The identical provision (except as to the dates) eventually, appended to § 402 of Public Resolution 122, was
'Mr. Scott., one- of the chief speakers against the amendment,
stated (81 Cong. Rec. 5089): "In 1933 an amendment went into the
Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill taking away or suspending
this re-enlistment bonus. ... The provision was continued by inserting it in the Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill each year
from 1933 until this year. It was in the Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill that was brought into the House for consideration this
year. I raised a point of order against the provision on the ground
it was legislation on an appropriation bill, and that it did not come
under the Holman rule. The Chairman of the Committee sustained
the point of order.
"The bill went to the Senate and the suspension was not placed in
the bill. The second leficiency appropriation bill passed the House
and went over to the Senate. This amendment was placed in there.
It was clearly subject to a point of order in the Senate, but the pcl, t
was not made against it.
"It -now comes back to the House for a separate vote as an
amendment. If we vote for this amendment it means the further
suspension of the re-enlistment bonus to the enlisted personnel of
the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and
Coast Guard."
Mr. Woodrum, who took charge of explaining the Conference Report to the House, stated (81 Cong. Rec. 5090): "In the first place,
I wish to emphasize the fact that the language in the amendment
only'asks to continue this legislation for the fiscal year 1938. ....
We ask in this amendment that during the next fiscal year this reenlistment bonus be not allowed; and I may say, Mr. Speaker, this
is not taking one solitary thing away from any enlisted man in the
Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. He is getting exactly the pay that
was promised him, and every member of the Army, the Navy, and
the Marine Corps who enlisted during the list 3 years enlisted with
the knowledge there was no re-enlistment bonus going to be paid to
him if he did re-enlist.

introduced as an amendment to the 'Second Deficiency
Appropriation Bill for the fiscal year 1938 (H. R. 10851,
75th Cong., 3d Sess.), then pending in the House. 83
Cong. Rec. 8522-8569. A point of order was made against
the amendment on the ground that it was legislation in
an appropriation bill; Representative Woodrum, who had
charge of the amendment, admitted that the point of
order was good, and the Chair sustained it. 83 Cong.
Rec. 8567. The amendment was then offered in the
Senate, where the Presiding Officer also sustained a point
of order that it was legislation in an appropriation bill.'
83 Cong. Rec. 9189.
'Senator Byrnes, who had offered the amendment on behalf of
the Appropriations Committee, then engaged in the following colloquy with Senator Walsh (83 Cong. Rec. 9189-9190):
Mr. BYRS.... . I will say to the Senator from Massachusetts,
in the light of the ruling of the Chair, that before the Congress adjourns I shall certainly make an effort to do something to bring
about a change, so that there will not be dissatisfaction among
the various services. If the bounties were all restored, millions of
dollars would be involved.
Mr. WALSH. Is not the situation that under existing law there is
now an authorization of funds to be paid to those who re-enlist in
the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Public Health Service? Is not
that the situation?
Mr. BYRNES. There is authority to pay the bounty. It has not
been paid for 6 years.
Mr. WALSH. No funds are available.
Mr. BYRNES. No funds are available.
Mr. WALSH. The House Bill did seek to provide funds for reenlistment bounties in the Army. Of course, it would be highly discriminatory to have re-enlistment bounties paid to those who reenlist in the Army, and none paid to those who re-enlist in the other
branches of the military service.
Mr. BYRNES. It would certainly be discriminatory, and cause great
dissatisfaction among the services.
Mr. WALsH. Is the bill now in such shape that no funds are provided for re-enlistment bounties for any branch of the military
service?

The provision was thereafter included by the conference committee as a proviso to § 402 of H. J. Res. 679
(which later became'Pub. Res. No. 122). See 83 Cong.
Rec. 9512, 9677. It was passed by the Senate without
much debate.4 In the House, the debate disclosed that
the amendment had the same purpose and effect as the

provision inserted in the various appropriation bills for
the preceding years. Representative Woodrum, in
presenting the amendment to the House, described it as

follows (83 Cong. Rec. 9677):
".... we are providing a further inhibition for 1 year
against payment of the re-enlistment allowances in the
military and naval services.
Mr. BYRNES. That is correct.Mr. WALSH. What the Senator sought to do was to have Congress
declare as its policy that it did not intend in the future to pay such"
re-enlistment bounties, so as to prevent possible* claims; is not that
true?
Mr. BYRNES. Mr. President, the sole position of the Committee
is that no -funds being provided, we should not leave open the opportunity for numbers of persons to file claims in the Court of
Claims in behalf of men who re-enlist, with the result that a year
from now, or 2 years from now, -some men would receive the reenlistment bounty or some part of it, after the attorneys received
their fees.
Mr. WALSH. I think I understand.
the debate in the Senate was as follows (83 Cong. Rec. 9512): -Mr. WALSH. Mr. President, I understand that the bill as it passed
the House contained a provision for the use of funds from this appropriation for re-enlistments in the Army, and no provisions were
made for the use of any of the appropriation for -the payment of
re-enlistments in -the Navy, the Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard.
M. ADAMS. That is c6rrect.
Mr. WALSH. The" purpose of the amendmient is to eliminate the
provision for payment in case of re-enlistments in the Army because
it is discriminatory against the, other services and civil forces, which
formerly received re-enlistmeht pay and allowances.
is -to pen the way for statuMr. ADA-s. That is cnrrect, and it.

UNITED STATES v. DICKERSON.
554

Opinion of the Court.

"No re-enlistment allowances have been paid for the
past 5 fiscal years in any of the services, and in the absence
of permanent law stopping it, the inhibition has been
shuttled about in economy bills and appropriation bills at
one time or another. We have not paid them for 5 years,
and the latter part of this amendment now before the
House is a Senate amendment which discontinues for
another year the payment of the re-enlistment allowances."
The opponents of the amendment, while questioning its
wisdom, were in general agreement with its sponsors concerning its purpose and effect. 83 Cong. Rec. 9678-9679.
The amendment was then adopted by the House. 83
Cong. Rec. 9679.
We are of opinion that Congress intended in § 402 to
suspend the enlistment allowance authorized by § 9 during
the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1939. The
legislative history, summarized above, discloses that
Congress intended the legislation concerning the allowance
during the fiscal years 1938 and 1939 as a continuation of
the suspension enacted in each of the four preceding years.
The adoption in the act of May 28, 1937, of different
terminology might in other circumstances *indicate an
intent to change the object of the legislation. Compare
Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337; Crawford v. Burke,
195 U. S. 176, 190; Piriev. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 182
U. S. 438, 448. But the drawing of such an. inference is a
workable rule of construction, not an infallible guide to
legisiative intent, and cannot overcome more persuasive
evidence where, as here, it exists. Compare Boston .Sand
& Gravel Co. v. United States, 278 U. S. 41, 48.
The respondent contends that the words of § 402 are
plain and unambiguous and that other aids to construction may not be utilized. It is sufficient answer to deny
that such words when used in an appropriation bill are

words of art or have a settled meaning. See UnitedStates
v. Perry, 50 F. 743, 748 (C. C. A., 8th)2 The very legislative materials which respondent would exclude refute
his assumption. It would be anomalous to close our minds
to persuasive evidence of intention on the ground that
reasonable men could not differ as to the meaning of the
words. Legislative materials may be without probative
value, or contradictory, or ambiguous, it is true, and in such
cases will not be permitted to control the customary
meaning of words or overcome rules of syntax or construction found by experience to be workable; they can scarcely
be deemed to be incompetent or irrelevant. See Boston
Hand & Gravel Co. v. United States, supra, at 48. The
meaning to be ascribed to an Act of Congress can only be
derived from a considered weighing of every relevant aid
to construction2 These lead to the conclusion that the
