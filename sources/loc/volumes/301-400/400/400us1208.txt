OCTOBER TERM, 1970
Opinion in Chambers

400 U. S.

MARCELLO v. UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR. BAIL PENDING APPEAL

Decided September 18, 1970
Since MR. JUSTICa BLACK is not sure that three of his Brethren
will agree with his view that the Government's conduct in this
case raises questions worthy of review, he will take no action
on the application for bail but will refer it to the full Court at its
first meeting in October.

Circuit Justice.
This bail application by Carlos Marcello is the latest
event in a long series of prosecutions of Marcello by
federal authorities. See, e. g., Marcello v. United
States, 196 F. 2d 437 (CA5 1952). All these prosecutions ended in dismissal of charges by the Government or
acquittal except a conviction of illegal transfer of marihuana in 1938 and the present case in which Marcello was
convicted in 1968 of assaulting an FBI agent in violation
of 18 U. S. C. ยง 111. This conviction was affirmed on
appeal, 423 F. 2d 993 (CA5 1970), and this Court denied
certiorari. 398 U. S. 959. In June 1970, Marcello filed
a motion for a new trial, alleging that the Government
suppressed evidence which he was entitled to present to
the jury that convicted him. In August 1970, Marw&io
sought a hearing under 28 U. S. C. ยง 2255 alleging that
the chief Government witness had perjured himself.
Both motions were denied, and Marcello's appeals from
these orders are now pending in the Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit. The Court of Appeals declined to
continue Marcello on bail pending a final disposition of
his appeals. Marcello's claims rest on the following
facts summarized from the record.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK,

MARCELLO v. UNITED STATES

1208

Opinion in Chambers

Shortly before the alleged . assault in 1966 Marcello
was in New York preparing to return to his home in

New Orleans. FBI agents in New York advised agents
in New Orleans that Marcello was scheduled to arrive
at the New Orleans airport on Delta Airlines: at 8:30
p. m. on September 30.1 After' the receipt.'- of this
message, a New Orleans FBI agent teiepnoned the-.Associated Press, the local newspapers, and a local television station and inquired whether they intended to..
cover the arrival of a "prominent person" at the airport.
that evening.2 When the Delta plane arrived, the press โข
swarmed around Marcello. With them were FBI Agent
Collins, who according to the Government's brief and
the Court of Appeals was "posing as a passenger," and
FBI Agent Avignone, carrying a camera. According to
the Court of Appeals:
"This crowd followed Marcello through the airport
and onto the upper ramp outside where Marcello,
angrily and with some profanity, .nquired whether
the photographers had taken enough pictures.
Collins, with arms folded, answered in the negative,
and Marcello retorted: 'Are you looking for frouble?'
which elicited the not unexpedted reply from Collins that 'I can handle trouble.'" United States
v. Marcello, 423 F. 2d. 993, 997.
Marcello's version was that Collins said "I'm always
looking for trouble." I The Court of Appeals continued:
"This exchange had an unsettling effect on Marcello who
took a couple of short jabs at Collins and attempted
to mow him down with a haymaker, which never really
got off the ground because of his brother Joseph's reUnited States v. Marcello, Trial Transcript 1126.

straint." Collins himself testified that if Marcello
touched his body at all, "it was so slight, I did not feel
it."" For this "technical assault," which Collins swore
he did not feel, Marcello was fined $5,000 and sentenced
to two years in prison.
The entire case and circumstances shown by the
record are highly disturbing. At Marcello's trial in
1968 his counsel suggested that Government agents
were themselves responsible for the crowd of newsmen
surrounding Marcello and photographing him at the airport.' Counsel prosecuting Marcello -expressed resentment at the suggestion that the Government had entrapped or provoked him. The Government then denied
that it had any evidence favorable to Marcello: This
denial seems incredible to me in view of the now admitted facts that an agent called the press telling them
of the arrival of a "prominent person" and that prosecuting counsel were informed before trial-of these FBI
contacts with the press.' I have no doubt of the
relevancy of this evidence in the eyes of the jury considering Marcello's defense that the FBI was after him
and had provoked the incident. I have no doubt that
the Government's conduct in this case raises questions
worthy of review. I am not sure, however, that three
of my Brethren will agree. Under these circumstances,
I shall take no action at all on this application but shall
refer it to the full Court at its first meeting October 5.
So ordered."
