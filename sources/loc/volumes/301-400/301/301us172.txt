defendant in other suits than those for patent infringement, but that possibility of benefit does not justify a
departure from the standards of correct pleading. There
is nothing in the Equity Rule which indicates an intention to preserve the anomalous practice of compelling a
plaintiff in a patent suit to allege what he is not required
to prove in order to establish his case.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings
in conformitv with this opinion.
Reversed.

CO. ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 688. Argued April 5, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.
1. An allowance by a state court for legal services in foreclosure proceedings, "to be paid in due course of administration," but without
any direction to pay, remains subject to the control of that court
and becomes subject to the control and revision of the bankruptcy
court in subsequent proceedings under § 77B. P. 173.
2. An order of the bankruptcy court disallowing the fee, is not
appealable under § 25a of the Bankruptcy Act as from a judgment
rejecting a claim, nor under § 24a, as from a determination of a

controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings, but only under
§ 24b, in the discretion of the appellate court. P. 173.

Opinion of the Court.

PER CURIAM.

In a proceeding under § 77 B of the Bankruptcy Act
for the reorganization of the Wilson-Sheridan Hotel
Company, petitioners filed a claim for $1750. The basis
of the claim was a balance alleged to be due pursuant to
an allowance of $2250 by a decree of the state court in
a foreclosure suit antedating the proceedings in the bankruptcy court. That allowance was stated to be for legal
services rendered by petitioners and the amount was "to
be paid in due course of administration." Of this amount
petitioners received $500 under a later order of the state
court, leaving $1750 unpaid. Upon the confirmation of
the plan of reorganization, the District Court reserved
jurisdiction to pass upon the petitioners' claim at the
time of the allowance of fees and expenses; and, on the
subsequent hearing of the application for such allowances
to be charged as costs of administration, the claim was
disallowed. An appeal from the order, not having been
allowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, was dismissed
for the want of jurisdiction. 86 F. (2d) 898. Certiorari
was granted March 1, 1937.
Petitioners urge that the appeal should have been
entertained under § 25a of the Bankruptcy Act as an
appeal from a judgment rejecting a claim of over $500,
or under § 24a as an appeal from a determination of a
controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings. Neither
contention is sound. The allowance by the state court
for legal services fixed an amount but without direction
to pay, and the allowance remained subject to the supervising control of the court until payment was directed.
Compare People v. Illinois State Bank, 312 Ill. 613, 616;
144 N. E. 327; Hume v. Myers, 242 Fed. 827, 830. There
was no finality of action in this respect prior to the proceeding in the bankruptcy court and the allowance was
a purely administrative matter upon which the latter

301 U. S.

court was entitled to pass. The record shows that petitioners' claim was pressed, heard and determined as one
belonging in that category.
The case of Duparquet Co. v. Evans, 297 U. S. 216,
is not in point. There is no question here as to-the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the proceeding
for reorganization. The order was made in the exercise of
the general jurisdiction conferred by § 77 B (a) which
embraced the authority to pass upon fees and expenses incident to administration, including claims such as the
present one for legal services rendered in the prior suit
in the state court. Compare Gross v. Irving Trust Co.,
289 U. S. 342, 345.
Appeal could be taken only under § 24b, in the discretion of the appellate court. See Wingert v. Smead, 70 F.
(2d) 351; In re New York Investors, Inc., 79 F. (2d)
179; Meyer v. Kenmore Hotel Co., 297 U. S. 160, 166.
The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
ALASKA PACKERS ASSN. v. PILLSBURY, DEPUTY
COMMISSIONER, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 558.

Argued March 9, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.

1. The rule of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
which would permit an appeal to be taken in admiralty by simply filing in. the office of the clerk of the. District Court, and
serving on the proctor for the adverse party, a notice of appeal,
is in conflict with § 8 (c) of the Act of February 13, 1925; 28
U. S. C. 230, which, in admiralty-4s in equity cases, requires an
application and judicial allowance. P. 175.
2. A rule of court in conflict with a statute is void. P. 177.
78 F. (2d) 587, reversed.
