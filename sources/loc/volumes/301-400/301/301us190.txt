Fourth. Plaintiff urges that relief should be granted
because the provisions of the statute concerning seizure
and forfeiture of unregistered cosmetics violate the Constitution of Maine. To that claim it is a sufficient answer that if there is a wrongful seizure, it will be of
goods belonging to others. For, as the bill and findings
reveal, no goods of the plaintiff will ever be liable to
seizure, since the plaintiff will have none in Maine. If
under this statute the constitutional rights of others are
violated by an unlawful seizure and forfeiture, they, and
not the plaintiff, must seek the redress. Compare Tyler
v. Judges, 179 U. S. 405, 409, 410; Standard Stock Food

MR. JUSTICE

BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, laid
upon corporations, in addition to the income tax, a war
profits and excess profits tax at very high rates. Because
the profits tax might prove unduly burdensome, Congress
provided by §§ 327 and 328 for a special assessment of
the profits tax by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
under certain circumstances. The question for decision
in this case is whether, when a special assessment has
been made of the profits tax, a court may entertain an
action for refund of an amount paid on the accompanying income tax on the ground that the income was erroneously determined.
Obispo Oil Company brought, in the federal court for
southern California, this action to recover an amount
alleged to have been illegally exacted as income tax for
the year 1920. Upon final assessment, the Commissioner
had assessed its net income for that year at $1,476,330.52.
Under § 236 (b), it was necessary to deduct the profits
tax and other amounts from the net income in order to
determine the amount of the taxable net income. Because the net income of that year included large funds
theretofore long in litigation, the Commissioner made a

special assessment under § 327 (d) to determine the
profits tax.' Where a special assessment is made, § 328
commands that "the tax shall be the amount which bears
the same ratio to the net income of the taxpayer . . . for
the taxable year, as the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a like or similar trade or business,
bears to their average net income . . . for such year."
The Commissioner fixed that ratio as 9.67 per cent; and,
applying it to the Obispo Company's net income of
$1,476,330.52, computed the profits tax at $142,765.73.
When this and other allowable sums were deducted, the
taxable net income was found to be $1,245,430.63.
The statutory tax rate on net income being 10 per
cent., the income tax was determined to be $124,543.06.
The Company paid the income tax so assessed; filed then
a claim for refund thereof, setting up several grounds of
recovery; and, the refund being refuscr:, brought this
suit against the Collector of Internal Revenue for the
Sixth Collection District of California for alleged overpayment. The amended complaint alleged that the sum
had been "illegally exacted from the plaintiff on account
of additional income and profits taxes for the year 1920."
In a trial held in 1931, the District Court held that the
company was entitled to recover the full amount claimed.
48 F. (2d) 872. The Collector appealed to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals; but before the appeal
was determined there, the case was, upon agreement of
the parties, referred back to the District Court for correction, to accord with our decision in North American
Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417, which had
meanwhile been rendered. Then the Ccllector moved in
the District Court for judgment, claiming that the Coin'The amended complaint alleged that §§ 327 and 328 were applied
"due to the abnormality resulting from the inclusion in plaintiff's income for that year [1920] of said impounded funds."

pany was not entitled to recover any part of the sum sued
for; and, specifically, that the court had "no jurisdiction
of the subject matter of this action, the tax sought to be
recovered having been assessed under the special assessment provisions of Sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue
acts of i918 and 1921."
The District Court overruled the Collector's motion to
dismiss; ruled that the net income as determined by the
Commissioner was excessive in the net amount of
$40,102.44; and entered judgment for the Company in the
sum of $4,010.24 with interest and costs. The Company
appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, claiming chiefly
that the 1920 net income should have been reduced by an
additional depletion allowance of $516,598.10. The Collector filed a cross-appeal, claiming, among other things,
that the District Court was without jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the action, "the tax sought to be recovered having been determined and assessed by the Commissi6ner . . . under the special assessment provisions of Sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Acts of 1918
and 1921." The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the
District Court in holding that it had jurisdiction of the
subject matter; but reversed the judgment on the ground
that the assessment had overstated the net income by the
net amount of $556,700.54, so that there should have been
deducted the sum of $516,598.10 for depletion, in addition
to the sum found by the District Court. 85 F. (2d)

profits tax thereunder and of the r'gular income tax are
reviewable by the Board of Tax Appeals. When no
special assessment has been made of the profits tax, an
action will lie to recover an amount erroneously exacted
either for income or for profits taxes. But no court has
power to review the grant or denial of a special assessment or the correctness of the computation made thereon.
Williamsport Wire Rope Co.. v. United States, 277 U. S.
551; Heiner v. Diamond Alkali Co., 288 U. S. 502. The
Company concedes that the amount of the profits taxes,
being the subject of a special assessment under §§ 327
and 328, could not be reviewed by the court; but it insists
that recovery may be had of the sum alleged to have
been erroneously exacted for income tax.
In Heiner v. Diamond Alkali Co., 288 U. S. 502, 503,
where a special assessment had been made of profits taxes
under §§ 327 and 328, the taxpayer sued to recover a part
of the profits tax, alleging error in the determination of
the net income on which it was based. The Circuit Court
of Appeals allowed recovery (60 F. (2d) 505, 513, 514).
We reversed its judgment, holding that the court may not,
in an action for a refund of profits tax, recalculate the taxpayer's net income and recompute the profits tax by,
applying to the corrected net income the ratio fixed by the
Commissioner for the computation of the tax. We did
not pass upon the question whether the same rule should
be applied if the taxpayer seeks a refund of the income
tax because of an alleged error in the computation of the
net income. But the reasoning of the opinion leads to
that conclusion.
The Company insists that, as it would, in view of the
large deductions allowed by the Court of Appeals, be
entitled to a substantial refund even if it were denied
the deduction of the whole of the profits tax from the net
income, Congress could not have intended that the deduc-

tion provision should deprive the courts of jurisdiction to
correct errors in determining the amount of the income
from which the income tax is computed; that Congress
intended to benefit the taxpayer when it directed that
before computing the 10 per cent. income tax the net
income fund should be reduced by deducting the profits
tax therefrom; and that, therefore, it is unreasonable
to adopt a construction of the law under which the
allowance of the profits tax credit would be considered
as so essential an element in the computation of the tax
that the taxpayer would be deprived of all other adjustments in the event there is uncertainty as to the particular items.
By the statute the amount of the income tax payable
is dependent upon the amount of the profits tax; and the
amount of the profits tax is dependent upon the amount
of the income. In order to determine the corporate income tax payable at the statutory rate of 10 per cent., of
the taxable net income, there must first be deducted from
the net income' the amount of the profits tax. § 236 (b).
Thus, to compute the income tax in the case at bar, it
was necessary first to deduct from the net income ascertained as being $1,476,330.52, the profits tax which by
applying, under § 328 (a), the ratio of 9.67 per cent. to
the net income, was determined to be $142,765.73.
A change in the amount of net income to which the rate
was applied would, of course, produce a change in the
amount of the profits tax. Indeed, a different computation of net income might have made it proper to compare the taxpayer with a wholly different group of representative corporations, and hence might have resulted in
the determination of a different rate for the profits tax.
And moreover, the Commissioner, having authority, in his
discretion, to determine whether there should be a special
assessment, might have refused to make one. It is no less

true in the present situation than in Heiner v. Diamond
Alkali Co., supra, 506, that the taxpayer's true net income
is an essential factor in the determination of his liability
under §§ 327 and 328; and it follows that the making of
the special assessment precludes review by a court of the
income tax determined.

BOSEMAN v. CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE
INSURANCE CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 531.

Argued March 4, 5, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.

1. In a suit in a federal court in Texas, brought by an employee

of an oil company upon a policy of group insurance, issued to the
company in Pennsylvania by a Connecticut insurer-it appearing
that the insurer had never executed or delivered any contract of
insurance of any kind in Texas; that none of the negotiations for
the policy had taken place in Texas; that all of the insurer's
dealings in connection with the policy were with the oil company
and not with any of its employees; that the company and the insurer intended the law of Pennsylvania to apply, and the policy
expressly so provided; and that the employee in his application
for the insurance, made to and filed with the oil company, agreed
to be bound by the provisions of the policy-held, that the validity
of a provision of the policy requiring as a condition precedent
to payment, after the termination of employment, of any claim
for permanent total disability incurred during the period of employment, notice within 60 days after the termination of the
employment, was governed by the law of Pennsylvania. Pp. 202,
206.
2. The law of Texas, which forbids notice of less than 90 days as
a condition precedent to suit upon any contract requiring notice,
held not rendered applicable to the policy in question by
(a) The fact that the insurer was authorized to do business
in Texas-it actually had no qualified agents there and had never
executed or delivered any contract of insurance of any kind in that
State. P. 204.
