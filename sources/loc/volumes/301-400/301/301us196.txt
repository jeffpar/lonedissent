BOSEMAN v. CONNECTICUT GENERAL LIFE
INSURANCE CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 531.

Argued March 4, 5, 1937.-Decided April 26, 1937.

1. In a suit in a federal court in Texas, brought by an employee

of an oil company upon a policy of group insurance, issued to the
company in Pennsylvania by a Connecticut insurer-it appearing
that the insurer had never executed or delivered any contract of
insurance of any kind in Texas; that none of the negotiations for
the policy had taken place in Texas; that all of the insurer's
dealings in connection with the policy were with the oil company
and not with any of its employees; that the company and the insurer intended the law of Pennsylvania to apply, and the policy
expressly so provided; and that the employee in his application
for the insurance, made to and filed with the oil company, agreed
to be bound by the provisions of the policy-held, that the validity
of a provision of the policy requiring as a condition precedent
to payment, after the termination of employment, of any claim
for permanent total disability incurred during the period of employment, notice within 60 days after the termination of the
employment, was governed by the law of Pennsylvania. Pp. 202,
206.
2. The law of Texas, which forbids notice of less than 90 days as
a condition precedent to suit upon any contract requiring notice,
held not rendered applicable to the policy in question by
(a) The fact that the insurer was authorized to do business
in Texas-it actually had no qualified agents there and had never
executed or delivered any contract of insurance of any kind in that
State. P. 204.

Opinion of the Court.

(b) The delivery to the employee in Texas of a certificate,
issued by the insurer to the oil company, acknowledging that the
employee was insured under the policy. The certificate was no
part of the contract of insurance. P. 203.
(c) The fact that the employee became one of the insured group
through the execution in Texas of a payroll deduction order approved by the employer, to compensate the employer in part for
its payment of the premium. P. 202.
(d) The acts of the oil company in obtaining the insurance,
receiving applications therefor from its employees, taking payroll
deduction orders, reporting changes in the insured group, paying
premiums, etc.,-all of which were done by the oil company not
as agent of the insurer but for and on behalf of itself and its
employees. P. 204.
(e) Arts. 5054 and 5056, Rev. Civ. Stats. of.Texas-which are
inapplicable to the facts and the question presented in this case.
P. 205.
3. In determining a question as to the construction of an insurance
policy, involving only general law, the federal courts are not bound
to follow the decisions of the courts of the State in which the controversy arises, but may exercise their own independent judgment.

Mr.. Leon P. Howell, with whom Mr. Sterling D. Bennett was on the brief, for petitioner.

Messrs. Wm. Marshall Bullitt and Major T. Bell, with
whom Mr. B. M. Anderson was on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner, a citizen and resident of Texas, brought this

action against respondent, a Connecticut corporation, in

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court,

301 U. S.

a Texas court to recover $4,000 with interest and at-

torney's fees. Respondent removed the case to the
federal court for the eastern district of Texas.
The suit was to recover for permanent total disability
under a policy of group insurance issued in Pennsylvania
by respondent to the Gulf Oil Corporation. It covers
employees of that corporation and its subsidiaries, of
which the Gulf Refining Company is one. Petitioner, an
employee of that company, by that policy was insured in
respect of life and disability. It provides that "no claim
for permanent total disability incurred by any employee
during his period of employment shall be paid after the
termination of such employment unless such employee
gave written notice of such disability to the Company
during the said period of employment or within 60 days
thereafter." That provision is conceded to be valid under
Pennsylvania law. Petitioner failed to give the notice
within the time specified. Article 5546, Revised Civil
Statutes of Texas, declares that no stipulation in a contract requiring notice as a condition precedent to the right
to sue thereon shall be valid unless reasonable. "Any
such stipulation fixing the time within which such notice
shall be given at a less period than ninety days shall be
void . . ."

The district court held the Texas law con-

trolling and refused to give effect to the quoted policy
provision. The Circuit Court 'f Appeals held the Pennsylvania law applicable, the policy provision valid, and
that petitioner, having failed to give the required notice,
was not entitled to recover. 84 F. (2d) 701. The sole
question is whether the Pennsylvania law or the Texas
law governs.
In 1916 petitioner became an employee of the refining
company and thereafter worked for it until October 8,
1932. During parts of that period he was insured by
two group policies issued by defendant to the oil corporation. Both covered employees of the refining com-

pany. One, No. G5039, became effective in 1919; the
2mployer paid the premiums; the employees contributed
nothing. to reimburse the employer or to procure the insurance or to keep the policies in force. The other, No.
G5545, became effective in 1925; employees contributed
part of the premiums thereon. Both terminated at the
bime of the taking effect, April 1, 1932, of the one, No.
G5039R, under which petitioner brought this action.
March 7, 1932, plaintiff made an application under the
last mentioned policy-then in contemplation-for the

amount applicable on and after April 1, 1932, according
to his salary classification and continuous service as provided in the policy. In his application he agreed to be
bound by the rules governing the insurance, authorized
his employer to deduct in advance the proper amount
per month from his pay to cover a part of the premiums
to be paid by the oil corporation to defendant on the
policy to be issued, accepted cancelation of his insurance
and released claims under the earlier policies and, in
lieu of that protect'ion, took the benefits granted by the
new policy. The application was not addressed, made
or sent to defendant. It was delivered to, and became
and remained a part of the permanent records of, the
refining company.
March 15, 1932, the oil corporation made written application, which was signed by it and delivered to defendant
in Peinsylvania, for the policy of insurance, and in the
same instrument asked cancelation of the earlier policies.
It requested that the policy be issued in Pennsylvania and
that it be governed by the laws of that State. Final
agreement between defendant and the oil corporation for
execution and delivery of the policy was reached in Pennsylvania. On or about the same day defendant accepted
the application; it signed the policy in Connecticut and
issued and delivered it to the oil corporation in Pennsylvania. In that state the oil corporation paid the binding

premium required by the policy. None of the negotiations for the policy and no act done for its execution or
delivery took place in Texas or in any State other than
Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
The policy also provides: It is issued for a term of one
year in consideration of the application of the employer,
the payment of a binding premium and of other premiums provided for. Each employee in service April 1,
1932, insured up to that date under policy G5545 becomes
eligible on April 1, 1932. An employee may elect insurance under the policy by completing any form of payroll
deduction order approved by the employer. Each employee electing the insurance before becoming eligible will

be insured automatically on the day he becomes eligible.
On the effective date of the policy and on each annual
renewal date an average annual premium rate will be
established. The employer shall give the insurer notice
of terminations of insurance and additions of employees
becoming eligible. The changes shall be considered as
having taken effect as if notice thereof had been given in
advance. Upon termination of employment of any insured employee his insurance shall be canceled. "The
Company will issue to the Employer for each insured employee an individual certificate. This certificate will in
no way void any of the terms and conditions outlined in
the policy but will show the insurance protection to which
the employee is entitled . . . The policy and the application of the Employer . . . and the applications of the

employees, if any, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties . . . This contract is issued and delivered . . . in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and

is governed by the laws of that Commonwealth."
Defendant was not writing disability, life or group insurance in Texas in 1918, 1925 or 1932, the years respectively in which it issued to the oil corporation the above

Opinion of the Court.

mentioned policies, Nos. G5039, G5545 and G5039R.
March 21, 1932, the Texas Board of Insurance Commissioners issued its certificate authorizing defendant to pursue the business of life, health and accident insurance
within that State for the year ending February 28, 1933.
But since 1917 defendant has not written any contracts
of insurance nor has it had there any agent qualified so
to do. It has no licensed agent, has not qualified to write
insurance contracts in Texas or since 1917 accepted any
application for insurance originating in that State. The
evidence is that respondent "has never written or delivered a contract or policy of insurance of any kind or
character in the State of Texas."
On April 1, 1932, petitioner automatically became insured under the policy. The monthly premium for his
insurance was $3; monthly deductions of $2.40 were made
by the refining company and sent by it to the oil corporation at Pittsburgh. Defendant charged the premiums to
the oil corporation and the latter paid them by check sent
from Pittsburgh todefendant at Hartford.
About May 1, 1932, respondent issued and delivered to
the oil corporation an individual certificate stating that it
was issued pursuant to the policy and that subject to its
terms and conditions petitioner, John Boseman, an employee was insured under Schedule B of the policy. The
certificate contained the above quoted policy provision
requiring notice of disability. The oil corporation sent
the certificate to petitioner's employer and July 20, 1932,
the latter delivered it to petitioner in Texas. The defendant did not deal with the plaintiff or any of the employees
of the refining company with reference to the insurance,
certificates issued under the policy or premiums. All its
dealings were with the oil corporation. Petitioner became
totally disabled prior to termination of his employment
which ended October 8, 1932. His insurance was canceled
as of that date.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.
Opinion of the Court.

301 U. S.

1. The oil corporation and respondent intended, and
the policy definitely declares, that Pennsylvania law
should govern. Undoubtedly, as between employer and
insurer, Pennsylvania law controls.1 "In every forum
a contract is governed by the law with a view to which
it, was made." 2 But the precise issue for decision is
whether, as between petitioner and insurer, the policy
provision requiring notice of claim is governed by Pennsylvania law or Texas law. Petitioner and other insured
employees were not parties to, nor did they have any
voice in, the negotiation or consummation of the contract.
The terms of the policy were settled by the oil corporation and respondent. Eligible employees were given opportunity upon specified conditions to have insurance by
giving payroll deduction orders approved by their employer. The policy did not of itself insure petitioner or
any other person. It merely made available specified
insurance to certain employees. For the payment of
premiums the insurer looked only to the corporation.
The latter, for the benefit of its insured employees, assumed the burden of paying to the insurer premiums to
Which they by the deduction orders had contributed. 3

BOSEMAN v. INSURANCE CO.

Opinion of the Court.

By his application petitioner accepted the provisions of
the policy including the agreement of the oil corporation
and respondent that the policy is governed by Pennsylvania law.
2. Petitioner insists that the delivery of the certificate
in Texas made the law of that State, Art. 5546, applicable. But the certificate is not a part of the contract of,
or necessary to, the insurance.4 It is not included among
the documents declared "to constitute the entire contract of insurance." Petitioner was insured on the taking effect of the policy long before the issue of the certificate. It did not affect any of the terms of the policy.
It was issued to the end that the insured employee should
have the insurer's statement of specified facts in respect of protection to which he had become entitled unded the policy. It served merely as evidence of the
insurance of the employee. Petitioner's rights and respondent's liability would have been the same if the
policy had not provided for issue of the certificate. And
plainly delivery of. the certificate by the refining company to petitioner in Texas has no bearing upon the
question whether Pennsylvania law or Texas law governs in respect of the notice of claim. We are unable
to agree with decisions of the Court of Civil Appeals
of Texas in-cases similar to this that the certificate is
a part of the contract of insurance or that its delivery

is necessary to make the policy effective.' Nor are we
required to follow their construction."
3. In support of his contention that Texas law applies petitioner suggests that the insurer, acting through
the employer as its agent in that, State, solicited and
procured him to take insurance under the policy. There
is no evidence that the insurer expressly authorized the
oil corporation or any of its subsidiaries to act for it in
consummating insurance under the policy. Petitioner's
election and the employer's application for the policy
were made before the Texas Board authorized the insurer to do business in that State. By uncontradicted
evidence it is shown that the insurer did not qualify to
solicit or write insurance or accept any application originating there. Employers regard group insurance not
only as protection at low cost for their employees but
also as advantageous to themselves in that it makes for
loyalty, lessens turn-over and the like.7 When procuring the policy, obtaining applications of employees, taking payroll deduction orders, reporting changes in the
insured group, paying premiums and generally in doing
whatever may serve to obtain and keep the insurance
in force, employers act not as agents of the insurer but

for their employees or for themselves.' And wholly in
accord with that view are the acts done in Texas that
are claimed by petitioner to be attributable to the refining company or its agents. They are: The termination
of the earlier policies; acceptance of petitioner's release
of claims under them and his application under the new
policy by the giving of payroll deduction orders; delivery
of the certificate to petitioner; the forwarding to the
oil corporation of the amounts deducted from his pay
on account of premiums. None of these was done for or
on behalf of the insurer. The undisputed circumstantial
facts require the conclusion that the employer acted not
as agent of the insurer but for and on behalf of petitioner
and other insured employees and in its own interest.'
4. Petitioner cites Arts. 5054 and 5056, Revised Civil
Statutes, as opposed to the lower court's ruling: "If
employes in Texas desire to join in an insurance plan
about to be set up or already in operation in Pennsylvania, and either in person or through their employer
take steps in Pennsylvania to do so, the laws of Texas
do not control it." 'Article 5054 applies only to contracts
of insurance made by an insurance company doing business in Texas.1" The respondent did no business in that
State. 1 Article 5056 merely declares that one who in
Texas does specified things in respect of insurance shall
be held to be the agent of the insurance company for
which the act is done or the risk taken "as far as relates

that article as expounded by the Supreme Court of Texas
(Insurance Co. v. Walker, 94 Tex. 473; 61 S. W. 711)
that has any bearing on the question under consideration. The challenged ruling is sound and well supported
by our decisions. 2
5. The conclusion that Pennsylvania law governs the
policy provision requiring notice of claim is supported
not only by the making and delivery of the contract of
insurance in that State, the declaration in the policy that
Pennsylvania law shall govern and petitioner's acceptance
of the insurance according to the terms of the policy
but also by the purpose of the parties to the contract
that everywhere it shall have the same meaning and
give the same protection and that inequalities and confusion liable to result 13from applications of diverse state
laws shall be avoided.
