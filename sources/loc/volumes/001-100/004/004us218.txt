SUPREME COURT
or

PENNSYLVANIA.

December Term 1800
Hepburn's Lessee versus Levy. (1)

E

JECTMENT, for land in'Lyeoming county. In the charge
to the jury, it was ruled,

By the COURT: In the case of a lost warrant, it may be removed
to other land, provided the removal affects no previous right; and
if it is actually surveyed upon vacant land, returned into the
land office, and there accepted, it becomes an appropriation. If,
however,. any warrant issued, appropriating the land, before miu
actual survey upon the removed warrant, the right of such warrant must be preferred. The fact to be decided in the present
case, therefore, is, whether any warrant, particularly describing
the land in question, was delivered by the defendant to the deputv surveyor, before the survey was made for the plaintiff? A
vague, undescriptive, warrant, wrill not be sufficient to affect the
plaintiff's survey: and, although fraud is said to vitiate every
transaction ; yet, the fraud of the deputy surveyor cannot affect
the rights of the defendant.
