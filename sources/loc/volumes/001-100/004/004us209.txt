fendant's taking and sale. (3)
2d. It has been objected, for the defendants, that the plaintiff
was bound to show, that the distress was made on the premises;
whereas, at least, a part of the goods appears to have been distrained elsewhere. However available this objection might have
been upon a replevin, between the original parties, we do not
think, that.third persons can take advantage of it.
3d. It is urged, that there were a number of young cattle taken
on the distress; and that as these have been fed, and reared, by
the care and cost of Dewees, he had acquired a property in their
increased value. Of the truth and operation of this allegation,
the jury will consider: and, if they are of opinion, that the expense of maintaining, has exceeded a fair compensation for the
use of the cattle, they will make" a reasonable deduction from the
plaintiff's demand.
Verdict for the
plaintiff.

Morris's Lessee versus Neighman. (1)
V7 JECTMENT for land, on the north-west of the rivers Ohio
"J.i and Alleghany, and.Conewango creek.
The plaintiff claimed under a warrant, dated the 4th of M1arch
1793,. on which a survey was executed, of the 12th of November
1794; but he had made no endeavour to settle the land, till .uly
1796..
The defendant claimed as an actual settler, under a settlement
commenced in the year 1796, prior to any attempt by the plaintiff; and upon a presumption, that the plaintiff had incurred an
absolute forfeiture of his rights, by not making a settlement
within two years, from the.date of his warrant, according to the
terms of the act of the 3d of April 1792. 3 State Laws, 209.
Dal. edit.
But by the COURT, in the charge to the jury, two points were,
expressly decided: ist. That the plaintiff did not forfeit his rights,
by not making a settlement within two years from the date of
his warrant. It is notoi'iois, that an Indian war existed from
the year 1790, until general Wayne's treaty, which was made on
the 3d of August 1795, and ratified on the 23d of Decenzber 1795.
The ratification of this treaty is to be considered. as the terminus

frontier of Pennsylvania; and if, after that epoch, actual settlers,

or grantees, persisted in their endeavours to make a settlement,
they would not incur a forfeiture of the land. 2d. That even if
it were a case of forfeiture, no individual could take advantage of
it, by entering on the land: the advantage could only be taken
by the commonwealth, whose officers might, issue new warrants,
in the form prescribed by the act of assembly.

Bell's Lessee versus Levers.

E

JECTMENT, for land in Northampton county. The charge
contained the following points:-

By'the CouRT: 1st. A warrant, which loses its descriptive location, by a prior warrant, may be laid on any vacant land. It
has been the uniform practice of the surveyors so to do; and the
practice has long received the sanction of the land office. 2d. A
deputy surveyor gave an order to his assistant, to execute a survey; and, before it was actually executed, he died; but it was
alleged, that neither the assistant, nor the party, knew of his
death, till after the execution of the survey. The truth of the
allegation should be examined; but, in an old transaction, if the
title depends upon it, the examination should not be very strict;
and every doubt should operate in favour of the validity of the
survey. 3d. This is the case of a lost application; and, in cases
of this kind, above all others, there must be due diligence employed to designate and effectuate the claim: for, if the survey
is made, in a place different from that designated in the application, the land office can have no notice of the fact, until a return is made; and it would be hard, that a subsequent purchaser
without notice, and without the means of obtaining notice, when
he purchases, should be affected by the claim. 4th. In the case of
a warrant, neither the negligence, nor the fraud, of the public
officer, shall work an injury to the party. But if the party assists in committing the fraud, not only the party himself, but
every person claiming under him, or deriving title directly
through him, shall be debarred from taking advantage of the
transaction. 5th. If an application, made and entcred in Augutst
â€¢1-65, is not acted upon till 1773; and a caveat, entered in 1775,

is the first notice of a survey; the lapse of time amounts to a
dereliction of the inceptive right, as the Courts of Pennsylvania
have often decided. (1)
