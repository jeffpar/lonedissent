. CIRE facias on a mortgage. The mortg.ge had not been
recorded, confomamv to the act of asg-mblv; :u'd Lockart

plaintiff must have a verdict; and all the trouble of the jury will
be to calculate the. interest.
Verdict for the plaintiff.

Seagrove versis Redman et a.

T

HE plaintiff resided in the Havanna, and was the agent of
the defendants in fitting out a privateer for them, during
the war. On the trial of this cause, he produced, and swore to
the authenticity of, his book of original entries (some of which
were made in his own hand-writing, and some in the" hand-writing of a clerk) to prove the disbursements for the privateer.
And the COURT admitted the evidence, after opposition, upon
the principle, that as it related to a mercantile transaction, which
took place in a foreign country, a relaxation of the strict rules of
the common law, was reasonable, just, and necessary.
