or

PENNSYLVANIA.

March Term 180 I.
Commonwealth versus Addison.

T

HE attorney-general made a motion, for a rule to show
caie, why an Information should not be granted against
the defendant, the President of the Courts of Common Pleas, in
the fifth circuit; on the affidavit of 7. C. Lucas, an associate
Judge 9f the Court of Common Pleas of Alleghany county, .stat-ing that he had been wilfully prevented by Mr. Addison, from
delivering his sentiments to the grand jury, after Mr. Addison,.as President, had concluded hi charge, &c.
In support of-the motion, the attorney-general cited, 1. Reeves.
Hist. .Eng. Law, 201. c. 4. 2 Ibid..2. 7acob's L. Dict. tit. " Chapitre." 4 B!. Corn; 303. Const. Penn..art. 5. s. 4. 6 Nod. 96."
But,' by the CouRT: We are, unanimously, of opinion, that the
case does not present to our consideration an indictable offence;
and, of course, it is not a case, in which an information ought to
be granted. But we are (with the same unanimity) of.opinion,
that every Judge has a right, and, emphatically, that it is his-duty;
to deliver his sentiments upon every subject that occurs in Court.
We add, so far as the expression of our sense of decorum may
have weight, that we think, it would be indecent and improper,
in any presiding Judge, to attempt to prevent his associates from
the exercise of this right; from the performance of this duty.
Motion refused.
