E COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
1191.

C

Little versus*Dawson et al. Executors of Jones.

ASE for services rendered by 7ane Little, the plaintiff, to
Aquila 7ones, the testator.
The COURT, in the charge to the jury, stated, that it was in
full proof, that the plaintiff had served the testator, with great
diligence, for a period exceeding eleven years, on which two
questions arose: 1st. Was she entitled to any compensation?
2d. Had she received a compensation? As to thefrst, it was
RULED, that if the services were rendered merely in expectation
of a legacy, without any contract, express or implied, but relying,
implicitly, on the testator's generosity, the action could, not be
maintained. The weight of the evidence, however, is that he
promised to take care of her, though he did not say how; that
at one time he offered to marry her; and, at another time, he
said that he would provide for her as a child. As to the second
question, it is merely a matter of fact, on which the jury must
decide.
For the Plainti, Rawle.
For the Defendant, Sergeant and Roberts, who .ited I Vern.
