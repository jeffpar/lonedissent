SUPREME COURT
or

PENNSYLVANIA.

December Term 1796.
Graham versus Bickham.

T

HIS was an action on the case for damages, which were
laid at 1OO00l. in the declaration, founded upon the following agreement, signed by the defendant:
c I do certify, that I have bought of William Graham
c 17,344- dollars, six per cents of the United States, to be
" delivered to me on the 1st of. 7uly next, on my paying to
"him, on or before transferring the same, the sum of 22,318A9
"dollars in specie. And for. the faithful performance of the
" above agreement, I bind myself, my heirs, and executors, in
cc the sum of 10001. lhwftul money of PenAnylvania, to be paid to
" said Graham, or his order, in case the same is not filly con"plied with by me. Philadelphia, 17th .anuary 1792."
On the trial of the cause, a verdict was given, in favour of
the plaintiff, for 1798/. 17s. 7d., subject to the opinion of the
Court, on the question, whether the plaintiff could recover more
than 10001. in an action upon this agreement?
The case was argued by E. Tilghman and Ingersoll, for the
plaintiff, on the position, that unless a certain sum is agreed
by the parties to be paid and received, at all events, as the measure of damages, the plaintiff may waive the penalty of the
agreement, and proceed fbr damages according to the actual injury. 4 Burr. 2228. 2 Atk. 371. 1 H. Black, 232. 1 B. Rep.
395. 373. 2 Atk. 190.
Lewis and 1?awle, for the defendant, insisted, that the contract
ought not to be enforced beyond the meaning and understanding of the parties; which was, obviously, to fix a sum, as the
extent of the defendant's responsibility, in case of a non-compliance

By the COURT: The substance of the agreement between the
parties was, to buy and sell stock. The penalty was merely
superadded as a security for performance; and not as a sum to
be paid and received absolutely in lieu of performance. Theplaintiff is entitled (notwithstanding the penalty) to recover damages, commensurate with the injury suffered by a non-performance. The judgment must, therefore, be rendered in his
favour, for the full amount of the verdict,
