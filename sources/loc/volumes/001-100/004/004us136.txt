Schenkhouse versus Gibbs et aL. (1)
ASE. The facts, on which the present cause depended.
will be found in the report of Ingraham, indorsee, v. Gibb."
et al. 2 DalL. Rep. 134.; and the note annexed to it. Ibid. 1362
The following charge was delivered to the jury.
By the COURT: We are of opinion, that the mode of remitting by a general bill, payable to one merchant, with separate
drafts infavour of each of the other merchants, who are interested in the amount of the bill, is a good and lawful execution of
the trust and authority of a factor, employed by several distinct
and unconnected merchants, resident abroad. No inconvenience
can arise from the transaction, if all the parties are apprised of
the distributive appropriation. It is essential, however, to such a
remittance, that notice should be given to the parties. In the
present case, there is no proof of express notice to the plaintiff;
but this may be supplied by facts, which raise a fair presumption
of the plaintiff's knowledge on the subject: and his delay in protesting and returning the bill, together with the draft on Portener, sent directly by the defendants to him, are facts of that description.
It only remains to observe, that Portencr,the general trustee,
could give no preference to any claimant on the fund; and that
in case of a partial loss, it must have been borne, as a general
averageby all the concerned
V
Verdict for the defendants.
(1) An outline of this ease was annexed in a note to thc case of Inqraham
v. Gibb* et al 2 Dall. Rep. 134.; but it wa.s thought of some importance to :dd
the opinion expressed by the Court on the trial.
