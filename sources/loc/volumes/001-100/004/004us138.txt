April Term 1794,
Boyd's Lessce versus Cowan.
"L JECTMENT, tried at Me.t-Ch. ter, in Chwter county, on

1_ the 22d of October 179S. The jury gave a verdict, in favour
of the plaintiff, for the premises mentioned in th. declaration;
and, also, for 411. 13.s. 4d. damages, being the value of the mesne
profits; subject to the opinion of the Court on a point reserved;
to wit: Whether the mesne profits can be recovered in an ejectment, by way of damages? After argument, when the Judgcs
were about to deliver their opinions, the parties made an amnicable settlement of their dispute: but the general question being
of importance, no excuse will be offered, for inserting here, the
opinion prepared by the Chief Justice.
\'K1EAN, GhifY1stice. In delivering my sentiments upon the
point reserved in this causv, I shall first consider the objections
made to the recovery of the mesne profits, in the action of ejectment; and then, the reasons in favour of such a recovery.
1st. The leading objection (and which at first sight appears the
.trongest) is, that the action of trespass for the mesne profits, is
:lwavs laid with a continuando; thus differing from the form of
the action of ejectment, which alleges only a single act of entry
and ouster. For which 3 Black't. 205. 3 M~ils. 118. 2 Bac. Ab*.
181. and Runnington, 4, 5. 44. and 164.. have been cited.
2d. Special bail can be required in the action of trespass for
the mesne profits, but not in the ejectment. 2 Barns, 59.
3d. If damages are given for the mesne profits in the ejectment, and an action of trespass shall afterwards be brought for
the same cause, the former cannot be pleaded in bar.
4th. The law has been against this practice, and cannot noll
le altered except by the legislature.

Sill. It would be inconvenient to allow the practice.; becapse 1794.
titles are frequently so complicated and difficult, as sufficiently to
command the whole attention of the jury; and it would be too
burthensome to impose upon them, also, the ascertaining the
value of the mesne profits by one verdict.
This is the amount of all that has been, or, I believe, that can
be urged against the measure. My answer to the first objection is.
that I agree that the form of the writ and declaration in an action
of trespass for de mesne profits contains a continuando of the trespass, and that it cannot be changed but by positive law. This prevents the necessity of several actions of trespass, for every several trespass; and unless it is so laid, it no where appearing oin
the record that the trespass was continued for a certain time, it
must be taken by the Court and jury to be for a single act, and
damages can be given for nothing more. But in an ejectment there
is no arrest, no writ, and the form of the charge in the declaration in the King's Bench in England is, " that the defendant en" tered into the tenements, &c. of the plaintiff with force and
arms, &c. and ejected, expelled, and removed him; and him
"being so ejected, expelled and removed, the defendant bath
" hitherto withheld from him, and still doth withhold, the po4" session, &c." )acob's Lazo Dictionary, title Ejectment, 1 vol.
Attorney's Practice in K. B. page 424. 4-1.0. Lill. Ent. 192. 205.
Besides, it sufficiemtly appears on the whole record in the ejectment, that the plaintiff was in possession, that the defendant ousted him on a certain day, and detained the possession until the
trial; so that the action is not for a single act of trespass; and,
therefore, the jury may well give damages for the whole time
the wrong continued. At all events, the precedent may be so
nade, in the Common Pleas, as well as in the Supreme Court.
With respect to the second objection, that special bail can be
required iq the action of trespass for thr mesne profits, but not
in the ejectment: it is true, that, upon affidavit, the Court of
Common Pleas in England has ruled special bail in the action of
trespass for mesne profits, though it has been held otherwise in
the King's Bench. Register of Conimon I'leas, 62. However,
there appears to be no weight inthis, wlhen it is considered, that
this action is brought after the ejectment is determined, so that the
plaintiff is in no worse condition (although he has no special bail
in the ejectment) on that account, but rather a better; for, if the
value of the mesne profits is recovered in the ejectment, he may
have afieriftchs for them immediately. If, too, the defendant
should, before execution executed, withdraw his person and effects from the jiurisdiction of the Court, the plaintiff would still
be left in a better situation; for, if he pursues the defetidant, he
may arrest him in an action of debt on the judgment in ny of
the United States; whereas, in such a case, no action of tresimas%
for the mesne profits could be brought (it being a local action)
in a foreign country, and bail demandt-d.

In answer to the third, I will only mention, that nothing ap.
L-r-- pears plainer, than that the defendant may plead the recovery of
the damages in the ejectment; with an averment that they were
given for the mesne profits, in bar of the action of trespass.

The fourth objection, that this Court cannot alter the law, is
correct beyond controversy; but there is no positive law respecting this action, or directing that the mesne profits shall not be
recovered in it, as well as possession; and the Court can alter
the practice, and institute any rules in an action of ejectment,
which they may deem beneficial, or for the furtherance of justice,
without legislative aid.
An ejectment is the creature of TfWestminster Hall, and has been
gradually moulded into a course of practice by the rules of the
Courts. It is in form a fiction; in substance, an action invented
for the speedy trial of titles to the possession oi lands. For a
long time, damages only could be recovered in this action, the
i-easure of which was always the mesne profits. 3 Wvils. 118.
120. In the 14 H. 7., and not before, the term or thing as well
as damages were allowed to be recovered. At first there was a
lease reallvy sealed on the land, and the action was against the
real tenant in possession. It came in place of the assize, in which
action the possession, as well as the mesne profits, was recoverable. Afterwards, casual ejectors were set up; and notice ordered to be given to the tenant in possession. Then the new practice was invented by Chief Justice Rolles. Not very long ago
(in 1751) it was ruled in the Common Pleas, that if after a re-

covery in ejectment against the defendant, he should bring a writ
of error, he should give bail to the plaintiff in a sum equal to
the value of at least two years mesne profits. 2 Barn's Notes, 86.
Many other alterations have taken place; and the same authority
which brought it thus far, may certainly carry it to a higher degree of perfection, as experience happens to show inconveniences,
or defects. Being under the controul of the Court, it may be
modelled so as to answer, in the best manner, every end of justice and convenience. 3 Burr. 1292. 1295. 3 Blackst. Com. 205.

2 Burr. 660. Besides, by the 6th section of the act of assembly,
intidled, "A-n act for the more speedy and effectual administra,C tion of justice," it is declared and enacted, that "tie justices

"of the Supreme Court have full power and authority to make
ti such rules for the regulating the practice of the said Court,
and expediting the determination of suits, as they in their dis"cretion shall judge necessary.". Of the power of the Court,
therefore, in this'particular, I entertain no doubt.
I shall now, briefly, consider the argumentum ab inconvententz; which refers but to a single instance; to wit, the difficulty
the jury may labour under, in deciding on the titles of the parties to the .possessiDn, and, at the same time, in fixing the value

of the mesne profits, if the verdict shall be for the plaintiff. 1794.
There can be no great hardship in this.

In actions of waste, %-.e-..

dowry, assize, and all others, where the thing itself, as well as
the damages, is recovered, the jury are liable to the same inconvenience: nor can I perceive any great perplexity, that can arise
in determining the rent, or annual vaiue, of a house, or parcel of
land, when complete evidence is given of it.
It appears to me, that the inconvenience, or hardship, is the
other way. After a person has been unlawfully kept out of his
house, or land, for a series of years, and undergone great trouble
and expense, in recovering a judgment for them; to give him
the possession merely, without any satisfaction for the use and
occupation pending the ac-tion, does not seem to be complete
justice. To tell him, "You must sue for the mesne profits in a
"new action, fee counsel, attend the Courts, produce witnesses.
"and have a new trial for the sole purpose of fixing their value'"
is certainly imposhbg an improper burthen upon him, if justice
can be had in a more speedy, cheap, and easy way. Taking a
verdict for the amount of the mesne profits, as well as on the
title in the ejectment, will prevent this circuity, delay, and expense; and I believe it to be equally beneficial for the defendant: for, if on the trial he shows a reasonable ground for controverting the plaintiff's claim, or a specious title in himself, a
jury would be inclined to give but very moderate damages against
him (of which the jury in the action for the mesne profits can
have no consideratiou, as the title cannot in that action be again
gone into) and he would certainly be saved the costs and expenses of the second suit.
It is in argument, in law, and in logic, as it is in nature (deestrzicrio unius, est generatio alterius) that the destruction of an objection, begets a proof. I shall, however, proceed to consider the
arguments and proofs on the other side of the question. This
improvement of the action of ejectment has been suggested by
the Court in the case of Treherner v. Gressinoham. 2 Barn's
Notes, 59. 1 Lill. P. R. 680. Wlitefield's case, Buller'sWisi Prius,
88. There has been no judicial opinion given on this subject, in
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,prior to the revolution, that
I have heard of, unless it was in the case of the Lessee of 7ames
Dixon v. Thomas Hosack tried on the 15th of April 1775, when
41L were awarded for the plaintiff: but such an opinion has been
given in Delawareabove thirty years ago; and the general practice in that state, has been ever since, to take a verdict for the
mesne profits, in the action of ejectment. Nay, my memory does
not ser e me in recollecting a single instance, where an actidn of
trespass, for the mesne profits, has been brought in Delaware,
from the time mentioned; though, without doubt, it might have
been done. There has been no similar precedent in Pennsylvania
since the revolution; but, on the other hand, it has been recommended

1794. mended more than once in the Supreme Court of this state, to
%
take a verdict for the mesne profits in the ejectment: and thu
point now before the Court was argued, and the same case cited,
by Messieurs Tilhman and Sergeant, in the case of WVilliam
Tharpe v. 7ohn Bell, of September term 1787, when judgment
was given in favour of the measure. So, in an ejectment, on the
demise of Yasper 2eates, Esq. and others v. Charles Stewart,
which was tried at NAisi Prius at Chambersburgh, for the county
of Franklin, in 7une 1789, a verdict was taken for 1301. damages
for the mesne profits; and a judgment rendered upon it, for the
plainiff, in bank.
Upon the whole, as it appears, that this Court has the power
of"allowing a verdict to be given for the mesne profits, as damages
in the ejectment; as the judges in England, so late as the year
1742, could see no reason why it'should not be done; as it has
been in use for many years in the state of Delaware,under similar authority, and no inconvenience from the practice has hitherto
been there discovered; as it has .been in precedent in this Court
by judicial decisions; and as it is calculafed, in my judgment,
for the reasons assigned, to answer more fully the ends of justice
and convenience, by avoiding unnecessary delay, a circuity of
action, and a double expense to suitors; 'I still must hold the
opinion, which my former brethren, as well as myself, unanimously, entertained upon the subject. If it shall be thought best
by the Court, that plaintiffs in ejectrnents should in all cases be
turned round to an action of trespass, for recovering the mesne
profits; yet, after what has passed, on former occasions, I conceive it ought not to be the rule in this action; but should be applied only to future cases: because, at the present moment, the
Jaw in Pennsylvania is, that the verdict in this action is regular,
md agreeable to the practice of the Supreme Court. Ea.t bonijudicis ampliarejustitiam.
