SUPREME COURT
or

PENNSYLVANIA.

December Term 1799.
Levy versus Wallis.
N this case a testatum ft. fa. issued on the 27th of December
1798, returnable to A1arch term 1799, which was levied on
twelve horses. A venditioni exPonas issued to September term
1799; and an alias vend. exp. issued to December term 1799.
On the last writ, the sheriff returned, that he had sold the horses
to the amount of 1021 dollars; that Thomas Hamilton had bougilt
seven of the horses for 630 dollars; but that, both before and after
the sale, he had given written notice, that*he claimed the money
arising on the sales, by virtue of a levy previously made for him
upon an execution, by the former sheriff; and that, therefore, he
claimed to retain the amount of his purchases, in part satisfaction of his execution: and the remaining money of the sales
aforesaid, the said sheriff has ready, &c.
From the records, it appeared, that Hamilton had issued a ft.
fa. against TWallis on the 25th of Yanitary, returnable to llarch
term 1798, which was levied (intera/ia) upon seven horses; and
that on the 11th of December 1798, a vend. exp. issued, but was
never prosecuted.
It, also, appeared, that in the case of Pert,executor, v. Mallis, a testatum ft. fa. had issued to March term 1797, which was
levied (inter a/ia) upon seven horses; that a vend. exp. issued;
that an alias vend. exp. issued to Scptember term 1798, on which
the sales were put off at the risque of the plaintiff; and that a
pluries vend. exp. issued to September term 1799.
The general question was, whether the- prior execution creditors, Hamilton and Perit;had not lost their liens, by allowing the
property levied upon, to remain in the hands of the defendant?
The COURT declared, that it had been repeatedly determined,
and was become the settled law of Pennsylvania, that the act of
suffering

suffering goods to remain in the hands of the defendant, after
Sthey were levied upon, furnished no presumption of fraud here,
as it did in England; and that this departure from ihe English
rule arose from sentiments of humanity, and the peculiar necessities of the country. In the interior of the state, particularly, it
was the universal practice not to remove the goods after a levy.
If, however, the intention of leaving them with the defendant
was fraudulent, a subsequent execution would be preferred, in
Pennsylvania, as well as in England. In the present instance,
there is no proof of fraud; the first levies are, of course, good;
and the sheriff must pay the money arising from the sales accordingly. (1) â€¢

judgment for the plaintiff. (1)

Kesselman's Lessee versus Old.

B

Y the statute of 4 Anne, c. 16. s. 21. it is enacted, that "all
" collateral warranties, which shall be made after the first
ic day of Trinity term, of any lands, tenements, or hereditamnents,
" by any ancestor, who has no estate of inheritance in possession
" in the same, shall be void against his heir."
In the present ejectment, the point was, whether the plaintiff
was estopped by a collateral warranty of his ancestor, who had
no estate of inheritance, in possession, of the premises?
After argument, and taking time to deliberate, the opinion of
the COURT was delivered by SIIpIp,, Chief Y'ustiee, that there
was no trace of the extension of the statute of the 4 Anne, c. 16. to
Pennsylvania, by legislative authority, or judicial practice: and,
(1)in Chancellor v. Philips etaL September term 1800, and several other
cases, the law has been stated in a similar manner. But in the case of the
v. Cunninghant, in the Circuit Court, belbre ffudges TILoGuNAJ~,

and

the same subject was fully discussed; and the

Court adhered to the common law rule., notwithstanding the decisions in
Pennsylvania.
(2) M'KEAx, G0.Y., presided at the argument of the cause; but, being
clected governor of the commonwealth, in October 1799, he took no part in the
decision. He informed the Reporter, however, that his opinion was decidedly
in favour of the defendant.
