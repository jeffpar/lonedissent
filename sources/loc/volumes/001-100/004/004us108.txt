CASES RULED AND ADJUDGED, &C.

are not bound, judicially, to noice a right of privilege, nor to
grant it without a claim. In the present instance, neither the defendant, nor his attorney, suggested the privilege, as an objection
to the trial of the cause: and, this amounts to a waiver, by which
the party is forever concluded.
We are, therefore, unanimously of opinion, that the judgment
cannot now be set aside, or opened.

Carson versus Hood's Executors.
4' 1,
7h "721

"-EBT. Plea, nil debet. The principal point in this case was,
D
whether debt would lie against executors, on a simple contract of the testator?
Bradord, for the- plaintiff, stated the rule to be, that if the
executors demur to the action, they are entitled to judgment;
but, if they plead to issue, they cannot, afterwards, make the objection:. and the following authorities were cited to maintain the
distinction. Cro. B. 600. 557. Cro. C. 187. Cro. .E. 121. 1 4nd.
182. Golds. 106. Leon. 165. Vaugh. 99. 1 Sid. 333. Plowd.
Rep. 182. Palm. 32. Cro. E. 435. 459. Telv. 56. 1 Lev. 200.
1 Vent. 139. Vaugh. 97.

The COURT, being unanimously of this opinion, gave judgment,
for the plaintiff: having, on a preliminary point, decided, that
after a verdict, they vilj presume, every thing was done, at the
trial, which was necessay to support the action, unless the contrary appeared upon the record. 3 Burr. 1725. 1729. 1 Wils.
