CASES RULED AND ADJUDGED I, THE

1803.

LThe

Commonwealth versus Baynton et al.

D

EBT, on the official bond of Peter Baynton, as state treasurer, dated the 11th of 7anuary 1797, against him, and
his sureties, David Lenox, Uilliam Hall, and loseph Bulock. It
was admitted, that there was a considerable balance due from
Baynton to the state; but the defence taken for his sureties was
on two distinct grounds: 1st. That the treasurer is elected
anau.li-; he is required to give bond on every election; and
that lus sureties in the present bond, are only liable for any defiit, actually incurred, during the year, commencing in 7anuary
1797, and ending in 7anuary 1798. 2d. That by the conduct of
the legislature, in frequent subsequent re-'ppointments of Baynton, as treasurer; and by the conduct of the accounting officers,
who had the legal examination and controul of his accounts; the
surctie.? were virtually discharged. On thefirst point, were cited,

reference to the Acts of Assembly, and to the public records,
in relation to the state treasurer's accounts, andi to the repeated
elections of Mr. Baynton; and the following authorities were
cited: Co. Litt. 206, 7. 1 Roll. Abr. 457. 4.63. 2 Yez. jui. 540.

On the part of the Connontwealt41, a strict scrutiny was made

into the bank deposits and drafts of Baynton, to ascertain the
period when the deficit arose, and its subsequent fluctuations:
And it was contended, 1st. That from the nature and extent
of the obligation, the sureties were bound to indemnify the
state, unless they could show, that there was an express release; that the recovery was barred by lapse of time; or that
a settlement with the principal, had extinguished the claim
upon the sureties. 2d. That the indemnity of the bond extended to the general duty of the treasurer, as well as to his
fidelity in pecuniary transactions; and as soon as he ceased
to make the bank of Pennsyivania the depositary of the public
m.oney; or as soon as a false estimate of accounts was exhibited;
th6 bond was forfieited. , d. That from the very nature of the inde--nity, its obligation is co-extensive with the continuance of
the person, in the office; and the only questions are, whether the
sureties could so engage? and whether they have so engaged?
r'hat oh the facts (even supposing the indemnity of the bond to
be limited, by an implied connexion with the annual tenure of the
*)qice) there was a defcit of inacti-e public money-, at the end of

The CoUniT, in the charge, directed the jury, in point of law,
to confine the responsibility of the sureties, to a deficit occurring
during the year, ensuing the date of the bond. But if, from the
evidence, they were satisfied, that there was a deficit, during that
year, they thought, that a verdict should be in favour of the
commonwealth for the amount.

America.
HIS was an action on a policy of insurance, in which the
declaration was for a total loss. On the trial, it appeared,
that the assured had demanded payment of a total loss, which
the defendants refused to pay; but there was no evidence of an
actual abandonment, or offer to abandon, to the underwriters, before the suit was instituted; and the proof was of a loss in its
nature total. The jury gave a verdict, in favour of the plaintiff,
finding damages, as for a partial loss; subject to the opinion of
the Court, upon a motion for a new trial, to consider two points
reserved: 1st. Whether a previous abandonment, or offer to
abandon, was indispensably necessary, to enable the plaintiff to
recover in this suit? And, 2d. Whether, on a declaration for a
total loss, and proof of a loss in its nature total, the jury can give
damages for less than a total loss?
After argument bv 31 Levy and Lewis, for the plaintiffs; and
by .Moylan, .E. Tilghnan, and Ingersoll, for the defendants, the
COURT (consisting of SHIPPEN, Chief 7ustice, and YEATES and
SMITH, .7ustices) .were of opinion, that the jury might find
damages for a partial loss; although the declaration claimed for
a total loss; and although there was no proof of an actual abandonment, or an offer to abandon, to the underwriters.

(1) It may be proper to observe, that Mr. Daynton did not appear, no*"
take dcfende, in this suit: the proceedings to recover from him lmving been
.nstituted on the settlement of the comptroller.
