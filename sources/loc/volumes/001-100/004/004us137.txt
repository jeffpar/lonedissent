M'Ewen versus Gibbs et al.

C ASE,
on a parol acceptance of a bill of exchange. The
plaintiff, having become a certificated bankrupt, was called
as a witness to prove the acceptance. Dallas objected to his
competency, on the ground of the witness's liability for costs;
and his interest in augmenting the estate surrendered under his
commission.
But it appearing, that the assignees carried on the suit, and
had entered into security for costs, the COURT (after thc plaintiff
had released his interest at the bar) directed him to be sworn,
upon the authority of Scott v. J'C,'lenachan.
