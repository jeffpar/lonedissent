But, by the COURT: Some of the objections are inqurmount.
able. In the first place, it is not sufficient to state the evidence;
but the magistrate musf go on to declare, that the offence was
committed, and the defendant thereof convicted. Here, neither
the offence, nor the conviction, are to be found in the proceedings. In the next place, we have no statement where the defendant carried on the business of huckster; and it might be where
it was no offence to do so; or where the corporation had no jurisdiction to punish it as an offence. The proceedings are,.
therefore, manifestly erroneous, and must be set aside.

1798, judgment was entered for 8691. 3s. 6d. with costs. A ft.
fa. issued to 7anuary term 1799, for 7661. 9s. 5d. which was
regularly returned, "Staid by order of plaintiff's attorney;" with
an additional indorsement, signed by Black, the defendant below, in these words: "I agree that the sheriff return a levy on
" this writ, as of the term to which it is returnable:" and such a
return was accordingly made, at a subsequent period. On the
18th of .uly 1800, the sheriff held an inquest, by virtue of the
above ft. fa. and returned the inquest annexed to the writ. The
inquest condemned the property; and it was afterwards sold on
a vend. exp. when Wistar became the purchaser.
