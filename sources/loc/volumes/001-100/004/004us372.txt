The United States versus Thomas Passmore.

T

HE defendant, who had become bankrupt, was prosecuted
by indictment, containing two counts, for peijury, in swearing before the commissioners, on the 20th day of September 1803
that he " could not tell exactly the time, but believed it was the
"latter [end] of 1799, that he first owned the brig Abigail. He
"ceased to own her, he iather thought, in the year 1800," when
in truth and in fact he never did own her, but had covered the
property for an alien under his name. He had before sworn, at
the custom-house (on the 31st of .tdy 1799) that he "1was the
" true and only owner of the brig Abigail; that there was no
t subject, nor citizen, of any foreign prince, or state, directly or
c indirectly, by way of trust, confidence, or otherwise, interested
" therein, or in the profits or issues thereof:" but no information, tending to falsify this oath, was received, until, a prosecution was barred by the act of limitation. 1 vol. Acts Cong. p. 113.
s. 32. (1) On the 19th of December 1803 (7 vol. 14) an act of

execution of any commission of bankruptcy, which may have 18o4.
=been issued prior to the passing of this act, but every such
commission shall be proceeded on, and fully executed, as
though this act had not passed."
The facts being laid before the jury, Rawle and Diclerson,
made a defence, principally, upon two grounds: 1st. That the
defendant was not guilty, upon the merits. 2d. That the oath,
charged to be false, was taken before the repeal of the bankrupt
law; and, in consequence of the repeal, could not be the subject
of a prosecution, either under the bankrupt law, under the general penal law, or at common law. (2) On the first ground, they

the perjury charged, was indictable, according to the second
count of the indictment, independent of the bankrupt law, upon
the general penal act (1 vol. 108.) inasmuch as the provisions of
the bankrupt law, do not create the offence; are affirmative and
not repugnant; and, with respect to the punishment, are cumulative. Cowp. 297. 2 Hale, 705. 4 Burr. 2026. 23 Geo. 2.
(2) Before the jury were sworn, ?av le said, that, although he did not mean
to move to quash the indictment, he bihould propose, under the sanction ol
the Court, that the question of law, arising upon the repealing act, should b
discussed, as soon as the jury were sworn, and before any evidence was pro
duced. The attorney of the district objected to the novelty of such a proceed.
ing. And by the Cou~vr: The trial must proceed, in the usual course. Thw
evidence and law must both be laid before the jury, who will then give averdict, under the charge of the Court. If the verdict should be against the dethndant, his counsel may rnove the point of law in arreit 6fjudgment.

WASHINGTON, Yustice, delivered the charge of the Court at
large, upon the points of law; but cautiously abstaint d from
giving any opinion upon the facts. ie considered the repealing
act, as an absolute bar to the prosecution; and told the jury, expressly, that the defendant was, on that ground alone, independent of any question upon the merits, entitled to an acquittal.
On this charge, the july immediately found a verdict of not
guilty.
