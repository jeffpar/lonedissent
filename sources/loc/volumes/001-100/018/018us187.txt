The1 UNITED STATES V. JOHN FURLONO, alias
HOBSON.

Tins was another indictment against the same
prisoner, before the same Court, on the act of the 3d
of March, 1819, c. 76. for the piratical seizure of an
i4nknown vessel. Verdict, guilty. The offence was
committed on a foreign vessel, by a foreigner, from a
vessel of the United States, which had been run away
with by the captain and crew. It was moved by the
prisoner's counsel, that the judgment be arrested on
the ground that, as the constitution of the United
States gives the power to Congress, to define and punish the crime of piracy, it is necessary that Congress
define before it can punish, and that a reference to
the law of nations is not such a definition as the constitution requires. Upon which ground, the Judges
being divided in opinion, upon request of counsel for
prisoner, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the ground of the
defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certified by him, under the seal of the Court, and sent
to this Court for their decision.
