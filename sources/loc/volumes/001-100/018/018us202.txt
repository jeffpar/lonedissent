CASES IN THE SUPR1EME COURT

V.

proper to remark, that in Klintock's case it has been
decided, that a belligerent character may be put off,
and a piratical one assumed, even under the most unquestionable commission. And if
the laws of the
United States declare those acts piracy in a citizen,
when committed on a citizen, which would be only
belligerent acts when committed on others, there can
be no reason why such laws should not be enforced.
For this purpose the 9th section of the act of 1790
appears to have been passed. And it would be difficult to induce this Court to render null the provisions
of that clause, by deciding either that one who takes
a commission under a foreign power, can no longer be
,deemed a citizen, or that all acts committed under
such a commission, must be adjudged belligerent, and
not piratical acts.
The UNITED STATES V. JOHN FURLONG, alias
JOHN HoBsoN.
CERTIMcATE.-This cause came on to be heard
on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Georgia, and
on the question on which the Judges of that Court
were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel.
On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion,
that the 8th section of the act of the 30th of April,
1790, on which the indictment is founded, is not repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819, entitled, ," an act to protect the commerce of the
United States, and to punish the crime of piracy."
