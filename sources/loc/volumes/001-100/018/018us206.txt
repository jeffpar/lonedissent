HENRY MATHEWS.

CERTIFICATE.-This cause came on to be

heard

on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Georgia, and
on the questions on which the Judges of that Court
were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel.

On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion,
1. That it is competent to prove the national character of an American vessel without evidence of her
register.
2. That it is competent for the jury to find that
the piracy was committed on the high seas, upon evidence that the Asia, at the time she was boarded, was
at anchor in an open roadstead at the island of Bonavista.

3. That the 8th section of the act of the 30th of
April, 1790, entitled, &c. is not repealed by the 8th
section of the act of March 3, 1819, entitled, &c.

4. That each count in an indictment is a substantive charge, and if the finding conform to any one of
them which in itself will support the verdict, it is
sufficient to givejudgment.
