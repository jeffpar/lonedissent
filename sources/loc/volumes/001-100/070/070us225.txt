crowding sail and running in toward the blockaded port.
The excuse set up of a desire to save his vessel and cargo
without subjecting her to salvage, would not be sufficient if
the case stood alone on the facts connected with her voyage
from Port Royal. In the language of Sir William Scott, in
Thte Charlotte ChriMtine,* although "it is a possible thing that
his intention was innocent, the court is under the necessity
of acting on the presumption which arises from such conduct, and of inferring a criminal intention." But when
these are considered in connection with the facts already
stated, tending to show an intention to run the blockade
from the inception of the adventure, we entertain no reasonable doubt of the guilty purpose which carried her into
Bull's Bay at the time of capture. Of course the attempt to
violate the blockade was made in the interest of the cargo.
DECREE AFFIRMED.

THE CONVOY'S 'WHEAT.
1. Where a bill of lading, signed by a master, shows that a voyage to a
particular place named on it is but part of a longer transit which it is
understood is to be made by the cargo shipped, and that the cargo is to
be carried forward in a continuous way on its further voyage, the master
must be presumed to have contracted in reference to the course of trade
connected with getting the cargo forward.
2. In such a case, if any obstacle should intervene, which by the regular
course of the trade is liable to, occur and for a short time retard the
forwarding, the master cannot, from a mere inability to find storage at
the entrepOt, turn about, and taking the cargo to some near port, storq
it there, inform the consignees, and clear out. He should wait.
8. If there is easy telegraphic communication with the consignees, he
should notify to them his difficulty, that they may send him, if they
please, instructions.

of wheat. The master executed a bill of lading for it, which
ran thus:
"Shipped in good order, &c., &c., to be delivered unto con
signee, as per margin. Freight and charges to be paid as noted
below, upon the actual and complete delivery of the said goods
and freight to said consignee, or their assigns."
On the margin below was entered:
"Acct. Carrington & Preston, Oswego, N. Y., via Welland Railway from
Port Colbourne to Port Dalhousie, thence by sail or steam to Oswego.
Freightto Port Collourne, 8j cents per bushel."

The reader will understand, of course, that the wheat was
to be carried by the Convoy from Chicago, by the lakes, to
Port Colbourne, at the eastern extremity of Lake Erie;
that there it was to be unladed, and carried by the Welland
Railway across the Canadian isthmus to Port Dalhousie, on

through the Welland Canal.

THE CONVOY'S WHEAT.
Argument for the appelIants.

Parol testimony from Wolcot, the agent of the shippers,
went to show, specifically, that the contract made by the
master of the Convoy had been to carry the wheat to Port
Colbourne only; and that he, Wolcot, had made a separate
contract with the Wellaid Railway Company "to take it from
there through to Oswego." The vessel agent at Chicago,
one Goodenow, who filled the blanks in the Convoy's bills
of lading and made the entries on the margin, testified to a
similar effect; he swearing, moreover, that the expression,
"via 'Welland Railway," entered on the margin, was construed by him as having the same meaning as "care of the
Welland Railway."
The Convoy having arrived at Port Colbourne on the 29th
of August, 1860, the master reported her to the Welland
Railway Company, and informed the agents having charge
of the railway and the elevator there that he was ready to
discharge his cargo. There were then thirteen vessels in
the port with cargoes to discharge, which had arrived before
the Convoy; and the agents replied that they would discharge the Convoy's cargo in its turn. The master made a
similar application on the morning of the 30th of August,
and received answer as on the morning previous. There
being no elevator but the one at Port Colbourne, and no
warehouse or place where the wheat could be stored, the
Convoy left Port Colbourne on the 30th of August, and
went to the city of Buffalo, the nearest port to Port Cblbourne.
On the 31st of August she discharged her cargo in that city,
and the master stored it at the Hatch elevator there, taking
a receipt for its delivery to his order. On the next day,
which was Sunday, he sailed for Chicago; and the owner of
the Convoy telegraphed thus from Buffalo to Carrington &
Preston, the consignees at Oswego:
"Obliged to store cargo Convoy in the Hatch elevator, in this
city; siall libel cargo for freight and demurrage at Port Colbourne, and freights and charges here, unless settled immediately."
This telegram was the first and only information sent to

the consignees relative to the cargo. There was a telegraphic
communication between -PortColbourne and Oswego.
Carrington & Preston, feeling themselves aggrieved by
proceedings which they regarded as somewhat summary,
declined to settle the account so immediately as invited;
and the ship-owner libelled the wheat in the District Court
for the Northern District of New York, for freight and
damages, in the nature of demurrage.
It appeared that if the Convoy had remained at Port Colbourne she would have heen unladed on the 4th of September, in her regular order; that the railway company did
everything in their power to despatch business, and discharged cargoes as fast as the capacity of their elevator
and road would permit;- and that, at this time, an unusual
number of vessels had arrived, and that there was an unusual amount of grain to be handled on the road and at the
elevator.
The District Court dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court
affirmed its decree. Appeal here.
Mr. Hibbard,for the appellants, owners of the Convoy: By
the entries on the margin of the bill of lading, taken in
connection with Goodenow's explanation of the word via,
with the circumstances of the case, and especially the size
of the vessel, which could not pass through the Welland
Canal, it appears that the contract was to carry to Port Colbourne, and that there the ship-owner should be entitled to
receive freight. The freight was to be paid when the vessel's
delivery yas "actual and complete" at Port 2olbourne.
The ship-owner did all he could to perform his contract.
It was the duty of the owner of the cargo to provide means
at the port of delivery for unlading the cargo. The owner
of the cargo not providing these means, the ship-owner was
right in delivering his cargo at the nearest practical commercial point, which was Buffalo. He was not bound to
wait for days, to his great detriment, and look to the possibility of recovering his damages of the shipper, or ultimate
consignee, while that owner or consignee was continually

guilty of breaking his contract by not providing means for
-anlading the vessel.
In Cleadaniel v. Tuckerman,* a New York case, it was held
that it is the duty of a consignee to receive; that he must do
this within a reasonable time; that his duty and responsibility in this respect is the same, after a reasonable time has
elapsed, as in the case where lay days and demurrage are
stipulated for in the bill of lading, and that after that reasonable time has elapsed the ship-owner may store the cargo
elsewhere and recover his freight and damages.
Our conduct here was quite according to this case, which
holds, further, that it is the duty of the carrier, under such
circumstances, to store the goods in some place of safety,
retaining his lien for his freight, &c.
Suppose it had appeared that the property could have
been delivered at another dock? Would not the ship-owner
have had a right to deliver there and to claim freight?
Beyond question. "The different ports around the Western
lakes are really, in principle, other docks, as to Western
produce seeking its market on the seaboard.
Nor was it necessary that the master should have telegraphed to Oswego. There is no proof of any custom to
do so. The carrier's business was to perform his contract
according to law. He did so perform it here. He was not
bound to address the owners of the cargo, for the purpose
of ascertaining whether they would make a new contract.
Why require notice to a man whose business it was to be at
the port, and there absolve himself from his responsibilities
to receive the cargo? Besides, the case shows, in eflect,
that nothing could be done with the property at Port Colbourne. There was but one elevator there, and that was
full. The law will not require a futile notice. The doctrine
in relation to notice only applies where the owner or consignee is at the port, and can in some way take possession
of the property.
To say that the master knew about the place, and should

have provided against delay by special contract, begs the
question. The shipper also knew about the place. It was
his duty to see that the property was received, and if he
desired to qualify that duty, he should have provided for it
in the contract.
27r. Ganson, contra, for the consignees.
Mr. Justice MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
It is not necessary to determine whether the libellant in
this case, who was owner of the ship, contracted to deliver
the wheat to the consignees at Oswego, or whether he contracted to deliver it at Port Colbourne. The bill of lading
given by the master of the vessel, shows that it was understood that from Chicago to Port Colbourne was only part
of the voyage which the wheat was to make, and that from
Port Colbourne it was to be forwarded by the Welland Railway on its further voyage.
The testimony is clear, that at Port Colbourne there is an
elevator belonging to that railroad company, and that it is
the only one; aud that there is no other warehouse or receptacle in which the wheat could be stored. The course of the
trade demands that wheat shipped to Port Colbourne must
go through that elevator, and if the vessels making delivery
are so numerous that it cannot relieve them promptly, they
must await their turn. The master of the vessel must be
held to have made his contract with a full knowledge of this
course of trade, and be governed by it. ]He had, therefore,
no right, when he found there would be a delay of several
days in delivering his cargo at the elevator, to carry it to
BuffHalo at the expense of the owner.
There is another matter in which the master failed in his
duty. There was a telegraphic line in operation between
Port Colbourne and Oswego, where the consignees resided,
and he could, at any time during the three days he lay at
Port Colbourne, have notified them of his difficulty, and
received their instructions. He did nothing of the kind;
but, after waiting about half the time that would have been

required to enable him to discharge his cargo, he sailed to
