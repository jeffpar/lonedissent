ALLEN v. THE ASSESSORS.

573

Statement of the case.

It is the obvious policy of this act to enable a class of vessels which are engaged in both the foreign and the coasting
trade at the same time, to do so without the necessity of
taking out both a register and an enrolment. Fqr this purpose the act makes the enrolment equivalent to both register
and enrolment. In giving to the enrolment the effect of a
register, it very properly subjects the vessel to all the rules,
regulations, and penalties relating to registered vessels. One
of these penalties, as we have already seen, is the forfeiture
of the vessel, for the fraudulent use of a certificate of registry, when she is not actually entitled to the benefit thereof.
The statements of the libel and the evidence in the case
which supports them bring the Mohawk within this penalty.
DECREE REVERSED, and the case remanded, with instructions to enter a decree of forfeiture and condemnation of the
vessel.
VAN ALLEN V. THE AssEssoRs.
1. The act of June 2, 1864, "To provide a national currency," &c., rightly
construed, subjects the shares of the banking associations authorized by
it, and in the bands of shareholders, to taxation by the States under
certain limitations (set forth in its 41st section), without regarA to the
fact that a part or the whole of the capital of such association is invested in national securities declared by the statutes authorizing them
to be "exempt from taxation by or under State authority."
2. The act thus construed is constitutional.
8. The act of 9th Mareh, 1865, of the legislature of New York, sometimes
called the Enabling Act, and which enacts that shares in any of these
national banking associations held by any person or body corporate
shall be "included in the valuation of the personal property of such
person or body corporate, in the assessment of taxes in the town or
ward where such banking association is located and not elsewhere,"
&c., but which did not provide that the tax imposed should not exceed
the rate imposed upon the shares of any of the banks organized under
the authority of the State, is not warranted by the act of Congress, and
is void: there having been under the legislation of the State no tax
laid on shares in State banks at all ; though there was a tax on the
capital of such banks.

created under the act of Congress of June, 1864. The case
wa thus:
By an act passed February 25th, 1863, Congress provided
for the organization of national banking associations ;* and
the act was amended and re-enacted on the 3d June, 1864.t
By these laws the mode of organizing these associations
was prescribed, their powers defined, and their duties enjoined. The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to
employ them as depositories of the public moneys, and as
financial agents of the government, taking, however, sufficient security for the faithful performance of those duties.
The general supervision of their action was committed to a
comptroller of the currency, to be appointed by the President on the nomination of the secretary. No association
could be organized with a less capital than fifty thousand
dollars, or less than one hundred thousand dollars in any
place with more than six thousand inhabitants; or less than
two hundred thousand dollars in any place with more than
fifty thousand inhabitants. The whole capital was required
to be paid in within five months; fifty per centum at the
commencement, and ten per centum every month thereafter.
Of this capital at least one-third was required to be invested
in interest-bearing bonds of the United States, which were
to be deposited with the treasurer of the United States.
Provision was also made for the preparation of circulating
notes of different denominations, of uniform general appearance, and for the delivery to each association of an amount
of these notes equal to ninety per centum of the amount of
bonds deposited with the treasurer. These notes were made
payable by the associations to whom they were delivered,
and they were required to pay them on demand. To secure
more certainly prompt redemption by the several associations of these notes and of deposits, each association was required to keep always on hand an amount of lawful money
equal, in certain cities named, to twenty-five per centum,
and in other places to fifteen per centum of its outstanding

circulation and its deposits; and to accumulate a surplus
fund equal to twenty per centum of its capital. In case of
default in payment by any association, the notes were to be
paid by the United States, and the bonds deposited were to
be either cancelled or sold, at the option of the government.
The entire amount of note circulation was limited to three
hundred millions of dollars, to be apportioned among the associations in the different States and Territories, partly according to the rule of representative population, and partly
according to their existing banking capital, resources, and
business. The notes were made receivable by all the associations for all debts and liabilities whatever; receivable by
all associations employed as depositories, when deposited by
the United States; receivable also by the United States for all
dues except duties on imports; and by all persons for all dues
from the United States, except interest on public debt.
Such are the distinguishing features of the rational Banking, or National Currency Act. The general objects of the
act are apparent from them.
These associations possess, under the act, all the powers
necessary for carrying on the business of banking, by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of
exchange, and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits, buying and selling exchange, coin, and bullion; by
lending money on personal security; by obtaining, issuing,
and circulating notes according to the provisions of this act,
&c. The duration of the charter is twenty years.
Certain provisions, particularly ascertaining the duties and
functions of these national banking associations, may thus
be stated:
The persons forming an association are required to make
a certificate, which shall specify, among other things, the
amount of its capital stock, and the number of shares into
which the same shall be divided, the names and places of
residence of the shareholders, and the number of shares
held by each.* The capital stock is to be divided into shares

of $100 each, and is to be deemed personal property. The
shareholders of the association are to be held individually
responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, fbr
all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association to
the extent of the amount of their stock therein at the par
value, in addition to the amount invested in such shares.*
In the election of directors, and in deciding all questions at
meetings of shareholders, each shareholder shall be entitled
to one vote on each share of stock held by him.t Fifty per
cent. of the capital stock of every association must be paid in
before it shall commence business, and the remainder in instalments of at least ten per cent. per month till the whole
amount is paid; and if any shareholder, or his assignee, shall
fail to make the payment, or any instalment on his stock,
the directors may sell the stock at public auction.t No association can make any loan or discount on the security of
the shares of its own capital.ยง
By the 40th section of the act of 1864 it is enacted-the
act of 1863 containing no such provision"That the president and cashier of every such association
shall cause to be kept, at all times, a full and correct list of the
names and residences of all the shareholders in the association,
and the number of shares held by each, in the office where its
business is transacted, and such list shall be subject to the inspection of all shareholders and creditors of the association, and
the officers authorized to assess taxes under State authority, during
business hours of each day," &c.
The 41st section, of the same act of 1864, provides by one
part of it for taxation by the United States. It imposes a tax of
one per cent. annually on circulation; one-half of one per
cent. on deposits, and then one-half of one per cent. on the
capital beyond the amount invested in United States bonds; and
after prescribing how the duty is to be collected, and the
penalty for default, &c., the section proceeds:

also, that nothing in this act shall exempt the real estate of associations from either State, county, or municipal taxes to the
same extent, according to its value, as other real estate is taxed."
With this statute of the Federal Government, authorizing
banking associations, in force, the legislature of New York,
on the 9th March, 1865, passed "on act, enabling the banks
of this State to become associations for the purposes of
bank-ing, under the laws of the United States."* The act,
frequently called "The Enabling Act," imposed a tax upon
all shares in national banks, in the hands of their holders.
The section laying the tax ran thus:
"ยง 10. All the shares in any of the said banking associations,
organized under . . . the act of Congress, held by any person

or body corporate, shall be included in the valuation of the personal property of such person or body corporate or corporation,

banking association is located, and not elsewhere, whether the
holder thereof reside in such town or ward, or not; but not at
a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in
the hands of individuals of this State,. provided that the tax so
imposed upon such shares shall not exceed the par value thereof;
and provided further, that the real estate of such associations
shall be subject to State, county, or municipal taxes, to the same
extent, according to the value, as other real estate is taxed."
This act, it will be noted, laid no rate or tax whatever "upon

the shares in any of the banks organized under the authority
of the State," as seems to have been contemplated as necessary by the second proviso of the 41st section of the National
Banking Act of 1864; and, indeed, under the legislation of
New York, as it appeared, no rate or tax whatever was laid
upon shares in State banks at all; though there was one laid
on their capital.
However, assuming the validity of this State law whether
with or without this proviso, the Board of Assessors, at the
city of Albany, assessed one Van Allen for fifty shares, owned
by him, of the capital stock of the First National Bank of
that city, and assessed all the other shareholders in like
manner for theirs. At the ti'me of the assessment, the whole
capital qf the bank was invested in various obligations qf the
.federal Government; in regard to all of which, Congress had
enacted that, "whether held by individuils, corporatio'ns,or associations," they should be "exemnptfron taxation by or under State
authority."
Van Allen and the other stockholders insisted before the
board that the shares of the bank held by them, as stockholders, were not subject to assessment and taxation under
State authority; that the enabling act of the New York
legislature of 9th March, 1865, was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and also to the laws of the
United States. These positions the board denied, and it
enforced the tax which had been assessed. On a case stated
by the stockholders on the one side, and the Board of
Assessors on the other, the question was now taken to the
Supreme Court of the State, and thence to the Court of
Appeals. This latter court-the highest court of law or
equity of the State-having affirmed the authority of the
Board of Assessors to lay the tax, the case came here on
error.*

That the reader may be possessed not only of the essential case, but of some of its important incidents, it may be
well to mention that, prior to the enactment of either of the
National Banking laws, and while its State Bank system was
in operation, the legislature of New York (A. D. 1857) had
enacted that the capital stock of the banks of the State
should be "assessed at its actual value, and taxed in the
same manner as other personal and real estate of the country." With the State system and the enactment just mentioned in force, several of the banks of New York became,
soon after the rebellion broke out, owners of large amounts
of the bonds of the United States, and in regard to which,
as already said, Congress had, in the statute authorizing
them, enacted* that, "whether held by individuals or corI2oratioas, they shall be exempt from taxation by or under
,State authority."
On a question between those banks as
formed under the general State system in New York, and the
tax commissioners of the State, this court decided, in March,
1863, in the -Bank of Commerce v. New iYork City;, that the
tax referred to was a tax upon the stock; and that being so,
it was by the settled law of this court-as declared in W1eston
v. The City of Clhadeston;. .31ckdloch v. The State of Marylad;ยง Osborne v. The Bank of the Ui ited States[i (well known
decisions of this court, and in which M.ARSHALL, C. J., had
given its judgment), and other cases-illegally imposed.

New York passed another statute,lf which enacted that "all

Statement of the case.

banks, &c., should be liable to taxation on a valuation equal to
thte amount of their capital stock paid in., or secured to be paid in,
&c., in the manner now provided by law," &c. On a tax
laid, under this act, by the commissioners, upon the different
banks of New York city, some of which had invested their
whole capital in the securities of the Federal Government,
and others of which had largely done so, the question was,
whether this second act did or did not also impose a tax
upon the stock? This court, on appeal from the highest
court of the State, decided, in the beginning of 1865, in
what is known as the Bank Tax Case,* that it did. It was
within a few days after that decision that the enactment
on which the present case arose-a third enactment in the
principal matter-was made. Its language was obviously
directed to avoid some difficulties which had proved insurmountable in the Bank Tax Case, and in cases before it.
Whether it did really avoid them, or whether the new lkgislation of the State had the fault of exalting the forms and
phrases of legislation above its substance and effect, was, in
fact, one great question in the case; others being (i) whether
Congress had meant, by the first proviso to the 41st section
of the act of 1864, to authorize States to lay a tax on shares
in National Banks whose whole capital consisted of national
securities, declared in the laws authorizing them to be exempt from taxation by States; and (ii) whether, if it did,
such an act would or would not be open to the objection of
being an attempt by Congress to deliver over to others,
powers vested by the Federal Constitution in it alone; and
be, therefore, an act unconstitutional.
A minor question-treated preliminarily-was, whether,
admitting the power of the State, under the provisos of the
41st section of the act of Congress, to tax the shares by an
enactment framed with the limitations prescribed by the
three provisos in it, this particular act of the State of New
York, passed March 9, 1865, which apparently omitted the
second one, was an enactment of the kind required?

VAN ALLEN V. THE ASSESSORS.

581

Opinion of the court.

Numerous counsel appeared in the matter; some in this
immediate case, others in other cases just like it from the
other places. Among them Mr. Ecaris, Mr. Sedgwick, Mr.
Trewaiiie, te1s&srs. Pdad ids and l2 er, argued against the
right of the States to tax, and Mr. Kernan, 3r.A. J. Parker,
and Mr. Reeynolds in favor of it. After naming such counsel
it need not be remarked that everything possible to be well
said was said as well as possible. The fact that the main
matter is fully and admirably argued from the bench-in
the opinion of the court on the one hand, and in the opinion
delivered in behalf of the judges who did not concur in it on
the other-renders it unnecessary for the reporter to present the discussion at the bar.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The decree of the Court of Appeals, from which this ease
comes to us, must be reversed, on the ground that the enabling act of the State of New York, passed Marcl 9, 1865,
does not conform to the limitations prescribed by the fortyfirst section of the act of Congress, passed June 8, 1864,
organizing the national banks, and providing for their taxation. The defect is this: one of the limitations in the act
of Congress is, "that the tax so imposed under the laws of
any State upon the shares of the associations authorized by
this act, shall not exceed the rate imposed upon the shares
of any of-the banks organized under the authority of the
State where such association is located." The enabling act
of the State contains no such limitation. The banks of the
State are taxed upon their capital; and although the act
provides that the tax on the shares of the national banks
shall not exceed the par value, yet, inasmuch as the capital
of the State banks may consist of the bonds of the United
States, which are exempt from State taxation, it is easy to
see that this tax on the capital is not an equivalent for a tax
on the shares of the stockholders.
This is an unimportant question, however, as the defect
may be readily remedied by the State legislature.
The main and important question involved, and the one

VAN ALLEN

v. ThE ASSESSORS.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

which has been argued at great length and with eminent
ability, is, whether the State possesses the power to authorize
the taxation of the shares of these national banks in the
hands of stockholders, whose capital is wholly vested in stock
a~d bonds of the United States?
The court are of opinion that this power is possessed by
the State, and that it is due to the several cases which have
been so fully and satisfactorily argued before us at this term,
as well as to the public interest involved, that the question
should be finally disposed of. I shall proceed, therefore,
to state, as briefly as practicable, the grounds and reasons
that have led to their judgment in the case.
The first act providing for the organization of these national banks, passed 25th February, 1863, contained no provision concerning State taxation of these shares; but Congress reserved the right by the last section at any time "to
amend, alter, or repeal the act." The present act of 1864
is a re-enactment of the prior statute, with some material
amendments, of which the section concerning State taxation
is one.
It will be readily perceived, on adverting to the act, that
the powers and privileges conferred by it upon these associations are very great powers and privileges;-founded upon
a new use and application of these government bonds, especially the privilege of issuing notes to circulate in the community as money, to the amount of ninety per centum of
the bonds deposited with the treasurer; thereby nearly doubling their amount for all the operations and business purposes of the bank. This currency furnishes means and facilities for conducting the operations of the associations, which,
if used wisely and skilfully, cannot but result in great advantages and profits to all the members of the association-the
shareholders of the bank.
In the granting of chartered rights and privileges by government, especially if of great value to the corporators,
certain burdens are usually, if not generally, imposed as
conditions of the grant. Accordingly we find them in this
charter. They are very few, but distinctly stated.

Dec. 1[865.]

VAN ALLEN v. ThE AsSESSORS.

583

Opinion of the court.

They are, first, a duty of one-half of one per centum each
half year, upon the average amount of its notes in circulation; second, a duty of one-quarter of one per centum each
half year upon the average amount of its deposits; third, a
duty of one-quarter of one per centum each half year on the
average amount of its capital stock beyond the amount invested in United States bonds; and fourth, a State tax upon
the shares of the association held by the stockholders, not
greater than assessed on other moneyed capital in the State,
nor to exceed the rate on shares of stock of State banks.
These are the only burdens annexed to the enjoyment of
the great chartered rights and privileges that we find in this
act of Congress; and no objection is made to either of them
except the last,-the limited State taxation.
Although it has been suggested, yet it can hardly be said
to have been argued, that the provision in the act of Congress concerning the taxation of the shares by the State is
unconstitutional. The suggestion is, that it is a tax by the
State upon the bonds of the government which constitute
the capital of the bank, and which this court has heretofore
decided to be illegal. But this suggestion is scarcely well
founded; for were we to admit, for the sake of the argument, this to be a tax of the bonds or capital stock of the
bank, it is but a tax upon the new uses and new privileges
conferred by the charter of the association; it is but a condition annexed to the enjoyment of this new use and new
application of the bonds; and if Congress possessed the
power to grant these new rights and new privileges, which
none of the learned counsel has denied, and which the whole
argument assumes, then we do not see but the power to
annex the conditions is equally clear and indisputable. The
question involved is altogether a different one from that
decided in the previous bank cases, and stands upon different
considerations. The State tax, under this act of Congress,
involves no question as to the pledged faith of the government. The tax is the condition for the new rights and
privileges conferred upon these associations.
But, in addition to this view, the tax on the shares is not

VAN ALLEN v. THE ASSESSORS.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the
legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal; and within the powers conferred upon it by the
charter, and for the purposes for which it was created, can
deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private
individual can deal with his own. This is familiar law, and
will be found in every work that may be opened on the subject of corporations. A striking exemplification may be
seen in the case of the Qieen v. A-noud.* The question related
to the registry of a ship owned by a corporation. lord Denman observed: "It appears to me that the British corporation is, as such, the sole owner of the ship. The individual
members of the corporation are no doubt interested in one
sense in the property of the corporation, as they may derive
individual benefits from its increase, or loss from its decrease; but in no legal sense are the individual members
the owners."
The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate
in the net profits earned by the bank in the employment of
its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion
to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or
termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This
is a distinct independent interest or property, held by the
shareholder like any other property that may belong to him.
Now, it is this interest which the act of Congress has left
subject to taxation by the States, under the limitations prescribed, as will be seen on referring to it.
That act provides as follows:
" That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all
the shares of any of the said associations, held by any person
or body corporate, from being included in the valuation of personal property of such person or corporation in the assessment
of taxes imposed by and under State authority, at the place
where such bank is located, and not elsewhere, but not at a
greaterrate than is assessed upon other moneyed capitalin the hands

Opinion of the court.

of individual eitizens of such State; PROVIDED farther, that the tax
6o inposed under the laws of any State, upon the shares of the assoc ton5rs, authorized by this act, shall not exceed the rate imposed upon
the shares of any of the banks organized under the authority of the
State where such association is located: PROVIDED, also, that nothing in this aet shall exempt the real estate of associations from
either State, county, or municipal taxes, to the same extent,
according to its value, as other real estate is taxed."'' It is said that Congress possesses no power to confer upon
a State authority to be exercised which has been exclusively delegated to that body by the Constitution, and, consequently, that it cannot confer upon a State the sovereign
right of taxation; nor is a State competent to receive a grant
of any such power from Congress. We agree to this. But
as it respects a subject-matter over which Congress and the
States may exercise a concurrent power, but from the exercise of which Congress, by reason of its paramount authority, may exclude the States, there is no doubt Congress may
withhold the exercise of that authority and leave the States
free to act. An example of this relation existing between
the Federal and State governments is found in the pilotlaws of the States, and the health and quarantine laws.
The power of taxation under the Constitution as a general
rule, and as has been repeatedly recognized in adjudged
eases in this court, is a concurrent power. The qualifications of the rule are the exclusion of the States from the
taxation of the means and instruments employed in the
exercise of the functions of the Federal Government.
The remaining question is, has Congress legislated in respect to these associations, so as to leave the shares of the
stockholders subject to State taxation?
We have already referred to the main provision of the act
of Congress on this subject, and it will be seen it declares
"that nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all
the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person,
or body corporate, from being included in the valuation of

the personal property of such person or corporation in the
assessment of taxes imposed by or under State authority, at
the place where such bank is located :" and in another section of the act* it is declared "that the president and cashier
of every such association shall cause to be kept, at all times,
a full and correct list of the names and residences of all the
shareholders in the' association, and the number of shares
held by each, in the office where its business is transacted,
and such list shall be subject to the inspection of all shareholders and creditors of the association, and the officers authorized to assess taxes under Stale authority, during business hours
of each day," &c.
These two provisions-the one declaring that nothing in
the act shall be construed to prevent the shares from being
included in the valuation of the personal property, &c., in
the assessment of taxes imposed by State authority; and the
other providing for the keeping of the list of the names and
residences of the shareholders, among other things, for the
inspection of the officers authorized to assess the State taxes
-not only recognize, in express terms, the sovereign right
of the State to tax, but prescribe regulations and duties to
these associations, with a view to disembarrass the officers
of the State engaged in the exercise of this right. Xothing,
it would seem, could be made plainer, or more direct and
comprehensive on the subject. The language of the several
provisions is so explicit and positive as scarcely to call for
judicial construction.
Then, as to the shares, and what is intended by the use
of the term? The language of the act is equally explicit
and decisive.
The persons forming an association are required to make
a certificate, which shall specify, among other things, the
amount of its capital stock, and the number of shares into
which the same shall be divided, the names and places of
residence of the shareholders, and the number of shares 1opld
by each.t The capital stock shall be divided into shmA's of

the valuation of the personal property of any person or corporation in the assessment of taxes imposed by State authority, &c., can there be a doubt but that the term "shares,"
as used in this connection, means the same interest as when
used in the other portions of the act? Take, for examples,
'the use of the term in the certificate of the numbers of shares

amount, and, in addition, to the amount invested in such
shares; in the election of directors, and in deciding all questions at meetings of the stockholders, each share is entitled
to one vote; in regulations of the payments of the shares
subscribed; and, finally, in the list of shares kept for the inspection of the State assessors. In all these instances, it is
manifest that the term as used means the entire interest of
the shareholder; and it would be singular, if in the use of
the term in the connection of State taxation, Congress intended a totally different meaning, without any indication
of such intent.
This is an answer to the argument that the term, as used
here, means only the interest of the shareholder as representing the portion of the capital, if any, not invested in the
bonds of the government, and that the State assessors must
institute an inquiry into the investment of the capital of the
bank, and ascertain what portion is invested in these bonds,
and make a discrimination in the assessment of the shares.
If Congress had intended any such discrimination, it would
have been an easy matter to have said so. Certainly, so
grave and important a change in the use of this term, if so
intended, would not have been left to judicial construction.
Upon the whole, after the maturest consideration which
we have been able to give to this case, we are satisfied that
the States possess the power to tax the whole of the interest
of the shareholder in the shares held by him in these associations, within the limit prescribed by the act authorizing
their organization. But, for the reasons stated in the forepart of the opinion, the judgment must be reversed and the
case remitted to the Court of Appeals of the State of New
York, with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs in
error, with costs.
The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the following opinion in
his own behalf, and in behalf of Associate Justices WAYNE
and SWAYKE:
The court is unanimous in the opinion that the judgment
of the Court of Appeals of New York must be reversed, be-

cause the shares of the national banking associations are not
taxed by the law of New York according to one branch of
the rule prescribed by the act of Congress; that is to qay, as
the shares of the banks of the State are taxed.
A minority of the members of the court, however, is unable to concur upon one very important point, with the
opinion just read.
That opinion maintains the proposition, that under the
national currency acts, the shares of the capital of national
banking associations are subject to State taxation without
any reference to the amount of such capital invested in bonds
of the United States.
We think that such taxation is actual, though indirect,
taxation of the bonds; that it is matter of doubt whether,
under the Constitution, Congress has power, without express
reservation in the loan acts, to authorize such taxation; and
that taxation by the States of the shares of national banking
associations, without reference to the amount of the capital
invested in national securities, is not authorized, nor was intended to be authorized by Congress.
We will proceed to state the grounds of this opinion.
By an act passed February 25th, 1863, Congress provided
for the organization of national banking associations for the
purpose of enabling the national government to execute
more effectually its constitutional powers and functions; and
the act was amended and re-enacted on the 8d June, 1864.
It is unnecessary to examine minutely the various provisions by which the powers and duties and functions of
these national banking associations are particularly ascertained and regulated. The general purpose of the act of
Congress cannot be misconceived. It is to authorize the
organization of associations to be employed, not only in
the service of the government as depositories and financial
agents, but especially in facilitating the collection of internal
duties, and the transfer and disbursement of public moneys,
and in furnishing to the people a safe and uniform note circulation, convertible immediately into notes of the United
States, and to be made convertible into coin as soon as the

VAN ALLEN V. THE ASSESSOIIS.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

government shall provide for the payment of its own notes
in that medium.
The qualities, powers, and duties, as national agencies, of
these associations, resemble, in almost all essential particulars, those of the Bank of the United States authorized by
the act of April 10th, 1816. Like that bank, they are organized under national legislation. Their capital, like four-fifths
of the capital of that bank, is supplied by individual subscriptions. They are employed, like that bank, as agents
and depositories of the national government.
While that bank, however, was organized as one great
moneyed corporation, with power to establish branches in
the several States, subject to its central power, these associations, under the limitations prescribed by Congress, are
formed whenever and wherever citizens, possessing the necessary means, see fit to organize under the law; and they
are subject to no control except that of the government executing the law. It is also to be remembered that while the
notes of that bank represented nothing but securities held
by the bank itself, and were expected to form but a small
part of the note circulation of the country, the notes of
these associations, besides being secured as to immediate
redemption by the several associations, which pay them
out, through the deposit of United States bonds, are, in
substance and to all practical intents, the obligations of the
government itself; and are intended, in connection with the
notes issued directly by the government, to supply the entire note circulation of all the States and all the Territories
of the Union.
These observations show that the national banking associations are much more intimately connected in their functions and operations with the national government, than was
the Bank of the United States. They are, therefore, entitled
to all the protection and all the immunities to which that
bank was entitled.
The relations of that bank to the government, and ite
right to prntection from State interference and control, were
fully considered in the case of McCulloch v. The State of 31ary-

land, decided in 1819, and again in the case of Osborne v. 27e
Band: of the United States, decided in 1824.
That Congress may constitutionally organize or constitute

agencies for carrying into effect the national powers granted
by the Constitution; that these agencies may be organized
by the voluntary association of individuals, sanctioned by
Congress; that Congress may give to such agencies, so organized, corporate urity, permanence, and efficiency; and
that such agencies in their being, capital, franchises, and
operations, are not subject to the taxing power of the States,
have ever been regarded, since those decisions, as settled
doctrines of this court.
Those decisions were the judgments of great men and
great judges. They were pronounced bythe most illustrious
of their number, and are distinguished by his peculiar clearness and cogency of reasoning. For nearly half a century
the principles vindicated by them have borne the keen
scrutiny of an enlightened profession, and the sharp criticism of able statesmen; and they remain unshaken. All
the judges who concurred in them have descended, long
since, into honored graves; but their judgments endure,
and, gathering vigor from time and general consent, have
acquired almost the force of constitutional sanctions.
We assume, then, that the national banking associations,
as such, and in their powers, functions, and operations, are
not subject to taxation by the States, on the ground that
State laws imposing such taxation are repugnant to the law
of Congress by which they are established and sanctioned.
The same principle of exemption was applied in 1829, by
a judgment of this court in the case of Weston v. The City of
CIarieston,* to the bonds and other securities of the United
States in the hands of individuals. The opinion was delivered by the same great judge who pronounced the two
former judgments, and the doctrine was summed up thus:
"The tax on government stock is thought by this court to be
a tax on the contract, a tax on the power to borrow money on

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

the credit of the United States, and consequently to be repugnant to the Constitution; and this doctrine has ever since been
maintained as settled law."
More recently the same principle has been applied generally to the taxation of the capital of associations and corporations, so far as invested in national securities.
This was first done in the case of the Bank of Cormnmeree v.
New York.* The legislature of New York imposed taxes
on banking capital as upon other real and personal property
of individuals according to valuation. This court held that
the bonds and other securities of the United States, included
in such valuation, were not liable to be taxed by State authority.
The legislature of New York subsequently provided for
the taxation of the capital of banks by an arbitrary valuation;
that is to say, by requiring the valuation for taxation to be
equal to the sum of the capital paid in and secured to be
paid in, without reference to its actual value at the time of
valuation; and it was then insisted, in behalf of the State
commissioners of taxes, that this was a tax on the franchise
and not on the property, and that no inquiry could be made,
therefore, as to the component elements of the capital, with
a view to ascertain whether any of them were exempt from
taxation. But this court held that the tax was really on the
property of the bank, and could not be constitutionvIly assessed upon that part of it which consisted of national bonds
and securities.t
And it may now be regarded as-settled law that the national securities forming part of the property of individual
citizens or associations, or of the capital of banks or banking
associations, are not subject to taxation by or under State
authority.
But it was urged in argument that, though the capital of
a bank, so far as it consists of national securities, is exempt
from State taxation, the shares of that capital may be taxed

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, J..

without reference to the legislation of Congress, and without
regard to the national securities which they represent.
If this were admitted, it would follow that the legislature
of New York, by merely shifting its taxation from the capital
to the shares, might have avoided the whole effect of the
exemptions sanctioned by the decisions just cited. The same
tax on the same identical property, without any exemption
of national securities, might have been assessed and collected
by adopting the simple expedient of assessment on the shares
of capital, instead of the aggregate of capital-on the parts
instead of the whole. The whole tax, too, might have been
collected from the very same officers who were authorized
by those decisions to refuse payment of so much of it as was
derived from national securities, by adopting the equally

simple expedient of requiring those officers to deduct the tax
on the shares from the accruing dividends, and pay it over
to the State collector.
We do not understand the majority of the court as asserting that shares of capital invested in national securities could
be taxed without authority from Congress. We certainly
cannot yield our assent to any such proposition. To do so
would, in our judgment, deprive the decisions just cited of
all practical value and effect, and make the exemption from
State taxation of national securities held by banks as investments of capital wholly unreal and illusory.
We will consider the question, therefore, as one of construction.
The majority of the court bold that the act of Congress,
rightly construed, subjects the shares of the national associations to taxation by the States, without regard to investment
of a part or the whole of their capital in national securities;
and that the act thus construed is warranted by the Constitution. We dissent.
It may be well questioned, in our judgment, whether Congress has power under the Constitution to authorize State
taxation of national securities, either directly or indirectly.
Taxation of national securities is taxation upon the contracts of the United States, and may be regarded, not unrea.

sonably, as impairing their obligation, unless provision is
made for such taxation in the laws authorizing the loans
for which they are issued. It is not alleged that any such
provision is contained in the acts under which the government issued the bonds held by the national banking associations. On the contrary, these acts contain express stipulations with the national creditors that the bonds issued under
them shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or
municipal authority. This is, in effect, a stipulation on the
part of Congress that the takers of the government loan shall
have the right to use the bonds issued to them for any lawful
purpose, free from State or municipal taxation.
Can Congress, notwithstanding this stipulation, authorize
States to tax these bonds indirectly by taxing the capital or
the shares of capital invested in them?
There is sufficient reason, we think, for a negative answer,
to make it our duty not to presume without the clearest
evidence that Congress has actually authorized such taxation. And were the power to authorize such taxation clear,
a superior question would remain,-the question of good
faith, of public virtue, of national honor.
We come, then, to the construction of the act.
In enacting the National Bank Law, Congress must have
had in view the great principles already established by th6
decisions of this court: (1) that States cannot tax the agencies of the national government; (2) that States cannot tax
the national securities in the hands of individual citizens;
(3) that States cannot tax the national securities in which
may be invested the whole or a part of the capital of any
association or corporation.
They also had in view, doubtless, the exception to exemption suggested by Chief Justice Marshall, in
.lctoch v.
.1'aryland, when he said that the opinion of the court did
"not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the bank
in common with the real property within the State, nor to
a tax imposed on the interest which the citizens of Maryland
might hold in the institution in common with the property
of the same description throughout the State."

Dec. 1865.]

VAN ALLEN v. THE ASSESSORS.

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

With these principles and this exception in view, Congress, in order that nothing might be left to inference, expressly authorized State taxation of the real estate held by
the national banking associations, and of the interest of
private citizens in them. This was done by three provisos
to the forty-first section, which prescribed the measure and
rule of national taxation. These provisos are as follows:
(1.) ".Provided, that nothing in this act shall be construed to
prevent all the shares in any of said associations, held by any
person or body corporate, from being included in the valuation
of the personal property of such person or corporation in the
assessment of taxes imposed by or under State authority, at the
place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere, but not at
it greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in
the bands of individual citizens of such State. (2.) Provided
farther,that the tax so imposed under the laws of any State shall
not exceed the rate imposed upon the shares in any of the banks
organized under authority of the State where such association
is located. (3.) Provided also, that nothing in this act shall ex-

empt the real estate of associations from either State, county, or
municipal taxes to the same extent, according to its value, as
other real estate is taxed."
We do not doubt the power of Congress to enact these
provisos. The only ground upon which exemption from
State taxes of the capital, franchises, operations, or property
of corporations or associations has been adjudged by this
court, is that of the repugnancy of such taxation to the acts
of Congress organizing such corporations or associations,
and making them the agencies or instruments of the national
government.
The doctrine is, that Congress may create corporations or
authorize associations, as means, instruments, or agents for
the execution of national powers, and that such corporations
or associations, being such means, instruments, or agents,
are exempted from State taxation. But such corporations
and associations must be organized in such manner, under
such limitations, and with such liabilities as Congress may
see fit to prescribe. If in the judgment of Congress, there.

fore, the purposes of their organization will be better, oi
more safely fulfilled if subjected, in some respects, to State
taxation, the acts authorizing their establishment may be so
framed as to allow such taxation, excepting, probably, national securities, as already suggested.
We proceed to consider the effect of these provisos; pausing only to observe that there is nothing in the suggestion
of Chief Justice Marshall, in conformity with which they
were probably framed, which warrants any inference that it
ever entered into his mind that the national stock or bonds
could be taxed indirectly, by taxing the interest of citizens
in the Bank of the United States. The question of State
taxes upon national securities was not at all considered in
that case. If it had been, we cannot doubt that the clear
intelligence, under the inspection of which all propositions
seemed to resolve themselves into their elements, would
have detected taxation of bonds under the disguise of taxation of the capital or shares of capital in which they were
invested, and would have pronounced against the indirect
as decisively as it did afterwards, in 7eston v. Charleston,
against the direct taxation.
What, then, was the intent of Congress? We think it
not very difficult to collect it from the provisos.
In most of the States, if not in all, the personal property
of all individuals and corporations is listed, valued and assessed by public officers under legislative authority. The
first proviso simply requires that the shares of individuals in
national banking associations shall be included in this valuation and assessment; and, inasmuch as personal property
of different descriptions is often valued and assessed by different rules, it further requires that it shall not be so included at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed
capital in the hands of citizens. The second proviso merely
introduces another standard, by comparison with which the
taxation of these shares is to be regulated, and requires that
the tax imposed on them shall not exceed the rate imposed
by the State on the shares of banks organized under its authority.

Dee. 1865.] VMN ALLEN v. THE ASSESSORS.

597

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

We think this the plain sense of these provisos. They
adopt the exception admitted by Chief Justice Marshall to
the rule of exemption in McCulloch v. 3lanjland. They subject the interests held by citizens in the national banking
associations to a tax in common with other property of the
same description, and they give to the exception a practical
application by determining what property is of the same
description with the interest to be taxed in common with it.
Now, by taxation in common, we understand taxation by
a common rule and in equal degrees. To tax the shares of
citizens in these associations by other rules, or in greater degrees than other like property, would as effectually retard,
impede, burden, and control the operation of the national
currency act as to tax the associations themselves or their
lawful operations, and would be clearly unwarranted by the
Constitution.
What then is the rule, and what the degree in which taxes
can be imposed by the States on moneyed capital in the
bands of individual citizens?
So fir as that capital consists of ordinary funds or securities acquired or held under the laws of the States, the measure of taxation must necessarily be determined by the discretion of the State legislature. The responsibility of their
members to the people, their own interests in common with
those of their constituents, their knowledge, their justice,
and their wisdom must be relied on for security against injustice. But so far as that capital consists of bonds or other
securities of the United States, it cannot be taxed at all by
State authority in the hands of individual citizens. That
portion is exempted by the Constitution, as interpreted by
this court in the cases already cited.
Here, then, we have the common rule and common degree of taxation applicable alike to shares in national banking associations and to moneyed capital in the hands of individuals. That proportion of each which is liable to taxation must be taxed alike; that proportion of each which is
exempt under the Constitution must not be taxed at all by
State authority. Taxation of the former by no greater rate

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

than the latter, means equal taxation for both. Any construction of the proviso which denies the same exemptions
to the proportion of the shares invested in national securities,
which it concedes to the like proportion of other moneyed
capital invested in like manner, seems to us manifestly at
variance with the declared intention of Congress.
But, it is insisted that the shares of capital may be taxed
by another rule than that which governs the taxation of
other moneyed capital, because of something peculiar in the
nature of shares. It is said, that the association owns the
capital, and that the shareholders have no control over this
property except through the choice of officers, directors, or
agents, and no right to the property except the right to receive a due proportion of the earnings of the association
while it exists, and a similar proportion of the property after
its dissolution.
It is true that the shareholder has no right to the possession of any part of the corporate property while the corporation exists and its affairs ar honestly managed. He has
committed his interest, for a time, to the possession and control of the corporation of which he is a member, and he has
only a member's voice in the management of it.
So a man who has leased a farm has no right to possession
or control during the lease; but who denies his property in
the farm? And if a dozen owners join in the lease, has not
each one an interest in the property to the extent of onetwelfth ?
So, if for the time the property of the shareholder is placed
beyond his direct control, and converted into property of the
association, how can that circumstance affect the intrinsic
character of his shares as shares of the whole corporate property? How can a man's shares of any property be the subject of valuation at all if not with reference to the amount
and productiveness of the property of which they are a part?
What value can they have except that given them by that
amount and that productiveness? A certificate of title to a
share is not a share. It is evidence of the shareholder's interest, His interest may be transferred by the transfer of

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

the certificate; but it is not the certificate that is valued
when the worth of the share is estimated either by the speculator in the market, or by the tax assessor. It is the property which it represents that is valued, by the speculator
often with reference to speculation only, but by the public
officer, always, if he does his duty, by the real worth of the
property, all things considered.
It is said, also, that the taxation of the shares by the
States was intended as part of the price of the privileges
granted to the associations by Congress, and especially for
the new use allowed to be made of the bonds by depositing
them as security for the redemption of the circulating notes
issued to the associations by the government.
But while we see privileges granted in the act to these
associations, in order that they may fulfil the public purposes of their organization, and while we see that these privileges may enhance the value of the capital invested and consequently the value of the shares, we see no tiew use allowed
to be made of the bonds. It has been common in many
States, of late years, to require banks of circulation to secure
prompt redemption by securities deposited with the State
officers, and among such securities preference is usually
given to bonds of the United States. Put this is for the
benefit and security of the note-holders, not of the banks.
The requirement restricts rather than increases the amount
of their circulation.
These privileges, moreovex, and the new use, if there be
one, are granted directly to the associations, and only indirectly to the shareholders; and if the right to tax is to be inferred from consent manifested by organization under the act,
the tax should be imposed on the capital of the associations
rather than upon the shares. And we may remark, also, that
the imagined new use is restricted to the limited amount of
bonds required as security for circulation, while the greater
part of the bonds, held by the associations, are not so pledge4
at all, and no such reason as new use or special privileges
can be alleged for denying exemption to them.
It is worthy of notice, that the banks of New York, whose

VAN ALLEN V. TIuE ASSESSOES.

[Sup. Ot.

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

claim to the exemption of the bonds held by them from
State taxation was held valid by the two decisions we have
cited, were organized upon the same principles with the national banking associations which now claim a similar exemption. The same privileges, substantially, were conferred
on those institutions by the laws of INew York as are conferred on these by act of Congress. The former were allowed to issue an amount of currency proportioned to the
bonds deposited by them with the bank superintendent, just
as the latter are allowed to issue an amount proportioned to
the bonds deposited by them with the treasurer of the United
States. If the tax is the price of privilege in the case of the
latter, so it must have been in the case of the former. If it
is a duty on the new use of bonds by national banking associations, it was a duty on the same new use by the New York
banks. If consent of the former to taxation could be inferred from organization, so could the consent of the latter.
And yet it was held, in the INew York bank cases, that the
tax could not reach the bonds which made a part of the capital, while it is now held that it may be imposed on the
shares of the capital invested partly or wholly in these bonds.
Surely no argument drawn from new use or price of privilege can be valid for the latter tax which was not valid for
the former.
The truth is, we think that Congress, when providing for
State taxation of shares, had no reference whatever to any
new use of bonds or any price of privilege. The national
legislature was engaged in providing a uniform currency for
the whole country, and for its circulation and redemption.
For this and other great national purposes the organization
of the national banking associations was authorized, and it
was expected that these associations would take the place
of the State banks, from taxes on which the States derived
considerable revenues. It was to remove the objections to
the new system, founded on the loss of this revenue through
the conversion of State banks into national associations,
that Congress authorized the taxation of shares by the
States. This taxation should be allowed to the extent of

Dec. 18G5.]

VAx

ALLEN v. Tnr, AssEssors.

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

the concession of Congress. That concession limits it to
the same taxation as the States impose on moneyed capital
in the hands of individuals, in whose hands the proportion
invested in national bonds is exempt. There is no reason
for extending taxation on shares beyond that concession.
But it is urged that other provisions in the act of Congress require that construction of the proviso which allows
taxation on shares without deduction of investments in national securities. We think otherwise.
One of these provisions is that which requires the capital
to be divided into shares of one hundred dollars each. This
provision only shows that, at the outset, each share of paid
up capital represented a property interest in the association,
bearing the same proportion to the whole that one hundred
dollars bore to the entire capital.
The only other provision much relied on as favoring the
construction of the majority, is that clause of the fortieth
section which requires the officers of the several associations
to keep correct lists of the names and residences of the
shareholders, subject to the inspection of shareholders and
creditors, and of the officers authorized to assess taxes under
State authority. But is it not obvious that this list would
be as useful to the State officers in valuing the shares with
exemption of bonds, as in valuing them without exemption ?
It is said that exemption would embarrass valuation. How?
All the assessor would have to do, would be to ascertain the
value of the whole property of the association and deduct the
amount of bonds. The remainder, divided by the number
of shares, would give the value of each share to be taxed.
And the assessor must value the whole property and divide
it by the number of shares, in order to make a true valuation
of shares. If he does not do this, he must assess the shares
at an arbitrary or speculative valuation. This is not what
is required. The laxv demands true valuation; and true
valuation, with deduction of bonds, places the shareholder
on exact equality with the holder of other moneyed capital,
which the law also demands. No other mode of valuation
secures that equality.

602

VAN ALLEN v. TE ASSESSORS.

[Sup. Ct,

Opinion of the Chief Justice and of 'Wayne and Swayne, JJ.

There is another provision of the act which appears to us
conclusive of the correctness of our view. It is that clause
of the 41st section which provides for taxation by the United
States. It imposes a tax of one per centum annually on
circulation; one-half of one per centum on deposits; and,
then, one-half of one per centum on the capital, beyond the
amount invested in United States bonds. Is it possible that
Congress observed so scrupulously the obligations of good
faith as to refuse to tax capital invested in bonds for nati,,nal
purposes, and this in the midst of war, and was yet so negligent of those obligations as to allow the same capita) invested in bonds to be taxed in shares, for State purposes?
Can it be supposed that Congress, having undoubted power
to tax national securities, refrained from exercising it because its exercise would be inconsistent with good faith, and
yet intended, by ambiguous phrases, and in the exercise
of questionable constitutional authority, to authorize such

taxation by the States who, without such authority, could
not impose it at all? Suppose that, by this clause, Congress
had imposed double the amount of tax actually assessed,
and had provided for the payment of half of it to the States.
That would have provided an indemnity to the States for
the loss of taxes on the State banks, and would have subjected the national bonds to no tax. Is it reasonable to
believe that Congress intended to adopt another mode of
indemnity, which, by indirection, would subject those bonds
to heavy taxation, and that by the States?
To us these questions seem to answer themselves. We
are entirely satisfied that the construction of the proviso
and the ruile for valuation of shares, which we have endeavored to vindicate, is the true one, and the only one consistent
with sound principle and perfect faith. We dissent, on this
point, from the majority of the court with reluctance; but
we are constrained to dissent.
We concur with the majority of the court as to the effect
of the second proviso.
The laws of New York, brought under review in the case
before us, provide for the taxation of the shares of the na-

tional banking associations, and for the taxation of the capital of State banks, but not of the shares; while the second
proviso of the act of Congress requires that the tax on the
shares of the former shall not exceed the tax on the shares
of the latter. It is clear that this taxation by the State is
not in accordance with the authority given by Congress.
The variance might not be a matter of much practical importance, if we agreed in opinion that taxation on capital
and shares must be by the same rule; but the application
of the rule of exemption, heretofore sanctioned, to the capital of the State banks, while the rule denying exemption,
which is now announced, is applied to the national associations, would work great and manifest injustice. We think,
moreover, that the second proviso is a substantive part of
the act which cannot be disregarded, and that it withholds
from States, whose policy does not allow the organization
