v. GOODYEAR.

Statement and opinion.

nor in continuation of that proceeding, the case was not one
proper for substituted service.* They were not bound to
appear. They entered their appearance specially, and appeared only to object to the jurisdiction of the court.
The learned judge who heard the case below was correct
in ordering the bill to be dismissed.
DECREE AFFIRMED.

BOURNE V. GOODYEAR.
A proceeding to vacate the extension of a patent, of which the extension has
expired before the proceeding was begun, has no equity to support it,
and cannot be sustained on demurrer.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Southern District
of New York, in which court, on the 15th of J une, 1865, a
proceeding was begun, in the name of the United States, ex
relatione Bourne, against the executor of Goodyear, to vacate
an extension of a patent. The bill showed that the extension of the patent sought to be vacated by the proceeding
expired on the 14th of June, 1865; before the suit was commenced, and the defendant demurred to it on that ground
among others. The court below dismissed the bill, and the
relator brought the case here.

Messrs. T. I. Parsons, A. Payne, and C. Gushing, for the
appellant; Messrs. E. W. Stoughton and W. E. Curtis, contra.
The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the Opinion of the court.
The extension having expired before the bill was filed,
there is no equity to support the application to set it aside.
The extension has ceased to be of any effect, and there remains nothing which can be the subject of a suit. The demurrer to the bill, therefore, must be sustained, and the
decree of the Circuit Court by which the bill was dismissed
must be
AFFIRMED.
