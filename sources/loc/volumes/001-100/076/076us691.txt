Syllabus.

MEADE V. UNITED STATES.
1. The claims of American citizens against Spain, for which by the convention (subsequently becoming the treaty) of February 22d, 1819, the
United States undertook to make satisfaction to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000 were such claims as, at the date of the convention, were
inliquidaed,and statements of which had been presented to the Department of State, or to the minister of the United States. And within
this class, on the said 22d of February, were the claims of the late
Richard W. Meade. And this was the only class that the commissioners appointed subsequently, on the ratification of the treaty, to pass upon
claims, had power to pass upon.
1
2. The convention, as signed February 22d, 1819, subject to ratification
within six months, though it was not ratified within the time stipulated, was never abandoned, though some expressions in the notification
of August 21st, 1819, by the United States to Spain (notifying to that
government that after the next day, "as the ratifications of the convention will not have been exchanged," all the claims and pretensions
of the United States will stand in the same situation as if that convention had never been made), indicated that the United States might be
induced to refuse to carry it into effect.
3. This notification did not, by the non-ratification within the six months,
make revocable the power which citizens of the United States, by filing
their claims with it, had given their government to make reclamations
against Spain in their behalf, nor did Mr. Meade in point of fact revoke
the power which he had so given his government.
4. Mr. Meade having subsequently to the appointment of commissioners
presented to thkm his claims, not in an unliquidated form, but in the
shape of a debt acknowledged by Spain in a judgment against it given
by a royal junta, or special judicial tribunal of that country, made after
the above-mentioned notification by the United States, the commissioners properly rejected the claims as thus made. They did not reject
his claims in their unliquidated form, and as filed previously to the convention, in the Department of State and with the American minister.
6. The fact that before the said commission rejected the claim of Mr. Meado
in the form in which he had presented it-the form, namely, of an
award or judgment by a Spanish tribunal for a sum certain-he requested the government of the United States to procure from the Spanish government his original vouchers and evidences of debt, under a
clause of the treaty which obliged the Spanish government to furnish,
at the instance of the said commissioners, all such documents and elucidations as might be in their possession for the adjustment of the unliquidated claims provided for by the treaty, does not, even assuming that
it shows that he meant to uresent his claims in an unliquidated form
show any cause of action against the United States over which the
Court of Claims could exercise jurisdiction.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.
6. The award of the tribunal of the Spanish government in favor of Mr.
Meade, made on the 19th May, 1820, was not, in that form, included by
the 5th article of the convention of February 22d, 1819, renouncing certain unliquidated claims then existing.
7. There having been no evidence in a finding of the Court of Claims that
an assurance, which that court found as matter of fact had been given
by the minister of the United States at the court of Madrid, to the
government of Spain, that a debt due by the last-named government to
Mr. Meade would certainly be paid, if a treaty whose ratification had
been suspended was ratified, and which treaty was afterwards ratified,
was given in pursuance of any instructions from the President or by
virtue of any authority from the United States, the said assurance is to
be regarded as having been given without authority, and therefore to
be held void.
8: This court does not agree with the Court of Claims in its opinion that, on
the facts found by it, the United States, by the acceptance of the treaty
of Spain of February 22d, 1819, and the cession of the Floridas, unincumbered by certain private grants, to a recognition of which as valid
our government had objected, appropriated the property of Mr. Meade,
and that he acquired a good claim against them for $873,879.88, for
which they were not liable legally and judicially except by and through
the investigation, allowance, and award of the commissioners appointed
under the treaty. But they do agree with that court in the opinion
that the decision of the commissioners, dismissing the claim in the form
in which it was presented to them, barred a recovery in the Court of
Claims on merits. And that the joint resolution of Congress of July
25th, 1866, referring the case back to the Court of Claims after it had
been once decided adversely to the claimant, was not a waiver of the
bar, and did not allow that court to consider it upon merits irrespectively of the dismissal by the commissioners.
9.'This court, in conclusion, expresses its regret, that entitled as Mr. Meade
clearly was to prove his unliquidated claims before the commissioners
he did not do so, and they observe that now the only remedy of his
representatives is by "an appeal to the equity of Congress."
APPEAL

from the Court of Claims.

The case was thus:

Richard W. Meade, of Philadelphia, a native-born citizen
of the United States, went to Spain towards the beginning
of this century, and became engaged extensively in commerce with that country. He was there during the invasion
of the French under Napoleon, and continued to reside there
until the year 1821. While so resident he entered into numerous contracts with the Spanish government after the
year 1802, and before the year 1819, which involved large

amounts of money, and his resources contributed to the
support of that government during its contests with the
French. By this means Spain became largely his debtor.
After the restoration of the King of Spain to the throne, Mr.
Meade was seized and imprisoned by order of the government, confined for a long period of time, and finally released
only by reason of the active interposition of the government
of the United States in his behalf. About the time of his
release our government and Spain were in negotiations in
regard to claims which citizens of the United States were
making upon Spain for wrongs done to them; in which
negotiations a cession of the region known as the Floridas
to the United States had been proposed. And on the 6th
June, 1818, Mr. Meade being then in Spain, addressed a
letter to Mr. Adams, our then Secretary of State, informing
him of a hint which he had received, that his just claims
against the government of Spain, and such further sum as
he might advance, might be satisfied by a cession of lands
in that region, and desiring to know whether this would
interfere with the designs of the United States. In reply to
this letter he was informed that no such cession would be
recognized if made after a certain date, to be fixed by the
contracting parties. Mr. Meade thereupon abandoned the
idea of getting satisfaction of his claim by a grant of land,
and there being now a prospect that a treaty would be made
in which all claims, including his own, would be provided
for, he submitted, January 17th, 1819, the claim to the Department of State "for that protection which his government
might think proper to grant." The claim, as sent by Mr.
Meade to the United States, showed an aggregate of near
$400,000.
On the 22d of February, 1819, a treaty was signed* between
the United States and Spain, by which the Floridas were
agreed to be ceded to the United States, we contracting that
all grants made therein by Spain, before January 24th, 1818
(the date when the proposal for cession was made), should be

confirmed to the persons in the possession; and both parties
agreeing that all grants made subsequently to that date
should be void. By the 9th article the two governments
reciprocally renounced
"All claims for damages or injuries which they themselves,
as well as their respective citizens and subjects, may have suffered until the time of signing this treaty."
In the same article (one which brought Mr. Meade's notices within the treaty), it was specified (Specification 5) that
this renunciation extended
"To all claims of citizens of the United States upon the Spanish government, statements of which, soliciting the interposition
of the government of the United States, have been presented to
the Department of State, or to the minister of the United States
in Spain, since the date of the convention of 1802. and until the
signature of this treaty."
The 11th article of the treaty opened as follows:
"The United States, exonerating Spain from all demands in
future on account of the claims of their citizens to which the renunciations herein contained extend, and considering them entirely
cancelled, undertake to make satisfaction for the same to an
amount not exceeding five millions of dollars."
It was agreed that there should be a commission "to
ascertain the full amount and validity of those claims;" such
commission to " hear, examine, and decide upon the same
within three years from the time of their first meeting."
And it was agreed further, that "the Spanish government
shall furnish all such documents and elucidations as may be
in their possession, for the adjustment of the said claims;
the said documents to be specified, when demanded, at the
instance of said commissioners."
The final ratification of this treaty was limited by its terms to
the 22d of August, 1819.
On the 10th of March, 1819, after the treaty had been
ratified by the United States, but before it was ratified by

UNITED STATES.

Statement of the case.

Spain, the .government of the United States notified to the
government of Spain that the article in the treaty which
provided that all grants of lands made by Spain in the
Floridas after the 24th of January, 1818, should be declared
null and void, "had been agreed to on the part of the United
States, with a clear understanding that it included certain
grants alleged to have been made, in the course of the preceding winter, by the King to the Duke of Alagon, the Count
Rostro, and a certain Mr. Vargas," and that the exchange
of ratifications must be "with a full and clear understanding" that these were " among the grants thus declared null
and void." In point of fact the grants which the United
States insisted were by the treaty declared null and void,
had been made prior to the 24th day of January, 1818 (the
date when the cession was proposed). And upon the notification given by our government, the government of Spain
refused to exchange ratifications, alleging that such declaration or understanding, with regard to the intent and meaning of the treaty, would "annul one of its most clear, precise,
and conclusive articles." And that government continued
to refuse to ratify the treaty until the 22d of August (the
limit of time provided for the ratification) had passed.
On the 21st of August, 1819, the United States notified
to Spain, that "after the 22d day of the present month, as the
ratifications of the convention of the 22d of February will
not have been exchanged, all the claims and pretensions of the
United States, which, with the spirit of moderation, the love
of peace, and the delusive expectation that all causes of difference and dispute with Spain would be thereby adjusted and
settled, they consented to modify or waive, will stand in the
same situation as if that convention had never been made."
After the notices above-mentioned had been given by the
United States to Spain, and after the time for exchanging
ratifications of the treaty of 22d of February, 1819, had expired, Mr. Meade proceeded to prosecute his several claims
before a royal junta of Spain,* which had been appointed to
* A special tribunal or commission, invested with judicial powers, under
the laws of Spain.

Statement of the case.

bear and determine his claims by the government of Spain,
at the solicitation and with the approval of the government of the
United States, expressed before the signing of the treaty of
22d of February, 1819. While the ratifications of the treaty
were held in abeyance, as already stated, Mr. Meade refrained from prosecuting his claims before this junta; but
after the notices given by the United States to Spain, to wit,
on the 31st of August, 1819, and at various times thereafter,
he appeared before the junta, and produced, under and in
presence of a decision thereof, all his original documents,
vouchers, and evidences of debt, and also evidence as to his
alleged personal injuries. And on the 19th day of May,
1820, the junta, with the approval of the King of Spain,
made a decree, by which it was adjudged that the government of Spain was indebted to him upon his claims and
accounts, and for interest on them down to the time of the
award, and for his personal injuries, in a sum in gross, given
in Spanish money, and equivalent, in the currency of the
United States, to $373,879.88. The King of Spain at the
same time approved, transmitted, and delivered to Mr. Meade
the formal certificate or evidence of such award, which was,
by the laws and customs of Spain, final and conclusive upon
the respective parties, and possessed all the solemnity and
verity of a judgment, and the record thereof, in courts of
the common law. Mr. Meade was, however, at the same
time, by the junta, required to, and did surrender to the government of Spain all his original documents, vouchers, and
evidences of debt establishing his claims. These were received by the Spanish government, "cancelled," and carried, in its fiscal department, to the various accounts to
which they respectively belonged, and were considered and
treated by that government as forever discharged and merged.
They were never restored to Mr. Meade, nor to his representatives. Immediately after the decree was rendered, the
government of Spain and Mr. Meade each duly notified it
to the government of the United States, which government
raised no objection t it, but, on the contrary, expressed its approval to both the government of Spain and to Mr. Meade.

MEADE V. UNITED STATES.

Statement of the case.

In addition to what immediately precedes (the first four
findings, in substance, of the Court of Claims), that court
went on to find, in terms, as follows:
Fifth.-After the award rendered by the junta, to wit, in
August, 1820, the government of Spain resumed the consideration of the treaty of 22d February, 1819, and of the demand
made by the United States, that the three certain private grants
of lands in the Floridas, made by Spain to her own citizens, not
included in the terms of the treaty, should be annulled. And
the Cortes of Spain, in which body was vested the sole constitutional power to annul such private grants or cessions, refused
to annul the same until the United States should agree to pay
and discharge in full the indebtedness of Spain to the said Meade,
upon the award of the royal junta. And thereupon the United
States, by their minister at the Court of Madrid, gave to Spain
"a clear and distinct assurance that the debt due to Richard W.
Meade would certainly be paid to him by the United States, if
the treaty were ratified by the Spanish government, and the
cessions (to the Duke of Alagon, and the Count Rastro, and Mr.
Vargas) totally annulled." And upon the faith of these assurances the Spanish government annulled such three private cessions, and duly ratified the said treaty, whereby the Floridas,
free of, and unincumbered by, these private grants, passed to
the United States. And the said Meade duly notified the gov-

ernment of the United States of the assurances given by their
minister, and that the Spanish government had acted upon the
faith thereof when annulling the private grants and ratifying
the treaty, which notice was duly received by the President,
and by him transmitted to the Senate while that body was considering the acceptance or re-ratification of the treaty. And the
United States, with full notice and knowledge of all the facts
and circumstances set forth in this finding, did, on the 19th of
February, 1821, accept and assent to the treaty, as ratified by
Spain, and became seized and possessed of the Floridas thereby.
Sixth.-And the said Meade, at the time the acceptance of
the treaty, as ratified by Spain, was under consideration in the
Senate, notified the United States that the award of the royal
junta was a good and valid certificate or evidence of indebtedness, and that he protested against the same being appropriated
by the United States, unless express provision should at the

same time be made for the full payment thereof by them exclusive of any provision which might be made for American
claimants, by the terms of the treaty. And he also requested
that such award held by him be expressly excepted and excluded
from any operation of the treaty, and that he be allowed to seek
the payment thereof from Spain. But the United States, on
the contrary, against the will and consent of said Meade, did
take and appropriate such indebtedness of the Spanish government, and did relinquish the same to Spain, and discharge and
release Spain from the payment thereof. And such claim, demand,
or award belonging to the said Meade, so taken and appropriated,
constituted and was in fact a part of the consideration paid by the
United States to Spain for the cession of the Floridas, and the sole
consideration paid to Spain by the United States for an annulment
of the three private grants.
The treaty being thus finally ratified, commissioners were
appointed in accordance with its terms. The findings of the
Court of Claims give the subsequent history of the case thus:
Seventh.-The said Meade, after the taking or appropriation of
his property or award by the defendants, as set fbrth in the sixth
finding, did demand payment therefor fr'om the defendants, but
was not paid; and, on the contrary, he was required to present
his demand to the commissioners appointed under and by virtue
of the terms of the treaty of 22d of February, 1819. And the
commissioners, upon such award or decree of the royal junta being
presented to them, did refuse to allow the same; and, on the contrary, did determine and decide that the only claims against
Spain which they had authority to investigate and allow were
claims existing prior to the date of the treaty of 22d of February, 1819, and that inasmuch as the award or decree of the royal
junta was subsequent to the date of the treaty, they had no authority to investigate or allow it; and the commissioners accordingly did, on the 29th day of May, 1824, reject and dismiss the
same.

The next finding had reference to a matter which made
another topic in the case. It was thus:
Eighth.-As soon as the commissioners notified the said Meade
of their determination to reject his demand for the payment of

Statement of the case.

his award by the royal junta, but before their final decision or
rejection of the same, he duly requested, to wit, on the 17th of
April, 1823, the defendants to procure from the Spanish government his original vouchers and evidences of' indebtedness described in the fourth finding; and the defendants accordingly did
request the Spanish government to furnish and transmit the
same to them. But the Spanish government did positively refuse to produce and deliver up such vouchers and evidences of'
indebtedness, upon the ground that the award of the royal junta
was a judicial decree, and final and conclusive upon the parties
by the laws and customs of' Spain, and that the said vouchers
were merged therein, and had been given up to and duly filed
and credited in the department of finance. And the Spanish
government did subsequently assure the defendants that such
cancelled vouchers would be given up as requested; but the
same never were so produced and given up, and have ever since
been and are still held by the government of Spain. And by
reason of such refusal and neglect on the part of' Spain to deliver up and surrender such vouchers, the commission never
considered or allowed the same, nor any portion of the demand
of the said Meade. And, on the contrary, the commission allowed the claims of other persons existing prior to the date of
the treaty, to an amount in the aggregate of $5,454,545.13.
And the defendants thereupon paid away upon such allowed
claims pro rata the sum of $5,000,000, being the whole of the
amiount provided by said treaty and the acts of Congress in furtherance for the liquidation thereof. And on the 8th of June,
1824, after making such awards, the said commission expired.
Being thus unable to proceed further in any way before
the commission, Mr. Meade brought the matter before Congress. It was steadily kept before the attention of that
body until the establishment of the Court of Claims. After
the establishment of the Court of Claims, 11th of February, 1856, the Senate, by resolution, referred the case to
that court for adjudication, and on the 17th of October,
1859, a decision was given (by a divided court) adverse to
the claim.
At that time the decisions of the court were reported to
Congress, and the claim went back and received the further

Statement of the case.

consideration of Congress. In 1863 the Court of Claims was
reorganized by an act of Congress,* which gave it jurisdiction over private claims against the government, "founded
upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an executive department, or upon any contract, express or implied,
with the government of the United States;" and subsequently
to this, Congress by a joint resolution reciting that doubts
were entertained whether the claim of the estate of Mr.
Meade was within a section of the said act, resolved "that
the said claim be and the same hereby is referred to the
Court of Claims for adjudication thereof, pursuant to authority conferred upon said court by any existing law to examine
and decide claims against the United States." The court
then heard the case anew, and in accordance with the rules
laid down by this court regulating appeals from the Court
of Claims,t made a finding which was meant to be a finding of facts, and reported also the conclusions in law of the
court upon them. The "finding of facts" is given in what
precedes. It purported to be made in accordance with the
rule of this court which should govern such finding, a rule
in these words:
"The facts so found are to be the ultimate facts or propositions which the evidence shall establish in the nature of a special verdict, and not the evidence on which these ultimate facts are
founded."
Upon the findings of fact as made by it the Court of
Claims, as a conclusion of law, decided:
1. That, by the acceptance of the treaty with Spain of 22d
February, 1819, and the cession of the Floridas, free of, and
unincumbered by, the thr ee private grants, the United States
took and appropriated the property of Mr. Meade, and that
he thereby, on the 19th of February, 1821, acquired a good
and valid claim against them for $373,879.88.
2. That the United States were not liable legally and judicially for such appropriation so taken for the public use,

except by and through the investigation, allowance, and
award of the commission appointed by the United States,
under and in pursuance of the treaty with Spain of 22d of
February, 1819, and that the decision of such commission
dismissing the same was final and conclusive upon the claimant, and bars a recovery upon the merits in this court.
3. That the joint resolution, 25th July, 1866, referring
back this case after the same had been once decided by the
former Court of Claims adversely to the claimant, was not
a waiver of the said bar, and did not allow this court to adjudge and decide the case upon the merits irrespective of
the decision and dismissal by the said commission.
And that judgment should be rendered herein fo' the defendants, and the petition be dismissed.
From this decree the representative of Mr. Meade took
an appeal here.
Messrs. Bradley.and Cushing, for the appellant:
I. Mr. Meade's submission of his claims upon Spain, to
the Department of State, on the prospect of a treaty's being
concluded, was not an absolute surrender by him to the government of those claims, nor when both the government of
Spain and the United States announced, in effect, that the
treaty proposed would never be ratified-in other words, that
there would be no treaty-was he bound forever from prosecuting his claims against Spain. When, therefore (1st), a
treaty was signed but provisionally-the power to ratify being
limited in point of time-and when (2d) Spain by refusing
to ratify within the time declared that she would not agree
,to the treaty, and when (3d and finally), on the 21st August
the United States notified to her that the expectation of a
treaty had proved a "delusive expectation," and that from
the next day "all the claims and pretensions of the United
States will stand in the same situation as if that convention
had never been made,"-a notification which she made operative by an acceptance of the situation-it cannot be doubted
that whatever authority had theretofore been given by Mr.
Meade to the United States, by filing his claims, became re-

MEADE V. UNITED STATES.

vocable by him. He now had a right, if he pleased, to prosecute his own claims in his own way.
The fact that new negotiations were entered upon afterwards, and that the treaty with a new construction of it, in
virtue of new considerations received by Spain-this being in
fact tantamount to a new treaty-was finally and years afterwards concluded, does not affect our position; nor in view of
the complete vacation of proceedings at the 23d of August,
would our position be affected even if the treaty had been
re-ratified, in its first sense. Mr. Meade's submission we
assume, therefore, became revocable.
II. It was actually revoked. Mr. Meade's act in submitting his claims to the tribunal created by Spain on his petition, and at the instance of the United Slales,-a submission made
after the expiration of the time limited in the convention for
the ratification thereof, and when there was no negotiation
between Spain and the United States for the resumption of
that convention,-when in point of fact, as is known,-though
this is no part of the findings and, therefore, not properly
spoken of, Spain had recalled her minister-and when, so
fir as anything appeared, there was no probability that the
treaty would be ratified by Spain-was an actual and complete revocation.
Mr. Meade accordingly accepted this condition of things.
And to a tribunal appointed by the Spanish government
"at the solicitation and with the approval of the United
States, expressed before the signing of the treaty," actually
organized before the signature of the treaty was known in
Spain, invested with judicial powers under the laws of Spain,
and which had been appointed to hear and determine his
claims on Spain, he submitted his claims, and by that tribunal the amount was adjudicated on the 19th of May, 1820.
When thus passed on and liquidated they were no longer
within the jurisdiction of the commissioners. Our Secretary
of State, Mr. Adams, has said: "If anything in human intention can be made clear by human language, it is that the
claims provided for by the above stipulation, were in the
condition as they had been exhibited at the time of the treaty;

that the authority and the trust of examining, ascertaining,
and deciding their amount and validity, was solely and exclusively committed to the commissioners."
le affirms that
Mr. Meade's claim, ifcomprised at all within the provisions of
the treal, was as an unsettled claim. But it was not unsettled
in any sense whatever, as he himself argued, and the commissioners had no jurisdiction over that subject-matter.
The claims which Mr. Meade had at the signing of the
treaty, diverse in character, uncertain in validity, and unsettled as to amount, had been merged in the final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction. Mr. Meade, in fact,
came before the commissioners, as the filndings show, only
because he was "required" to present his demand to them.
lie sought, as is plain by the findings, to make the government pay irrespectively of that commission. The fact that
when thus "required" to present his claim to the commissioners, he followed up his petition, and got from them an
order or call on Spain, under the treaty, to produce the
vouchers he had surrendered and which were cancelled,
cannot be availed of to support their jurisdiction. No consent of Mr. Meade could give it. The agreement of both
parties could not. The answer of Spain to that demand, as
set out in the eighth finding, was conclusive " that the award
of the royal junta was a,judicial decree, and final and conclusive on the parties by the laws and customs of Spain, and
that the vouchers were merged therein, and had been given
up to be duly filed and credited in the department of finance."
The commissioners decided that they had no authority to investigate or allow such a claim. They did not decide that
the petitioner had no case against Spain, or upon the fund
which they were to distribute under the treaty, but that they
had no power or authority to investigate or allow that claim;
that is to say, that they had no jurisdiction over the subjectmatter, and they were right.
In this state of things, the claim being formally established at the instance of our government, by the judicial
tribunals of Spain, and admitted under the most solemn act
as a debt due from Spain, but with no board constituted to

704

act upon it, the United States, "against the will and consent
of said Meade, did take and appropriate such indebtedness
of the Spanish government, and did relinquish the same to
Spain, and discharge and release Spain from the payment
thereof," they, by their minister at the court of Madrid
having given to Spain " a clear and distinct assurance that
the debt due to Richard W. Meade would certainly be paid
to him by the United States, if the treaty were ratified by
the Spanish government, and the three private cessions annulled;" and upon the faith of these assurances the Spanish
government having annulled these grants, ratified the treaty,
and ceded the Floridas to the United States, with an unincumbered title. All this was duly notified to the United
States; and " with full notice and knowledge of all these
facts and circumstances," on the 19th February, 1821, she
accepted and assented to the treaty as ratified by Spain, and
received the Floridas.
Did not this transaction take Mr. Meade's case out of the
operation of the treaty, even assuming that after the notice
of the United States to Spain, of the 21st of August, 1819,
and the award of the junta, it was not already outside of it?
And was not this appropriation of his debt so known and
admitted, made under an implied, if not an express contract
to make compensation therefor ?
But if the claim, in any form, after having passed into
judgment of the Spanish tribunal, was still within the class
of claims that the commissioners had a right to entertain,
how stands the case ? That Mr. Meade had a just original
claim against Spain no one denies. By the approval of his
own government he bad turned it into res judicata, and in
doing so had been "required" by Spain to give up to her
all the evidences of it. "Required" now by our own government to present his claim to our commissioners, and they
having no power to consider it otherwise than independently
of and anterior to the judgment of the junta, he calls on our
government to request from Spain, as in pursuance of the
treaty it secured a right to do, his original vouchers. His
purpose was plainly to present it in an unliquidated shape.

It was only for the "adjustment" of claims under the commission that the treaty gave a right to ask for these vouchers.
The request to have the vouchers, was in substance a presentation of it in this form. Our government does so call
on Spain for these vouchers, but from want of promptness,
or want of efficiency, or from her having made the term of
the commission too short, or from some other cause connected
with her own management or mismanagement of this part
of the thing, the commission expires before the vouchers are
obtained. The government had undertaken to act as agent
or attorney for Mr. Meade; to manage the whole matter;
and the time to prove the claim in the unliquidated form,
having, as that time was limited by the government, been
too short for her to do her duty in the premises, surely a
claim exists here for reimbursement in some other form.
The case falls within what is said by Lord Chancellor Truro
in De Bode v. The Queen.* "It is admitted law that if the
subject of a country is spoliated by a foreign government he
is entitled to redress through the means of his own government. But if through weakness, timidity, or any other cause
on the part of his own government, no redress can be obtained, then he has a claim against his own country." And
what is there unjust in this? The whole sum allowed by
the government ($5,000,000) has been absorbed by other
claims confessedly just. If Mr. Meade had another claim,
and a just one also, then it is plain that Congress, in appropriating but $5,000,000, appropriated a sum insufficient to
satisfy the just claims of American citizens, and should in
some way pay more.
III. Assuming, as the Court of Claims decides it was, that
independently of the joint resolution of July 25th, 1866, the
decision of the commissioners dismissing Mr. Meade's claim
was a bar to recovery upon merits in the Court of Claims,
that joint resolution was a waiver of the bar. Had the case
been referred in ordinary routine it would have probably
been no bar. But it went back by the special action of Con* 8 Clarke, House of Lords, 465.

gress, to whose members it was known as fully as to the
members of this court. There never was a case of which
Congress had so thorough a knowledge. Nay, Congress had
before them the decision of the Court of Claims dismissing
the case on this very ground. Must we say that that body
which established the Court of Claims for the ends of a great,
beneficent, and liberal j ustice, has specially waived the former
judgment of the Court of Claims and specially re-referred
the case, only that the court may report its former decision
and dismiss it upon a technical ground ? This would be to
interpose for the United States a defence which it has itself
withdrawn.
Mr. Hoar, Attorney-General, and Mr. Talbot, special eounsel
for the United States, contra:
L The case assumed by the other side, even if it were admitted to be true, does not establish the existence of an act
of Congress, a regulation of an executive department of the
United States, or a contract of the United States, express or
implied, calling for the payment, by the United States, of
the sum here claimed. Yet one of these three things must
be shown in order to the recovery of a judgment against the
government before the Court of Claims.
1. The treaty contains no such contract; its positive provisions exclude such. For, in the first place, the undertaking of the United States to make satisfaction for claims extended only "to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000," and
claims to that amount have been paid.
2. The same article which bound the United States to
payment also provided for the ascertainment of what should
be paid. Those claims were to be paid which the stipulated
commission should, within the stipulated term, determine
to be valid. Those, and no others; for the treaty was the
ultimate source, the first foundation, of the authority of the
commission, which was not the creature of mere statute.
Its term of office was not a statute term; it was a treaty
term. Not its term only, but also its determinations, derived
their authority from the treaty. This ends the whole case,
so far as obligations to pay are imposed by the treaty.

MEADE

v. UNITED STATES.

Argument for the United States.

3. Nor can a judgment of the Court of Claims find lawful
basis in the facts stated, as found by that court in the fifth
finding. The basis of this finding lies among public National acts-treaties between sovereigns-the construction
of which is conclusion of law, and not finding of fact, as in
transactions personal, and pertinent to the capacity of private parties. [The learned counsel then went into certain
public documents, particularly an official letter of Mr. Adams,
our Secretary of State, and some depositions to show that the
finding of the Court of Claims, as a finding of fact, was not
warranted.]
4. Nor does a taking of private property for public use
raise an implied contract for compensation which can be enforced in the Court of Claims. The obligation to compensate for such property, until expressly delegated, rests upon
the sovereign, upon Congress, and is not to be assumed by
any subordinate branch of the government.
II. The validity of the claim is urged on the ground that
the United States neglected to demand or to obtain in season
the evidence from Spain, and the right to recover seems to
be placed on the ground, that in respect to any claim which
the United States undertakes to conduct, they stand in the
relation of attorney to the client in the prosecution of that
claim, and are responsible for laches under precisely all the
stringent rules of common law applicable to the personal
relations of client and counsel. But the responsibility of
an attorney to his client is founded on the fact that the
attorney "undertakes to conduct" the business of his client
for pay and compensation, a method in which the United
States never undertakes to conduct, with foreign governments, the claims of its citizens. The United States, then,
never undertakes to conduct a case in the manner implied
by this proposition, and it falls to the ground for want of
facts to which it will apply.
Independently of all which the government is not responsible for the laches of its officers or agents.*

Reply in support of the jurisdiction.

Reply.-I. The government, it turns out, cannot stand upon
the findings of fact by the Court of Claims; especially not
upon the fifth one. Itis compelled to attack them, and to say
that that court when professing to find facts really made conclusions of law; and then it goes behind the findings to show
error in them. The weakness of the government case is disclosed at once. We deny that the fifth finding is not a finding of facts. Every finding which reports "ultimate facts,"
instead of reporting by prouts and in his verbis, the evidence
on which those facts rest, might be attacked as not being a
finding of fact.* Yet it is precisely this sort of facts, "ultimate facts," that this court, by its general rules, requires
the Court of Claims to find and send up to it, and for not
finding and sending up which, but for finding and sending
up instead the evidence of those facts-the sort of thing which
the government here argues should be sent up-that in
United States v. Johnsont this court returned the record to
the Court of Claims, in order to send things in a cleaner
form. This court wants a case, not the evidence from which
a case is made up. It has confidence in the ability of the
Court of Claims to find the facts; "a tribunal which," as it
declared in United States v. Adams,t " must, of necessity, inquire into them fully, and which having ample time, and
being otherwise every way competent, may be relied on to
state them truly." Certainly it will be conceded that every
one of the findings in the fifth finding may be a fact. And
when the Court of Claims finds each as a fact-finding afterwards, conclusions of law upon them all, as facts-those findings must, now and here, and while the ease is a hearing
upon the present record, be received as facts. If the government had any objection to the form of the finding, it should
have asked the court below to alter the form; or should now
ask this court to send it back, as was done in United States
v. Joh7ison,§ for a better shape. Unreformed it stands as a
finding of facts. And a rule of court makes such a finding
equivalent to a special verdict, the place of which it supplies.

Opinion of the court.

If the finding here were a special verdict in fact, would it
be tolerated that counsel should go behind it, and by letters
of Mr. Adams or Mr. Meade, or depositions, or diplomatic
notes, show that the jury had come to a wrong verdict?
Standing in the place of a special verdict it stands above attack, and even above criticism.
II. The United States received a valuable consideration
from Mr. Meade specifically, for all its engagements, including the one about vouchers. The surrender by Spain
of what it regarded as one of "the most precise, clear, and
conclusive articles," and the acquisition by the United States
of three large tracts of land, whose acquisition was a sine
qua non of a treaty, was this consideration. It was bound
by the highest obligations, therefore, to transact its business
efficiently.
The position that the United States, after having received
the price of great treaties stipulated for by its plenipotentiaries in dealing with foreign courts, may, with this price unreturned, disregard the engagement of those its high agents,
and say that because such officers had no direction to make
such stipulations, therefore that they, the government, will
not pay for what they have received, and are now enjoying,
is one that cannot have been well considered.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Private claims against the government of the United States,
founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation
of an executive department, or upon any contract, express
or implied, with the government, are within the jurisdiction
of the Court of Claims, as appears by the second section of
the act passed to amend the act establishing that court.*
Comprehensive as that provision is, still doubts were entertained whether the claim of the appellant was not excluded
front the jurisdiction of the court by the ninth section of the
amendatory act, but all doubt upon the subject was removed
by the joint resolution subsequently passed, by which Con* 12 Stat. at Large, 765.

Opinion of the court.

gress, in express terms, referred the claim to that court for
adjudication, to be examined and decided in the same manner as other claims against the United States under existing
laws.*

I. Pursuant to that authority the appellant, as the representative of the deceased claimant, presented his petition to
the Court of Claims, setting forth very fully the nature of
his alleged cause of action and the ground upon which he
claims to recover in this case. His ancestor, the decedent,
was a native-born citizen of the United States. Early in the
present century he went to Spain, and while resident there
became extensively engaged in commerce with that country.
le was there during the invasion of the French under Napoleon, and continued to reside there until the treaty of
amity, settlement and limits between Spain and the United
States was ratified by both parties. Throughout that period
he was constantly engaged in mercantile pursuits, and he
also entered into numerous contracts with the government
of that country, prior to the date of the treaty, by means of
which Spain became very largely his debtor.
Part of his claims consisted of fourteen unliquidated accounts for goods sold and delivered, and it also appears that
he was illegally arrested during that period, and that he was
imprisoned by the order of the government, for which wrongs
and personal injuries he also held large unliquidated claims.
Unable to regain his freedom from the unjust imprisonment
he sought the aid of the United States, and it appears that it
,was not until our government interfered that he was released
from his confinement. Both before and after the date of
'the treaty be invoked the aid of the government of the United
States in collecting his claims, as well those arising from contracts as those arising from unjust imprisonment and personal injuries.
Prior to the date of the treaty the claimant filed in the
office of the Secretary of State a notice of his claims against
that government, amounting, as he alleged, to four hundred
*

14 Stat. at Largo, 611.

Dec. 1869.]

MEADE V. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the court.

thousand dollars, and the finding of the court below shows
that the notice so filed was one of the notices referred to and
included in the treaty between the two countries. Reclamations were also made by many othdr citizens of the United
States upon Spain for wrongs and injuries suffered by them
through the acts or official orders of that government, notices of which were either filed in the State Department or
had been presented to the minister of the United States resident in that country. Questions of great magnitude also
touching treaty obligations previously contracted, the settlement of disputed territorial limits, and the cession of new
territorial possessions, were under diplomatic discussion between the plenipotentiaries of the two governments.
Pending these reclamations, and at a moment when the
state of the negotiations presented strong hopes that they
might terminate successfully, the claimant informed the Secretary of State that it had been intimated to him that if he
would advance a further sum of money to that government
he might procure a grant of lands in Florida sufficient to
cover the whole amount of his claims. Evidently his purpose was to ascertain whether such a grant, if made, would
be sanctioned and respected by the United States in case the
then pending negotiations should be successful and Florida
should be ceded to our jurisdiction.
II. Equal and ex::ct justice to all the claimants was what
our government was endeavoring to secure by the negotiations, and of course the suggestion received no encouragement whatever, as it contemplated a separate provision for
one, to the exclusion of the rest. On the contrary, the reply
of the Secretary was to the effect that if the treaty of cession
was concluded it would contain a provision that all grants
made after a given date, to be fixed by the contracting parties, should be null and of no effect. Influenced by that
reply be abandoned any further attempt to collect his claims
by procuring a grant of land and submitted the same to the
State Department "for that protection which his government may think proper to grant."
On the twenty-second of February, 1819, the treaty of

MEADE V.

UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

amity, settlement and limits was signed by the respective
plenipotentiaries of the two countries, and the Senate of the
United States ratified the same on the twenty-fourth of the
same month.*
All the territories which belonged to Spain, situated to
the eastward of the Mississippi, known by the name of East
and West Florida, were agreed to be ceded to the United
States in full property and sovereignty, the United States
contracting that all the grants of land made therein by Spain,
or by her lawfil authorities, before the twenty-fourth of
January, 1818, the date when the first proposal for the cession was made, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons
in the possession of the lands, to the same extent that the
same grants would be valid if the territories had remained
under the dominion of the former sovereign, but the contracting parties also stipulated, in the same article of the
treaty, that all grants made subsequent to that date "are
hereby declared and agreed to be null and void."
Animated with a desire of conciliation and with the object
of putting an end to all differences existing between them,
the contracting parties reciprocally renounced all claims for
damages which they themselves or their respective citizens
and subjects "have suffered until the time of signing this
treaty." Such claims for damages so renounced by the respective parties, on the one side or the other, were classified
in the ninth article of the treaty under different heads, but
it will not be necessary to refer to any of the classifications
with much particularity except to the fifth class renounced
by the United States, which releases all claims of our citizens "until the signature of this treaty," statements of
which soliciting the interposition of the government of the
United States have been presented to the Department of
State or to the minister of the Ufiited States subsequent to
the antecedent convention between the two countries.
Claims to which the described renunciation extends were
declared by the eleventh article of the treaty to be entirely
cancelled, and the United States contracted, not only to

Opinion of the court.

exonerate Spain from all demands in future on account of
such claims, but also "to make satisfaction to their citizens
for the same to an amount not exceeding five millions of
dollars." Subsequent demand by the United States for any
such claim was entirely prohibited, and the United States
also contracted to appoint three commissioners to ascertain
and adjudicate the full amount of all such claims, and the
stipulation was that the commisioners should receive, examine, and decide upon the amount and validity of all the
claims of citizens of the United States so renounced and cancelled. They were also authorized to hear and examine on
oath every question relative to the said claims, and to receive
all suitable authentic testimony concerning the same, and
the sovereign of Spain contracted to furnish all such documents and elucidations as were in the possession of that
government for the adjustment of the claims according to
the principles of justice, the law of nations, and the stipulations of the prior treaty between the contracting parties.
III. Viewed in the light of these several suggestions
nothing can be more certain than the conclusion that the
claims in question, at the time the treaty was signed, were
included in its provisions, and " that the authority and the
trust of examining, ascertaining, and deciding upon their
amount and validity were solely and exclusively committed
to the commissioners" to be appointed under the treaty.
Beyond question they were at that date unliquidated claims
of a citizen of the United States, statements of which, soliciting the interposition of our government, had not only been
presented to the Department of State, but also to the minister
of the United States, showing to a demonstration that the
claims of the ancestor of the appellant were within the very
words of the treaty.
Prompt action by the United States in ratifying the treaty
did not, however, have the effect to secure corresponding
promptitude on the part of the other contracting party.
Delay ensued, which for a time was wholly unexplained;
but it soon came to be understood that it arose from the fact,
that pending the negotiations three grants of large tracts of

MEADE V. UNITED

STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

land, situated in the ceded territories, had been made, which
our government regarded as null and void under the closing
provision of the eighth article of the treaty. Determined
not to protect those grants, the Secretary of State instructed
our minister to explain and declare, upon the exchange of
ratifications, that the exchange was made "with a full and
clear understanding between the plenipotentiaries of both
the highi contracting parties that these grants were among
the grants thus declared null and void."
On the receipt of that despatch Spain refused to ratify the
treaty, and, through her minister sent here for that purpose,
objected to that requirement as inconsistent with the treaty,
and he insisted that such a declaration, if made, would "tend
directly to annul one of its most clear, precise, and conclusive articles." Pending this discussion, the period fixed by
the treaty for the exchange of the ratifications expired; but
the United States notified the Spanish government the day
previous, that if the six months expired without such ratification they should hold themselves free to press and enforce their claims and pretensions in any and every mode
consistent with honor that their interests may require.
Confessedly, some of the expressions of that despatch indicated that the United States might, under some circumstances, be induced to refuse to carry the treaty into effect;
but they never made any such decision, and never did any
act or uttered a sentiment'which authorized the claimants
interested in its provisions to assume that they had come to
any such conclusion. Nothing of the kind was ever intimated by the minister sent here from Spain, and the correspondence which ensued shows conclusively that neither
party contemplated any such result. lie came for explanations; but he was told, before any reply was given to that
part of his communication, that the President wished to be
informed whether he was the bearer of the ratifications of
the treaty previously signed and committed to the charge
of our minister for that purpose. Obliged to answer that
inquiry in the negative, he found it necessary to give explanations in behalf of his own government before requiring

afiy from the United States. Reference is made to that correspondence to show that the treaty as signed was never
abandoned by either party, and nothing was ever given or
promised by the United States except what is therein stipulated to secure its ratification.
New articles to the treaty were not required by the new
minister, and he was emphatically told by the Secretary of
State that the United States could not, consistently with what
was due to themselves, stipulate any new engagements as
the price of obtaining the ratification of the old; that the
declaration which our minister was instructed to deliver at
the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty with regard
to the eighth article, was not intended to annul or in the
slightest degree to alter or impair the stipulations of that
article; that the only object in view was to guard his gov'ernment, and all persons interested in any of the annulled
grants, against the possible expectation or pretence that
those grants would be made valid by the treaty.
Although the Secretary of State informed the minister
sent here for explanations that the question of ratification
on the part of the United States must be again submitted
to the Senate, because the six months had expired, still he
insisted that it should be ratified by the other contracting
party without delay and without any alterations, showing
conclusively that the consummation of the arrangement was
both contemplated and desired.*
V. Power to annul the grants in question, or to declare
them null and void, as required by our government, it was
insisted by the Spanish negotiators, did not reside in the
King alone, that the consent of the Cortes must first be had
before the required declaration could be made; and it does
not appear that any attempt was made on the part of our
government to controvert that proposition. Further delay
necessarily ensued, but the consent of the Cortes was given
on the fifth of October, 1820, and on the twenty-fourth of
the same month Spain ratified the treaty without alteration
or amendment.
* 4 American State Papers, 683.

MEADE v. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Occurring, as these matters did, in the recess of the Senatb,
further action was necessarily deferred until the meeting of
Congress. By special message the President, on the thirteenth of February, 1821, informed the Senate that the rin-,
ister of Spain had given notice that he was ready to exchange
the ratifications of the treaty, and it appears that the Senate,
on the nineteenth of the same month, again consented to
and advised the President t6 ratify it, without making any
amendment to the same, or suggesting any qualification whatever to any of its provisions.*
Application had been made by the deceased claimant to
the government of Spain, before his claims were transmitted
to the State Department, requesting that the King would
appoint a commission to liquidate his claims; but, on the
seventeenth of January, 1819, when the prospect brightened
that a treaty would be concluded, he submitted his claims
to the Department of State " for that protection which his
government may think proper to grant."
No such commission was appointed until after the minister
who signed the treaty had been recalled, and the United
States had bee4 informed by his successor that his government regarded the declaration which our minister was instructed to exact, when the ratifications of the treaty should
be exchanged, as tending " directly to annul one of its most
clear, precise, and conclusive articles." Reluctant to make
the required declaration, Spain recalled her minister and
" suspended the ratification of the treaty;" and on the
seventh of May, 1819, she appointed the commission previously requested by the claimant, and it appears that the
commission in eleven days afterwards informed the claimant that they were prepared to receive his proofs and hear
his explanations.t
They, the commissioners, proceeded promptly to the discharge of their duties, and on the thirty-first of August following they notified the claimant to produce the documentary evidences to support his claims, and it appears that he,

Opinion of the court.

in the course of a few weeks, transmitted the originals to
the commission. Perfect success attended his efforts, as the
commission, with the express and fbrmal approval of the
King, on the nineteenth of May, 1820, made an award in
his favor for the sum of three hundred and seventy-three
thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine dollars and eightyeight cents, in our currency, which included his fourteen unliquidated contract claims, with interest to the time of such
liquidation; and also a sum in gross on account of his claims
for personal injuries.
Justice had been denied him for years, but it was now
promptly accorded in the award, and the finding of the court
below shows that the King at the same time approved a certificate of the award, in accordance with the laws and customs of the country, and delivered the same to the claimant
as conclusive evidence of the verity of the award. By the
fourth finding of the court below it also appears that the
United States was notified of that result, both by the government of Spain and by the claimant, and that the Secretary
of State expressed his approval of it to both parties. Five
days before the treaty was, the second time, submitted to
the Senate for their advice, the claimant addressed a memorial to the President, making known for the first time
what his pretensions were in the new aspect of his claim.
V. Briefly stated, they were to the effect that the Senate, if
the treaty should be submitted for ratification, should either
annex a new article recognizing his claim as expressed in the
award made after the treaty was signed, or, if that could not
be conceded, that the fifth renunciation should be explicitly
excepted from the ratification and expunged from the treaty.
Unless lie could have a distinct recognition of his claim,
he asked, as an act of justice, that the alternative request
might be granted, that he might "be left free to prosecute
the claim where it is unquestionably due, unembarrassed
with the imposing renunciation of my country." Stronger
language to express his convictions that his claim, as it existed when the treaty was signed, was included in the fifth
renunciation of the same, could not well be chosen than he

employed in that memorial, where he says that it is his "decided election to abide the issue of an appeal to the moral
sense and good faith of that nation rather than the chances
of that contingent and long-deferred indemnity provided for
the other claims into whose company mine has been introduced by the treaty."
Addressed, as the memorial was, to the President, he referred it to the Secretary of State for his opinion, and nothing
can be more conclusive as to the views of the Executive
than the report of the head of the State Department. By
the statement of the memorial itself, said Mr. Adams, it was
questionable to the Cortes and to the Minister of Finance
whether or not the claim was included in the renunciation
of the ninth article. If it was, said the secretary, the claimant will be entitled to the immunities stipulated by the treaty
and in the form provided by the same instrument; if it was not,
his resort is, as it originally was, exclusively to the Spanish
government, and the Cortes, in recognizing his claim, have
given directions for his payment. Both the memorial and
the report of the Secretary of State were communicated to
the Senate the next day after the treaty was transmitted for
the consideration of that body.
Authority to appoint commissioners was conferred upon
the President, as stipulated in the eleventh article of the
treaty, by the fourth section of the act of the third of March,
1821, and it is well known that they were duly appointed
and commissioned as therein required.*
They were duly organized, as required, and exercised the
functions of their office for the period of three years. During that time the claimant, as the finding of the subordinate
court shows, presented his claim to the commissioners as expressed in the award made by the Spanish commission, and it
appears that the commissioners of the United States refused
to allow the claim in that form. He was fully heard, but
they ruled and decided that the only claims which they had
authority to investigate and allow were claims existing prior
3 Stat. at Large, 639.

Dec. 1869.]

MEADE V. UNITED

STATES.

Opinion of the court.

to the date of the treaty, and that inasmuch as the award
presented was subsequent to the date of the treaty, they had
no authority to investigate or allow it; and it appears that
they accordingly rejected and dismissed the petition upon
the ground that the evidence produced was not sufficient to
establish the claim.
Plain as the decree of the commissioners is, it is not possible to misuinderstand their views. They held that all unliquidated claims of our citizens upon that government, staterients of which, soliciting the interposition of our government, had been presented to the Department of State, or to
the minister of the United States in Spain, since the fbrmer
convention and prior to the signature of the treaty, were
within their jurisdiction, but that liquidated claims or claims
of a subsequent date were not within theirjui'isdiction. Such
also were the views of the Secretary of State in his very able
despatch of the twenty-ninth of April, 1823, addressed to the
charg6 d'affaires from Spain.*
ie shows to a demonstration that the time of the signature, and not that of the ratification of either of the parties,
nor that of the exchange of ratifications, is expressly agreed
upon as the time, until which the claims and the statements
of them to the Department of State, or to the minister of the
United States in Spain, had been received, which claims
were, on the part of the United States, renounced by the
fifth renunciation.
His reasoning is, that it could not have been the intention
of the parties that they should renounce claims, or admit
statements of them, not known to the party assuming the
obligation at the time of contracting it; and the court here
entirely concurs in that construction of the article. Whatever claims, therefore, might arise, or whatever statements
of them might be made after the signature of the treaty, were
not within that provision, because they could not, with propriety, be provided for in any such stipulation.
Beyond all doubt it was unliquidated claims for which pro* Senate Document, Second Session, 18th Congress, 248.

Opinion of the court.

vision was made, and neither party contracted that the other
should determine their amount or validity, but the stipulation
on the part of the United States was, that three commissioners should be appointed by the President, by and with
the advice arid consent of the Senate, and that the commissioners should determine the amount and validity of all such
claims of our citizens.
Examined in the light of these suggestions we concur in
the views of Mr. Adams, as expressed in that despatch, that
"if anything in human intention can be made clear by human
language, it is, that the claims provided for by the above
stipulation were in the condition, as they had been exhibited,
at the time of the treaty."*
VI. Transactions between the claimant and the government of' Spain,'subsequent to the signature of the treaty,
could not be evidence to the commissioners of the condition
of the claim at the time of that signature, and for that reason
the court is of the opinion that the decision of the commissioners rejecting the claim, as expressed in that award, was
correct. They did not reject the unliquidated claims of the
appellant, as filed in the State Department, nor as presented
to our minister in Madrid before the treaty was signed.t
Unambiguous as the decision of the commissioners is, there
is no reason to suppose that the claimant was misled even
for a moment. ie knew that he had a right to present his
claims to the commissioners as they existed at the time the
treaty was sigiied, but he elected to stand upon the claim as
it was expressed in the award, and he must abide the result,
as in the opinion of this court the decision of the commissioners that the award was not within the stipulations of the
treaty is correct.
Suppose all the preceding suggestions are correct, still the
claimant insists that the judgment must he reversed on account of what appears in the fifth finding of the court. Unexplained the court below there find as follows: (1.) That
the Cortes refused to annul the three grants in question until

Opinion of the court.

the United States should agree to pay and discharge in full
the indebtedness of Spain to the deceased claimant, as recognized in the award of the Spanish commission. (2.) That the
United States, by their minister at the court of Madrid, gave
to Spain "a clear and distinct assurance that the debt due
to the claimant would certainly be paid to him by the United
States if the treaty was ratified, and the said grants were
totally annulled." (3.) That the Spanish government, upon
the faith of those assurances, annulled the grants and ratified
the treaty. (4.) That the claimant duly notified the government of the United States of these facts, and of the assurances so given by our minister, and that the notice was duly
received by the President, and was by him communicated to
the Senate, at the same time that the advice of that body was
asked, the second time, as to the ratification of the treaty.
(5.) That the United States, with full notice and knowledge
of all the facts and circumstances set forth in that finding,
did accept and assent to the treaty as ratified by Spain, and
became seized and possessed of the ceded territories.
Without stopping to show that the findings are contradicted by the testimony of our minister, or that they are improbable in themselves, or that they are unsupported by any
satisfactory evidence, we proceed at once to remark that the
claimant is entitled to the full benefit of the rule that the
facts found in the court below are to be regarded as in the'
nature of a special verdict. Grant all that, still the findings
are subject to many criticisms.
By what means did the court become judicially informed
that the Cortes refused to annul the grants in question until
the United States should agree to pay and discharge in full
the award held by the claimant? Oral proof to that effect
could hardly be obtained which would be of a satisfactory
character, and if proof of that kind was not introduced, then
the inquiry arises: Upon what'evidence does the finding rest?
Legislative bodies usually act by decree, resolution, order,
or vote, but nothing of the kind is referred to as existing in
this case.. Depositions of two witnesses were introduced to
show that our minister gave the assurances specified in the
VOL. IX.

finding, but he states in his deposition that he does not remember that he ever gave any such assurances, and there is
no reason to conclude that he ever intended to enter into any
contract upon that subject. Who knows that the government of Spain in deciding to annul those grants acted upon
the faith of the assurances given by our minister that the
claims of the ancestor of the appellant would be paid in full,
as expressed in the award made long after the treaty was
signed; and if no one is able to give testimony to that effect,
by what means was the conclusion formed? Tested by these
or any similar considerations it is easy to see that the several
conclusions'embraced in the fifth finding are conclusions of
law rather than conclusions of fact, as they depend mainly,
if not entirely, upon the construction of public acts, diploinatic despatches, and treaty stipulations.
Regarded in that light the finding of the court below may
be re-examined here on appeal, but it is not neccs.sary to
rest the decision in this case upon that ground, as by the
very terms of the finding it appears that the assurances which
it is supposed misled theCortes were given by our minister,
and there is no evidence whatever that in giving the assurances he acted in pursuance of any instructions from the
President or by virtue of any authority from the United
States. Negotiations are usually conducted under instructions from the President, and the provision of the Constitution is that 1'he (the President) shall have power, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties,
provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur."
Such an assurance as that supposed could not be given by
any minister of the United States, except upon the condition
that it should become a treaty stipulation, and as such be
subject to the approval of the President and be ratified by
the Senate, as required by the Constitution.
Even if the finding had any foundation in fact, it is clear
that the act of our minister in giving the assurances was
wholly without authority, and that the act was null and void,
which must have been known to the Spanish government
and to the claimant.

Opinion of the court

VII. Examination will next be made of certain other coinplaints made by the appellant, as exhibited in the eighth
finding of the court below. The substance of that finding
is as follows: (1.) That the claimant, on the seventh of
April, 1823, and before the commissioners under the treaty
rejected his claim as founded uponi the award, requested the
United States to procure from the Spanish government his
original vouchers and evidences of indebtedness; that the
United States made the demand as requested, but that the
Spanish government positively refused to comply with the
request, upon the ground that the award was a judicial decree and was final and conclusive. (2.) That the Spanish
government did subsequently assure the United States that
the vouchers and documents would be given up, but that
the same never were produced, and have ever since been,
and still are, withheld. (3.) That by reason of such refusal
and neglect on the part of Spain, the commissioners never
considered or allowed his claim ; that they allowed the claims
of other persons, existing prior to the treaty, to an amount
greater in the aggregate than the five million dollars provided by the treaty, and that the commission, after making
those awards, expired.
Regarded in the most favorable light, the facts stated in
the finding do not show any ground of action against the
United States: (1.) Because it appears that the claimant
never presented to the commissioners his unliquidated claims
as they were filed in the State Department, or as they existed
at the time the treaty was signed. (2.) Because the finding
does not show that he ever intended to present his claims
in thatform to the commissioners, nor that he was prevented
from so doing by the neglect and refusal of that government
to produce his original vouchers and documents. (3.) That
even if the finding did show that he intended to present his
claims in that form, and that he, was injured by the alleged
neglect and refusal, still the admission would not benefit the
appellant, as the finding, with that admission superadded,
would not show any cause of action against the United States
within the acts of Congress conferring jurisdiction upon the

MEADE V.

UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Court of Claims, as it would not show a claim founded upon
any law of Congress or upon any regulation of an executive
department, nor any claim founded upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States.
VIII. Some consideration must also be given to certain
general propositions submitted by the appellant as tending
to bring his case within the scope of an implied contract.
1. He contends that the United States had no power to
release Spain from her obligations due to the ancestor of
the appellant, without his assent, except upon the condition
of making him just compensation for his claims.
Special examination of that topic or of its conditions and
qualifications is not necessary, as the case before the court
comes within the rule, as conceded by the appellant, as his
ancestor did submit his claims to the Department of State
for that protection which his government might think proper
to grant; and the finding of the court below is that the claimant, both before and after the date of the treaty, did invoke
the aid of the United States in collecting his claims, both
those arising on contracts and those arising from personal
injuries.*
2. Attempt is also made to maintain the proposition that
the power which the claimant gave to the United States to
make reclamations in his behalf became revokable by him
after the six months fixed by the treaty for the exchange of
the ratifications had expired, but the proposition is wholly
inadmissible, as the effect would be that whenever any such
misunderstanding should arise between the contracting parties, the negotiations might be controlled by a single claimant having some pecuniary interest in the treaty.
3. Next suggestion is that the act of the claimant in submitting his claims to the Spanish commission operated as a
full and complete revocation of the power he previously
granted to the United States to adjust his claims, but the
proposition is even less defensible than the preceding one,

Opinion of the court.

as it would enable one of the contracting parties, by making
terms with a citizen of the other party, to avoid the obligation of fulfilling a treaty stipulation.
4. Remark upon the sixth finding of the court does not
seem to be necessary, as what has been said in response to
the fifth finding furnishes a full answer to every deduction
made from it by the claimant. This award was made long
after the treaty was signed, and the claim in that form never
was included in the fifth renunciation. In his memorial he
requested that a new article might be added to the treaty,
making provision for the payment of his claim as expressed
in the award, or that the fifth renunciation might be expunged, but the request was not granted, nor could it have
been in the alternative form without defeating, in all probability, the whole arrangement.
Entitled as the claimant clearly was to prove his unliquidated claims before the commissioners, it is much to be regretted that he did not seasonably come to the conclusion
to adopt that course and avail himself of the plain right secured to him by the treaty. His error in that behalf increased
the equation to other claimants, and now his only remedy is
by an appeal to the equity of Co~ngress.
Under the circumstances one or two observations upon
the conclusions of law certified by the court below will be
sufficient. We do not concur in the first nor the second
finding, except that part of it where the court say that the
decision of the commissioners appointed by the United
States dismissing the claim ,was final and conclusive, and
bars a recovery upon the merits in that court. We concur
also in the third conclusion of law, and direct that the judgment be
AFFIRMED.

Mr. Justice BRADLEY had not taken his seat upon the
Bench when this judgment was given; and the case was
argued February 28th and March 1st, 1870, before Mr. Justice STRONG had taken his seat.
