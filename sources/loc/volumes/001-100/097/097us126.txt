Apply that principle to the case before court, and it is clear
that the knife in the respondents' machine, when considered
in connection with the striker, is substantially the same thing
as the cutter in the machine of the complainants when put in
operation by the means employed to raise it and let it fall to
perform the cutting function, without which the machine would
be of no value.
Tested by these considerations, it is clear that the decree of
the Circuit Court is erroneous, even if the construction of the
patent is that which the respondents assume it to be, as they
do not contend that the claim for the cutter used by the complainants, as embodied in the first claim of their patent, is
invalid.
The decree will be reversed, and the cause remanded with
directions to enter a decree in favor of the complainants, and

ELIZABETH v. PAVEMENT COMPANY.
1. A foreign patent or publication describing an invention, unless published anterior to the making of the invention or discovery secured by letters-patent
issued by the United States, is no defence to a suit upon them.
2. The presumption arising from the oath of the applicant that he believes himself to be the first inventor or discoverer of the thing for which he seeks
letters-patent remains until the contrary is proved.
3 The use of an invention by the inventor, or by persons under his direction, if made in good faith, solely in order to test its qualities, remedy
its defects, and bring it to perfection, is not, although others thereby
derive a knowledge of it, a public use of it, within the meaning of
the patent law, and does not preclude him from obtaining letters-patent
therefor.
4 Samuel Nicholson having, in 1847, invented a new and useful improvement
in wooden pavements, and fied in the Patent Office a caveat of his invention, put down in 1854, as an experiment, his wooden pavement on a street
in Boston, where it was exposed to public view and travelled over for
several years, and it proving successful, he, Aug. 7, 1854, obtained letterspatent therefor. Held, 1. That there having been no public use or sale
of the invention, he was entitled to such letters-patent. 2. That they
were not avoided by English letters-patent for the same invention, enrolled
in 1850.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mir. A. Q. Keasbey and Mr. Charles F. Blakce for the appellants.
1ir. Clarence A. Seward and Mr. B. Williamson, contra.
Mnr. JusricE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought by the American Nicholson Pavement Company against the city of Elizabeth, N. J., George W.
Tubbs, and the New Jersey Wood-Paving Company, a corporation of New Jersey, upon a patent issued to Samuel Nicholson, dated Aug. 20, 1867, for a new and improved wooden
pavement, being a second reissue of a patent issued to said
Nicholson Aug. 8, 1854. The reissued patent was extended in
1868 for a farther term of seven years. A copy of it is appended to the bill; and, in the specification, it is declared that
the nature and object of the invention consists in providing a
process or mode of constructing wooden block pavements upon
a foundation along a street or roadway with facility, cheapness,
and accuracy, and also in the creation and construction of such
a wooden pavement as shall be comparatively permanent and
durable, by so uniting and combining all its parts, both superstructure and foundation, as to provide against the slipping of
the horses' feet, against noise, against unequal wear, and against
rot and consequent sinking away from below. Two plans of
making this pavement are specified. Both require a proper

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT CO.

[Sup. Ct.

foundation on which to lay the blocks, consisting of tarredpaper or hydraulic cement covering the surface of the road-bed
to the depth of about two inches, or of a flooring of boards or
plank, also covered with tar, or other preventive of moisture.
On this foundation, one plan is to set square blocks on end
arranged like a checker-board, the alternate rows being shorter
than the others, so as to leave narrow grooves or channel-ways
to be filled with small broken stone or gravel, and then pouring
over the whole melted tar or pitch, whereby the cavities are all
filled and cemented together. The other plan is, to arrange the
blocks in rows transversely across the street, separated a small
space (of about an inch) by strips of board at the bottom, which
serve to keep the blocks at a uniform distance apart, and then
filling these spaces with the same material as before. The
blocks forming the pavement are about eight inches high.
The alternate rows of short blocks in the first plan and the
strips of board in the second plan should not be higher than
four inches. The patent has four claims, the first two of which,
which are the only ones in question, are as follows : "I claim as an improvement in the art of constructing pavements:
" 1. Placing a continuous foundation or support, as above described, directly upon the roadway; then arranging thereon a series
of blocks, having parallel sides, endwise, in rows, so as to leave a
continuous narrow groove or channel-way between each row, and
then filling said grooves or channel-ways with broken stone, gravel,
and tar, or other like materials.
"2. I claim the formation of a pavement by laying a foundation
directly upon the roadway, substantially as described, and then employing two sets of blocks: one a principal set of blocks, that shall
form the wooden surface of the pavement when completed, and an
auxiliary set of blocks or strips of board, which shall form no part
of the surface of the pavement, but determine the width of the
groove between the principal blocks, and also the filling of said
groove, when so formed between the principal blocks, with broken
stone, gravel, and tar, or other like material."
The bill charges that the defendants infringed this patent by
laying down wooden pavements in the city of Elizabeth, N. J.,

Oct. 1877.]

ELIZABETH'V. PAVEMENT CO.

constructed in substantial conformity with the process patented,
and prays an account of profits, and an injunction.
The defendants answered in due course, admitting that they
had constructed, and were still constructing, wooden pavements
in Elizabeth, but alleging that they were constructed in accordance with a patent granted to John W. Brocklebank and
Charles Trainer, dated Jan. 12,1869, and denied that it infringed
upon the complainant.
They also denied that there was any novelty in the alleged
invention of Nicholson, and specified a number of English and
other patents which exhibited, as they claimed, every substantial and material part thereof which was claimed as new.
They also averred that the alleged invention of Nicholson
was in public use, with his consent and allowance, for six years
before he applied for a patent, on a certain avenue in Boston
called the Mill-dam; and contended that said public use worked
an abandonment of the pretended invention.
These several issues, together with the question of profits,
and liability on the part of the several defendants to respond
thereto, are the subjects in controversy before us.
We do not think that the defence of want of novelty has
been successfully made out. Nicholson's invention dates back
as early as 1847 or 1848. He filed a caveat in the Patent
Office, in August, 1847, in which the checker-board pavement
is fully described; and he constructed a small patch of pavement of both kinds, by way of experiment, in June or July,
1848, in a street near Boston, which comprised all the peculiarities afterwards described in his patent; and the experiment
was a successful one. Before that period, we do not discover
in any of the forms of pavements adduced as anticipations of
his, any one that sufficiently resembles it to deprive him of the
claim to its invention. As claimed by him, it is a combination
of different parts or elements, consisting, as the appellant's
counsel, with sufficient accuracy for the purposes of this case,
enumerates them, 1st, of the foundation prepared to exclude
moisture from beneath; 2d, the parallel-sided blocks; 3d, the
strips between these blocks, to keep them at a uniform distance
and to create a space to be filled with gravel and tar; and, 4th,
the filling. Though it may be true that every one of these eleVOL. VII.

[Sup. Ct.

ments had been employed before, in one kind of pavement or
another, yet they had never been used in the same combination
and put together in the same manner as Nicholson combined
and arranged them, so as to make a pavement like his. The
one which makes the nearest approach to it, and might, perhaps, be deemed sufficiently like to deprive Nicholson of the
merit of invention, is that of John Hosking, which, in one
form, consisted of alternate rows of short and long blocks, the
latter partially resting on the former by their being mutually
rabbeted so as to fit together. The spaces thus formed between
the longer blocks, and on the top of the shorter ones, were filled
with loose stone and cement or asphalt, substantially the same
as in Nicholson's pavement. It would be very difficult to
sustain Nicholson's patent if Hosking's stood in his way. But
the only evidence of the invention of the latter is derived from
an English patent, the specification of which was not enrolled
until March, 1850, nearly two years after Nicholson had put
his pavement down in its completed form, by way of experiment, in Boston. A foreign patent, or other foreign printed
publication describing an invention, is no defence to a suit upon
a patent of the United States, unless published anterior to the
making of the invention or discovery secured by the latter,
provided that. the American patentee, at the time of making
application for his patent, believed himself to be the first
inventor or discoverer of the thing patented. He is obliged to
make oath to such belief when he applies for his patent; and it
will be presumed that such was his belief, until the contrary is
proven. That was the law as it stood when Nicholson obtained
his original patent, and it is the law still. Act of 1836, sects.
7, 15; Act of 1870, sects. 24, 25, 61; Rev. Stat., sects. 4886,
4887, 4920; and see Curtis, Patents, sects. 375, 375 a. Since
nothing appears to show that Nicholson had any knowledge
of Hosking's invention or patent prior to his application
for a patent in March, 1854, and since the evidence is very
full to the effect that he had made his invention as early as
1848, the patent of Hosking cannot avail the defence in this
suit.
It is unnecessary to make an elaborate examination of the
other patents which were referred to for the purpose of showing

Oct. 1877.]

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT CO.

an anticipation of Nicholson's invention. They are mostly
English patents, and we will only advert in a summary way to
such of them as seem to be most nearly relevant to the question
in controversy, premising that in England the enrolment of the
specification is the first publication of the particulars of a
patented invention.
Stead's patent, enrolled in November, 1888, shows a plan of
pavement consisting of a series of hexagonal, triangular, or
square-sided blocks, standing close together on the surface of
the roadway, in a layer of sand, and being a little smaller at
the bottom than at the top, so as to admit a packing of sand,
or pitch and sand, in the interstices between them, below the
surface. Small recesses at the top, around the edges of the
blocks, are suggested, apparently for giving a better hold to
the horses' feet. It had no prepared foundation like Nicholson's, and no spaces filled with gravel, &c.
Parkins's patent, enrolled October, 1889, proposes a pavement
to consist of blocks leaning upon each other, and connected
together with a mixture of sand and bitumen, and connected by
keys laid in grooves, and having grooves cut in the surface,
either across the blocks or along their edges, to give the horses
a better foothold. This plan exhibits no spaces to be filled
with gravel or other filling.
Wood's patent, enrolled in April, 1841, shows a pavement
made of adjoining blocks fitted together, but alternately larger
and smaller at the top, like the frustrum of a pyramid, and not
parallel-sided; those larger at the top standing slightly higher
than the others, so that when pounded down, or pressed by
rollers or loaded vehicles, they would act as wedges, binding
the whole pavement more tightly together. No filling is used
on the surface, and no prepared foundation is suggested. In
one form of his pavement he describes continuous grooves, the
grooves being formed of blocks which are shorter than the
others; and states that the groove is to be filled with concrete,
coal-tar, &c., mixed with gravel or sand: but there is no
foundation described for the pavement; and the description
given for laying down the pavement, viz. by ramming down
the taller blocks after considerable surface has been covered
by the pavement, shows that the road-bed on which the blocks

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT 00.

[Sup. Ct.

are to be laid is to be a yielding one, capable of conforming
itself to the under surface of the blocks in the same way as
sand does to the ordinary stone pavement when the stones are
rammed.
Perring's patent, enrolled January, 1843, shows a pavement
consisting, in one form, of blocks leaning one upon another in
rows, with strips of board between the rows, coming to within
an inch or so of the top of the pavement, and the same distance
from the bottom, leaving gutters for the water underneath, and
the adjoining rows being connected with pins passing through
the strips of board. The rows are thus separated to enable the
horses' feet to get a better hold. No filling is suggested, and,
indeed, would not be admissible, as the boards have no support
but the pins; and no prepared foundation is required.
Crannis & Kemp's patent, enrolled Aug. 21, 1843, presents,
amongst other things, first, a pavement consisting of rows of
blocks adjoining each other, but each block having a small
recess on one side, on the surface, to enable the horses to get a
better foothold ; secondly, a pavement of alternate blocks
adjoining each other, but differing in width, and slightly differing in height, the top of one block being rounded off so as to
make a groove next to the adjoining blocks, and the rounded
blocks in one row alternating with the rectangular-topped blocks
in the next row, the object of rounding off the alternate
blocks being to give a foothold to the horses. This pavement
is to be built on a flooring of plank, either of one or two thicknesses, but without any preparation to exclude moisture, and it
has no filling in the depressions or grooves formed by rounding
the alternate blocks.
A French patent, granted to Hediard in 1842, shows a pavement constructed of rows of blocks laid on a board foundation,
cemented together by a thin filling (four-tenths of an inch
thick) of cement or mastic, from top to bottom; no provision
being made to prevent the accession of moisture from the
ground below, and no strips between the rows to keep them
separate from each other.
None of these pavements combine all the elements of Nicholson's, much less a combination of those elements arranged
and disposed according to his plan. We think they present

Oct. 1877.]

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT

CO.

no ground for invalidating his patent, and no defence to this
suit.
The next question to be considered is, whether Nicholson'n
invention was in public use or on sale, with his consent and
allowance, for more than two years prior to his application for
a patent, within the meaning of the sixth, seventh, and fifteenth
sections of the act of 1836, as qualified by the seventh saction
of the act of 1839, which were the acts in force in 1854, when
he obtained his patent. It is contended by the appellanto that
the pavement which Nicholson put down by way of experiment,
on Mill-dam Avenue in Boston, in 1848, was publicly used for
the space of six years before his application for a patent, and
that this was a public use within the meaning of the law.
To determine this question, it is necessary to examine the
circumstances under which this pavement was put down, and
the object and purpose that Nicholson had in view. It is perfectly clear from the evidence that he did not intend to abandon his right to a patent. He had filed a caveat in August,
1847, and he constructed the pavement in question by way of
experiment, for the purpose of testing its qualities. The road
in which it was put down, though a public road, belonged to
the Boston and Roxbury Mill Corporation, which received toll
for its use; and Nicholson was a stockholder and treasurer of
the corporation. The pavement in question was about seventyfive feet in length, and was laid adjoining to the toll-gate and
in front of the toll-house. It was constructed by Nicholson at
his own expense, and was placed by him where it was, in order
to see the effect upon it of heavily loaded wagons, and of varied and constant use; and also to ascertain its durability, and
liability to decay. Joseph L. Lang, who was toll-collector for
many years, commencing in 1849, familiar with the road before
that time, and with this pavement from the time of its origin,
testified as follows: "Mr. Nicholson was there almost daily,
and when he came he would examine the pavement, would
often walk over it, cane in hand, striking it with his cane, and
making particular examination of its condition. He asked me
very often how people liked it, and asked me a great many
questions about it. I have heard him say a number of times
that this was his first experiment with this pavement, and he

EUIZABETH V. PAVEMENT

C0.

[Sup. Ct.

thought that it was wearing very well. The circumstances
that made this locality desirable for the purpose of obtaining a
satisfactory test of the durability and value of the pavement
were: that there would be a better chance to lay it there; he
would have more room and a better chance than in the city;
and, besides, it was a place where most everybody went over it,
rich and poor. It was a great thoroughfare out of Boston. It
was frequently travelled by teams having a load of five or six
tons, and some larger. 'As these teams usually stopped at the
toll-house, and started again, the stopping and starting would
make as severe a trial to the pavement as it could be put to."
This evidence is corroborated by that of several other witnesses in the cause; the result of the whole being that Nicholson merely intended this piece of pavement as an experiment,
to test its usefulness and durability. Was this a public use,
within the meaning of the law?
An abandonment of an invention to the public may be
evinced by the conduct of the inventor at any time, even within
the two years named in the law. The effect of the law is, that
no such consequence will necessarily follow from the invention being in public use or on sale, with the inventor's consent and allowance, at any time within two years before his
application; but that, if the invention is in public use or on sale
prior to that time, it will be conclusive evidence of abandonment, and the patent will be void.
But, in this case, it becomes important to inquire what is
such a public use as will have the effect referred to. That the
use of the pavement in question was public in one sense cannot
be disputed. But can it be said that the invention was in public use? The use of an invention by the inventor himself, or
of any other person under his direction, by way of experiment,
and in order to bring the invention to perfection, has never
been regarded as such a use. Curtis, Patents, sect. 881; Shaw
v. Cooper, 7 Pet. 292.
Now, the nature of a street pavement is such that it cannot
be experimented upon satisfactorily except on a highway, which
is always public.
When the subject of invention is a machine, it may be tested
and tried in a building, either with or without closed doors.

Oct. 1877.]

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT CO.

In either case, such use is not a public use, within the meaning
of the statute, so long as the inventor is engaged, in good faith,
in testing its operation. He may see cause to alter it and improve it, or not. His experiments will reveal the fact whether
any and what alterations may be necessary. If durability is
one of the qualities to be attained, a long period, perhaps years,
may be necessary to enable the inventor to discover whether
his purpose is accomplished. And though, during all that
period, he may not find that any changes are necessary, yet he
may be justly said to be using his machine only by way of
experiment; and no one would say that such a use, pursued
with a bona fide intent of testing the qualities of the machine,
would be a public use, within the meaning of the statute. So
long as he does not voluntarily allow others to make it and use
it, and so long as it is not on sale for general use, he keeps the
invention under his own control, and does not lose his title to
a patent.
It would not be necessary, in such a case, that the machine
should be put up and used only in the inventor's own shop or
premises. He may have it put up and used in the premises
of another, and the use may inure to the benefit of the owner
of the establishment. Still, if used under the surveillance of
the inventor, and for the purpose of enabling him to test the
machine, and ascertain whether it will answer the purpose
intended, and make such alterations and improvements as experience demonstrates to be necessary, it will still be a mere
experimental use, and not a public use, within the meaning of
the statute.
Whilst the supposed machine is in such experimental use,
the public may be incidentally deriving a benefit from it. If
it be a grist-mill, or a carding-machine, customers from the surrounding country may enjoy the use of it by having their grain
made into flour, or their wool into rolls, and still it will not be
in public use, within the meaning of the law.
But if the inventor allows his machine to be used by other
persons generally, either with or without compensation, or if
it is, with his consent, put on sale for such use, then it will
be in public use and on public sale, within the meaning of the
law.

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT CO.

[Sup. Ct.

If, now, we apply the same principles to this case, the analogy will be seen at once. Nicholson wished to experiment on
his pavement. He believed it to be a good thing, but he was
not sure; and the only mode in which he could test it was to
place a specimen of it in a public roadway. He did this at his
own expense, and. with the consent of the owners of the road.
Durability was one of the qualities to be attained. He wanted
to know whether his pavement would stand, and whether it
would resist decay. Its character for durability could not be
ascertained without its being subjected to use for a considerable time. He subjected it to such use, in good faith, for the
simple purpose of ascertaining whether it was what he claimed
it to be. Did he do any thing more than the inventor of the
supposed machine might do, in testing his invention? The
public had the incidental use of the pavement, it is true; but
was the invention in public use, within the meaning of the
statute? We think not. The proprietors of the road alone
used the invention, and used it at Nicholson's request, by way
of experiment. The only way in which they could use it was
by allowing the public to pass over the pavement.
Had the city of Boston, or other parties, used the invention,
by laying down the pavement in other streets and places, with
Nicholson's consent and allowance, then, indeed, the invention
itself would have been in public use, within the meaning of the
law; but this was not the case. Nicholson did not sell it, nor
allow others to use it or sell it. He did not let it go beyond
his control. He did nothing that indicated any intent to do so.
He kept it under his own eyes, and never for a moment abandoned the intent to obtain a patent for it.
In this connection, it is proper to make another remark. It
is not a public knowledge of his invention that precludes the
inventor from obtaining a patent for it, but a public use or sale
of it. In England, formerly, as well as under our Patent Act
of 1793, if an inventor did not keep his invention secret, if
a knowledge of it became public before his application for a
patent, he could not obtain one. To be patentable, an invention must not have been known or used before the application;
but this has not been the law of this country since the passage
of the act of 1836, and it has been very much qualified in Eng-

Oct. 1877.]

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT

CO.

land. Lewis v. Dfarling, 10 B. & C. 22. Therefore, if it were
true that during the whole period in which the pavement was
used, the public knew how it was constructed, it would make
no difference in the result.
It is sometimes said that an inventor acquires an undue
advantage over the public by delaying to take out a patent, inasmuch as he thereby preserves the monopoly to himself for a
longer period than is allowed by the policy of the law; but this
cannot be said with justice when the delay is occasioned by a
bona fide effort to bring his invention to perfection, or to ascertain whether it will answer the purpose intended. His monopoly only continues for the allotted period, in any event; and it
is the interest of the public, as well as himself, that the invention should be perfect and properly tested, before a patent is
granted for it. Any attempt to use it for a profit, and not by
way of experiment, for a longer period than two years before
the application, would deprive the inventor of his right to a
patent.
The next question for consideration is, whether the defendants have infringed the patent of Nicholson. On this question we entertain no doubt. The pavement put down by
the defendants in the city of Elizabeth differs in nothing from
that described by Nicholson in his patent, except in the form
of the strips placed between the rows of blocks, and the nicks
or grooves made in the blocks to fit them. In Nicholson's
description, they are simply strips of board standing endwise
on the foundation, The patent describes the strips as "so
arranged as to form spaces of about one inch in thickness
between the rows of principal blocks. The auxiliary strip
may be about half the height of the principal block; but it
must not be permitted to fill up the grooves permanently and
entirely, when the pavement is completed, or to perform any
part of the pavement." The strips used by the defendants are
substantially the same as here described, and perform the same
office. The only difference in their construction and application between the blocks is, that they are bevelled, by being
made wider at the top than at the bottom, - the extra width
of the top part being let into a notch or groove in the blocks.
If they perform the additional office, of partially sustaining the

ELIZABETH V. PAYEMAENT

Co.

[Sup. Ct.

pressure of the blocks and locking them together, they do not
any the less perform the office assigned to them in Nicholson's
pavement. Their peculiar form and application may constitute
an improvement on his pavement, but it includes his.
It is objected, that the blocks of the Elizabeth pavement
have not parallel sides, as prescribed in Nicholson's patent, by
reason of the notch or groove in the side, into which the strips
are fitted; but this notch or groove does not take from the
blocks their general conformity to the requisition of the patent.
They are parallel-sided blocks, with a groove made in the
lower part to receive the edges of the strips. The parallelsided blocks described in Nicholson's patent were probably intended to distinguish them from such blocks as those described
in Stead's patent, which were hexagonal and triangular in form;
or those in Wood's patent, which were of a pyramidal shape,
the opposite sides being at an angle with each other. As contradistinguished from these, both the Nicholson blocks and
those used by the appellants are properly denominated blocks
with parallel sides.
The next subject for consideration is the form and principles
of the decree rendered by the court below. The bill prayed a
decree for damages and profits; but, as it was filed before the
passage of the act of July 8, 1870, which first authorized courts
of equity to allow damages in addition to profits, the court below correctly held that a decree for profits alone could be rendered. It is unnecessary here to enter into the general question
of profits recoverable in equity by a patentee. The subject, as
a whole, is surrounded with many difficulties, which the courts
have not yet succeeded in overcoming. But one thing may be
affirmed with reasonable confidence, that, if an infringer of a
patent has realized no profit from the use of the invention, he
cannot be called upon to respond for profits; the patentee, in
such case, is left to his remedy for damages. It is also clear
that a patentee is entitled to recover the profits that have been
actually realized from the use of his invention, although, from
other causes, the general business of the defendant, in which the
invention is employed, may not have resulted in profits, - as
where it is shown that the use of his invention produced a definite saving in the process of a manufacture. Mhfowry v. Whit-.

ney, 14 Wall. 434; Cawood Patent,94 U. S. 695.' On the contrary, though the defendant's general business be ever so profitable, if the use of the invention has not contributed to the
profits, none can be recovered. The same result would seem
to follow where it is impossible to show the profitable effect
of using the invention upon the business results of the party
infringing. It may be added, that, where no profits are shown
to have accrued, a court of equity cannot give a decree for
profits, by way of damages, or as a punishment for the infringe.
ment. Livingston v. Woodworth, 15 How. 559. But when the
entire profit of a business or undertaking results from the use
of the invention, the patentee will be entitled to recover the
entire profits, if he elects that remedy. And in such a case, the
defendant will not be allowed to diminish the show of profits
by putting in unconscionable claims for personal services or
other inequitable deductions. 1ubber Company v. Goodyear,
9 Wall. 788. These general propositions will hardly admit of
dispute; and they will furnish us some guide in deciding the
questions raised in this case.
Only the defendants have appealed; and the errors assigned
by them on this branch of the case are the following: 1st, "The court erred in decreeing that the complainants do
recover of the defendants, the city of Elizabeth and George W.
Tubbs, the sums set forth in the decree, because the master did
not find that said defendants had made any profits, which failure to find was not excepted to by complainants, and because
no proof was offered by complainants of any profits whatever
made by said defendants."
2d, "The court erred in finding that the profits received by
the defendants were the fruits of the use of the devices described and claimed in the first and second claims of the Nicholson patent, -there being no proof of any advantage derived by
the defendants from such use of the Nicholson devices, -or was
incident to the use of the devices of the Brocklebank & Trainer
patent. The failure to specifically show such profits makes the

report. Whereas, if any profits ought to have been decreed,
they should have been confined to the amount of the license
for a royalty which the complainants had been accustomed to
receive, and were bound by the terms of their title to accept,
from any party constructing such pavement in New Jersey."
We will consider these assignments in order.
The first seems to be well taken. The party who made the
profit by the construction of the pavement in question was
the New Jersey Wood-Paving Company. The city of Elizabeth made no profit at all. It paid the same for putting down
the pavement in question that itwas paying to the defendant
in error for putting down the Nicholson pavement proper;
namely, $4.60 per square yard. It made itself liable to damages, undoubtedly, for using the patented pavement of Nicholson; but damages are not sought, or, at least, are not
recoverable, in this suit. Profits only, as such, can be recovered therein. The very first evidence which the appellees
offered before the master was, the contracts made between the
city and the other defendants for the construction of the pavement; and these contracts show the fact that the city was to
pay the price named, and that any benefit to be derived from,
the construction of the pavement was to be enjoyed by the
contractors.
It is insisted that the defendants, by answering jointly, admitting that they were jointly co-operating in laying the pavement, precluded themselves from making this defence. We
do not think so. That admission is not inconsistent with the
actual facts of the case, to wit, that this co-operation consisted
of a contract for having the pavement made, on one side, and
a contract to make it, on the other; and is by no means conclusive as to which party realized profit from the transactions.
The complainants themselves, by their own evidence, showed
that the contractors and not the city realized it.
The appellant, Tubbs, is in the same predicament with the
city. Several of the contracts were made in his name, it is
true; but they were made in behalf of the New Jersey WoodPaving Company, for whose use and benefit the contracts were
made and completed. Tubbs only received a salary for his
superintendence.

The next assignment of error, based on the hypothesis that
the profits received by the defendants were not the fruits of the
use of Nicholson's invention, appears to us destitute of foundation. This matter is so fully and ably presented in the opinion
of the Circuit Court as to require but little discussion from
us. The Nicholson pavement was a complete thing, consisting
of a certain combination of elements. The defendants used it
as such, -the whole of it. If they superadded the addition
made to it by Brocklebank & Trainer, they failed to show that
such addition contributed to the profits realized. The burden
of proof was on them to do this. The evidence, if it shows
any thing, tends to prove that the addition diminished the
profits instead of increasing them; but it could not have had
much influence either way, inasmuch as the evidence shows
that the profit made on this pavement was about the same
as that made on the pavement of Nicholson, without the improvement. The appellants, however, obtained an allowance of
nearly $14,000 for the royalty paid by them for the use of the
Brocklebank & Trainer patent. This allowance went so far in
diminution of the profits recovered.
Equally without foundation is the position taken by the
appellants, that other pavements, approaching in resemblance
to that of Nicholson, were open to the public, and that the
specific difference between those pavements and Nicholson's
was small, and that, therefore, the Nicholson patent was entitled to only a small portion of the profits realized. Nicholson's
pavement, as before said, was a complete combination in itself,
differing from every other pavement. The parts were so correlated to each other, from bottom to top, that it required them
all, put together as he put them, to make the complete whole,
and to produce the desired result. The foundation impervious to moisture, the blocks arranged in rows, the narrow strips
between them for the purposes designated, the filling over thole
strips, cemented together, as shown by the patent,- all were
required. Thus combined and arranged, they made a new
thing, like a new chemical compound. It was this thing, and
not another, that the people wanted and required. It was this
that the appellants used, and, by using, made their profit, and
prevented the appellee from making it. It is not the case

ELIZABETH V. PAVE

C[ENT

t.
[Sup. Ct.

of a profit derived from the construction of an old pavement
together with a superadded profit derived from adding thereto
an improvement made by Nicholson, but of an entire profit
derived from the construction of his pavement as an entirety.
A separation of distinct profit derived from Brocklebank &
Trainer's improvement, if any such profit was made, might
have been shown; but, as before stated, the appellants failed
to show that any such distinct profit was realized.
We have looked over the various items claimed by the
appellants by way of reduction of profits, and disallowed by
the master and by the court below, and we are satisfied with
the result which they reached. The gross profits of the work
over actual expenses for material and labor were conceded to
be $128,610.78. The total deductions claimed before the master amounted to $139,875.63, which would have been considerably more than sufficient to absorb the whole profits. The
master and the court allowed deductions to the amount of
$48,618.62, which reduced the profits to $74,992.16, for which
amount the decree was rendered. The deductions overruled
and disallowed amounted to $91,257.85. Of these, $31,111.92
was a profit of twenty per cent, which the appellants claimed
they had a right to add to the actual cost of lumber and other
materials and labor. It is only necessary to state the claim to
show its preposterousness. Other items were one of $7,000 for
salaries, and another of $83,000 for rent, for a period of time
that occutred after the work was completed. Another item
was one of $2,675.09 for the cost of a dock which the parties
built on their own land; and another of $25,000, paid for an
interest in the Brocklebank & Trainer patent. As the appellants still hold these properties, we cannot well conceive what
the purchase of them has to do in this account. They also
claim $15,241.38 for that amount abated from the assessments
of some of their stockholders who owned lands along the streets
paved. As this was a gratuity which they made to themselves,
they cannot claim a deduction for it here. The last item was
$6,572.75, claimed to have been profits made upon other work,
which were allowed to be included in these contracts. As this
is not explained in any satisfactory way, we think the master
did right in rejecting it.

ELIZABETH V. PAVEMENT CO.

We are entirely satisfied with the disposition made of these
various items, and with the correctness of the decree, so far as
the statement of the account is concerned.
But the appellants assign a third error. They insist that the
appellee, as assignor of the Nicholson patent for the State of
New Jersey (which was the ground of its title), was entitled to
recover only thirty-one cents per square yard in any event,being limited to that charge for the use of the patent by the
terms of the assignment; sixteen cents of which was to be paid
to the proprietors, and fifteen to be. retained by the appellee.
This matter is quite satisfactorily disposed of in the opinion
of the court below. The stipulation was between third parties,
and the appellants have no concern in it. It only applied, by
its terms, to cases where, by reason of the decisions of the
courts, or otherwise, it should be found impracticable for the
appellees to obtain contracts for laying the pavement in any
town or city, or where the work of constructing pavements
should be required by law to be let under public lettings, open
to general competition. The object was to secure as extensive
a use of the pavement as possible, as thereby the emoluments
of the proprietors would be increased. But the assignment
gave to the appellee the exclusive right in the patent for the
State of New Jersey. It did not prohibit the appellee from
constructing the pavements itself, if it could obtain contracts
for doing so, and making thereby any profit it could. There
was no obstacle to its doing this in the city of Elizabeth. On
the contrary, it did obtain from the city large contracts, and
would have obtained more if the appellants had not interfered.
There is nothing in this state of things which entitles the latter, after making large profits from the use of the invention, to
refuse to respond therefor. It is not for them to say that the
hands of the appellee are tied by its contract with its grantor.
This would be to take advantage of their own wrong. Whatever bearing the stipulation in the assignment may have on the
measure of damages, in an action at law, it affords no defence
to the appellants when called upon to account for the profits
which they have wrongfully made by pirating the invention.
We think there is no error in the decree of the Circuit Court,
except in making the city of Elizabeth and George W. Tubbs

accountable for the profits. As to them a decree for injunction only to prevent them from constructing the pavement during the term of the patent, should have been rendered; which,
of course, cannot now be made. As to the New Jersey WoodPaving Company, the decree was in all respects correct. A
decree for costs in the court below should be awarded against
all the defendants.
The decree of the Circuit Court, therefore, must be reversed
with costs, and the cause remanded to said court with instructions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion; and

1. Where it can see that no harm resulted to the appellant, this court will not
reverse a decree on account of an immaterial departure from the technical
rules of proceeding.
2. The statute of Iinnesota declares that, in the foreclosure of a mortgage by a
proceeding in court, the debtor, after the confirmation ot the sale, shall be
allowed twelve months in which to redeem, by paying the amount bid at
the sale, with interest. Where, in a foreclosure suit, a decree, passed by a
court of the United States sitting in that State, ordered the master, on nlaking the sale, to deliver to the purchaser a certificate that, unless the mortgaged premises were, within twelve months after the sale, redeemed, by
payment of the sum bid, with interest, he would he entitled to a deed, and
should he let into possession upon producing the master's deed and a certified copy of the order of the court confirming the report of the sale, - Hdd,
