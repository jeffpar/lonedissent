STOY.

THE defendant

was brought before tha'Court on a Hab. (*rp.
and the return ftated, that he was commited in execution by
the warrant of a )Iflice ofth peace for a debt of io, 6, 3"
Sergeznmt moved that he fhould be difcharged, on this principle,

that although the errors of a Juffice, while he keeps.within his jurifdilion, are binding, 'till his judgment is reverfed ; yet where he
exceeds his jurifdi&ion, all his aas are, in.themfelvcs, merely null
and void. '
BY TI COUR.-It appearing upon the face of the record, thlt
thejuftice has excceded his jurifdidion, by giving judgment, and
iffuing an. execution, for a greater fum than ten .pounds, we cannot
but confider the whole as a nullity ; and, for that reafon alone, dilcharge the defendant.
