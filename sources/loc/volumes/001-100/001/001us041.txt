The rrifoner being brought before the Court to receive fentence,
kief 7juiee, addreffied him to the following effetM'KEaAN,
Gorne,'us Sweers :-After a fair and full trial, you have been conviaed of thc crime of Fcrgery, upon two indi6iments, by a Special
Jury of your country. The offence fated in the fir_indiement, is
that of altering a receipt given by _114argaretDuncan ; and the charge
contained in thefecondindi&rnent, is that of forging a receipt, purporting to be the receipt of Adam Fzdke. Your council have taken
e ve-a, eXCL .ions to the form and fubftance of 'thefe indi&ments,
upol. - ,ij-,ion in arreft of judgment.
Thefiyfl exception was, " that, at the time of the offence chargnitied States were not a body corporate known in law.",
" ed, the
But the Court are of a different opinion. From the moment of
their affociation, the United States neceffarily became a body corporate ; for, there was no fuperior from whom that chara&er.-could
otherwife be derived. In England, the king, lords, and commons,
are certainly a body corporate; and yet there never was any charter
or flatute, by, which they -were exprefsiy fo created. An indi&ment,
however, may be fufficiently maintained upon " an intent to de"fceivb my lieg e fibjes ;" and to that purpofe there is a pofitive
authority, notreferred to by the council, where a perfon was indi&ed, for having in his cuflody z piece of bafe metal, in the fimilitude
of a fix-pence, knowing it to be bafe, with intent to defraud the
liege fibjeds &c.
Thef'cond exception was, " that the charges in the indi6ments;
On this
"'were not dire"t and pofitive, but only argumentative."
poinz we cannot helitate to declare, that the charges appear to us to
be as direct and pofitive, as it was poffible to exprefs them.
Fne third exception was, " that the indi&ments do not charge
But in the King verus
" that -nv perfon was aatually defrauded."

ment would well lie. In .the cafe of forgery, properly fo called,
which includes only records, deeds, wills, or public initruments,
it may, perhaps, be neceffary that fome perfon fhould be a&ually
prejudiced. This rule, however, does not extend to cheats of the
prefent'defcription,; in which it is fuficient, that the a& be of a projudicial nature.
Upon thewhole, we are of opinion, that yourconvition has been
legal, as well as juft ; and, therefore, it only remains to pronounce
the fentence of the Court.
Sentence, on the firft indi6lment :-A fine of Â£. 70. and imprifonment until the 4th of July, the anniverfary of dmericanIndependence.
Sentence, on the fecond indi&ment :-A fine of C. 1020. Imprifonment until the next annual ele&ion for Pennfylvania, and
flanding in the pillory for one hour.
