a baker -em,TH I S was an indictment againft the Defendant,
a cheat, in baking
ploycd by the army of the United States, for

2.i9 barrells of bread, and marking them as 'weighing'88 lb. each.

4ttorney (-neral(Sergeant) infifled, that the Defendant's office
was a public truf ; and cited 2 Burr. 1125. 1 Hawk. 187.
Taz COURT faid, that this was clearly an injury to the public;.

weighing them again. The public indeed, could not by common
prudence prevent the fraud, as th6 Defendant was himfelfthe officer
of the public pro hac vice. They were therefore of opinion, that
the offence was inditable.
