FOREMAN.

T

HIS was a Foreign ttachrnnt, which iffued returnable to the
prefent telrm; and, on arguing a rule to fhew caufe, why the
writ fhould not be quafhed, it was proved, that, on the 5 th of December, the Defendant was at Lancafter, in his way to Fort Pitt,
where he intended to proceed to the Spanifh fettlement below the
Nqtches, on the Miyftpi, but was a&ually at Fort Pitt or. the 2d
of January, 1790.
SHIPPEN, Prefident, obferved, that while a man remained in the
$tate, though avowing an intention to withdraw from it, he muG
be confidered as an inhabitant, and; therefore, not an obje& of the
Preign Attachment. If an inhabitant clandeftinely withdraws, or
fecretes himfelf, to avoid his creditors, he becomes liable to the
,Domeflic Attachment. The having once been an inhabitant will
not, however, prote& a man forever from a Fo~eign_4ttachment,where
he has notorioufly emigrpted from the State, and fettled elfewhere.
But the cafe before the Court, is that of a ForeignAttachmtnt i ffued
at thevcry time that the Defendant was an inhabitant of the State,
which cannot be maintained.
Let the rule be made abfolute.
