SIvpPN, Prident:-As the law that has 'prevailed upon this 1758.
fubje&, is adapted to the 'peculiar fituation of the cotintry, it will 1..
naturally differ from the law which is eflablifhed in other places,
under different circumftances. Thus, though in England, the fhopbook of a tradefman is not evidence of a debt, without the afliftant
oath of the clerk who madethe entry; yet here, from the neceffity of
the cafe, as bufinefs is often carried on by the principal, and many
of our tradefmen do not keep clerks, the book, proved by the oath of
the Plaintiff himfelf, has always been admitted. The pra&ice, in
this refpe&, how-ever, has Deen confined to charge ths original
debtor, to whom the goods were fold ; for, the neceffity of the cafe
only required, thatthe Plaintiffs oath fhould be allowed to prove the
atual delivery; aknd it would be highly dangerous, if the evidence
wereextended to eflablifh the affumption of a third perfon to pay the
debt.
It is the duty of the Jury, the .fore, to confider, whether the Dcfendant, on the prefent occafion, is the originaldebtor, ot merely a
perfon affumink to pay the debt of another. If, indeed, it appears,
that he has fent a fervant, or tradefman, for .thefe goods, on his own
account, he is clearly liable; for, when they come to his ufe, that
makes him the original debtor.- But, if I go to a lhol with a joiner,
and fay to the mafter, I will fee you paid for the articles with which
you truft this man ;" here, though I am liable upon proof of this
undertaking, yet it is not in the chara&er of the original debtor, for
the joiner who received the goods is the original debtor; but it is on
account of what the law terms my collateral promife ; .which carnot be proved by the teftimony of the party interefted, but, may by
a note in writing,, by fome indifferent witnefs to the tranf'a&ion.
In the cafe before us, the evidence of the Juftice (Mr. Howef) is
not certain as to the circumfiances; for, the goods were delivered in
fmall parcels, from time to time ; they were fuch as fuited the joiner's bufinefs; and, even from "tle Plaintiff's own. account, they
were applied to his ufe, though the Defendant wag confidered to be
liable for the payment. Whether thefe fats, therefore, and the
Defendant's previous pur.chafe at the Plaintiff's flore, will account
for the acknowledgement of having received a part, the Jury muft
determine. But it they are of opinion, that the Defendant has only
affumed to pay the debt of another perfon, the Plaintiffs cannot be
witneffes in the caufe, and, confequently, there is no proof of the
affumption. On the eontrary, if they think the Defendant is the original debtor, the Plaintiffs are witneffes to prove the entry in their
book, and they are entitled to.recover the amount of their demand.
VERDICT for the Defendant.
