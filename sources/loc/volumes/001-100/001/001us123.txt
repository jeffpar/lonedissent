Afpril Term, 1785.

DAVISO-N's Leffee veqf s BLbOmEk.,

DEED, aftefted by two witneffes, one 6f whom had marripd
the Leffor of the plaintiff, the other refiding within the Coufhty and not produced, was offered in evidence, upon proof of the
hand writing of the witireffes.
Hartly obje&ed, that.it wvould be better evidence to prove the execution of-the dcted by the abf(nt witnefs, not i'nterefted ; and, therefore, this ought not to be allowed.
Yeates contended, that if a witnefs is incapaciated either by his
own a&, or by the aft of Gdd, proof of the.hand writing is fu.fficien't; as whdie a witnefs has been convi&ed of perjury.
A

C6URT.- 'TIxe is a cafe in Strange where a party",
By Twho was.a witnefs to a bond, afterwards became interefled, and, al'though the proof of his hand writing was admitted, yet there mull,
likewife, have beer proof that the other witnefs could not be found.
The befl evidence of which the cafe reafonably admits has not bee4
offered; and,,therefore, we -canotallow the d. d to be read on this
"occafiorn.
