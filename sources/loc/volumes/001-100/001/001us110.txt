Meng ,Co.-Lewis, for the defendant, obje&ed to the admiflion
of Meng s teftimony ; contending, that if Meng could prove that the
note was falfe, it would difcharge him from the payment; and if
he proved it-to be a genuine note, his evidence might 'e given
againfi him in a civil ation founded upon the note ; in either event
he was an interefted witnefs, and, confequently, an incompetent one.

4 Burr. 2252. He infifted that the evidence given by Meng on
the prefent trial could not affect him in a civil adion; and obferved, that if any thing relative to the civil affion fhould.decide the
cafe before the court, the probability was, that l'Ieng's teftimony
would be favourable to the prifoner; for if Meng fwears the note
to be falfe, he can gain nothing; but if he proves it to be true, lie
tefrifies againft his own intereft.
Lewis, in reply, acknowledged that the evidence given on this
trial, could not be offered in favour of Meng on another; but he
urged, that if the note itfelf were proved.to be forged, it might be
detained by the court and not fuffered afterwards to be fuedt;theon

M'KEAN, Chief '.uflice. The court will not detain a note or
bond in the circumitances mentioned., With refpe& to the competency of the witnefs, I remember a cafe before CHEW, Chief.Ju.lice, where one Chap;nanwas indi&ed for playing with falfe dice,
and the perfon cheated was admitted to be a witnefs. On the authority of that decifion, in a recent trial at Lancafler,the injured party was allowed to give evidence, after a full argument upon the
prefent objeaion. We have, therefore, no doubt that Meng is a
competent witaefs.
