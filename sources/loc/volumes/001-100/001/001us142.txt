on a cafe flated; in fubftance as

On the 5 th of MV1arch 1782, a mortgage was executed by AXel
Kelly to homas Groome and his affins, for fecuring the payment
of
Â£47.4. o with intereft on the 5 th of March 1783.- - On the th of
9
duguft 1782, the mortgage was afligned fora valuable confideration

to John Dorrow ; who fued out a Scire Faciasto June Term 1784.,
the day of payment beihg paft.-After the Aflignment, and before
the Sgate lacias fued, Kdll. became indebted to the faid Dorrow by
notes and book accounts in dive-rs futbs, which full remain unpaid
and payable.
ingerfoll,for the defendant, had obtained a rule to fhcw caufe why
the proceedings on the Scir Facias fhould not be flayed, upon payment of the principal mortgage money, interefts and cofts only
without payment of the fubfequent fimplecontraa debts?

after the day of payment, the mortgaged premifes are forfeited in
fltri& law,; the privilege of redemption afterwards is a matter
of
equity, which (hall be withheld until the mortgagor does equity by
payment of all debts ; that it, prevents a multipl icity of fiits, and
efih&uates fubflantial juftice.. And he contended that in Pennfylvania the chancery jurifdiffion for redemption of mortgages, is transferred by the a& of Affembly to the common law Courts, which will
alfo take care that he who claims equity hall do it. He cited a
great number of cafes, both as to the reafons and conclufions of the
