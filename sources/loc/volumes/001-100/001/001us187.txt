KIRWAN.

Tj~HE Referrees in this care, had allowed ex parte evidence to be
given, of the current price of Coach-maker's work, at the
time when :hs caufe of aftion accrued. For this reafon, the Deftendant moved to fet afide their report.
And BY THE COURT: If Referrees make enquiry abroad, to
afcertain for their own fatisfaffion, the price of work, or the truth
ot any other matter, which may be faid, comparitively, to be of a
public nature, this, fo far from being irregular, would be highly
commendable. But it is a very dilfferent cafe, when they proceed
feparately to examine a witnefs, who has been produced by one
of the parties, although the evidence relates only to thofe general
points. The adverfe parties fhould have an opportunity of crofs
examining the witnefs.
The Report fet afide.
