court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause
be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs; and that this
cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit

During the -warwith Mexico, the Admittance, an American vessel, was seized in a
port of California, by the commander of a vessel of war of the United States,
upon suspicion of trading with the enemy. She was condemned as a lawful prize
by the chaplain belonging to one of the vessels of war upon that station, who had
been authorized by the President of the United States to exercise admiralty jurisdiction in cases of capture.
The owners of the cargo filed a libel against the captain of the vessel of war, in the
Admiralty Court for the District of Columbia. Being carried to the Circuit Court,
it was decided:
1. That the condemnation in California was invalid as a defence for the captors.
2. That the answer of the captors, having averred sufficient probable cause for the
seizure of the cargo, and the libellants having demurred to this answer, upon the'
ground that the District Court had no right to adjudicate, because the property
had not been brought within its jurisdiction, the demurrer was overruled, and judgment was entered against the libellants.
The judgment of the Circuit Court, upon the first point, was correct, and upon the
second point, erroneous.
The Prize Court established in California was not authorized by the laws of the United
States or the laws of nations.
The grounds alleged for the seizure of the vessel and cargo in the answer, viz., that
the vessel ailed- from New Orleans with the design of trading with the enemy.
and did, in fact, hold illegal intercourse with them, are sufficient to subject both to
condemnation, if they are supported by testimony.
And, if they were liable to capture and condemnation, the reasons assigned in the
answer for not bringing them into a port of the United States and libelling them
for condemnation, viz., that it was impossible do so consistently with the public
interests, are sufficient, if supported by proof, to justify the captors in selling vessel and cargo in California, and to excmpt them from damages on that account.

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

499

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.
The Admiralty Court in the district had jurisdiction of the case, and it yws the duty
of the court to order the captors to institute proceedings in that court, to condemn
the property as prize, by a day to be named in the order; and in default thereof,
to be proceeded against upon the libel for an unlawful seizure.
The Admiralty Court, in the District of Columbia, had jurisdiction of such a libel
for condemiation, although the property was not brought within its jurisdiction;
and, if they found it liable to condemnation, might proceed to condemn it, although
it v6as not brought within the custody or control of the court.
The necessitv of proceeding to condemn as prize, does not arise from any difference
between the Instance Court and the Prize Court, as known in England. The
same court here*possesses the instance and prize jurisdiction. But because the
property of the neutral is not divested by the capture, but by the condemnation
in a prize court; and it is not divested until condemnation, although, when condemned, the condemnation relates back to the capture.
As this libel is for the restitution of the property or the proceeds, probable cause of
teizure is no defence. It is a good defence against a claim for damages, when the
property has been restored, or lost after seizure without the fault of the captor.
But, while the property or proceeds is withheld by the captor, and claimed as
prize, probable cause of seizure is no defence.
The Circuit Court, therefore, erred in deciding that probable cause of seizure was a
good defence.
THESZ were appeals from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the coujuty
of Washington.
The facts are fully stated in the opinion of the court.
The cases were argued together by .13r. Coxe and Mr. Nelson,
for Jecker, Torre & Company, and by 11r. Kfey and llir. Johnson,
for Captain Montgomery.
The arguments on both sides took a wide range, and it is impossible to insert the entire views of the case 'taken by the
respective counsel. The following are given' as those bearing
upon what appear to be the principal points.
The arguments were divided into two heads:
1st. The ground of defence taken in the answer of the respondent, that the property had been carried into the port of
Monterey, a town in California, then occupied by the American
forces, within the limits of Mexico, and there had been regularly
proceeded against and condemned as prize of war, by a coit
exercising at that place admiralty jurisdiction.
The libellants demurred to this plea or defence, and both.the
District and Circuit Courts sustained the demurrer; and from
this decision the respondent appealed. The arguments -ofthe
counsel upon this branch of the case, although of an interesting
character, hre omitted for want of room.
The seqond demurrer was also to a part of the answer, and
was as follows:
"The libellants, as to so much of the answer of the respondent,
filed in this case, as alleges and sets up any act or thing on the
part of the captain and crew of the said ship Admittance, or
any of omission or commission of any sort or kind, as a justifi-

cation of the said seizure of said ship or her cargo as lawful prize
of war, or which might amount to probable cause of said seizure,
demurs to the same; and for cause of demurrer avers and says,
that this court in this cause has no rightful jurisdiction or authority to examine or adjudicate upon any question of prize, or
of probable cause of capture as prize of war, but that the same
belongs exclusively to the courts of the United States exercising
prize jurisdiction, and having within its jurisdiction and control
the property so seized or captured as prize, which this court has
not, and, in consequence of the tortious and illegal acts of. said
respondent, as alleged and set forth in said libel, cannot have.
"Wherefore, and for other causes, these libellants do demur to
so much of said answer as is above set forth.
" CoxE, Advocate and Proctorfor Libellants."
This demurrer was also sustained by the District Court, but
the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court, and from this
decision the libellants appealed.
Upon this point the argument of tie counsei for the libellants
was as follows:
The respondent, however, insists that lie has in this action a
right to show1. An actual and sufficient case of prize of war, as a bar to
the remedy asked in the libel.
2. Probable cause of seizure, as a bar to the action.
1st. This is a civil suit to'recover back property originally belonging to libellants, of which they have been forcibly divested
by defendants, under whose authority it has been sold and con-.
verted into money. Can the party in .such a suit aver legal
cause of capture and condemnation as prize without producing
a valid decree of condemnation as prize by a court of competbnt jurisdiction ?
U he can, then this singular anomaly and most dangerous
precedent will be exhibited, that a captor may disregard the injunctions of the law, and his own paramount duty; omit to
bring his prize into court; to institute prize proceedings ;- but
may retain the property in his own hands, or at his, pleasure
convert it into money ; and when called upon to answer in a
civil suit, set up as a defence, an original cause of condemnation.
It will scarcely be doubted that the jurildiction of the prize
courts, in cases of prize, is exclusive. The nature and extent of
this jurisdiction, as it exists in England, are digtinctively given by
Lord Mansfield in Lindo v. Rodney, Dougl. 613. 1 Kent, 353;
Conld. 354; Dunl. Ad. Pr. 26; 12 Wheat. 1, 11. In every respect it differs from the ordinary Court of Admiralty. " The
manner of proceeding is totally different, the whole system of

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

501

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

litigation and jurisprudence in the Prize Court is peculiar to
itself; it is no more like the Court of Admiralty than it is to any
court in Westminster Hall." See particularly the language of
Lord Mansfield, p. 616.
The claimant of the property cannot himself institute prize
proceedings. They must always be had in-the name of the
government, to whom all prizes prihd.facie belong. The only

remedy the captured has is by monition, a proceeding in personawn to compel the captors to perform their duty.
The ordinary Court of Admiralty has no more authority to
condemn a prize than a court of common law; and should the
doctrine asserted for this defendant prevail, these singular results
must inevitably follow1st. The captors can never acquire any legal right to the property, unless by a decree of a prize court. This is, through6ut,
recognized in Home v. Camden, in 1 I-1. Bl. 476; 4 T. R. 382;
and especially in 2 H. BI. 541, 542, in the unanimous opinion
of the twelve judges.
* 2d. The United States can assert no right, for its right depends also upon a sentence of condemnation, which alone can
divest the former title.
3d. The original proprietor is forbidden by this doctrine from
asserting his title.
The only party in whom the law recognizes a titfe, is forbidden to assert it, and the government, and the sub-officers. and
crew of the capturing vessel, have no rights cognizable in a
court. This property, therefore, on this doctrine, must remain in
the hands of the present defendant, subject to no responsibility.
The only mode of avoiding these absurd consequences is to
enforce the law as above stated. 2 Wheat. Appx. 9. When a
ship is captured, it is the duty of the captors to send her -into
some convenient port for adjudication. Citing the Huldah and
other cases; the Mentor, 1 Rob. 151; the Susanna, 6 Rob. 48.
In the Madonna del Burso, (4 Rob. 171,) Sir W. Scott says: "However justifiable the seizure may have been, the first obligation which the seizor has to discharge, is that of accounting
why he did not institute proceedings against the vessel and
cargo immediately; and unless he can exculpate himself with
respect to delay in this matter, he" is guilty 6~f no inconsiderable
breach of duty. It would be highly injurious to the commerce
of other countries, and disgraceful to the jurisprudence of this,
if any persons, commissioned or non-commissioned, could lay
their hands upon valuable ships and cargoes in our harbors, and
keep their hands upon them without bringing such an' act to
judicial notice in any manner for the space of three, or four
months."

502

SUPREME -COURT.
Jocker et al. v. Montgomery.

"A belligerent nation which is in the exercise of these
rights of war, is bound to find tribunals for the regulation of
them; tribunals clear in their authority, as well as pure in
their administration; and if from causes of private internal
policy, arising out of the peculiar relation of the component
parts of the belligerent State, difficulties arise, the neutral is
not to be prejudiced ithat account; he has a right to speedy
and unobstructed justice, and has nothing to do with such difficulties created by questions of domestic constitution." Id. 177.
This view furnishes an answer to the suggestion of the necessity of creating and resorting to such a court as was erected in
California. So, in page 147, will be found an equally decisive
answer to the suggestion of counsel, that -the master of the Admittance appeared before the Alcalde at Monterey. These libellants were not present, nor had the captain any authority to represent them; and he, as Sir W. Scott says, "only follo, ed
where he was led."
In the case of the St. Juan Baptista, (5 Rob. 33,) the prize was
brought into England on the 12th of August, and proceedings
were instituted on the 12th September, and the court held that
it was bound to require a satisfactory cause for this delay.
"Grievous," says Sir W. Scott, "would be the injury to neutral
trade, and highly disgraceful to the honor of our country, if captors could bring in ships at their own fancy, and detain them
any leigth of time without bringing the matter to the cogni.
zance of a court of justice. In the present instance this first
and fundamental duty has not been performed." 11Persons ven-'
turing to take out a commission of war must instruct themselves
in their own duty, and if any inconvenience arises from their
neglect, the neutral claimant is not to suger." In the case at
bar, no prize proceedings have to this day been instituted; this
fundamental duty, as Sir W. Scott calls it, has been wholly neglected. The property has never been brought within the United
States, - another fundamental duty. The ,apers and, documents
on board have never been transmitted to any District Court, a'
peremptory requisition of the law is thus disregarded. It is intimated they are in the possession of the Navy Department.
How did the captors procure them from the- pseudo court at
Monterey, and under what authority are they lodged in the Navy
Department? The property no longer remains specifically; it
has been converted into money, and no prize court can now proceed to adjudication.
In the Wilhelmsberg, (5 Rob. 143,) the same learned judge, observing upon the duty of the captor to send his prize to some
convenient port, says that "in that consideration the convenience of the claimant, in proceeding to adjudication,- is (among)

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

503

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

one of the first things to which the attention of the captor ought
to be addressed." "He considered that the port selected in that
case was not such a port, a place where the captor cannot get
advice, much less can the claimant learn in what manner to
proceed, or where to resort for justice."
If such was the character of that port, what shall be said of
Monterey, a place not within the jurisdiction of any court of the
United States; a port of the very enemy with whom we were
at war, occupied, it is true, so far as their guns could reach, by
an American force; where no tribunal existed which could direct
its process, or exercise jurisdiction; no judge responsible for the
performance of judicial function; where the protecting arm and
supervising power of the Circuit or Supreme Court could not
reach; where no counsel could be found competent t6 give correct advice. How infinitely further from the shadow of right
than in the case of the Wilhelmsberg, already cited, or that of the
Lively, (1 Gall. 315,) where the court condemned the captor for
carrying the property captured in the neighborhood of Machias
River, to Salem. The Lively was a case in which the claimants
had filed a libel for restitution, as here, and in which a monition
to proceed to adjudication issued against the captors, who accordingly libelled the property as prize. It was not attempted
there, as here, to bar the relief sought in the Instance Court by
setting up a lawful cause for condemnation as prize of war, or a
probable cause to justify the seizure. Before that learned court
no such ground of defence would be offered or admitted. There
it was the well known law, that the Prize Court could only alone
adjudicate upon these questions.
Had the captured property been brought within the jurisdiction of the District Court, having power to proceed as in a prize
case, and such proceedings had been commenced, the claimant
might have proceeded by petition in that court to compel the
captors to proceed to adjudication. Such was the course in
the case of the William, 4 Rob. 214. When, however, the
property is beyond the jurisdiction of the Prize Court, so that no
prize jurisdiction can be exercised, then a monition issues from
the instance side of the court, proceeding personally against the
captors, commanding them to perform the duty enjoined on
them by law, or to restore the property.
It must be borre in mind, that in this case no claim is presented for vindictive damages; the captor is not sought to be
molested for his acts of wrong, or for his omission to perform a
duty. The simple demand is, that, having seized our property,
having failed to perform the fundamental duty imposed on him
by law, having failed to show his right to capture, having omitted to permit us to assert our rights and maintain our innocence

SUPREME

COURT.

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

in the only court having jurisdiction to decide the question of
prize, he shall restore the property specifically; or if he has put
it out of his power by any means, of doing this, then that he
shall respond in value. Our proceeding is more nearly assimilated to the common-law actions of trover or replevin, than of
trespass. The, issue presented is simply of a right to, property.
If the property belongs to libellants, they are entitled to a decree of restitftion; if that property has been divested, and the
right now belongs to the defendant, he is entitled to judgnent.
This conclusion cannot be avoided by adopting a principle
asserted-by -the learned counsel for the respondent, viz., that
condemnation as prize is not necessary to vest the title to the
property captured, in the captors. He asserts that a forfeiture
attaches in rem, when the offence is committed, and the property
is instantly divested.
(The counsel then proceeded to comment upon this position,
and concluded as follows.)
If, in this proceeding, the question of prize cannot be raised,
or decided; if the court cannot proceed to condemn, and therefore, will not permit defendant, collaterally and incidentally, to
avail himself of such a ground of defence, as little ground-is
there for the analogous defence upon which the' Circuit Court
seems to have rested that portion of the decree from which we
have appealed, viz., that the pleadings disclose a case of probable cause of capture which justified the seizure and bars this
action.
This point, it is believed, was not arguxed in the court below,
but was gratuitously taken by the learned judges themselves, the
chief judge not sitting in the cause.
It is apprehended, that in deciding Ln to be a bar to the action, the whole principle of the 4aw as to probable cause, has
been lost sight of. Pxobable cause is recognized as a justifiable
ground of seizure, either as prize jure bell, or for a statute for.
feiture. In the first class of cases, where the capture has been
made as prize of war, the general principles of the law of nations
provides this defence; where made for an alleged forfeiture under a statute, such protection must be conferred by statute, or
it is not available. But, whether in the one case or the other,
these principles are believed to be incontrovertible and universal.
1. The question of probable cause belongs exclusively to the
court which has jurisdiction to condemn or to decree forfeiture.
2. It can be adjudged in that court only in a proceeding to
obtain condemnation.
3. Only in such court, after a decree refusing condemnation
and directing restitution.

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.
Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

4. The only legal operation of a certificate of probable cause
is to bar a recovery of damages for an unlawful seizure.
The general principles which -govern cases of this character,
are embodied in our statute book. 1 Stat. at Large, 696, 122."
The 89th sect. of the act of March 2, 1799, provides for cases of
seizures under the collectibn laws, and enacts that "when any
prosecution shall be commenced on account of the seizure of
any ship or vessel, goods, &c., and jidgment shall be Igiven for
the claimant or claimants; if .it shall appear to the court before
whbm such prosecution shall be fried, that there was a reasonable cause of seizure, the said court shall cause a proper certificate or entry to be made thereof, and in such case, the claimant or claimants shall not be entitled to costs, nor shall the'"erson who made the seizure, or the prosecutor, be liable to action,
suit, or judgment, on account of such seizure and prosecution."
Similar provisions may be found in other statutes inflicting forfeitures.
The act of June 26,1812, (2 Stat. at Large, 759, c.J107,) concerning letters of marque, prizes, and prize goods, in its 6th section,
provides ".that before breaking bulk of any vessel Which shall be
captured as aforesaid, or other disposal or conversion thereof, or
of any article which shall be found on board the same, such
captured vessel, goods, or effects, shall be brought into some port
of the United States, and shall be proceeded against before a
competent tribunal; and after condemnation and forfeiture
thereof, shallibelong to the owners and captors thereof, and bew
distributed as aforesaid; and in the case of all captured vessels,
goods, and effects, which shall be brought within the jurisdiction
of the United States, the District Courts of the United States
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction thereof, as in civil cases
of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; and the said courts, or
the courts being courts of the United Stateshlnto which said
eases shall be removed, and in which they shall be finally decided, shall and may decree restitution in whole or in part, when
the capture shall have been made without just cause; and, if
made without probable cause, or otherwise unreasonably, may
order and decree damages and costs to the party injured."
These provisions embody the correct doctrine of the law relating to probable cause; and it is confidently asserted that no
case can be produced in which even a certificate of probable
caufse, given by a court exercising exclusive jurisdiction, was
ever thought to'present a bar to a claim for restitution .of property.
The argument of the counsel for the respondent, viz., the corn.
.petency of the court in California, is omitted.
Upon the question presented by the second demurrer, viz.,
VOL. XIII.

43

506

SUPREME COURT.
Jecker et al. v.

Montgomery.

4"Can the respondent. defend himself in this suit by the matters
and things stated in his answer ?" a part of the argument of the
counsel was -s follows.
It is contended, by the learned counsel for the libellants, that
the respondent cannot defend himself in this suit by showing
any "act or thing on the part of the captain or crew of the ship
Admittance, or any act of omission or commission of any sort
or kind as a justification of the said seizure of said ship or her
cargo, as lawful prize of war, or which might amount to probable cause for said seizure, etc."
It is thought this position cannot be maintained; it indicates
a fear upon the pait of the libellants, themselves admitted wrongdoers, to meet the'respondent upon fair ground, the merits of the
case. They sk for heavy damages, and at the same time admit
that they accrued by reason of their own illegal acts.
What is there in the nature of this suit that should exclude
the defence set up by the respondent?
What is the injury complained of? It is, as stated in the libel, -that the respondent,
"without any lawful cause or probable cause of suspicion,"
seized and took possession of the ship Admittance, her cargo,
and papers, and that the same were not brought nor sent within
the jurisdiction of any court of the United States for adjudication, and that the libellants "have been, for more than a -twelvemonth, deprived of the use, possession, management, and control of the said property," and that the same has been "illegally
sold and disposed of." The remedy pursued, is a proceeding
instituted to compel the respondent to bring in the property, and
proceed to adjudication, or in default thereof, that restitution in
value should be decreed againsthim. It is a very common pro.
ceeding in the admiralty courts, and by looking into its nature
and object, it will be perceived that the defence contended for.
is necessarily granted. It will be found that the mere failure
of a captor to proceed to adjudication, is not enough to entitle
a claimant to restitution in value, but that the court will look
back to the original cause of seizure, and if the claimant has
violated any law which rendered his property liable to condemnation, restitution in value will not be decreed.
Various authorities are cited to show that the distinction between the prize and instance side of the District Courts, as Courts
of Admiralty, has an important bearing upon this question.
It is stated, in the argument of the learned counsel, that "this
is a suit instituted on the instance side of t]e admiralty for an
alleged marine trespass," and also, "that ' it; is not a suit for damages." I would ask what is a decree of restitution in value,
but a decree of damages for a marine trespass ? And is the respondent, merely because th proceedings are instituted on the

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

507

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

instance side of the admiralty, to be ousted of his defence, and
not to be permitted to show that no trespass was committed.
What is a tort of which a court of admiralty has jurisdiction ?.
Vide Conkling's United States Admiralty, p. 21, where Judge
Story enumerates the different injuries redressed by a court of admiralty. See also, p. 334, 336, note a. The passages referred to
describe the various injuries for which legal redress can be obtained, and point out the particular rexaedies; and yet there is
nothing like a claim for damages because the property was not
cond6mned, but they refer to the legality or illegality of the
seizure; and in the last reference* :t is said, "if no proceeding
is instituted, as is sometimes the case when the captor himself
has become convinced of the -invalidity of the capture, or the
captured property has been lost by recapture or otherwise, the
injured party may, in such case, himself become the primary
actor, by calling on the captor to' proceed to adjudication, and
at the same time invoking the justice of the court to award damages, if the capture shall be adjudged to have been tortious ;
not because the captor had not proceedea'to adjudication.
In Wheaton on Captures, p. 280, sect. 18, the same redress is
pointed out. "If the captors omit or delay to proceed to the
adjudication of the property, any person claiming an interest in
the captured property may maintain a monitiofi against them,
citing them to proceed to adjudication, which, if they do not do,
or show cause why the property should be condemned, it will be
restored to the claimants proving an interest therein; and this
process is often resorted to when the property is lost or destroyed
through the fault or negligence of the captors, in order to obtain
a compensation in damages for the unjust seizure and detention."
In 2 Wheaton's Rep. App. p. 11, it is said, "If the captors
unjustifiably neglect to proceed to adjudication, the court will,
in case of restitution, decree demurrage against them," and cites
the Madonna del Burso, 4 Rob. 169; The C6rier Maratimo,
1 Rob. 287; The Peacock, 4 Rob. 185; The Anna Catherina,
6 Rob. 10.
Hence, whenever a restitution in value is decreed, it is upon
the ground that there would have been a restitution of the property valued, and no case cited by the learned counsel controverts this position.
(The counsel then proceeded to comment upon the following
cases: The Lucy, 3 Rob. 208; The Huldah, 3 Rob. 235; The
Madonna del Burso, 4 Rob. 169; The St. Juan Baptista, 5 Rob.
33 ; The Wilhelmsberg, 5 Rob. 143;. The Lively, 1 Gallison, 315;
The Felicity, 2 Dodson, 81; The Rover, 2 Gallison, 239.)
Various acts of Congress have been referred to to show that
it is the duty of a captor to-bring in captured property, and pro-

ceed to adjudication. This general principle, it has been before
stated, is admitted. It is not contended, in behalf of respondent,
that a captor may, at his pleasure, under a:ny circumstances, dis.
regard the injunctions of the law, omit to bring his prize into
court, convert-it into money, and retain it in his own hands.
The maintenance of such principles is not necessary to his defence in this suit.
But I would ask, is a veil to be thrown over the conduct of
the libellants or their agents? Is the fact to be kept out of
view, that the master of the Admittance sailed from New Orleans
with the intent to trade with the enemy, and did in fact trade
with the enemy?. Will this court aid an unworthy claimant?
"It is a good moral and legal principle, that a man must come
into a court of justice with clean hands, and that the law will
not lend its aid to a person setting up a violation of law on the
Wheaton on Captures, 225.
face of his claim."
The Anna Maria, 2 Wheaton, 328. Chief Justice Marshall
says: "To sustain the claim of the libellants, the first point to
be established is the fairness of the voyage;."
The Gran Para, 7 Wheaton, 483. "A claim founded on
piracy, or any other act, which, in the general estimation of
mankind, is held to be illegal or immoral, might, I presume, be
rejected in any court on that ground alone." And is not the
present claim founded on an illegal act? The demurrer admits
the illegal act, and yet the claim is for restitution.
The Bello Corrunes, 6 Wheaton, 169. "But can a citizen of
this country, who has violated its laws, ever be recognized in
our courts as a legal claimant of the fruits of his own wrong ?"
It will be perceived, by referring to the answer of the respondent, and the amendment to the answer, that the seizure may be
justified on two grounds: first, a trading with the enemy; and,
second, that it was the property of the enemy. The Rugen,
1 Wheaton, 74. It is important, in the view now about to be
taken, to ascertain the national character of the libellants. The
libel states they were neutrals, some of them subjects of the
Queen of Spain, and the others subjects of France. This is
denied by the answer, which avers that they were resident merchants of Mexico, conducting there a commercial establishment
a fact beyond dispute. "If a person has a residence in a liostile country, and conducts a commercial establishment there,
notwithstanding his place of birth, he wilt be considered a an
enemy in regard to his commercial operations." 1 Kent, 74, 75.
Then the libellants must be considered as belligerents, and this
must be taken as admitted by the demurrer.
Was condemnation necessary to divest the libellants of the
property?

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

lecker et al. v. Montgomery.

In Gelston v, Hoyt, 3 Wheaton, it was decided that a forfeiture attached in #em at the moment the offence was committed, and the property was instantly divested, so that no action
could be maintained for the subsequent seizure. This, it is said,
was a case of a statute forfeiture, and has no analogy to the

question under consideration; but it is submitted that it has an
important bearing, inasmuch as it shows that whatever may be
the subsequent conduct of a captor, an action cannot be main-,
tdined against him.
The Marg, 1 Gallison, 192.* In this case it will be found, that
upon principles of common law the following propositions were
discussed by Judge" Story:
1. What is the interest or right which attaches to the government in forfeitures of property, before any act done to vindicate
its claims ?
2. What is the operation of such act, done to vindicate its
claim, as to the offender and as to strangers?
And the conclusions he arrived at were 1st. "That an absolute property vested in the 'United States
when actuel seizure was made."
2d. " That, as against the offender or his representatives, upon
seizure, the title, by operation of law, relates back'to the time of
the offence, so as to avoid all mesne acts."
Then, upon the authoRty of this case, it is submitted, .thatthe
libellants were absolutely divested of their property upon the
commission of the 6ffence. A captor may destroy property.
1 Kent, 104. " Sometimes circumstances will not permit property captured at sea to be sent into port, and the captors in
such cases may either destroy it, or permit the original owner to
ransom it."
There are decisions to the effect that it requires a sentence
of condemnation to change the property, but this applies to a
neutral purchaser; as in the case of the Flad Oyen, (1 Rob. 117,)
the substance of which decision was, that the owner could have
*restitution of his property from, a neutral vendee, unless it had
been condemned to the captors; and the reason of this is obvious, the neutral purchaser 'can only take that which his condition of neutrality permits him. to take, ahd when he takes the
property without condemnation from the captors, he occupies
the position of a. captor, which is inconsistent with his neutrality.
In Goss v. Withers, (2 Burr. 694,) Lord Mansfield says, "9
the
property is not changed so as to bar the owner, in favor of a

tion," intimating that it is changed without condemnation so
as to bar the owner in a claim against the captor.
In 1 Kent, 101, it is said: " When a p:-ize is taken at sea, it
must be brought with due care into sorae convenient port for
adjudication by a competent court; though, strictly speaking,
as between the belligerent parties, the title passes and is vested
when the capture is complete; and "this question never arises
but between the original owner and a neutral purchasing from
the captor, and between the original owner and a re-captor."
The Adventure, 8 Cranch, 226. The Adventure was an
English snip, seized by the French. The French captors made
a donation of her to the 'crew of an American brig, who brought
her into Norfolk, and claimed her as their property, acquired by
the donation of the captors. Mr. Justice Johnson, in delivering
the opinion of this court, says: "As between the belligerents,
the capture undoubtedly produces a complete divestiture of pro.
perty."
Admitting. the principle supposed to be decided in the case
of Price v. Noble, (4 Taunt. 123,) to be Correct, that the property
was not changed, because there was a spes recuperandi,it would
not affect this case, the property having been brought infra presidia; and this may be also observed of the reference to 15 Vin.
Abr. 51.
In the case of Camden v. Home, (6 Bro. P. C., 2 H. B.) the
statute expressly vested the right in the captor after adjudication.
On these, grounds it is submitted that condemnation was not
necessary to divest the libellants of their property.
It is urged, in behadf of the libellants, that the government
has asserted and can assert no rights here; and if the defence
is held available, it will place the "whole proceeds of this valuable cargo in the pocket of the respondent." What will or will
not go into the pocket of the respondent, as a question not pertinent to the issues lreseoited by the record; but, it may be observed, that one half of the property in question, if lawful prize,
belongs to the government;, and upop the institution of this
suit it .asserted its rights so far as to employ counsel for the
respondent.
By directions from the Navy DepartmEnt, the proceeds of the
sale of the, ship and cargo were not distributed, but were sent
into the United States, and placed in the treasury, where they
Dnow are, a circumstance which, it 1s believed, was known to the
libellants; and if they had thought proper to institute proceedings calling. on the respondent to bring in the proceeds, they
would have been .forthcoming. The property has not been

f6illegally or unjustifiably" converted, and, under the authority
of the case of the Eole, (6 Rob. 224,) the proceeds are entitled to
the privilege of prize property, and subject to the judgment of
the court.
There is not a single circumstance, 'connected with this
seizure, which can justify the imputation of misconduct. For
reasons, which were conclusive in the mind of the respondent,
he directed an officer to board and seize the Admittance. Upon
the examination of her papers, it was at once seen that his reasons were well founded. The deceptive clearance, the erasures
upon the bills of lading, the false entries in. the log-book, the
position of the ship on the coast of Mexico when she had cleared
for Honolulu, were all circumstances indicating guilt. The subsequent testimony of the mate of the Admittance, that she had
been sailing under false colors, answering private signals given
from various points on the shore, receiving and answering
written communications, her name oni the stern c6ncealed with
canvas, the captain expressly avowing his intention of discharging his cargo at some port or place in possession of the enemy,
and expressing a fear of falling in with an Americah man-of-war,
affords the most conclusive evidence, that to have acted otherwise, the respondent would have been justly chargeable with a
violation of his duty.
The condition of the ship, the want- of stores, and' his inability to furnish a prize crew, rendered it impossible to send her
into any port of the United States, a state of things which had
been contemplated by the instructions he received from his
superior in command. He, therefore, proceeded to Monterey,
and libelled the ship in the aforementioned. court, which he had
every reason to believe was a competent tribunal. The papers
of the Admittance were there filed, and finally transmitted to
-the Navy Department, copies of which have been furnished the
pounsel of the libellants, and they are referred to and made a
part of the respondent's answer.
There are two grounds, either of which, if it is competent for
this court to consider, as the case is presented, must be conclusive against the libellants.
1st. What authority have the' libellants to appear and claim
an interest in the cargo? They were belligerents. .The libel
states that the cargo " was purchased by order of Messrs. Rnbio,
Brothers & Co., subjects of the Queen of Spain; the bills of
lading were made out in their name, and were subsequently indorsed and transferred to the libellants;. that "the cargo was
shipped at New Orleans in October, 1846." The answer avers
that Messrs. Rubio, Brothers & Co. were also belligerents, a fact
which cannot be denied. 'Then, how could they acquire pro-

perty by a purchase at New Orleans during the war? Was a
right of property ever vested in either Ruoio, Brothers & Co. or
the libellants? Vide I Kent, 67, and the authorities there cited.
2d. Does not the intervention of peace bar the claimants?
" Captured property remains in the same condition in which the
treaty finds it, and it is tacitly conceded to the possessor. The
intervention of peace cures all defects of title." 1 Kent, ch. 5,
111; ch. 8, 169.
The schooner Sophie, 6 Rob. 138. Sir William Scott says,
"I am of opinion that the title of the former owner is conjpletely
barred by the intervention of peace, which has the effect of
quieting all titles of possession 'arising from the war," and this
was decided in a causd where the captured vessel claimed had
not been condemned.
Upon these views, the respondent prays that so much of the
judgment of the Circuit Court as sustains the first demurrer may
be reversed, and that the residue of said judgment may be
affirmed with costs.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This case arises upon the capture of the ship Admittance
during the late war with Mexico, by the United States sloop of
war Portsmouth, commanded by Captain Montgomery.
The Admittance was an American vessel, and after war was
declared, sailed from New Orleans with a valuable cargo, shipped
at that place. " She cleared out for Honolulu, in the Sandwich
Islands; and was found by the Portsmouth at Saint Jose, on
the coast of California, trading, as it is alleged, with the enemy.
Before this capture was made, a prize court had been established at Monterey, in California, by the military officer, exercising the functions of governor of that province, which had been
taken possession of by "the American fcrces. A chaplain, belonging to one of the ships of war on that station, was appointed
Alcalde of Monterey, and authorized to exercise admiralty jurisdiction in, cases of capture. The court was established at the
request of Commodore Biddle, the naval commander on that
station, and sanctioned by the President of the United States,
upon the ground that prize crews could not be spared from the
squadron to bring captured vessels into a port of the United
States. And the officers of the squadron were ordered to carry
their prizes to Monterey, and libel them for condemnation-in the
court above mentioned, instead of sending them to the United
States.
In pursuance of this order the Admittance was carried to
Monterey, and condemned by the court as lawful prize; and the
vessel and cargo s6ld under this sentence. The seizure at Saint

Jose was made on the 7th of April, 1847, and the ship and cargo
condemned on the 1st of June, in the same year.
The oiler of the President, authorizing the establishment of the
court, required that the proceeds, arising from the sale of prizes,
should not be distributed, until a copy of the record was sent to
the Navy Department, and orders in relation to the prize-n'oney
received from the secretary. No order appears to have been
given in this case, and it would be presumed, from the pleadings,
that it is still in the custody of the commander of the Portsmouth. It has, however, been stated in the argument, and we
understafid is admitted, that the money was sent to the United
States, and placed in the custody of the Treasury Department,
where it still remains. But it is not material.in this case to inquire, whether it is still in possession of Captain Montgomery,
or in the custody of the Secretary of the Treasury.- It could
not, in either case, affect the decision. Thig is the case as it appears on the record, and admissions in the argument. Itcomes
before the court on the following pleadings.
The claimants, on the 6th of June, 1.848, filed a libel in the.
Admiralty Court for the -District of Columbia, against the captor, stating that they were the owners of the cargo of the Admittance; that they were subj'ects of Spain, and neutrals in the
war between this country and Mexico; that the Admittance
sailed on a lawful voyage; that the vessel and cargo were seized
at Saint Jose by Captain Montgomery as prize of war, without any lawful or probable cause; that the vessel and cargo
were not brought to the United States, nor proceeded against
as prize of war in any court having jurisdiction to adjudicate
upon the lawfulness of the capture, but were unlawfully sold
and disposed of by Captain Montgomery, who thereby. had put
it out of his power to proceed to any lawful adjudication upon
the legality of the capture, and had thus made himself a trespasser ab initio, independently of any lawful or'probable cause
for the original seizure. They pray, therefore, that he- may'be
compelled to bring the cargo within' the jurisdiction of the
court, or of some other court of the United States, and institute
proceedings against the property, and show that there was lawful
or probable cause for the seizure, and have the same adjudicated
upon by some court of the United States having full jurisdiction
in the matter; and that restitution of the goods or the value
thereof may be awarded to the libellanits, with damages for the
unlawful seizure.
Captain' Montgomery appeared and answered, and admitted
that, as commander of the United States ship Portsmouth, be
seized and took the Admittance at Saint Jose as lawful prize;
and justifies the seizure upon the ground that she sailed from

SUPREME COURT.
Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

New Orleans with the design of trading with the enemy; that
she did in fact hold illegal intercourse with them, and discharged
a part of her cargo at Saint Jose. And the respondent exhibits with his ahswer, and as a part of it, sundry papers received
from Peter Peterson, the master of the Admittance, together with
her log-book-and the deposition of her mate.
The respondent further states that it was impossible for him,
consistently with the public interests, to send the Admitance to
any port of the United States; and that he carried her before
the prize court hereinbefore mentioned, at Monterey, where she
was condermned with her cargo as lawful prize; and exhibits
the proceedings of that court as a part of his answer, and relies
on this condemnation as a bar to the present proceedings on
behalf of the claimants.
To this answer the libellants put in two demurrers.
1. To so much of the answer as relies upon the condemnation at Monterey as a bar.
2. To so much of the answer as relies upon the acts of the captain and crew of the Admittance as a justification for the seizure
of the ship or cargo as lawful prize of war. or furnishing probable
cause for seizure; and, as the ground for this demurrer, avers
that the Admiralty Court for the District of Columbia had no
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the question of prizes or probable cause. of seizure, as the property was not within its control,
and could not be brought within it in consequence of the sale
in California. The respondent joined in these demurrers.
After these issues in law had been joined, the respondent, by
leave of the court, amended his answer, averring in the amendment that the libellants, at the time of the shipment at New Orleans and at the time of the seizure, were domiciled in Mexico
and conducting a commercial establishment in that country;
and also, that the libellants were the owners of only a small portion of the cargo. But there is no replication to this amend.ment, nor'is it embraced in the issues of law made by the demurrers. The omission to dispose of it, however, forms no objection to this appeal, as the judgment of the Circuit Court was
final, and disposed of the whole &ese, independently of these
new allegations.
In this state of the pleadings, a decree-was entered in the
District Court sustaining both of the demurrers, and directing
the respondent to bring the cargo within the jurisdiction of some
District Court of the United States, and institute proceedings
against it as prize of war, on or before the day mentioned in
the decree; and that in default thereof the libelIants should
recover its value.
This decree was entered pro fornid in "order to bring the case

before the Circuit Court, to which the respondent accordingly
appealed. And upon the argument in the last-mentioned court,
the first demurrer was sustained, and the decree of the District
Court in that respect affirmed; but so much of the decree as
sustained the demurrer to the answer of the respondent, averring
sufficient probable cause for the seizure of the cargo, was reversed,
and a finaldecree upon that ground rendered against the libellants.
From this decree both parties have appealed to this court.
In relation to the proceedings in the court at Monterey, which
is the subject of the first demurrer, the decision of the Cix'cuit
Court is correct.
All captures jure belli are for the benefit of the sovereign under whose authority they are made; and the validity of thc seizure and the question of prize or no prize can be determined in
his own courts only, upon which he has conferred jurisdiction to
try the question. And under the Constitution of the United
States the judicial power of the general government is vested in
one, Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress
shall from time to time ordain and establish. Every court of
the United States, therefore, must derive its jurisdiction and judicial authority from the Constitution or the laws of the United
States. And neither the President nor any military officer can
establish a court in a conquered country, and authorize it to decide upon the rights of the United States, or of individuals in
prize cases, nor to administer the laws of nations.
The courts, established or sanctioned in Mexico during the
war by the commanders of the American forces, were nothing
more than the agents of the military power, to assist it in preserving order in the conquered territory, and to protect the inhabitants in their persons and property while it was occupied by
the American arms. They were subject to the military power,
and their decisions under its control, whenever the commanding
officer thought proper to interfere. They were not courts of the
United States, and had no right to adjudicate upon a question
6f prize or no prize. And the sentence of condemnation in the
court at Monterey is a nullity, and can have no effect upon the
rights of any party.
The -econd demurrer denies the authority of the District
Court to adjudicate, because the property had not been brought
within its jurisdiction. But that proposition cannot be maintained; and a prize court, when a proper case is made for its interposition, will proceed to adjudicate and condemn the captured
property or award restitution, although it is not actually in the
control of the court. It may always proceed in rem whenever
the prize or proceeds of the prize can be traced to the hands of
any person whatever.

516

SUPREME COURT.
Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

As a general rule, it is the duty of the captor to bring it within
the jurisdiction of a prize court of the nation to which he
belongs, and to institute proceedings to have it condemned.
This is required by.the act of Congress in cases of capture by
ships of war of the United States; and this act merely enforces
the performance of *a duty imposed upon the captor by the law
of nations, which in all civilized countries secures to the captured a trial in a court of competent jurisdiction before he can
finally be deprived of his property.
But there are cases where, from existing circumstancei, the
captor may be eiccused from the performance of this duty, and
may sell or otherwise dispose of. the property before condemnation.. And where the commander of a national ship cannot,
without weakening inconveniently the force under his 6ommand, spare a sufficient prize crew to man the captured vessel;
or where the orders of hi government prohibit him from doing
so, he may lawfully sell. or otherwise dispose of the captured
property in a foreign county; and may afterwards proceed to
adjudication in a court of the United States. - 4 Or. 293; 7 Id.
423; 2 Gall. 368; 2 Wheat. App. 11, 16; 1 Kent's Com. 359;
6 Rob. 138, 194, 229, 257.
But if no sufficient cause is shown to justify the sale, and the
conduct of the captor has been unjust and oppressive, the court
may refuse to adjudicate upon the validity of the capture, and
award restitution and damages against the captor, although the
seizure as prize was originally lawful, or made upon probable cause.
And the same rule prevails where the sale was justifiable,
and the captor has delayed, for an unreasonable time, to institute'
proceedings to condemn it. Upon a libel filed by tl~e captured,
.as for a marine trespass, the court will refuse to award a monition to proceed to adjudication on the question of prize or no
prize, but will treat the captor as a wrongdoer from the beginning.
But, in the case before us, sufficient cause for capture and
condemnation is stated in the answer; and the reason assigned
therein is a full justification for not sending the Admittance and
her cargo to the United States. And as to the delay, he had
reasonable ground for believing that no further proceedings were
necessary after the condemnation at Monterey. The court had
been constituted with the sanction of the executive department
-of the government, under whose orders he .was acting; and it
had condemned the vessel and cargo as prize, and ordered them
to be sold. And if, as seems to be conceded in the argument, the
proceeds were paid over to the government to await its further
orders, and still remain in its hands, certainly no laches or
neglect of duty in any respect can be imputed to the respondent.

DECEMBER TERM, 1851.

517

Jecker et al. v. Montgomery.

Inasmuch, therefore, as the answer alleges i sufficient cause
for selling the property before condemnation,'and also for not
proceeding against it in a court of competent jurisdiction, the
respondent has forfeited none of the rights which he acquired
by the capture. And, as the District Court had jurisdiction, the
second demurrer ought to have bepn overruled, and an order
passed directing Captain Montgomery to institute proceedings
by a certain day to condemn the property, (giving him reasonable time,) and that, upon his failure to comply with the order,
the court should proceed on the libel filed against him for a marine trespass, and award such damages as the libellants might
show themselves entitled to demand.
The necessity of proceeding to condemnation as prize, does not
arise from any distinction between the Instance Court of Admimiralty and,the Prize Court. In England, they-are different
courts; and, although the jurisdiction of each of them is always
exercised by the same person, yet he holds the offices by different
commissions. But, under the Constitution of the United States,
the Instance Court of Admiralty and the Prize Court of Admiralty are the same court, acting under one commission. Still, how.
ever, the property cannot be condemned as prize, upon this libel;
nor would its dismissal be equivalent to a condemnation, nor recognized as such in foreign courts. The libellants allege that the
goods were neutral, and not liable to capture; and their right to
them cannot be divested until there is a sentence of condemnation
against them as prize of war. And, as that sentence cannot be
pronounced in the present form of, the proceeding, it becomes
necessary to proceed in the prize jurisdiction of the court, where
the property may be condemned or acquitted by the sentence of
the court, and the whole controversy be finally settled. 4 Cr.

101, 102; 6 Rob. 48; 3 Id.192; 2 Gall. 368; 2 Id.240.
But the Circuit Court erred in giving final judgment against
the libellants, upon the ground that the answer showed probable
grounds for the seizure. The question of probable cause is not presented in the present stage of the proceedings, and cannot arise
until the validity of the capture is determined. If it turn out,
upon the final hearing upon the question of prize or no prize, that
the vessel and cargo were liable to capture and condemnation, it
would necessarily follow that there was not only probable cause,
but good and sufficient cause, for the seizure. And if, on the
contrary, it should be found that they were not liable to capture,
as prize of war, the libellants would be entitled to restitution, or
the value in damages, although the strongest probabilities appeared against them at the time of the seizure. Probable cause
or not becomes material only where restitution is awarded, and
