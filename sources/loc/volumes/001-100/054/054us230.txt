of Alabama, a party to any security for the payment of mbney,
who takes more than after the rate of eight per cent. per annum
for the money advanced, is prohibited fror recovering any interest, and can have judgment only for the original sum loaned.
And this abatement, was the matter in controversy. To prove
the usury, Hill, the drawer, and William Bower, one of the
drawees, were introduced on behalf of the defendant; and objected to by the plaintiff as incompetent, on the ground that a
party to negotiable paper who, by the sanction of his name, gave
It credit and currency, could not afterwards, upon his own testimony, invalidate the instrument, by .showiag that the consideration on which it was executed was illegal. The witnesses
were rejected.
Both Iill and Bower were offered to prove facts which, when
taken in connection with additional facts, that might be proved
by others, would invalidate the instrument in part, by abating
the interest. The proof was offered, and only material to es ablish the defence of usury, this being the sole defence. It mL st
be admitted, that if the party to the bill had been introduced to
establish the whole defence, then he was incompetent; and to,
hold, that he could prove a defence in part, -ithout which piece
of evidence no successful defence could be made, would be a
mere evasion of the rule, which excludes such witness from giving evidence to impeach the consideration.
No other question is presented to us, nor does any other exist
in the record, worthy of notice. It is therefo-e ordered, that the
judgment of the Circuit Court be affirmed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record,
from the District Court of the United States for the Mriddle
District of Alabama, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this
court, that the judgrtent of the said District Court in this cause
be, and the same is hereby affirmed with costs and damages, at

representations as to the quantity and quality of the land, and also, as to a lien
which he professed to have for taxes which he had paid; and finally bought the
land for agrossly inadequate price, the sale will be set aside.

THis was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Maine, sitting as a court of equity.
The facts are all stated in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by .11r. Fessenden, for the appellants, and Mr.

.To'we, for the appellee.
The points made by the counsel for the appellants were the
following, viz.:
The complainants claim to have their deed to Black, dated
November 30,1846, cancelled, and a reconveyance of said estate,
on the following grounds.
1. For fraud and fraudulent representations.
2. For inadequacy of price, ag, of itself, furnishing evidence
of fraud.
3. For the two preceding grounds united.
General Considerations. The acts and declarations of Black,
to show he had formed a design to commit frauds in making
this purchase, as opportunity should offer.
All such acts and declarations of Black made to other persons,
about the time of the transaction, are competent evidence for
complainants, for that purpose. Bradley v. Chase, 22 Maine
Rep. 511; Warner v. Daniels, 1 Woodb. & Minot, R. 9.0; Wood
v. The United States, 16 Pet. R. 342; s. c. 14 Pet. R. 430.
Complainants rely on the testimony of the Vermont witnesses,
viz.: Edward F. Putnam, Albert G. Soule, E. P. Soule, and
Phebe Hendricks, to prove such acts and declarations of Black.
First Proposition. The bill, answer, and evidence, establish
complainants' proposition of fraud, on the part of Black, in
several particulars, either of which is sufficient to entitle them to
a decree in their favor.
1. As to complainants' title and the evidence of it, and Black's
misrepresentations concerning it.
2. Black's misrepresentations as to the number of acres.
3. Blacli's misrepresentations as to incumbrances on the land,
and particularly of his lien thereon for taxes, alleged to have
been paid by himself.
4. Black's misrepresentations of the value of the land.
(Each one of these points was examined according to the
evidence.)
Second Proposition. The doctrine is well stated in Story's
Commentaries on Equity Jur. §§ 245 and 246. After tating the
general proposition that mere inadequacy is not a sufficient
ground for relief, he says, (sect. 246,) "Still, however, there may

232

SUPREME COUIT.
Tyler et ux. v. Black.

be such unconscionableness, or inadequacy in a bargain, as to
demonstrate some gross imposition, or undue influence; and in
such cases, courts of equity ought to interfere upon the satisfactory ground of-fraud. But then, such unconscionableness, or
such inadequacy, should be made out as would, to use an expressive phrase, shock the conscience, and amount, in itself, to
conclusive and decisive evidence of fraud. And where there
are other ingrediefits in the case of a suspicious nature, or peculiar relation between the parties, gtbss inadequacy of price must
necessarily furnish the most vehement presumption of fraud."
The same doctrine is stated in Fonb. Eq. B. 1, c. 2, sect. 9,
note e.
"Where the deed is executed, if the parties have not been on
equal footing, or, if there'has been any concealment, or misrepresentation, or imposition, courts of equity uniformly set aside
such deed or contract." Sug. Vend. 6th Amer. ed. p. 317, and
no* 2.
tWhere the circumstances of the case are such as have afforded-an opportunity, either rom the situation or condition of the
parties, or the ndture of the property, for either of them to take
a fraudulent advantage of the other, and the consideration is
grossly inadequate, this court considers that circumstance to be
evidence of fraud, and will not only refuse a specific performance at the instance'of the former, but will, at the suit of the
*latter, rescind the transaction." Jer. Eq. Jurisd. 483, and notes.
"A conveyance, obtained for an inadequate consideration, froti
one not conusant of his right, by a person who has notice of such
right, will be set aside, although no actual fraud or imposition
be used." 'Sug. Vend. 6th Amer. ed. 320.
"Although iimay be impossible, by any general proposition, to
define what is to be understood by gross inadequacy of consideration, as it must, in a great measure, depend upon the circumsiances of each individual case in which tie question may arise,
yet, if it be so gross and palpable, as of itself to afford evidence
of actual fraud, the court will set aside a sale." Jer. Eq. Jur. 433,
(note 7); Osgood v. Franklin, 2 Johns. Ch. 1, and cases cited.
'InTurner v. Harvey, 1 Jacob's Ch. R. 139, which was a case
where the vendors were ignorant of a fact or circumstance considerably increasing the value, the court say: " If a word, a
single word be dropped which tends to mislead the vendor,-the
principle that the purchaser is not bound to give the vendor
information as to the value of the property, will not be allowed
to operate."
Again, in Hill on Trustees, 152, it is said, "Mere inadequacy,
of itself, is not enough to set aside a contract; but where'the
inadequacy is so gross that it is impossible to state it fo a ma

-

Tyler et ux. v. Black.
of common sense, without producing an exclamation as to the
inequality of it, the court will infer, from that fact alone, that
there must have been such imposition, or oppression in the transaction, as to amount to a case of fraud, from which- it would
not suffer any benefit or advantage to be derived. Other circumstances of fraud will aid the court."
To apply these principles to the case at bar.
The inadequacy'of price, in this case, is such, as of itself, to
afford evidence of fraud. In 1799 Parsons conveyed to Putnam
for 50 cents an acre. Black paid Tyler aid wife 81 cents an acre.
Black, in his answer, says that it was worth from 50 cents
to $2 per acre, November 80, 1846. Now 50. cents to $2
averages $1.25 per acre; so that Black purchased for 8,1 cents an
acre what he admits was worth $1.25 an acre. He bought for
$50 what he admits was worth $757.50.
Third Proposition. The bill may be sustained on the ground
of fraud and fraudulent representation, and for inadequacy of
price, united.
On these principles the court will find a rule for their guidance in Seymour v. Delancey, -6 Johns. Ch. R. 222. Chancellor
Kent, in that case, found it convenient to take the average
value, as established by the witnesses on the one side and the
other.
On this principle the land was worth about $4.45 an acre, or
$2,688.36, in November, 1846, date of deed of Tyler and wife
o Black.
The denials df the answer are thus overcome, and the bill is
maintained.
The counsel for the defendant in error made the following
points, viz.:
The court has no jurisdiction. The value of the matter in
controversy is one of the points at issue in the case. The proofs
fail to show the land to be Worth $2,000. It is not worth over
60 cents per acre, as shown by respondent's witnesses.
(The arguments upon this point upon both sides depend so'
entirely upon references to the testimony, that they cannot be
reported.)
Point 2. There was no inadequacy of price.
The inadequacy, to be evidence of fraud, must be so gross as
to shock the conscience. 1 Story's Eq. Jur. §§ 244, 245, 246; 1
Sugd. Vend. [#422, 423,] 318, 319, and cases there cited. Here
is, no satisfactory proof of such inadequacy as would even
amount to damage. 1 Story's Eq. Jur. § 203. The consideration, on Black's part, was the $100 paid, the amount due for
taxes and interest, and his claim for trouble and expenses, in -dis20*

covering and notifying the heirs. There is no sufficient proof
now (as before shown) that all which Black takes by his deed
is worth more than that. At the time of the contract it was
doubtful how much he would take by his deed, or whether he
would take any thing.
It was not then fully ascertained whether Dr. Putnam died
qeized of any portion of this lot; and it was not known of how
n "ch, if any. It was not even known that Parsons had sold
lain. any land, or if any, how much. The extent of Mrs. Tyler's
rights, as heir at law, was not dearly ascertained. The value
of- the land was unknown. Defendant had no information 11ut
that derived from Mrs. Sheldon, and Tilden, and from +i 5
Putnapms.
Where neither of the parties knows the value of the estate,
no inadequacy of consideration can operE.te, even to prevent a
decree for specific performance in favor-of the purchaser. Anon.
cited in 1 Bro. C. C. 158, and 6 Yes. Jr. 24; 1 Sugd. Vend.
['441, 442,] 318.
Point 3. There was no fraudulent concealment.
A purchaser is under no obligation to give any information,
.unless there be some relation of confidence between the parties.
2 Kent's Com. (5th ed.) 490. By Lord Thurlow, in Fox v,
Macreth, 2 Bro. C. C. 420 ;'Laidlaw v. Organ, 2 Wheat. 178;
1 Story's Eq. Jur. sect. 207.
The parties to this contract were strangers to each other; The
complainants are persons of intelligence, and in "comfortable
circumstances."
Black offered to communicate every thing for a reasonable
compensation; and the offer was made at the commencement
of the conversation, and repeated afterwards. Tn fact there wd§
no concealment.
Before the execution of the deed the complainants were informed of every fact, known to the defendant, in relation to the
land and their title thereto.
It is too late for complainants to take advantage of any concealment during the negotiation, they having executed the deed
after all the facts were fully disclosed.

Point 4. There was no misrepresentation.
The testimony of E. F. Putnam and others, as to the representations made to them at Fairfield, is irrelevant and inadmissible. The interrogatories, which called it out, were objected to.
If admissible, it is discredited by the evident bias and strong
feeling of the witnesses; by their mutual contradictions, in rela-

tion to Black's denial of knowledge of the quantity of land, and
his statements in relation to the nutrier of acres, the price of
land sold, the place searched for papers, &c.; and by their statement that Black said Mfrs. Tyler was dead, which contradicts
the case as settled by bill and answer.
Black did not represent that he had a tax-title, or a-lien on
the land. The charge is inconsistent in its several pa'ts, and
with complainants' proof. The claim, which he set up, was
the claim which the answer shows that he had, an equitable
one on the owners of the land, and not a legal charge on
the land itself. He made no representation as to the number of
acres.
This charge is not made the subject of a particular interrogatory, but is covered by interrogatories 7 and 16; and is denied
in the answer.
Black stated that he "did not know how many acres belonged
to said Aaron Putnam ;" he could not have known. The statement of the number of acres, if made, was a mere matter of
opinion, so understood by all parties, and there is no evidence
that it was insincere.
A misrepresentation must be of something more than a mere
matter of opinion. 1 Story's Eq. Jur. 179; Hepburn v. Dunlop,
I Wheat. 179.
The representation, if made, was not material. The land in
itself is worthless; the only value is the timber. The number
of acres gives no idea of the quantity of- that. About the timber there were no representations made and no inquiries. It
was no inducement to the sale. The bill contains no averment that it was an inducement; (see p. 627); no denial of its
truth; no interrogatory in relation to it; no averment that the
complainants believed it. It was not regarded as evidence of
the value of the land sold by either party, for Tyler afterwards
inquired again as to the character and value, and Black declared
he knew nothing about it. The only inducement specifically
charged is the doubt as to Mrs. Tyler's title. The only unfairness in relation to the value of the land charged against Black
is the withholding information. He said that Tilden's part of
the lot was purchased at a shilling per acre, and not at twelve
and a half cents, as charged. Tilden paid a shilling. Black so
stated at Fairfield; the Soules interpolated the word "York ;"
Stanwood borrows the story and reduces the York shilling to
Federal currency.
500 acres at 12 cents,= $62.50, incumbered by tax claims
for about $300. The story is incredible, and inconsistent withthe propositions made by Black. What Black did say was not
thus incredible or inconsistent, for Stanwood believed hirn, and

236

SUPREM1E COURT.
Tyler et ux. v. Black.

thought a doubtful title to half the land worth more than he
asked for his information.
Black's representations of his inducements to purchase are
not shown to be false; and, if they were, that would furnish no
grounds for rescinding the contract.
A purchaser is under no legal obligation to maice a true disclosure of his motives. Vernon v. Keys, 12 East, 632, 637, 639.
Point 5. The misrepresentation must be of something, in regard to which the party places known trust and confidence in the
other. If the party had no right to place reliance upon it, and
it was his own folly to give credence to it, it will not avoid the
contract. 1 Story's Eq. Jur. sects. 197, 199.
Before any of the representations complained of were made,
Black assured Dr. Tyler that. he would give no information
whatever, unless paid therefor; and repeatedly made the same
assurance to him, in substance, in reply to his pressing questions. If, after that, Dr. Tyler relied upon anything, wrung from
the defendant by his importunate inquiries, it was a folly, from
the consequences of which a court of equity will not relieve him.
Point 6. Before they executed the deed, the complainants
knew where the land is situated, and where the evidence of their
title is recorded, and could have ascertained whether the representations madd by Black were true.
If Black made all the representations charged in the bill, they
then knew that some of them were untrue, and were put on their
guard as to the rest.
Misrepresentation of a matter, where a party was capable of
seeing whether it was right or not, is no ground for relief.* Ainslie v. Medlycot, 9 Yes. 13; 1 Madd. Ch. 253; Bayley v. Merrel,
Cro. Jac. 386 ; 3 Bulstr. 95; 1 Story's Eq. Jur. sect. 149 ; 2 Kent's
Com. 485, 486, note d.
The deceit must be such as ordinary prudence would not profeet the party against. 1 Story's Eq. Jur. sect. 200, a.
Point 7. Black's claim on account of taxes paid, &c., is valid
in foro conscientie. Complainants will not be entitled in equity
to the relief prayed for, until provision is made for that claim.
They have never offered to pay him if lie would rescind the
contract; nor even requested him to rescind. The bill containp
no such offer. The parties cannot be placed in statu quo.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Maine, sitting as a court of equity.
The complainants, Tyler and -wife, filed their bill to set aside
a sale of land made by them to Black, upon the ground of fraud,
concealment, and fraudulent representations made to them by

DECEMbER TERM, 1851.
Tyler et ux. v. Black.

Black; and also upon the ground of inadequacy of price ns
furnishing evidence-of fraud.
Towards the latter end of the last century, the State of Massachusetts ,established a lottery for the sale of some lands in
Maine; and one Zenos Parsons drew a prize of 1920 acres,
being lot number one in township No. 33.
On the 25th oftMarch, 1799, Parsons conveyed to Aaron
Putnam, of Charlestown, Massachusetts, for the consideration
of six hundred dollars, twelve hundred and twelve acres of the
said land, being an undivided interest. Putnam had three
children, two sons, and a daughter. The daughter married
Tyler, and they were:-the complainants and appellants in the
present cause. One of the sons died without issue, and the
other son left two children, viz., Edward and Elizabeth, who
married Soule, who resided in Fairfield, Vermont.
At the time of the-death of Aaron Putnam, his daughter was
a minor, and resided in Massachusetts. When the transaction
occurred which gave rise to the present suit, she was residing
with her husband, Tyler, at Hopkinton, in New Hampshire.
Black resided near the land in Maine, and had acted as the
agent of the owner of the remaining undivided interest for upwards of twenty years.
In November, 1846, Black %vexU to Fairfield, in Vermont, and
offered to purchase the share of Edward and Elizabeth, who
were ignorant of their title to the land; but they refused to
sell. Black there learned that Tyler and his wife were the
owners of one half of the 1212 acres which had been conveyed
by Parsons to Putnam, and immediately proceeded to Hopkifnton to see them. At this time Black's position was-this: he
resided at the town of Ellsworth, which communicated, by a
navigable stream, with the land in question; he had been connected, since 1833, with his father, John Black, in the business
of agency for the proprietors of nearly all the lots in the town-'
ships in which the land in question was situated; and in the
seasons of 1844-1 and 1845-6 there had been lumbering
operations upon lands in the neighborhood.
The interview between Black and Tyler is thus described by
Joseph Stanwood in his deposition.
1"I was
Second. To the second interrogatory he saith:
present at the public house when ir. Black came here and took
the deed, as before stated; my father-in-law and I were then
keeping a public house; Mr. Black came in and inquired for
man was he, and whatt were his
Doctor Tyler; what sort of &C
circumstances as to property; I told him he whs a physician,
doing a tolerable good share of business; had his house and
other buildings clear of debt, as I supposed."

238

SUPREME COURT.
Tyler et ux. v. Black.

Third. To the third interrogatory he saith :-" I was not
present at the commencement of the interview betwixt Tyler
and Black; I left the room soon after Tyler came in; after they
had been together perhaps an hour, Tyler came out and told,
in substance, that Black and he had been talldng about some
land in Maine; I went into the room with them; Black said
there'vas a tract of land in Maine, and he could find no person
that had any claim to it, unless it belonged to the heirs of
Doctor Putnam; Black said he would give Tyler fifty dollars
for a deed of the land from Tyler and his wife ; or, if they would
give him fifty dollars, he would tell' them all he knew about the
land; they came to -no agreement at that time, but separated
late at night; the next morning Black said he had concluded
to make Tyler another offer for the land; he would give him
one hundred dollars for a deed; I went to Doctor Tyler, told
what Black had offered, and he came in and concluded to
take it.
Fourth. To the fourth interrogatory he saith:-" The inquiries in the first part of this interrogatory were not made, if
made at all, in my presence, but I inferred from their conversation that these questions had been settled before I came into the
room; Black represented that the land was situated in a township, and gave the number of the township, but refused to name
the county; when the deed was made, he directed me to insert
a different number from that he had represented in the previous
conversation; he either represented that -the township in which
the land was situated was thirty-one, and directed me to insert
thirty-three in the deed, or represented thirty-three as the number of the township, and had thirty-one inserted in the deed, but
which I cannot now recollect.
Fifth. To the fifth interrogatory he saiti: - " That Black
said the land was holden, if held at all, by virtue of a lottery
ticket, the form of which he attempfed to describe; it was made
of pasteboard or thick paper, as I understood; he said he had
lately seen one in the hands of a Mr. Webster, I think, but I
am not certain about the name; Black said he had made many
inquiries about the title to this land; he had been to Springfield, Mass., and other places, for this purpose, but could find no
record of the title any where; and he did aot suppose there was
any deed of this land 'on record, but that the whole claim to it
depended upon the lottery ticket, and that alone.
Sixth. To the sixth interrogatory he saith :-" When Tyler
inquired how many acres Doctor Putnam owned, Black angwer,
ed, about five hundred."
Seventh. To the seventh interrogatory he saith :-" Black
said he had a claim on this land for the taxes he had paid on

it; he said he had paid taxes on this land twenty-eight or
twenty-nine years; think he said twenty-nine years; .the amount
I do not recollect, if he stated it; he said Tyler must pay him
the amount of these taxes, and twenty-five per cent. interest, at
all events, before he could avail himself of any title to this land,
and this he required in addition to the fifty dollars mentioned in
my answer to the third interrogatory; he said he would have
the land sold for taxes, and get'a good title."
Eighth. To the eighth interrogatory he saith :-" I do not recollect that Black represented what was the value of this particular piece of land, but he said a part of the same tracthad been sold
for twelve and a half cents per acre, and was still undivided; so
that if Tyler should ever be able to find and get possession of
the land, he would find himself an owner m- common with
others, and it would become necessary for him to get a division
before he could do any thing with the land; he said a road had
been, or would be, laid out through this township, which would
much increase the ,taxes; he assigned as a reasorf why he
wished to purchase the land, that another person had appeared
and claimed a large part of it, and he thought it was best for
him to be looking out for the remainder; and he had traced it
back to Doctor Putnam, and had not found that he had parted
with his title; till this claim was made to a part of the land, he
had supposed he was in quiet possession, and that the claimants
were all dead.
q
p
Ninth. To the ninth interrogatory he saith :-" Black's first
offer was fifty dollars, and he did not vary from this till the
morning, when he offered one hundred dollars; whether he professed to be liberal or not I do not recollect, but said it was all
he would give till the morning."
Tenth. -To the tenth interrogatory he saith: -" Black said he
could have had the land sold for taxes, and obtained a title that
way; I asked him why he had not done so; he said he was
afraid other speculators would come in and trouble him, or get
the land; I think he mentioned Norcross."
Eleventh. To the eleventh interrogatory he saith -" I made
the deed for Tyler and his wife to sign; .when I commenced
writing the deed, Black took from his pocket a memorandum,
and dictated to me a description of the land, and caused me to
use words different from those I should have used; he then, for
the first time, gave the name of the county in which the land is
situated, and the number of the township, which was different
from the number he had before given, as I have before stated in
my answer to the fourth" interrogatory; and he disected me to
put in a much larger sum for the consideration in the deed than
he gave Tyler, which I did."

SUPREME COURT.
Tyler et ux. v. Black.

It appeared afterwards, in evidence, thiat the deed from Par.
sons to Putnam was on record in the office for registering deeds
for land in Hancock county, kept in the town of Ellsworth; and
it also appeared that Black had no lien upon the land for taxes
paid by him.
In December, 1846, Edward Putnam wrote to Tyler giving
an account of Black's visit to hin" and his ineffectual efforts to
purchase his share of the land.
In June, 1847, Tyler and wife filed their bill against Black in
the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maine.
It set out their title; averred their entire ignorance of it until
informed by Black; charged that he had deceived them by false
rqpresentations as to their title, and as to the character, quantity,
and value of. the land, and .also by setfing up false pretensions
to a lien upon it held by him on account of his-having paid the
taxes. The bill further charged tha the land was heavily
covered with timber, which could easily be carried to market,
and was worth twenty thousand dollars; and that confiding in
the fraudulent representations of Black, -they had been induced
to7 sell it for the grossly inadequate consideration of one hundred dollars.
In October, 1849, Black filed his answer. He admitted the
title of th e complainants, his interview with them; their allegatioln to him of their ignorance respecting their title; his agency
for lands in the neighborhood; but he denied ever having been
upon that particular lot, or that he had caused an exploration of it
to be made, or that he had any particular knowledge of it; denied
that he had ever claimed to have a title or lien for taxes paid;
averred that in 1844, or 1845, he accidentally learned that Tilden,.(whom he had supposed to be the owner of the whole lot
and for whom he had been the agent,) was the owner of only
an undivided part, and that thereupon he had examined the
records of the registery of deeds for Hancock county, for the purpose of ascertaining in whom the title was vested, but could
find nothing there relative to it. That he then examined a planbook, and there found the name of Zenos Parsons, Springfield,
set down against this lot as the owner cf it; that in the summer of 1846 he was ififormed by Tilden that said Parsons conveyed to one Dr. Putnam, of Charlestown, a part of this lot.
Both the bill and answer contained other particulars, which it
is not necessary to mention. Much evidence was taken under
commissions.
At September term, 1849, the cause came up for hearing upon
the bill, answer, pleadings, and evidence, when the Circuit Court
-dismissed the bill, and the complainants appealed to this court.
In the argument of the cause here it was insisted by the coun-

241

Tyler et ux. v. Bldck.

sel for the defendant' that this court had not jurisdiction, as it
did not appear in the evidence that the value of the land in controversy was enough to justify the appeal. We think other.
wise; one of the witnesses gives an exaggerated estimate, and
others not enough to enable us to say what the value of the land
is; but the exploration, made at the instance of the complainants,
satisfies us that the land for its timber alone, if it had no -other
uses, is worth more than two thousand dollars.
If we look too at its value at the time when Black bargained
for it, we think it must be admitted that the sum which he
offered and which the complainants accepted upon his representations, was an inadequate price.
But the ground upon which we shall put this case is, that
the defendant did not act fairly in the representations made
by him to the complainants of the quantity and quality of the
land, and in his statement to them that he had a claim upon the
land for taxes, which was not true. The quantity of the land
is larger than he said it was, and from his agency for -the
owner of a part of it for many years, and his knowledge how
the title was acquired, he must have known what the grant
called for. In representing it to be less, he could only have
done so to diminish, in the view Of the complainants, its value.
The untruth in regard to his claim for taxes, without any thing
else, is sufficient for us to cancel the deed for a fraudulent misrepresentation.
Stanwood's testimony has been given in detail, because, it
corresponds with the averments in the bill, and is confirmed in
all essential particulars by the admissions of the defendant in
his answer, especially in two, which we think decisive of the decree which ought to be made in this case. Those are the defendant's repeated misrepresentations, made at different times and
to different persons, and to these complainants when he was bargaining with them for the land, as to the quantity, and his misstatements concerning the taxes paid upon it by his father and
himself for many years, especially used by him to the complainant as an inducement for him to sell the land for the small sum
-%hich he offered for it.
It cannot be doubted that the defendant knew, when he went
to Fairfield to buy this land, where he learned that the wife of
this complainant was a daughter of Aaron Putnam, that he
knew the latter's interest in the Parsons grant exceeded five hundred acres; indeed, that he positively knew it could not be short
of twelve "hundfed acres. He stated, however, to Stanwood,
that it did not exceed five hundied; to Louisa Stanwood the
same. When he went to Fairfield to buy the land, he said, in
reply to Edward Putnam's inquiry as to the number of acres,

that he did not know any thing about the amount of the land,
that he did not know the number of acres, and said there were
four or five hundred acres. Soule, another witness, represents,
that when questioned concerning the quantity, he answered that
he did not know, that there was probably two or three hundred
acres, and that the value was merely norminal. Phebe Hendrick says that Black said, that the number of acres might be
two hundred and fifty, but could not exceed three hundred acres.
Mrs. Soule says the same. These statements are so inconsistent kWith the narrative given by Black in his answer of his and
his father's agency for many years, for. Tilden, who was the
owner of a part of the Parsons grant, for which, as the agent of
Tilden they had paid the taxes for more than -twenty-seven
years, that it mustbe concluded he concealed and misrepresented
the quantity to the complaigants to induce them to sell. He
states that he had learned, as early as February, 1846, that Tilden's interest in the land did not exceed seven hundred and
seven acres. That Tilden afterwards told him, that Parsons
had conveyed to Putnam a part of the lot, but denies that he
had, prior to November, 1846, when he went to have the deed
of the complainants to him recorded, any knowledge that Aaron
Putnam was the owner of one thousand two hundred acres of
the Parsons lot or grant. Now this last may very well be so;
but whe: her he had that knowledge or not, he must have misrepre.
sented as to the quantity of the land, when he so repeatedly
undertook to speak of it as not being more than from three to
five hundred acres. It is not the less a misrepresentation because
he did not know how much Parsons had conveyed to Putnam.
1Ve undertook to speak of it as if he did, as an inducement to the
complainant to sell to him, and in that way misled him to do so.
The defendant's answer in respect to the avermefnt in the bill
of his statement to them of the payment cf taxes upon this land
is evasive, and directly at variance with the proofs in the cause.
He stbttes that his father had been the agent for the owners of
land in the township for more than thirty years, and that he had'
been his associate in such agencies since the year 1833, that it
was a part of their agency to pay the taxes assessed on the land
under their care- that the taxes on this township have, during
all the time of their agency for Tilden, been paid by his father
and himself as though the whole of said ldttery lot had been the
property of Tilden, and that he did not know until recently that
Tilden did n6t own the whole of it. And in what le means to
be a direct -denial of the plaintiffs' bill in this particular, he denies that he ever claimed any title to the land by virtue of a taxsale and deed therefor, or that he had any lien on the same for
taxes paid by himself, but that he told them that he might have

allowed the land to be sold for taxes, and that wd, meaning his
father and himself, had paid the taxes and ought to be reimbursed in the sums so paid, with such interest as the law allowed
in cases where land was sold for taxes, which he believed to be
twenty-five per cent., and that Tyler replied' that was right, and
that whoever owned the land ought to pay them.
The proofs in the cause of the use which he made of thig payment of taxes is, that he represented to the complainant when
bargaining for the land that he had a claim upon the land for
the taxes he had paid for twenty-eight or twenty-nine yeyrs;
that Tyler must pay him the amount of the taxes and twentyfive per cent. interest before he could avail himself of any title
to the land, and this he required in addition to the fifty dollars
which he asked, for the information he had concerning the land,
for which he would tell them all he knew about the land. This
is a part of Stanwood's evidence. Louisa Stanwood testifies,
that the defendant said, that Tyler would have to pay the taxes
at any rate before he could do any thing with the land, and he
could go home and have the land sold for taxes and get a good
title, and Tyler would never be-the wiser for it. To Putnam he
said the taxes h -had paid on the land wete two hundred dollars
or over; that he claimed a lien upon the land on account of it.
Albert G. Soule says, that Black stated, having ascertained that
Edward F. Putnam and his wife were heirs to a quantity of
land in Maine, which came by their grandfather Dr. Putnam,
that he had come to get a conveyance of it; "that he had paid
the taxes on the land for twenty-seven years, and he wanted
either that they should convey to him their interest or refund the
amount which he had paid for taxes. Being asked what the
amount was, he replied he did not know, but thought two hundred dollars. He was asked for his account; he answered he had
it not with him. Another witness, Phebe Hendrick, says, that
Black said he had paid the taxes for a long time, amounting to
irs. Soule repeats the same.
about two hundred dollars.
We have then, from these witnesses, a confirmation of what
was said by Black to these complainants when he was bargaining with them for their share of this land. His object evidently
was to irduce them to take his small offer for the land in consideratidn of their obligation to repay him taxes, which there is
no proof in the cause he ever paid.
In the two particulars stated, we think the entire proceedings
of Black in this transaction were inconsistent with fair dealing,
and that what was said by him both as respects the quantity of
the land and the taxes he had paid upon it amount to a fraudulent misrepresentation, entitling the complainant to the relief of
having the deed of conveyance to Black cancelled. We shall
direct it to be done.

The Secretary of the Treasury, through the Land-Office, directed the Registers to
make selections an return lists thereof, to be submitted to him for his approbation.
Under this direction, the land in question was selected anti reserved from sale.
Afterwards, the Register withdrew'the selection, by auLthority of the Commissioner
of the Land-Office, and permitted a person to enter and take it up, this person
knowing the circumstances under which it had been reserved from sale.
Finally, the Secretary of the Treasury selected the land in question, under the authority given to l1im by the act of 1826.
This selection was good, and conferred a title, overrnlihg the intermediate entry.
