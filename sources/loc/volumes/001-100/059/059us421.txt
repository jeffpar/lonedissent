DECEMBER

TERM, 1855.

421

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.
THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA v. THE WHEELING AND BELMONT
BRIDGE COMPANY ET AL.
The power of congress to regulate commerce, includes the regulation of intercourse
and navigation, and consequently the power to determine what shall or shall not
be deemed, in judgment of law, an obstruction of navigation.
The provisions of the act of congress passed August 31, 1852, (10 Stats. at Large,
112,) in its 6th and 7th sections declaring the bridges over the Ohio River at W.heeling and Bridgeport to be lawful structures at their then height and position, and
requiring the officers and crews of vessels navigating the Ohio River to regulate
their vessels so as not to interfere with the elevation and construction of said bridges,
are within the legitimate exercise, by congress, of its constitutional power to regulate commerce.
The said sections of the aforesaid act of congress are not invalid by reason of the
compact, in respect to the free navigation of the Ohio River, made between the
States of Virginia and Kentucky, with the sanction of congress at the time the latter
State was admitted into the Union.
Neither are they in conflict with the provision of the constitution of the United States
providing that "no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or
revenue to the ports of one State over those of another."
As a general proposition it is true, that an act of congress cannot annul a judgment
of the supreme court of the United States, or impair the rights determined thereby,
especially as respects adjudications upon the private rights of parties; and hence
the decree of this court heretofore rendered in this case, so far as it respects the costs
adjudged to the complainant, is unaffected by the act of congress referred to.
Bat that portion of the decree of this court at the May term, 1852, in the case of the
State of Pennsylvania v.The Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company, which relates to the abatement of the bridge, proceeded upon the ground that the bridge
was in conflict with the then existing regulations of commerce by congress, and was
executory, depending upon the bridge continuing to be an unlawful obstruction to
the public right of free navigation; and that right having since been modified by
congress in the exercise of its constitutional power to regulate commerce so that
the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction, the decree cannot now be enforced.
After the passage of the act of congress referred to, the bridge no longer being an unlawful interference with a public right, the defendaut's authority to maintain it, in
its then position and height, existed from the moment of the enactment; for their
authority then combined the concurrent powers of both governments, state and federal, and if these are not sufficient, none can be found in our system.
The complainant's motions for a writ of assistance to execute the decree of the 27th
of May, 1852, by the abatement of the bridge and for a sequestration against the
corporation and attachment against its officers for disobeying said decree are therefore refused; and the motions to punish the contempt of the corporation and its
officers in disobeying the injunction granted by Mr. Justice Grier, on the 27th of
June, 1854, are also overruled, and the injunction is dissolved.
The decree for costs being unaffected by the act of congress, the motion for taxation
and award of execution for their collection is granted.

THIS case was one of original jurisdiction in this court, upon.
the equity side; and may be said to be a continuation of the,
suit between the same parties reported in 13 How. 518.
By turning to that case, the reader will perceive that at page,
627, a day was given to the plaintiffs to move the court on the'
subject of the decree. It is now proposed to continue the narrative from that time.
The motion made by the complainant and the motion made
by the defendants to dismiss the suit, need not be particularly/
stated.

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

In the summer of 1854, the bridge was blown down by a violent storm, and the company were preparing to rebuild it according to the original plan, when the next step in the history of the
case was taken.
On the 26th day of June, 1854, in vacation of the supreme
court, the State of Pennsylvania, by her attorney-general and
her counsel, Edwin M. Stanton, pursuant to previous notice
served on the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company, appeared before the Honorable R. 0. Grier, one of the justices
of the supreme court of the United States, at chambers, and
moved for an injunction as prayed for in a supplemental bill
then exlibited. The substance and object of the bill is stated
in the subjoined order.
On hearing the bill and affidavits, the following order was
made and injunction granted.

me, R. C. Grier, one of the justices of the supreme court of the
United States, her bill of complaint in equity against the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company, setting forth, among other
things, that the said Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company
is about to erect and construct a bridge over and across the
eastern channel of the Ohio River at Wheeling, between Zane's
Island. and the main Virginia shore, at a less elevation than is
prescribed by the decree of the supreme court of the United
States heretofore rendered against said company on complaint
of said State, whereby the navigation of the Ohio River by
steamboats of the largest class will be obstructed, to the injury
of the said State; and in the vacation of the supreme court the
said complainant hath applied to me for an injunction as prayed
for in said bill against' the said Wheeling and Belmont Bridge
Company, and its president, managers, officers, engineers, agents,
contractors, and servants, to enjoin them from erecting and constructing a bridge at the place aforesaid at a less elevation than

The writs of injunction being served upon the company by
leaving a copy at its office and with its president and secretary,
and also upon the managers of the company, they proceeded to
erect the bridge notwithstanding the injunction, and it was completed in November.
At December term, 1854, the complainant, by her counsel,
having given previous notice to the company, filed a motion for
a sequestration against the company, for a contempt of court
in disobeying the injunction, and a motion for an attachment

against the officers personally for their contempt in disobeying
the injunction. The motions were as follows: Notion for Sequestration.
And now, to wit, at the December term, 1854, comes the
State of Pennsylvania, by her attorney-general, and moves the
court to order and direct a writ to be issued against the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company, to sequestrate its estate, real,
personal, and mixed, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof,
its privileges and franchises, goods, chattels, rights, credits,
moneys, and effects, for a contempt of court, by breach of and
disobedience to the lawful writ, process, orders, decree, and commands of the supreme court of the United States.
The breaches and disobedience to said writ, process, orders,
decree, and commands aforesaid are stated and charged specifically as follows: 1. That after service upon the Wheeling and Belmont
Bridge Company, by the marshal of the District of Columbia,
of a copy of a writ of injunction issued out of said court, pursuant to an order of allowance made on the 26th day of June,
1854, by the Honorable R. C. Grier, one of the judges of the
said supreme court, the said company have disobeyed said writ

and have caused and procured acts to be done, in disobedience
of said injunction and of the process and authority of said
court.
2. That after service upon said company by the marshal
aforesaid, of a copy of the decree entered by said supreme court"
at the adjourned term of May, 1852, in the case of The State of
Pennsylvania v. The Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company

and across the eastern channel of the Ohio River, between Zane's
Island and the main Virginia shore, at Wheeling, in disobedience of said injunction; and have erected and constructed, and
are engaged in erecting and constructing, and in causing and
procuring to be erected and constructed, a bridge over and across
the said channel, at a less elevation than is prescribed by the

timbers, and planks suspended in, over, and across the said channel, at a less elevation than is prescribed by the decree aforesaid.
4. That since the service of said writ and decree as aforesaid, the said company have obstructed the free navigation of
the said channel of the Ohio River, and have caused and procured the same to be obstructed, and are now keeping the same
obstructed, in breach and disobedience of said writ of injunction and decree.
F. W. HUGHES,
Attorney- General of Pennsylvania.
Motion for Attachment.
And now, to wit, at the December term, 1854, comes the State
of Pennsylvania, by her attorney-general, and moves the court
for an order that Charles Ellet, Jr., James Baker, and E.H. Fitzhugh stand committed to the jail of the District of Columbia,
for a contempt of court, by breach of and disobedience to the
lawful writ, process, order, decree, and commands of the supreme
court of the United States.
[The breaches set out were the same as above.]
A motion for a writ of assistance to execute the decree of this
court made in May, 1852, was also filed, praying the court to
order and direct such a writ to the marshal of the District of
Columbia.
A motion was also made for an award of execution for the
costs decreed in May, 1852.
The defendants appeared by their counsel, and resisted the
foregoing motions under the 6th and 7th sections of the act of
congress, (10 Stat. at Large, 112,) entitled
"An act making appropriations for the service of The PostOffice Department during the fiscal year ending the thirtieth
of June, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, and for
other purposes.
SEC. 6. And be it further enacted that the bridges across
the Ohio River at Wheeling, in the State of Virginia, and at
Bridgeport, in the State' of Ohio, abutting on Zane's Island, in
said river, are hereby declared to be lawful structures, in their
present position and elevation, and shall be so held and taken to
be, anything in any law or laws of the United States to the
contrary notwithstanding.
SEC. 7. And be it further enacted, that the said bridges are
declared to be and are established post-roads for the passage of
the mails of the United States, and that the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company are authorized to have and maintain their
said bridges at their present site and elevation, and the officers

and crews of all vessels and boats navigating said river are required to regulate the use of their said vessels and boats, and of
any pipes or chimneys belonging thereto, so as not to interfere
with the elevation and construction of said bridges.
The defendants also moved to dissolve the injunction granted
by Mr. Justice Grier.
At December term, 1854, these several motions came on to be
heard, and were argued by fr. Edwin H. Stanton, for the State
of Pennsylvania and by Hr. Tohnson and Mr. Charles31 Russell,
for the defendants.
Mr. Stanton, for the complainant, made the following points,
viz. :1. That at the date of the passage of the act of congress legalizing the Wheeling Bridge, the State of Pennsylvania had by
the judgment of the supreme court of the United States, "a just
and legal right to have the navigation of the Ohio River made
free by the removal of the bridge, or by its alteration," in conformity with the decree entered in May, 1852.
2. That this right is not taken away by congress declaring the
bridge to be a "lawful structure," because congress has no judicial authority to review or reverse the judgment of the supreme
court, and such declaration is not within the scope of the legislative authority of congress.
3. It is not taken away by the bridge being "established as a
post-road," because under the power to establish post-roads, congress has no authority to construct or maintain a road within a
State to the injury of private property or individual right.
4. It is not taken away by the requirements of the act imposing on vessels the duty " not to interfere with the construction
and elevation of the bridge," because those requirements are imposed for an object not intrusted to the general government, nor
in execution of its commercial power; and they operate to tax
the exports of a State, and give a preference by a regulation of
commerce to the ports of one State, over the ports of another.
5. It could not be taken away by any power of congress without just compensation, and none is rendered.
6. It was the duty of the defendants to obey the command of
the court, by removing or altering their bridge as rcquired by the
decree; and for their disobedience, they are in contempt, and
they are in further contempt by rebuilding the bridge in defiance
of the decree, and of the injunction issued on the 27th of June,
1854, and should be dealt with accordingly by sequestration and
attachment.
7. The decree of the court remains now in force, and the complainant is entitled to have it executed by writ of assistance and

SUPREME COURT.
State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

to have process to compel the payment of the costs awarded
by the decree.
The counsel for the defendants made the following points, viz.:
I. On the motion to dissolve the injunction.
1. The injunction was awarded without "reasonable notice
of the time and place" of the application. Act of March 2,
1793, § 5.
2. It was awarded by a judge of a different circuit from that
in which it was to operate. Laws U. S. Courts, p. 34, note.
3. It was awarded without requiring bond and security to indemnify the defendant.
4. It was awarded on a bill filed either to carry on the proceedings in a pending suit, or to carry into effect a decree made
in a former suit; and this bill does not lie, nor is it in proper form
for either purpose. Story's Eq. Plead. § 852, 429; Adams v.
Dowdings, 2 Madd, 53.
5. Congress has legalized the Wheeling Bridge; act of An
gust 31, 1852; and had constitutional power to legalize it. See
the opinions formerly delivered in the Wheeling Bridge case.
The act may be sustained under the power to regulate commerce; Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; United States v. Coombs,
12 Pet. 72, (op. 78;) or under the power to establish postroads; or under both .pqwers. And this, notwithstanding the
compact between Virginia and Kentucky; Pollard's Lessee v.
Hagam, 3 How. 212, (op. 229, 230;) The Society for propagating the Gospel v. Wheeler, 2 Gallis, C. C. R. 138; Evans v.
Easton, 1 Pet. C. C. R. 322. But that compact does not
apply.
6. A motion was offered to make absolute the decree in said
bill mentioned, and was dismissed by this court for want of prosecution on the 15th day of December, 1853.
II. Against the motion for the writ of assistance.
The same authorities as above and hereafter cited.
III. Against motions for attachment and sequestration.
1. The evidence offered does not show that the parties have
been guilty of contempt.
2. The injunction was, and is a nullity, because awarded with-

out notice, without requiring bond, and by a judge having no
jurisdiction.
3. The injunction was not regularly issued, or served by proper
officers.
4. The injunction did not point out the duties it required of
the defendants with adequate certainty. In effect it commanded
the defendants to observe the requirements of a decree which
"required" nothing such as the order of injunction vaguely

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

429

seemed to assume that it did acquire. That decree was on its
face interlocutory and left open the questions which the injunction may assume to have been decided. Birchett v. Bollings, 5
Munf. 442.
5. The court has no power to inflict summary punishment for
disobedience to any mere order of a judge at chambers. Such
disobedience can only be punished, if at all, by indictment. Act
of 1831, c. 99, 4 Stats. at Large, 487.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The motion in this case is founded upon a bill filed to carry
into execution a decree of the court, rendered against the defendants at the adjourned term in May, 1852, which decree declared the bridge erected by them across the Ohio River, between
Wheeling and Zane's Island, to be an obstruction of the free
navigation of the said river, and thereby occasioned a special
damage to the plaintiff, for which there was not an adequate
remedy at law, and directed that the obstruction be removed,
either by elevating the bridge to a height designated, or by
abatement.
Since the rendition of this decree, aud on the 31st August,
1852, an act of congress has been passed as follows: "That the
bridges across the Ohio River at Wheeling, in the State of Virginia, and at Bridgeport, in the State of Ohio, abutting on
Zane's Island, in said river, are hereby declared to be lawful
structures in their present positions and elevations, and shall be
so held and taken to be, anything in the law or laws of the
United States to the contrary notwithstanding."
And further: "That the said bridges be declared to be and are
established post-roads for the passage of the mails of the United
States, and that the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company
are authorized to have and maintain their bridges at their present
site and elevation; and the officers and crews of all vessels and
boats navigating said river are required to regulate the use of
their said vessels, and of any pipes or chimneys belonging thereto,
so as not to interfere with the elevation and construction of said
bridges."
The defendants rely upon this act of congress as furnishing
authority for the continuance of the bridge as constructed, and
as superseding the effect and operation of the decree of the court
previously rendered, declaring it an obstruction to the navigation.
On the part of the plaintiff, it is insisted that the act is unconstitutional and void, which raises the principal question in the
case.

In order to a proper understanding of this question it is ma-

430

SUPREM1E COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

terial to recur to the ground and principles upon which the majority of the court proceeded in rendering the decree now sought
to be enforced.
The bridge had been constructed under an act of the legislature of the State of Virginia; and it was admitted that act
conferred full authority upon the defendants for the erection,
subject only to the power of congress in the regulation of commerce. It was claimed, however, that congress had acted upon
the subject and had regulated the navigation of the Ohio River,
and had thereby secured to the public, by virtue of its authority,
the free and unobstructed use of the same; and that the erection of the bridge, so far as it interfered with the enjoyment of
this use, was inconsistent with and in violation of the acts of
congress, and destructive of the right derived under them; and
that, to the extent of this interference with the free navigation
of the river, the act of the legislature of Virginia afforded no
authority or justification. It was in conflict with the acts of
congress, which were the paramount law.
This being the view of the case taken by a majority of the
court, they found no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion, that
the obstruction of the navigation of the river, by the bridge, was
a violation of the right secured to the public by the constitution
and laws of congress, nor in applying the appropriate remedy in
behalf of the plaintiff. The ground and principles upon which
the court proceeded will be found reported in 13 How. 518.
Since, however, the rendition of this decree, the acts of congress, already referred to, have been passed, by which the bridge
is made a post-road for the passage of the mails of the United
States, and the defendants are authorized to have and maintain
it at its present site and elevation, and requiring all persons
navigating the river to regulate such navigation so as not to interfere with it.
So far, therefore, as this bridge created an obstruction to the
free navigation of the river, in view of the previous acts of congress, they are to be regarded as modified by this subsequent
legislation; and, although it still may be an obstruction in fact,
is not so in the contemplation of law. We have already said,
and the principle is undoubted, that the act of the legislature of
Virginia conferred full authority to erect and maintain the bridge,
subject to the exercise of the power of congress to regulate the
navigation of the river.. That body having in the exercise of this
power, regulated the navigation consistent with its preservation
and continuation, the authority to maintain it would seem to be
complete. That authority combines the concurrent powers of
both governments, state and federal, which, if not sufficient,
certainly none can be found in our system of government.

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

431

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

We do not enter upon the question, whether or not congress
possess the power, under the authority in the constitution, "to
establish post-offices and post-roads," to legalize this bridge; for,
conceding that no such powers can be derived from this clause,
it must be admitted that it is, at least, necessarily included in the
power conferred to regulate commerce among the several States.
The regulation of commerce includes intercourse and navigation, and, of course, the power to determine what shall or shall
not be deemed in judgment of law an obstruction to navigation;
and that power, as we have seen, has been exercised consistent
with the continuance of the bridge.
But it is urged, that the act of congress cannot have the effect
and operation to annul the judgment of the court already rendered, or the rights determined thereby in favor of the plaintiff.
This, as a general proposition, is certainly not to be denied,
especially as it respects adjudication upon the private rights of
parties. When they have passed into judgment the right becomes absolute, and it is the duty of the court to enforce it..
The case before us, however, is distinguishable from this class
of cases, so far as it respects that portion of the decree directing
the abatement of the bridge. Its interference with the free
navigation of the river constituted an obstruction of a public
right secured by acts of congress.
But, although this right of navigation be a public right common to all, yet, a private party sustaining special damage by
the obstruction may, as has been held in this case, maintain an
action at law against the party creating it, to recover his damages; or, to prevent irreparable injury, file a bill in chancery for
the purpose of removing the obstruction. In both cases, the
private right to damages, or to the removal, arises out of the
unlawful interference with the enjoyment of the public right,
which, as we have seen, is under the regulation of congress.
Now, we agree, if the remedy in this case had been an action
at law, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for
damages, the right to these would have passed beyond the reach
of the power of congress. It would have depended, not upon
the public right of the free navigation of the river, but upon the
judgment of the court. The decree before us, so far as it
respect the costs adjudged, stands upon the same principles,
and is unaffected by the subsequent law. But that part of the
decree, directing the abatement of the obstruction, is executory,
a continuing decree, which requires not only the removal of the
bridge, but enjoins the defendants against any reconstruction
or continuance. Now, whether it is a future existing or continuiing obstruction depends upon the question whether or not it
interferes with the right of navigation. If, in the mean time,

432

SUPREME

COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

since the decree, this right has been modified by the competent
authority, so that the bridge is no longer an unlawful obstruction,
it is quite plain the decree of the court cannot be enforced.
There is no longer any interference with the enjoyment of the
public right inconsistent with law, no more than there would be
where the plaintiff himself had consented to it, after the rendition of the decree. Suppose the decree had been executed, and
after that the passage of the law in question, can it be doubted
but that the defendants would have had a right to reconstruct
it? And is it not equally clear that the right to maintain it, if
not abated, existed from the moment of the enactment?
A class of cases that have frequently occurred in the state
courts contain principles analogous to those involved in the present case. The purely internal streams of a State which are
navigable belong to the riparian owners to the thread of the
stream, and, as such, they have a right to use the waters and
bed beneath, for their own private emolument, subject only to
the public right of navigation. They may construct wharves or
dams or canals for the purpose of subjecting the stream to the
various uses to which it may be applied, subject to this public
easement. But, if these structures materially interfere with the
public right, the obstruction may be removed or abated as a
public nuisance.
In respect to these purely internal streams of a State, the
public right of navigation is exclusively under the control and
regulation of the state legislature; and in cases where these
erections or obstructions to the navigation are constructed under
a law of the State, or sanctioned by legislative authority, they
are neither a public nuisance subject to abatement, nor is the
individual who may have sustained special damage from their
interference with the public use entitled to any remedy for his
loss. So far as the public use of the stream is concerned, the
legislature having the power to control and regulate it, the statute
authorizing the structure, though it may be a real impediment
to the navigation, makes it layful. 5 Wend. 448, 449; 15 Ib.
113; 17 T. R. 195 ; 20 Ib.90, 101; 5 Cow. 165.
It is also urged that this act of congress is void, for the reason that it is inconsistent with the compact between the States
of Virginia and Kentucky, at the time of the admission of the
latter into the Union, by which it was agreed, "that the use and
navigation of the river Ohio, so far as the territory of the proposed, or the territory that shall remain within the limits of this
commonwealth, lies thereon, shall be free and common to the
citizens of the United States," and which compact was assented
to by congress at the time of the admission of the State.
This court held, in the case of Green et al. v. Biddle, 2 Wheat.

the compact was null and void, within the provision of the constitution forbidding a State to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. But that is not the question here. The
question here is, whether or not the compact can operate as a
restriction upon the power of congress under the constitution to
regulate commerce among the several States ? Clearly not.
Otherwise congress and two States would possess the power to
modify and alter the constitution itself.
This is so plain that it is unnecessary to pursue the argument
further. But we may refer to the case of Wilson v. Mason,
1 Cranch, 88, 92, where it was held that this compact, which
stipulated that rights acquired under the commonwealth of Virginia shall be decided according to the then existing laws, could
not deprive congress of the power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of this court, and prevent a review where none was given
in the state law existing at the time of the compact. Again, it
is insisted that the act of congress is void, as being inconsistent
with the clause in the ninth section of article first of the constitution, which declares that "no preference shall be given by any
regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over
those of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from one State
be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another."
It is urged that the interruption of the navigation of the steamboats engaged in commerce and conveyance of passengers upon
the Ohio River at Wheeling from the erection of the bridge, and
the delay and expense arising therefrom, virtually operate to give
a preference to this port over that of Pittsburg; that the vessels
to and from Pittsburg navigating the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers are not only subjected to this delay and expense in the
course of the voyage, but that the obstruction will necessarily
have the effect to stop the trade and business at Wheeling, or
divert the same in some other direction or channel of commerce.
Conceding all this to be true, a majority of the court are of opinion that the act of congress is not inconsistent with the clause
of the constitution referred to -in other words, that is not giving
a preference to the ports of one State over those of another,
within the true meaning of that provisiofi. There are many acts
of congress passed in the exercise of this power to regulate commerce, providing for a special advantage to the port or ports
of one State, and which very advantage may incidentally operate to the prejudice of the ports in a neighboring State, which
have never been supposed to conflict with this limitation upon
its power. The improvement of rivers and harbors, the erection
of light-houses, and other facilities of commerce, may be referred
to as examples. It will not do to say that the exercise of an

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

admitted power of congress conferred by the constitution is to
be withheld, if it appears, or can be shown, that the effect and
operation of the law may incidentally extend beyond the limitation of the power. Upon any such interpretation, the principal
object of the framers of the instrument in conferring the power
would be sacrificed to the subordinate consequences resulting
from its exercise. These consequences and incidents are very
proper considerations to be urged upon congress for the purpose
of dissuading that body from its exercise, but afford no ground
for denying tile power itself, or the right to exercise it.
The court are also of opinion that, according to the true exposition of this prohibition upon the power of congress, the law
in question cannot be regarded as in conflict with it.
The propositions originally introduced into the convention,
from which this clause in the constitution was derived, declared
that congress shall not have power to compel vessels belonging to citizens or foreigners to enter or pay duties or imposts in
any other State than that to which they were bound, nor to clear
from any other than that in which their cargoes were laden.
Nor shiall any privilege or immunity be granted to any vessels
on entering or clearing out, or paying duties or imposts, in one
State in preference to another. Also, that congress shall not have
power to fix or establish the particular ports for collecting the
duties or imposts in any State, unless the State should neglect
to fix them upon notice. I give. merely the substance of the
several propositions.
Luther Martin, in his letter to the legislature of Maryland,
says that these propositions were introduced into the convention
by the Maryland delegation; and that without them, he observes,
it would have been in the power of congress to compel ships
sailing in or out of the Chesapeake to clear or enter at Norfolk,
or some port in Virginia - a regulation that would be injurious
to the commerce of Maryland. It appears also, from the reports
of the convention, that several of the delegates from that State
expressed apprehensions that under the power to regulate commerce congress might favor ports of particular States, by requiring vessels destined to other States to enter and clear at the
ports of the favored ones, as a vessel bound for Baltimore to
enter and clear at Norfolk
These several propositions finally took the form of the clause in
question, namely: No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those
of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from one State be
obliged to enter or clear or pay duties in another." 1 Elliot's
Deb. 266, 270, 279, 280, 811, 375; 5 1b. 478, 483, 502, 545.

the States was given up, and left to congress. But the rights
of the States were secured, by the exemption of vessels from the
necessity of entering or paying duties in the ports of any State
other than that to which they were bound, or to obtain a clearance from any port other than at the home port, or that from
which they sailed. And, also, by the provision that no preference should be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue,
to the ports of one State over those of another. So far as the
regulation of revenue is concerned, the prohibition in the clause
does not seem to have been very important, as, in a previous
section, (8,) it was declared, that "all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States"; and, as
to a preference by a regulation of commerce, the history of the
provision, as well as its language, looks to a prohibition against
granting privileges or immunities to vessels entering or clearing
from the ports of one State over those of another. That these
privileges and immunities, whatever they may be in the judgment of congress, shall be common and equal in all the ports of
the several States. Thus much is undoubtedly embraced in the
prohibition; and it may, certainly, also embrace any other description of legislation looking to a direct privilege or preference
of the ports of any particular State over those of another. Indeed, the clause, in terms, seems to import a prohibition against
some positive legislation by congress to this effect, and not
against any incidental advantages that might possibly result
from the legislation of congress upon other subjects connected
with commerce, and confessedly within its power.
Besides, it is a mistake to assume that congress is forbidden
to give a preference to a port in one State over a port in another.
Such preference is given inevery instance where it makes a port
in one State a port of entry, and refuses to make another port
in another State a port of entry. No greater preference, in one
sense, can be more directly given than in this way; and yet, the
power of congress to give such preference has never been questioned. Nor can it be without asserting that the moment congress makes a port in one State a port of entry, it is bound, at
the same time, to make all other ports in all other States ports
of entry. The truth seems to be, that what is forbidden is, not
discrimination between individual ports within the same or different States, but discrimination between States; and if so, in order
to bring this case within the prohibition, it is necessary to show,
not merely discrimination between Pittsburg and Wheeling, but
discrimination between the ports of Virginia and those of Pennsylvania.
Upon the whole, without pursuing the examination further,
our conclusion is, that, so far as respects that portion of the decree which directs the alteration or abatement of the bridge, it

436

COURT.

cannot be carried into execution since the act of congress which
regulates the navigation of the Ohio River, consistent with the
existence and continuance of the bridge; and that this part of
the motion, in behalf of the plaintiff, must be denied. But
that, so far as respects that portion of the decree which directs
the costs to be paid by the defendants, the motion must be
granted.
A motion has also been made, on behalf of the plaintiff, for
attachments against the president of the Bridge Company and
others, for disobedience of an injunction issued by Mr. Justice
Grier, in vacation, on the 27th June, 1854.
It appears that since the rendition of the decree of this court
and the passage of the act of congress, and before any proceedings taken to enforce the execution of the decree, notwithstanding this act, the bridge was broken down, in a gale of wind,
leaving only some of the cables suspended from the towers
across the river. Upon the happening of this event, a bill was
filed by the plaintiff, and an application for the injunction above
mentioned was made, which was granted, enjoining the defendants, their officers and agents, against a reconstruction of the
bridge, unless in conformity with the requirements of the previous decree in the case. The object of the injunction was to
suspend the work, together with the great expenses attending it,
until the determination of the question by this court as to the
force and effect of the act of congress, in respect to the execution of the decree. The defendants did not appear upon the
notice given of the motion for the injunction, and it was, consequently, granted without opposition.
After the writ was served, it was disobeyed, the defendants
proceeding in the reconstruction of the bridge, which they had
already begun before the issuing or service of the process.
A motion is now made for attachments against the persons
mentioned for this disobedience and contempt.
A majority of the court are of opinion, inasmuch as we have
arrived at the conclusion that the act of congress afforded full
authority to the defendants to reconstruct the bridge, and the
decree directing its alteration or abatement could not, therefore,
be carried into execution after the enactment of this law, and
inasmuch as the granting of an attachment for the disobedience
is a question resting in the discretion of the court, that, under
all the circumstances of the case, the motion should be denied.
Some of the judges also entertain doubts as to the regularity
of the proceedings in pursuance of which the injunction was
issued.
Mr. Justice WAYNE, Mr. Justice GRIER, and Mr. Justice
CURTIS are of opinion that, upon the case presented, the attachment for contempt should issue, and in which opinion T concur.

The motion for the attachment is denied, and the injunction

Mr. Justice McLEAN, dissenting.
A motion was made, at the last term, for process of contempt against the bridge company, for not complying with
the decree of this court to elevate or abate the suspension bridge,
or open a draw in the bridge over the western branch of the
Ohio; so as to afford a safe channel for steamboats when the
water is too high for them to pass under the suspension bridge;
and also for not obeying the injunction granted, &c.
In opposition to this motion the act of congress of the 81st of
August, 1852, is set up, -khich purports to legalize both"bridges.
The 6th section of the above act provides "that the bridges
across the Ohio River at Wheeling, in the State of Virginia, and
at Bridgeport, in the State of Ohio, abutting on Zane's Island,
in said river, are her.eby declared to be lawful structures in their
present position and elevation, and shall be so held and taken
to be, anything in any law or laws of the United States to the
contrary notwithstanding."
7th section. "And be it further enacted, that the said bridges
are declared to be and are established post-roads for the passage
of the mails of the United States, and that the Wheeling and
Belmont Bridge Company are authorized to have and maintain
their said bridges at their present site and elevation; and the
officers and crews of all vessels and boats navigating said river
are required to regulate the use of their said vessels and boats,
and of any pipes or chimneys belonging thereto, so as not to
interfere with the elevation and construction of said bridges."
This court, in the exercise of its judicial functions, with the
approbation of seven of its members, which included all the
judges present, with but one exception, took jurisdiction of a
complaint made by the State of Pennsylvania against the Wheeling Bridge Company, which was charged with having constructed
its bridge so low as to cause a material obstruction to the commerce of the Ohio River; and which was especially injurious to
the State of Pennsylvania, which had expended several millions
of dollars in the construction of lines of improvement from
Philadelphia to Pittsburg-such as turnpike roads, railroads,
canals, and slackwater navigation -over which more than fifty
millions' worth of property were transported annually, in connection with the Ohio River ; and that any material obstruction
to the navigation of the river by the bridge would be injurious
to that State, by lessening the transportation of passengers and
freight on the above lines.
After a very tedious and minute investigation of the facts of
37*

438

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

the case, which embraced the reports of practical engineers, depositions from the most experienced river men, statements of the
stages of water in the river throughout the year, and also after a
full consideration of the legal principles applicable to the matter
in controversy, six of the members of this tribunal, two only dissenting, were brought to the conclusion that the bridge was a
material obstruction to the navigation of the river, at seasons of
the year and under circumstances which rendered its navigation
most importafit to the public and to the complainant, and that
there was no adequate remedy for it by an action at common
law.
From the facts developed in the course of the investigation, it
appeared that the seven passenger packets, which plied between
Cincinnati and Pittsburg, whose progress was obstructed by
the bridge, conveyed about one half of the goods, in value,
which were transported on the river, and three fourths of the
passengers between: the above cities. That each packet transported annually thirty thousand nine hundred and sixty tons of
freight, and twelve thousand passengers.
It appeared that a steamboat drawing five feet water, and
whose chimneys were seventy-nine feet six inches high, could
never pass under the apex of the bridge, at any stage of the
water, without lo~ering its chimneys. And the court found by
lowering the chimneys, including the expense of machinery, and
delay of time, without an estimate as to the dangers incurred
by the operation, that a tax was imposed upon the seven packets,
annually, of 8 5,598.00, which sum was exacted from the owners,
for the accommodation of the crossing public and the bridge
proprietors.
The court also found that the cost of each packet, per running
hour, was eight dollars and thirty-three cents ; and, as was estimated, if the chimney should be made shorter, so as to pass
under the bridge at an ordinary stage of water, it would cause
the average loss of four hours in each trip between Cincinnati
and Pittsburg, which would amount to the sum of thirty-three
dollars and thirty-two cents, which, being multiplied by sixty,
the average number of trips each season, would amount to the
sum of $1,999.20; and this, being multiplied by seven, would
make the sum of 818,994.40, which would bean annual loss by
the owners of these packets.
The court also found, that from the great weight of the chimneys of the packets, and other boats of that class, they could
not be lowered by hinges at the tops; that they could only be
let down at the hurricane deck by means of a derrick. The
average weight of the chimneys, which must be lowered upon
each of the large boats, was about four tons; and if this enor-

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

439

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

mous weight, hanging over the cabin, or rather over the berths
of the passengers, in tile process of lowering, should come down
by the run, their weight would crush the hurricane deck, break
through the berths of the cabin, and be arrested, probably, only
by the cargo or the lower flooring of the vessel.
For these reasons, and others contained in the opinion of the
court, they came to the decision that the bridge obstructed the
navigation of the Ohio, and to the irremediable injury at law of
the public works of Pennsylvania. But, to avoid any greater
hardship on the bridge owners than would be required by the
maintenance of the commercial right, this court decreed that if
the defendant would open a draw in the western channel which
would admit the passage of boats, when, from the high water,
they could not pass under the suspension bridge, that it would
remove all reasonable ground of complaint by the plaintiffs.
But this it refused to do, and invoked the legislation of congress
successfully, in procuring the passage of the act above cited.
That congress have a constitutional power to regulate commerce among the States, as with foreign nations, must be
admitted. And where the constitution imposes no restriction
on this power, it is exercised at discretion ; and the correction
of impolicy, or abuse, is only through the ballot-box. During
the existence of the embargo, in the year 1808, it was contended
that, under the commercial power, an embargo could not be
imposed, a. it destroyed commerce. But it was held otherwise;
so that the constitutionality of a regulation of commerce by
congress does not depend upon the policy and justice of such an
act, but generally upon its discretion.
An embargo is a temporary regulation, and is designed for
the protection of commerce, though, for a time, it may suspend
it. There are, however, limitations on the exercise of the commercial power by congress. As stated in the opinion of the
court, congress had regulated the commerce of the Ohio River.
But all such regulations, before the passage of the above act,
were of a general character, and tended to the security of transportation, whether of freight or passengers.
The decree in the Wheeling bridge case was the result of a
judicial investigation, founded upon facts ascertained in the
course of the hearing. It was strictly a judicial question. The
complaint was an obstruction of commerce, by the bridge, to
the injury of the complainant, and the court found the fact to
be as alleged in the bill. It was said by Chief Justice Mfarshall,
many years ago, that congress could do many things, but that
it could not alter a fact. This it has attempted to do in the
above act. An obstruction to the navigation of the river was,
technically, a nuisance, and, in their decree, this court so pronounced.

440

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

The compact between Virginia and Kentucky, which "declared, that the use and navigation of the river Ohio should be
free and common to the citizens of the United States," was
incorporated into the Kentucky constitution of 1791, and received
the sanction of congress in the admission of that State into the
Union. This compact bound both parties; and this court held,
that a violation of it by a law of Kentucky, called the occupying
claimant law, was void, as it impaired the obligation of the compact. Virginia, no more than Kentucky, could violate any of
its provisions, although they extended to citizens of the Union.
The effect that the act of congress shall have upon the decree
of the court, I will now consider. This subject can be treated
only with the profoundest respect for the legislative action of
the nation, and with a sincere desire to give to it all the effect
which such an expression should have.
The congress and the court constitute co-ordinate branches of
the government; their duties are distinct and of a different
character. The judicial power cannot legislate, nor can the
legislative power act judicially. The constitution has declared,
that the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and
equity arising under the constitution, the laws of the United
States, and treaties, &c. All legislative powers are vested in
congress. While these functionaries are limited to their appropriate duties as vested, there can be little or no conflict of jurisdiction.
From the organization of the legislative power, it is unfitted
for the discharge of judicial duties; and the same may be said
of this court in regard to legislation. It may therefore happen,
that, when either trenches upon the appropriate powers of the
other, their acts are inoperative and void.
The judicial power is exercised in the decision of cases; the
legislative, in making general regulations by the enactment of
laws. The latter acts from considerations of public policy; the
former by the pleadings and evidence in a case. From this
view it is at once seen, that congress could not undertake to
hear the complaint of Pennsylvania in this case, take testimony
or cause it to be taken, examine the surveys and reports of engineers, decide the questions of law which arise on the admission of
the testimony, and give the proper and legal effect to the evidence
in the final decree. To do this is the appropriate duty of the
judicial power. And this is what was done by this court, before
the above act of congress was passed. The court held, that the
bridge obstructed the navigation of the Ohio River, and that,
consequently, it was a nuisance. The act declared the bridge
to be a legal structure, and, consequently, that it Nvas not a
nuisance. Now, is this a legislative or a judicial act ? Whether

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

-441

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

it be a nuisance or not, depends upon the fact of obstruction;
and this would seem to be strictly a judicial question, to be
decided on evidence produced by the parties ina case.
We do not speak of a public commercial right, but of an
obstruction to it, by which an individual wrong is done, that at
law is irremediable. A regulation of the public right belongs
exclusively to congress. It is a question of policy, which seldom,
if ever, comes within the range of judicial action. All such
questions belong to the legislative power.
The words of the seventh section of the act are, "that the
said bridges are declared to be and are established post-roads
for the passage of the mails of the United States; and that the
Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company are authorized to
have and maintain their said bridges, at their present site and
elevation; and the officers and crews of all vessels and boats
navigating the river are required to regulate the use of their
said vessels and boats, and of any pipes or chimneys belonging
thereto, so as not to interfere with the elevation and construction of said bridges."
The provisions of this section are: 1. The bridges are declared to be post-roads; and, 2. The pipes and chimneys of the
boats ara required to be cut down, so as not to interfere with
said bridges.
And, first, as to the effect of making the bridges post-roads :
By the act of the 7th July, 1838, all railroads are declared to
be post-roads; and, for more than twenty years, all navigable
waters on which steamboats regularly ply are established as
post-roads.
The policy of extending the lines of post-roads on all railroads and navigable waters was to require, under a penalty, all
boats and railroad cars to deposit in post-offices all letters which
they may carry, so that the postage may be charged. It gives to
the government no rights on these lines of communication,
except where the mail may be carried under a contract, which,
if obstructed, subjects the offender to prosecution. It gives to
the government no other interest in or control over the road.
The railroad may be changed at the will of the proprietors,
and the mail will not be carried in the cars, except by contract,
for which a compensation is paid. The same principle applies
to a turnpike road on which the mail is carried. Even an ordinary road, though a post-road, may be altered or vacated at the
will of the local authority.
It is difficult to perceive what benefit can result to the public
from these bridges being declared a post-road. It cannot use
the bridges without paying toll the same as for the use of a
turnpike road or railroad. It does not prevent the Bridge Coin-

442

SUPREME

COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

pany from pulling down the bridge or altering it in any respect.
They are under no obligation by reason of this use to keep up
the bridge or repair it. They may abandon it, and if it should
be again prostrated- by the winds, they are not obliged to rebuild it.
The idea that making the bridge a post-road would exempt
it from the consequence of being a nuisance, is wholly unsustainable. Should the contractor to carry the mail refuse or
neglect to pay the customary tolls, he would be liable to a suit
for the amount. If one of the Pittsburg packets carry the mail
under a contract with the post-office department, and the bridge
should obstruct the boat, such an obstruction would make the
bridge company liable, unless the above act, which gives a preference to the crossing mail, applies a different rule to the mail
boat; and it would seem that no such preference can arise
under the law declaring the bridge to be a post-road.
But is there a power in congress to legalize a bridge over a
navigable water within the jurisdiction of any State or States?
It has the power to regulate commerce among the several
States, requiring two or more States to authorize the regulation.
But this does not necessarily include the power to construct
bridges which may obstruct commerce, but can never increase
its facilities on a navigable water. Any power which congress
may have in regard to such a structure is indirect, and results
from a commercial regulation. It may, under this power, declare
that no bridge shall be built which shall be an obstruction to
the use of a navigable water. And this, it would seem, is as
far as the commercial power by congress can be exercised.
The same power that would enable congress to build a bridge
over a navigable stream would authorize it to construct a railroad or turnpike road through the States of the Union, as it
might deem expedient. This power may have been asserted in
regard to post-roads, but the settled opinion now seems to be,
that to establish post-roads within the meaning of the constitution is to designate them. In this sense congress may establish
post-roads extending over bridges, but it can neither build them
nor exercise any control over them, except the mere use for the
conveyance of the mail on paying toll.
It has often been held, that in throwing a bridge across a
navigable river or arm of a lake, or the sea, the sovereign power
of the State in some form may authorize it, under such restrictions and conditions as may be considered best for the public.
But this power must always be so exercised as not materially
to obstruct navigation. Over this public right congress exercises
exclusive legislation, except where the constitution restricts it;
and the judicial power can never interpose, except in regard to

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

443

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

private injuries.
It would be otherwise if congress should
authorize an indictment for obstructing the public right of navigation on the Ohio, or generally. If, under the commercial
power, congress may make bridges over navigable waters, it
would be difficult to find any limitation of such a power. Turnpike roads, railroads, and canals might on the same principle be
built by congress. And if this be a constitutional power, it
cannot be restricted or intert'ered with by any state regulation.
So extravagant and absorbing a federal power as this has rarely,
if ever, been claimed by any one. It would, in a great degree,
supersede the state governments by the tremendous authority
and patronage it would exercise. But if the power be found
in the constitution, no principle is perceived by which it can be
practically restricted. This dilemma leads us to the conclusion
that it is not a constitutional power.
Having arrived at this
point, it only remains to say, that the act of congress declaring
the bridge to be a legal structure, being the exercise of a judicial and an appellate power, is unconstitutional, and consequently inoperative. It is what it purports to be, a reversal of
the decree of this court, in effect, if not in terms.
Under the commercial power, congress may declare what
shall constitute al obstruction of commerce, on a navigable
water; and so far as the public .right is concerned, there is no
limitation to the exercise of this power, unless it be found in the
constitution.
It must be admitted that the provision in the 7th section in
regard to the length of the pipes and chimneys of the boats
which ply on the Ohio from and to Pittsburg is a commercial
regulation. Congress have required the boilers of steamboats to
be inspected, and that an iron chain should be used as a tillerrope on all steamboats, and this has been required with a view
to the safety of the boat, its passengers and cargo. In the event
of fire the rope is generally burnt, and the boat becomes unmanageable. This is as far as congress has legislated, in regard
to the tackle of the boat. No attempt has before been made to
regulate the height of the chimneys.
From facts above stated, it appears the speed of the seven
packets, by cutting down the chimney, would be reduced four
hours, on an average, each, on a trip between Pittsburg and
Cincinnati. This, as the statement shows, would increase the
expense of the owners of the seven packets, in addition to the
loss of time, $13,994.40 per annum. Such a regulation would
seem to be the more objectionable, as the loss arises from the
preference given to the bridge, which the public accommodation
does not require.
But there is another objection, of a more serious nature. In

444:

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

the 9th section of the 2d article of the constitution, it is declared
"that no preference shall be given, by any regulation of commerce
or revenue, to the ports of one State over those of another." This
can have no relation to "duties and imposts," as, in the 8th section, it is declared "they shall be uniform throughout the United
States." The clause must refer to some other regulation, and it
applies, of course, to all regulations affecting commerce.
It was said in the late argument of this case, that the Pittsburg packets had done a larger business in transportation the
last year, than within the same time at any former period. If
this be so, the injury by cutting down the chimneys of all the
boats to and from Pittsburg must amount to a larger sum than
above stated. Nothing could more forcibly illustrate the propriety of the above provision in the constitution, that no port in
one State shall have a preference over those of another.
Practical knowledge in regard to steamboat and railroad
transportation of freight is better than theory. Notwithstanding the lines of railroad from Pittsburg to Cincinnati, and to
St. Louis, by the way of Chicago, for the past year have been
in operation, the business on the steamboat lines has greatly
increased in freight; and from published prices it would seem
that the water transportation is three times cheaper than the
railroad, and, on account of the frequent detention of freight cars,
is much more expeditious.
But it is said many regulations of commerce, from local circumstances, cannot operate equally on all ports. As, for instance, a breakwater may be more beneficial to one port than
another; and the same inequality may exist from the establishment of light-houses and the improvement of harbors. But
these are incidental and not direct consequences, resulting from
the exercise of the legislative power, and no prudence can,
effectually, guard against them. As near as may be, equal
facilities should be given to ports of equal importance; this
however, is a matter for the decision of congress, and does not
belong to the judiciary. But where a prohibition is imposed on
congress in the exercise of the commercial power, and it is not
regarded, it is a judicial question, and this is the only check to
be relied on against such unconstitutional legislation.
It is objected that the court cannot determine what degree of
preference shall be given to one port over another, to make the
regulation come within the prohibition. If this be so, then is
the constitutional prohibition a dead letter ; but this is not the
practical view which this court have uniformly taken of the
constitution. The restrictions on state powers stand upon the
same footing, and no insuperable difficulty has been found in
giving effect to them.

431, the court say, "that the power to tax ' the Bank of the
United States' involves the power to destroy," and on this
ground the tax on the bank by the legislature of Maryland was
declared to be unconstitutional and void. If this rule be applied
to the point under consideration, no doubt could exist. Congress
are prohibited from giving a preference to one port over another
in different States, and consequently, if any such preference be
given, the regulation is void. Not an incidental preference, but
a regulation which necessarily acts injuriously and oppressively
on one to the exclusion of other ports.
Suppose congress had declared by law that all steamboats
plying to and from Pittsburg should not use chimneys more
than forty feet high, which would essentially retard their progress, and consequently injure their business, would any court
hesitate to pronounce such a regulation unconstitutional, as
giving a preference to all other ports on the river over that of
Pittsburg. This congress has in effect done, and the only justification for it must be found, if any exist, in the regulated height
of the bridge. But the bridge, at a very small expense comparatively, could have been elevated as our decree required, and
as the charter under which it was built also required. Less
than this: if a draw had been made in the bridge over the
western channel, so as to enable boats to pass up and down the
river when they could not pass under the suspension bridge,
nothing more was required. The expense of the draw, it is
believed, would not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, - a sum
less, as it would seem, than the annual injury inflicted oil the
commerce of Pittsburg by the bridge.
If the regulation of the chimneys of steamboats, as in the law
to protect the bridge, woifld be unconstitutional without the
bridge, it is not perceived how the bridge could make it consti
tutional. The right to cross the river by a bridge, and to navigate it, is admitted; but these public rights are not incompatiblo.
They can both be enjoyed without any material interference of
the one with the other. This being the case, congress, it would
seem, cannot restrict the right to navigate the river for the benefit of the bridge. It cannot violate the constitutional inhibition

in giving a preference to other.ports over that of Pittsburg, by
declaring the Wheeling bridge formed no obstruction to navigation. The constitution declares congress shall not give a pref
erence to one port over another; the act, if done, is not
constitutional, though done under the power to regulate corn
merce.
The equality which such a regulation was intended to secure
is a matter intimately connected with the commercial prosperity
of the country. For a wrong thus done by congress there is
no remedy, except through the exercise of the judicial power.
This court is sworn to support the constitutioi, and in every infraction of that instrument by congress or state legislatures,
where individual injury is inflicted, redress may be obtained by
action in court. Congress is prohibited from laying a duty on
exports, except for port charges. Can a duty be imposed on,
exports beyond this under the commercial power ? The commercial power is limited in this and in other cases, and if the
limit be exceeded the act is void. The federal government in
all its forms exercises enumerated and limited powers. But if
the limitation depends upon the discretion of congress, there is
neither limitation nor protection.. This is neither the theory nor
the practical operation of the government. Congress has power
to regulate commerce, but it has no power in such regulation
to give a preference to one port in a State over another port in
a different State. If it may do this to an extent materially injurious, it may equally disregard every other restriction in the
constitution. The regulation of the height of the chimneys of
steamboats which ply to and from Pittsburg, by the present
elevation of the bridge, is the same in effect and in principle as
if the act had required such steamers to cut down their chimneys without reference to the bridge. The bridge affords no
justification or excuse for an unconstitutional regulation.
But it is said there is great difficulty in ascertaining the fact,
that a regulation gives a preference to one or more ports in a
State over those of another, and it is intimated that a jury
should be called to ascertain the fact. This argument was used
in regard to the fact of obstruction complained of by Pennsylvania; but this court very properly determined that a court of
chancery, having jurisdiction, could inquire whether the bridge
constituted such an obstruction to commerce as materially to
injure the public works of Pennsylvan.ia, and on such a finding
by this court the late decree was entered for the removal of the
obstruction.
What fact beyond this is necessary to determine the fact of
preference of one port over another ? The chimneys of the
steamboats which ply to and from Pittsburg are required to be

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

447

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

cut down, so as to pass under the bridge. By this the rights of
the port of Pittsburg are measured by the Wheeling bridge,
and that bridge, this court have held, is so material an obstruction to commerce as to be a nuisance to the State of Pennsylvania.
This obstruction or nuisance consists in the necessity, when a
boat passes under the bridge, of lowering its chimneys or cutting
them down, so as to pass under it; and if this be a material injury to the commerce of the State of Peinsylvania, on its lines
of improvement, how much greater the injury to the port of Pittsburg, from and to which one hundred millions' worth of property
is transported annually ? Can any one fail to see that the proof
of preference to the port of Wheeling, and those below it, is given
by the regulation complained of, over the port of Pittsburg and
others above the bridge ? The proof of this important fact, as
found by the decision of the court already pronounced, is more
conclusive to show the preference than to establish the claim of
Pennsylvania.
Can it be urged that this preference is limited to a mere entry
of the port? Had the Wheeling bridge been constructed over
the Ohio River, a short distance below Pittsburg, it would have
been far less injurious to that port than it now is; the boats,
with their propelling power undiminished, could have approached near to that port, where their cargoes are discharged
and received.
It is contended that the commerce across the river required
the consideration of congress equally with that which floated
upon its surface. There is no ground for such an argument.
Some twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars, under the decree,
would open a passage in the western channel so as to remove the
obstruction. The annual injury to the commerce of the port of
Pittsburg by the bridge is believed to exceed that sum.
Had the act of congress required all steamboats which ply
upon the Ohio River to cut down their chimneys, so as to pass
under the Wheeling bridge, the regulation, being general, however injurious, would not have given a preference to one port
over another. It would have been the exercise of the commercial power, within the constitution.
The principle involved in this case is of the deepest interest
to the commerce of the West. The Mississippi River and its
tributaries water a country unsurpassed, if equalled, in the
world, in extent and fertility. But if the obstruction of the
Wheeling bridge may be repeated wherever the crossing public
shall think proper to build a bridge, one third of the internal
commerce of the Union will be materially obstructed. The
injury of such a regulation would be very limited in the Atlantic

SUPREME

COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

States, as there the rivers are short, and navigation is generally
limited to the ebb and flow of the tide. If the Wheeling bridge
be a legal structure, hundreds of bridges on the same principle
may be thrown over the Mississippi and its navigable tributaries,
to the great and remediless injury of western commerce.
That commerce is rapidly increasing, and at this time it probably amounts to four hundred millions of dollars annually; and
if the Father of Waters and his tributaries shall have the same
regulation extended to them as is now applied to the Wheeling
bridge, it will impose a tax upon western commerce of several
hundred thousand dollars annually; and this will be, not for the
advancement of commerce over those waters, as it will greatly
obstruct it, but to save a few thousand dollars in the structure of
each bridge.
In regard to the motion for process of contempt against the
bridge company, we must, I think, be governed by matters which
appear upon the record. Shortly after the first decree was
entered, the defendants made application to congress for relief.
The object of the bridge company iu making this application, was
to counteract and annul the decision of this court. It is not supposed, however, that such was the intention of congress in passing the law. The two sections referred to were moved as an
amendment to an act making appropriations for the service of
the post-office department, on the 31st of August, 1852, at the
close of that session. But little time was afforded for investigation of the important questions involved in the act. This fact is
not stated to impair the force and effect of the act, but I think it
is fit to be considered on this motion, in regard to the conduct of
the bridge company.
The court may properly consider, if they are not bound to do
so, that the defendants, in making application to congress, and in
procuring the passage of the act, as having acted in good faith.
And although the law, if it has been passed in violation of the
constitution, cannot be held valid, yet it may save the defendants
from the contempt charged. On its face, it gave to the bridge
company all that it could desire or ask against the decree of this
court. It legalized what the court held to be illegal; and it required all steamboats, running to and from Pittsburg, from any
point below Wheeling, to regulate their chimneys so as to pass
under the bridge. It was the exercise of a judicial power without an examination of the principles of law applicable, and without a knowledge of the facts on which the decree was founded.
No imputation is cast upon that honorable body, but the fact
must be known to every one that the senate and house of representatives, however distinguished for their high ability and legal
learning, could not discharge, to the public advantage, the duties
of an appellate court.

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

I have no doubt that the learned judge had power to grant
the injunction. The 5th section of the act of the 2d of March,
1793, (1 Stats. at Large, 334,) declares "that writs of ne exeat
and of injunction may be granted by any judge of the supreme
court, in cases where they might be granted by the supreme or
circuit court." The 14th section of the judiciary act of 1789
declares that "the courts of the United States shall have power
to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs
not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary
for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable
to the principles and usages of law."
Six of my brethren now hold that the act of congress arrested
the progress of the court in carrying their decree into effect, and
gave the defendants a right to rebuild their bridge. The injunction prohibited them from reconstructing it; can the defendants
be punished for contempt, for doing that which the law authorized ? This view shows that the injunction ought not to have
been granted, as it was against law. And is not this a sufficient
excuse for the contempt charged ? My view is, that the law was
unconstitutional and void, and yet I consider it as excusing the
defendants' contempt. I cannot punish defendants, by fine or
imprisonment, for doing that which the law authorized them
to do.
There was no opposition made when the injunction was applied for; and it was granted, as a matter of course, on the face
of the bill. Had the act of congress been set up against the
allowance of the injunction, the motion, in all probability, would
have been referred to the supreme court by the judge.
Having come to the conclusion, for the reasons above stated,
that the act of congress is inoperative and void, although it may
excuse the contempt, it can afford no excuse for a further refusal
to perform the decree. I would, therefore, order that the final
decree, heretofore made, be carried into effect according to its
true intent, by the first day of October next, and that the defendants pay the costs.
Mr. Justice GRIER.
I concur with the majority of this court, that in cases where
this court has original jurisdiction, an interlocutory or preliminary injunction may be awarded, in vacation, by any judge of
the court. I differ with the majority in declining to punish a
wanton contempt of the process of the court.
I concur with my brother McLean, that congress cannot annul or vacate any decree of this court; that the assumption of
such a power is without precedent, and, as a precedent for the
future, it is of dangerous example.

450

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

Mr. Justice WAYNE.
I concur with Mr. Justices Nelson, Grier, and Curtis, in thinking that the attachment for contempt should have been granted
by this court.
I concur with the majority of the court in the view taken by
them of the liability of the defendants for the costs of this suit.
I dissent from the majority of the court in the opinion given,
that the 6th and 7th sections of the act of the 31st August,
1852, (10 Stats. at Large, 112,) relieve the defendants from the
operation of the judgment of. this court in behalf of the plaintiff. That judgment was for the abatement of a nuisance of
which the plaintiff complained. This court decided it was a
nuisance, causing injury and great pecuniary loss, inasmuch as
it prevented the State of Pennsylvania from navigating the Ohio
River at all stages of its waters, to the uninterrupted navigation
of which they had a right under the constitution of the United
States. I know of no power in congress to interfere with such
a judgment, under the pretence of a power to legalize the structure of bridges over the public navigable rivers of the United
States, either within the States, or dividing States from each
other, or under the commercial power of congress to regulate
commerce among the States. Nor does the power of congress
to establish post-offices and post-roads give any power to congress to do more between the States, or within the States, than
to declare the routes for carrying the mails upon roads already
existing, and to designate the localities upon those roads where
post-offices shall be kept for the delivery and transmission of
letters, and other things or parcels which congress may declare
to be mailable. Whatever congress may have intended by the
act of August, 1852, I do not think it admits of the interpretation given to it by the majority of the court; and if it does, then
my opinion is that the act would be unconstitutional.
I concur with many of the views taken by Mr. Justice McLean
in his dissenting opinion; but I shall take another opportunity
to express my opinion fully upon the action of this court and of
congress in this case.
Mr. Justice DANIEL.
In the decision of the court dissolving the injunction and refusing the coercive measures asked for in this case, I entirely
concur. But as, in the argument by which the court have proceeded to their conclusions, important questions of constitutional
law appear to me to have been, some of them, passed over without consideration, and others inaccurately expounded, convictions of duty impel me to express my own interpretation of
those questions. The correctness or incorrectness of that inter-

pretation is left to the judgment of those whom curiosity or interest may incline to its examination; but whether examined, or
approved, or condemned, or otherwise, it has been given because
commanded by a sense of obligation, from obedience to which I
hold that no one is or can be absolved.
When the controversy now revived before us was, in January,
1850, for the first time brought to our attention, there suggested
themselves to my mind serious difficulties with respect both to
the authority and the mode by which it was attempted to place
that controversy within the cognizance of this tribunal.
I was unable to perceive by what warrant a judge of a circuit
court, circumscribed in his jurisdictioi both as to parties and to
subjects-matter of litigation within specified limits, could claim
cognizance as to parties and subjects-matter confessedly beyond
the prescribed bounds of his jurisdiction. Still less could I comprehend by what warrant a circuit judge could, by an interlocutory order at chambers, relative to rights of person and property
beyond the bounds of his jurisdiction, transfer a controversy affecting subjects thus situated to the supreme court of the United
States.
An attempt to avoid these difficulties (for they were not directly met) was essayed, by the assumption that the application
to the circuit court might be adopted here, as the commencement of an original suit by the State of Pennsylvania, that State
possessing the right to institute an action in the supreme court,
under the provision in the constitution which defines the original
jurisdiction of that court. Accordingly, this case was received
and treated as one authorized by the constitution, in virtue of
the original jurisdiction vested exclusively in the supreme court,
a jurisdiction which an inferior court, or a judge of an inferior
court, could have no power to exert.
However irregular and unauthorized the first proceeding in
this case appeared to me, the granting of the second injunction,
and the measures directed for enforcing it, I am constrained to
regard as still more irregular, -a much wider departure from
precedent or legitimate authority.
This second proceeding brings to our notice the following
state of facts: An application to a circuit judge at chambers,
to control by compulsory process persons and property, both of
them situated beyond and without the bounds of his legitimate
power. This application is granted at chambers, and not by a
proceeding in court at all; and the order of the judge so made,
and the mandate directed by him singly for the execution of his
order, are entitled as a proceeding in and before the supreme
court, and as an act of the supreme court; and the peculiar and
appropriate officer of this tribunal is ordered to carry that mandate into effect.

452

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

According to my interpretation of the constitution of the
United States, the supreme court is a distinct, aggregate, collective body,- one which can act collectively, and in term or in
united session only. It cannot delegate its functions, nor can
it impose its duties upon any number of the body less than a
quorum, constituted of a majority of its members. Much less can
a single judge be clothed with its joint powers, to be wielded by
him at any time or in any place, or to any extent to which his
individual discretion may point. Yet, in the case before us, we
have a proceeding begun, prosecuted, and consummated in the
name of the supreme court, - nay, denominated their proper act,
when eight of the nine judges constituting this tribunal had no
participation in that proceeding, perhaps never even suspected
its existence. It may very well be inquired whether a majority
of the judges, either acting individually or collectively in court,
would, on principles of power or of justice, have sanctioned the
course pursued in this case ? For one, I can answer that by
him it would have been unhesitatingly rejected.
Yet this course it is now attempted to justify and sustain,
under the 5th section of the act of congress of the 2d of March,
1793, (1 Stats. at Large, 334,) which provides that "writs of ne
exeat and injunction may be granted by any judge of the supreme
court in cases where they might be granted by the supreme court
or a circuit court."
The inference sought to be drawn from the provision just cited
I propose cursorily to examine, with the view of showing its incorrectness as a deduction from the language or the purposes of
that provision, and especially with the view of exposing the total
inapplicability of the attempted conclusion to the facts developed
by the record before us.
The subjects embraced within the proposed inquiry, namely,
the distribution and exercise of power in the different divisions
of the federal judiciary- the definition and establishment of the
distinctive boundaries within which those several divisions should
revolve, are matters of an importance much too grave to be incidentally or lightly disposed of. They are matters inseparable
alike from the order and harmony and stability of public authority, and from the safety and enjoyment of private right.
By the act of congress establishing the judicial courts of the
United States, (1 Stats. at Large, 81,) no power was conferred
upon the judges of the courts of the United States to grant
writs of injunction; nor was the power to grant an injunction
eo wmite conferred upon any of the courts. This authority
was, however, as to the courts, given by implication in the 14th
section of the statute, which authorized the courts thereinbefore
enumerated, to grant writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

453

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may
be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions.
The feature of this provision proper for consideration here is
this: that the power was conferred upon the courts, and not
upon the judges, and was given in cases only in which it was
necessary for the exercise of the jurisdiction of those courts.
What was the jurisdiction of the circuit courts, as to persons or
property, or both ? With respect to proceedings ink rem, as the
process of the court could not run beyond the prescribed limits
of its appropriate district, the jurisdiction or power of the court
could be coextensive only with those limits, and was consequently impotent and null as to any direct control of the subject-matter when situated beyond them. And with respect to
the jurisdiction over persons or parties, we find it declared by
the 11th section of the judiciary act, that "no civil suit shall be
brought before either of the said courts, against an inhabitant
of the United States, in any other district than that whereof he
is an inhabitant, or in which lie shall be found at the time of
serving the writ" ; and so careful have been the authors of this
restriction to insure its effectual observance, that in the same
section of the statute they have prohibited every transfer of the
interests or rights of parties made with the view of evading its
operation. An interpretation of the 11th section of the judiciary act-one conclusive upon the jurisdiction of the circuit courts
-has
been declared in repeated decisions by this court, as may
be seen amongst other instances which might be adduced, in
the cases of M'Micken v. Webb, 11 Pet. 36 ; of Toland v. Sprague,
12 Pet. p. 300; and of Keary v. The Farmers' and Mechanics'
Bank of Memphis, 16 Pet. p. 89. In the second of the cases
just cited, the effect of the statute in defining the jurisdiction
of the circuit courts is examined with much minuteness and
particularity.
It follows, then, by necessary induction, both from the language of the judiciary act and from the interpretation thereof by
this court, that the jurisdiction - as auxiliary to which, and as a
means of enforcing its exercise, the power to grant injunctions
was conferred upon the circuit courts- is that jurisdiction restricted to persons and property found within the prescribed local
bounds assigned to those courts.
But it has been argued, that whilst the restrictions above mentioned may be imposed upon the courts as such, in the most
solemn and deliberate exercise of their functions, the judges individually, out of court, and distinguished as they are by the
language of the law from the courts, have been released from
the same or similar restraints, and have been clothed with power
separately to exert this extraordinary jurisdiction over persons

SUPREME COURT.
State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

and property residing or situated anywhere and everywhere
within the United States. Nothing more is required, according
to this argument, to overstep the fixed and designated boundary
of the courti' authority than the sic jubeo of the individual
judge.
In considering the interpretation now placed upon the 5th section of the act of March 2, 1793, the mind is impressed with the
irregularity and inconsistency which this interpretation implies;
and with the inutility and inefficiency for any beneficial object,
of the power it is said to have created. It is certainly a novelty,
and an anomaly in jurisprudence, to allege in a judicial officer
acting out of court, and as it were in pais, the existence of a
jurisdiction over persons and property with respect to which he
has no power to adjudicate in court, and his acts in relation to
which he possesses no authority to reverse or modify or even to
revise. Yet this is precisely the attitude which the circuit courts
and the judges of those courts are made to occupy in relation to
each other, by the interpretation now attempted.
In the next place, so far as usefulness or efficiency may be
supposed to have been the objects of the statute, much of these
are taken away by denying to the courts the power claimed for
the judges out of court to act upon persons or property beyond
the bounds of the respective circuits. The same necessity which
would dictate a resort to one, requiring equally a resort to both
or either.
Some obscurity and difficulty is perceived and felt as arising
from that portion of § 5 of the act of March 2, 1793, which permits the judges of the circuit courts to grant injunctions in cases
wherein they might be granted by the supreme court; but this
language it is thought, when correctly understood, operates no
change, or extension, or enlargement of the powers and jurisdiction of the circuit courts, or of the judges of those courts. If
indeed it should be contended that this section of the statute
was designed to confer, or by its terms purported to confer upon
the circuit courts, or upon the judges thereof, the jurisdictiun
and functions of the supreme court, then must that section, so
far at least, be rejected as absolutely void, being in violation of
the constitution.
The supreme court of the United States is the creature of the
constitution. By this instrument its powers and jurisdiction,
original and appellate, are conferred and defined; these are
peculiar and exclusive, and by no legislation can they be enlarged or diminished, much less can they either in whole or in
part, be delegated to other tribunals or officers of any grade or
description.
I am clearly of the opinion, therefore, that by the 5th section

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

455

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

of the act of 1793, no power to exercise authority or jurisdiction
appertaining to the supreme court was, or could have been, conferred either upon the circuit courts or upon the judges thereof;
but that this section must be understood as simply conferring
upon the judges a power previously confined to the courts alone,
- namely, the power to grant injunctions, and this subject to
every limitation by which the circuit courts were controlled.
But the interpretation of the act of 1793 now contended for,
broad as it is, still is not wide enough to cover the proceeding
which it is now used to shield and protect. To accomplish this
end, it must be stretched still more ; and until it can be made to
comprise an identification of a single judge of the supreme court
with the entire court itself, and the transformation of an act by
an individual judge - an act performed without the accustomed
formalities of a regular court - into a proceeding by the supreme
court in the exercise of its constitutional and only legitimate
functions.
The order granting the second injunction in this case, were it
obnoxious to no other objection, appears to me to be unwarranted and void, for the reason that it assumes to contravene
and overrule in effect, if not in terms, an existing decree of this
court, between these same parties and upon the same subjectmatter.
The decree of this court, first pronounced in February, 1852,
decided that the suspension bridge at Wheeling was an obstruction to the passage of steamboats on the Ohio River, and that
unless it should be elevated to the height of one hundred and
eleven feet above low-water mark, before the 1st day of February next following this decree, it should be abated. Upon a
subsequent day of the same term, the decree was so modified as
to substitute for the requirement of increased elevation, or of the
alternative of an abatement, permission to the proprietors of the
suspension bridge to construct in the permanent wooden bridge,
which spans the western channel of the river, a draw of a capacity sufficient for the passage of steamboats of the largest class;
the additional distance or the short delay (of a few minutes only)
incident to this arrangement constituting, as expressed in the
language of this court, "no appreciable injury to commerce."
Liberty was reserved by this decree to either party to "move the
court in relation to this matter on the 1st Monday of February
ensuing."
Vide 13 How. 625.
In obedience to a notice from the complainant, under the liberty reserved in the decree, the defendants appeared on the regular return day by counsel in court; but the complainant failing
to prosecute this motion, it was permitted to be discontinued.
To a second notice to the defendants they again appeared, but

456

SUPREME COURT.

State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Co.

the complainant again making default, was formally called, and
the motion was dismissed.
From this failure or refusal on the part of those who were
'authorized to move in the case, this court, for aught that could
be judicially known to them, might have been justified in the
conclusion, that everything they had ordered had been complied
with, or had been arranged to the mutual satisfaction of the
parties. Certainly up to this period, there was no fact regularly
and formally before them, on which to found or justify process
for contempt. Under this state of things, the suspension bridge
at Wheeling remained, and was authorized to remain.
This court had prescribed the conditions, according to which
it was to stand or to be abated, and had designated the parties
by whom, the modes by which, and the extent to which, the
decree might be carried into effect.
In this attitude of the case, a mandate is issued from a judge
at chambers, superseding the mode pointed out by this court for
the execution of its decree, dild wholly irrespective of any condition according to which that decree had been, by its own
terms, modified, as above mentioned.
The above mandate assumes to order, in the name of this
court, that no bridge of an elevation less than that prescribed by
this order, shall be thrown across the Ohio from Zane's Island
to Wheeling, regardless altogether of any facility, however complete, which might be provided for the passage of steamboats by
the western channel of the river.
This mandate, therefore, was itself a palpable violation of the
decree of this court, and of rights reserved to the defendants by
that decree, - rights which they twice evinced their readiness to
vindicate before this court, in opposition to the reiterated, but
subsequently abandoned attempts by the complainant to assail
them.
Can contempt, then, be affirmed or imputed with reference to
a readiness to yield obedience to the regular authority of the
court, or with reference to an unwillingness to comply with a
proceeding not merely void in itself, but one also in manifest
violation of the constitution and the law?
To which it may be asked, were the defendants bound to conform to the authority of this court, deliberately announced upon
a question regularly before them as a court, or to an order from
a single judge, obviously in contravention of the former, assuming to exercise an authority belonging only to the court as an
aggregate body, and by which assumption this court is placed
in an attitude adversary to its own decree ?
There is still another view of this case, which, to my mind, is
conclusive against the proceedings on the part of the circuit

457

judge, and equally so against every motion now urged before
us as founded thereon, or on either the principal or modified
decree heretofore pronounced in this cause.
Previously to the application for the second injunction, the
congress of the United States, by a formal statutory enactment,
declared the bridges which had been erected over the Ohio at
Wheeling in Virginia, and at Bridgeport in the State of Ohio,
abutting on Zane's Island, to be lawful structures in their
present position and elevation, "anything in any law or laws
of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding." And
they further enacted, "that the officers and crews of all vessels
and boats navigating the said river, are required to regulate the
use of their said vessels and boats, and any pipes, or chimney,
or chimneys belonging thereto, so as not to interfere with the
Vide 10 Stats.
elevation and structure of the said bridges."
at Large, 112.
Against the effect of these very explicit enactments, it has
been contended that they are void, because, as it is said, they reverse a decision of this court, which congress has no power to
do. In answer to this argument, it may be conceded that the
position assumed by it might be true with reference to the adjustment or security of private rights vested under previously
existing laws or adjudications; but such a position is wholly
inapplicable to measures of public policy falling appropriately
within the legislative competency, and much less can it have
any influence to warrant in any other department of the government the exercise of powers vested exclusively in the national
legislature.
It is impossible to read either the original or the modified
decree, by the majority of the court in this cause, without perceiving that both these decrees, as well as the entire argument
in support of them, were based upon the single assumption that
the erection of the suspension bridge at Wheeling was an interference with the right to regulate commerce vested in congress
by the constitution. It is equally manifest, from the arguments
and opinions of the minority of the court, that the right in congress to regulate commerce is not only conceded by the minority,
but the exclusiveness of that power in congress is insisted upon.
These later opinions maintain the doctrine that congress alone
are competent to exercise this right or power, and can neither
be controlled nor anticipated with respect to it by the judicial
department, upon any fancied necessity, nor upon any supposed
neglect, or omission, or incompetency, which the latter may impute to congress, and may imagine the judicial department called
upon to remedy.
In these views are seen essentially, nay explicitly, the diversity

existing in the opinions of the majority and minority of the
judges, as declared in this case.
Congress have, by statute already referred to, undertaken to
regulate the commerce upon the Ohio River, so far as the matters involved in this controversy are concerned. And who shall
question their power to do this ? Does it belong to this court,
under any article or clause of the constitution, or of any statute,
to assume such a superiority? Congress have ordained that
the vehicles of commerce on the Ohio, the steamboats, shall so
graduate the height of their chimneys, as not to interfere with
the bridges at Wheeling, as existing at the date of the statute.
By this they have at least declared that these bridges are deemed
by them no invasion either of the power or the policy of congress with reference to the commerce of the Ohio River. They
have regulated this matter upon a scale by them conceived to
be just and impartial, with reference to that commerce which
pursues the course of the river, and to that which traverses its
channel, and is broadly diffused th.rough the country.
They have at the same time by what they have done, secured
to the government, and to the public at large, the essential adva-itage of a safe and certain transit over the Ohio, -an advantage which, previously to the erection of the Wheeling bridge,
was greatly desired, but never attained.
In what has been done by congress, I can have no doubt that
they have acted wisely, justly, and strictly within their constitutional competency. By their action they have completely overthrown every foundation upon which the decrees of this court,
the orders of the circuit judge, and every motion purporting to
be based upon these or either of them, could rest. I am, therefore, of the opinion that each and every motion submitted by
the complainant under color of the decrees heretofore pronounced
in this cause, or of the injunction awarded by the judge of the
circuit court, should be overruled ; that the injunction awarded
as aforesaid should be dissolved, and the bill praying for that
injunction should be dismissed; and that in each instance the
defendants should be decreed their costs.
Order- in the originalcase.
This court at a prior term, to wit, ort 27th May, 1852, having
declared that the bridge of the respondents was an obstruction
to the navigation of the Ohio River, and that it did a special
damage to the complainant, and having decreed that the same
should be altered as thereby directed, or removed by the respondents, and the complainant having subsequently moved this
court for writs of assistance, of sequestration and of attachment against the said respondents, and also for a taxation of

the costs decreed by this court, and for the process of this court
to enforce the payment thereof by the said respondents, and the
congress of the United States having by an act passed on the
81st of August, 1852, entitled "An Act making appropriations
for the service of the Post-Office Department, during the fiscal
year ending the 80th of June, 1853, and for other purposes,"
provided for the navigation of the Ohio River, and so regulated
the navigation of the said river as to be consistent with the
maintenance of the said bridge. And the respective parties
having been fully heard by counsel, and after mature deliberation
thereupon had by this court, it is now here considered and decreed by this court that the said motion for writs of assistance,
sequestration, and attachment be and the same is hereby overruled, and that the said writs be and they are hereby denied.
And it is further considered and decreed by the court that the
said complainant do have and recover from the said respondents
the costs of the said complainant as decreed by this court on the
aforesaid 27th day of May, A. D. 1852, to be taxed by the clerk,
and that the said respondents do pay the same to the complainant within ninety days from this date; and that in default
of such payment, that execution do issue therefor to be directed
to the marshal of the United States for the District of Columbia
to enforce the same.

injunction issued by his order.
This cause came on to be heard upon the bill of complaint,
an order by the Honorable R. C. Grier, an associate justice of
this court, on the 26th day of June, 1854, granting an injunction
as prayed for in the said bill, and upon the motion by the complainant for writs of assistance, of sequestration, and of attachment against the said respondent, and upon a motion by the
respondent to dissolve the said injunction, and was fully argued
by counsel on both sides; upon consideration whereof, and
after mature deliberation thereupon had, it is now here ordered
and decreed by this court that the said motion by the said complainant for writs of assistance, of sequestration, and of attachment be and the same is hereby overruled, and that the said
injunction, so as aforesaid granted, be and the same is hereby
dissolved.
