nor to the measure of relief decreed, nor with respect to the
party against whom that relief has been granted. We therefore order that the decree of the district court of Iowa be
affirmed.

JOHN

J. ORTON, APPELLANT, V. GEORGE SMITH.

Those only who have a clear, legal, and equitable title to land, connected with possession, have a right to claim the interference of a court of equity, to give them peace or
dissipate a cloud on the title.
Therefore, where the complainant was the volunteer purchaser of a litigious claim;
was the assignee of a secret equity for apparently a mere nominal consideration,
and of the bare legal title for a like consideration, and this legal title assigned to
him during the pendency of a suit in chancery in a State court, to ascertain the person justly entitled to it, it was error in the court below to grant to such complainant a perpetual injunction.
The courts of the United States should not entertain a bill of peace upon a title in
litigation in a state court.

THis was an appeal from the district court of the United
States, for the district of Wisconsin.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

It was argued by Mr. Gillett and fr. yjnde, for the appellant,
and .Mr. Brown, for the appellee. There was also a brief filed
on the same side by 1r. Upham.
The points made by the counsel were so interwoven with the
facts, that they cannot be presented abstractedly.
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.
The bill, in this case, is in the nature of a "bill of peace," as
authorized by the statutes of Wisconsin. Smith, the claimant
below, claimed to be owner of certain lands, to which Orton
claimed also to have some title. The bill prays an injunction
against Orton, to prohibit him from setting up his claim, and
thereby "casting a cloud" over the good legal title of complainalit.

The facts of the case are somewhat complex, and its merits
will be better apprehended by a succinct history of them, as
elicited from the pleadings and evidence.
Hubbard had settled in Wisconsin, having escaped from his
creditors, with some pecuniary means, which he thought it prudent to conceal. Hence, though he speculated in the purchase
and sale of lands, the title to them was held by friends. He
had contracted to sell certain lots in Milwaukie to Schram.

264

SUPREME COURT
Orton v. Smith.

But Schram would not pay his money without a good legal
title, or good security that it should be conveyed to him. Hubbard resided in the family of his friend Butler, and being addicted to idleness and intemperance, he confided the management of his affairs, in a great measure, to Butler. Schram
would not pay his money on the security of Butler or the
promise of Hubbard to obtain a title ; and one Knab at length
was prevailed on to enter into a bond with Butler, conditioned
that a good legal title should be made to Schram for the lots.
But Knab was unwilling to enter into this bond without security
also. For this purpose the land in dispute in this suit was conveyed to him in fee by one Cyrus D. Davis, who held the legal
title as friend and trustee of Hubbard. This deed was put on
record by Knab, who, at the same time, gave his title-bond
covenanting to convey the land to Butler, when the covenants
of their bond to Schram would be satisfied or released. This
title-bond was not given to Davis, because he claimed no beneficial interest in the land; nor to Hubbard, because his policy
required him not to appear to have any title to property; but to
Butler, the friend and active agent of Hubbard. Notwithstanding the testimony of Butler, that he paid Hubbard for the land,
and did not hold as secret trustee for him, the fact may be considered doubtful ; and it is not necessary to decide it, in our
view of the present case. Hubbard is now deceased; but in
his lifetime he assigned, for the consideration of one dollar, all
his interest in the land in dispute to one Gruenhagen, (under
whom Smith, the complainant, claims,) by deed dated in June,
1851.
On the 22d of February, 1851, Butler assigned to Orton, the
defendant, the title-bond of Knab for the consideration of $ 2,100.
This consideratioa has been paid without any knowledge or
notice of any secret equity in Hubbard; and the covenants of
the bond to Schram being fulfilled or released, Orton filed his
bill in chancery on the 6th of August, 1851, against Knab, demanding from him a conveyance of the legal title according to
the exigency of his bond.
During the pendency of this bill, which would settle the legal
and equitable rights of all persons having any claim to the land
in dispute, the complainant, Smith, becomes the purchaser of
the real or supposed secret equity of Hubbard. And not only
so, but he has obtained from Knab the transfer of the legal title
for a nominal consideration ; thereby substituting himself in the
place of Knab in the contest pending in the state court. The
charge of fraud made in the bill, because Knab's title-bond was
made to Butler and not to Hubbard, is not substantiated. It
was a matter of indifference to Knab whether Hubbard or But-

ler held the bond. He had no concern with the private arrangements or secret trusts between them. When the condition of
his bond to Schram was released, Knab was bound to convey
to Butler, by the exigency of his own contract, and could not
make himself a judge of the equities between Butler and Hubbard. His assignment to Smith, under the circumstances, could
have no effect but to substitute Smith in his own place, under
the same liabilities.
On this state of the facts the court below decreed the title to
the land to be in Smith.
"And further, that the said defendant, John J. Orton, be, and
hereby is, perpetually enjoined and forever barred from setting
up or asserting any claim in or right to said premises, by virtue
of or upon said bond and assignment. But this injunction and
decree are not in any way to affect or operate against him, the
said John J. Orton, in the prosecution of a bill pending in the
circuit court of Milwaukie county, in this State, wherein he is
complainant, and David Knab is defendant; this court not intending to enjoin a proceeding in the state court."
We think the court erred in entering such a decree. Those
only who have a clear, legal, and equitable title to land connected with possession, have any right to claim the interference
of a court of equity to give them peace or dissipate a cloud on
the title.
The complainant in this case is the volunteer purchaser of a
litigious claim; he is the assignee of a secret equity for apparently a mere nominal consideration, and of the bare legal
title for a like consideration. This legal title was improperly
assigned to him, during the pendency of a suit in chancery to
ascertain the person justly entitled to it.
Besides, the decree in this case demonstrates the impropriety
of the interference of the court of the United States, and of its
entertaining jurisdiction of a question of title then pending in
the state court. It is true, if this were an ejectment in a court
of law, the pendency of another ejectment between the same
parties might not have afforded sufficient ground for q plea of,
auter action pendent; nor would the court have been bound,
even by comity, to await the decision of the state court, or
suffer the cause pending before them to be in any way affected
by it. But a decree of a court of chancery, on a bill of peace,
must necessarily operate by way of estoppel, as to the title of
the land, and conclude all the parties to it, because it should
put an end to all litigation between them. If they have suits
pending in other courts, on the same question of title, they
must cease. This bill acts by injunction, on the party - no injunction ever goes to the court having a concurrent jurisdiction

of the question. The courts of the United States have no such
power over suitors in a state court. But a decree on a bill of
peace which does not put an end to litigation is a mere brutum
fulmen. Unless the court can make a decree which it can execute, it is a sufficient reason for refusing to take cognizance of
the case. It is a rule absolutely necessary to be observed by
courts who have a concurrent jurisdiction, that in all cases
"where the jurisdiction of a court and the right of a plaintiff to
prosecute his suit in it have once attached, that right cannot be
arrested or taken away by proceedings in another court." This
rule, it is said, "has its foundation not merely in comity, but in
necessity. If one may enjoin, the other may retort by injunction, and thus the parties be without remedy." See Peck v.
Jenness, 7 How. 625; Taylor v. Royal Saxon, 1 Wall, 311.
If the decree in this case can 'be of any value whatever, let us
look at the consequences which may possibly and probably will
arise, in case it is enforced.
Orton, claiming as the bond fide assignee and purchaser of
the title-bond given by Knab, has a bill pending in the state
court to compel a transfer of the legal title. Pending this litigation, Knab assigns the legal title to a citizen of another State,
who comes into the court of the United States praying an injunction against Orton from setting up his title. Suppose the
state court decrees the title to be in Orton, and compels Knab
and Smith, his assignee, to release the legal title to him? Now
the court below has made a decree that enjoins Orton from ever
setting up his title against Smith. It is true the decree protests
against interference with proceedings in a state court: but unless it is construed so as to be a perfect "felo de se," it must be
enforced in favor of complainant somehow. When the sheriff
puts Orton in possession under the decree of the state court,
and expels Smith, the circuit court, by its officer, must replace
Smith, or imprison Orton for a contempt. This would indeed
be a humiliating spectacle. Such a disreputable collision of
jurisdictions should be sedulously avoided. This can only be
done by yefusing to entertain a bill of peace for an injunction
when the title is in litigation in a court of concurrent jurisdiction ; otherwise, the result of a bill of peace may be not peace,
but war; and, instead of dispelling a "cloud" from the title of
either party, will doubly increase the darkness and difficulty with
which it was environedDecree of the circuit court is therefore reversed, and the bill
dismissed with costs -but without prejudice.
