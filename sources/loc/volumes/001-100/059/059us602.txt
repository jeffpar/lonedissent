SUPREME

COURT.

Strader et al. v. Graham.

JACOB STRADER AND OTHERS, PLAINTFS IN EROR, V- CHRISTOPHER GRAHAM.
Where a case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction this court cannot give a judgment
for costs.

TIS case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction, at December
term, 1850, 10 How. 82.
At the present term, Mfr. Crittenden, of counsel for the defendant in error, moved the court to amend the judgment entered in
this cause at the December term, 1850, and to give a judgment
for the costs in this court in favor of his client. Whereupon it is
now here considered by the court that this court cannot give a
judgment for costs in a case dismissed for want of jurisdiction,
and it appearing to this court that this cause has been dismissed
for want of jurisdiction, it is thereupon now here ordered by
the court that the said motion be and the same is hereby overruled.
