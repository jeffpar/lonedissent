A distress warrant, issued by the solicitor of the treasury under the act of congress
passed on the 15th May, 1820, (3 Stats. at Large, 592,) is not inconsistent with the
constitution of the United States.
It was an exercise of executive and not of judicial power, according to the meaning
of those words in the constitution ; and the privilege allowed to a collector to bring
the question of his indebtedness before the courts of the United States, is merely
the consent of congress to the suit, which is given in other classes of cases also.
Neither is it inconsistent with that part of the constitution which prohibits a citizen
from being deprived of his liberty or property without due process of law. The
historical and critical meaning of these words examined.
By the common law of England and the laws of many of the colonies before the revolution, and of States before the formation of the federal constitution, a summary
process existed for the recovery of debts due to the government.
It does not necessarily follow that the adjustment of these balances is a controversy to
which the United States is a party, within the meaning of the constitution.
Under the power of congress to collect taxes and the exercise of that power by the act
above mentioned, the warrant of distress is conclusive evidence of the facts recited
in it and of the authority to make the levy, so far as to iustify the marshal in making
it ; but the question of indebtedness may be the subject of a suit, congress having
assented thereto, and the levy may provide security for the event of the suit.
The article of the constitution, requiring an oath or affirmation for a warrant, has no
application to proceedings for the recovery of debts, where no search warrant is
used.
The return of the marshal that he had levied on lands, by virtue of such a warrant, is,
at least, prima facie evidence that the levy was not irregular by reason of the existence of goods and chattels of the collector subject to his process.

THESE three cases came up from the circuit court of the
United States for the district of New Jersey, tpon a certificate

of division in opinion between the judges thereof.
As the opinion of the court answers only the third question,
it may be proper to say that the first two related to a mortgage
executed by Henry Ogden, as the attorney in fact of Swartwout,
to Henry D. Gilpin, solicitor of the treasury. It was necessary
to the case of the plaintiffs to get rid of this mortgage in the first
instance, and afterwards to avoid the sale under the distress
warrant. If they failed in the last, the points raised in the first
two questions became of no practical consequence, and, therefore, answers to them were not returned by this court.

The case is stated in the opinion of the court. The decision
of one involved the two others, as they depended upon the same
rinciples.
I It was argued by Mf'. Van Winkle and Mir. Wood fur the plaintiffs, and by Yr. Zabrinski. Mr. Gillett, Mr. Butler, and Mr.
Bradley, for tihe defendants.

The points relating to the power of attorney and the mortgage
need not be noticed.
The counsel for the plaintiffs contended that the acts of congress, authorizing these proceedings under a distress warrant,
were unconstitutional and void, because, The proceeding to establish this claim was, in its nature, a
judicial proceeding, and couild only be carried out under the
judicial power. Const. U. S. art. 3, §§ 1, 2; 4 Devereux, 1, 13.
By the judicial power in the constitution, was meant that portion of such power which was recognized and understood to be
such at the time of the adoption of the constitution. Federalist,
No. 80; 2. Brock. 447.
This summary proceeding was considered and enforced as a
judgment at law. 8 Wheat. 212, 222.
The warrant to sell and imprison is an execution issued upon
a judgment. 9 Pet. 8.
The secretary of the treasury cannot be constituted a court for
the exercise of judicial power. Const. U. S. art. 3, § 1.
The power of review of law and fact, given by the act to a
court, does not change these views.
The proceeding in question took place without any hearing
by the debtor and without a trial by jury, and is, therefore, unconstitutional and void. Article 7 of Amendments to Constitu4
tion; 5 Johns. 37.
As process, it w'as unconstitutional, because it changed the
onus, and required the debtor to disprove the debt.
This process deprives of liberty and property without due
process of law, contrary to the 5th article of amendments to
the constitution.
This meant, by process of law, as then understood, charge,
defence, judgment before and by a legally constituted court.

But it does not appear that there were no goods or chattels
upon which to levy; on the contrary, that the marshal levied
upon some, but failed to sell them.

the adoption of the federal constitution. 3 Black. Com. 3, 6.

Mr. Justice CURTIS delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes before us on a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court of the United States for the
district of New Jersey. It is an action of ejectment, in which
both parties claim title under Samuel Swartwout, -the plaintiffs,
under the levy of an execution on the 10th day of April. 1839,
and the defendants, under a sale made by the marshal of the
United States for the district of New Jersey, on the 1st day of
June, 1839, - by virtue of what is denominated a distress warrant, issued by the solicitor of the treasury under the act of congress of May 15, 1820, entitled, "An act providing for the better
organization of the treasury department." This act having provided, by its first section, that a lien for the amount due should
exist on the lands of the debtor from the time of the levy and
record thereof in the office of the district court of the United
States for the proper district, and the date of that levy in this
case being prior to the date of the judgment under which the
plaintiffs' title was made, the question occurred in the circuit
court, "whether the said warrant of distress in the special verdict mentioned, and the proceedings thereon and anterior thereto,
under which the defendants claim title, are sufficient, under the
constitution of the United States and the law of the land, to
pass and transfer the title and estate of the said Swartwout in

opinions, it was certified to this court, and has been argued by
counsel.

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

275

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

No objection has been taken to the warrant on account of any
defect or irregularity in the proceedings which preceded its issue.
It is not denied that they were in conformity with the requirements of the act of congress. The special verdict finds that
Swartwout was collector of the customs for the port of New
York for eight years before the 29th of March, 1838: that, on
the 10th of November, 1838, his account, as such" collector, was
audited by the first auditor, and certified by the first comptroller
of the treasury; and for the balance thus found, amounting to
the sum of $1,374,119- %,
the warrant in question was issued by
1
the solicitor of the treasury. Its validity is denied by the plaintiffs, upon the ground that so much of the act of congress as
authorized it is in conflict with the constitution of the United
States.
In support of this position, the plaintiff relies on that part of
the first section of the third article of the constitution which
requires the judicial power of the United States to be vested in
one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress may,
frpm time to time, ordain and establish; the judges whereof shall
hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times,
receive for their services a compensation, which shall not be
diminished during their continuance in office. Also, on the
second section of the same article, which declares that the judicial power shall extend to controversies to which the United
States shall be a party.
It must be admitted that, if the auditing of this account, and
the ascertainment of its balance, and the issuing of this process,

was an exercise of the judicial power of the United States, the
proceeding was void; for the officers who performed these acts
could exercise no part of that judicial power. They neither constituted a court of the United States, nor were they, or either of
them, so connected with any such court as to perform even any
of the ministerial duties which arise out of judicial proceedings.
The question, whether these acts were an exercise of the judicial power of the United States, can best be considered under another inquiry, raised by the further objection of the plaintiff, that
the effect of the probeedings authorized by the act in question is
to deprive the party, against whom the warrant issues, of his liberty and property, "without due process of law "; and, therefore, is in conflict with the fifth article of the amendments of the
constitution.
Taking these two objections together, they raise the questions,
whether, under the constitution of the United States, a collector
of the customs, from whom a balance of account has been found
to be due by accounting officer§ of the treasury, designated for
that purpose by law, can be deprived of his liberty, or property,

276

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

in order to enforce payment of that balance, without the exercise
of the judicial power of the United States, and yet by due process of law, within the meaning of those terms in the constitution; and if so, then, secondly, whether the warrant in question
was such due process of law?
The words, "due process of law," were undoubtedly intended
to convey the same meaning as the words, "by the law of the
land," in Bliagna harta. Lord Coke, in his commentary on
those words, (2 Inst. 50,) says they mean due process of law.
The constitutions which had been adopted by the several States
before the formation of the federal constitution, following the
language of the great charter more closely, generally contained
the words, "but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the
land." The ordinance of congress of July 13, 1787, for the government of the territory of the United States northwest of the
river Ohio, used the same words.
The constitution of the United States, as adopted, contained
the provision, that "the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury." When the fifth article of amendment containing the words now in question was made, the trial
by jury in criminal cases had thus already been provided for. By
the sixth and seventh articles of amendment, further special provisions were separately made for that mode of trial in civil and
criminal cases. To have followed, as in the state constitutions,
(Jharta, and
and in the ordinance of 1787, the words of 3 "gna
declared that no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or
property but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land,
would have been in part superfluous and inappropriate. To
have taken the clause, "law of the land," without its immediate
context, might possibly have given rise to doubts, which would
be effectually dispelled by using those words which the great
commentator on llfagna Charta had declared to be the true
meaning of the phrase, "law of the land," in that instrument, and
which were undoubtedly then received as their true meaning.
That the warrant now in question is legal process, is not denied. It was issued in conformity with an act of Congress.
But is it "due process of law" ? The constitution contains no
description of those processes which it was intended to allow or
forbid. It does not even declare what principles are to be applied to ascertain whether it be due process. It is manifest that
it was not left to the legislative power to enact any process
which might be devised. The article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the
government, and cannot be so construed as to leave congress
free to make any process "due process of law," by its mere will.
To what principles, then, are we to resort to ascertain whether

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

277

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Impivement Co.

this process, enacted by congress, is due process ? To this the
answer must be twofold. We must examine the constitution
itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its
provisions. If not found to be so, we must look to those settled
usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and
statue law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors,
and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil
and political condition by having been acted on by them after
the settlement of this country. We apprehend there has been
no period, since the establishment of the English monarchy,
when there has not been, by the law of the lan'd, a summary
method for the recovery of debts due to the crown, and especially
those due from receivers of the revenues. It is difficult, at this
day, to trace with preeision all the proceedings had for these
purposes in the earliest ages in the common law. That they
were summary and severe, and had been used for purposes of
oppression, is inferable from the fact that one chapter of ZXftna
Charta treats of their restraint. It declares: "We or our bailiffs shall not seize any land or rent for any debt as long as the
present goods and chattles of the debtor do suffice to pay the
debt, and the debtor himself be ready to satisfy therefor. Neither
shall the pledges of the debtor be distrained, as long as the principal debtor is sufficient for the payment of the debt; and if the
principal debtor fail in payment of the debt, having nothing
wherewith to pay, or will not pay where he is able, the pledges
shall answer for the debt. And if they will, they shall have the
lands and rents of the debtor until they be satisfied of the debt
which they before paid for him, except that the principal debtor
can show himself to be acquitted against the said sureties."
By the common law, the body, lands, and goods of the king's
debtor were liable to be levied on to obtain payment. In conformity with the above provision of MaXgna Charta, a conditional
writ was framed, commanding the sheriff to inquire of the goods
and chattels of the debtor, and, if they were insufficient, then to
extend on the lands. 3 Co. 12 b; Com. Dig., Debt, G. 2; 2 Inst.
19. But it is said that since the statute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 39, the
practice has been to issue the writ in an absolute form, without
requiring any previous inquisition as to the goods. Gilbert's
Exch. 127.
To authorize a writ of extent, however, the debt must be matter of record in the king's exchequer. The 33 Hen. VIIL c. 39,
§ 50, made all specialty debts due to the king of the same force
and effect as debts by statute staple, thus giving to such debts
the effect of debts of record. In regard to debts due upon simple contract, other than those due from collectors of the revenue
and other accountants of the crown, the practice, from very an24

cient times, has been to issue a commission to inquire as to the
existence of the debt.
This commission being returned, the debt found was thereby
evidenced by a record, and an extent could issue thereon. No
notice was required to be given to the alleged debtor of the execution of this commission, (2 Tidd's Pr. 1047,) though it seems
that, in some cases, an order for notice might be obtained. 1 Yes.
269. Formerly, no witnesses were examined by the commission, (Chitty's Prerog. 267 ; West, 22 ;) the affidavit prepared to
obtain an order for an immediate extent being the only evidence introduced. But this practice has been recently changed.
11 Pride, 29. By the statute 13 Eliz. ch. 4, balances due from
receivers of the revenue and all other accountants of the crown
were placed on the same footing as debts acknowledged to be
due by statute staple. These balances were found by auditors,
the particular officers acting thereon having been from time to
time varied by legislation and usage. The different methods
of accounting in ancient and modern times are described in Mr.
Price's Treatise on the Law and Practice of the Exchequer,
ch. 9. Such balances, when found, were certified to what was
called the pipe office, to be given in charge to the sheriffs for
their levy. Price, 231.
If an accountant fail to render his accounts, a process was
issued, termed a capias nornine districtionis, against the body,
goods, and lands of the accountant. Price, 162, 233, note 3.
This brief sketch. of the modes of proceeding to ascertain and
enforce payment of balances due from receivers of the revenue
in England, is sufficient to show that the methods of ascertaining the existence and amount of such debts, and compelling
their payment, have varied widely from the usual course of the
common law on other subjects; and that, as respects such debts
due from such officers, "the law of the land" authorized the employment of auditors, and an inquisition without notice, and a
species of execution bearing a very close resemblance to what is
termed a warrant of distress in the act of 1820, now in question.
It is certain that this diversity in "the law of the land" between public defaulters and ordinary debtors was understood iii
this country, and entered into the legislation of the colonies and
provinces, and more especially of the States, after the declaration of independence aiid before the formation of the constitu
tion of the United States. Not only was the process of distress
in nearly or quite universal use for the collection of taxes, but
what was generally termed a warrant of distress, running against
the body, goods, and chattels of defaulting receivers of public
money, was issued to some public officer, to whom was com-

mitted the power to ascertain the amount of the default, and by
such warrant proceed to collect it. Without a wearisome repetition of details, it will be sufficient to give one section from the
Massachusetts act of 1786: "That if any constable or collector,
to whom any tax or assessment shall be committed to collect,
shall be remiss and negligent of his duty, in not levying and paying unto the treasurer and receiver-general such sum or sums of
money as lie shall from time to time have received, and as ought
by him to have been paid within the respective time set and limited by the assessor's warrant, pursuant to law, the treasurer and
receiver-general is hereby empowered, after the expiration of the
time so set, by warrant under his hand and seal, directed to the
sheriff or his deputy, to cause such sum and sums of money to be
levied by distress and sale of such deficient constable or collector's estate, real and personal, returning the overplus, if any there
be; and, for want of such estate, to take the body of such constable or collector, and imprison him until he shall pay the same ;
which warrant the sheriff or his deputy is hereby empowered
and required to execute accordingly." Then follows anothei
provision, that if the deficient sum shall not be made by the first
warrant, another shall issue against the town ; and if its proper
authorities shall fail to take the prescribed means to raise and
pay the same, a like warrant of distress shall go against the
estates and bodies of the assessors of such town. Laws of
Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 266. Provisions not distinguishable
from these in principle may be found in the acts of Connecticut.

Penn. 13 ;) of South Carolina, 1788, (5 Stats.. of S. C. 55;) New

of the United States, other States have passed similar laws.
See 7 L6uis. An. R. 192. Congress, from an early period, and
in repeated instances, has legislated in a similar manner. By
the fifteenth section of the "Act to lay and collect a direct tax
within the United States," of July 14, 1798, the supervisor of
each district was authorized and required to issue a warrant of
distress against any delinquent collector and his sureties, to be
levied upon the goods and chattels, and for want thereof upon
the body of such collector ; and, failing of satisfaction thereby,
upon the goods and chattels of the sureties. 1 Stats. at Large,
602. And again, in 1813, (3 Stats. at Large, 33, § 28,) and
1815, (3 Stats. at Large, 177, § 33,) the comptroller of the treasury was empowered to issue a similar Warrant against collectors
of the customs and their sureties. This legislative construction
of the constitution,, commencing so early in the government,

SUPREME COURT.
Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co

when the first occasion for this manner of proceeding arose, con
tinued throughout its existence, and repeatedly acted on by the
judiciary and the executive, is entitled to no inconsiderable
weight upon the question whether the proceeding adopted by it
was "due process of law." Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 621;
United States v. Nourse, 9 Pet. 8; Randolph's case, 2 Brock.
447 ; Nourse's case, 4 Cranch, 0. 0. R. 151; Bullock's case,
(cited 6 Pet. 485, note.)
Tested by the common and statute law of England prior to
the emigration of our ancestors, and by the laws of many of the
States at the time of the adoption of this amendment, the proceedings authorized by the act of 1820 cannot be denied to be
due process of law, when applied to the ascertainment and recovery of balances due to the government from a collector of
customs, unless there exists in the constitution some other provision which restrains congress from authorizing such proceedings. For, though "due process of law" generally implies and
includes actor, reus, judex, regular allegations, opportunity to
answer, and a trial according to some settled course of judicial
proceedings, (2 Inst. 47, 50; Hoke v. Henderson, 4 Dev. N. 0.
Rep. 15; Taylor v. Porter, 4 Hill, 146; Van Zandt v. Waddel,
2 Yerger, 260 ; State Bank v. Cooper, Ibid. 599; Jones's Heirs
v. Perry, 10 Ibid. 59; Greene v. Briggs, 1 Curtis, 311,) yet, this
is not universally true. There may be, and we have seen that
there are cases, under the law of England after Llfagna Charta,
and as it was brought to this country and acted on here, in
which process, in its nature final, issues against the body, lands,
and goods of certain public debtors without any such trial ; and
this brings us to the question, whether those provisions of the
constitution which relate to the judicial power are incompatible
with these proceedings ?
That the auditing of the accounts of a receiver of public
moneys may be, in an enlarged sense, a judicial act, must be
admitted. So are all those administrative duties the performance of which involves an inquiry into the existence of facts
and the application to them of rules of law. In this sense the
act of the President in calling out the militia under the act of
1795, 12 Wheat. 19, or of a commissioner who makes a certificate for the extradition of a criminal, under a treaty, is judicial.
But it is not sufficient to bring such matters under the judicial
power, that they involve the exercise of judgment upon law and
fact. United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40. It is necessary to
go further, and show not only that the adjustment of the balances
due from accounting officers may be, but from their nature must
be, controversies to which the United States is a party, within
the meaning of the second section of the third article of the

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

281

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

constitution. We do not doubt the power of congress to provide by law that such a question shall form the subject-matter
of a suit in which the judicial power can be exerted. The act
of 1820 makes such a provision for reviewing the decision of
the accounting officers of the treasury. But, until reviewed, it
is final and binding; and the question is, whether its subjectmatter is necessarily, and without regard to the consent of
congress, a judicial controversy. And we are of opinion it is
not.
Among the legislative powers of congress are the powers "to
lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the
debts, and provide for the common defence and welfare of the
United States, to raise and support armies; to provide and
maintain a navy, and to make all laws which may be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution those powers." What
officers should be appointed to collect the revenue thus authorized to be raised, and to disburse it in payment of the debts of
the United States; what duties should be required of them;
when and how, and to whom they should account, and what
security they should furnish, and to what remedies they should
be subjected to enforce the proper discharge of their duties, congress was to determine. In the exercise of their powers, they
have required collectors of customs to be appointed; made it incumbent on them to account, from time to time, with certain
officers of the treasury department, and to furnish sureties, by
bond, for the payment of all balances of the public money which
may become due from them. And by the act of 1820, now in
question, they have undertaken to provide summary means to
compel these officers - and in case of their default, their sureties- to pay such'balances of the public money as may be in their
bands.
The power to collect and disburse revenue, and to make all
laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying that power
into effect, includes all known and appropriate means of effectually collecting and disbursing that revenue, unless some such
means should be forbidden in some other part of the constitution. The power has not been exhausted by the receipt of the
money by the collector. Its purpose is to raise money and use
it in payment of the debts of the government; and, whoever may
have possession of the public money, until it is actually disbursed,
the power to use those known and appropriate means to secure
its due application continues.
As we have already shown, the means provided by the act of
1820 do not differ in principle from those employed in England
from remote antiquity - and in many of the States, so far as we
know without objection - for this purpose, at the time the con24 *

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

stitution was formed. It may be added, that probably there
are few governments which do or can permit their claims for
public taxes, either on, the citizen or the officer employed for
their collection or disbursement, to become subjects of judicial
controversy, according to the course of the law of the land.
ImperativQ necessity has forced a distinction between such
claims and all others, which has sometimes been carried out by
summary methods of proceeding, and sometimes by systems of
fines and penalties, but always in some way observed and
yielded to.
It is true that in England all these proceedings were had in
what is denominated the court of exchequer, in which Lord
Coke says, 4 Inst. 115, the barons are the sovereign auditors of
the kingdom. But the barons exercise in person no judicial
power in auditing accounts, and it is necessary to remember that
the exchequer includes two distinct organizations, one of which
has charge of the revenues of the crown, and the other has long
been in fact, and now is for all purposes, one of the judicial
courts of the kingdom, whose proceedings are and have been
as distinct, in most respects, from those of the revenue side of
the exchequer, as the proceedings of the circuit court of this
district are from those of the treasury; and it would be an unwarrantable assumption to conclude that, because the accounts
of receivers of revenue were settled in what was denominated the
court of exchequer, they were judicial controversies between the
king and his subjects, according to the ordinary course of the
common law or equity. The fact, as we have already seen, was
otherwise.
It was strongly urged by the plaintiff's counsel, that though
the government might have the rightful power to provide a
summary remedy for the recovery of its public dues, aside from
any exercise of the judicial power, yet it had not done so in this
instance. That it had enabled the debtor to apply to the judicial
power, and having thus brought the subject-matter under its cognizance, it was not for the government to say that the subjectmatter was not within the judicial power. That if it were not in
its nature a judicial controversy, congress could not make it
such, nor give jurisdiction over it to the district courts. In
short, the argument is, that if this were not, in its nature, a judicial controversy, congress could not have conferred on the district court power to determine it upon a bill filed by the collector.
If it be such a controversy, then it is subject to the judicial power
alone; and the fact that congress has enabled the district court
to pass upon it, is conclusive evidence that it is a judicial controversy.
We cannot admit the correctness of the last position. If we

were of opinion that this subject-matter cannot be the subject of
a judicial controversy, and that, consequently, it cannot be made
a subject of judicial cognizance, the consequence would be, that
the attempt to bring it under the jurisdiction of a court of the
United States would be ineffectual. But the previous proceedings of the executive department would not necessarily be affectet
thereby. They might be final, instead of being subject to judicial review.
But the argument leaves out of view an essential element in
the case, and also assumes something which cannot be admitted.
It assumes that the entire subject-matter is or is not, in every
mode of presentation, a judicial controversy, essentially and in
its own nature, aside from the will of congress to permit it to
be so; and it leaves out of view the fact that the United States
is a party.
It is necessary to take into view some settled rules.
Though, generally, both public and private wrongs are redressed through judicial action, there are more summary extrajudicial remedies for both. An instance of extrajudicial redress
of a private wrong is, the recapture of goods by their lawful
owner; of a public wrong, by a private person, is the abatement
of a public nuisance; and the recovery of public dues by a
summary process of distress, issued by some public officer
authorized by law, is an instance of redress of a particular kind
of public wrong, by the act of the public through its authorized
agents. There is, however, an important distinction between
these. Though a private person may retake his property, or
abate a nuisance, lie is directly responsible for his acts to the
proper judicial tribunals. His authority to do these acts depends
not merely on the law, but upon the existence of such facts as
are, in point of law, sufficient to constitute that authority; and
he may be required, by an action at law, to prove those facts;
but a public agent, who acts pursuant to the command of a
legal precept, can justify his act by the production of such precept. He cannot be made responsible in a judicial tribunal for
obeying the lawful command of the government; and the government itself, which gave the command, cannot be sued without
its own consent.
At the same time there can be no doubt that the mere question, whether a collector of the customs is indebted to the United
States, may be one of judicial cognizance. It is competent for
the United States to sue any of its debtors in a court of law.
It is equally clear that the United States may consent to be
sued, and may yield this consent upon such terms and under
such restrictions as it may think just. Though both the marshal
.nd the government are exempt from suit, for anything done by

284

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

the former in obedience to legal process, still, congress may provide by law, that both, or either, shall, in a particular class of
cases, and under such restrictions as they may think proper to
impose, come into a court of law or equity and abide by its determination. The United States may thus place the government
upon the same ground which is occupied by private persons who
proceed to take extrajudicial remedies for their wrongs, and they
may do so to such extent, and with such restrictions, as may be
thought fit.
When, therefore, the act of 1820 enacts, that after the levy
of the distress warrant has been begun, the collector may bring
before a district court the question, whether he is indebted as
recited in the warrant, it simply waives a privilege which belongs
to the government, and consents to make the legality of its
future proceedings dependent on the judgment of the court; as
we have already stated in case of a private person, every fact
upon which the legality of the extrajudicial remedy depends may
be drawn in question by a suit against him. The United States
consents that this fact of indebtedness may be drawn in question
by a suit against them. Though they might have withheld their
consent, we think that, by granting it, nothing which may not be
a subject of judicial cognizance is brought before the court.
To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject, we think it
proper to state that we do not consider congress can either withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature,
is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty; nor, on the other hand, can it bring under the judicial
power a matter which, from its nature, is not a subject for judicial determination. At the same time there ate matters, involving public rights, which may be presented in such form that
the judicial power is capable of acting on them, and which are
susceptible of judicial determination, but which congress may
or may not bring within the cognizance of the courts of the
United States, as it may deem proper. Equitable claims to land
by the inhabitants of ceded territories form a striking instance
of such a class of cases; and as it depends upon the will of
congress whether a remedy in the courts shall be allowed at all,
in such cases, they may regulate it and prescribe such rules of
determination as they may think just and needful. Thus it has
been repeatedly d~eided in this class of cases, that upon their
trial the acts of executive officers, done under the authority of
congress, were conclusive, either upon particular facts involved
in the inquiry or upon the whole title. Foley v. Harrison, 15
How. 433 ; Burgess v. Gray, 16 How. 48;
v. The Minnesota Mlining Company at the present term.
It is true, also, that even in a suit between private persons to
-

DECEMBER

TERM, 1855.

285

Murray's Lessee et al. v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co.

try a question of private right, the action of the executive- polver,
upon a matter committed to its determination by the constitution
and laws, is conclusive. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1; Doe v.
Braden, 16 How. 635.
To apply these principles to the case before us, we say that,
though a suit may be brought against the marshal for seizing
property under such a warrant of distress, and he may be put
to show his justification ; yet the action of the executive power
in issuing the warrant, pursuant to the act of 1820, passed under
the powers to collect and disburse the revenue granted by the
constitution, is conclusive evidence of the facts recited in it,
and of the authority to make the levy; that though no suit can
be brought against the United States without the consent of
congress, yet congress may consent to have a suit brought, to
try the question whether the collector be indebted, that being a
subject capable of judicial determination, and may empower a
court to act on that determination, and restrain the levy of the
warrant of distress within the limits of the debt judicially found
to exist.
It was further urged that, by thus subjecting the proceeding
to the determination of a court, it did conclusively appear that
there was no such necessity for a summary remedy, by the action
of the executive power, as was essential to enable congress to
authorize this mode of proceeding.
But it seems to us that the just inference from the entire law
is, that there was such a necessity .for the warrant and the commencement of the levy, but not for its completion, if the collector should interpose, and file his bill and give security. The
provision that he may file his bill and give security, and thus
arrest the summary proceedings, only proves that congress
thought it not necessary to pursue them, after such security
should be given, until a decision should be made by the court.
It has no tendency to prove they were not, in the judgment of
congress, of the highest necessity under all other circumstances;
and of this necessity congress alone is the judge.
The remaining objection to this warrant is, that it was issued
without the support of an oath or affirmation, and so was forbidden by the fourth article of the amendments of the constitution. But this article has no reference to civil proceedings fbr
the recovery of debts, of which a search warrant is not made
part. The process, in this case, is termed, in the act of congress, a warrant of distress. The name bestowed upon it cannot affect its constitutional validity. In substance, it is an
extent authorizing a levy for the satisfaction of a debt ; and as
no other authority is conferred, to make searches or seizures,
than is ordinarily embraced in every execution issued upon a

recognizance, or a stipulation in the admiralty, we are of opinion
it was not invalid for this cause.
Some objection was made to the proceedings of the marslal
under the warrant, because he did not levy on certain shares of
corporate stock belonging to Swartwout, and because it does
not appear, by the return of the warrant, that he had not goods
and chattels wherewith to satisfy the exigency of the warrant.
In respect to the corporate stocks, they do not appear to have
been goods or chattels, subject to such levy at the time it was
made; and the return of the marshal, that he had levied on the
lands by virtue of the warrant, is, at least, primet facie evidence
that his levy was not irregular, by reason of the existence of
goods and chattels of the collector subject to his process.
The third question is, therefore, to be answered in the affirmative.
This renders the other questions proposed immaterial, and no
answer need be returned thereto.
The other two cases, - John Den, ex dem. James B. Murray
et al. v. The Hoboken Land and Improvement Company. And
John Den, ex dem. William P. Rathbone et al v. Rutsen Suckley
et al., are disposed of by this opinion, the same questions having
been certified therein.

WILLIAx D. NUTT, EXECUTOR OF ALEXANDER HUNTER,
CEASED, PLAINTIFP IN ERROR, V. PHILIP H. MINOR.

DE-

Where a case is brought up to this court upon an alleged error in a demurrer to evidence, inasmuch as the prayer to the court below was, that there wa no evidence
from which the jury could infer a certain promise; and this court is of opinion that
the court below judged rightly in thinking that there was such evidence, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.

THIS case was brought up by-writ of error from the circuit
court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden
in and for the county of Washington.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by Mr. Davis and L11r. Bradley, for the plaintiff in error, and by A3r. Badger and 111r. Lawrence, for the defendant.
Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
Minor sued Nutt as executor of Alexander Hunter, and sought
to recover on a quantum meruit for services rendered as clerk for
Hunter in the marshal's office for fourteen and a half years.
The defence is, that Minor entered on the service under a
special agreement to receive four hundred dollars a year.
