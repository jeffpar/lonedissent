thereupon prayed the opinion of the court, that by virtue of the said
judgment and attachntent and condefonation by him given in evidence,
a legal estate was vested in tjse said Littleton Waters in the V~id tract
of land called lBroxin's Adventure. But the court were of opinion, and
so directed the jury, that the said Littleton Waters did not acquire a
legal estate in the said land by virtue of the saidjudgment, attachment
and condimnation.
The 4th bill of, exceptions stated the same facts, and further that
the'defendant rind the ht of assembly passed at Novmes ber session,
1767, c. 119. and prayed the opinion of the cour4tsat by virtue of that
act the right of the state was so fir vested'in the -persons possessing

that the plaintiff could not in virtue of his said warrant, certificate and
patent haveany rithtor title to the Wid land ; or, if any, then no more
than the proportion or compensation to which a discoverer of confiscated propertyis entitled. But the court were of opinion that the
right of the plaintiff to Brown's Adventure attached upon his obtaining
the var,rant of escheat, and- that his right was saved and protected by
'he proviso in the 2d lectidn of thesaid act of Nqvember, 1797, c. 119.
And that the grant transferred to him the interest The state had in the
land called "( 'Th Discve-" from the time of his obtention of his said
warrant of escheat.
The 54th bill of exceptions states the same fadts, whereupon the
defendAut prayed the opinion of the court; and their direction to the
jury, that if the )varrant of escheat which issued in this case, issued
without'authority of law,. -then the warranty contained in the act of
November, 1781, o. 20. ยง 8 did not operate to give title to the plaitiw,

two-thirds of the value of the saicLland, being what the plaintiff was
liable to pay for the same as confiscated British property; and that

The 6th bill of' exceptions also stated the same facts, and that the
defendant thereupon praved the court to direct the jury that if the
said ti'act of land called Brawn's Adventure belonged to a British subJect at the time of passing the act for confiscating British property in
the state of Maryland, anti if no actual possession had been taken

1794, took effect, the plaintiff could make no title.thereto by his said
warrant, certificate and pateit.
But the court refused to give that direction to thd jury, being of
opinion, that the state.of Maryland, by "their commissioners, was in
possessior of all British property within the limits of the siid state,
under and by virtu6 f the act of confiscation, Octebpr,-1780, c. 45.
ind the act of the same session, a. 49. to 4ppoint commissioners &o.
And that the possession 6f the said land was in the state of Maland

British subject could hold land in the state of Maryland-o the 19th ofNovember, 1794, the time when the tfeaty was entered into betwcpn
the United States and Great Britain.
The 7th bill of excqptiois, in .ddftion tothe fact before mentioned,
stated, that the defendant offered eyidence that the heirs of Rawlins
were still living in-Maryland. That R wlins, in the year 1741, made.
his will and devised Brown's Adventure by name to some of hi'childrien. rhat: the heirs of Littleton NVaters are still living in Maryland.
That the Baltimore company, under -whnm the defendant claims, have

be signed, sealed and .dlivered by some other friend
of Welsh, which was 'not done,, and so the said
writing is void as to him the said MossTo this plea the plaintiffs demurred specially;
1st. Because a bond cannot be delivered to the
obligee himself as an escrow; 2d. Because the plea
does not state by what other, friend of Welsh it
was to have been executed; 3d. Because it did not
state by whom the execution of the bbnd, by that
other friend wag to have been procured, leaving it uncertain whether the condition upon which
it was to beconie the deed of Moss was to be
performed by him, or by Riddle, or by Welsh; 4.
Because the plea is repugnant, ificonsistent and
informal. The second plea, after protesting as in
the.first plea, avers, that Riddle came to the defendant'an'd asked him whether Welsh had not aipplied
to him, -Moss, to be his security for a debt due to
Riddle & Co.; to which Moss replied he had
told Welsh- he would not be security alone, but would
join Welsh and some other friend of his as security
or the debt, whereupon Riddle represented that
the greatest confidence was placed, in Welsh; that
saesslon,
c. 49. to appoint commissioners, subject to the right ofredcmptio in the mortgagor and his heirs, and that the British treaty cannot
operate to affect the plaintffPs right to recover in this ejectment, and
refused to give the direction prayed.
The 9th bill of exeeptions, in addition to the same facts, states, that
thedefendantofferedin evidence a lease and release from Littletorn
, aters to Benjamin Tasker and others, dated June '20, and 21, 1738,
of so much of Bi'fwn's Adventure as, qecording to a valuation upon

sterling, and thereupon prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if
they find the facts as stated by the defendant, the deeds of lease and
release from Waters to Tasker and others conveyed a legal title in the
lands therein mentinned; and that if a legal title did nnt pass, then the
jury may atid
ought to presumea title in the said Tasker and others to
the whole of an undivided 386 acres of land, being an undivided part
of the 870 acres of land mortgaged to Jonathan Scarth, called Brmitw's
Adventure. But the court kcused.to give the direction prayed.
The 10th bill of exceptions states, that upon the same facts the defendant prayed the court to direct thejury that as toall that part of
Brown's Adventure cuanhained in the deed frnm "Watersto Tusker and
others, under whom the defendant claims, the patant granted to the
plaintiff does not give him a title therrtsa, or enable him to recoverthe

%he.partnershlipof Riddle & Co. was- about to be
dissolved; that Riddle would take care to keep that
piper, if- it was executed, in his dividend of the
debts; that Welsh and Moss might sign the bond at
that time, and some oth6r person might sign it after-

wards- that in regard to the-debt he would look only
to Welsh, ind would alo -give Welsh a credit for
goods, when he, Riddle, should open and commence

business on his private and individual account. The,
plea further avers, that Moss being induced by that
representation and'promise, did signseal and deliver
the writing, upon-condition that some other friend
of .the said Welsh should also sign, seal and deliver'
the same, .nd not otherwise; which was never
done. That Riddle did afterwards carry on trade
and -.merchandise, on his own separate and individual account, but never afterwards credited Welsh
with any goods- or merchandise; "and so the said
writing made, and executed as. aforesaid is void as
tfo him the said Robert Moss."
To this plea the plaintiff also demurred speoially
for the' causes stated in the first demurrer; and
further, because the plea is multifarious, argumentative, and offers to put in issue a number of matters
unconnected with the defence set up, and immaterial
in themselves.
The court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs
upon both demurrers.
Before the judgment was entered by the clerk, the
defendant below prayed leave to amend his first plya,
by striking out the words "delivered to Joseph Riddle, one of the plaintiffs in this cause," and inserting,
in lieu thereof the words " placed it" the hands of
Joseph Riddle, one of the plaintiffs in: tlijs cause."
But the court refused leave to make the amendmeat. To which refusal the defendant excepted.
Afterwards, and after the court had pronounced
judgment in the cause, the defendant moved the
court for leave to file an amended plea, which was in
