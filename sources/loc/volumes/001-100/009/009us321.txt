E. . Lee, contra, contended, "that it was to be
inferred from the case of Lloyd v. Alexander, azzte,
Vol. 1. p. 365. that if the defendant appears wilihi
the thty days, the court will;hear the case; or they
Will hear- the case' after the expiration of the thirty
days, even if the party does not appear.
"oungs. The 22d section of the judiciary act,

Vol. 1. p. 62. requires, that the defendant- in error.

should have thirty days' notice by the service of the
-citation.

The c*itation is to appear on the first,day of the.
term, consequently thirty days' notice must be by
service .ofthe citation-thirty days before the first day
of the court.
Tnn. COURT refused to takIe up the case without.
consent, although thirty days had. then (MArch 9,
when the cause was" called for hearing) elapsed
since the.service of the citation; and observed, that
the case of Lloyd v. Alexander only decided that the
court will not take up the ca.se until thirty days have
expired since the service of the citation; but t did
not decide that the'court would then take it-up without consent.
