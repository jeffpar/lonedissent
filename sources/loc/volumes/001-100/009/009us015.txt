To this surrejoinder the defendants demurred,
hand assigned for cause of demurrer, that'" the sur-

rejoinder is a -departurein this, that it is no answer
to the defendants' rejoinder."

Upon joinder in demurrer, the court below gave
jtidgment for the- plaintiff.
A'bilf of exceptions stated, that on the day on
which;the-cause was called for trial, the court per-

mitted the plaintiff to withdraw his gehdeal replication to the plei of the statute of limitations, and' to
'file the above pecialreplication. And that after the

court had givinjudgment upon the demurrer, it refused to permit the defendants to withdraw th.ir de-

murrer, and their rejoinder, and'to file a general rejoinder to the plaintiff's replication.

2 oungis for the- plaintiffs in error.
1. The plaintiff below ought not to have been permitted to withdraw his general replication, and to.re-

ply sp.ecially.
LIVINGsTo0,

J. Is that a proper subject for a

writ'of error?

r"oun.&s. Thera are other points; but I suppose
it is good. ground- for a writ of error. - It creates
delay ; and although amendments may be matter of
discredon with the couit, yet the court is bound to
exercise its discretion soundly and legally; it is a
disfection which this court will control.
2. The exception in the statute of limitations in,
far our of merchants' accounts, applies 'only to ac-

the last item shall draw all the.rest out of the statute.
But if all dealings between the parties have ceased
for more than five years -next before the commencement of the suit, the whole accouni'isjbarred.
An account whith has ceased to run is an., account
closed. An account closed is an account stated; and
it is expressly decided that an account stated is not
excepted from. the general operation of- the statute.
Besides, the exception of the statute is only in favour of actions of account, and not actions of assumpsit. 2 Ves. 400. Welford. v. Liddel. 4 Mlod.

'The replication is repugnant to the declaration;
for money due for the -hire of a negro cannot be
" money due on an account current of trade-andmlerchandise."
The declarationought to have stated the moqey.to
be due upon such an account.
3."The court below ought to have permitted the
defendant to withdraw his demurre and his rejoinder, and rejoin gencrally to the replication.

not be right in .all cases, after the party had taken
issue upon the law, and it has been decided against
him, to suffer him also to take issue upon the fact.
If it be permitted, it is a matter of great indulgence.
There is no ground for the objection taken to the
declaration in this case, that it ought to have averred
that the money was due on an account concerning
the trade of merchandise.
A declaration need not set forth the circumstances which take the case out of the statute of limitations.
roun.As cited 6 T. R. 691. Holt v. Scholefteld,
to show that when general-damages are given, if there
be one bad count in the declaration, the court will
arrest the judgment.
MARSHALL, Ch. J. But by the statute of jeofails in Virginia, under whose laws this case was
tried, the judgment shall be rendered for the pl intiff, upon a general verdict, if there be one good
count in the declaration.

On a subsequent day
MARSHALL,

Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the

court,
That the exception in the statute applied to actions
of assumpsit, as well as to actions of account. That
it extended to all accounts current which concern
the trade of merchandise between merchant and
