upon the property of American "itizens, which is

property was neutral or belfigerent.

SUPREME COUT'

The 5th plea', insubstance y.vas, that it has'always
:o: been, and is the rual and practice of the defendants,
to make an insurance upon a vessel bfybnd
her reasopable and just value accoi:ding to-the representation and description.given of her, especially as
t6'her age, tonnage'and equiplnent, which rule and
practice were well known) to the contracting parties
at the time of the contract, at which time the plaintiff
proposed to the defendants that the value o'the vessel should be agreed in the policy to be ten thousand
dollars; and that at the time of executing the policy, th6 plaintiff, to in'duce-the defendants to execute
it, thereby, insuring to the value of 8,000 dollars
upon the" vessel, represented that she was "aboit
250 tons burthen," "and from six to seven years old."
That the defendants, ,ncqnsequence of that representat;on, and placing full faith and credit therein, executed the policy. 'I hat the representation was untrue in this, that the vessel Vas not of two hundred
and fifty tons burthen, but less than one hundred and
sixty:-fve tons burthen and was not fromsix to seven
years old at the time of the representation, but much
c Ider, viz. more than eight and a half years old.
"hat the vessel was not of the value of eight thousand dollars, but of the value of 3,000 dollars otily'.
That the misrepresentation respecting the .age and,
tonnage of the vessel' induced the defendants to execute the policy, whereby the value was agreed. to be
tin thousand dollars, and whereby iisurance wag
made td the amount of 8,000 thousand dollars ; "1and
-so the saiddeed is void as to them; and this they are
ready to verify."

Snever

To this plea also there was a demurrer, and the
following causes werestated:
i. Because the plea does not aver the ,misretresentation to be material.
2. Because it is nQt alleged' to have been fraudIulently made.
3. Because the matter of the plea is not sufficieht
to annul or make void the policy.'

4. Because the misrepresentation alleged is not of
a definite fact; -but that the vessel was Qf'about 27i

5. .Becapse the plea is double in this, that.it putt
in issue the custom of the defendants, the representation touching the vessel, the age, the 'tonnage- and
the value of the vessel.
6. Because the defendants are estopped by the policy from averring that the vessel was of less value
than 10,000 dollars.
The 6th plea was like the 5th, except that the aver.
ment'respecting the rule and practice of the defend-ants vas omitted, and thdt it contained an averment
that the difference between the" tru.e and the repre=
sented age and tonnage 9f'the vessel "'was material

set forth; and so the policy was void as to them.
To this plea the'plintiff, protesting that the vessel
WÂ¢ai seaworthy,'and that he'did not knowingly and
fraudulently statb any misrepresentation, and admitting that the vessel was of less tihaii 165 tons burthen, and was eight and a half. years old, replied,'
that 'the difference bi-tween the true %.and the represented"age ind tonnage of the vessel, was nbt
material iMregardto the seaworthiness of the vessel,
and her ibility, 'to perform the Oydfge insunred, ",and
did not increase the proballity of loss by means of
any o" the risks insurbd against, but wasaltogether'
immaterial in regard' to those risks.
The 'rejoinder -of the 'defendants set forth their
rdle "indpractice as stated in -the -5th plea; and
averred that the -misrepresentation induced and deceived the defendants into the'lagreement. as to the
value of the vessel, and ds to the sum insured, and
thht the sum insured was more than double the
valu'e of th&vessel; and so the defendants say. that
the difference between the true and the represented
age and tonnage of the vessel was material.

The 7th plea was, in substance, "that the vessel

law, to set it aside,

It is true that any fraud in the execution of an

&c. But this plea show. no fraud, nor unlawful
consideration. - It relies merely upon fa. mistake
which goes only to -a part-of the subject matter of
the contract.
2. The misrepresentation set foith in'this plea
would not be sufficient to vacate the policy, eveff if it
-were a simple contract.. The misrepresentation
must relate to the risk, afntbe material as it regards

lea concludes by saying that the repre0

sentation was material in regard to the contract of

insurance.
This averment is difficult to be understood. It
-might mean material as it rekArded the amount
insured, 9r '.material as it regarded the risk. If
issue had been taken. upon this averment, the julry
-might have decided that the representation-was ma.terial as. it regarded the amount insured; and .upon
that ground the cause -might have been lost. If
-the plaintiff had demurred to it, it might have been
an admission that. it was material to the rl'k. If
the averment had been that it was material as to the
amount insured, we should have demurred; if it
had been ,that it was material to the risk, we should
have taken issue.
In this uncertainty it was necessary for-the plaintiff to reply tpecially; tendering an issue as to the
materiality of the represeritation in regard to the
risk of tbe..voyage.' This issue tih defendants refused to join, and, have thereby -explained their
averrhent to be that the representation was material,
not to the risk, but to the amount insured. In this
point of view it is bad not only for the reasons
alleged against the 5th plea, but because it neither
shows nor avers the representation to be material in
regard to the risk.
No falsehood or misrepresentation, not increasing
the risk, is material. No misrepresentation touching the ability of the vessel to' perform the voyage
cati be material if she is 'sea'wortfy. The law does
not notice grades of. seaworthiness; and with regard to this point her age and tonnage were perfectly immaterial: and it was equally immaterial:as
to the value,' because the value was conclusively
fixed in the policy.'

amounts to a fraud in law, and that fradd,will vacate every kind 6f instrument; and that in all cases
6f insurance any misrepresentation material to the
contract is fatal.
It is because it is a valuedp.olicy, that the misrepresentation'as to the age aid tonnage bec~nme material
to ,the contract. It was a misrepresentation .of
those facts upon which a judgment was to be formed,
of the value of the vessel. The "defendatits never
would have agreed to fix that v~dlue, unless they hid
believed the representation of the. plaintiff :as to
those facts. The misrepresentation induced the
defendants to make a"contract which they would
not otherwise -haye made. ' It is unnecessary that
the plaintiff should have known that .hewas~misrepresenting the facts.
, He"uindertook to represent the" facts, and by go
doing must take the risk of their truth, and, the
consequences. of their falsehood.
The mater;aity was a. question for the'.jury.

fact, the court m-y leave the whole to the jury.
The pleais not double. A misrfepreseptation may
be in a.variety.of particulars nece ssary for the formation of a correct judgment as to the value.
.The defendants are not* "estopped by their dIejo
from alleging facts which show the mistake, or misrepresentation upon'which the instrument was. pred icated; because if the deed be void-the estoppel cannot exist.
If the goods of an enemy be'insuied as the goQds
of an ally,%the policy is void. I he only question on
this point, is,whether the vessel was insured as an
American, vessel.

SUPREME COURT U. S

The eighth plea is also bad. The defendants acknowledge, under seal, to have received a consideration of 17 1-2 per cent. for the insurance they made,
which it appears was secured by a note, the amount
of Which was to be deducted from the sum to be
paid for a loss, if any happened. On the face of
the instrument, then, a valid consideration, if that
be necessary, is stated, and if thie note be never
paid it cannot Vacate the contract, or be 'relied
on as a defence to an action on it. This court
knows not why a court of equity has been applied
to fttr an injunction. Its proceedings, therefore,
can have no influence on the present Suit, for notwithstanding its interposition in the way mentioned
in this plea, the defendants cannot be deprived of
the right they 'hav reserved of deducting the
amount of premium from whatever sum they. may
have to pay for the loss that has occurred.
Without deciding whether a material misrepresentation, not fraudulent, can be pleaded in avoidance of it sealed instrument, the court thinks there
is no fact digcdosed by either the fifth or sixth plea,
which could vacate an insurance were it only a sim,ple contract. In no part of the 5th plea is the misrepresentation alleged to be material. - It is only to
be. inferred that it had some influence (but to what
degree does not appear) in prevailing on the defendants' to agree to so high a vatuadon. It will hardly, however, be insisted, that every over-valuation,
however' inconsiderable, or however innocently produced, will annul a contraqt of this nature. It
would seem more reasonable, to let mistakes of this
kind (if they are to have any operation at all) re*
gulate the -extent of recovery, and not deprive the
party of his 'whole indemnity: for if an extravagant
valuation be made, an underwriter cannot reasonably ask to be .relieved bdyond the excess complained of. The allegation 'that the vessel was worth,
when insured, only 3,000 dollars, is also very unimportant, it being nowhere stated that the plaintiff
represented her to be worth more, .but only proposed that her, value in the policy should be agreed

a difference of ayear or two in thq'age,'andof fifty

6th plea reversed; and judgment on that plea be

JOHNSON, J. The difficulties in this case arise
partly from the pleadings, and partly from the case
presented by the pleadings.'

This policy, having been effected by a corporation under it-, corporate, seal, has been considered
as imposing an obligation'on the insured to bring
covenant instead of assumpsit, as is usual on such
contracts.
Thus the defendants haye been obliged to plead
specially; and the cause comes up on demurrer,
which, of course; admits the case as made up on the
pleadings.
Whether there, is sufficient matter well pleaded
why the plaintiff ought not-to recover? is therefore
the question before us.
I am of opinion that there is. I cannot for a moment suffer the sealing of the policy, or the form of
the actibn, to impose any restriction upon the latitude of defence applicable to'the contract of insurance. Stich a doctrine would be fatal to every incorporated insurance company. -I therefore maintain, that, in the action of covenant on a policy of
insirance, every defence may.be taken advantage of,
in pleading, that' could be introduced, in' evitence,
before a jary. -It is an exqeedingly .inconvenient
form of action for trying the. merits of questions
arising out of this species of contract, "ind:I feel
4Oisposed, if possible, to diminish the inevitable dif'ficulties, and the intricate and volumbinous pleadings,
which must grow out'of this form of action, and to
admit every facility which the ,rulep'of pleading will
'possibly sanction'.
There are eight pleas filed to the present, action.

each of these several pleas, although, perhaps, on M1

some of them, for reasons not altogether the same
with those by which they were influenced; but I shall
confine my observations solely to the sixth plea, as
that disposes of the case finally, if decided for the
defendants, and has been the principalmsubject of the
argument before- this court.
,The substance of this plea is-, that the plainiiff
misrepresented the age and tonnage -of the veseI,whereby the defendants were induced to insure to a
higher.amount than they otherwise should; and concludes with averring, that the difference between the
true age and tonnage of the vessel, .and the represented age and tonnage, was material iii regard to
the contract of insurance.
The plaintiff replies that this misrepresentation
was ifimaterial in regard to the seaworthiness.of the
vessel; her abiloty to perform the voyage, and the
othdr risks insured against.
To me it appears that -the plea presents the true
turning point of the case, and that the replication
draws towards questions" very diiTerent from that
which ought fi control 'our decisions.
It is not on the doctrine 'of seawuothinesi that a
misrepresentation is held to vitiate the policy, because the insured -is always held to guaranty the
sufficiency of his vessel to perform the voyage insured. Nor is it an evident and necessary increase
.of the risk; but it is presenting such false lights to
the insurer, as induce him *to enter into a contract
materially different from that whicF he supposes he
is entering into. It is a rule of lai introduced to
protect underwriters from those innumerable frauds
which are practised upon -them in, a contract which
must of necessity be regulated almost-wholly, by the.
information derived from the insured. I do not lair so much stress upon the misrepreVol. V.

mium would induce him to insure'double that
amount upon' the same bottom. I am aware of--a.
very considerable diffic,ulty arising out of this case,.
viz. how we-are to estimate the degree of misrepresentation with r$gard to tonnage which shall vitiate
a policy? but it is a difficulty arising out of the
node in which. we are drawn into a decision on the
case, rather than. out of the case itself.
If this question had been brought before a jury
the difficulty would have vanished; but. shall the
party' lose the benefit of this defence because the
pleadings have assuimed such a shape as to force the
court into a decision upon the point without a jury ?
I am of opinion that he ought not, if it can be
avoided; an extreme case maIay be supposed in which
the misrepresentation may be very inconsiderable,
as df a single ton for instance; but, on the other hand,
We may, suppose'an extreme case of a misrepresentation to the highest possible number of tons burden,
say 1,000 tons; will it be said that,.in the latter case,
the mitrepresentation wduld not avoid the policy ?
From these considerations it seems to result that
the c9urt is driven to the necessity, of deciding this
-case, upon its intrinsic merits, and reserving its oplmon upon successive cases as they shall occur. This
necessity it forced upon us by the alternativ6 eitherto decide that no misrepresentation, however gios

some statutory provision may be made, which will
