judgment was taken to the Supreme Court of the State.
This was clearly the appropriate remedy for the correction
of the errors of the District Court, if there were any. The
action of the District Court in refusing the removal does not
appear to have been presented to the Supreme Court upon
this appeal. It could not properly have been presented, because the appeal was from the judgment alone, and this
action was subsequent to the judgment and independent of
it. We act only upon the judgment of the Supreme Court.
Only such questions as either have been or ought to have

WRIT OF ERROR DISMISSED.

I. A., in 1812, made a deed to V. conveying to him valuable estates, V. by a
separate instrument, agreeing that if A. would, within five years, pay
to him a certain sum ($14,500), he would convey to A.'s children, then
infants, a part of this estate, and convey also to them a part of certain
other estates. Soon afterwards V. acknowledged that A. had paid to
him a large part ($11,600) of the money to be paid.
On proceedings in equity many years afterwards, in the Circuit Court of
the United States, the children, now become of age, prayed for1st. A dancellation of the deed by A., as having been fraudulently procured by V.
2d. That if this would not be decreed, then, on payment by the children
of the balance with interest, for a specific performance by V. of his contract to convey the two parts of the estates which he had agreed to convey, if $14,500 were paid in five years.
8d. If the court would make neither of these decrees, then that it would
decree that V. should refund with interest the $11,600 purchase-money
that had been paid to him.
The Circuit Court in 1853 refused to decree a cancellation of A.'s deed,
refused also to decree that V. should specifically perform his agreement
to convey; but as to the return of the $11,600 purchase-money paid, the
court said that it could not pass on that matter, proper parties not being
before the court, and made no decree about it. Proper parties came in,
and after hearing, the court refused to order a return of the purchase-

money, and, finally, A.D. 1872, dismissed the bill by A.'s children.
Held, That no "final decree" in the sense of the statute which authorized appeals from the Circuit Court to this court in the case of final decrees in equity was made in 1853, nor indeed before 1872; and that the
decree then entered brought up the whole ease; that is to say, brought
up the question of cancellation, the question of specific performance, and
the question of return of purchase-money.
2. Where the transactions out of which a case now before the court arose, occurred sixty-five years ago-litigation about them having been going on
all the while-and the particular one before the court was begun thirtyfive years ago, the court declared it to be high time that the case was
ended, and that the court was not inclined to add to its length of years
by looking after matters of mere form (objections of which were apparently now first made), in order to avoid substance.
3. In a court of con-cience deliberate concealment is equivalent to deliberate
falsehood. 'When a living man speaks in such a court to enforce a dead
man's contract with himself against parties who he knows are ignorant
of the factc, he must be frank in his statements, unless he is willing to
take the risk of presumptions against
him.
4. Accordingly where a party who has never been in possession comes into
equity to enforce a deed for valuable estates made twenty-five years before, by the parents (now dead) of the persons now proceeded against,
and which persons. when the deed was executed were young infants,
has his bill answered by them, they stating that they were very young
when the transactions relied on occurred, and that they had no personal
knowledge about them, denying generally the allegations of the bill, suggesting many grounds for serious doubt as to their truth, and demanding
of the claimant full and express proof of the fairness of the.deeds, and
of the full payment of the alleged considerations thereof, and of the circumstances of the execution of the deeds, it behooves the complainant,
so far as he possibly can, to give such information, and if he shelter
himself behind the mere execution of the deeds themselves, saying in
his pleadings that be "1cannot suppose that it will be necessary for him
to allege or prove the payment of the consideration acknowledged in
solemn form by the parties to the said deeds until the fairness of the
transaction and fulness of consideration is impugned by proof," the
court will hold that he has come before it with hands not clean, if in
the progress of the case, and as things are developed, it turns out that
he had agreed to reconvey part of the property, with other property,
upon payment of a certain sum, and that he has acknowledged payment
of a part of the sum, though he have agreed to convey only in case the
sum were all paid within a certain time, and though he now aver, that
in point of fact, the acknowledgment was made on a supposition that
the person to whom it was paid would pay certain debts, which he failed
to pay, &c. And the court will accordingly order the deed to him to
be cancelled, and will not help him to obtain payment of even such
minor claims as perhaps he really and justly had.

Statement of the case.-Samuel King.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the Western District
of Virginia. The case was thus:
William King, of Abingdon, a village of Washington
County, in the southwest corner of Virginia-a man possessed of valuable brine springs, at Saltville, close by it, and
of other large estate-died in 1808 childless, leaving a wife
and eight brothers and sisters; among the brothers one
named Samuel, and among the sisters one named Hannah,
married to John Allen. He left also a nephew, William
King, Jr.
By his will he devised the bulk of his estate, valued at
about $500,000, to his nephew (the said William King, Jr.),
on a condition which, as things turned out, proved impossible. The fact of the impossibility of the condition led at
once to litigation, and in 1880 and 1836, the will in two different suits was the subject of construction in this court.
It was held in the first suit,* that the whole estate was
devised to William King, Jir. (the nephew),;subject to the
life estate of the widow, but as it belonged to a court of
chancery- to determine whether he took the estate to his
own use or in trust for the heirs of the testator, that question
was left undecided. Accordingly, a bill in chancery was
filed to test that question, and in that case, the second one,
this court decided that he did take in trust for the heirs.t
Samuel King, and Mrs. Hannah Allen, the wife of John
Allen, thus each became entitled to an eighth part of the
estate. Samuel King lived at Somerset, a place in Pulaski
County, in the southeast corner of Kentucky; Allen and
his wife at Saltville. The two places were, perhaps, two
hundred miles apart.
Independently of any general interest acquired as just
mentioned by Samuel King in his brother William's estate,
the brother by his will had made a special provision for him
thus:

the manager at Saltville, or to my executors at Abingdon, on
the 1st day of Ianuary annually, $150. If not called for on that
day to be void for that year. Receipt to be personally given."
The testimony of different witnesses thus described Samuel
King.
One said"He was notoriously and incorrigibly intemperate; though
not often in such a condition that he could not go about."
Another said:
"I do not recollect that I ever saw him where spirituous
liquors were to be had that he did not drink to excess."
A third:
"He was generally intoxicated; that is to say, generally
speaking, when I saw him he was so."
A fourth:
"If I ever saw him sober, I have no recollection of the fact.
He was in the habit of constantly drinking."
This Samuel King, as the testimony further showed, was
not only intemperate but was always considered very poor.
One witness, Mr. Fox, of Somerset, clerk of the County
Court of Pulaski, Kentucky, thus testified:
"To the best of my recollection he was at all times in a manner destitute of any property or credit. I.well recollect that
he applied to me as often as three times to borrow the sum of
$5, each time, as he said, to defray his expenses to Abingdon,
Virginia, where he was going to draw his legacy coming to him
from the estate of his brother William King, which sums I lent
him, he promising to refund the amounts upon his return, which,
however, he never refunded."
Mr. Benjamin Estill, a lawyer, long resident in Abingdon,
Virginia, said:
"He was believed to be totally insolvent for three years before
his death, which event took place in 1812. I have seen him
several times in Abingdon applying for his annuity, and understood that he came on foot from Somerset in Kentucky, where
he lived."

Statement of the case.-John Allen.

Besides being poor and given to drinking spirituous liquor
in excess, there was testimony about him thus, ard there
was no testimony .to contradict it,
One witiess said:
"I always considered him as a very wild and visionary man,'
incapable of making bargains to any amount, when he had been
drinking, and especially when there was any intricacy in the
transaction."
Another said:
,"I never saw him at any time in a condition when he could
contract or trade to any advantage to himself or his family."
Additional witnesses confirmed this account of him; one
saying:
"I never saw him after the death of his brother, that I thought,
him capable of transacting business of any kind. He ought to
have had a guardian, and if he had been in the North would
have had one."
We have mentioned that one of the heirs of William
King, of Abingdon, was his sister Hannah, married to John
Allen.
Allen's character was thus testified to.
One witness said:
"John Allen's general character as to correctness of dealing
in money matters was bad. I am not able to say whether
Samuel King was an easy subject for fraud. But Allen's general character was such that he would take advantage of any
man if an oppor'tunity offered, and he would do it so smoothly
that the person imposed on would consider him a friend."
A second one said further:
"I was well acquainted with John Allen, and knew no good
of him. I thought him capable of committing frauds of anyenormity:'

tioversies, the subject of this report. His name was John
Vint, and he was entitled "of Washington City in the District of Columbia."
Vint was an Englishman, who came to the United States,
in 1800. His relation to the parties connected with this
suit begins about the year 1810, when he is found in inti-.
mate relations with Allen; but the mode of origin of his
said relation was nowhere distinctly shown, nor with any
detail. His name was connected, in the present case, with
large transactions. How far property was traced with distinctness as being really his, so as to enable him to purchase,
in the way, as it will be seen in the sequel, that he alleged
he truly did purchase in this case, will appear by the testimony which follows.
One witness said:
"I never saw him till he and John Allen came to purchase a
negro girl I owned. I knew nothing of his pecuniary condition.
I was acquainted with Allen before. I sold them the girl. They
never paid me."
Another witness, one Russell, said:
"In November, 1810, Mqr. Vint had a store in the house of
Mr. John Allen, and had there a considerable quantity of goods,
which were said to be Vint's; but I do not recollect that I ever
heard either Allen or Vint say that they belonged to Vint. I
was frequently at the store. The shelves were pretty well filled
with a good display. I heard it spoken of about that time, that
Vint had sold out to Allen. Previous to that time Allen was
frequently embarrassed, but as respects the condition of property I am not informed."
A third witness, Francis Smith, an attorney at law, who
had married the widow of William King in 1811, but who
testified that he had no interest whatever in the result of the
suit, confirmed the view of these two witnesses:
"Previous to September 5th, 1812, there were placed in my
hands for collection large claims on Allen. I know that he was
hard pressed long before in his pecuniary affairs, and that he
was never able to purchase and pay $11,600 for any property.

Statement of the case.-Samuel King, his disappearance and death.
He had nothing, and was able to purchase.nothing. About this
time I frequently saw both Allen and Vint. They were sometimes in jail and sometimes out. I thought both of them without property or means."
A fourth witness, one Stout, however, testified in rather
an opposite way. He said:
"I recollect the sale by John Allen to John Vint of his interest in the estate of William King, for the sum of about $18,000.
I understood from John Allen that at the time of the sale he
owed to him, Vint, a small sum, about $2000, and that the balance
of the purchase-money was paid by Vint in goods, which Allen
afterwards told me he had received. I farther know of my own
knowledge that Allen did receive a great many goods from Vint."
However, as stated, infra (see p. 433), by Vint himself,
this sum of $18,000 was not a true consideration.
We now return to Samuel King, already mentioned as
intemperate, poor, and visionary. We have stated that he
lived in Kentucky and was obliged to come in the beginning
of each year, in person, to Saltville or Abingdon, to give his
personal receipt for the $150 left to him by his brother's
will. He came for the last time in January, 1812, when he
claimed payment for two years.
A witness, resident at Abingdon, thus testified:
",When he came to Abingdon, he came to Allen's; Allen kept
a public house. He came there drunk, riding a little chunk of
a pony, and dressed in a common dress. He was almost always
drunk during the time that he was there. When he got to Abingdon he was asked by Allen's family how he had paid his expenses from Kentucky, and whether he had put up at private
houses or at taverns? He said that he had put up at any place
that he could get in at, and told the persons with whom he put
up that he would pay them on his return; for that he would
get this year two years' payment. Allen told him that he
could get but one, for that he had not come for the last year's
payment at the right time, and that under the terms of the will
it was gone. Allen's family told me that he was a poor man;
and Mrs. Allen, his sister, told him in my presence to return to

his family, for that they would suffer in his absence. I thought
him to be deranged from intemperance, and this opinion was entertained by the family of Allen generally."
Having got payment for either one or for two years, King
set off on his pony to go back to his home, in Kentucky.
He arrived at the house of a man named Pridemore, about
sixty miles from Abingdon, to stay all night, and "while
there," according to the language of a person who saw him,
appeared "during the evening to be very uneasy, going frequently to the door in a state of alarm, and saying that he
feared a man bythe name of John Allen, and other persons
who were following him from Abingdon, and that he would
be assassinated." In the morning his hat and boots, pocketbook and saddle-bags were in his room, but he himself
could not be found, and was never again seen or heard of.
For some time grave suspicions of murder rested both upon
Pridemore and upon Allen. But it finally rather appeared
that King had gone out of the house in the middle of the
night under the influence of mania a potg, and wandering
through the forests thereabouts had fallen into a rapid
stream, swollen by recent rains, and was lost among the
gorges of the mountains which rise in that region. The
whole matter, however, remained much a mystery.
His pony, saddle-bags, pocket-book, hat, and boots were
sent back to his brother-in-law, Allen, by whose wife the
saddle-bags and pocket-book were opened and examined.
They contained papers but no money.
The unfortunate man himself left, at the time of his death,
three children, aged respectively about one, three, and five
years.
Allen died not long after, also leaving several children,
all young.
We come now more particularly to certain facts of this
case.

It seemed plain enough that on the 16th of November,
1810, Allen and wife executed a deed by which, for the professed "consideration of $18,901.27, current money, to them
in hand paid," they conveyed to Vint all the right and in-

terest which the said Allen, in right of his wife, and also
which his said wife had in the estate of the said William
King, that is to say one-eighth part of that estate; and also
a certain fifth part of the eighth of the estate which came to
Samuel ]King as one of the heirs, which fifth the deed recited that the said Samuel had conveyed to Allen, who was
to reserve it as a compensation to counsel, for services in
the suits already mentioned at the beginning of the report
of this case (page 422), brought to establish in effect an intestacy, and the rights of the heirs.
This deed had apparently been witnessed on the day of
its date, November 16th, 1810, in the ordinary way, by
three witnesses; but was not then acknowledged, proved, or
recorded. On the 27th of April, 1812, fifteen months after
the date of its execution, and as was specified on it, "at the
request of Allen," its execution was attested de noro by two
other witnesses. On the 7th of May fbllowing, it was proved
for record in the way required by the laws of Virginia.
The scrivener who drew the deed testified that he drew
it carefully; the transaction being large; but that he knew
nothing about the true consideration of it.
It seemed further, plain enough, that on the 1st of January, 1811, Samuel King had executed a deed by which, for
the professed "consideration of the sum of $10,000 to them
in hand paid," he and his wife had transferred to this same
Vint four-fifths of their interest in the estate of William
King, brother of the said Samuel; the remaining fifth having, as the deed declared, been conveyed by them to Allen,
in the way already mentioned, as compensation to counsel,
in attending to the suits to establish the rights of the heirs.
Tl~e wife's execution of this deed, as it was produced, was
by a mark. The execution of this deed was not witnessed,
nor did the deed itself state where it had been executed,
that is to say, whether in Virginia (at Abingdon or Saltville),
where Allen lived, or at Somerset, in Kentucky, where King
and his wife, the grantors, lived. But it appeared that on
the 29th of January, 1811, that is to say twenty-eight days
after the day stated in the instrument as the date of its exe

Statement of the case.-The pleadings.

cution, the instrument had been acknowledged by King and
his wife in Somerset, Kentucky, where King and his wife
lived, and by King then given to the recorder there for
record, and afterward by the recorder returned to King;
Vint not anywhere appearing in this transaction.
Pulasli County, in Kentucky, in which State the lands
conveyed by this deed did not lie, was not the proper place
for the record of the deed of King and wife to Vint. The
deed was not proved in Washington County, Virginia, where
the lauds did lie, till the 25th of September, 1837.
With this statement by way of prosecenium, we will now
state the pleadings and further developments in the case:
In January, A.D. 1825, during the pendency of the litigation in some of its forms, about the estate of the original
owner of it, William King, who, as we have already said,
died in 1808, a bill was filed in the Circuit Court of the
United States by some of the heirs to obtain a partition of
the lands not incumbered by the widow's life estate, and on
the 25th of April, 1836, after the last of the decisions in this
court, an order was entered appointing commissioners to
make this partition. These commissioners afterwards made
a report, and, among other things, assigned to the children
and heirs of Samuel King, and the children and heirs of
Hannah Allen, the wife of John Allen, one-fourth. the property divided.
On the 24th of September, 1838, Vint filed an original
bill against the heirs of Samuel King and the heirs of Allen
and wife, in which he set forth substantially that each had
become owners of one-eighth of the estate of William King,
of Abingdon, and then alleged that he was the owner in fee
of their interest in the estate. He stated that his title to
the Allen interest and one-fifth of the King interest was obtained by the already mentioned deed from Allen and wife,
dated November 16th, 1810, in which, for the consideration
of $18,901.27, they conveyed the same to him; and that his
title to four-fifths of the King interest was by the alreadymentioned deed from King and wife, dated January 1st,

OROSBY V. BUCHANAN.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.-The pleadings.

1811, in consideration of $10,000, executed and recorded in
Kentucky. Of both these deeds, their tests, probates, &c.,
he appended copies to his bill. But he appended nothing
else; nor did he state or intimate in the bill, or by anything
appended to it, that the transactions were in reality in the
least other or different than what a reader would infer from
reading the two instruments themselves. He stated rather,
on the contrary, that be did'not desire a suspension of the
proceedings in partition any further than was necessary to
protect his rights, and that he was willing to accept the lands set
off to the heirs as andfor his share. And the prayer of the bill
was to the effect that he might be substituted for these heirs
in the partition proceedings, and that whatever was assigned to
them might be adjudged to him.*
In September, 1839, all the defendants answered the bill,
and in substance stated that they were very young when the
transactions referred to occurred, and that they had no personal knowledge as to the matters in controversy. They denied generally all the allegations in the bill adverse to their
interests, and suggesting many serious grounds of suspicion
against the validity of the claim of Vint, demanded from
him full and express proof of all the material averments of
his bill, and especially for proof of the fairness of the deeds,
and of the full payment of the consideration thereof, and of the
circumstances of the execution of the deeds and the alleged payments. The death of the widow of William King, the orig
inal owner, was also suggested, and the heirs of Samuel
King stated that they had conveyed their interest to a certain Findlay.
On the 19th of September, 1839, Vint filed his supplemental bill, making Findlay a party, and also alleging the
death of the widow, and asserting his right to the interest
of Samuel King and Hannah and John Allen in the property devised to her fbr life and assigned to her for dower.
In this supplemental bill he stated as follows:
"Your orator cannot suppose that it will be necessary for him
to allege or prove the payment of the consideration, acknowledged in solemn form by the parties to said deeds, until the

Oct. 1874.]

Statement of the case.-The pleadings.

fairness of the transaction and fulness of consideration are impugned by proof; but your orator asserts the payment of a
full and fair consideration for their interests, which were then
wholly contingent. Indeed, your orator was reduced from affluence to poverty by this very consideration paid for said interests. The deed f'om Allen and wife was duly admitted to
record in the Circuit Court for Washington County, Virginia,
on the 7th day of May, 1812, and the deed from Samuel King
was duly admitted to record in the County Court of Pulaski
County, Kentucky, where said Samuel King resided, on the 29th
day of January, 1811, and on the 25th day of September, 1837,
upon proof of the genuineness of said King's signature, the said
deed was admitted to record in the County Court of Washington County, Virginia. . . . Your orator did not deem it necessary to prosecute his claim by suits until the suits should be
determined in which the question was made whether William
King, son of James King, took under the will of William King
as devisee of his real estate, or whether it descended and passed
to his heirs at law. It was, moreover, useless, and would have
been premature to have asserted your orator's claim in the salt
works and dower property until the life estate should be determined. Your orator is advised that he has been guilty of no
laches from lapse of time, since he is in full time for the partition, which has not yet been made of any part of the estate."
To this supplemental bill Findlay answered, setting up
his title under the conveyance from the heirs of Samuel
King, and insisting upon several defences not now material
to be stated.
After the filing of the supplemental bill much testimony
was taken. On the 7th of February, 1840, Francis Smith,
who married the widow of William King, the original owner,
gave his deposition, and in it furnished a copy of a contract,
as follows:
"This agreement, entered into this 6th of April, in the year
of our Lord 1812, between John Allen, of the county of Washington, in the State of Virginia, of the one part, and John Vint,
of the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, of the
other part, witnesses that the said John Vint, for and in consideration of the sum of $14,450, to be paid by the said John

to make the payment to the said John Vint of the sum aforesaid, for and during the term of five years from this date, then,

And afterwards a receipt as follows was discovered:

affidavit. This affidavit was annexed to Smith's deposition,
and, in the part material to this case, was thus:
"This day came John Vint before me, John Gibson, a justice
of the peace for Washington County, Virginia, and made oath,
that on the 16th November, 1810, he purchased from John Allen
all his interest in the estate of William King, deceased, and after
that purchased from said Allen all the interest of Samuel King in
said estate, for which he was to have given, and did give, said
Allen credit on a debt due from him to this affiant for $10,000;
but that said Allen then stating that he wished the receipt executed by this affiant to be for a larger sum than the sum really
given in order to promote his credit to the northward by the
largeness of the payment he was making his creditors, this affiant agreed thereto, and executed his receipt for about $8000
more than the sum he was to give. Thus the business stood
until April, 1812, when this afflant entered into another contract
with said Allen in writing of that date, by which contract he
sold and agreed to convey to the children of John Allen, by his
wife Hannah, one-half of all his interest in William King's estate
upon the payment by John Allen to this affiant of $14,000.
" JOHN VINT.

"Subscribed and sworn to before me this 5th September, 1812.

Other testimony was from time to time taken in the cause,
and finally, in December, 1842, the heirs of Hannah and
John Allen filed their cross-bill, in which they stated, that
since the filing of their answers they had learned other facts
most material in their character, and having an important
bearing upon their rights and interests. They averred that
these facts, "though necessarily well known to complainant
(Vint), since he was an actor, and is the only surviving actor
in the transaction, he has thought fit, from motives which
cannot easily be misunderstood, to suppress." After referring to their extreme youth at the time the transactions
occurred, and other circumstances likely to prevent their
becoming acquainted with the facts, they set forth the foregoing contract and receipt, which had then recently been
discovered in their search after the truth of the case. They

then charged that the failure of Vint to bring these matters
to the knowledge of the court was such a fraud on them as
must deprive him of the aid of a court of conscience in the
premises, and claimed that under the circumstances of this
case the payment of the balance of the purchase-money due
upon the contract should be presumed. They prayed:
1st. For a cancellation of the deed from Allen and wife to
Vint; or,
2d. If that could not be granted, a specific performance
of the contract; or,
3d. A return of 'the purchase-money shown by the receipt to have been paid.
To this cross-bill Vint answered in September, 1848. He
denied all charges of fraud and improper suppression of
truth, and then said:
"The respondent fairly purchased and paid for the interest
of John Allen and Hannah, his wife, and of Samuel King, in the
estate of William King, deceased, and by deeds duly executed
the said parties regularly conveyed their interest to him. For
these deeds reference is here made to the exhibits filed by this
respondent to his original bill. Some time after these purchases
and the execution of said conveyances, it is true that this respondent did make with John Allen the contract of the 6th of
April, 1812 (given, supra, pp. 431-2), but Allen did not pay him
the purchase-money within five years, or at any time, and having
failed to do so, the contract became void. He admits the execution of the receipt, and alleges that beyond this there could
be no pretence of any payment. He denies that he received all
the money mentioned in that. He 'recollects distinctly that as
part of the sum embraced in the receipt, a draft on John Jelf
for $2333 was included, and that it was protested and never paid.
A part of the sum also was made up of debts of Vint, which
Allen assumed to pay for him but never did pay."
He then said:
"The contract on which the $11,600 aforesaid purports to
have been paid and the receipt for that sum, were not retained
by this respondent in his hands, as the complainants would seem
to indicate, but were handed over to John Allen; and as the said

.Statement of the case.-The pleadings.

Allen and his heirs are interested in the said papers, this respondent supposed that they would take care of them, and at
all times have them at their command. This respondent has
certainly never had the said papers under his control, and this
having been the case, it seems extraordinary to him that the
complainants should gravely charge him with improperly concealing contracts and papers which they must have known were
never in his possession."
On the 17th of April, 1844, Findlay filed his cross-bill
against Vint, in which he asked that the deed from Samuel
King to Vint might be set aside for fraud. In this bill he
charged that the deed was obtained by the fraudulent combination of Vint and John Allen to divest King of his interest in the estate, and stated that proof bad already been
made in the case that Vint had said he purchased this interest from Allen. He then stated that the actual consideration for the deed was $6000, payable in ten equal annual
instalments, for each of which a note was given. That none
of these notes had been paid, and that Vint had nine of
them in his possession. He charged that they were unfairly'
obtained by Vint, and probably in consequence of his dealings and combination with Allen. He called for an answer
under oath.
To this cross-bill Vint filed aii answer on the 8th of April,
1845, in which he adopted as part of it the answer which he
had before filed to the cross-bill of Allen's heirs. He denied
that the deed to him was obtained by fraud. He said that
he could not undertake to say with certainty whether or not
John Allen exerted any material agency in bringing about
the sale by King, but denied all fraudulent combination for
that purpose. He admitted that no money had been paid by
him to King, and that the consideration was as stated in the
cross-bill, and he appended copies of the ten notes. All of
them were payable in negroes, in Abingdon, at cash price.
The three first falling due were payable to King, or his order.
The others to the children of King by Paiseg, his wife. The
execution of all was witnessed by John Allen. A receipt as
follows was produced and made part of his answer:

He then said that in pursuance of this agreement King
did execute the deed in Kentucky, and that under it he
claimed title. He then said that Allen procured from ]King
nine of the ten notes and delivered them to him, and that
the amount of these notes was included in the receipt for
$11,600, stated on p. 432, as part pay of the contract between himself and Allen, of the 6th of April, 1812; and
that he received the notes in good faith from Allen, supposing that Allen had obtained them fairly from King. The
notes were yet unindorsed by any one.
One of them--one of the three payable to King, and the
one that first fell due-was assigned by indorsenient made

Vint died in 1847, and the cause was afterwards duly revived; one Buchanan, his executor, being made a party in
his stead.
The testimony being closed the cause was heard, and on
the 24th September, 1858, a decree rendered:
1st. Annulling the deed from King to Vint and ordering
a reconveyance; declaring that no conveyance was ever
made by King to Allen of the one-fifth of his interest; adjudging costs in favor of Findlay and the heirs of King
against Vint's representative.
2d. Denying the prayer of the cross-bill of Allen's heirs
for a rescission of the deed from Hlannah and John Allen to
Vint; denying the prayer for a specific performance of the
contract of April 6th, 1812.
8d. And ordering that the personal representative of John
Allen be made a party, with a view to the determination of
the question presented by the further prayer of the cross-bill
for a return of the purchase-money paid upon this contract.
The ground of this last order was that the court did not
have before it all the parties necessary for the purpose of
making a final disposition of the whole cause.
On the 21st of November. 1872, the cause was again heard
and the cross-bill of Allen's heirs finally dismissed. From
that decree this appeal was taken, by Crosby and others,
Allen's heirs; the heirs and representatives of King being
satisfied, of course, with what had been done in respect to
them, and neither they nor the representative of Vint making an appeal.
Messrs. J. A. Johnson and J. A. Meredith, for the appellant:
I. The court below as a court of equity, in which capacity it
acted, had no jurisdiction.
The bill of Vint does not 'ask partition, but refers to a

Oct. 1874.]

CROSBY V. BUCHANAN.
Argument in behalf of Mrs. Allen's heirs.

suit for partition pending in the same court, in which a
division had already been made, and declares that the complainant is willing to abide by that division, and that the
subject of controversy in the suit is the part of the estate of
William King, of Abingdon, claimed by the descendants of
Samuel King and Hannah Allen, &c. The bill, then, is an
application on the part of Vint to a court of equity, to say
whether he or the heirs of Samuel King and Hannah Allen
had the better title to the real estate assigned to the said
King and Allen in another suit. Vint was not and had not
been in possession; his claim was not recognized as valid,
but rejected as invalid by all the persons with whom he
pretended to be tenant in common. Now, a bill which does
not ask partition-which says it has been made in another
suit-which asks the court to decide a question of right to a
particular parcel of land-which prays that possession be
given of what is held adversely by others-is in fact an action of ejectment and not a bill for partition. That must
relate to an undivided estate, and must ask that the interests
of each be separated from the others.
I. But concede that jurisdiction exists, the decree below was
wrong.
1. All Vint's bills should have been dismissed for laches.
He obtained from King and wife their deed in January,
1811, and the deed from Allen and wife in April, 1812, but
he did not institute this suit until September, 1838. In the
meantime a suit was pending for the construction of the
will of William King, upon which depended the value of
the shares conveyed by these two deeds. He did not make
himself a party to these suits, claiming the shares of Samuel
King and Hannah Allen, but he remained passive and silent
until Hannah Allen and Samuel King, and every living
party to these transactions was dead but himself; and then,
for the first time, asserts his claim.
2. As to the merits.
The only question is as to the Allen share; that is to say,
as to M1rs. Allen's eighth part in her brother's estate. The
deed of King conveying his eighth, has been decreed to be

CROSBY V. BUCHANAN.

[Sup. Ot.

fraudulent and null; and from this decree Vint's representative makes no appeal. The fraud of Vint as to that part,
therefore, stands confessed.
Our allegation, however, is that the two deeds, and the
contract of April 6th, 1812, to reconvey on payment of
$14,450, and the receipt of April 7th, 1812, for $11,600
(supra, page 432), form parts of one transaction, and that
the deed from King having been decreed to have been obtained by fraud, the other deed and papers fall as fraudulent
also.
On this account only do we advert to the now effete and
worthless deed from King and wife to Vint.
Our allegation further is that Vint asserting a large, and
probably grossly excessive claim ($10,000) on Allen, for the
sale of store-goods to him, and Allen being insolvent or
nearly so, and meaning to put his own life estate in his wife's
eighth of her brother's property beyond the reach of creditors other than Vint; these two persons-Vint and Allenentered into a fraudulent conspiracy by which,
1st. Vint should get, through Allen's efforts, King's eighth,
and cancel the debt of $10,000 which he alleged that Allen
owed him, and by which,
2d. Allen's life estate, under the devise of a provision for
his children, should be withdrawn from his creditors other
than Vint;- and by which,
3d. Under the same device the interest of Mrs. Allen, the
owner in fee-an interest which neither Vint nor any other
creditors of Allen could touch-should pass to Vint as security for the payment of a balance due to him by Allen on
other accounts, and shown by the exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3,
supra, pp. 437-8.
We assert that the deed of King to Vint, dated January
1st, 1811, was procured by Allen's influence; that it was executed at Allen's house in Abingdon; that Vint's notes for
$6000, the consideration for it were left with Allen, until
the deed should be taken by King to Kentucky, be executed
and acknowledged there by Mrs. King, and be returned to
Allen; that Allen kept Vint's notes till January 1st, 1812,

Oct. 1874.]

CROSBY v. BUGHANAN.
Argument in behalf of Mrs. Allen's heirs.

that he then gave them to King; that King had them in his
saddlebags when he was murdered or disappeared soon afterwards; that Allen then became repossessed of them and
surrendered them, all except one (against which Vint was
subsequently indemnified, in the way mentioned in Exhibit
No. 2, supra, p. 437), to Vint, and that Vint thereupon cancelled his claim on Allen for store-goods; Vint thus getting
King's eighth of the estate of the original owner, his brother,
for nothing but his (Vint's) surrender of a claim of $10,O00
on Allen, a man quite insolvent; a claim, therefore, which
was good for nothing.
Now to prove our position.
The deed from King and wife to Vint bears date January
1st, 1811, on which day King was doubtless at Abingdon to
get his annuity. All Vint's notes, the consideration for the
deed, are witnessed by Allen, who resided there, but who is
not shown to have ever been in Kentucky. One is transferred to Allen on the next day, January 2d, 1811. The
deed is not witnessed, because it purported to be by King
and his wife, and the wife was not there to execute it. It
was acknowledged by King and his wife in Kentucky on
the 29th of January, 1811, when obviously King had just
returned home; and by King was then given to the recorder
for record, and by the recorder after record returned to
King; Vint nowhere 'appearing to have had possession or
control of the instrument at all. King in his receipt (supra,
p. 436) promises to forward the deed when "legally and
completely done" by him and his wife, to Allen; and Vint
in his affidavit given to Francis Smith (supra, p. 433) says
in terms, that " he purchased from Allen all the interest
of Samuel King, for which he was to have given and did
give said Allen credit on a debt due this affiant (Vint) for
$10,000."
It is apparent, therefore, that Allen was the person who
brought this conveyance and so-called sale about; that he
did it by means of a deed made directly from King and wife
to Vint, executed under pretence that King was about to
get Vint's notes for $6000, which notes were doubtless left

ORosBY v.

BUCHANAN.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument in behalf of Mrs. Allen's beirs.

in Allen's hands under a promise that they should become
King's when the deed should come back or be brought back
from Kentucky properly executed by the wife, and properly
acknowledged; it having, however, been understood between Allen and Vint, that Allen would indemnify Vint
against any liability on these notes, and that the true consideration was the surrender of the claim of $10,000 on Allen
for store-goods sold in 1810 or thereabouts. There was no
risk in this to Vint, for if he ever should be made to pay
the notes, he had acquired an estate far above the amount of
them; while as to his claim of $10,000 on Allen it remained
where it was.
But the understanding between Vint and Allen was carried out. Vint did in a subsequent transaction with him,
and where he paid really nothing for them, get back from
Allen all the notes but one, and against that one he was indemnified, as appears by the Exhibit No. 2, supra, p. 437.
It may indeed be that, the original purpose as to King was
but to get his one-eighth of an estate worth $500,000, for
the grossly inadequate consideration of the ten notes payable through a term of ten years in negroes, an.d that the
more shocking scheme which in April, 1812, was actually
achomplished, was not devised until after Allen had got repossessed of Vint's notes after King's death. The exact
time when the fraud actually perpetrated was concocted is
not important.
We assert now further, that Allen after King's death became possessed of these nine notes of Vint by fraud.
Our theory is that the notes of Vint never left Allen's
hands till Janudry, 1812. It is not likely that Allen would
have parted with the notes before the deed came back from
Kentucky. Possibly the deed never did come back till King
came back himself on the 1st of January, 1812, to got his
annuity, and that he then brought it back himself. If King
had received the notes prior to leaving Abingdon for his
home in 1812, his family would have had them. He would
not have brought them back to Abingdon January 1st, 1812.
But the notes are found April 7th, 1812, in Allen's posses-

Oct. 1874.]

OROSBY V.

BUCHANAN.

Argument in behalf of Mrs. Allen's heirs.

sion. How did Allen have them then? -There is but one
way of accounting for his possession of them. King, we
know, disappeared-was murdered or destroyed himselfjust after leaving Allen's house, in the beginning of 1812.
Whether Allen murdered him or whether he destroyed himself will never be known with certainty, until that dreadful
day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. But
this we know now-that King's last utterances were that he
"was afraid of a man named John Allen and other persons
who were pursuing him." And if drink had made him
mad it does not follow that in his idea there was not a truth
"that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could
not so prosperously be delivered of."
But whether Allen murdered King or not, we know that
King's saddlebags, containing papers, were sent, not to his
own family in Kentucky, to whom they ought to have been
sent, but to Allen's family at Abingdon. What papers were
these? As King is shown to have possessed no other property than Vint's notes, and as these notes never came to the
possessibn of King's family, and as on the 7th of April, 1812,
they are found in Allen's possession, the presumption is
violent that the papers were nine of Vint's notes given for
the purchase of King's eighth. The tenth one Allen had
already by King's indorsement.
We now come to the 6th of April, 1812, and more particularly to the Allen eighth. Possessed of these notes of Vint,
in the spring of 1812, and King's deed to Viiit having been
duly executed and acknowledged, Allen is ready to carry
out with Vint a full scheme; whether one devised originally
to the full extent in which it was now executed, or in that
full extent now first conceived and carried out, is unimportant.
And here it is to be noted that the deed of Allen and wife
to Vint, though executed November 16th, 1810, does not
appear to have left Allen's possession at that time. It was
not acknowledged at that time, nor then recorded. On the
contrary, on the 27th of April, 1812, eighteen months after
its execution, two new witnesses attest it at the request of

CROSBY v. BUCHANAN.

[Sup. Ct.

Allen.; and it is ut proved for record until the 7th of May,
1812.
At this time Allen was not indebted to Vint except in a
small amount shown by the Exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Vint
admits in his affidavit made for Francis Smith, that his claim
of $10,000 had been paid by Allen's sale to him of King's
eighth.
The parties, therefore, except as to a small debt from Allen
to Vint, as shown by Exhibits Nos. 1, 2, and 3, were unindebted to each other; each with one-eighth of the original
estate, but Allen holding in his own hands a deed by which
he conveyed his and his wife's eighth to Vint. The parties were confederates, and dependent on each other. Each
knew the fraud of the other. They now fell upon this device.
Allen delivers to Vint the deed from himself and wife, conveying their interest to Vint, in eonsideration whereof Vint
executes the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, by which
Vint agrees to convey to the children of John Allen and
Hannah his wife "one-half of all the interest which lie, the
said John Vint, may have in the estate of William King, deceased, by a conveyance from John Allen and Hannah his
wife, bearing date the 16th day 9 f November, 1810; and also
by another conveyance from Samuel King and wife, bearing
date the 1st day of January, 1811."
Vint did not stipulate to reconvey to Allen's children
the same interest that had been conveyed to him by Allen
and wife. If he had done so, the fraud would be apparent
upon the face of the two papers. But as this contract bore
date two years subsequent to the date of the deeds, it had
the appearance of a new contract, one distinct from that of
the deeds; and as this appearance would be strengthened by
the conveyance of a different interest, they fell upon the
device of conveying to the children a moiety of each of the
interests conveyed to Vint by each of the two deeds. They
sought to strengthen further this appearance of fairness by
the nominal consideration of this contract. It will be observed that the consideration to be paid Vint by Allen is
$14,450.63, which is precisely the half of the two sums men-.

tioned in the two deeds as their respective considerations.*
The contract contained a clause that there should be a forfeiture of the contract if this sum was not paid in five years.
If the arrangement had stopped here Allen would not
have got anything. Before he could have demanded the
reconveyance, he would have had to pay $14,450.63, the
estimated value of the interest. It would have been better
for him, instead of doing this, to have permitted his lifeinterest to be taken by his creditors; since the fee simple
would have still remained to his children through their
mother. It became necessary then to resort to another device to relieve Allen of this dilemma; and the device resorted to was this. Vint on the 7th of April, 1812-one
day after the date of the contract-gives a receipt to Allen
for nearly the whole amount of the nominal consideration;
acknowledging the receipt of $11,600, in part pay of the
contract entered into on the preceding 6th, and declaring
it to be on account of the estate of William King, deceased,
and for the benefit of John Allen's heirs.
It is admitted by Vint that the amount of nine of the notes
given by him to King and now surrendered by Allen, was
included in the $11,600, and that he supposed that Allen
came by them honestly. That this is false is plain. The
notes were unindorsed by any one. As to those payable to
King's children, as the children were infants, they could be
assigned only by order of court. When Vint received the
notes he must have known them to have been stolen. Allen
was the thief and Vint was the receiver of the goods.
But to resume our history. After deducting the amount
of the receipt from the nominal consideration expressed in
this contract, there then remained a balance due from Allen,
which he would have to pay before he could demand a con*veyance from Vint of the interest stipulated for in the contract of 6th of April, 1812. The reason why the receipt did
In the deed from King to Vint, the consideration is the sum of $10,000.
In the deed from Allen to Vint, the consideration is the sum of $18,901.27;
the one-half of which is $14,450.63, the consideration named in the contract
of the 6th of April, 1812.

CROSBY V. BUCHANAN.

[Sup. or.

not cover the whole nominal consideration, but left this balance due, is explained by the circumstance that Allen was
indebted to Vint on other transactions, which amounted to
nearly this balance, and which were produced by Vint on
that day in an account rendered, and dated the 6th of April,
1812, the date of this contract, with the interest calculated
on the several items down to that day, which amount was
acknowledged by Allen to be due. See the Exhibit No. 1,
supra, p. 437. The amount due on this account added to
the amount due on another account settled between the same
parties, amounted to about $2600 (as appears by the Exhibit
No. 3, supra, pp. 437-8), leaving a difference between this sum
and the balance due as aforesaid on the nominal consideration of the contract of 6th April, 1812, of about $250. This
difference was made by Vint, doubtless, with the intention
to cover the interest that would accrue on the sum actually
due between this day and the time when he would receive
enough from William King's estate to pay it. By thus retaining this balance on the nominal consideration of this contract, it furnished Vint security for the amount really due
him from Allen on these other transactions, and forced Allen
to pay it before he or his children could get anything from
the estate of William King under the contract of 6th April,
1812. This debt of Allen to Vint is again acknowledged by
Allen on the 20th June, 1812, in Exhibit No. 2, supra, p. 437,
and a lien given on his interest in William King's estate.
He then had no interest except that secured by the contract
of 6th April, 1812.
The case establishes, we submit, the following conclusions:
That the deed of Allen and wife was not delivered to Vint
until the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt
dated on the next day, were signed and delivered by Vint
to Allen, and Allen delivered to Vint the notes which Vint
had given to King; that the interchange of these papers was
contemporaneous, and consequently that the said contract
and receipt and the delivery of said bonds constitute the
real consideration of the deed from Allen and wife to Vint;
the consideration consisting in part of King's interest, pro-

cured by the combined fraud of Vint and Allen, which renders the deed from Allen and wife to Vint fraudulent and
void. The extent to which this interest of King formed a part
of the consideration, is not to be measured by the moneyed
value of that interest at the time. It was the controlling
inducement which led to the delivery of Allen's deed and
the execution and delivery by Vint of this contract and
receipt.
That no moneyed consideration passed between two such
men as Allen and Vint is palpable, and is admitted by Vint
in his answers to the cross-bills, though in his original bill he
avers that the deed from Allen and wife was "for the consideration of $18,901.27," and the deed from King and wife
was "for the consideration of $10,000." He thus proves his
own averments to be false. Vint has, in fact, offered no
explanation as to the true consideration of that deed, but
has contented himself with a vague and general averment
in his answer, that he fairly paid fbr the interest of John
Allen and Hannah his wife; and this averment is made in
response to special and searching interrogatories, calling on
him to state the true consideration of this deed. This evasive answer, this ominous silence, should condemn the whole
transaction, and stamp it with the fraud charged in the crossbill, and not explained by a party cognizant of every circumstance, and the only party to these transactions then
alive, and alone able to give the explanations called for.
This, in a court of equity, is an admission of the fraud
charged. To this should be added the facts that he suppressed the contract of the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt of the 7th of that month, and claimed the whole of
these two interests in his original and supplemental bills;
and that every living party to these transactions, except
Vint, was dead, when he filed his bill, twenty-seven years
after the transactions occurred, asserting claim under the
deed fi'om Allen and wife and King and wife.

upon the construction of a trust exclusively within thejurisdiction of a court of equity. The relief which he asked was
a partition and a restraining order or injunction against the
assign ment of any portion of this estate to the heirs-at-law
of King and Allen. The established rule is that it is not
enough that the party has a possible remedy at law, or even
a convenient remedy, but that to divest the equitable jurisdiction of the court, the legal remedy must be an adequate
one, and it must be as convenient as the remedy that a court
of equity affords.* In fact, as Vint's title was but equitable
-the legal estate having"been decided by this court to have
been in the nephewt-he could not have maintained ejectment.
In addition, the case does not stand upon the original and
supplemental bill, but the defendants have filed cross-bills,
impeaching for alleged fraud the conveyances under which
the complainant claims. The complainant has answered.
Issues peculiarly appropriate for chancery have thus been
raised by the families of Samuel King and Mrs. Allen.
II. Assuming thatjurisdiction to review exists, how much of the
case below is to be reviewed? No part, we suppose, but that
relating to the purchase-money paid upon the contract of
April 6th, 1812; the question whether it was paid. The
decree made in 1853 was final. It decreed that the deed
from Allen and wife to Vint, dated November 16th, 1810,
was valid' that the deed from King and wife to Vint, dated
January 1st, 1811, was void, and denied the prayer of the
cross-bills for specific performance of the contract between
Allen and Vint dated April 6th, 1812. Those were the
only questions which the pleadings, as they then stood, did,
or could in fact raise. No other question touched in any
manner the title to the property, nor has any question since
been presented affecting that title. In short, the decree of
1853 decided the right of property in contest, and no appeal
having been taken from that decree for nineteen years, this

court is now without jurisdiction to. review it.* The complainant was entitled to have that decree immediately carried
into effect.
III. If, however, the decree of 1853 was notlinal, and the
same, so far as respects the Allen part, is now subject to
review, we say that there was no error in the decree.
1. There were no unexplained laches.
Until the determination of the question, whether Samuel
King and Hannah Allen took any estate under the will of
their brother, there was no necessity, nor any propriety, in
fact, in Vint's instituting a suit to recover the property.
In the ascertainment of that question there was no delay,
because a suit was pending and not decided, in this court,
until 1830. Vint did not make himself a party to that suit,
and could not, because it was an action of ejectment to recover possession of a definite portion of the estate which had
not been apportioned or divided, and in which Vint had no
right to any particular part; nor was there any necessity
that he should do so, because the suit being between parties
from whom Vint, Allen, and King's heirs alike claimed
title, they were all privies, and would be bound by the
judgment of the court therein.
2. As to merits. The whole of the opposite case rests on
the assumption that King was at Abingdon January 1st,
1811, under Allen's influence, and that Allen by fraud and
duress coerced him to make the deed to Vint. Bit1st. When King came, in 1812, to claim his annuity, he
claimed annuity for two years; one due January 1st, 1811,
and the other due now, January 1st, 1812; and Allen told
him that under his brother's will he could not get the one
for January 1st, 1811, because he had not then claimed it.
The fact that he did not claim it on the 1st of January, 1811,
tends to show that he was not at Abiugdon at that date.
2d. The deed made Janupary 1st, 1812, is by Samuel King
and his wife. It is not shown nor alleged that she then or
ever left her home in Kentucky.

[Sup. Or.

Argument in behalf of Vint's title.

The case of the opposite side assumes, in addition, an
enormous scheme of fraud. When such a scheme is relied
on-a gigantic scheme, involving an immense mechanism,
carried on by two parties through two or three years-plain
proof should be made, at least of the leading facts. Such
proof is not made. Because such a scheme is imaginable
by an active fancy and is actually imagined by the opposite
counsel, it does not follow that Vint and Allen imagined it,
still less that they carried it out.
Reliance is placed in the argument of opposite counsel
upon the fact that Vint "suppressed"-that is to say, that
he did not produce and set forth in his bill-the contract of
the 6th of April, 1812, and the receipt of the 7th, and that
he claimed the whole of the two-eighths.
The argument assumes that those two papers not only
were really, but also that they were known and felt by Vint
to be, at the time that he filed his bill, still operative and
obligatory papers; assumes, in other words, that he meant
in filing his bill to commit a fraud. But is not that a matter
to be proved? By the terms of the contract the rights of
Allen's children under it ceased, unless the contract on their
side was carried out within five years; that is to say, unless
it was carried out by the year 1817. Was it, in truth, A.D.
1838 an obligatory paper? The question raised one of the
nicest points in scientific equity; that is to say, how far time
is of the'essence of a contract? The general rule is that a
party who comes into equity to enforce a contract must not
have been guilty of laches, and that on the contrary he must
have shown himself" ready, desirous, prompt, and eager."'
There was raised, in addition, and independent of the matter of time, the difficult question of mutual and dependent
covenants; and how far the failure of Jelf to pay his note
for $2333, which had been received at the time as cash,
and how far the failure of Allen to pay certain debts of
Vint's which he had promised to pay for him, reduced the
receipt of April 7th to nothing. These things, according to
Vint's answer to the cross-bill of Allen's heirs, largely made
up the receipt. Was Allen, in filing a bill A.D. 1838,

plainly and necessarily bound to know and to feel that the
paper still bound him? If he was not, he was not bound to
say anything about it. A pleader is expected to state his
own case, and to state it as strongly as he can. He is not
bound to anticipate all objections to it and then to show
those objections to be unfounded. Suppose that in fact the
contract did not, owing to lapse of time, bind him when he
filed his bill. What would have been thought of a bill
which, after setting out the deed to Vint, then added: "It is
true indeed that there was a contract? &c.;" . . . and, after
setting out the contract in extenso, then went on to show
perhaps in extensiori, for each severally, a hundred and one
reasons why it had no longer any force? Who ever heard
of such pleading, either at law or in equity ? It would have
been in plain violation of the fundamental rules of pleading; rules as ancient as the common law itself,* and taught
in elementary text-books.t When treating "Of the Principal Rules of Pleading," Serjeant Stephen gives one thus:
"3. It is not necessary to state matter which would come more
properlyfrom the other side."
And, commenting on it, says:
"The meaning is, that it is not necessary to anticipate the answer of the adversary; which, according to Hale, C. J., is 'like
leaping before one comes to the stile.'T It is sufficient that each
pleading should in itself contain a good primdfacie case, without
reference to possible objections not yet urged."
The transactions to be passed on are very ancient, complicated, and obscure. Matters may have got mixed up.
The consideration of one deed may have been mistaken for
that of another. Vint's notes were perhaps not the consideration for the deed from King. Proofs cannot be given as
of recent things. It is plain, however, that Vint did have
property in 1810; a large assortment of store goods. The

witnesses, Russell and Stout, both prove this by their testimony, supra, pp. 425-6. Allen was reported to have bought
these goods. No doubt he did. It is plain, too, that they
had other transactions. The exhibits, Nos. 1, 2, and 3,
supra, pp. 437-8, show this. Suppose that Vint was at one
tine in jail. Does that prove that he may not have previously had control over a large amount of goods and sold
them to Allen? He may have been imprisoned for the
price of those very goods. And how does the fact that
Allen was in jail with him bear on the case? it being confessed that Allen owned a life estate in his wife's eighth of
her brother's estate, and that she owned the fee, and both
having conveyed to Vint?
Even if Vint had wanted candor in not stating the fact of
the contract and receipt, of April 6th and 7th, how does
that show that the deed of the 6th was without consideration ?
The CHIEF TUSTIOE delivered the opinion of the court.
The first question we are to determine is as to the extent
of our power over the several orders and decrees of the
court below. The appellees claim that it is confined to an
examination of the question of the return of the purchasemoney paid upon the contract of April 6th, 1812, while the
appellants insist that the appeal reaches back and includes
the decree of September 24th, 1853, so far as it relates to
that part of the case in which they are interested. All agree
that our inquiries are limited to the Allen title. The King
title was disposed of adversely to the appellees in 1853, and
they have not appealed.
In 1853 the court determined that it would not decree a
cancellation of the Allen- deed, and would not order a specific performance by Vint of his contract. This determination it caused to be recorded, but at the same time declared
that it could not then make a final disposition of the whole
cause, because it did not have before it all the parties necessary for that purpose. In 1872, when the cause was ready
for final hearing, the court accepted this recorded opinion

as settling the rights of the parties, so far as it went, and
then proceeded to consider the question which had not been
determined. Upon this hearing that question was decided
against the complainants in the cross-bill, and then a final
decree was entered denying the relief asked by the defendants. This ended the case in the court below.
Cases cannot be brought to this court upon appeal in
parcels. We must have the whole of a case or none. The
court below must settle all the nierits before we can accept
jurisdiction. Appeals will lie, as has been frequently held,
when nothing remains to be done except to enforce and give
effect to what has been decreed, but until all the rights of
the parties have been finally passed upon and settled this
cannot be the condition of a cause. Nothing must be left
below when an appeal is taken but to execute the decree.
That was not the condition of this case in 1853. An appeal then would have left the question of the return of the
purchase-money undetermined. The rights of the parties
as presented by the pleadings were not all settled. The
powers of the court below were not all exhausted. If the
remaining question had been settled in accordance with the
prayer of the cross-bill the present appellants might have
been satisfied and the appeal saved.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the decree of 1853
was not final so far as it respects the Allen title, and that
the appeal brings up the whole of that part of the case for
our consideration.
It is first insisted by the appellants that a court of equity
has no jurisdiction of the case, and that for this reason the
bill should now be dismissed.
So far as we can discover from the record, this objection
is raised here for the first time. The transactions out of
which this case arises occurred sixty-five years ago, or thereabouts. The estate of William King has been the subject
of litigation, in some form or other during all that time.
This particular suit was commenced thirty-six years ago
and more. It is high time it was ended. At any rate, we

are not inclined to add to its length of years by looking after
mere form in order to avoid substance.
This brings us to the case upon its facts. The record is
voluminous, but to our minds the controlling facts are few.
In a court of conscience deliberate concealment is equivalent to deliberate falsehood. When a living man speaks in
such a court to enforce a dead man's contract with himself
against parties who he knows are ignorant of the facts, he
must be frank in his statements, unless he is willing to take
the risk of presumptions against him.
In this case Vint waited until both Allen and his wife
were dead before he attempted in any manner to assert his
claim. This he had the legal right to do. His laches is not
a bar, but it is still a fact, and when it is remembered that
some of the parties he is now pursuing were not born until
after his rights, if any he has, accrued, this silent fact has all
the effect of positive statement.
The rights of Samuel King's heirs are not before us for
adjudication, but the facts upon which their rights depend
cannot easily be separated from those we must consider.
.Allen and Vint seem to have been almost inseparable
when the transactions we are to pass upon occurred. King
was a man of intemperate habits. His brother, William
King, from whom the property in controversy came, made
provision in his will for the payment to him of the sum of
$150 annually, so long as he lived, in case he applied for it
personally to the manager of the salt-works at Saltville, or
the executor of the will at Abingdon, on the first day of
January in each year. His personal receipt was required,
and the payment for the year was to be forfeited if not called
for on the day.
He lived in Kentucky, ad Allen and Vint at Abingdon.
His contract to sell to Vint bears date January 1st, 1811.
That was the day he was required to be at Saltville or Abingdon to receive his annuity. The contract was witnessed
by Allen and wife, and the notes given for the purchasemoney, all bearing that date, were witnessed by Allen.

Oct. 1874.]

CROSBY V. BUCHANAN.4

C,

1455

Opinion of the court.-Merits.

The note first falling due was assigned by him to Allen on
the 2d of January, 1811, the day after its date. From these
admitted facts the conclusion is irresistible that King was in
Virginia when the contract was made, and that Allen must
have been cognizant of it, if not active in bringing it about.
In January, 1812, King was again at Abingdon. While
there he staid at Allen's house. In the month of February,
or the forepart of March, he started for his home in Kentucky. He stopped for the night at a house about sixty
miles from Abingdon, and was never afterwards seen. He
left his saddle-bags at the house where he stopped, and
these were afterwards taken to Allen's house and opened
by Allen's wife. When opened they were found to contain
his clothing and a pocket-book. In the pocket-book were
papers, but no money.
The deed from the Allens to Vint bears date November
16th, 1810, and was executed by Mrs. Allen on that day.
It was not proved for record until May 7th, 1812. Its execution appears first to have been attested by three witnesses,
and then, on the 27th April, 1812, at the request of Allen,
by two more. The presumption is, therefore, that it had
not been delivered before that time.
On the 6th April, 1812, Vint made his contract for the
conveyance to Allen's children of one-half of the property
covered by the two deeds. On the next day Vint executed
his receipt for the payment of $11,600, part of the purchasemoney. Part of this payment consisted of nine out of the
ten notes given by Vint for the purchase of the King interest. It cannot for a moment be doubted that Allen had
no title to these notes, and that Vint knew it. So far as
appears by the testimony none of them were indorsed when
surrendered, and seven out of the nine were payable to the
children of King. The disappearance of King caused much
excitement at the time, and was extensively known. The
persons at whose house he stopped for the night had been
suspected of his murder. Allen was poor, and in the summer following he and Vint were in jail together for debt.
In the face of all these circumstances it is impossible to be-

CRoSBY V. BUCHANAN.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.-Merits.

lieve that Vint told the truth when in his answer to the
cross-bill of Findlay he stated that he received the notes
"as he believed from one who had a right to their possession, and whose right to transfer them to him was unquestionable."
As has been seen, Allen's deed could not have been delivered until after the 27th April, 1812. The presumption
is, therefore, that payment for the property had not been
made previous to that time. Allen was not a man to be
trusted, even by Vint, with so large a payment as the nominal consideration required without a delivery of the deed.
The deed had been drawn with great care, as the scrivener
testifies, because the transaction was important. If the contract had been fully consummated in good faith-at its date,
there can scarcely be a doubt that the deed would have been
at once perfected and proved for record. This, as we think,
disposes of the theory that the property had been paid for
by Vint with his stock of goods in 1810. Vint did not set
up any such claim in any of his answers, and most assuredly
he would have done so if it had been true. Besides that, no
satisfactory testimony has been adduced in support of the
claim. The only witnesses who testify upon the subject
speak very indefinitely, and one of them makes some statements which are directly contradicted by well-established
facts. In September, 1812, Vint himself stated, in an affidavit, "that on or about the 16th November, 1810, he purchased from Allen all his interest in the estate of William
King, deceased, and after that, purchased from Allen all of
the interest of Samuel King in said estate, for which he was
to give and did give credit on a debt due from him to affiant
for $10,000." There is nothing here about a payment in
goods, and besides, according to the affidavit, the King purchase entered as much into the credit as did that of the
Allen interest.
But still more important is the absolute refusal of Vint to
disclose the facts in his answers when directly called upon
to do so. It is true that he need not make the statements
unless he chose. The law under the form of pleadings in

Oct. 1874.]

Opinion of the court.-Merits.

this case did not compel him to be more specific, but it can
raise presumptions against him if he is not. He may, if he
pleases, rest his case upon the acknowledgment of payment
expressed in his deeds, but if he does he must take the
chances of being overcome by other facts and circumstances
which repel the presumption arising from such evidence.
In this case the circumstances are emphatic. He slept upon
his rights for a quarter of a century; he waited for every
actor in the premises except himself to die; in all the litigation affecting his interests he never appeared so long as
there was one alive who could speak against him from
actual knowledge of the facts, and during all the time he
permitted his adversaries to assume and represent his title.
But we are not inclined to pursue this inquiry further.
To our minds it is clear that in April, 1812, when the transactions upon which the rights of the parties depend, were
completed, it was well understood by all that the original
interest of Mrs. Allen in the estate of her brother had been
in some form secured to her children. It is quite possible
it may also have been understood that Vint was to have a
lien upon it by way of security for the payment of some
debt owing to him; but it is certain, as we think, that it
was never intended he should hold it as owner.
When, therefore, yint came into court and asserted his
absolute title as against the ignorant heirs of these deceased
contracting parties, and wilfully concealed his contract for
a reconveyance and the receipt which belonged to it, he
came with unclean hands and must suffer the consequences.
He does not excuse himself for this attempted fraud by
pleading defect of memory, but claims boldly that he was
not required to tell all he knew; that his duty was at an
end .when, selecting his own facts, he presented his own
case. It is true he had the right to select that-vay of coming into court, but having deliberately made his selection
he ought not to be surprised if he finds that he is received
with suspicion. Honesty of purpose prompts frankness of
statement. Concealment is indicative of fraud.
If Allen and Vint were the only parties interested in this

THE Rio GRANDE.

controversy the case would be different. They have been
partners in fraud and neither can claim a preference over
the other on account of honesty of purpose or fairness in
dealing. But Allen's interest in the property was only that
of a tenant for life. The real owner was his wife, and upon
her death her children succeeded to her rights. It is the
title of these children that Vint now attempts to defeat. By
his own admissions in commencing his proceedings against
them' he concealed the truth. He thus in effect confesses
that he relied to some extent for his success upon their ignorance. After years of groping in the dark, they were
able to confront him with the facts and, as we think, to defeat the case he has attempted to make against them.
