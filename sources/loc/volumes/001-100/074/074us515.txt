A.ec. 1868.]'

MOORE V. MARSH.'
Statement of the case.

It is quite clear, thprefore, that this court cannot proceed
to pronounce judgment in this case, for it has no longer
jurisdiction of the appeal; and judicial duty is not less
fitly performed by declining ungranted jurisdiction than in
exercising firmly that which the Constitution and the laws
confer.
Counsel seem to have supposed, if efFect be given to the
repealing act in question, that the whole appellate power of
the court, in cases of habeas corpus, is denied. But this is
an error. The act of 1868 does not except from that jurisdiction any cases but appeals from Circuit Courts under the
act of 1867. It does not affect the jurisdiction which was
previously exercised.*
The appeal of the petitioner in this case must be
DisMIssED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.

MOORE V. MARSH.
Under the fourteenth section of the Patent Act of 1836, enacting that damages may be recovered by action on the ease, to be brought in the name
of the person "interested," the original owner of the patent, who has
afterwards sold his right, may recover for an infringement committed
during the time that he was owner. The word "interested," means
interested in the patent at the time when the infringement was committed.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania.
The eleyenth section of the Patent Act of 1836, relating
to the.assignment of patents, thus enacts:
"Every patent shall be assignable in law either as to the
whole interest, or any undivided part thereof, by any instru- ment in writing, which assignment, and also every grant and
conveyance -of the exclusive, right under any patent to make

and use, and to grant to others to make and use the thing pat.
ented, within and throughout any specified part or portion of
the UnitedStates, shall be recorded," &c., &c.
And the fourteenth section, which relates to damages in
suits, brought by the owners of patents, for infringement,
says:
"And such damages may be recovered by action on the case,
in any court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought in the
name or names of the person or persons interested, whether as patentees, assignees, or as grantees of the exclusive right within
and throughout a specified part of the United States."
This statute being in force, Moore, a patentee, brought
suit in the court below, against Marsh, for infringement.
Marsh pleaded that after the date of the alleged infringement, he Moore, the patentee, had sold and assigned an undivided half of the patent for the district where the infringement was alleged to have been committed. To this plea,
Moore demurred. The court having sustained the demurrer,
and judgment being given accordiigly, the case was brought
here by the patentee on appeal.
The general question therefore, was, whether a sale and
assignment by a patentee of his patent right is, under the
fourteenth section above quoted, a bar to an action by him
to recover damages for an infringement committed before
such sale and transfer? In other words, whether the words
of the statute "name of the person interested," meant, as
the plea assumed, "persons interested in the patent at the
time when the suit was brought;" or meant, as the declaration assumed, interested at the time when the cause of
action accrued.
The case was submitted on briefs.
Mr. S. S. Fisher,for the patentee, appellant, argued, that the
latter, or interested in the damages, was the plain meaning;
that it would be unreasonable and contrary to all analogies
of the law, that a simple assignment of a patent-right should
carry with it the right to all previo'us damages, carry with it

all the damages which had ever accrued to its former owners
in the whole course of the patent's like, and frbm the date
of the letters patent; that back damages were not a matter
hiherent in, sticking to, and inseparable from the patent, but
were a matter which belonged to the owner in his individual
right. And this natural view, he considered, was supported
by the authority of this court in -Dean v. Mi-tason.*

section above cited.

were frequently the only parties interested in the damages,

no interest in the damages.

them) of this court and of several of the circuit courts.t
An opposite view, they contended, might lead to gross
oppression. According to such view, a party who, in mistake
as to his rights-and in these nice questions of mechanical
principle, innocent mistake might well occur-may have infringed a patent during a number of years, is exposed at the
end of the term, to as many separate suits for infringement
as.there have been separate owners- of the patent during the
time he has been using it; and may have to defend against
fifty separate actions brought by as many different plaintiffs
Ibr what has been a continuous act of user of the patented
machine. Such a hardship could never be intended by Congress, and this court would not'put a construction oh the act
fraught with such oppressive consequences. This argument,

pressed it in behalf of the court, and by Mr. Justice Grier,
in Blanchard v. Eldridge,t where speaking of the eleventh
section of the act, he says that "the act of Congress has
not subjected even a pirate of the machine to fifty different
suits by fifty several assignees, whose several interests might
be affected."
-Deanv. Mason, relied on by Mr.Fisher (the counsel argued), did not apply. It was an assignment pe-ndente lite,
and
moreover of a mere license.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Viewed in the light of the admitted facts, the only question in the case is whether the assignment by the plaintiff to
a third person of an undividled half of the right, title, and
interest secured to him by his letters patent, subsequent to
the alleged infringement, but before the commencement of
his suit, is a bar to his claim to recover damages for such
infringement.

Letters patent were granted to the plaintiff on the 18th of
April, 1848, for a certain new and useful improvement in
grain drills, in xihich it is alleged that he is the original and
first inventor of the improvement. Origiiial patent was for
the term of fourteen years, but it was subsequently extenrded
by the Commissioner of Patents for the term of seven years
from and after the expiration of the original term. Alleged
delects -existed in the original specification, and in consequence thereof, the plaintiff, on the 3d of February, 1863,
surrendered the letters patent, and the- same were reibsued
to him in three new patents for separate and distinct parts
of the invention for the unexpired portion of the original
and extended terms of th'e patent.
Damages are claimed of the defendants for infringing the
reissued letters patent from the day of the reissue to the
24th of February, 1865, as more fully set forth in the declaration.

Opinion of the court.

Pleas to the declaration were subsequently -filed by the
defendants, and the record shows that they gave due notice
of certain spe~ial defences which they proposed.to offer in.
evidence under the general issue, in pursuance of the act of
Congress in such cqse made and provided. Before the day
for the, trial came, however, the parties filed'an agreement
waiving a jury and submitting the causd-to the court, stipulating that the decision of the court should have the same
effect as the verdict of a.jury. Leave to amend was subsequently granted'by the court to both parties.
Purport of the amendment to the declaration was, that
the plaintiff was the sole owner of the letters patent for the
county of Union,,in the State of Pennsylvania, from the date
of the reissued letters patent to the 24th of February, 1865,
and that the defendants had infringed the same throughout that period, by making and using the invention, and
vending the same to others to be used without his license or
consent.
Defendants filed another special plea, in which they alleged
that the plaintiff, when he commenced his suit, was not the
owner of the exclusive right secured in the reissued letters
patent within any part of the United States; that in certain'
States and districts he had parted with all his interest in the
patent; and that, on the said 24th of February, he assigned
and transferred an undivided half of all the residue of his
right, title, and interest in the same, and, therefore, that theplaintiff had no right to bring this action in his own name,
against the defendants. Plaintiff demurred to the plea, and
the defendants joined in demurrer. Parties were heard,
and thd court rendered judgment for the defendants, and
the plintiff sued out this writ of error.
Conceded fact is, that the plaintiff was the. exclusive owner
of the patent in the territorial district where the alleged infringement was committed, throughout the entire period of
the imfi-ingenient, as alleged in. the declaration. Express
allegation of the declaration is to that efect, and, as the
plea *is in avoidance and contains no denial of the'matters
alleged in the declaration, they must be considered as ad-

Opinion of the court.

mitted, unless the matters alleged in the special plea are a
sufficient answer to the action. •
Briefly stated, the matter alleged in avoidance of the right
of the plaintiff to maintain the suit is, that he, before he
commenced the suit, but subsequent to the infringement-,
sold and assigned an undivided half of his patent fbr the
territorial district where the infringement was committed, to
a third person.
Patentees have -secured to them, by virtue of the letters
patent granted to them, the full and exclusive right and
liberty, for a prescribed term, "of making and using, and
vending to others to be used," their respective inventions
or discoveries; and, whenever their rights, as thus defined,
are invaded by others, they are entitled to an action oil the
case to recover actual damages as compensation for the injury.*
Such damages may be recovered by action on the case in
any Circuit Court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought
in the name or names of the person or persons interested,
whether as patentees, assignees, or as grantees of the exclusive right, as already defined, within and throughout a specified part of the United States.t
Assignees and grantees; as well as the patentee, mdy,
under some circumstances, maiitain an action on the case
for an infringenent, in their own name, as appears by the

express words of the act of Congress. An assignee'is one
who holds, by a valid assignment in writing, the whole interest of a patent, or any undivided part of such whole interest, throughout the United Stp.tes.1
Where the patentee has assigned his whyle interest, either
before or after the patent is issued, the action must be brought
in the name of the assignee, because lie alone was interested
in the patent at the time the infringement took place; but
where the.assignment is of an undivided part of the patent,
the action should be brought for every infringerent com.
nitted subsequent to the assignment, in the joint names of.

the patefitee and 'signee, as representing the entire interest.*
Settled vieW"at one time was, that the grantee of a territorial right,,for a particular district, could not bring an action on.the'patent in his own name; but the actof Congress
having made him a party interested in the patent, it is now
equally well settled that he may sue in his own name for
invasion of the patent in that territorial district, as no one
else is injured by any such nfringement.t
Both assignees and grantees have an interest in the patent, but the terms are not synonymous, as used in the pateint

law.$

Grants, as well as assignments, must be in writing, and
they must -convey the exclusive right, under the patent, to
make and use, and vend to others to be used; the ling patented, within"and throughout some specified district or portion of the United States, and such right must be exclusive
'of the patentee, as well as of all others except the grantee.
Suits for infringement in such districts, if committed subs6quent to the gralit, can only be .brought in the name of the,
grantee, As it is clear that no one can maintain such an action until his rights have been invaded, nor until he is interested in the damages to be recovered.
Alleged infringement in this case was committed.in the
county of Union, in the State of Pennsylvania, and the admitted fhct is, that the plaintiff, throughout the entire period
of the infringement, WTas the sole owner of the exclusive
right to make and use, and grant to others to make and
use, the thing patented in that territorial district, by virtue
of his origindl title as patentee, having never assigned or
granted any right, title, or interest, within that county.§

Opinion of the court.

Grant that these views are correct, and it is clear that
unless the plaintiff can maintain the action there can be no
redress, as it is too plain for argument, that a subsequent
assignee or grantee can neither maintain an action in his
own name, or be joined with the patentee ill maintaining it
for any infringement of theexclusive right committed before he became interested in the patent. Undoubtedly the
assignee thereafter stands in the place of the patentee, both
as to right under the patent and future responsibility; but it
is a great mistake to suppose that the assignment of a patent
carries with it a transfer of the right to damages for an inf'ingement committed before such assignment.
Comment upon the cases cited, as supporting this proposition, is unnecessary, as it is clear to a demonstration that
they give it no countenance whatever. Such a proposition
finds no support in any decided case, nor in the act of Congress upon the subject.
True meaning of the word interested, as employed in the
last clause of the fourteenth section of the Patent Act, when
properly understood and applied, is, that the right of action
is given to the person or persons owning the exclusive right
at the time the.infringemient is committed. Subsequent sale
and transfer of'the exclusive right are no bar to an action to
recover damages for an infringement committed before such
sale and transfer.
The reason for the rule is, that the assignee or grantee is
not interested in the damages for any infringement committed before the sale and transfer of the patent. Correct interpretation of the words, person or persons interested, is,
that the words mean the person or persons interested in the
patent at the time when the infringement was committed,
which is the cause of action for which the damages may be
recovered.*
Assiginment was made in that case after suit was brought,
but before the final decree. Proof of the fact was offered,
aud a motion filed to dismiss the case, but the court over.

NEW VENIRE ORDERED.

RANDALL V. BRIGHAm.
1. An action fot damages does not lie against, a judge of a court of general
jurisdiction, for removing, whilst holding court, an attorney-at-law,
from the bar, for malpractice and misconduct in his office, the" court
being empowered by statute to remove attorneys for "any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct;" and having heard the attorney.
removed, ir explanation 'of his conduct in the transaction which was
the subject of complaint. And such action will not lie against the
judge, e- an if the court, in making the removal, exceeds its jurisdiction,
unless perhaps in the case where the act is done maliciously or cor-

ruptly.
2. All j-. dicial officers are exempt from liability, in 4 civil action, for their
judicial acts, done within their jurisdiction; and judges of superior or
general authority, are exempt from such liability, even when their judicial acts are in excess of their, jurisdiction,'unless perhaps where the
acts in excess of their jurisdiction are done maliciously or corruptly.
3. Formal allegations, making specific charges of malpractice or unprofelsional conduct, are not essential as a foundation for proceedings against
attorneys. All that is requisite to their validity, is that, when not taken
for matters occurring in open court, in the presence of the judges, notice
should be given to the attorney of the charges made, and opportunity
uaforded him fbr explanation and defence. The manner in which the
proceeding shall be conducted, so that it be without oppression or injus-'
tice, is a matter of judicial regulation.
4. The construction given to a provision of the constitution of a State, by
the highest court of that State, not called in question by any conflicting
decision of that court, is conclusive upon this court.
