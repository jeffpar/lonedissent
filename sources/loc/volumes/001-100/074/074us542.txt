Statement of the case.

The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the ct urt.
The revisory jurisdiction of this court over th6 judgments
of State tribunals, is defined by the twenty-fifth section of
the Judiciary Act of 1789. It is there provided that the
citation must be signed by the chief justice, or judge; or
chancellor of the court rendering or passing the judginent
or decree complained of, or by a justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States. But the citation in' the- case
before us, was signed by a, district judge. This was without
authority of law, and the citation was, therefore, without
effect. The case therefore'is linot properly in this court, and
the writ of error must be
DISMISSED.

1. A contract made by a consul of a neutral power, with the'citizen of a
belligerent State, that he will -'protect,"'with his neutral name, from
capture by the belligerent, merchandise which such citizen, has in the
enemy's lines, is against public policy and void.
2.-During the late rebellion the President alone had power to license commercial intercourse between places within the lines of military occupation, ty forces of the United States, and places under the control of insurgents against it. Hence the general orders of the officer oÂ£ the United
States, commanding in the department, could give no validity to such
intercourse.
8. Where suit is brought upon a contract which is void as against public
policy and, the laws, a party who pleads such invalidity of it does not

In this state of things, a circular of the treasury, of J'uly
3, i863' declared 'it to be the" intention of that department
to allow no intercourse at all beyond the national and ivithin
the rebol lines of military occupation. " Across these lines,"
ws its language, "there can be no intercourse, except that
of a char~cter exclusively military."
A treasury regulation also said:
".Commercial intercourse -with localities beyond the lines of,
military occupation by the United States forces, is strictly prohibited; and no permit will be grantedfor the transportation'of any
property to any place under thecontrol of insurgents against the
United States."
This regulation was'made under an act of Con gress,*
which, forbidding all commerciil -intercourse-between territory proclaimed by the President--to be in insurrection
(which the .territory about New Orleans had bpen, though
New Orleans was not), and the citizens of the rest of the
*United States, and .enacting that all merchandise coming
from 'such territory into other parts of the United States,
should be. forfeited, authorized the PRESIDENT to permit
such intercburse, in such articles, for such tifle, and by
such persons as he rmight deem proper; proriding,however,
that such inteicourse, so far as licensed, should be carried

a British subject, and acting British consul, at New Orleans,
and trading there (William Mure being the coilsul), made
a contract, through one James Gonegal, with a certain Hall,
a citizen of Louisiana, residing like Coppell in New Orleans,
but both being, at th6 time of the contract, in rebel territory,
by which Hall agreed to," furnish" the said Coppell with a
large number of bales of cotton, all of it being then in rebel
territory, and owned chiefly by one Mann, also a citizen of
Louisiana, resident apparently in the rebel region of it;
cotton being at the time an article specially soqght for by
both combatants; 'shielded and preserved by each while it
was in his own .possession, and destroyed when found, without an ability on his own part to' capture it, in possession
of the other. By this contract, Coppell on his part agreed
"to cause'said cotton to be protected and transported to New
Orleans, and disposed of to the best advantage, paying to said
,Hall, first, tlhe actual cost of it, with two-thirds of the net
profits, &c.o without commissions- retaining one-third of the
profits as his compensation."' Coppell now marked a large
part of the cotton with his private mark, and soon afterwards issued certificates (the marks and other designations
of the cotton being set forth on a document appended), in
this form:

of the case.

Under, these "protections," and escaping destruction from
either government or rebels, the cotton remained on Mann's
estate, in the rebel region, and in his and Hall's bharge,
until the rebel forces there surrendered to the governthent:
The whole region coming thus again under the -contrpl. of
the United States, and it becoming easy to transport cottonfrom the surrounding counitry to 'ew Orleans, and there to'
dispose of it to advantage at a rate of fa'ctoraze much. less
than one-third the profits, Hall and Mann declined to furnish
Coppell with the cotton. Coppell, thereupon, in the court
below, by petitions, in-which, referring to the contract. as'
made "under the'permission" expressed in military general
orders, and alleging that he had been able and desirous to
bring the cotton to New Orleans at the time of the contract,
and that Hall and Mann bad prevented him, to his damage
$50,000; now demanded possession of the cotton "for the
purposes enumerated in the agreement," or if he should be
adjudged not entitled to such pbssession, then to Lave d'aniages.
The defendants set up that the contract was null and void;
as 'being in violation of public policy of the laws of the United States, and of the neutrality which Coppell, as.a British
subject, was bround to maintain. But that "if" it should be
.determined that the contract was valid, then that they, the
said respondents, "assuminr thie positions of plainiffs in reconvention," averred that Coppell- was indebted to.them in
damages $70,000, for not having transported the cotton to
New Orleans under British protection, and sold it during
the war; every of which things it was alleged that he was
unable to do, and none of which he had ever attempted or'
offeved to.do. And they prayed that he "might be qited.to
appear and answerthis reconventional demand.'
Coppell replied, that he was the consul of Her British Majesty; that he did protect the cotton from all seizures whiqh
his agreement included; and that, as 'soon as the- militay
situation permitted, he was ready and willing to perform all.

The court below charged:
1. That Hall and the plaintiff, both residing in New Orleans, the contract was valid under the law of nations.
2. That the military orders, then in force, authorized and
gae validity to the contract.
3. That the demand for reconvention, set up by the defendants, "cured any nullity or illegality in the contract, if
any existed, and that, under the pleadings, the plaintiff
might recover, notwithstanding such illegality.
And judgment having been given for the plaintiff for
'$29,644, the case was brought by the defendants here.
Messrs. Evarts and Ashton, for the plainiffs in error:
I. The court in effect instructed the jury:
1st. That a British subject, domiciled at New Orleans,
could make a valid contract, during the war, with a citizen
of the United States, by which such British subject should
agree to co'er and protect, with his neutral British name,
cotton situated in the hostile territory within the rebel lines;
and,
2d.' That a contract between such citizen and a British
consul at New Orleans, by which the latter agreed to issue
false certificates that such cotton was British property, with
a view to its protection within the rebel lines, was a valid
contract, enforceable in a court of the United States by that
British consul.
It needs no argument to disclose the error of such rulings.
We should suppose no one would have the hardihood to
doubt that such a contract was absolutely void, as against
public policy, and as in contravention of the belligerent
rights of the United States.* Nor do we believe that this
court will tolerate, for one moment, the monstrous doctrine,
that the issuing, by a British consul residing in our jurisdiction, of false and fraudulent papers, asserting that property

Argument for the consul.

in the enemy's country belonged to British subjects, is a consideration which will sustain a contract between that consul
and a citizen of the -United States.*
II. The military orders did not authorize the contract
sued on. At the date-of the contract all commercial intercourse with territory beyond our lines of military occupation
in Louisiana was strictly prohibited, except with the license
of the President. And no officer of the government, save
the President, had any authority to permit such intercourse
to be carried on by the plaintiff, and therefore no authority
except that of the President could take from such a contract
as this the "sting of disability."t
Independently of which, they were not meant to be relied
on. If they had been, the cotton would have needed no
British protection.
III. As to the effect of the further defence of "reconvention," ifthe first defence failed. The ruling of the court,
on this point, exhibits a total misapprehension of the character, foundation, and policy of the rule ex turpi causa non
oritur actio.
Every contract stipulating for the performance of an illegal,
act, or founded upon an illegal consideration, is rendered
void by the po'wer, and to conserve the policy, of the law;
and this altogether independcntly of the will or wish of the
parties concerned. An English judge declared, "You shall
not stipulate for iniquity." LorA Mansfield said, that it ishot for the sake of a defendant that the objection is ever'
allowed that a contract is immoral or illegal, but is founded
on general principles of policy, which the defendant has the
advantage of, contrary to the real justice of the case.1

the same community may make any transfer of personal property within the enemy's lines, not based upon, nor looking
to communication with the enemy. Coppell, either as British
consul or British subject, had then the right to enter into
this contract. Communication with the enemy was negatived by the presumption of law, which presumes the protection to be legal when it was reasonably possible. In aid
,"of this presumption it should be observed (as the fact was
within common knowledge), that the military occupation of
the region in which this cotton was situated frequently and
rapidly changed, the Federal forces to-day advancing beyond, and in a short time falling back on the hither side of
this region, and the Confederate forces receding and advancing correspon'dingly, so that communication with persons in
charge of the cotton would be strictly lawful at one time,
and the effect of that communication might be at another
tim6 to prevent the destruction of the cotton by the efiemy's
forces.
The restraints upon the defendant in error, as British subject or consul, were even less than those springing from his
domicile,,i. e., viewed as a member of thp community of New
Orleans; for the announced ittitude of his government, in
the proclamation of Her Britannic Majesty, of May 31, 1861,*
had not in the least added to the ordinary duties of neutrals,
nor imposed any additional restraints upon her subjects.
. The military general orders were the governing law of
a region wholly occupied by military force, and were a suffi
4ient permission for what was done.
3. The parties sued had, by their reconventional'demand,
taken the position of plaintiffs in the suit, The' set up the
contract, and claimed damages for its alleged, violation. By
taking that attitude they had waived their exception of illegality, and bQth parties alike stood upon the contract.t

upon a contract'eutered into on the 14th of September, 1863,
between Hall, one of the plaintiffs in error, and Coppell, the
defendant in error. It was agreed that Hall should furnish
Coppell 1169 bales of cotton,--789 bales at B. L. Mann's
place, about one mile from Arcola station on the Jackson
ra.ilroad, 47 bales at Gilman's, near Tangepahow, and the
residue in the parish of St. Helena, East Feliciana, and in
Williamson and Amity counties, Mississippi. Coppell agreed
to cause the cottoi to be.."protebted" and transported to
New Orleans, and disposed of to th; best advantage, paying
to Hall the actual cost of the cotton and two-thirds of the
net profits, "after deducting freights, taxes, &e.," Without
commissions, retaining one-third-of the profits as his compensation. It was further agreed, that if any of the otton
should be stolen, burned, or otherwise destroyed, Hall should
be exonerated to that extent; and that Coppell should pay
Hall, or cause him to be paid at Arcola, sums approximating
to the value of his interest, as the cotton was removed; such
sums to be indorsed on the notes given by Coppell 'to Hall;
one for $318,350.00, and the other for $57,000.00, both bearing even date with the contract.
Coppell was the plaintiff in the court below. His petition avers:. That he is a subject of Great Britain, and a %resident in that kingdom; That Hall, the plaintiff in error,
resides in the city of'Nev Orleans, and Mann, the other
plaintiff in error,"at Arcola station, in Louisiana; That Hall
and Mann delivered to him 1189 ,bales of. cotton, of which
789 bales were on the plantation of Mann, at Arcola, and
the remainder atvarious other placps mentioned in a schedule
annexed to the petition; That he caused the 789 bales to be
branded/with his initials and his private mark; That he had.
appointed Mann his agent to take charge of the cotton in
his name and for his benefit, and that Mann acted as his
agent accordingly; That, by reason of the w'ar, he was unable to bring the cotton to market, but that he had expended
large sums and much time and labor in "protecting" it;
That, at the time of entering into the contract, he executed
the two notes mentioned, which were to beheld by Hall as

security for the proceeds of the cotton, and that these notes
were still in the possession of Hall; That he was then able
and desirous to bring the cotton to New Orleans for sale,
and had made a demand for it ol Hall and Mann, but that
they had neglected and refused to deliver it, to his damage
ill the sum of $50,000.
He subsequently filed an amended petition, in which he
sets forth: That the contract between himself and Hall was
entered into by the permission of the major general commanding the Department of the Gulf, expressed in general
o'ders-Coppell being then engaged in business in New
Orleans, and Hall living in that city; That the notes, mentioned in the contract, are held by Hall and Mann, or have
been transferred by them to other parties; That, on the 14th
of September, 1863, Mann sold and delivered to Hall 1169
bales of cotton, then on the plantation of Mann; and that
Hall, in part execution of his contract, designated and transferred this cotton to Coppell; That Coppell-" protected" the
cotton, and that Mann continued to hold it in trust for him
and Hall, untilthe Confederate armies, under the command
of General Richard B. Taylor, surrendered to the forces of
the United States, when Mann and Hall, colluding to defeat
the trust, refused to allow Coppell to bring the cotton to
New Orleans, according to the contract; That this cotton is
the same which was sequestered in this suit, and that he is
entitled to the possession of it.
The original and supplemental answers of Hall and Mann
set up the following defences: That the cotton was situated
in territory under the control of the rebel authorities, and
that the contract was entered into there; that the object of
the contract was the protection of the cotton, within the
rebel lines, by Coppell, as the British consul, and its transportation to New Orleans during the war then raging; that
the contract was thus in violation of the laws of the United
States; of the neutral obligations of the plaintiff, as British
consul and a resident of the United States; and of public
policy; and was null and void; that the plaintiff lost all right
and interest in the contract by leaving Louisiana before the

restoration of peace, and that the defendants were thereby
released from all liability upon the contract; that, if the
contract should .be held valid, the defendants claimed damages, by way of reconvention, for breach of the contract by
the plaintiff, in neglecting to remove the cotton to New
OFeans, and to sell it as he had agreed to do.
In reply'to the reconventlonal demand, the plaintiff replied that he'was the consul of her British Majesty; that he
did protect the cotton from all seizures which his agreement
included; and that, as soon as the military situation permitted, hd was ready and willing to perform all the stipulations of his agreement, and tendered the necessary means
for the transportation of the cotton to New Orleans; which
tender the defendants declined.
Upon -this state of the pleadings the cause proceeded to
trial. The parol evidence is not as fully set out as should
have been done; but the controlling facts sufficiently appear.
The plaintiff gave in evidence the military orders of the
department commander of the 7th of March and the 8d of
September, 1863. By these orders the trade of the Mississippi, within the Department of the Gulf, was permitted,
subject to such restrictions only as should be necessary to
prevent the supply of provisions and munitions of war to the
enemy. The products of the country were authorized to be,
brought to New Orleans, and other designated points within
the military lines of the United States, and to be sold by
the proprietors or their factors "for the legal currency of the
United States, without restriction or confiscation." New
Orleans,was then in the military possession of the United
States.
The cotton was all within the rebel lines. This sta'te of
things continued until the surrender of the rebel forces
under General Taylor. Consular certificates were given by
the plaintiff, each setting forth that the cotton therein re-'
ferred to was "the property of a British subject."
In the progress of the trial numerous exceptions were
taken by the defendants. Some of them relate to the reT
jection of testimony; the residue to instructions given, or

refused. The view which we take of the case renders it
necessary to consider only those which relate to the legdlity
of the contract. They are the 2d, 7th, 8th, and 9th. The
2d, 8th, and 9th, taken together, show that the court, in
instructing the jury, substantially affirmed the following

propositions:
That the demand for reconvention, set ,ip by the defendants, "Clcurd any nullity or illegality in tWe contract, if any
existed, and that, under the pleadings, the plaintiff might
recover, notwithstanding such illegality."
That the military orders, then in force, authorized and
gave validity to the contract.
That Hall and the plaintiff both residing in New Orleans,
the contract was valid under the law of nations.
It appears, by the 7th bill of exceptions, that the defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if the cotton,
referred to in the contract, was at the tipme of its sale situated in territory which was under the permanent control
of the Confederate forces, the same was enemy property;
and that if it was in the contemplation of the parties that
the plaintiff, acting as British consul at New Orleans, 'or as
a British subject resident in New Orleans, should extend
British protection over said cotton, and should "issue his
official certificates, as British consul, that the cotton was
the property of a Biitish subject-, for the protection of the
same within lines occupied by the enemy during the war;
and that such protection formed a part of the consideration
of the contract; then the contract was contrary, to the laws
of the United, States, to the law of nations, to public policy,
and to good morals, and that said contract was, therefore,
hull and void." The court refused to give this instruction.
The reason assigned for the reftisal'was, "that the proof was
that both parties were, residents and domiciled in New
Orleans; and that the court could not charge upon a supposed case which did not exist."
It does'not appear to us that this, objection to giving th 9
instruction asked was well taken. Qonceding the fact that
the parfes did -oth reside in New Orleans, the insti-uctions

.met exactly.the eyigencies of the pase. If the defendants
were. right asto the legal views upon which they insisted,
the instruction should have been given. If they were wrong
i4 those views, it was properly refused,, Th point thus presented-will be considered in connection with those arising
upon the instructions which were given.

If guilty of illegal or improper conduct, the exequatur which

consul, in all that concerns his trade, is liable in the same
way as a native merehant.t The.character of consul does
not give any protection to that of merchant when they are

By the terms 6f the. contract, Hall was to ,"furnish" the
cotton to Coppell. It was all within the rebel liues, and
was, therefore, enemy property. Coppell was fo cause it to
be "protected."
If there coauld be any doubt -ab'out the,
meaning of this phrase as used in the contract, it is dispelled
by the cohduct of Coppell in issuing the consular certificates,
that the cotton which they coVered 'respectively was ,' the
property of a British subject." He was to receive the cotton
-in the rebel territ6ry, to make an advance upon it there, to
transport ft to Nfew Orleans, and there, to sell it for the
benefit of the contracting parties. The contract was one of
factorage. Aside from the question of illegality, it is clear'
that no title passed to Coppell. He was to have, and had
no share in the acquisition of the cotton by Hall.' His duties
were tb protect it; to receive it; to advance money upon ii;
to transport it; to 'sell:it, and to account to Hall for his share
of the proceeds.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Itwas doubtless expected that the .insurgent authorities
and the insurgent population would respect the rights of the
"British subject." If the surging tide of war should sweep
back the rebel arms, and the national forces should penetrate
to the localities of the cotton, the custodian would be ready,
in every instance, to produce the consular certificate.
These certificates, even if issued in good faith, were nullities, and could give no immunity; yet it might well be
hoped that the authorities of the United States, instead of
seizing the cotton jure belli, and disposing of it according to
the act relating to captured and abandoned property, would
ex gratia waive their rights, and yield up the property to the
ostensible British owner, whose claim was fortified by such
a muniment of title. The parties intended to delude and
defraud the United States. The means used were the certificates issued by the consul.
When the contract was entered into the rebellion had
become a civil war of large proportions. Important belligerent rights were conceded to the insurgents by the govern=
ment of the nation. The war, in qiany of its aspects, was
conducted as if it had been a public one with a foreign
enemy.* When international wars exist, all commerce between the countries of the belligerents, unless permitted, is
contrary to public policy, and all contracts growing out of
such commerce are illegal. Such wars are regarded not as
wars of the governments only, but of all the inhabitants of
their respective countries. The sovereign may license trade,
but in so far as it is done, it is a suspension of war, and a
return to the condition of peace. It is said there cannot be,
at the same time, war for arms and peace for commerce.
The sanction of the sovereign is indispensable for trade. -A
state of war ipso facto forbids it. The government only can
relax the rigor of the rule.t

The 5th 'section of the"act of July i'6th

1861,

authotized the President to proclaim any State, or .part of
a State, in/a condition of insurrection, and it declared that

,thereupqn all commercial intercourse between that territory
and the citizens of the rest of the United States should be;
unlawful so long as hostilities should continue, and that all
goods and mercharndise, coming from such teriitory into
other parts of the .United States, and all proceeding to such
territory by land 6r water, and the vessel or vehicle conveying them, should be forfeited. It was enacted in a proviso
that the President might permit commercial intercourse with
any part of such territory -" in such articles, and for such
time, and by such. persons" as he might deem proper, and
that "such intercourse, so far as' by him licensed," should
be "carried on only in pursuance of rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury."
On the 10th of August, 1861, the President issued a proclamation declaring the inhabitants of the rebel States-including Louisiana and Mississippi-in a state of insurrection. Certain local exceptions, not necessary to be stated,'
were made.
By a proclamation of the 31st of March, 1863, it was declared that the inhabitants of the same States, with certain'
local exceptions, of which :New Orleans was one, were in a
state of insurrection, and that all commercial intercourse,
not licensed according to the act before mentioned, "between those States, the inhabitants thereof, with the exceptions aforesaid, and the citizens of other States," was unlawful, and that all products, goods, and chattels coming from

tional and within the rebel lines of military occupation;
across these lines there can be no intercourse, except that
of a character exclusively military."
Amongst the treasury regulations framed under the act
of 1861, in force when the contract was entered into, was
the following:
"VII. Commercial intercourse with localities beyond the
lines of military occupation by the United States forces, is
strictly prohibited; and no permit will be granted for the
transportation of any property to any place under the control of insurgents against the United States."

beyond the sphere of the power and duties of the military
authorities.* These orders may be laid out of view. They
can in no wise affect the case.
The stipulations in the contract as to everything Coppell
was to do in the rebel territory was contrary to public policy,
to the law of nations, to the act of Congress, to the proclamation of the President, and to the regulations of the Treasury
Department.
The protection to be given, if effectual, might have deprived the United States of pecuniary means to the extent of

the result as much as putting into the other. The objection
rests upon the samie principle as insuring enemy property.

the common law.* Such contracts are not only illegal and
void, but repugnant to every principle of public policy. The
law will not permit the citizen, in the perils of'war, to subject himself to such a temptation to swerve from hiÂ§ duty tb
his country. In Bell v. -Pollsit was held to be illegal for a
British subject, in time of war, without a license; to bring,
even in a neutral ship from an enemy's port, goods purchased by his agent resident. in the enemy's country, after
the commencement of hostilities. In Antoine v. Jorsheadt
an alien in an eiemy's country during war, drew a bill on a
British subject, resident in England, and, afte' peace, sued
for the amount of the bill. The same rule was reluctantly
appliq4 by Chief Justice Gibbs. It was held that the plaintiff could not recover. If the course of the transaction had
been reversed, the result would have been the same. The
same rule would have been applied in the British courts.
The payment of inoney by a subject of on'e of fhe belligerents, in the country of another, is condemned, and all
.contracts and securities looking to that end are illegal and
void.t
The adjudications of this court have always proceeded
upon the same principles.
In the case fBrown v. The United States, Mr. Justice Story
said that ' no principle Y~as better settled than thai all contracts made withan enemy during war were utterly void:"
In the case of The .Raid,Â§the facts were, that an Ameri"can citizen bought English goods in England before the war,
and deposited them on an island belonging to the English,
near the province of Maine. Upon the breaking out of the
war he sent the Rapid from Boston to the island to brirfg
away the goods. Upon her return she was captured by'an
Ameripan privateer. The goods were condemned as lawful
prize. It was held that the vessel, while thus engaged, was

Opinion of the court.

trading with the enemy, and that the goods had acquired
the character of enemy's property. Mr. Justice Story, in
delivering his opinion in the court below, said: "That not'
only all trading, in its ordinary acceptation, but all communication and intercourse with the enemy were prohibited.
That it was in no wise important whether the property engaged in the inimical communication be b6ught or sold, or
merely transported and shipped. That the contamination
of forfeiture was consummate the moment the property became the object, of illegal intercourse."
In the case of The Julia,* the vessel was condemned only
because, on sailing from Baltimore to Lisbon, and reurning, she had carried a license from a British admiral, issued
within our territory by a British agent.
In Griswold v. Waddi}yeton,'Kent, C. J., said: "The law
had put the sting of disability into every kind of voluntary
communication and contract with an enenly, Which is made
without the special permission of the government. There
is w'sdom and policy, patriotism and safety in this principle,
and every relaxation of it tends to corrupt the allegiance of
the subject, and to prolong the calamities of war."
The instruction given to the jury, that if the contract was
illegal the illegality had been waived by the reconventional
demand of the defendants, was founded upon a misconception of the law. In such cases there can be no waiver. The
defence is allowed, not for the sake of the defendant, but of
the law itself. The p'rinciple is indispensable to the purity

of its administration. It will not enforce what it has forbidden and denounced. The maxim, ex dolo malo non oriluractio,
is limited by no such qualification. The proposition to the
contrary strikes us as hardly worthy of serious refutation.
Whenever the illegality appears, whether the evidence comes
from one side or the other, the disclosure is fatal to the case.
No consent of the defendant can neutralize its effect. A stipulation in the most solemn form to waive the objection, would
be tainted with the vice of the original contract, and void for

COCKS V. IZARD.
A bill in equity, by the owner of real estate, sold at public judicial sale, will
lie against a person who, at such sale, has made untrue representations,
which prevent other persons from bidding, and by which he has so,
himself, got the property at an undervalue. The original owner is not
confined to seeking relief through the summary modes, such as motion
to'set aside tho sale, which it was within the power of the court fromiL
which the execution issued, to grant. Maier v. Maxwell (6 Wallace, 276),
affirmed.

from the Circuit Court of Louisiana.
During the late rebellion, one Anderson, by a proceeding
in what was known as "the Provisional Court of Louisiana"
-a court established by proclamation of the President, in
October, i862, when the insurrection which had prevailed in
Louisiana, had temporarily subverted and swept away the
judicial authori ties of the Union, and which, by the terms
of its constitution, was to last only until " the restoration of
the civil authority"-brought some sort of suit against one.
Cocks.
The suit proceeded to execution; and, on execution, the
marshal of the said Provisional Court exposed to public
sale certain real estate owned by Cocks, in New Orleans,
and worth $15,000. Cocks was a resident of Mississippi,
