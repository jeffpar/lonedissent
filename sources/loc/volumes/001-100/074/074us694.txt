agreement of parties, and without an appeal allowed or writ, of error
served.

from the Circuit Court for Iowa, as on a writ of error, by
agreement bf parties, and without the issuing or service of such a
writ. Coming before this court on a printed argument for the
defendant in error, and the fact above-mentiofied being observed by the court, the appeal was DISMISSED; the CHIEF
JUSTICE stating it to be the opinion of the court, that an
appeal allowed or a writ of error served, was essential to the
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.

AUSTIN

v. THE

ALDERMEN.

If a State statute, passed in professed exercise of an authority given by Congress to the States to pass such a statute, does not deprive, contrary to
the act of Congress, the party to the suit, of any right, nor work, as to
him, any effect which the act of Congress forbids, this court cannot, on
the case being brought here by such party, on the ground that the State

statute violated the act of Congress, declare the State statute void.
